2.0,"I have wasted too much money trying to find loose fitting tops like in the picture, even when ordering 2XL and still too snug and NOT comfy.  Once again I fell into the trap.  Made in China, do I need to say more??"
2.0,"Eh it was ok, I didn‚Äôt like how the material looked so stretchy to the flowers looked odd. If I didn‚Äôt wear it I would have returned it but I needed it the same day I got it."
2.0,"Nice mask, but the otter is not centered like in the picture. Was disappointed that on the mask I received, otter was missing its eye / whole right side of its face."
2.0,I bought these to avoid thigh rub under a dress. They slid down with every step I took.
2.0,"While the necklace was beautiful, the clasp would never securely clip. Only reason it stays on is due to the side clasps, the main clasp doesn‚Äôt stay clipped. Kind of expect a better clasp and not broken on arrival. Unfortunately this has to be returned."
2.0,Did not like that the top was wide open and would need a tank top. Returned it.
2.0,"I ordered these leggings a year ago, and they were perfect - thick, tighter in the tummy tucking area, color matched online pictures. BUT THEN I ordered them a week ago - completely different. The color doesn‚Äôt match the picture (specifically grey), the leggings are very thin, there‚Äôs already a hole in the seem, and it‚Äôs so stretchy that it doesn‚Äôt stay up well (especially in the tummy). And you can see through them! Very disappointing."
2.0,It's cut with too much of a taper which makes the size way too small.  I ordered a 2x  it fits like a size 12.  I will be returning this.
2.0,"Bought a size up, which I'm glad I did, but I still thought it was a little snug.  Also, I bought White, and it was too see through for me.  I'm sending it back.  I had better luck with the almost exact same blouse found on Amazon under &#34;LILBETTER Women's Loose Casual Short Sleeve Chiffon Top T-shirt Blouse.&#34;  That product is true to size, unlike this one."
2.0,Flimsy don't hold up.  Sad.
2.0,Loved the look .. however they broke after only a few wears üò©
2.0,Cute sweater. Color matched what was shown. Very thin material. Shoddy seam work. See pictures. The right shoulder seam had a 1 inch hole that was not sewn together. The right under arm seam had a glob of string hanging from it.
2.0,VERY LOUD watch.
2.0,This is a nice dress but the fabric is very thin.
2.0,Decent pants but the crotch is way too low and wide.
2.0,"This little bag is gorgeous. But the one we got had loose sequins in the bag and loose threads that were dripping off more sequins. The lining makes it impossible to repair nicely, so we had to return it. Too bad, it really is pretty."
2.0,"Not quality made, no way to shape back once you take it off, the seams don't align with the rest of the material!"
2.0,"There seems to be something about the friction of bare skin that makes this most effective.  However, I need to wear a bra, so I didn't find this product worth the expense. I gave the overall fit 'as expected' because it to get the body to fit me the shoulders were a bit loose, which defeats the purpose."
2.0,"Not flattering on my body, and not especially high-quality velvet. I'm planning to return it"
2.0,"So I would love love to give this 5 starts but alas I have purchased this beautiful bracelet twice, only to have it break. The 2nd time I think it broke on my 1st wearing. I'm delicate with my jewelry. The 1st time I probably got a solid month or to out of it, hence why I purchased it again to give it another try. Now I have put out hundreds of dollars I'm really bummed. I will add before it broke that it was my favorite bracelet  & felt like a dream to wear. Ughhh...so tempted to try again but will learn my lesson."
2.0,The glasses are to high on face and far away..they don‚Äôt fit right and feel cheap
2.0,Didn't not cover my stomach was too small i will be returning for a wider one
2.0,Much bigger than expected and not very fitted like it looks. The material is shiny and slick and not my style. I returned.
2.0,PROS:<br />affordable<br />Durable<br />Strong<br /><br />CONS:<br />No half sizes<br />Wont allow the skin to breathe (causing scaly dry skin)<br /><br />Overall. It comes down to comfort and strength. Although it has these is it really worth the irritation from lack of air getting under your ring? Go with a groove ring on this one or something comparable.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt even fit my 12 year olds head.
2.0,Hat is thick but the bunny on top of it is not cute. Ugliest bunny I‚Äôve ever seen.
2.0,"I was not impressed with this sweater when it arrived but loved the design and wanted to give it a shot. I washed it (according to directions) and it shrunk a lot. For what it cost, this is not a good value in my opinion."
2.0,I bought this so i would not have a buckle digging into stomach and to help hold my jeans up.  It did work but i had to tighten soooo tight it was riding up my low back.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium , but I bought a large and it fits like a small."
2.0,Cheap and very smal
2.0,Not a good quality.  After used it for 2 month the front part of the shoe is broken.
2.0,"Ring fit is small. I ordered a full size up from my usual and it pinches into my skin. The decorations on the shank also stab into neighboring fingers making it uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. Even WORSE if you have sensitive skin. The side stones on mine are two different shades of blue. The main stone is dull, lifeless, and has no sparkle or dazzle even with cleaning and polishing. Super disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"The size is exactly what is described, however, the color is not at all tan/beige.  It is a very powder pink color.  I have been unable to use this purse as I have wanted to."
2.0,"I used for a dive bar theme Birthday party. Im not country so I thought this was a perfect country style top. When I received the tank top my first impression was that it was so thin, the stitching of the shirt was very delicate(see through) and the print on the shirt felt pretty low quality. Overall the shirt fit good, looked good and went with the theme but the quality of the shirt was not it."
2.0,The boy shorts do not have a secure elastic to prevent movement while in the water.  Also shorts are unflattering to large sizes.
2.0,The clear eye protection panel was cloudy and did not allow good vision. The vision protection panel did not fit well when someone is wearing glasses.
2.0,Although the dress was beautiful and fit perfectly it ripped along the slit the very first time I wore it :(.
2.0,"Shoes are cool enough, but the LED barely ever works, no matter how often you charge it."
2.0,The quality is not the best though.  But I love the fit.
2.0,"The pads in the bra are ridiculous, they fold over, get bunched up and are nearly impossible to get in the right position. I‚Äôll never buy a racer back style again - it‚Äôs a wrestling match in the locker room trying to get this suit off when the fabric is wet. I even cut the band inside the suit, still, it‚Äôs difficult to get out of the suit. Bad design."
2.0,The eyeball fell out in just a few days of owning it.
2.0,One pair of these bad boys got a hole in the crotch (and I'm not particularly well-endowed) within a week of me wearing them. Would not recommend.
2.0,"I normally wear a medium, but ordered a large for a little extra room.  Had to return - the large was more like an X-large."
2.0,The color and pattern are very pretty.  Material seems pretty cheap though compared to others.
2.0,"Extremely tiny, no time to replace before tonight"
2.0,"Cute, but got dirty easy and showed the use really fast."
2.0,I ordered a Medium and it looked like a muscle shirt with huge arm hole cutouts. Thought it would be more of a tank top style  fit.
2.0,"These thermal tops are indeed warm, but I found they fit poorly. I am 5‚Äô 7‚Äù and the thermal top ‚Äúrode up‚Äù constantly. I think the tops need greater length through the shoulder so the bra portion stays in place. I ordered two sizes to see of scaling up would be helpful, and it wasn‚Äôt. Also, the bra cups I received on both tops were heavily creased to the point of being visible through the shirt I wore over my thermal top. Perhaps washing would  help, but the creases are disappointing until then.  Finally, the straps on this garment are so wide that they are visible under nearly every neck line in my closet. The thermal top peeks out constantly unless you‚Äôre wearing a turtleneck."
2.0,"I had the notion that this would be a nice top for my wife, but sadly this falls short of wearable. The material itself is very thin and cheap. So thin, in fact, that you will need to wear a shirt under it or risk a shirt over it as you risk exposing yourself. The material is very prone to wrinkling as well. Not sure if that is by design, or just a product of the material chosen. The color/printing would be nice were it not for the fact that it is so thin that it loses color from the low thread density. This could be a very nice if better fabric is chosen."
2.0,Bought an XL for my father who wears a 38 pant.  Didn't even come close to being able to zip closed.
2.0,"Our daughter loves her blue sequins dance costume...unfortunately after wearing it she was complaining her arms hurt from it. We checked to find a bunch of tiny scratches under both arms, she had got from the sequins some of them were even bleeding. This dress cut her up. As beautiful as it is, and as well as it fit. She will not be able to wear it anymore. It made us all very sad."
2.0,"Purchased the youth size for my daughter,  however,  very small. Size is not as expected. Pretty disappointed."
2.0,I give this wig a two star rating because it was not curled the way it was in the picture. It gets two stars because it was blonde and a wig.
2.0,"I wanted a head piece I coul lift weights with, but it was too tight on my head and was bad for circulation."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt cafe for this brand of watch bands. The color not as vibrant as shown on Amazon and the texture of the bands poor quality co pared the ones I purchased prior on Amazon. Thank you for asking for my review!
2.0,String fell off early and my toddler popped the eyes off which could probably be a choking hazard. We‚Äôre using now without the string or eyes but not what I was hoping for.
2.0,The gems fall out easy and the head also unscrews constantly. I like the size though and its a good thing there are so many to replace thebroken ones.
2.0,"Very cute, but the bottoms were way too small that my fat was popping out and the top was hurting my neck."
2.0,"They worked well for the event That I bought them for; however, they broke the second time I wore them."
2.0,"I always wear a S/M band, but this one is too small.  Have to wear it on the very last hole and is uncomfortable."
2.0,Easily slip on and off...not that great for walking babies/toddlers.
2.0,"It is huge. Your nose should be longer and the hole should be near your brain. It looks and fits nothing like the picture. It looks like a thin, but large hoop hanging out of your nose."
2.0,I love the bracelet and the look of the stones but it just randomly snapped on me with regular use. I never went swimming with it or worked out with it on but the cord snapped and beads were lost so i cannot do anything.
2.0,"The first small links connecting the key rings to the body of the key chain broke within a couple of days of purchase.  So, I just linked the body directly to the key rings without using the link.  That took care of that problem.<br /><br />The button that you push to release the valet portion of the key can weaken over time and needs to be bent to reinforce it's ""grip.""  Otherwise, your valet key (in my case, the key to my wife's car which she asks for when she loses her own) will slide off over time.<br /><br />So this key chain does the job, but it is a poorly constructed and needs some fiddling with to overcome its flaws.  I would not have expected this given its price."
2.0,I was so excited to get for my small purse and just after two days it ripped and the zipper broke.
2.0,These run very small. I wish the elastic had more stretch. I'm 235 5'4 and ordered XL and didn't fit üòî
2.0,The backings broke on almost all of these within a few weeks.
2.0,These are very ugly on the feet and are extremely ill-fitting.  I can't even get the zip up.  The only good thing about this shoe is that it's real leather....hence the 2 stars rating.
2.0,Very poor quality glovr
2.0,Ute shirt but overpriced nothing fancy  about it
2.0,"I liked the concept of ""clear"".  But other than that everything fell short of my expectations.  They are stiff and not flexible at all.  They do not conform to facial features and squash the nose.<br />They protrude outward making me feel like I am wearing a duck bill or something.  Very uncomfortable.  I though maybe I could tailor them to be a bit more comfortable but aside from literally reconstructing them...not gonna happen.  I am better off tossing them and starting from scratch."
2.0,I like that it is soft but it feels like it rides down after walking/moving. I‚Äôm a medium in everything and I am constantly hiking these up to not feel the top seem going lower and lower
2.0,No comments. My mistake. I should have looked at the dimensions
2.0,This did not work for me.  I want to return them
2.0,"The shirt fit like a small, not a medium shirt."
2.0,They dont stay closed they are hard to keep locked
2.0,"I ordered blue and turquoise and they came so wrinkled, they have to be ironed and they are very thin but would be nice in the spring or fall."
2.0,"It's beautiful, but it doesn't fit a cartilage piercing or helix piercing. Returning it."
2.0,I was wanting a compression tank.  I am an 8-10.  The small was way too tight and the Med. was way too big!
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt pleased with this skirt at all. The material didn‚Äôt look like the pic .
2.0,The still slide down in my shoe............still searching for nylon ankle fitting!
2.0,It fits nicely and feels nice but you can‚Äôt at ALL read what it‚Äôs supposed to say.
2.0,I don't like the size of beads and cross. too big for my arm//I contacted seller to return but haven't heard back
2.0,They were a little small and not as cute as I was hoping
2.0,It is crazy that such poorly built socks cost so much. The socks I received have strings hanging off and look like they are already coming apart. I love the designs but these socks are simply not worth it. I bet someone could make a fortune if they sold better built socks with great designs for much cheaper.
2.0,"Looks cheap in person.  Way too small for my head, and the hat is not stretchy at all."
2.0,You get what you pay for.  I sent it right back.
2.0,Why did you sent me a damage item my sunglasses is thom browne thats very expensive look at the pic  its not cool bro you sent me a product with many dents smh
2.0,My son hated this it is good when he falls back but caused him to fall over too much and get the side of his head we used it maybe 3 times definitely wouldn‚Äôt buy another one
2.0,It folds down when bending over and other movements. I‚Äôm constantly adjusting it.
2.0,"If you're like me, and the rubbing up of big seams against your body bothers you then you need to pass on these! Never felt seams so much as ididin these pants, which is a real shame I liked everything else. The material is light weight and stretches nicely. But for the seams I had to return them. They stick out way to far inside."
2.0,I usually wear a 2x.  This product ran about 2 sizes small.  NOT HAPPY.
2.0,Liked it but to small
2.0,They are really cute but fell apart right out of the package. Jewelry glue will fix them so not a huge deal I suppose.
2.0,These boots look nothing like on the picture!! Their cheap made and not the color it shows!! üòê
2.0,This was not what I had expected. It is a pin that comes with a chain on the side. It is not a necklace but the pin is good quality.
2.0,Size 2 sizes small.  Item not as shown in photo.  Decent quality outside of that
2.0,"I originally ordered the Ice Cream design for summer, but received the Cupcake one instead. I personally do not like the cupcake one and when I tried to get the issue fixed they only offered me a refund after months of waiting... so kind of disappointed. However I did not want to waste my money so I did start using the cupcake purse and although I would have preferred the Ice Cream I always receive compliments on the Cupcake. Chain has broken after 2months of vigorous use but it was an easy fix."
2.0,I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 145 lbs and normally wear a size 8 so i ordered a medium and they were so tight! I‚Äôm going to try a large and see if they‚Äôre any better but I wanted to let people know they run small
2.0,Loved this ring until the mysterious material of the gem gave me a rash of some sort. The bar may be surgical steel but the gem is not and I'm apparently allergic to it. Beware if you have sensitive skin.
2.0,"Sooo. First the dress is just OK. The material is something like you‚Äôd find at Charlotte Rousse or the like. The dress I received had the tag cut out so clearly it was used and returned. Regardless, even the shapewear shows through this dress so unless your body is PERRRRFECCTT underneath ... this isn‚Äôt the garment for you."
2.0,So of course you have to order few sizes up but I already knew that and ordered up- the dress fit ok but the arms cut at an awkward length and the pattern was seen on really tilted really making the dress look off and weird.
2.0,It was way too small. I gave it too my daughter. Fits more like a small/medium size. It looks very cute on her!
2.0,"Runs extremely small. I've ordered two of these...the first one was a medium for my daughter who usually wears that size. It was so small I gave it to a friend who usually wears an extra small. Fit her perfectly. I then ordered an extra large for my daughter and it fit her perfectly. Nice shirt, looks professional looking but runs very, very small."
2.0,small head
2.0,"This is a nice dress, fits a little loose in the bust, no built in bra. I don‚Äôt think the quality is worth $50. It‚Äôs a nice thick cotton but I would expect to pay more like $20."
2.0,Front plate is magnetically attached and fell off early and often.  Easy no questions asked return on the part of the manufacturer.  Otherwise as described.
2.0,"I thought this would be really cool and my son would love it.  It's not as great as I hoped.  The eyes and nose cannot be changed.  I guess you could build up on the bill of the cap, but you cannot do anything with the face."
2.0,Beautiful dress! But runs small! I am a normal 12-14 and size L in dresses. And M in tops. I ordered the Large as per sizing recommendations. It would barley wrap. And the top basically gaped open exposing half my bra. So even if wearing a camp under it would look like it was an ill fitting dress. I'm a size B so I'm not huge chested. This is more of a juniors sizing for the USA sizing.
2.0,"This is a beautiful watch band and I was so pleased with its comfort. However, after a week the flowers began to peel off. I would buy this again, only if they can find a solution to the problem."
2.0,to big of a peal liked it other wise
2.0,If you have thick calfs these are not for you.
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 28 waist, 36C, 34 hips. I love hoodies. This was a huge miss. I ordered my normal size small. It fits, but the fit is not flattering at all on me. It makes my hips look much bigger than they are. The pockets are in a terrible spot and they poof out. The material is awful. It‚Äôs not sweatshirt material, it‚Äôs not tshirt material nor is it like terry. It feels like a mix of cotton and athletic material. I gave it an honest shot and it was uncomfortable to wear all day. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get it off. The material attracts all the lint and dog hair. By the end of the day wear was already showing on the shoulders.  I‚Äôd give it one star but I‚Äôm going to crop it and make it into a gym hoodie so I‚Äôll actually wear it again."
2.0,The fabric feels cheap . It also runs small.
2.0,"My husband works nights and uses these to help with light. He likes that they are lightweight however,  they bleed with sweat. I washed these twice by themselves to alleviate more bleeding and it hasn't stopped. I have had 3 sets of pillow cases ruined."
2.0,"Gorgeous Dress.  I ordered a size larger per the other reviews and it fit great.  However, the back is completely see-through/sheer just like the sleeves.  If it were a lined dress or a better quality material in the back, I would get it in each color.  The description says gauze, but gauze is thicker than the back of this dress."
2.0,"The fabric is thin and it is a printed style, it is not a few fabric sewed together."
2.0,"Had this umbrella for 2 months, and the color is already extremely sun faded. Other than that the umbrella itself is great!"
2.0,"Slipper is comfortable, but the seam on the top has split at the toe in less than 2 months. At this price, I expect them to last more than 6 weeks. This slipper did not meet that expectation."
2.0,"I hate the material. It has the type of cuffs at the end of the sleeves that stretch out, (that really annoys me) The colors are great."
2.0,"The item stripped off,couldn't let my daughter wear it so I sent it back."
2.0,It was cute... until it broke ...
2.0,I should have returned it.<br />Cheap quality. When working along kitchen counters (cooking) the fabric ends up with tiny white slubs from its white base (showing in 2nd photo). The contrast between the actual white material + the black print is too much.<br />I ordered medium and it feels like (x)x-large.
2.0,"I now have 4 of these devices.  I purchased 3 a few years ago, which is why I bought a 4th.  The most recent purchase is a huge disappointment from prior experience.<br /><br />The loop now is thin and feels fragile, whereas in the past the loop felt sturdy.  Same price, less quality."
2.0,"We have had this set of luggage for 2 years.  Each piece has been used a handful of times.  2 years later we are nearly ready to dispose of all pieces.  All are in disrepair in some way (i.e., straps are broken, wheels are coming undone, exterior of damage has cracked or split.  I do not recommend this set of luggage.  Had hoped it would be better.  Now shopping for more luggage."
2.0,It has an inner layer or clothe for protection. The gaiter itself is thick material. So the two layers of clothe combined with the tightness makes it very difficult to breathe.
2.0,The broke after 3 days of wearing it.
2.0,Cute but pilled right away
2.0,Well this caps were good for the first 3 uses. After the 4th wash the color just started to fade and got wrinkled to the point were not even ironing them will straighten them out. The button placement hurts my ears so the only solution is just to cut them out.
2.0,The print is the same but the fabric is not and the dress stops above the knee. It is NOT the same dress as the photo. It‚Äôs not a bad dress but it‚Äôs definitely not as long as it should be. Also the bottom is not completely hemmed.
2.0,I didn‚Äôt even try this on. Didn‚Äôt like the waist band and fabric. Looks cute in picture but is lacking style in person
2.0,Short in arms and length
2.0,"Cheap, probably would be best for girls with a smaller bust. I didn't look right on me."
2.0,This is very cheaply made. The &#34;silver&#34; on the charms was not smooth and had raised flecks in it which almost looked like small bubbles in the finish. This was a gift for my three granddaughters so I was disappointed that it looked so cheap.
2.0,"the shortest chain and the bar are pretty but I don't like the disc charm at all. the color of the disk doesn't look anything like the gold color of the chain Also, as you wear it, the chains start to get all wrapped up around each other. I know it's cheap jewelry so I won't give it 1 star. Plus if you are sensitive to nickel you will really hate this."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this jacket but it was huge :( I am 5ft. 1, 108lbs, 34B, naturally petite. The XS was huge on me. I think it would have looked really cool if it would have fit. The return was seamless and fast."
2.0,"Digital screens are oddly unreadable with these glasses on. Also, they sit strangely on your nose."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like how it looked. The material was thin.
2.0,"The watch is like picture, but it is not working, it has not show right time since I got it. Thinking of changing batteries and see if it will work"
2.0,I've ordered other Kush sunglasses.  They were sturdy and came with a case.<br />These frames are cheap and not as sturdy as other Kush sunglasses.  The glassed came without a case. Just in an envelope<br />Disappointed!!!!
2.0,"They're okay, the color is brown, but super shiny and the ends of the bracelet is irritating, nor is it a bad product"
2.0,"Shirt runs small, cute design though. Was going to return but no free returns, not worth the shipping to send back."
2.0,Heals broke very easily right at the seam
2.0,Bought largest size and it fits my 10 year old.
2.0,Very cheap material. Thin spandex like material. I don't know if I'll wear it. Its been in the closet for months now.
2.0,"I love how cute these boots are, but I'm usually a 7.5 (US) and these are just a bit too big.<br />I want to exchange them for a 7 to see if it's just the size, or if this style doesn't work for me. However, when I went on to exchange them, I get a notice that returns are not accepted, but I can't find anything on the listing that says that. (If anyone can find their contact info, I'd love for you to reply and send it to me. It's gotta be there but I'm just blind rn)<br />I'm not going to order another pair that I can't return if they don't fit my feet well, so for the time being they're sitting in the box, begging to be worn. Still trying to figure it out, and will update the review if/when I find a solution.<br />*Note*My only thick socks are tall, which sort of defeats the purpose of ankle boots*"
2.0,"Not big enough for all the cords, cord holders, and plugs."
2.0,It‚Äôs nothing near the color red shown on the website.  It‚Äôs pale and more orange and the fabric is stiff and cheap.  No way I‚Äôm wearing it.
2.0,"First of, make sure you order slightly smaller than you normally would. A XXL fits like a 4X. I should‚Äôve gone with just an XL. Also, don‚Äôt order burgundy unless you want a very bright red. Burgundy is not bright red and should be a much darker almost maroon color. What I was received was straight red."
2.0,I really disappointed with the product I was expecting better quality but is not that soft I compare this product from one that  I bought on Walmart and the quality of Walmart is much better it is a lesson for me not to buy clothes on internet
2.0,tight on my head
2.0,I ended up returning this bathing suit it is not at all true to size super tiny
2.0,"I am not rough with my purses, but this one started falling a part after less than a month."
2.0,"Unfortunately missed my return window on this. Amazon shipping had problems so this arrived too late for the event where I had intended to wear it... which I think was fortunate, because this is not a quality product. It's kinda cheap feeling, baggy in weird places, and the v-neck portion seems to be mis-cut or mis-stitched. It looks lopsided.<br /><br />Since I'm stuck with this, guess I'll try to wear it under things that are baggy (??) or find some way to repurpose it. :("
2.0,"Sorry, for me these very cute socks are just too small. While I wear a 81/2-9 shoe, these socks would better fit a foot that is a 7 or less."
2.0,"Pretty cheap material, the sizes are also a little smaller than what you'd expect."
2.0,I loved the way it looked but it turned my hear black and the earing itself turned black as well.
2.0,cute but very cheaply made.  bends easily.
2.0,"If you want your labia showing, buy this swimsuit. If you prefer to keep it PG-13, move on. The top is cute though."
2.0,I don't really know what else to say other then i really don't like it. The first time i washed it the tassels all got knotted up and i have not been able to try to wear it again since. When i was wearing it though however the bottoms are cut small so my cheeks were hanging out. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest/unbiased review.
2.0,It came without sunglasses or it would be 5 star.  We are in Florida so it is nice and thin.  The pink glasses are clearly pictured in the photos but did not come with the package :(  I haven't steamed it in the pic.
2.0,"Less than thrilled with these swim goggles. They are adorable to look at, but keep falling apart during my 4 yr old's swim lessons. The quality seems less than ideal and I have to purchase a new pair now. Too bad, because they really are cute!"
2.0,"This dress is really beautiful with a full skirt, but it has some major design issues. As many others have stated, the fabric is extremely scratchy and itchy, so most will want to wear it with a slip or camisole under. I found it very itchy at the waistband but also at spots where the lace touched my chest and underarms so I'm not sure I could have worn it for a full day without being uncomfortable. The fabric of the dress is pretty heavy and hearty, yet they used the cheapest, wimpiest zipper up the back. It was difficult to zip when laying flat on my bed without anyone in it, but it would not zip past the waist when I had it on, no matter what. It was not tight on me at all (probably could have done with some tailoring to take the seam in), the zipper just wasn't the appropriate size or material for a garment of this weight and stiffness. Sadly I sent it back because I didn't have time to get the zipper replaced before the event I was going to attend."
2.0,"5'7""/175 pds/Rectangle. If you are anything like me (rectangular body) this isn't for us Queen.  Was not flattering on me at all<br /> Definitely runs big...well huge and the bottoms are just awkward. As far as the belt goes it is not sewn on, so unless you know how to tie a pretty bow, well idk what you could do?!"
2.0,I loved these earrings initially and I wore them for months but they eventually turned green.
2.0,Came in a flat package so no shape as it appears to have in the photo. And when I went to tighten the string to make it smaller the whole brim ripped away from the crown.
2.0,I‚Äôm size L and ordered XL and still was too small
2.0,Only ok.
2.0,Hate the material. It‚Äôs awkward and not soft.
2.0,Tested wallet and it is not RFID.  Tried to contact seller using the email address on a card within the wallet and it returned saying not able to deliver email.
2.0,Itchy. Get size up.
2.0,Talla muy grande a la que ordene
2.0,These pants are definitely not red. Wish I had read a previous comment which stated this.  They are burgundy. I bought them to wear with an Ugly Christmas  suit jacket I had purchased but I can't wear them with  jacket because they look terrible since the jacket has no burgundy in it. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Cute shoe, but really poor quality. Poorly finished and uncomfortable. I returned it. If you're looking for comfortable, reasonable summer slides, I would recommend checking out A2 Aerosoles instead."
2.0,"All my other boxers are large size, so I ordered the same and these are too small & uncomfortable, they are also longer then I like."
2.0,"These seem to be good quality, but my package only contained 17 instead of 30 ‚Äî and there were a lot of duplicates so I only actually got 12 different ones ‚Äî and they were all anime characters except for 3! Overall disappointed unfortunately."
2.0,The product was not what I expected.  I do not like the fabric and feel it‚Äôs on the smaller side.<br />I will donate it.
2.0,It did not fit me well. Uncomfortable
2.0,The fit was cute but i felt like the material was see through. And it wasn‚Äôt even wet yet!
2.0,"To be fair, I was using it while surfing, which put the glasses through a lot of battering. However, the design is very poor for any kind of battering. It would need to be connected in a full loop in order to be able to withstand much. But now that pair of glasses are at the bottom of the ocean. Good thing those glasses were only $10. I can't say these straps offer much protection for your glasses unless you have pretty loose glasses. They need a better design."
2.0,"This is definitely not fit to size, WAY too small for what the measurements suggest. I bought this for my husband who is tall and skinny and used the measurement chart provided. I returned the item."
2.0,Small and not comfortable
2.0,Didn't love them as I hoped I would.  :(
2.0,"Cute hat but poor sizing.  It said 2T so I bought it for my 21 month old thinking he could grow into it if needed, and be able to wear for a year or so.  It was huge! It fits my husband!  Not for toddlers at all!"
2.0,"Terrible product. Too small, arms not long enough, waist so short I couldn‚Äôt tuck it in."
2.0,"Received the item 2 weeks late. The chain itself looks and feels fine, only issue is with the pendants clasp that secures it to chain; it is super loud and you here it clank and move around. The pendants weight is double that of the chains weight. Returning this for refund asap!"
2.0,The hat is crooked.  Had to return
2.0,They are very uncomfortable to use.
2.0,Looks cute but material is very thin. Arms too tight.
2.0,Screws are coming out within days of wearing them.
2.0,"Cheap thin material, colors dont look the same and you need to order 2 sizes up. An xl fits like a medium"
2.0,"These socks are beautiful and comfy. It's great to have socks that are actually large enough for big feet. HOWEVER, they are incredibly difficult to GET ON! The tops are very small, with very little stretch. It was a chore to get them on (and I have very skinny feet and ankles). I bought two pairs on Amazon and four pairs through another site to give as gifts. They were so pretty I decided to keep one of the pairs for myself. Imagine my disappointment when I attempted to put mine on! I had already given the others out, so there was no way I could return any of them. I know that none of the people will be able to get them on over their heels, so they won't be able to wear them. Such a waste of quite a bit of money for something that nobody will be able to use! (And embarrassing as well....they must think I got them a cheap gift)  Everything else about these socks is perfect -"
2.0,The design is fine and the manufacturing is adequate. This fabric feels soft but it pills with one or two wearings. It is not the best quality fabric and by the end of one season will probably look shabby. So bear that in mind. This dress has a limited life span. I would say 6 washings and it will look awful.
2.0,"El material no es de mucha calidad, queda muy largo de cuerpo, las mangas quedan muy largas y el logo de Nike queda muy arriba de los dem√°s art√≠culos que tengo, se aprecia como una falsificaci√≥n"
2.0,"Product was too small, was unable to use.  Seller needs a better size chart."
2.0,"Pretty, but super cheap. I just opened this up, went to put it in and it came apart. Don‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,If you have a larger chest this item is not for your. You'll be exposed on the sides. Cute suit just didn't fit me right. Seller provided full refund.
2.0,"I have fallen arches and am slightly over-pronated as a result. So I need good arch support ""where your arch is"". These have an arch that goes completely across the foot bed & hurt. These are discontinued by manufacturer now."
2.0,Too small for the stated size.
2.0,I had to wait a long time to get this and when I received it it was too small.
2.0,I had high hopes for this belt. I work in EMS and was looking for a comfortable belt that could handle the constant strain of the awkward positions I end up in. After my third shift I noticed that the belt had deformed and no longer fit snugly. Very disappointed because I really liked what this company was doing. This belt might be better suited for someone in an office job but it's definitely not suitable to use as a tactical belt.
2.0,The dress that I received was not the dress that is described or shown in this ad. This was a huge inconvenience as it was purchased for an event so I reached out to the seller. They were prompt with my refund.
2.0,Ordered a small and goat an extra extra small
2.0,"I love the fit, the comfort, and the slight camouflage look. I even ordered a second color but this shirt does not wash well. It looked bad after washing it once. But because I love the comfort of it, I kept it and worn and washed again. Take a look at these pictures after two washes- this shirt looks like I‚Äôve had worn it for years! Returning!"
2.0,"Very cheap looking. Not suitable for a child. Very chunky. Says mother on the one I bought, but that was my fault, I didn't notice. Beads don't look like glass beads at all."
2.0,Skirts are really nice but they sent me a 3x instead of 2x. Disappointing
2.0,Im 5&#34;11 230 I would usually were a XL in tanks but from other reviews they say go down a size for it not to be lose. It Fits well the material feels weird on my skin and will take some getting used to. Thery are very short so it rides up when tucked.
2.0,It was much smaller than I expected.  The chain broke after about a week of use.
2.0,Tried to wear regularly and it always turned my skin green. Bummed.
2.0,bottoms too tight for a larger butt
2.0,"Arrived quickly and looks very nice. But.......my old hat measures the same as this one, and i cant even put this hat on. It is way to tight around the rim and there is zero flexbility."
2.0,"Very small!! It looks just like the picture although cheap frabric and wrinkled, so short! It is see through too, would not but if I was you"
2.0,Shrank in the wash.
2.0,"This is my second order. First dress was too big and long. So I ordered short and smaller. Now I find pattern of embroidery is done sloppy, cutting a whole flower pattern to meet the seam right down the front center of the dress which I will see the most. As soon as I tried it on the belt loop broke away, it's just a thin ribbon, maybe for looks only. Very disappointing. I will be sending it back."
2.0,This is great quality would have been very cute had it not been ginormous!!!
2.0,I‚Äôm 5ft tall and the scarf reached my ankles when I left them loose
2.0,because of the fit. it says 32 (34) but its 34 and Not 32
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt as a flowy material like I thought it would be.
2.0,Several of the separators will not close and secure properly on the pandora bracelet for which it was purchased.
2.0,"It was a pretty dress, but quality was definitely lacking (but you get what you pay for) and it was an odd fit - the back seemed shorter than the front. I returned."
2.0,Pants are short/cropped. Not as long as i like
2.0,"This outfit is to big. I bought a large.  It is cute, before I wear alterations will be needed.  The top part of the garment is not well made."
2.0,Size 8F got size S barely compressed my feet just felt like dress socks and digs into middle of back of knee
2.0,Cute but falls apart easily
2.0,I'm normally a small and not even the medium fit
2.0,Using the size chart was not helpful. It was too big and hung below the knee on my 5'4&#34; daughter.
2.0,I purchased a medium which was extremely tight in the bodice. Built in pads have purposefully placed breathing holes- which is a great idea but unable to try due to sizing. Bra pads are placed very close together so it felt odd on the side. Would probably work for a thin 32-34 A-B woman. Order up if you are a C+ cup. (Hopefully the bra pad distance is adjusted)
2.0,"I am 5'3, 115 pounds and am a size D. This is SO SMALL. I ordered a large and wow, it's crazy side boob action. I will say it's got enough &#34;protection&#34;, meaning it's thick enough so you can wear it under shirts, dresses etc. but not alone. Definitely not alone."
2.0,Not even close on the measurement chart. Off by 2-3 inches
2.0,The chest area is tight and material is cheap
2.0,"The actual hoodie did not have the subtle shading that you see in the picture.  It was just a darker blob in the middle, so it doesn't have the optical illusion effect at all."
2.0,the dress was CUTE and it match my skin tone perfectly!!! BUT........ it it was way too small and tight so i will be returning.. order 2 sizes up
2.0,These aren‚Äôt dinosaurs.  It‚Äôs the predator and alien.  Disappointed
2.0,"It was fine in the beginning, but that didn't last long. I used it in a dreadnought acoustic guitar. Not necessarily large in any way. I play at church once a week so it's not under heavy use either. After a few weeks, I noticed the vinyl or plastic-y part of the strap started to split. After about two months of playing I gave up. I don't trust this strap any longer as I believe it will fail soon.<br />  The actual cotton part of the strap is fine. Kind of soft. Certainly not abrasive or bothersome in any regard."
2.0,I liked the way they looked but two days after I got them a lens popped out and I couldn't get it back in.  I promptly lost it in my car and have never found it.  :-(
2.0,I didnt like the quality. Cheap looking.
2.0,"Bought a large. Excellent color and feel but will be returning because they are too long. 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 160lbs"
2.0,Its poor made. It does not look as described. Had to pre wash before wearing it and already looks worn off!!
2.0,Too loose fit.
2.0,One mask was defective when received
2.0,"i had this watch for only a few weeks and the band that secures the excess wristband to your watch broke . it is not a secure band, it is almost stretchy like taffy and snaps easily . the watch design itself is cool, but was not worth the money i spent on it ."
2.0,"Not as represented. Ordered two and one has petals at the bottom of the tulle but the other does not. They are also different shades from one another. The brownish pink color is not as deep as pictured and he petals are more beige peach than pink. The petals are very thin, have no structure, and lay more flat than expected. There are also fewer petals than the fluffy look in the photo would lead you to believe. The petals are poorly finished with exposed ribbons, dangling threads, and some arrived just plain torn. I ordered the mauve and the pink options to check out and I‚Äôve included photos of both. Last but certainly not least is that the Nonna Bambini branding is misleading. These items are not Italian and actually have tags that vary from Mignour brand to Mida Angel to Sha Liu Sha. So even though they all have the Nonna Bambini paper tag on them, the sewing tag indicates different manufacturers. The two stars are simply because the design is adorable so if you luck out and get a perfect specimen, you‚Äôll really like it."
2.0,"I just recently moved to Florida and need to get a whole new wardrobe. So I bought a lot of summer dress that have spaghetti straps, which you need to wear a strapless bra for. So I was very excited to try the Sexy Women's Ultralite Backless Strapless Silicone Push-Up Reusable Bra by Liswic. Sadly, that excitement quickly vanished once I tried the actual bra. First I believe that it was too big. I went off of their size chart for my size and I believe I should have purchased the small/medium not the large/xlarge. Secondly it was extremely hard to remove the plastic from the reusable bra. I kept sticking to the actual bra when I tried to remove the clear plastic cover. Next I couldn‚Äôt get the bra to stay on. The adhesive wasn‚Äôt strong enough and was pulling away from my breast. It created a weird gap. Lastly, removing it was awful. It actually HURTS to pull it away from your skin. I am not a fan at all of the reusable adhesive bra and will go back to the standard strapless bra.<br /><br />I did receive this product at discounted/free price for my review. The views here are entirely mine and based on my own experience. I hope my review was helpful to you."
2.0,"Love everything about this dress, however the bodice felt uncomfortable and the length was about 4 inches to long.  I would have had to have to many alterations to make on the possibility that it would work.  Quality was very good, I‚Äôm sad it didn‚Äôt work for me."
2.0,Cheap looking. It was to be a present
2.0,"This dress isn't for tall women over 5 ""9. I'm  5 '11 and this dress was too short, a little above the ankles."
2.0,The wrap comes undoneeasily
2.0,They don‚Äôt stay in place and during a workout will slide off your head
2.0,"The socks had ribbing on the bottom which are very uncomforable to my feet.  I have very sensitve feet so these did not work for me.  I gave them to my daughter.  Also, the length were not as long as I thought they would be.  The socks did seem to be sturdy, just not for me."
2.0,This has been a Jamaican review
2.0,"Right out of the box, the cuff link button fell out of the silver base. Not a huge deal to glue it back in, but new things shouldn't need fixing before their first use."
2.0,"dont like these the colors are in a word  weird,,and the fits terrible.you can certainly tell these wernt made in the usa,i wont buy again.not happy"
2.0,OK for one time where do not put it in the washer or dryer.
2.0,"This dress was not  flattering at all on me. The top part of the dress was way too big for me, perhaps I'm just not large enough to fill it out. I gave it to stars because I love the colors. I just wish it fit better was also a little short on me. I am 5'6&#34; 128lbs. Although it would make a perfect maternity dress."
2.0,"** Submitted first on 12/31, and then this edit on 1/15**  I originally gave this 5 stars.  However, after only two weeks of intermittent use, they have turned color.  The gold is not gold anymore, now it looks like dirty copper.  I never got them wet.  I didn't even wear them every day.  What a shame.  The original review I did is below.**<br /><br />I ordered these earrings in the ""round"" style, which has tiny leaves on each side of the hoop.  They open by pulling the top of the hoop apart.  It swings open via a tiny, basically invisible hinge at the bottom of the hoop.  The leaves in the front (in the front half, until the hinge at the bottom) all have two small simulated diamonds on each leaf.  The leaves on the back half of the earrings do not have these crystals.  I'm so pleased with the way these earrings look.  They are very beautiful and delicate, and look like real gold."
2.0,"They were really cute, but small, I had to return. These are not the kind that flow through the thighs."
2.0,"It is so small you can not tell what it is unless you already know, and the chain is not 18'"
2.0,It came misshaped and I cannot fix it. Every time I attempt to wear it I look in the mirror abs take it off because the brim looks so bad.
2.0,"Very disappointed in the colors received compared to what was shown.  I may wear them at some point, which is why I didn't take the time to just send them back.  That would even be more of a hassle.<br />."
2.0,Suit has no lining so you can see through it.  Can't imagine what it would look like if it got wet.
2.0,"Too tight across chest, going back"
2.0,"These are not holding up well. Though they don't pill, I have been hand washing them and the elastic is starting to come out of the top. Guess I will try yet another brand next year (or possibly buy the brand I bought last year -- I would have repurchased them this year, but the price had gone up far too much IMO . . . .)"
2.0,"It was ok at best in my opinion. Had to wind it by hand twice, once after only 6 hours og not wearing it. After about 8 months the knob to adjust time and to wind it up fell out."
2.0,"Runs small, and was a lot shorter than pictured."
2.0,"Shirt color isn‚Äôt the shade in the picture, it‚Äôs a very different shade of blue.  I ordered my normal size XL, and honestly my medium sized daughter could wear it comfortably. I‚Äôd have to order a 3X if I wanted to wear it.  I didn‚Äôt catch the part of the description where it said it was stretchy material, which it is and I don‚Äôt care for those types of shirts. Which is sad because it‚Äôs a cute design."
2.0,You pay for what you get. Wasn‚Äôt the best.
2.0,"LOVE the deep blue color, but that's about where my enjoyment stopped.<br /><br />Pros<br />-------<br />Cheap<br />Came with silicon-ish watch cover<br />Color<br />Decent material, feels similar to the real thing<br /><br />Cons<br />-------<br />Band isn't quite as flexible as an Apple band, and had slight gaps the sides of my wrist<br />Belt-stye clasp. Do what I did - tell yourself it's no big deal.....you'll regret it. It's more clunky to quickly strap your watch on now<br />The end of the strap frequently sticks out if/when the little loop thing slides one way or the other, leaving the excess sticking out<br /><br />So - $7? Hard to complain, but after about a week, I've had enough. If this was designed similar to Apple's, where the end of the strap goes *under* the band, it'd be a winner."
2.0,Material is too heavy and I dislike the color...sort of muddy instead of khaki. It's just odd.
2.0,This product does not come as pictured . Mine is all black . Waste of money
2.0,"These sun glasses look very nice. They fold nice and compact and the hard shell case can clip on your belt. The problem is that after less than a month of usage, the nose piece separated from one side. Seems to me, that the noise piece should be redesigned to be made of stronger material. They do block the sun well and fit comfortable on my head."
2.0,Too small to give to my sister who I bought them. I decided to keep them since they fit me. Material was cheap and the seams ripped after washing only a couples times.
2.0,After two years these boots are still better than Timbs. Other than that they can not with stand time. Water starts to seep thru the front and they become uncomfortable to walk in. Stylish is what I would call them. Only walked around in NYC. These boots don't stand up well toward weather and tough terrain.
2.0,I ordered a size up and it was way too small. Especially in the arms.
2.0,"The shirt fit my son just fine, but the pants are way too big! The pants would fit an 8 year old‚ÄîNOT a 5 year old! Very disappointing!"
2.0,"I wear 2 XL in sweaters and 3 XL in coats, because this coat is thin, I decided to order 4 XL to wear thick sweater under. I couldn't even get in the coat wearing t-shirt. It is Chinese sizing."
2.0,poofy
2.0,If you have bigger boobs it‚Äôs not for you
2.0,"Turning my neck black!! Sucks cause I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the necklace!!!"
2.0,"I recieved this product for a free or reduced price in order for my honest review bla bla bla.  I'm sure you're thinking that this is going to be biased, but I promise it's really not.  I've received many products from this place, but I have not liked all of them.  This one I do.<br /><br />I'm in the swim team.  For two hours a day, I swim non-stop, hard.  SO I think I'm the best test subject for this sort of thing.<br /><br />These glasses claim to be fog-proof and it's so true!  I've never had goggles that really did not fog no matter what I did, so that's great.  It also has great UV protection for the eyes which is important because chlorine and sun are really bad for your undereyes, but if you swim outside a lot, this will give you what we call a goggle tan pretty hardcore because no sunlight will get through this.  But still, with some concealer or some fake tan, you'll be fine!<br /><br />Edit: These goggles were good for about a week and now they fog up worse than my regular goggles.  I'll keep them because they're still pretty decent, but they're also sort of difficult to deal with... For this reason, I changed my review from a 5."
2.0,"Me gustar√≠a saber alguna opini√≥n de alguien que haya comprado este vestido, se ve hermoso, pero no se s√≠ realmente lo sea al recibirlo , por favor dejen sus comentarios o algunas fotos"
2.0,Product not made Very well or to last
2.0,"Bought these for retro week at my child's Elementary School ,  his grade was assigned to the 80s . Cute but seam split on first wear. Very thin material."
2.0,"It's not the same as the model, the effect is not very good"
2.0,Was smaller than I expected and the quality was not the same as pictured.
2.0,"fit nice, will do for comfort around the house"
2.0,"doesn't fit my head, and stay on"
2.0,"I worked a 4 hour shift at work and had a hole. Wasn't even on my feet all that much. I'll keep my extra pair to wear around the house. They are SUPER soft and cozy. Unfortunately, for me, they did not hold up for regular wear."
2.0,"The pictures and even the video make this look like a ringer t shirt. The pictures are straight up a different shirt. Instead of rings around the seams, it's made to look like you're wearing a white undershirt that's just slightly longer. People have been asking me if I got this shirt in the early 2000s when that was in style. Shirt is very soft though. I would love to have a shirt with this material that is actually what is shown here"
2.0,"I bought this watch thinking it would be a great watch to wear at the pool or in the ocean when i'm not really diving.  Upon first look, the watch looks great.  Nice weight to it, band is nice.  But the bezel is stationary.  I know that doesn't matter since i'm not planning on diving with it, but it just made me feel like I was wearing costume jewelry.  Also, the sub dials for the Chrono were a little &#34;off&#34; which again, made me feel as though it was a very cheap watch."
2.0,I did not like the texture and the pockets were strange.
2.0,it honestly looks really tacky in person LOL and it‚Äôs thin
2.0,The arm is to tight everything else is big
2.0,"I love this item, but....it arrived with inside packaging torn and the item broken."
2.0,Expected the fabric to be heavier and not so thin.
2.0,Had to give them to somebody else bc they were too small
2.0,They looked cute . But no support at all
2.0,It‚Äôs so boxy and larger then advertised. And to be honest it‚Äôs not really flattering on someone more on the thinner or shorter side because then it loooks like it swallows the person up
2.0,"Just got them and will keep them given the cost of shipping them back.  They look at lot nicer on the picture than they really are.  They're a bit heavy and really look cheap from the back.  If you have long hair, maybe the back doesn't show but with short hair, it'll show.  I know these are inexpensive, but for a couple of extra dollars you can find a more refined set of earnings on sale in any department store."
2.0,"Polo quality was good but shorts were too thin and poor quality, I had expenceted a little more thickness on the shorts"
2.0,I'm a 38D so ordered XL size. Does not fit. Too tight. Material is also itchy.<br /><br />The search continues..
2.0,was falling apart
2.0,Not loving it. The zipper is too hard to get open and it gets really bulky when just one bill is put in. I‚Äôd hate to have it full and attached to my keys
2.0,I don't like the pattern it leaves on my legs. Also the material feels very harsh to the touch.
2.0,This hat looks more purple than gray...
2.0,same as other bad quality jewelry
2.0,To slippery and fall down off my face all the time
2.0,Too small on the face. weird shape.
2.0,"My son has only worn these for going on two weeks and the velcro is already starting to separate.  They are cheap so, I suppose you get what you pay for."
2.0,I love the patterns and they seem to be well made but the are teeny tiny.  I wear a size 9 shoe and there is no way I would be able to get them on.  Sadly I will have to return.
2.0,I like the dress it fits comfortable but the chest area is WAY TOO tight! its and XL. I have to return on sell it so I am not excited about that but overall it is pretty.
2.0,"I bought these couple months ago. Now, that I've had chance to wear them for some time I decided to post the review. The Wedges look very nice, but they are not comfortable at all. I wore them for couple hours and my feet were killing me, to the point that I could not wait to get home and take them off.  I still wore them forcing myself to get used to them. No luck. On top of that after some time the heel cracked, rubber one, can you believe it?! I could not. Total waste of money."
2.0,I bought these for my granddaughter and she only wore them a couple times before choosing any other pair of shoes over these due to the rigidity and weight of these beasts.
2.0,"Cute, but they fall off my feet or I trip in them!  Way too wide and get wider with wear."
2.0,"The fit was fine, however, it was full of lint and had specks of other colors in it instead of a solid charcoal grey that I was expecting."
2.0,"I would be ashamed to have sold this to someone in this condition. There is orange paint on everything, orange paint is chipped, and the thing is filthy, like it‚Äôs been sitting in someone‚Äôs dirty garage. If my child had not asked for this for Christmas, I would be sending it back. Hopefully I can get it cleaned up after he opens it."
2.0,"Way smaller than expected. I wanted these to show up in a resin craft project, but they're just too small to be noticeable shapes. Looks like plain sand."
2.0,"I ordered the stiletto high heel protector however I could not get my heels in the protectors because the opening was way too small.  I have stiletto heels, but they have that plastic tip on the bottom that you walk on, that part was too big for the holes.  I would order the next size up as the ones I have are useless to me."
2.0,It broke the second day I had it
2.0,It was great until it wasn‚Äôt. Last a few months but then broke.
2.0,"Didn't like these at all.  My one year old was slipping everywhere inside the house.  These shoes only come with rubber on the heel and the tip of the shoes leaving the middle of the rest of the shoe with the foam rubber (or whatever they use) throughout.  Had to return them,  They did fit perfectly."
2.0,Cheaply made-metal discolored after use
2.0,"Just a bunch of junky jewelry, i bought thjs mostly for the balls ans some rings but i should have bought a smaller, better quality assortment"
2.0,They came dirty (I thought sterling silver didn't get black)
2.0,NOT TRUE TO SIZE AS CHART STATED. VERY UNHAPPY
2.0,Received 2 items in bad condition. A replacement was sent to me in good time. Appreciated the customer service but don't plan on purchasing again.
2.0,It did fit and work just fine but the finish was terrible. The black was chipped away between the links and the gold was peeling away at the corners.
2.0,"Thin fabric, strange cut. Huge, squared neck hole. Skinny armholes. Don't know how they'll hold up, but the oddly unathletic cut means I won't find out."
2.0,These boots are cute and good quality but they are SO tight. I have thin feet and went a half size up and these were still too tight for me
2.0,"Shirt is very thin material. Neck on the shirt seems to be stretched out and too big around. Also the words at the bottom, ""Come and take it!"", are too far down towards the bottom of the shirt and not easily read or visible when wearing the shirt. The shirt just seems to be too long for my taste and just didn't quite fit right. I guess that's a chance you take & what happens when you buy any clothing without actually trying it on first. I don't think I'll be buying anymore of these shirts because they are too expensive for what you actually get. I like that this company supports our veterans but supporting Law Enforcement (Oath Breakers), that's a deal breaker for me, especially seeing how most of them treat our veterans and how they seem to love to trample & violate our Constitutional Rights (which they took an oath to defend, uphold & protect) every chance they get."
2.0,Not true to size. Runs small. Fabric is very thin. And the light tan stripes are more yellow. Returning.
2.0,"Good looking but the glass started peeling like human skin in winter. I used it for driving purpose, no mishandling is done. Polarizing wise no comment but the peeling make the glass look ugly."
2.0,"Cute suit, but you need a short torso."
2.0,"Basic design is OK, I like the hard clamshell design, but the hook attachment is poorly executed with poor materials. The nylon loop which holds the hook attachment is not rugged enough to stand up to daily use. It quickly becomes frayed and rips in half, letting your case dropp to the ground. I wore mine hanging from the belt loop of my jeans, it did not last long, just a few weeks. Because other reviews indicated this problem, I bought two, hoping one would not do so poorly, both cases failed since I bought the item a couple of months ago.  I am only giving this product two stars as the basic clamshell design is solid, just lacks a good attachment point."
2.0,Do not buy this if you are self conscious about your weight. It fit to size but really draws attention to tor midsection.
2.0,"The design on this shirt is not going to last much longer. Each time I wash and dry it(inside out) the edges curl back a little more. I love the picture, just wish it was higher quality."
2.0,The robe is beautiful however the 3x mens was very very small.  More like a medium.
2.0,Strange cheap feeling material.
2.0,"These seem to be decent gloves, but they run ridiculously small.  I ordered a men's large and they fit me.  I'm a woman with average-sized hands - 7""  (measuring around the hand, across the palm) and my research shows that a men's large should be for 9"" hands."
2.0,"Looks very cheap, feels very cheap and looks like cloth over cardboard. Looks ugly"
2.0,"RETURNED TO THE VENDOR, WHO WAS VERY GRACIOUS ABOUT IT.  I WEAR A &#34;NARROW&#34; AND THERE IS NO WAY THIS COULD BE ADJUSTED TO FIT."
2.0,These snoods are way to tight on my head and don't stay in place.
2.0,It's a pretty watch but arrived not working and now it's too late to return.
2.0,"I didn't see mention in the description that this ring is adjustable. However, that is what I received. The ring in the picture is way better quality than what I was sent. The key ring is pretty good quality and may come in handy. I am reluctant to buy from efuture again."
2.0,Bought this watch for my patient and it stops and goes whenever it wants giving wrong time often I am returning..
2.0,"Product arrived on time but its not what I expected.  The fabric is all rayon with no stretch so it clings to the body. Great if you are built without curves. LOL  The product is made in China according to the bag. The shirt has1 small size tag but no others for cleaning instructions.  According to their size chart I ordered an XL which should have fit fine, wrong.  The fabric clung to every curve & ruffle.  Even my hubby said sent it back.  The only positive note, they blue, teal & white are beautiful & bright."
2.0,Decent. But very very small and has that adjustable ring you find in a Cracker Jack box feel to it.
2.0,Ordered 28 inseam but got a 30 instead.
2.0,"This sweater runs two sizes small and it does not have full length sleeves, they are 3/4 instead."
2.0,Too small. Sizing runs very small
2.0,"I guess these are masks like any other and would work in a pinch. My issue with them is that the fabric is just a square with no gathering or anything else to make the mask fit around the face so there‚Äôs just a ton of material that flaps about below the ears, chin and jawline. That makes it look a bit ridiculous but unless I have the ear straps crazy tight it also doesn‚Äôt stay on well. I could sew it together to fix but that sort of defeats the purpose."
2.0,Weird material makes the shirt kinda stiff
2.0,"Very awkward fit, small for a size 12. Definitely need two people to put on the dress. There is no zipper on the back, just saches  you have to crisscross in order to close the back of the dress along with trying to keep the flap in. I returned it the same day as received. Refund was not processed in a timely manner after being received. I had to inquire about it after almost ten days. Only nice thing about it was the royal blue color.  Dress was very wrinkled. Came packaged in a small plastic bag. Buyer beware that if it‚Äôs returned, shipping charges are not refunded and they also charge a stocking fee which they don‚Äôt disclose.<br />Waste of money."
2.0,"The shirt absolutely is NOT the one in the pic. It's one similar! It's not as long, it's tiny. I'm 5""8' 166lbs and got an XXL and it's not at all loose! The red is more orange red than the blue red in the pic. It is thin, but not a thin cotton knit/jersey. It's an artifical fiber. The top buttom hits just below my bra in the front, so it can't be worn alone, but it's already more snug than I'd like. The hem comes just to the bottom of the belt loops on med rise jeans that come to Mt belly button, so its about an inch or so below your belly button! It's a lot more like a cropped hoodie IMHO. It went back in the 0ackage as soon as I checked out a few things to convey to my fellow Amazon shopping sisters looking for low priced, cute knock around in clothes! &lt;wink>"
2.0,These stretch out  and get baggy when I wear them.  Initially they look good.  After a few hours they are baggy.
2.0,"I was so excited when I got the earrings because they were so cute. Put them in, and TWO days later the crystal fell out of one of my earrings. Now I‚Äôm not so excited anymore."
2.0,"More like leggings than joggers, if that's what you're looking for. I returned because I was looking for a looser pant."
2.0,These are super cute. They turned my daughter's thumb blue..
2.0,The quality of the charm is good. But the quote was black like moisture had gotten on it.
2.0,Bag looks great but came with a small tear in the front of the bag. My daughter loves it and it was 2 days before school so I didn't bother to return.
2.0,"The underwear is nice, it doesn't ride up at all. They are tight around the thighs. But as come back home I find myself just wanting to take them off and go for a cotton pair rather than this. Also, the underwear itself is starting to fall apart, not enough to warrant a new pair, but enough to know that the material isn't the best."
2.0,Was very disappointed. It would have fit someone in the jrs dept size medium and I ordered Xlg. Thank goodness I have a daughter that can wear it but I was really looking forward to getting it now I am afraid to order anymore tops
2.0,"Didn't last long, broke after a week of use."
2.0,ITS NOT THE SAME THAN THE POSTED. ITS THINER AND SMALLER.<br />EXPENSIVE FOR ITS SIZE
2.0,These earrings are a little too small.  The bar is way to thin;  I feel like they are going to break quickly.  I put them on once and they are already misshapen.  They might be better for a child.
2.0,"This case is for the iPhone not the iPad.  It doesn't fit an HTC Sensation and the snap is hard to close, even when empty.  Otherwise, cute!"
2.0,Material was not what I expected from viewing the picture.
2.0,Does not look anything like the photo. Material is cheap.
2.0,The top of it is good but the bottom of the top is wayyyyyy to tight
2.0,Cute as a swimsuit cover up but nothing else. Lots of frays. It'll work. I doubt this thing would last 2 washes in the machine.
2.0,This shirt was not very flattering. It was very wide cut which is understanding because it supposed to hang but it was too wide and too short in front. Material is soft but very thick.
2.0,"Vest is a bit bulky to wear. Heating elements work but vest is made of a foam material that does not allow heat to radiate well.<br />The vest functions, but I would not buy again and would have returned it had I figure this out in time."
2.0,"SOFT???? Cashmere??? Not like any excuse for cashmere I've ever felt. That being said, the sparkle is nicely done. I just don;t know if I can stand the harsh, itchy material even through the dress fabric, never mind on my bare skin! Ugh! ITCHY! ITCHY! ITCHY!!! NOT SOFT at all. I might try lining it with materials on hand to make the inside NOT touch my skin so I can use it. Meanwhile, the sparkle makes it a contender for cutting up and making X-Mas decorations."
2.0,"I bought these because of the ease of putting on goggles with a back fastener, which works well.<br />Unfortuately, the nose piece, which connects the lenses, is hard plastic and vertical with no form for the nose. The bottom digs into my nose, uncomfortable, left a deep impression and makes the goggles not wearable for me."
2.0,"Tuve que ajustarla a la llegada , malo el material esta llena de hoyos, pero aun es mi favorita XDXD"
2.0,These are super cute however they are pretty heavy.  I don't really like heavy earrings so I'm going to return these.
2.0,If you're small/petite this will fit you.... Definitely not for someone whose curvy.
2.0,Material super thin not even Jean material I ordered button fly got a cheap zipper
2.0,"These masks fit like a sheet on paper on the face, there is no contour hugging for the nose or chin so it sits flat and ridgid. In inside lining is already rough and pilling so it's scratchy against my lips. The colors are also very washed out in comparison to the photos the seller provided. I would recommend these to anyone.<br />I will include a photo for proof."
2.0,Don‚Äôt fit very good
2.0,"The print is done nicely, however the seams were already fraying along the sides and definitely has that typical cheaper costume quality.<br /><br />I did order a size bigger than I normally wear and it fit perfectly like my usual size, so I would suggest size up.<br /><br />Something else to be aware of, is that I thought I was buying a onesie made from warm sweatshirt  material and instead this is more like a thin t-shirt/costume material, not what I was looking for. Hopefully this review will clarify that for others. But if it had been well made I would have been okay with thinness."
2.0,In the picture the wings look big. But they are small. Not too comfortable for my 11 years old girl to wear. Bad quality. My girl wore it for 2 minutes and a feather came off.
2.0,Sizing is off. I ordered a size bigger just to make sure it was loose and it was super small
2.0,Material looks like poor quality... kind of small in length
2.0,NOT FR AT ALL. First time used its covered in burn holes. Not made for a welders lifestyle.
2.0,ordered medium but size on tag says 30-32.
2.0,its ok just not as comfortable as i thought it would be
2.0,"Bought for a child and was a bit too big, unweildy"
2.0,This is to be a womens xxlg and if fit like a women‚Äôs medium. Way to small.
2.0,My small little white pill did not fit... maybe this for a powder formula.
2.0,"Liked:<br />Accordion stretch panels from waist to shoulder helped with maneuverability<br />Metal knee, elbow, and shoulder plate looked very nice<br />Replaceable knee and elbow sliders<br /><br />Disliked:<br />The seams could have been improved. What bothered me most was the thread ends were hardened and would rub against my skin. They are especially noticeable around the ankle and wrist.<br />The inner lining was made of a thin mesh fabric that also caused irritation. It was not comfortable. I could only see someone wearing this if they had a full undersuit. This loose mesh lining also made it difficult to put my legs through the suit since my feet would get stuck on it.<br />The armor only emphasized the discomfort. The pieces did not form to the body very well. This isn't a huge problem, but then it should have adequate padding underneath so that I wouldn't feel plastic edges poking me with every movement.<br />The back hump also did not form to my back very well. When I was in a tucked position, the bottom end would protrude such that it pulled the leather up, away from my back rather than conforming to the spine.<br />The metal plating on the shoulder, elbow, and knee had rust underneath before I even wore it.<br />I'm 5'6"" and the small size was very big on me. This suit was built for wider people rather than a slim fit.<br />Keep in mind that most armors are useless if they do not sit close to your body. If you push them with one hand and they move around easily, they won't do much in a crash."
2.0,"Very cheap and chintzy feeling. Clearly for $25 I wasn't expecting high quality, but this feels like a plastic toy."
2.0,Not a flattering cut at all. Not at all what I expected.
2.0,Cheap. Flimsy.  Tyne on buckle falls through buckle. No stretch.  My money should be refunded!  Had to reuse my old band!!!
2.0,"Not as pictured.  Although it is maked silver the ring is not polished as in the picture, it has dull finish somewhere between silver and bronze that does not polish with silver cleaner/polish.  The design & fit are nice but I  am returning because I was expecting a polished silver ring."
2.0,Shrank so bad after the first wash without being dried in a dryer. It shrank at least 3 sizes..on the upside my friends kid got a new shirt.
2.0,First off I will say the shipping was super fast and I appreciated that.<br />the product was more like a plastic toy you could buy at walgreens.<br />I would not have expected more out of the item if it was a price that matched to the products quality.<br />I would not have ordered this item if I knew how cheaply it was made.
2.0,The shape is weird and the material was itchy. I sent it back.
2.0,No clasp on Necklace
2.0,"These run SUPER small, so make sure you size up. I am 5‚Äô10 and wear a size 4/6 - I got a medium and they‚Äôre so small I can‚Äôt wear them. Size up!"
2.0,"It was a darker green than I expected from the pictures. You definitely need a full bust to pull it off, and it will need ironing. The design just wasn't for me, so I returned."
2.0,"I ordered 2 colors. This skirt is pretty. The elastic waist it cheap and looks like it was sown by a child on a toy machine, and it runs around 6 sizes smaller. I thought they had sent me the wrong size, so I checked the label. No, the tag showed the size I ordered. I wouldn't order again."
2.0,"After reading some of the reviews, I thought this calf compression sleeve would be a little tight.  People say they have 17&#34; calves and they fit.  However, I have a little over 18&#34; and they don't fit.  I could barely get it over my foot.  I had to have my spouse pull it off.  They are cute, but just the wrong size.  14+&#34;  is wrong and they should change the descriptions to what they would actually fit."
2.0,"I love it. But, it was too tight. I have to get one size bigger."
2.0,"The leather and quality of this bracelet seemed good for the price, but the clasp is just not secure enough for my lifestyle therefor only giving 2 stars.  The clasp opens and closes by twisting the ends slightly so it just does not stay secure when closed.  I am returning it for this reason."
2.0,Measurements not accurate
2.0,"The fabric of this skirt is very thick and heavy. The skirt is also somewhat larger and is not that flattering. The string tie part is thick fabric so when you tie it, it looks very odd!"
2.0,it's way smaller than i expected :((((( but it's cute
2.0,"I was really excited to get this jacket; I ordered it in three colors since the colors looked so pretty and the jacket was adorable in photos. , Unfortunately, it took more than a month to receive and when I finally got it the color wasn‚Äôt the neon pink I‚Äôd expected like in the photo. I‚Äôm returning it after all the wait and anticipation. (Returning the other two as well)"
2.0,"It's pretty awesome until you get to the back, where in huge letters it says HATE. No love to balance it, just huge HATE."
2.0,they are silky and the fabric clings to you so every bump shows. not impressed didnt like them i sent them back. hate them
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt look anything like picture. The color is off and it‚Äôs oddly shaped. Funny bill
2.0,I like them the only thing is they are dull
2.0,Straps were too loose and I was consistently making contact between my heel and the ground - the bottom of the shoe kept moving outwards as I walked
2.0,"Did not read well enough to realize the writing is on the back, pretty disappointed"
2.0,Cap was way too small. It was more like a childs cap.
2.0,I bought these and the first day my daughter wore the outfit the iron on vinyl came off!
2.0,This product had a hole between the fingers in one of the gloves and the crotch of the suit. Luckily I have someone who can sew it up. I wouldn‚Äôt have even given two stars but my son loves it so that counts for something.
2.0,not what I expected. advertised not the same
2.0,"When I first got these shorts out of the package I thought they would do a fine job. Put them on for my morning run and found they fit well. Unzipped the right side pocket to put my phone in and it fell through onto the floor ‚Äì the bottom of the pocket was open. Put the phone in the left pocket and found it worked as intended. Not as comfortable as shorts with the phone pocket centered in the back but adequate. When I went out for my run I discovered the mesh liner was not even on both sides. I'm not sure who Dr Cyril is or was, but should not have put his name on these shorts.  These are adequate for hanging out (!) at home on hot days or perhaps in our private pool but I will not be wearing them out for jogging again."
2.0,"I actually love this bat barrette. I wanted it for Halloween and I also love bats. When I received the item I was really impressed with the quality of the bat itself. However, when I went to put it in my hair, the back of the clasp immediately came off! I got it back in the little holes and tried again being careful not to use too much hair but it still kept falling off. The metal the actual hair clip part is made of is very pliant and the part of the clip that moves doesn't stay in. Where it fits into is extremely easily bent that it won't stay tightened enough for the other part to stay in place. Amazon did refund for the item but I can't recommend a $20 barrette if it can't even be worn due to a cheap, flimsy clip."
2.0,"Looks beautiful, well made and nice fabric. Got a large and fit okay everywhere but the arms. Way too tight and no stretch!! So sad that I have to return it."
2.0,Size is confusing there supposed to fit both men and women but when I ordered what should have been my size they ended up too long. Unsure now which size to order
2.0,"I absolutely loved this shirt. Fit perfectly and looked great, but then I actually wore it for the first time.<br /><br />BOTH armpits ripped over the course of the night. Until then, I had plenty of compliments. I'm only 5'10 and 165 lbs mind you... I wasn't some linebacker trying to cram into a slim fit dress shirt. I have plenty of similar, better quality shirts from name brands that have held up fine over many more uses.<br /><br />Unless I go to an 80s themed party, this shirt is useless. Cheapest material ever. Only buy if you expect 1-2 wears."
2.0,"The sweatshirt runs a little small, but the material is very warm and comfy. The graphic design on it feels like a plastic sheet and I feel like it will start to peel or crack after a few washes."
2.0,"Material is very thin and color had a very yellowish tint, not as in picture"
2.0,Cheap fabric. Too light. Won't Likely stand up to wash. Sizing is off. I'm a M But needed an XL for a proper fit. Not worth the money.
2.0,The dress I could not unzip at all but does work over my head!!! I am overweight but does fit!!! The arms are tight!!! Overall not flattering for an healthy girl!!!
2.0,This bra wasn't made in the USA and so it was 3 sizes too small.
2.0,"Cute, but these are not american sizes..."
2.0,It was to loose for my face. Otherwise it is a cute pair of sunglasses.
2.0,"Reveals way to much, no good coverage."
2.0,"The cuffs on this are really tight, my daughter hates it :("
2.0,I have small feet and wear a size 6 shoe and these socks are so tiny they stretch to capacity while worn. They even make my toes curl and cause discomfort
2.0,The dress is very badly made and the fabric is cheap. The picture is misleading as the actual fabric is not at all flowing or soft. What you get is a plastic-like frock.
2.0,2x more like medium small
2.0,Big warning - the tail is not printed on the back as pictured but is printed on the front.  My 4 year old still liked it but it does raise some interesting questions from other kids on why his shirt is on backwards.
2.0,"I love the sparkle, but I keep losing them as they don't  stay on my Crocs."
2.0,Difficult to close after inserting same items in my old 4-fold wallet.
2.0,"After 2 weeks, the hole stretched too far for the watch to be comfortable."
2.0,Way bigger thab expected
2.0,tight on the head and they break easily!! dont waste your money
2.0,It was too tight which made it uncomfortable. I bought according to sizing chart.
2.0,Not comfortable as well as too small.  Probably the fabric composition. I have been very satisfied with previous orders.  Company was very responsive when I identified a problem.
2.0,These showed up shattered.
2.0,Was nice watch.  Came with plastic tab so battery wasn‚Äôt running.  Battery only last 6 1/2 months.  Battery too much money to replace.
2.0,"It's a pretty dress, the fabric is nice, but it was very cheaply sewn. I returned it."
2.0,My heal is not supported
2.0,"Cheap, you get what you pay for. The ""fabric"" makes me itchy"
2.0,Not my taste. I returned.
2.0,They fit weird in the stomach area and are too short.
2.0,No air flow. Not a good mask to keep you safe but it looks nice
2.0,Fits very small but not a bad dress.
2.0,Very thin material. Grey front/black back looked awkward in the crotch and fit almost as tight as leggings.
2.0,Turned color too quickly!
2.0,The fabric is not comfortable. They are kind of stiff. The screen printed design is thick and rough. The fit is a little snug. The color is a dingy blue. I don‚Äôt recommend these.
2.0,"This looks of high quality in the photo, but in person, the fabric is so thin and shapeless. The belt isn't even attached, so you have to figured out how to make work."
2.0,I‚Äôm usually a small but I ordered up just to make sure it could fit. Lol. Boy was I wrong. The MEDIUM top was TOO small and the bottoms were baggy. Basically the top for almost like an extra small and the shorts fit like a large. If I raise my arm and dance I definitely would be flashing everyone. Just beware of this when ordering.
2.0,The tutu had an odd odor to it that made the whole room stink. It's good quality but it just wasn't what i expected. The smell was pretty terrible. I literally febreezed it multiple times and it still smells.
2.0,Pajamas shrunk significantly after washing and were much to small to wear.
2.0,"It's hard to type in these gloves. Also, my hands get cold. So basically don't bother, find some fingerless, warm cotton gloves if you want to type on your phone."
2.0,"The pattern is beautiful but the fit is completely wonky. Sleeves are too long and very narrow, chest is too small; waist a few inches too wide, neckline too large. It looks like a homemade item and not in a good way. The material is very thin; it appears a knit fabric in the picture but is actually a thin cotton."
2.0,The quality of product was fine but I received pink pair. I ordered black.
2.0,I really wanted to love these boots and I did when I first got them and tried them on. However I wore them for the first time this weekend and the metal piece on the laces on the back already fell off. Very disappointing.
2.0,"I was disappointed with how thin the fabric was and how big the shirt was on me. I ordered a small and I‚Äôm 34x27x36 and an A cup. I would not recommend for small women.<br /><br />As a side note, this shirt arrived very wrinkled and with the sleeves inside out...as if someone had tried it on and then shoved it back in the bag."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but when it arrived, the two ropes on the outside are so loose, it looks pretty bad when worn.  Probably won't be wearing this."
2.0,Very disappointing product.
2.0,‚ÄúFits weird‚Äù Is how my teenage daughter put it.  Bought it In hopes that it would work for her high school homecoming. It fits more like a dress for a more mature woman. However as a more mature woman I love the fabric!  The softness and the stretch We‚Äôre perfect.  Just too long in the waist for your average teen.
2.0,Belt doesn‚Äôt stay shut and it slides down . The medium size 8 to 10 is soo small
2.0,Super excited to get this ring. It‚Äôs about half the size it was said to be. The band is metal but the actual ring and underneath the ring is plastic. Super bummed. Not worth $30.
2.0,Fit was disproportionate...pockets don‚Äôt stay inside but they keep flaring outward
2.0,"Loved the design,the bag and box it came in.<br />Both arms broke off within days of minimal use."
2.0,"Was expecting Twill, but the hat feels like paper. And then bill of the hat is a little shorter than regular hats. Would look good on kids, not teens/adults. 2 stars because of the fast delivery and price."
2.0,So tiny. Really for children. Picture is blown up. The discs are smaller than eraser on a pencil.
2.0,The fur around the top does not match. It looks like two different boots. Would like to return them<br />Nancy Landry<br />landry1040@aol.com
2.0,They are nice looking and seem to be good quality... But after wearing them for an hour I spent the rest of the day pulling them up. I haven't worn them since. It was like they just kept getting bigger and bigger on me.
2.0,I got this shirt and ordered a XXL and it fit like a L. Just make sure you size wayyyyy up.
2.0,Need more real connection to the part of the bracelet.
2.0,"Way too feminine to be for men. Just doesn't work for guys. Unfortunately, I gave it as a gift (that's what I bought it for) so I'm embarrassed now and can't return it."
2.0,"Returned this track suit. The inside fabric was uncomfortable and scratchy, the velour was mediocre, and the drawstring was a hideous white and was an eyesore. Came in a plastic zip bag, all made in China and synthetic materials. I usually wear a medium, and purchased a medium and it was too big.<br />Honestly save an extra 20$ and buy a nicer track suit. This is a no from me. üëé"
2.0,Very pretty but came broken. Had to superglue the post back to the gem.
2.0,After a short time the loop end broke off and I had to have it repaired.  I do like it though.
2.0,"Very very cute but the chain broke after wearing it for like 5 days. So you get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,"It is too tight around the belly area for me, other than that it‚Äôs a pretty color and a great length for me. I lost 51 lbs and with this brand I always need to order up. I ordered a 3x, when I wear a lg-xlg in some name brands. The sizing from this company is never consistent. The styles and fabrics are so pretty, but it‚Äôs not worth my time to order & return anymore."
2.0,Washed this once before wearing it. Wore it twice and just found this hole as shown in the picture. Not happy.
2.0,"It was very cute but the first time I put it on her, one of the ribbons at the neck that ties it together fell off as if it was never sewn on.  I have returned it."
2.0,Cute outfits but the material is very thin.  I purchased 3 sets and unfortunately the sizes are not marked on the package or on the clothing.
2.0,The arms didn't bend/function well.
2.0,I like the color and design but they sent size 7 and not 6
2.0,"These are nice looking jeans and flattering if they were not so long they are very long I am 5ft 1 inch and these were to long to wear and I had to return them the waist, butt and thigh area all fit as expected just the length"
2.0,Title says it all ' Fit is EXTREMELY SMALL'<br />Won't even fit arm let aong my leg. I like fabric and style. Wished it dod fit adult
2.0,Would have been nice if I could put them on.  The size chart is not correct and they were way smaller than I expected.  Returned.
2.0,It was too cheap looking.
2.0,These fit as expected but they do fall down inside of the shoe.  I would not recommend based on that.
2.0,Poor quality. Received item smashed and had to bend earrings back into place. Earrings are not even.
2.0,The hanging rope was missing from the order which was the main reason i ordered these particular hats-because the rope was included.
2.0,The material is weird and a lot like a swimsuit. It is way too stretchy and has no shape to it. Not a fan and will be returning. I ordered a small and I am 4'9&#34; 115 lbs
2.0,I liked the style but it fit every where good but arm was too tight.
2.0,"Un regalo para mi nieta de 12  a√±os  viene demasiado chico, y la tela no estira nada"
2.0,My dress came with a ripped side seam and will be returned for a refund.
2.0,I like form fitting stretch but this is baggy still.
2.0,"Its cute but Very thin material, fragile :("
2.0,I loved the utility of this purse to carry my phone but unfortunately it started to come apart after 3 months of use.
2.0,"Beautiful bag, however,  it's advertised  for a 15 in laptop and it does not easily  fit a 15&#34; laptop.  Will keep it as a bag, but will have to shop for the much needed fashion forward laptop bag."
2.0,There was no zipper pull when it was arrived. It seems I cannot return it or replace it.
2.0,These masks are lightweight and the colors are as describe but they are not for someone with small face like me.
2.0,This is very short in the back and smaller than size than a medium. Luckily it is for my daughter and I am hoping it fits in the back since she is shorter but an average adult it is short in the back. Very thin too
2.0,"I purchased the solid purple masks that have the nasal area reinforcement. I masks that I received are just like the cheap standard blue masks that I could have purchased at the Dollar Store. I was excited to order a disposable mask that looked more like the pictures, and not cheap looking. I wanted to love them, unfortunately, it's just not what I ordered. I've attached a picture of what I received, and what I was supposed to get."
2.0,"Really poor quality ties, even for the price. Cute images though."
2.0,"Really for me a little to small,,would have been really nice,if only larger"
2.0,I used them @ work( line cook ). Inretrospec They probably would have worked fine in a social setting. But I need a work boot reasonably priced.  Live & learn.
2.0,They are somewhat comfortable but the dye in the material is coming off onto my feet. So whatever they used to make the sandal is crap! Will not buy again from them.
2.0,Clasp to weak. That's why I return it.
2.0,"Product arrived incomplete, there was not a battery pack. The instructions were not in ""English""."
2.0,"This dress is beautifully made and is really pretty, but it is sized wrong. The dress runs 1 size too small....at least."
2.0,"It got the job done, barely. But the main problem with this is that once folded and in ""cary mode"" the suit is upside down in the bag. A proper design would have the fold of the suit at the top so ti doesn't bunch up."
2.0,Emmmmm. See attached picture. The quality needs to be improved and controlled.
2.0,Pants are at a good price but the picture and description is not what you get. The spots was not hot pink but red.
2.0,Runs EXTREMELY small. I'm a XXL at Target & bought  a 3X of this & it fit like a Target Medium (trying to pick a brand to reference that most use)
2.0,Used everyday for my keys so I could find them easily. The threading started coming apart within a week of using it. But is still really cute.
2.0,I think it's a case of the picture being prettier than the actual item. Parts of the necklace looked scratched and pitted. The gems look almost plastic like. If they are crystals they are low end. Mine were scratched.  But up close this item is unimpressive.  Great for the kids dress up or Halloween costume.
2.0,Cheap tiny sequins all over.  Fit weird big through waist and short.  I am shortwaisted.
2.0,"Pretty little earrings for a great price, however, earrings come in a plastic bag inside a padded envelope.  Great, except that the posts stick through the padded envelope and are totally bent down by the time they arrive in your mailbox."
2.0,Sizing doesn‚Äôt fit me!
2.0,I bought this for my husband. Really disappointed it was too small. It‚Äôs not one size fits all!  I keep it for myself.  My husband is 6‚Äô2.
2.0,"The quality is ok for causal affairs for an adult, or perhaps for a teenager. Please keep in mind, the tie is very narrow."
2.0,"My wife didnt like it as a shirt for anything but bed time. It was ment to be an under shirt for work to wear with cute cover shoulder things, but it was too small and goes sheer in the light, also rides up on smooth bras ."
2.0,Iteam broke quickly after purchase
2.0,bag is good quality. but have no cross body strap.
2.0,He bag is smaller than I thought it would be. It does not look a messenger style bad as described. And the color is way more pink than red. I might give it to my niece.
2.0,The loop for the top part is way to small for an adult ear.It is too top heavy and will not stay on
2.0,"The bottom of the shoe is like their flip flops. It is better to size down but, if you have wide feet like I do do not buy this model at all."
2.0,It was too flowy for my taste. It made me feel like I was wearing a moo-moo.
2.0,Ended up returning it before even trying it on.
2.0,Had giant ugly black buttons ruining soft look of jacket
2.0,"The material was very thin, too small and I ordered big just in case. Doesn‚Äôt fit like the photo, the cut is more straight across than high low and where it comes together in the middle is straight like a regular sweater as opposed to flowy like the pic. I was pretty disappointed."
2.0,"The material was not comfortable or stretchy like you might imagine and did not fit snug to the body like the leotard style should. It stretched up the back rather than making you look curvy like the photo and gave a horrible weggie. The collar piece around the neck was uncomfortable and tight. I ordered my size, and it was too small. The white straps all over the costume were not adjustable like you‚Äôd think. They were sewn to one set length, and they were extremely loose. So the leotard was too small, and the straps were hilariously loose. If I wanted them to fit like the images suggest, I‚Äôd have to cut them and re-sew them myself. Overall, very poor quality and I was very disappointed. Returned immediately."
2.0,Very bulky material. It doesn't lay like the picture.
2.0,Cute ring for the price but not a penny more. Cheaply made. Visible seams in the metal and came to me bent.
2.0,One of the opals fell out after a month.
2.0,"Runs way way small...must be Chinese sizes. Returning, will not reorder."
2.0,Size was way off! Too small
2.0,It is tiny. Not happy with the size. Looks very cheap and made in China.
2.0,"This thing is enormous. If you‚Äôre smaller, even the small will fall down. There is no way to make it work without safety pins or sewing it smaller. Bummer. If you‚Äôre crafty enough it‚Äôs worth the price to give it a go."
2.0,Palm ripped seam ripped in the first week.  Other than that I like them....
2.0,The bracelet snapped the first day! Beads everywhere
2.0,"I bought two pairs of these, neither is cashmere. Both are scratchy wool. Stick with just buying acrylic so you won't be disappointed."
2.0,Made of very flimsy material had to return unfortunately
2.0,"These earrings are pretty but quite large. They're really too big for me.  If you like large earrings, these are for you but If you want something more demure don't get these."
2.0,Bought 3 pair and the arms came off all of them
2.0,i ordered teal and the color was super dark kinda like a dark green instead of teal... mess my whole outfit up
2.0,ONE WASH AND THE COLOR FADES AND RUNS ;(
2.0,Plastic molds fell out right away.
2.0,"I liked the shape and size of these earrings but the pearls looked only ""ok"", and despite me pinching them to fit snug in my ear they still fell out the first night I wore them.  I have had $3 earrings last longer than these."
2.0,"Cheaply made, thin fabric, won't last after a few washes. Not worth price"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but the material felt cheap and stiff. It felt like the whole dress would disintegrate or become severely misshapen after a couple of washes.<br />As for the dress, it fit more like a bodycon dress than what is shown on the model. Perhaps going a side up would have been the solution for the fit.<br />Ultimately the fabric feel was the deal killer and I returned the dress."
2.0,"The shape, the look and the fit is excellent; however, the clarity is not so great. The lenses  are too dark so it makes my eyes strained and tired. Moreover,  I expected the lenses were blue because the coating is REVO Blue Mirror, but it actually is in dark amber!"
2.0,"This is a good sun sleeve in that it is cool, lightweight, and protects from the sun. Unfortunately, the sewing is very poor and the cuff just unravels constantly."
2.0,"it wasn‚Äôt my favorite, it was too small for being a large, and it just felt uncomfortable on my body type. couldn‚Äôt imagine anyone else getting this with a larger chest because i have a smaller chest size and it was SQUEEZING. overall don‚Äôt recommend"
2.0,"These are really cute first out of the bag, but they're cheaply made and tend to fall apart after the first or second wearing. If you're buying for a specific event, they would work fine."
2.0,Too small and had a 12&#34; section of the side seam that the sewing machine missed.  I had to return it.
2.0,"Cute pants with cute fabric, just ran extremely small."
2.0,Shrunk so much after first wash.  Too small now.
2.0,I regret buying this lens because it's too bright and fogs up easily.
2.0,"Update: I've been buying these for years, but noticed the quality has gone down a lot!! I just bought some barely two months ago, and there are holes already!! Not sure what happened with the quality, but not happy at all!!!<br /><br />Love these shorts for bumming around the house. Comfortable and nice long length!"
2.0,Not what I expected<br /><br />This material also runs like pantyhose!
2.0,"The design is beautiful, but the clip to the nose broke day 2. Mask is useless now :("
2.0,"Returned it after wearing maybe 3 times, the nose clip came out on one side, tucked it back in and it would never stay , poor craftsmanship and made in China!  Yea, serves me right for not purchasing USA. Don't waste your money"
2.0,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and returning it as soon as I can.<br />While the fabric is nice (think of the seamless texture that VS and other companies are selling now) the sizing was just too awkward for my body.<br />I'm 5'4&#34; and 125lb and usually wear size 2/4 (or 25/26&#34; in pants) and am a 34C.<br />I ordered a small.<br />The bottoms were too tight (as in they cut in to my hips awkwardly) and the top was too big. I would have considered ordering a size up, but the top has no adjustable straps and therefore the big top problem would only be worse.<br />Maybe would work if you had less of an hourglass figure and a more athletic build, but I would not recommend this for anyone else with my same body type/dimensions."
2.0,Came in the wrong size should‚Äôve been a large Nana Exter large
2.0,Turned fast bu only $2 good for the night looked pretty with my dress. One time wear for me? The price is rifgt
2.0,Very cute shoes but much too wide for my 5 and 7 year old.
2.0,Love the color but size too small
2.0,"I bought this band because they stated it was leather! This is a misrepresentation! This one is a silicone plastic type, it is more stiff & makes my wrist sweat! I do love the color & thinner style."
2.0,Much smaller than I wanted.
2.0,Not as expected but it‚Äôs  ok
2.0,"I ordered the black Santa shirt with red plaid pants. My 5 year old is on the smaller side and typically fits comfortably in 5t, but these were way too small. The leggings have no give to them, so she can barely walk."
2.0,Runs small!! The lining is rough! A complete disappointment.
2.0,Quality looks poor. The picture printing behind and printing quality is poor
2.0,the silver on look cheap and I received 2 gold not rose gold and gold
2.0,"Beachsissi Women Patchwork Cross Front Stripe Printed Bathing Suits Open Back Halter Neck Retro One<br />Size Large - The suite fits but the cut of the suit is off.<br /><br />When I saw this suit, I thought perfect - great for the community pool - not quite a ""mom"" suit but one that would have a bit of coverage AND look sexy! I loved this suit. In fact, I still love this suit if only I was a seamstress or knew one!<br /><br />Here's the problem - the bottom fits great but the cut of the top is funny. It wouldn't matter if you had small or large breasts - there is just too much fabric on the sides. It is like it needs darts or the fabric should have been sewn on an angle at the waist area so it would be tight enough on the sides to hold the girls in! If you are a side carrier - lots of space down the breast bone - you really run a risk of the girls not staying in place! I'm going to try to salvage it - when/if I do, I will post another picture! So cute and such hope, but I can't wear it the way it is now! 2 Stars - well made and great concept! The black and white makes me think of suits from the 50s! Super retro!"
2.0,"I understand that each jade piece is unique and not necessarily as pictured and don‚Äôt expect them to be, but I expect the color to be close to the color shown in the picture.  With such a low price, I didn‚Äôt expect high quality but hope to at least get a decent one out of the two I bought.  However the bangles I received are nothing close to the color shown in the picture that I feel like it‚Äôs is outright deceiving.  The bangles are huge, colorless.  They are so thick and heavy that it hurts when the bangle hits my bone when I lower my arm.  One is polished/shiny on the outside, but the inner side is dull like my kitchen backsplash stone.  The second one is dull all over.  I should have paid attention to the ‚Äúhand cutting‚Äù description.  Do not waste your money.  Other than that, good packaging and delivery before the estimate date."
2.0,"This necklace is very cute, but not well made. The shorter necklace ended up wrapping around the back of my hair and getting stuck. Had to untangle it at the restaurant and take it off. Wore the coin necklace and loved it! It broke the first day I wore it unfortunately though."
2.0,It does NOT come with the pony tail as shown. I was hoping to give the appearance of long blonde hair.
2.0,"Gorgeous pattern, lovely for the price, but beware that the fit is not what others have described.<br />If you're a curvaceous woman, sized 14/16, it will be too tight to get on and off around the waist and hips.<br />It appears to be larger than it is due to the stitching along the sides, which can't really be seen in the pictures.<br />I ended up giving it to a friend's daughter who's a size small, and it looked stunning on her and fit perfectly."
2.0,"I needed a stretch belt for some dresses and ordered 3 colors of this belt.  It is very cheap looking.  And runs very small.<br />Debated about keeping them because they didn't cost much, but back they went.  The Ol' get what you pay for.<br />I do not recommend."
2.0,"I was so disappointed as it‚Äôs such a cute style. . The top of the slit poked straight out instead of laying flat- despite being too big. Limp, lifeless fabric."
2.0,"Terrible fit, I got a size up and it was still about three sizes too small"
2.0,"These pants are way too small.  I even followed all the comments and ordered a size up.  I ordered an XL and still too tight, couldn't get them up over my butt all the way.  These pants are made for tiny stick people.  If u have any type of butt at all these will be too small for you.  If u have a flat butt like the model pictured, they'll probably fit u but you will still need to order a size up.  I usually would wear a large. The XL is too small... I'm wondering if even XXL would fit me.  I just returned them. Sorta of a shame they look like cool pants except also for the ties they have on the back pockets. Who's gonna tie their back pockets closed? and behind themselves??  Bad idea there.  Until they can be sized appropriately they will continue to have many many returns."
2.0,"The shirt was really pretty, but it didn't t come any where close to fitting me. The sizes are not advertised correctly. I have to give the shirts to my grand daughter or wait over a month for a refund. It takes to long to get the orders."
2.0,"Got it today.  Cute watch, but it's not working."
2.0,"it wasn't worth the money i paid, the stitching was bad, and i have yet to wear the hat."
2.0,Just too tight. Good for children probably
2.0,"Whatever metal it was. It made my nose sensitive and the bar /hinge turned black, removed the piece and sadly had to toss it into  the trash"
2.0,"I was hoping this would help keep the mask from rubbing on my mouth and make it easier to talk while wearing a mask.  Unfortunately, the clips on the sides of this device does a poor job of holding it in place.  This ends ups sliding around and then easily falling off when I carefully remove my mask.  This was a let down but not a bad initial idea, just poorly executed."
2.0,Ordered these because they said 18g. Not even close. I have had my septum for 8 years and had gone down to 18g about 4 years ago. This was the same size as my old 16g jewelry. Sad because I was looking forward to using it.
2.0,"Ten√≠a mucho miedo por esta prenda .la llevo puesta desde que llego y ya NO esta igual .voy a devilver<br /><br />..No es que este prieta ,pero el brillo lindo se a ido‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùåü§î .. nueva rese√±a,la argolla que agarra el coraz√≥n se puso de otro color ,üò¢"
2.0,The soles were the correct size but the top elastic areas are huge.  Cute shoes but they flop around and do not provide a snug fit by any stretch of the imagination.
2.0,Nice Daniel but they gave me major camel toe
2.0,"The watch works fine so far, but the LED display is not crisp at all, and difficult to read in daylight and even at night sometimes. It's blurry for some reason. But for the price it works OK. Bought for work at night outside. It is definitely a throw away watch. Would not buy again. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Like so many have written here, the rose is VERY yellow. The rose is glued on, so it may fall off, but I was really hoping it had a clasp like it said it does and there is no clasp--now I'm worried it's not going to sit right on all the different people I purchased this for."
2.0,Way too small. I used their size chart but it's just too small.
2.0,"I wanted to love this. I bought a bunch for an entire week in germy Las Vegas, and extras to share with teammates. However, after the first day I knew it was not going to work. It fogged up very easily and was hard to breathe. I sounded very muffled. It also kept falling down no matter what I would do. I gave this an extra star, because somebody told me that Dawn dish soap rubbed on the inside would help with the fogging, but I did not have any of that to try. Even so, it is the most uncomfortable mask I have ever worn and I quickly bought a replacement. I would recommend getting a face shield if you want everyone to see your beautiful smile."
2.0,I haven't had time to try it on yet... I opened it with my teenage daughter & we both thought it looked like a cooked tortilla/ burrito shell..
2.0,The material was scratchy feeling very disappointed I've bought this brand not this item before so yes i returned it
2.0,Loved it but it broke w in a wk
2.0,"I just received these socks, so have not tried them yet. However....the photo shows a black solid pair, and a gray pair with polka dots....which is what I thought I was ordering. I received black socks, one pair polka dotted....I just reread the description...BEWARE the description reads ‚Äúblack‚Äù....i‚Äôll Keep them since I can always use them, but It‚Äôs a bit of false advertising."
2.0,Clingy.  Tried a medium and a large and neither were flattering.
2.0,i have several packs which have differing sizes  ---  &#34;mid-rise&#34;  ---  L  --  &#34;38&#34;  --  the only size that truly fits were from the original purchase  ---  help  --  mort wapner
2.0,"The buckle came in gold instead of black as shown. It is a low cost item, the gold highlights that even more."
2.0,"I ordered a medium shirt because it was the smallest size offered. Unfortunately, the medium was way too large for me. To make things worse, the soft, stretchy material could not support the weight of the drains in the pockets very well, so the shirt constantly sagged down in front, making it even more uncomfortable.<br /><br />Overall, this shirt was a disappointing, depressing purchase. (Couldn't it come in a brighter color than gray or black, at least? Mastectomy surgery is depressing enough already!) In any case, if you are a slim person, I would not recommend this shirt at all."
2.0,Material much to thin and see through
2.0,I didn't like this top at all. Fit fine but wasn't the best look for me.  The back was a different material as stated but wasn't complimentary for me.  Might be perfect for you though.
2.0,"Very light weight; they feel cheap.  And the lense area is huge, bigger than it looked to me online.  I will be returning."
2.0,"it looks like a heavy nice sweater but its very thin, not impressed at all. You would have to wear a sweat shirt over it, or another sweater under it. Especially the arms, very thin. I won't buy again that's for sure"
2.0,"The over all fit was great.  I ordered a large.  I am 5' 41/2 and about 150 lbs.  The fit was nice, however, the picture shows that it would hang above the knee.  On me the length was very long.  It hit right above my calf.  Due to this it was not flattering on me.  On a taller person the dress would be nice with tall boots, ankle boots or even sandals with a heal .  But for me... my husband said, ""Is this your new Little House on the Prairie dress""?  Therefore I returned it.  The material was very nice.  A great dress to look nice and not get wrinkled throughout the day.  I'd say great for maybe someone 5'7 and taller."
2.0,Leotard ripped after washing it once. Wouldn't  buy again.
2.0,Looks extremely cheap for my MK watch. It was hard to put on and pops off often
2.0,The shirt itself is really cute but the bands around the wrist are too tight and do not ease tightness when stretched. So much so that my wrist strap broke. It‚Äôs some sort of weird stretchy rope instead of rubber band type. Bummer. Not sure if it‚Äôs fixable. I am 5‚Äô7 Weigh 130 And bought a Med. it fit perfectly other than the wrists being too tight. Hangs to mid hip
2.0,"The hat arrived in a large box, there seemed to be good packing materials, but once I got to the actual hat inside the box, it was crushed.  Given that there was no damage to the outside of the box and the ample packing materials, it seems that possibly the hat was placed inside the box, already damaged.  The hat did ""pop"" back into shape but there are large creases in it that are visible, so I won't be using it."
2.0,It's a really cute swim suit but it has no support on the top and is very easy to become lose.
2.0,The gloves are too bulky
2.0,Turned green!
2.0,"Yes, it works.  That said save your money and go to your local Radio Shack or Harbor Freight and buy the appreciate size &#34;heat shrink&#34; for electrical wire.  It works as well and is cheaper."
2.0,"We ordered that for an eleven year old birthday. She is a dog liver and my daughter was really excited about this necklace. The necklace came in well packaged and when we opened it,, there was a rust stain on top of the little dog‚Äôs head. I understand it‚Äôs not an expensive necklace but it is cute enough. If it wasn‚Äôt for the rust that is clearly visible. I would have returned if we received it earlier. But the night before the birthday was too late. Very disappointing."
2.0,As soon as I put the first one on. The stitching was coming undone . Not a good sign
2.0,"Length is off - goes down past the bottom of the hips, and it looks messy.  Very soft fabric, color was really pretty."
2.0,Does not look like pictures
2.0,"This is a really reasonable package and would be ideal for children going to Disney to trade pins.  I was disappointed with the variety.  I had two pins that were duplicates and more than half of the collection was black and white or gray and white.  From the pictures displayed, I expected most of the pins to be colorful and they were not.  Also, I received five pins that were a character I did not recognize - it is an orange?  I was excited to get this in the mail and a little disappointed after I opened it.  If you are trading the pins - it is a GREAT deal and I would highly recommend it for that purpose - they are ALL official Disney pins with quality backing."
2.0,I plan to return it so my husband didn't try it on. The Velcro flat piece makes the shirt look cheap and he didn't like it.
2.0,Like the side panels for sun protection but it has Velcro to secure the cap. My pony tail anways gets wrapped in the Velcro and pulls my hair out when taking off. Needs a better fit
2.0,I ordered the W and the T style but both came in the T style. Mother's Day was ruined<br /> I tried to order the style W again with no luck. I liked the overall quality for everyday wear.
2.0,Definitely not a swimsuit for big boobs. Lots of underboob showed. There's no underside of built in bra. Other than being super cute I wasn't impressed with the quality
2.0,"Couldn‚Äôt get the clasp to work. It wasn‚Äôt a defective clasp, it is poorly made."
2.0,Extremely flimsy.
2.0,I read so many reviews on the sizes and went with a medium. The pink dress ran much larger than I expected. I reordered a small and it was the exact same size (see photo). I ordered the same dress in another color and it‚Äôs a different brand and size.
2.0,I liked it until my letters started coming off
2.0,Material was heavy
2.0,"El tama√±o del Jersey muy peque√±o, lo compre S y es realmente como XS"
2.0,"This purse is way smaller then described.  More for a child.<br />No pocket inside, made out of lighter fabric then other purses<br />of hers I'd bought.  Doubt I'll buy another Laurel Burch bag!!!"
2.0,Very very chintzy you have to wear two or three gloves at a time because they break so easily
2.0,I like it but it came with holes in it.
2.0,Too heavy and it kept on falling. Not made for small ears
2.0,"While the quality was good for the price paid, the pieces were rather large. Much, much larger than anticipated. If they weren't so large I would say they'd be perfect for as child's costume jewelry.<br />The packaging was pretty ugly, as well, and the chain looked and felt very cheap.<br />Definitely not gift-worthy."
2.0,Bought an XXL and it fits like a Large
2.0,Dollar store sunglasses very flimsy would not recommend
2.0,"Ordered for my 7 year old daughter who is slim build about 50#.<br />The grey pair fits great, the black pair is too loose. As you can see from the photo the black is a different size than the grey even though they both say ""S"" on the label. So I got 2 pairs that fit (grey) and 2 that do not (black) but all the same size and packaged together. Makes sense...."
2.0,The length from the crotch to the legs were too short and my toddler couldn‚Äôt comfortably crouch down. Such a disappointment!
2.0,"If you're someone who is well endowed (as the woman in the picture is) this could be a great dress. Not the one for me. Also, the material was cheap looking :( I returned this dress."
2.0,Was for a wedding but arrived with missing stones
2.0,"The pole was way shorter than I expected.  Looks like it was made for a small child.  Also, the umbrella material is very cheap, similar to Ziploc bag material.  Was very disappointed to receive this."
2.0,"The material looks cheap and is weirdly heavy. The pattern looks odd on the pants, like there are two different legs."
2.0,After wearing the dress once I washed it as directed and now the colors are faded and the material looks worn. Definitely can‚Äôt wear it to a special occasion again or to work.
2.0,If you are not slim you will not like this item the way it is made you can not have any stomach at all. Nice color but bad fit
2.0,Did not like the quality of the product. I used them for my keys
2.0,"I didn‚Äôt like either of these shirts. I bought black and blue, same size, and they are both totally shaped differently. The blue is nearly 2 inches longer than the black, and is nearly 1 inch narrower than the black. The texture of each shirt is the same‚Äî thin and kind of bumpy. They are each really long and the cut is really narrow. The fit is much more like an athletic cut in men‚Äôs than a women‚Äôs. These are really only good as nightshirts for a child."
2.0,Wife was excited to get these but one was broken.  I rigged it back togeather but she did really like them
2.0,"The dress is so UGLY in person! The placement of the center and side sequins patterns are unflattering for women with wide hips. Beware! I bought a small and I am 5‚Äô5, 122 pounds size 7, it is form fitting, but not tight. There is however a back sag of material due to my hips and rectangle shape of the dress.<br /><br />It is cheaply made for the price. When I tired the dress on three fringes already fell off. Plus, the headband is too small, it hurts my head after a few minutes."
2.0,The sleeves were tight. The ready was perfect.
2.0,Is stretchy but stays that way its kind of big in a way id get a size smaller
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:b9ceb6856c2ec7d6601500a7db68d10b]] I got the set delivered yesterday (April 28th, 2021) and this video was taken today (April 29th, 2021). Upon arrival, the set was beautiful and the gold coloring in the necklace matched that of the bracelet (which is sadly also beginning to fade at the clasp). The necklace has not touched water whatsoever, I just simply wore it to work. As you can tell from the video, the necklace became dark in color and doesn‚Äôt even look gold anymore. It also unfortunately stained my neck pretty badly. It‚Äôs so sad that this happened in less than 24 hours. Many will say that ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù, but I‚Äôve bought cheaper jewelry pieces off of Amazon in the past and they have lasted me such a long time. I was so excited to wear this piece because it was stunning when I took it out of the package, but little did I know the quality was not what I anticipated at all."
2.0,"The soft material was super clingy and didn't lay or flow well....which is an essential part of a good wrap dress. The fit itself was fine, but it wasn't flattering in a wearable way."
2.0,Donar like
2.0,For a MEDIUM the arms were big like an EXLARGE. I have to now spend more money to adjust it.
2.0,"I read other reviews about a rash from the metal and decided to try anyways because they‚Äôre so cheap. When I got it, I saw that the metal doesn‚Äôt even touch your skin, the only part that makes contact is silicone. Well, the inside of my wrist got a rash after 2 days. Maybe it‚Äôs the silicone, or metal through the silicone? Just spent the money on another Apple band because those are comfortable and don‚Äôt give a rash."
2.0,"It's cute enough but unlike the picture, this top doesn't start floating outwards until it hits your hips. The picture looks like a cotton blend that's light and floaty but it's actually a stretchy, heavy fabric that lays down. Color was right on to what I thought it'd be but I don't like the way it fits. Will be returning."
2.0,Disappointed with the material.  Odd how the bottom of the shirt is kind of banded.
2.0,Mine came with a broken link :(
2.0,Cheap silicone. One ring broke within 2 weeks. I wrote the seller to take them up on their money back gaurantee with no response. Not worth the price.....
2.0,"Dress was cute, but the fabric was not good quality. The dress was see three. I ordered a size up based on other reviews and it was still too small."
2.0,I the comfort about the glove but is a problem when you take it out from your hand. And it doesn't keep your hands warm below zero not even below 20 degrees
2.0,Cute but it made me feel bigger than what I already felt. I'm 8 months pregnant and used it as a cover up for my dress. It dropped a little too far down but if I had shorts instead of a dress it would be good.
2.0,The wig arrived when it said it would but it didn't look like the picture. I bought it for my sons Halloween costume but he ended up not wearing it. We even tried to put gel in it to make it stand up like the picture but it did not work.
2.0,"Not super happy.. Very pretty, but fit like a napkin  :/"
2.0,This does NOT stay in place! It's constantly riding up and the material is weird. I will be donating.
2.0,Returned - Not what I had hoped.
2.0,"2 stars because it is so nice looking. However, arrived not working. Packing slip said extra battery included, but it was not. There was no way to replace battery anyway, with out going to a jeweler. Sent it back. I think this item has been discontinued....."
2.0,"The print is adorable and the quality is nice but I ordered a girls size 6 and it was very close to fitting me, a 32 year old woman. I had to give it to a larger child until my daughter is bigger, a lot bigger!"
2.0,The zipper broke 3 days after getting it. Fit was ok
2.0,"I don't over-stuff pockets, and already the front pocket is busted at the bottom and going into the pocket behind it"
2.0,Quality seemed great but I couldn't get it over my 1st graders head. Not sanitary to return so this was a loss unfortunately.
2.0,I had to return it because it was a thin material and see thru in white. But was a cute top and fit good it was just to thin and see thru
2.0,"I seem to be saying this a lot recently - you get what you pay for, and this is one of those items.  I purchased this specifically for Halloween to try and dress up the house a little more than usual since we have am 8, 6 and 4 yr old....  My wife and I both work, and we never seem to be the first to decorate for any of the holidays - because we never get to the stores before they're picked over by the early seasonal shoppers.  'Import' quality (in the old school way of looking at imports).... Obviously most goods, even today's best electronics, are 'imported'.  But when I say imported in this case I mean - low quality, cents on the dollar quality.  Heck, it's a 'Halloween Spider', but even with that said - it's cheaply made and I wouldn't recommend it to my neighbor or a friend.  I doubt it will make it to a second Halloween without losing a leg along the way."
2.0,The shoes are true to size and really really pretty but the velcro on the right shoe came off in the first use so the shoe cannot be fastened.
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this. It has a very nice fabric but the fit is awful. A little on the long side, but diameter wise I could put three of me in it. Definitely not a flattering fit. Also the belt loops are extremely high and several inches above the waist area."
2.0,Cute and comfortable but doesn't stay in place.  Magnets are the right size
2.0,"I like this dress, it's comfortable however it came with some discoloration."
2.0,Cute but the screw on ends always come off which is really annoying
2.0,The metal did not clip together on some. The wood broke in half while wearing others.
2.0,"The red is more of a brighter red, not the deep wine as in the picture. This is the type of material which will fade overtime. I'd be careful washing and recommend air drying to retain the color. It does fit true to size."
2.0,The fit of the dress what great however the material is very cheap looking. I returned the dress.
2.0,very broad at the toes which gives an awkward look
2.0,To heavy wont stay on
2.0,"They rip easily. Ripped before I even fully had it on. Didn't fit over my jacket. The rubber bands on the wrists were annoying. Bought for trip to Disneyland that it was supposed to rain. After waiting in one line and having put more than one hole in it, ripped it off and threw it in the trash. Will remember to read reviews next time"
2.0,Definitely made for women with small chest.
2.0,The clasp that holds the glasses &#34;arm&#34; broke within the first week.  The other parts are very durable.
2.0,Nice for about 2 uses then not sticky anymore. Will not purchase again!
2.0,I am going to return it unfortunately as it fits way too small
2.0,I only give this a 2 star because the ring size is way too tight on my ring finger. I ordered a size 8 and it's not true to size. But it looks great on my pinky finger!
2.0,Not what I expected due to the clips. The shirt slips out of the clasp.
2.0,They are cute but takes too long to get them
2.0,The bra does not support medium to large breasted women.
2.0,"Great length tie, looks great on first wear.<br />HOWEVER if you plan on wearing this more than once, FON'T BUY THIS TIE. The material looks good but is very cheap. I work in a fancy restaurant so I try to buy low priced ties like this, since they are inevitably going to get stained, but long before this tie even got a chance to get stained, it looked far too ratty to wear. There were little pulls all over the fabric, the tag on the back fell off completely, and all of the stitching had started to come undone. I got through about 4 shifts with this before it was in the trash.<br />So, if you're looking for a cost effective tie for all of your groomsmen to wear at a wedding (aka to wear ONCE) go for it. If you're looking for an everyday tie, look elsewhere."
2.0,"It works, however, when entering mesh mode with an R1 helmet, volume levels are reduced to levels that make it very difficult to hear and there is no ability to adjust that volume. Makes it almost useless with the ambient noises incurred on bike rides.<br /><br />UPDATE: Working with Sena I was advised to roll R1 firmware back to 1.2.2 from current 1.4.1. Volume issue was fixed, they are working on permanent fix."
2.0,This shirt is very thin and see-through.  I returned it.
2.0,I wish I would have returned they are very baggy I would say one to two size down then what you normally wear.<br />Cheaply made and stretchy.
2.0,Let's just say don't plan on wearing these 24hrs or 8 they will definitely have that funky green color by the time you remove them. üòÖ They definitely were cute while they lasted. I actually have a few more I haven't worn that I plan to give away. I'd rather get a real septum piercing than purchase these again. The shipping was prompt & they were neatly packaged .
2.0,After having to have surgery last year because of stepping on something on the beach I needed something to protect my feet. I wore these for 3 days while on vacation and they got worse each day. The sole is not sewn in and moved around constantly which was super annoying in the water. The heel of the sole also started to rip apart. After wearing them for a few hours they rubbed and caused sores on my toes. I was not impressed with these at all.
2.0,strap broke off.
2.0,First one I ordered lasted 3 weeks... then broke.... 2nd one lasted 3 days before breaking away from the stone..... at first I really loved it..and was hoping it would last longer... but alas... we get what we pay for.... Good luck with your purchase..<br /><br />*Note - I've ordered other pieces from West Coast and they are fine and of great quality... so maybe its just something with this one in particular.
2.0,Don‚Äôt luke
2.0,Came with a hole in it... i was planning this for a specific outfit tonight so hopefully i can fix it.. or im stuck with a shirt with what resembles a cigarette burn in it when i dont even smoke
2.0,"Bought these because the reviews were on the whole positive AND because they were significantly less expensive than the Oofos I needed to replace to wear around the house.<br />These Fantures look very similar to my Oofos, fit fine and feet perspire a bit more than with the Oofos.<br />More importantly, from the initial steps, these Fantures have been the noisiest pair of shoes I own, squeaking incessantly and loudly. I may as well be wearing a bell around my neck.<br />The first night I wore them, these shoes woke up my sleeping wife as I walked into the bedroom! That had never happened with my Oofos...unhappy wife, unhappy life?<br /> I now cannot wear these Fantures at night when I'm anywhere near my sleeping family.<br />Good cushioning bumped this up to a 2-star item."
2.0,It looks cool but its pretty small. The size almost makes it look feminine.
2.0,"Contrast between dial & hands is too muted to easily read. Even during daylight, glare from ""crystal"" cover can obscure dial. Automatic wind power reservoir is deficient, watch loses time or stops overnight. I will replace the watch, whether or not returns are acceptable."
2.0,Runs large.  Returned mostly because these were more off white than a bright white.
2.0,When I received the bracelet one of the stones wasn‚Äôt attached and I wore it one day and all the stones have fallen off as well as one of the names. Not happy at all üò≠
2.0,The pants are a great idea but a small isn't tight enough
2.0,"The size is not true... XL is like a size 1... but it was CHEAP AND CAME ON TIME. EVEN THOUGH IT'S SUPER SMALL, ITS MADE SO BEAUTIFULLY... WISH I COULD HAVE FIT IT..."
2.0,Too expensive for this simple watch
2.0,"They look real cool. They were comfortable and fit my 4 year old son very well. They are not durable at all. Fell off his face the other day and the top of the frame above left lens completely split open causing the lens to fall out. The lens remained intact, which is a huge plus, but the frame damage should not have been this severe from the light impact that occurred. Not worth the money."
2.0,"This was VERY small, I couldn't get it over my head! I normally wear a size XL but that is not the size of this top!"
2.0,"After minimal use I took them off my face and the arm just disintegrated and fell off. Ya get what you pay for. Also, the blue tint was really just gold. Disappointing purchase."
2.0,Nice pants BUT the 36 fit like 34
2.0,"Very pretty necklace, but unfortunately mine broke within the first day of wearing it. The clasp wouldn't close and broke off :/<br />Other than that such a pretty necklace"
2.0,"I love the style and design of the earrings however, trying to fasten them to wear is a nightmare.  That in my opinion needs to be fixed the next time I order earrings on this style I will pay closer attention to the fastener.  I can only recommend purchasing this style if you have someone to fasten them for you.‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,Cape is good but the closer sucks! Its 2 hooks that hook on either side and it can be kinda tight!
2.0,print is not flattering. returned it.
2.0,"No real fit in the heel of the shoe, it kept slipping off.  Had to return."
2.0,"Just a hook and loop strap ‚Ä¶..,not really a watch band"
2.0,"the straps fit strange, very close to the toes. I sent them back."
2.0,"I got this shirt for work and like another review said, the armpit holes are really big and it showed my bra. Since it was for work I couldn't wear it so I returned it."
2.0,The material was very thin<br />......the size came smaller than the average U.S. medium<br />The color was pretty though
2.0,The masks ripped on day one. Couldn't even use them. Material flimsy
2.0,These only fit very small end small glasses. Not functional for normal sunglasses...
2.0,I love the look and the fit of these shirts.  The white one however is almost see-through.  Not appropriate for the gym
2.0,Quality not as bad and the size is too small‚Ä¶really small.
2.0,"I expected more durability out of this lanyard but the design failed after 6 months, I work in the travel industry and I will not buy this again."
2.0,"The first one I bought lasted awhile but the last one only lasted a couple of months. I'm trying one more, will see how long it lasted. That will tell if I buy another one."
2.0,"The opening is entirely too small to be off the shoulder, which is the reason why I purchased this item."
2.0,Ordered XXL due to remarks. Normally wear xl Had to  give it to a girl in my office that wears a medium. Fits her perfect. Size is Way smaller than chart suggest
2.0,I needed an option for a seven year old boy-they are cute but not a warm style at all.  Returning them
2.0,it badly made when i got it the monkey had this glie all over it i think its a fake
2.0,"For some reason this one doesn't work like my old ones that I had purchased in the a store.  I tried putting in my hair; it was frustrating.  I gave up.  I tried pre-bending it--I thought maybe because it was new. But, it was not bending once the bun was up and ready, and it didn't bend to complete the bun.<br />I had these before.  Same brand.  The brand I like.  I don't know.  Maybe it was a defect."
2.0,Not even close to large enough
2.0,material is not good. my daughter is thin but this came out (and we used the measurement table) way tooo small
2.0,It was clearly not the same dress that was showing in the pictures.
2.0,I hate the way it looks on me its definitely not flattering!!
2.0,"Ordered a 10. Normally I might get a 12 but 10 was the biggest and it says it runs big. This thing is labeled XXL. In no part of North America is a 10 equivalent to and xxl. The measurements are bust 50.5 inches (10 would be closer to 38), waist 49 inches (should be closer to 32 to be a 10).<br />It is nhl branded so I‚Äôm going to go to their site to see what the sizing really is.<br />The quality is great. It‚Äôs thick and well constructed."
2.0,Too big. Will be returning.
2.0,The only thing that changed is it made everything yellow. I still couldn‚Äôt see better driving at night
2.0,"These are just super thin, ankle socks. There is no cushion or support or much of anything to them. I will wear them  when i wear shoes that require a thin sock, maybe once or twice or until the white starts to look off, and then I will throw them in the trash/ recycle them."
2.0,theyre too big and should be sleeker... not to mention mine were spray painted and not actually Just plastic ones
2.0,Too tight in and the chest  but really large neck
2.0,I can not really say much about the quality as I ordered this based on it saying it was a larger size.  This runs the same as the large band from Apple.  It is not larger like noted.
2.0,"I love the softness but it's to hard to walk in them. I bought them for myself and my daughter for her wedding day. In between getting our make up, hair done, and pictures we kept sliding out of the slippers."
2.0,Unlike the pictures this band does not have a second set of holes in the clasp to allow for fine adjustment. All links are the same size so this is critical for fit. Quality feels decent and the quick-fit clasps worked well but I will be returning due to the design.
2.0,Fabric is very thin. Felt more like a shirt then a sweatshirt. I‚Äôm returning it.
2.0,very flimsy and doesn't feel secure.  I probably won't use it since what I need to conceal probably would not fit or fabric might rip?
2.0,My girlfriend had a pair of fuzzy slipper that were warmer than anything I ever wore. These did not even come close. We broke up before I found out where she got hers.
2.0,The product is not what was expected<br />I ordered copper arthritis relief gloves  they xl  dice must be for the Chinese lady that made them.<br />Will not order from them again
2.0,0-6 month looks like a 2T or something...my baby will NOT be able to wear this...what a waste. We were so excited for this to come in too.
2.0,"Robe is very soft and solid black but your size description is way off. A small says the length is 25""... I measured 23"" which was too short for my child. I will be returning this item and keeping the review at two stars until accurate sizing is listed."
2.0,"This sweater isn‚Äôt just too big, it‚Äôs put together really weird, like it‚Äôs a second run. The back, from shoulder to shoulder is very wide and gaps in the middle. This makes the shoulders fall off. I just tailored the back to pull the shoulders up. I like the cottony knit but fit is off."
2.0,The chain is too thin. It broke after a few uses.
2.0,Cute but 2 diamonds fell out first day
2.0,"I didn't expect a very high quality set of glasses for what the cost of these were, but I did expect to be able to wear them and see clearly. The lenses are a bit blurry and I just can't wear them because the blur hurts my eyes."
2.0,The straps are short and don't allow you to make it for an adult head.<br />Are they being cheap on the length of the strap.
2.0,"Cute, but very tiny and not a great quality.  I like the idea behind the style, but it was very short in the torso, tight in the bust, and the shiny &#34;scales&#34; were slightly rubbed away."
2.0,"Black shirt,there is no way it's 3xxx! Put different shirt with it back to back,its way smaller cant wear it too little! Want to send it back and get my money refund! Please reply!!!!ü§î"
2.0,"I bought the Blue striped dress and the solid red in the same size (M). The striped dress fit well but the solid was way too tight in chest, arms, and thigh area. Returned the solid red."
2.0,"I was hoping these would be as comfortable as my Sanuk's, but they are not. They're pretty hard. For the price, I'll just wear them as yard shoes."
2.0,"Took a long time to arrive, item was actually 2 sizes too small, material was cheap and covered with lint."
2.0,I don‚Äôt like these facemask because they are baggy inside after you wash them. And then it‚Äôs harder to breathe because it wrinkles up next year nose and mouth
2.0,"Per my wife, these run really small and are made for petite teenagers only,"
2.0,"I‚Äôm so sad, the earrings were cute but the bell shaped backings fell off then the hook design makes it easy for the earrings to fall out. Within three days I lost my earrings from them falling out"
2.0,They come to small
2.0,Runs large. Returned dress
2.0,"I returned this item.  The fit was weird.  The elastic was right under my boobs instead of at my waist.  Also, the pattern appeared blurry on the material.  I guess you get what you pay for when it's a $20 dress."
2.0,"I read reviews and used the size guidelines for this jacket.  Yeah‚Ä¶.  No.<br /><br />According to the chart, I should be a XL, normally, I wear 46 Reg.  I think the XL is generally right, it‚Äôs the size I normally wear.  When I received the coat, yes, like the other reviews say, it was very wrinkled.  That said, I‚Äôm buying it from Amazon for $70, not a men‚Äôs store for $400, so I expect that I‚Äôll have to steam it to wrinkle free.  Not worried about that.<br /><br />The real issue was the size.  When I put it on, I felt like I could pull my arms together and shred the coat like the Hulk.  It was very tight around the chest.  The sleeves were also very short and if you think you‚Äôre going to roll or push them up, think again.  The sleeves were super narrow, I could barely get them to mid forearm. It was just too small in every place.  Too bad, it was a nice looking jacket and I wanted it to fit but here I am.  I returned it.<br /><br />Again, if you want to feel like the Hulk and rip your clothes apart from your (seemingly) massive chest and arms, go for it, just make sure you have the Black Widow around to say ‚Äúthe sun's getting real low.‚Äù to bring you down."
2.0,It's ok. I had hope that it was more sturdy metal and maybe like a key. The chain was just a cheap chain so I changed it out but going to try to make it work. Hopefully it won't turn my neck green.
2.0,It did not work for my husband. But the idea was great!
2.0,"Short almost cropped. Semi fitted. Bought the large. 34dd, 145lbs"
2.0,The bottoms are perfect but the top is made for someone that doesn't have much up top...
2.0,Unfortunately I was never able to try them on to attest to the fit or sheerness. When I got the package I was excited until I opened it. The smell was awful. I know that sometimes things can have a strong smell and you need to let them air out. This wasn't one of those times. The skirts smells like mildew and mold and had such a strong chemical smell that it burned my eyes and nose. I had to reseal the bag because it could be smelled even across the room. I chose to return them without getting a new set so I can't say whether this was a fluke but it was so bad I didn't want to risk it to find out.
2.0,"My Husband told me it looks like an apron because of the material, but it was nice to have as a swim suit cover up shirt."
2.0,Wore twice and it started to discolor and then broke in the middle
2.0,Its boxie looking when its on.
2.0,"I was very happy that the delivery was way earlier than expected. However, when I open the package the smell of those leggings was so toxic that I wouldn't even try them on. So I don't know how to write the product other than Amazon's delivery was awesome"
2.0,bike suit at least one size smaller than labeled.  Padding much less than in products offered by other manufacturers.  Do not recommend.
2.0,This shirt was. Very small.
2.0,"This lists a small as size 4-6, I received this bathingsuit, i am a size 3/4 but this bathing suit doesn't even come halfway up my torso"
2.0,Tight around the arms
2.0,The strap started peeling and the ornament on the purse fell off. All of this happened after two weeks. Not a good buy.
2.0,"I have had these 2 weeks, the lens coating looks like its wearing off, kinda splotchy looking. I would not recommend base on durability. Item not eligible for return."
2.0,"Even with integrated pins, they fit so loosely that the band pops off my wrist."
2.0,"Cute shoes, but not good for toddlers. I didn‚Äôt see that there is a thin layer of some kind of lace, that tears. The first time my toddler wore these, she scuffed the toe, which tore that lace stuff. It sucks because the shoes are cute and fit well."
2.0,I thought it would be a bit bigger than that the way the picture looks but I love the colors
2.0,"The large was too small for my size 8 feet. It did not come close to covering the balls of my feet. Elastic cut into both the top of my foot and between the toes. Maybe if it fits it would be better, but they have L listed at 8-8.5 and that is not what it is."
2.0,Beautiful colors. Just don't like the material
2.0,"I have a longish torso, and this did not fit me at all, the overall shirt was too short, and the breast cups were way to high so my boobs fell out underneath the support structure. But the pattern and color was beautiful I wish it would have worked for me, and I would recommend it for someone who is shorter."
2.0,Bought for my daughter. chain broke when she removed it from the package.
2.0,"I didn't love these. They did fit as expected, so that's good. But the fabric didn't have any heft to it, so they kind of sunk into any bulges and lumps. I have a different pair from a different brand, and they slide on and are so flattering. These didn't. They also had such a high waist that it pulled in the crotch area. Just not great for me. I returned."
2.0,It was beautiful but snagged on my lace dress several times within minutes! It ruined one of my lace sleeves. I had to remove it.
2.0,Cute shirt but I ordered a ladies large since I like my t-shirts loose (I normally wear a medium) and it fits like a small medium.  Either mis-sized or it shrunk in the wash.  Very disappointed.
2.0,It‚Äôs a cute necklace but it literally turned copper color after a day of wearing it.
2.0,don't like them at all I wear glasses and cannot use them when I have glasses on at all another wasted purchase by me.
2.0,It is bulky on the fingers.
2.0,It‚Äôs proportions were off chest part was loose the stomach part tight I sold this dress so got rid of it
2.0,"I ordered my normal size and it was WAY too small--like, so small I couldn't even put it on. I held it up to other skirts that are the same size (but different brands) and the waist was SEVERAL inches smaller. Love the color, but I'm so disappointed and have to return it because it's way too small."
2.0,vary thin can bent out of shape vary easily
2.0,Had to glue one back onto the finding when they arrived.
2.0,"I purchased this item seeing the affordable price for three piece combo set, but the item arrive with only one piece."
2.0,Way to short and no stretch
2.0,It's strange material and boxy shape.
2.0,"Got this for my husband as a costume for halloween or other events and the legs have the section with laces facing the same direction on both legs, meaning they aren't both facing outwards on each leg. Flawed design but good otherwise."
2.0,Broke after about 5 uses.
2.0,The seam is in the worst place and makes the hat fit and look weird. Returned
2.0,It‚Äôs super cute but my daughter got it from Christmas and barely even wore it and it stopped working.  They sent a replacement one and it came all scratched up and with chips in the screen.  Other than that it‚Äôs cute and she loves it.
2.0,I love the way that this band feels and looks. The issue for me is the metal clasp rings on the back of the band. They are clunky and scratch the surface of my laptop while I type. It's a big enough problem for me that I will be replacing the band with a different one. If the metal claps were replaced with some sort of non-abrasive clasp this would be the perfect band.
2.0,Pro : material is great :)<br />Con - even with proper measurements these couldn't fit my butt inn them :(<br /><br />Summation - great for women/men with smaller thighs and booty
2.0,"Not true to size! I measured my daughter. The 2x should've given her extra room and not of been tight.  No parts of the costume don't fit.  The dress, jacket and shoe/leg covers are the only thing to fit.  For what I paid I am furious. If my daughter didn't like it.  I would return it."
2.0,"All my pants are XL, so I though XL would fit with these, and yet they were far too small.<br /><br />Definitely buy them bigger than what you need."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap the material looks and feels like plastic üò°
2.0,This watch does look  nice but it tarnishes quickly it started tarnishing in less than two weeks after having it.
2.0,"One out of the 3 shirts came defective. I'm not the only customer who has had this situation. If you buy, you are taking a gamble. Company should just make good quality from the start."
2.0,I look like the statue of liberty.
2.0,"My keeps kept falling off my carabineer when I would grab it and accidently pull open the clamp. I decided I need one that had a screw mechanism to help prevent this. After looking at what Amazon had to offer I thought these looked like better carabineers than some others.  I think the colors deceived me. They aren‚Äôt superb quality. The screw mechanism doesn‚Äôt have a stop on it either. Some of the better ones have a wider area to stop the screw, with this one the screw lock thing can continue to be screwed all the way up or down the straight side (I hope that makes sense). So, basically I paid a little more for the jungle theme of carabineer."
2.0,"Look ok, but are extremely cheap & flimsy."
2.0,"It was a pretty dress, BUT there was a hole in the center of the front (too big to patch), zipper was sewn in sideways so when you zipped it up it created a weird hump, and the collar was different from left to right."
2.0,"I  bought them for work. They looked cute. The material is cheap but I can get past that, considering that they were in Fact cheap.  The fit is just really awkward. They are super high rise, which is great for me because I have a long torso. The problem is the fit around the  hips and butt. I'm 5'8, 145 lbs and have wide hips, a pretty ""small to average"" waist and a good sized bottom.  I thought these would be perfect. Despite being bottom heavy, and long waisted,  I feel these are just a  weird fit."
2.0,It‚Äôs too small than expected.We cannot use it. It‚Äôs cotton not much polyester that‚Äôs why I choose it but it‚Äôs not suit size. I am not happy with that buy.
2.0,"Looks very cute but it's not for girls with larger than a C cup, maybe a D. I'm a 34 E and even in an extra large there was no room for the girls."
2.0,The color was not as expected. I expected a dark navy blue but I believe the sent the dark blue instead. Its not worth returning.
2.0,I‚Äôm a normal medium. Top was a weird cut and Capri bottoms too small. I ordered to size. Waste of money. Material itself was nice - disappointing
2.0,Cute glasses but my son popped out the lenses easily within the first 2 minutes.
2.0,The fake jewel fell out easily.... other than that it was fine
2.0,It looks great but it left green dye on my neck.
2.0,"the material in itself seems ok, however the xl is almost 1xl."
2.0,The fabric is cute and feels like what you would expect a hair cutting Cape to feel like but the neck hole is adult sized and didn't keep any hair from going down my son's neck.
2.0,The top under the arms were baggy
2.0,Extremely fragile.  Broke while I was wearing it.
2.0,"I received this purse today and did not receive the dust bag.  Also, where is the clear tag with the serial number?  All my other MK purses have that sewn into one of the seams and this one does not.  The description states this is 'AUTHENTIC' however I am starting to doubt that. Also, the bottom of the 'price tag' that is attached to the inside of the bag is cut crooked."
2.0,"Order a size or two up , runs really small . Adorable though!"
2.0,"The arms are extremely tight, I couldn't move my shoulders, and it was cutting off circulation."
2.0,I like the top but it is very big. I am 6'2 and a size 10 (not big or small). I ordered the medium and small. Medium was too big.
2.0,"This is my second pair of readers, I've bought from this seller and I'm totally disappointed with them, AGAIN! Sure, they're nice looking, classy, sturdy, the magnification's up to par, etc., but BOTH pairs came so CROOKED!!!"
2.0,"I am sure it's a great top/swing dress, but one of the sleeves on the one I received was small than the other and didn't fit right. I returned it. It was cute to look at though."
2.0,These were cut too small and the length was below my knees.
2.0,"At first I was in love with this dress, it was great and I wore it twice, the only thing being the zipper was extremely sticky and took a long time to zip. However at the end of the second wear, the entire zipper just separated from the dress due to poor stitching. And the zipper is also fully stuck now and will not go up or down no matter what. I was definitely hoping for a dress that lasted longer than 2 wears."
2.0,"It is very soft, light, warm. Fits bigger than I  thought it would. Inner button fell off first time I put it on. Buttons do not stay buttoned . Have got compliments on it. Just disappointed in the quality."
2.0,The boots are very tight and feel really cheap. There are better boots for less at Walmart and Payless. The belts also do not wrap around. Very disappointed
2.0,"The dress is super cute and flattering, but the button falling off the very first time I tried it on was a HUGE disappointment. Now I either have to sew (and I don't have time for it!) or return it based on the poor quality."
2.0,"Bought this necklace for my granddaughter as a Christmas gift. Very disappointed with it. You can't even read the words on it, except<br />With a magnifying glass, not at all what I expected, looks very cheap."
2.0,Cute concept but is way to short in length of bodysuit
2.0,Dislike because it gets uncomfortable
2.0,Toe slips through
2.0,Quick delivery but the metal part that holds the band on fell off the first time I put it on. I am trying to return it.
2.0,It worked great for the first 2 months.... Then the band broke apart where it screwed into the actual garmin. It's like the glue just went away
2.0,Lights didn‚Äôt work on one shoe!! Wasn‚Äôt a good Christmas gift for my daughter..should have went somewhere else to get these!! She only wore them twice!!
2.0,"Too sheer to wear without a full-length slip underneath, even if you're wearing flesh tones. Sheer enough to be cheap looking and feeling. Too bad because otherwise the color is attractive (I received a peach color)."
2.0,I thought the material would be more like sweat suit.  It was a nylon/polyester.
2.0,The cover has already separating in less than 2 months
2.0,Product fit nicely and the material is stretchy and comfortable. The 2 stars are because the item arrived missing a front button and the zipper sticks and was detaching from the dress itself.<br />Thankfully I have extra buttons and can resucure the zipper otherwise i would have returned.<br />Price should be about $20 for the poor stitching quality
2.0,I had really hoped these would be the ones to replace the ORIGINAL ORIGINAL Teva Mush.  No.
2.0,"Horrible quality. I would never pay $20 for these if i was able to actually see and feel the quality before hand. I'd pay $10 for them. $10 is the price you pay for 4 QUALITY fruit of the loom wife beaters. These have NO compression. They are VERY see through and VERY thin. I gave 2 stars because they actually sized it right. I ordered a size and it is the right size. Man, at least they did one thing right."
2.0,Worn them for a few weeks and they are already tearing and shearing kinda like pantyhose does.also the threads are coming apart
2.0,The photo shows shiny earrings but what arrived were matte in texture which is not what I wanted
2.0,"The shirt fits good and is comfortable, however it's poorly made. The heart started peeling off after the very first wash."
2.0,The color very dull
2.0,"Shirt is quite small for the size; customer service with the return left much to be desired - since I had tried the shirt on, I could not return it for anything but store credit - with a merchant who doesn't make clothes my size.  The shirt is beautiful - the material is great - but I'd likely need to order 2 sizes larger than I normally wear."
2.0,fits small. Very small.
2.0,"Dress has pockets which I must have not read carefully. The dress is very boxy and if you‚Äôre not tall and thin, it will not be flattering."
2.0,"This did not work with my body type. I have a loooot of hip and when I moved around or sat, the belt would move around, expose stomach, my hips would bulge out, etc. it did not hold the shape I originally put it in. I had high hopes originally bc of the reviews, but I ended up returning it for a refund. And just for reference, I am 203 lbs, XL, and an hourglass figure with emphasis on the hips."
2.0,Sizing ultimately forced my wife to return her pair. Too narrow
2.0,"This shows every bump you ever had.  Quite uncomfortale to wear, it sticks to your skin."
2.0,Not sure if authentic. Presentation was cheap (plastic baggie and tiny A-shaped generic gift box with a sticker- nothing like the beautiful packaging used in the Pandora stores.)
2.0,This jacket was not as thick as it looked in the picture! The material felt like a cheap plastic table cloth and the ‚ÄúEddie Bauer‚Äù label print rubbed off after one wash...Not worth the price and should sell for $5 or less! Was too thin. I gave a 2 star rating only because I received the jacket quick and the weather was not as cold as it was supposed to be.
2.0,I ordered them a size up. Glad I did . but these I will only!wear at !home. The fabric was disappointing to say the least. Kind of like a cheap t shirt.
2.0,"The pants had a nice stretch but were too short for my 5‚Äô9‚Äù frame. I also thought the flares were a little small, almost like a pot cut instead of a true bell bottom. Will return."
2.0,broke apart the first day I had it on
2.0,"Great quality socks, but they are too small. I wear a U.S. size 11‚Äù shoe, but these socks physically will not fit over my foot. They might fit a size 9‚Äù foot."
2.0,This dress I ordered a L and it was closer to a med-small
2.0,This did not look good on me at all. I am 5'5'' and usually wear an XL. That's what I ordered this dress in. It was a really big on me and looked like a karate outfit. I never wore it. It was also really thick.
2.0,The nose pieces broke within the first month. The upper viewing part of the glasses distorts the view. The glasses do darken when outside and the magnifier lower part does it's job. Just wish they were better quality.
2.0,Looks more like a man's undershirt. Not a deep v as advertised. The material is nice and stretchy. Ran large. I returned.
2.0,Worn 3-4 times and the zipper broke on one of the legs
2.0,"Normally I order medium jackets, with this item the body/torso fit great like an athletic cut medium but the arms are ridiculously small and short rendering it unusable, think extra small.  I returned it and tried the large which now has medium size arms but the torso is huge, like XL- very baggy.  I‚Äôll keep it and use it around the yard but I don‚Äôt recommend these until they figure out their sizing.  Shrinking it in the wash didn‚Äôt make enough difference.  Material wise, it feels great and looks great."
2.0,Cheap t shirt. Thought it was a higher quality t shirt.
2.0,The clasp of the bag broke after 3 months of light use.
2.0,"It is a slim fit, I ordered a large, it seemed like a small"
2.0,The arms are huge and flowing but I still like it as the torso fits well. I'm a full XL but if I was thinner I would go a size down for sure.
2.0,I had to return this item. It fit good from the top area. The bottom was just way too loose.
2.0,Nice product but I'd recommend getting a slides larger than what you wear.
2.0,"it looked nothing like the picture, and was extremely large, I will have to have it tailored made and the bodice did not look like a heart on me."
2.0,Had to return it cause it runs small.
2.0,"They didn't fit well, and fogged up completely very quickly.  I'd recommend spending more and getting something higher quality."
2.0,"I have been using these RL boxer shorts for many years and have reordered them repeatedly. The manufacturer has changed the pattern of the cut and I find them too skirt-like.  The leg area is too big and flares out, the crotch area is too small.  The fabric is thinner and lighter. I'll not be ordering them again."
2.0,"There is no problem with the quality of the suit, it is too loose for me, has been returnedÔºå"
2.0,These fit really weird. I have a grey one that came from a retailer. That one is normal. These have like no stretch in the bottom part of the sleeves at your hand/wrist so it feels uncomfortably tight at the wrists when you‚Äôre trying to get it on and off. I‚Äôm pretty small but purchased a larger size and it‚Äôs still very uncomfortable at the wrists. The fabric needs to be turned so that there‚Äôs stretch in the wrists.I‚Äôve never had a sweatshirt/hoodie fit like this ever. It ruins what is otherwise a very comfortable hoodie.
2.0,"I got the XS for the shortest length but the waist is extremely small like it's meant for someone who's super slender. I can't get a larger size because the length would be longer, and that's not what I want. It is a really pretty skirt no doubt but definitely not made for me. I have found other skirts on Amazon that I will be looking into."
2.0,Looks nicer online than when you get it.
2.0,"Compr√© nuevamente el vestido y la tema es de peor calidad , una decepci√≥n"
2.0,The elastic waistband is super thick and bulky.
2.0,"The size chart is off, its one size small. So order one size larger.<br />The wrist band is non-elastic so it wont fit tight, but would flap around, making it look a bit weird and it defintely does not match the pictures."
2.0,I bought this for a charm bracelet. I‚Äôm disappointed in this because the side not seen is flat and not three dimensional as I had hoped. It is small but acceptable if the charm was 3 dimensional!
2.0,"These pants are 100% see through. The material is basically polyester, so not the most comfortable. Now, the fit is a little odd and the overall apparence look okay, until you put them on and see your butt cheeks. With a second layer, I might have liked them a little more"
2.0,Not a perfect fit for Flak 2.0; was not able to use them as they did not fit the rail for my flak 2.0.
2.0,"waaay too small! I have a small head, in it doesn't even begin to fit. gave it to my 4yo."
2.0,Love it but sizing is off. Armpits are tight.
2.0,Material was very thin and very very hard to weed it's like it was old or something.
2.0,this product was defective and I sent it back. The sellers did refund my money completely.
2.0,"I hate to write a bad review about these earrings as they are Beautiful, lightweight and quality abalone shell!! However, I got one set built backwards with the back facing forward and thought it was just a fluke- so returned and got replacement pair..., SAME issue!!! Somebody in quality control may have been on break when a couple ( I hope) of earrings slid out screwed up. I even thought I might could swivel them around to get shell shiny side facing forward but they‚Äôre too rigid. So having to return these new ones also! What a hassle - I don‚Äôt get breaks much at work so now gotta find UPS drop off place."
2.0,Was looking forward to this to finish off my Doctor Who winter set. It's really tight. My head is small. I have too tighten standard ball caps! So tried popping the front and back seams. Still didn't work. Gave it to my mimi me and she said it was too tight! She's 9. Might fit a toddler. So now my Talking Chewbacca has a Who hat.
2.0,ugly fringed on the bottom (I cut it off) and way too small...I'm small chested and it barely covered my boobs....only wore it once....
2.0,cheap looking and poorly constructed.<br />The elastic band that holds the pieces together are not even trimmed off.
2.0,I had these leggings for 3 days before they got a hole in them. I wore them to the gym once and they ripped. I‚Äôm very disappointed because I love the way the look but to have them for 3 days and only wear them once and to rip is a waste of money. I would like another pair or my money back.<br /><br />Brittany
2.0,Four pair in the pack. All same size but the black ones were a size it two smaller. I could wear the grey ones with no problem. Actually a little big (they will fall while walking. The black set was so tight could not even get them up.
2.0,"this had a HORRIBLE smell, and was way too short"
2.0,Im a tall 5'10&#34; and lean. I have a butt but I am not very big on my bottom half and they still did not fit. These pants are for VERY skinny girls and or girls not above 5'5&#34;
2.0,"Do not stay up for very long, from the beginning.  They are lovely looking but that will drive you crazy.  You have to dig deep into your boot to retrieve the top -- and then it slides down again!"
2.0,"If you really like big sunglasses and really want to cover more than your eyes, these are definitely not for you. I ordered the pink ones and they do not protect much from the brightness of the sun either. I will return tomorrow üò™"
2.0,"Fit VERY tightly. Did not try on the shirt but the hoodie was stiff and also kinda short. It also has a left sided zipper and that is an absolute no-no for me. Returned it, very disappointed."
2.0,Not satisfied with the way it‚Äôs constructed
2.0,"Though this is a very comfortable bra, it is not a bra that can be used for any high impact exercise."
2.0,"I returned this dress as i couldn't get in it nor could i walk in it. There is a zipper on the side, but it stops short of the top so it doesn't open fully. I could barely walk in this dress, which is not the way i like my dresses. It was very cute, but since i ordered 2 sizes bigger than i was and still couldn't move around or get in it without almost ripping it, i returned it."
2.0,"A very cute swim suit but way way too big. I followed the size chart and should not have. My daughter is 6, wears a size 7 so i ordered the XL as instructed by the size chart. Its more like a size 10-12. Its huge on her, theres no way she could wear it for at least 2-3 years. Im going to try and adjust it myself and make it fit by sewing it since returning it is such a hassle.<br />Other then the size the suit itself is cute and very mermaid like. Stretchy material. I wouldn't say hight quality but I wouldn't say its cheap either. I really wish it would have fit her. She has long red curly hair and is the perfect Ariel. Everyone at the pool calls her Ariel and this would have been perfect for her!<br />Hopefully I can tailor it to fit her and all will be well.<br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for unbiased honest review."
2.0,The dress is really cute. The sleeves are a little tight. Overall I'm happy with the dress but I'm currently deciding whether or not I should return it because the back is very loose. It fits awkward in that sense<br /><br />Edit: I decided to return it because the back was just way too loose/floppy
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:671a36a69510e67fd0a19ad938d36940]] I know the watch only cost 5 USD, I did not hope that it look and work like a top brand watch but my mom liked because looks very nice and I agree with that, looks nice as a bijouterie and accessory, but if you are looking for a cheap watch that works, this is not the one. I warned her that was too cheap to be good, but she insisted. So, I do not recommend this because it even worked, at least that would have been good. for the price."
2.0,The size 14 are much smaller than any other 14 I've come across. I would say they were more like a size 12.
2.0,Great when you first apply it but ascot 2 or 3 weeks later the vinyl started to peel off
2.0,Loved the suit but the bottom was too skimpy. Had to return it.
2.0,Item was distributed from China. Very small and cheap material .  will probably give this to my sister who is much smaller than me.
2.0,Hey they fell apart aftet 3 months. I am through buying any shoes or slippers from Amazon merchantd.
2.0,Product is alright quality isnt too amazing.
2.0,"Haven't really had much of a chance to use it.<br />Wore it, but temp didn't drop low enough to need to turn it on.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that the battery pocket feels awkward. It's in a normal pocket position.<br />So if you have  anything in your coat pocket, utility vest, or such, it gets uncomfortable."
2.0,"It's a nice watch, but I've wore mine four or five times and  because the band is really cheap it already looks old and nasty.<br />I would not recommend it."
2.0,Returned this item
2.0,"Very flimsy material, very wrinkly, and a little undersized."
2.0,"Appeared purple in the photo, came royal blue. Pretty but wrong color and huge. Won‚Äôt fit my teen"
2.0,2 out of 5
2.0,Feathers come out
2.0,It was a bit large for my head and didn't fit quite like the picture.  Also did not hold it's shape well.
2.0,"Post on one of the pairs of my earrings is crooked and looks like it'll easily end up breaking off. Other two pairs are ok, about what you'd expect for the cost. Disappointed about the third earring as it doesn't hang right when it's on due to the post not being placed on right."
2.0,"I was excited to get this and while it is almost true to size, the material is a spandex type of material so it hugs your midsection, and not flattering. It also came flawed with a few white discolorations ones the flesh colored part."
2.0,I ordered a men's 6.5 and got a women's 6.5
2.0,"It was nice for a while, then, it fell apart in my bag. Luckily no ink came out."
2.0,"The size completely is what I want for my fourth and fifth piercing.  The earrings came with a cute white leather box, which is pretty, but the earrings themselves seem don't worth its price and one of the earrings was out of shape when them arrived.  A little disappointing."
2.0,Runs big and the decal is very thick and uncomfortable
2.0,"I've only had the ring a few months and mine is heavily scratched. I'm not exactly a laborer, so this thing has seen light use. Inside is still nice and shiny, but the outside is completely marred and dull. I thought titanium was more resistant to this. Or, maybe it's just not titanium.<br /><br />Feels comfortable."
2.0,This is not leather.  Very dissapointed
2.0,"These masks came apart the first time I wore them, they are also very thick and hot."
2.0,"Feel a bit crooked, fragile and undependible.<br />...but get what ya pay for"
2.0,"For a size small the waist fit great (I have a 30&#34; waist) but the front thigh area was huge and looked like I was wearing a pillow case! For reference, my hips are 36&#34;. I've noticed that a lot of the newer clothes (tops, short, pants, jeans and even undies) the sizing is all wrong- too big or too small, just right here but not there. I have an average size body, or at least I think I do- 134 lbs, 38-30-36 and a lot of clothes by once trusted manufacturers are of poor quality and the sizes are wrong."
2.0,"These were all super cute and I was so excited to wear them. However every one of them the first day wearing, the dangly part broke off on all of them."
2.0,"Received this item and it worked as a zipper pull on my wallet., but the stone came right out as soon as I opened the package.  I had to reglue it in.  If it stays, I will keep it, if not am sending it back."
2.0,I consistently wear 2xl for the last 35 years.  This product is a full size and a half under.  Sending back unused and disappointed.  Overall look was good.  quality was okay.
2.0,Loved it at first but it fell apart after 2 months.
2.0,"Purchased the large, could not wear this with any larger than a b cup due to the cut of the seams. Very disappointing."
2.0,"I got this dress because I saw how stretchy the fabric was based on the reviewws, but what they failed to say was that the fabric is VERY THING -almost sheer like. It‚Äôs made out of the same material as sheer lingerie or something. I never post reviews but I honestly bought this dress because of how many positive reviews it had so I was expecting it to be amazing! It wasn‚Äôt. The dress is completely different in person, the material, and the length. The length is long but I use I would have to get it hem and I didn‚Äôt mind that part. But there‚Äôs a reason why this dress is cheap. Don‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,I am confused with the size..I use medium size..it says medium..but I found it too tight...just tried once...waste of my money..
2.0,A bit smaller than I was expecting. Didn't feel like it would work well for an adult. Very costume like. Fur is rough and has a slight smell.
2.0,This jumpsuit is transparent and not elegant on me. It‚Äôs more like a beach clothes
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture...The material is very cheap and highly resembles a Party City costume...that thin nylon material that imitation silk scarves are made of. Thank God for free returns.
2.0,"These are cute shoes but after my daughter wore these for a few hours, the seam is already splitting.  Giving 2 stars since I should have known better with them being so cheap."
2.0,returned as fit was just not right for me
2.0,"The jacket looks nice and cozy, but has a few shortcomings. My biggest gripe is the hoodie... it‚Äôs too tiny!!! My daughter looks comical when she wears it, and she is a 3 yr old who of course insists on wearing it. The zipper is also low grade, and the sleeve lining odd. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,"Unfortunately this broke the first day worn, see attached picture.<br /><br />The design is cute, but apparently there is not much glue or anything attaching the pieces, so it came off with no harsh movements, so I can not recommend it despite the good value and design."
2.0,Too small for DD cup
2.0,"They're cute earrings, but definitely look cheaper in person than in the Amazon photo. The photo makes these earrings appear as though the blue stones are set in silver, when in actuality it's cheap blue plastic. Basically, they look like plastic earrings with blue glitter smeared about, instead of the nice photo it portrayed on Amazon... not impressed..."
2.0,Okay Dress
2.0,"This product was very gaudy and cheap looking.  I'm sure the finish will come off soon, it is extremely cheap looking and I would not recommend this product. I am very dissatisfied."
2.0,"There is a lot of strange pouching in areas that make it impossible to wear under anything which is the opposite purpose of this bra. Great cleavage, terrible bra."
2.0,Cut is a little too small but overall I was pleased with the product.
2.0,"so weak! Ugh, wish i hadn't bought it, broke on my first wear. yes i know it's cheap - now i know why."
2.0,I had to return this item due to the fact it was nothing like the one depicted in the advertising.
2.0,"It's not as pictured above. The straps are much more sturdy and thick in the picture. The ones i received were very thin, like spaghetti straps, and my immediate thought when i unwrapped it was it looked like it was made for a child."
2.0,Look cheap. You get what you pay for I guess
2.0,Too small. It was for a gift
2.0,I feel the pictures were misleading and the price was to high for these little purses. I thought they would be bigger for my daughter to take to school and put items to in. These are more for going to the club with driver license and lipgloss
2.0,"Was disappointed with the thickness of these cups. They say they aren't padded, but the cup structure if very thick and very stiff. The cups are actually a bit too large.<br /><br />The only thing I did like was the small additional hook in the back so that the straps don't show with a tank top.<br /><br />I ended up with this Fantasie bra instead: Fantasie Women's Smoothing Seamless Balcony Bra 4520"
2.0,This dress is true to size and material is ok but unfortunately the color is NOT burgundy‚Ä¶ more like a light brown. The color is super dull and I‚Äôm not sure if my daughter can wear this to her school passing for burgundy.
2.0,"These were advertised as men sizes, so me being a woman and all, I ordered a few sizes smaller to fit my feet.<br />They do look great.l, honestly. The materials aren't cheap. The issue is, that while they fit my foot length-wise, they are ridiculously tight on the sides and the top of my foot. It took me 10 minutes to squeeze and wiggle my foot through. Mind you, i dont have a fat foot or anything. Once I got them on, yeah, it felt tight, but I figur3d maybe I can wear them in a bit. O.... M..... G..... I had a pain in my foot I don't think I have ever felt in my life, and believe me, I've had a lot of foot pain. It was like Chinese foot binding... Or what I assume it may feel like.<br />Unfortunately, I wore them so I won't be able to return them and it's too bad they're so tight because I really like the look of them. Oh well"
2.0,"Low quality belt, but the color is perfect, spot on. The elastic is cheap-feeling and not the strongest, but a compromise for a cute belt. Won't last long and won't really work all that well to hold up pants (it is meant as a waist belt anyways). It is the only off white belt with a gold buckle I could find that liked though. And it's cheap, so didn't loose much by buying this."
2.0,Wouldn‚Äôt purchase again. Poor quality but I didn‚Äôt pay much so I guess my expectations were higher because of their write up.
2.0,"Do not get this sweater. Looks nothing like the picture. In fact it‚Äôs a completely different sweater! I bought a small, white sweater thinking I was buying more of a tunic that was longer and draped over your bottom to pair with leggings but what I received was a short, waist-length sweater. And I wear small in about 99% of my tops so it wasn‚Äôt too small for me. Even the material looks different. I honestly think they sent me a different sweater than what I ordered. Nice looking sweater but it‚Äôs not what I thought I was buying based on the picture. I‚Äôm returning it."
2.0,Shranked after wash
2.0,"Legs too long, waist too tight. Missed the return window. Probably going to cut up and do something else with it."
2.0,"This is kind of a piece of junk. It‚Äôs very cute looking but the weave of the straw is very loose and the straw is brittle. It broke after 2 x of wearing it. The wind alone is enough to rip the eyelets that hold the chinstrap right through the straw. Of note, I purchased a similar hat in design made by billabong and the quality is much better, and at a very similar price point."
2.0,"Totally see through! The romper has a tag on the inside seam and you can see it plainly from the outside and all undergarments, even if they are nude colored. Also very &#34;short&#34;, meaning the romper does not work if you have a long waist/torso AND the short length is too short (booty showing)! I ordered a large to make sure it would fit my torso and I normally wear size 4/6. Still way short anyway you look at it!"
2.0,The material is NOT what you expect. It‚Äôs like swishy sweats material
2.0,The size is smaller than expected and do not fit properly. the are made cheep and ride on my feet funny. Won't be getting another pair of these.
2.0,Some came on broken but the rest ok
2.0,Shipping was quick... Own was as ordered... But it didn't come with anything to watch to collar... The ring it does come with is to also to fit on collar hook.. and I don't have a big dog or collar
2.0,My hands are small I brought size M and my hands are tide I can't move them
2.0,Neck on the medium is about a snug 16‚Äù
2.0,the toe box on these is too shallow.. It like a monkey mouth.  I ordered correct size but it was still to small because your feet will not reach the top so buy a larger size.  The toe area aweful.
2.0,This item fits like ‚ÄúJessica Rabbit.  Not a size 12-14 go bigger if you want to look stylish and comfortable.
2.0,"It is a pretty dress, but if you are &#34;hippy&#34; on the bottom it will not work well, but rather fit tight with the curves."
2.0,"Love this watch!!! Would definitely buy again if something happened to the one I have now. Watches are my things and this one is a really good one for the price. I had seen some of the last than stellar reviews, but I haven't had a problem with mine so far.<br /><br />Update.<br />My watch is barely working now. I went to put it on one day and I noticed it wasn't moving anymore. Had to change the date and time. Wore it for a while and it stopped again. Now it's just sitting in my watch case because it can't keep time. Very disappointed because I've only had it since April. Hence the decrease from 4 stars to 2."
2.0,First pair came without a lense. Returned for a new set. Both fit very wide for my 18 month old with a head in the 97%.
2.0,Bought a 2 pack and one of the pairs broke after just 1 use
2.0,Broke in a week. I'm not hard in my keys.
2.0,Had such high hopes for this shirt...and so disappointed. The fit is just odd. It‚Äôs big...but not big all at the same time! Weird...so back it went.
2.0,The flowers are blurry and the Large is more of a small/medium. The fabric is nice quality.
2.0,To small for an adult ankle
2.0,"Very low contrast dial. Seconds hand is dark blue on black background. Difficult to see. The numbers are very dim. Had to shine a flashlight on dial to get the watch to look like photo on Amazon page. The 24 hour hand is loose or skipping, worthless. This is the first watch I would tell people to avoid."
2.0,"Closures are not very good, otherwise good price."
2.0,"Bought size 18-24mo and it‚Äôs way too big, a 3yr old would fit in that."
2.0,"Now I understand why it was so i epensive.  Not a quality job, in my opinion."
2.0,The tail end of the Nike logo on the sleeve peeled off after a few months.  Not what I expected it to do.
2.0,"Ordered my size, but too small."
2.0,"I'm not sure I will keep them. They look very cute and are warm, comfortable, but they have a rubber sole with some type of a coating that makes a really strange sound on the floor. It sounds like someone is ripping a wax strip off, with each step I take... We have hardwood floor throughout the house and the dog can hear me from three rooms away and starts growling when I approach. Not ideal. Comfy as they are, I might have to return these."
2.0,"It looks really nice and I liked it, but mine broke within half a month after arrival. The leather tore apart while I was adjusting it on my wrist. I received many compliments on the watch prior to it breaking, though!"
2.0,"I wanted these to run with.  I know that gaiters aren't great masks, but I figured that I should be running in a mask of some sort as a pass people.  I like that it is long enough that I could fold it in half (if I wanted to have a double layer which they say is a more useful mask).  The problem is, folded in half or not, this gaiter doesn't stay up on my nose.  It is constantly falling down, leaving me to need to touch my face more.  I am really disappointed.  I have other gaiters that stay up without a problem.  I don't have a small face or head, so I would assume a lot of people would have this problem."
2.0,"Just like you would want in black studded earrings but horrible quality.  Looks like something you find in a gumball machine, needless to say i returned them for my money."
2.0,Bought a size small because I'm typically a small and this was awkwardly loose on the arms. Very thin material. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"While I love the design and the material - this runs small.  I ordered the 2XL but it fits like an XL..  Because it does not close, I will have to send it back. I really love it, but its just not fitting."
2.0,Not attractive to wear.
2.0,"The only thing good about this dress is the picture. The material felt like the child of newspaper and grocery bag. The double V necks are very low, rendering this dress inappropriate for office unless you like to layer. Now the fit runs a bit small. I'm 38D chest and the neck was gaping; not a good look. Overall, keep shopping, this ain't it."
2.0,"I purchased a size small and the fit was a little snug, but as I was pulling the dress down it tore in 3 different places.  I had to make a quick change before leaving for a friend's wedding. I will be returning for a refund."
2.0,I couldn't keep on my feet. Think it's my high in-step that was the problem. Gave them to a friend who loves them.
2.0,Gave this to my daughter as a birthday present about 4 weeks ago. She‚Äôs washed it three times and the graphic is starting to peel off. Not good quality.
2.0,Thinking that the mask was larger I bought this. It fits a small face like a child or petite woman features. It will not fit on a face mask for a medium to a larger woman face. It won't fit on a male face. Was a little disappointed.
2.0,I normally wear an Extra Large but this XL was too big
2.0,Not as long as expected and very large!
2.0,Very nice people but I don‚Äôt think they know the difference between linen cotton and polyester<br /><br />5x = size 12-14 maybe 16
2.0,"Ordered big because of the reviews, but was still too small. The back drops down very low and is tight so almost created a roll. Had a lot of side boobs which is not pleasant after having a child. Wish it would have fit its really cute. Im 5'3 150lbs ordered XL and did not fit."
2.0,This dress was made from thin cheap material... the pattern is beautiful and I loved the colors so I tried to make it work..but overall it didn‚Äôt fit or sit right anywhere.
2.0,At first they were gold. But after a week of wearing these they turned copper colored. Also the ring that resembles an &#34;X&#34; broke. I loved these rings but stopped wearing them because of the color.
2.0,My friend and I ordered the same dress which was supposed to have glitter and my friends did and mine had more of a rhinestone style. Not what I was expecting.
2.0,"Someone needs to learn how to measure! I wear a 46 waist and 32 length. These pants are 48-50 at most, the strings barely touch in the front! The length is 30 at best. The size description is way off!! I was so looking forward to wearing these while doing massage! Very disappointed!"
2.0,Did not fit well and I order up a size.
2.0,"Looked really nice, but It didn't work."
2.0,"It's a large but is tight on my 190 pound,  5'7&#34; frame."
2.0,"The first day I opened them, some of the color was chipping off the ear post. They are nice though, just don‚Äôt wear them for long days or you piercing will start to hurt."
2.0,They seem nice but run very small. I barely got them on.
2.0,"I was not crazy about this bathing suit whatsoever. It‚Äôs supposed to have tummy control, except for the fact that rouching doesn‚Äôt actually mean Control. It was a poor attempt to camouflage. There was too much stretch in the bathing suit even when I ordered my regular size. I am 5‚Äò7 , 140 lbs and I am generally a solid medium. My girls are also a 34DD, and this did nothing for them. No support whatsoever. Definitely returning this..."
2.0,"This ring looks lovely from a marketing perspective.  It is a comfortable and a sturdy ring; however, it does not look as perfect as the photo.  Mine has lots of flaws and imperfections on the ""underneath"" cross over.  The metal seems very bumpy, scored and not at all like the picture.  Very cheap ring.  You get what you pay for."
2.0,"I think these ties are a good idea, but they're just too small. They are either made for a child, or a short Oriental man/woman."
2.0,Sized oddly with smaller body and extra large arms. I'm not quite sure who this would fit.
2.0,"These jeans fit ok. They came with the name patch upside down. The company must not have a QA/QC department, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Comes in small, and looks like it shrink easily when washed. Had to give it a friend's daughter who could fit into it. Cute designs though."
2.0,"The bracelet looked tarnished, not like sterling silver. I bought 4‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ gave them to my young nieces who will probably lose them instead of co-workers."
2.0,"it was nice the first few times it was worn, but not even 3 months and the sides were getting cracked. like those plastic sides. now barely 3 months and its got a big tear on the inner side. i don't think the materials used were good enough. and to think it didnt even got worn in snow."
2.0,Item not as described. measures 40.5 Inches across when expanded. 13 inches long when collapsed. This is just your average umbrella nothing special.
2.0,Aravind very late. The size was too small. I got a xxl and was more like a small.
2.0,"These are for toddlers, or kids with extremely small heads. There is absolutely no stretch to these."
2.0,"I liked that they comfortably fit under clothes and were super warm.  However, the stitching in toe didn't make it past the first wearing."
2.0,Cheap and hardly looks like the photo. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
2.0,Size is a Little large. Doesn't fit I'm upper ear like I'm picture.
2.0,"It looked good, so I got it. I should have read the copy, better. It‚Äôs icky blend of spandex n ??  I had to wear a tank top, Under it because that fabric?? Rubs your naughty bits too much. It‚Äôs painful. Runs very large, too. It‚Äôs solid ice up here n I‚Äôm old, so to bring n  send back? Is expensive n dangerous to get to PO. So? I‚Äôm stuck with it. If u order it? It‚Äôs Not cotton OR, comfortable.  So, read carefully‚Ä¶.. unlike?! Dummy Me."
2.0,REALLY cheap material. Not a trench coat like I thought it would be.
2.0,"I'm mixed on these lenses. Haven't used them much so I can't comment on durability. They unfortunately don't fit tight in my mainlink glasses and rattle around. They worked great for fishing though, I could see fish in water 10 times better than with my naked eye. This brand is overpriced, there are plenty of the exact same lens for $15 on amazon."
2.0,"I love the pattern and the color. The material itself is really thin, easily wrinkled, and see through. If it was a thicker material I would have kept it. I ordered a large b/c of my chest size, but usually wear a M.  The product was a bit large. It wasn‚Äôt short b/c I‚Äôm 4‚Äô10."
2.0,"I am sensitive to fake metals and certain metals. This caused an infection after just 2 days. If you are sensitive to certain metals or fake metals like me, this is not the way to go. I had to put my stud back in and by the next day my infection had already cleared up considerably."
2.0,This shirt was HUGE in the waist but also super short. It's a very thick cotton material so it doesn't drape well at all. Will be returning.
2.0,"Although these gloves seem to be well made, they were useful for cold protection only to about 40 degrees F.  Fingers got very cold bicycle riding at 25-35 degrees F."
2.0,"It's very pretty. I am a 36B so I ordered a 36B. However, the bra size is most definitely NOT a 36B. Way too tight! Aside from sizing issue, it is lovely."
2.0,So thin it is see-through. The second day we had it the coat ripped. By the fourth day the buttons were broken. I am returning it.
2.0,I bought L and the size was too small. It feels like size S or XS.<br />The design and material are ok. But be careful with size buy 2 grades larger.
2.0,"I gave it two stars because at least it is mostly cotton. Other than that, it is very disappointing. The decal is literally like paper stuck to the sweatshirt. I don't expect it to wear well or hold up. The decal is also very large in proportion to the size of the sweatshirt. I will probably be returning this..."
2.0,Mens size was xl but fit small. Womans was a small but way to big!!
2.0,"Although this set is very pleasing to the eye, they tarnished within the first year of owning them. Please note I didn't wear them every day. Also, you'll find yourself turning them constantly so that the sparkles show."
2.0,Did not fit well and kep rolling sown which was embarrassing
2.0,"As soon as I got it I decided to return it. While it sorta looks like a cool wallet, there are a few key things that were different from the pictures. First, the coloring is definitely off (I've attached some pics, but even they don't totally do it justice #batmanpuns); the images in the listing make it look like the gray is a bit brighter, but in reality it's a pretty dark gray. Second, the pleather on the inside seems pretty cheap, and I have a pretty big fear that it'll start to disintegrate after a little bit of use; I can't totally back that up with evidence, as I returned it immediately upon receiving it, but it's a strong suspicion. I really want to love this wallet, but it just doesn't seem great. If you're fine with those things, it's probably great for the price."
2.0,"It's a cute jumpsuit, but totally see-through."
2.0,"Update: Reduced rating from 4 to 2-star, because at 3 months after purchase, the rim has really yellowed badly - to the point of being annoying every time I pull out my phone. The yellowed antique-look really does not match the phone.<br /><br />Review 1 month in: Good if you want to keep the iphone look and are willing to have less-than-bullet-proof protection, but i knew that at purchase. I have the completely clear version. I used it with tempered glass screen cover and am fairly careful with my phone, so I think it's a trade-off that works for me. The phone survived one drop from 3 feet to tiled floor without damage. Interesting side-benefit is that alert flash (I've set my phone to flash with an alert Settings&#62;General&#62;Accessibility) is transmitted to clear rim on front of phone - kind-of cool effect. Perhaps some slight yellowing of clear rim in 2 mo (not sure)."
2.0,"I was really excited to get this jacket, but it took over a month to receive and when I finally got it the color was sooo disappointing. It isn‚Äôt a vibrant yellow like in the photos and looking at the stitching it just didn‚Äôt look like the same jacket. Sad it isn‚Äôt like the photo. I posted the photos from seller and then the disappointing pale ugly yellow I received. Returning!"
2.0,Cute print and style but material does not stretch. Ordered 6x but looks more like 3-4T and that is before washing.
2.0,"I‚Äôll start by saying that they fit as expected, and are true to size. I ordered the black ones and first thing I noticed is that they weren‚Äôt very thick at all. I put them on and they aren‚Äôt see through when I‚Äôm standing but if I bend over or do a squat these pants are see through. I was hoping they‚Äôd be thick enough to do squats in and handle intense workouts but these are not the pants for that. I‚Äôll probably just wear them with a long top to run errands in. Disappointing."
2.0,Reviews said order down. Do not! Order your normal size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and they were too short in Medium.
2.0,"It was nothing like the picture. Took it out of the package and it was just a rectangle. No sewn ruching. The neck draping is an unfinished flap you have to tuck in and hope it stays down. The arms are not 3/4, they were an uncomfortable length. The fabric was not soft, either, and unfinished threads were hanging from the side. Only getting two stars because the color was exactly as pictured."
2.0,"Quality was not good, it was beautiful when I first put it on, but after just a few hours , the chain was black and it left a black residue on my neck. I threw it away."
2.0,Nice looking shirt and fits well but the collar is huge!
2.0,This pack of 3 men's tank tops run small. I ordered a large which is my sons true to size and they are too small. Returning them.
2.0,"Too tight! It ""grabs"" in the crotch area and the legs ride up"
2.0,"This is my second Le Mou  blouse.  I love the first one and it fits well so I ordered this shirt -- a slightly different style -- in the same size.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though it was the exact same size as the other Le Mou blouse this one was so tight I couldn't comfortably move my arms.  Back it went!"
2.0,They were smaller than I ever thought.will past them to someone that is Abel to wear them
2.0,"I'm going to give 2 stars only because I received my delivery in time. For one, the rings were everywhere when I opened the box. When I put them in the slots, 2 rings are missing. This is for my DAUGHTER'S bday & the reason I purchased is because the image shows a bunch of girly rings. I got spiderman, angry bird, xmas trees, some weird green things (a total of 16 I will not use!) EXTREMELY UPSET"
2.0,Not worth the money. They didn‚Äôt fit well they would sag down on the top of the butt area. I had my daughter try who was smaller and she didn‚Äôt like either.
2.0,Purchased it for my daughter it runs very large. Overall nice style
2.0,They make everything too blue for my liking. However quality is great. I have other sunglasses from these guys and love them.
2.0,"The quality of the cami‚Äôs was good, but I just did not like the style. The sleeves are too long, and the overall fit was just not right."
2.0,After a while they start to fall of your head while you are sleeping  . It doesn‚Äôt stay on my head. It became too losr.
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture once you have it on.
2.0,It‚Äôs way too big. Don‚Äôt know how to exchange the product.
2.0,The ball at the end took forever to get off then it came off while I was wearing it.
2.0,"This might have been a five star review, but there was a major manufacturing error with the pair I received. The lace is supposed to be on the outer side of both legs, but in this case, mine had the lace on the inner side of the right leg. I'm going to have to take the bottom part of the messed up leg off and sew it back on the right way I suppose."
2.0,I like the ring because of the materials used. I liked the message. Per the measurement chart I got that size and it was too big. Ive gotten another size smaller but it is still slightly too big but there was no size 8 available.
2.0,Color is great - I really wasn't purchasing for any heavy coverage - I just wanted something as a casual coat.  This thing is very thin but also shapeless and way too long.  I am 5'4&#34; so if you are super tall it may work but I wasn't expecting it to cover down to my mid-calf and be shapeless.  Not a great look.
2.0,"I wanted to love these, but first off I ordered 4 of them for my bridesmaids for a just in case they need some warmth after our wedding in January. Well I ordered 3 different sizes and they are literally all the same size. 3 off them are poor quality and a dark grey and the one that was actually good quality was the small and it was huge and a light grey. So get what ya pay for I guess."
2.0,Cute but the one I ordered hurt my ankle.
2.0,"This belt is very odd. I am 5'6 and wear a size 4-6. This belt, apparently, is way to small for me! The beading only goes around half my waist. So the other half is just the rope which looks silly!! Such a disappointment. Pretty belt, I just don't know why the beaded part is so small!!!"
2.0,"The necklace was simply lovely and I truly enjoyed wearing it!  BUT that was short lived.  It tarnished very very quickly to the point I was barely able to wear it and now can't anymore.  :-(<br /><br />As for the seller - they were great!  Just the product itself leaves a bit to be desired, but then again you pretty much get what you pay for."
2.0,"These don't hold me up well, and I am not top heavy at all. I do like the ease of being able to nurse in them when not using a nursing bra, but they just don't provide enough support for me."
2.0,Thin cheap fabric. Extremely narrow shoulders. Regret purchase.
2.0,"I like the style of this shirt and the fabric is very soft. But after a few washings the fabric is showing wear and the surface has developed those annoying little lint balls. I only air dry after washing, so this fabric should hold up better. I‚Äôm disappointed. China manufactured fabric/clothing tends to be cheap."
2.0,The quality was not good at all. And the way in which the feathers were sewn together looked very cheap!
2.0,"These fit like skinny jeans look.<br />I'm an old guy, don't want tight fitting anything."
2.0,The second time using my bag today the zipper broke. It's great with all the pockets but so cheaply made. Really disappointed with it.
2.0,"I‚Äôm honestly let down by these pants. I expected it to fit more huggingly to my body but instead it looks though as if I‚Äôm wearing garbage bags. It‚Äôs a nice concept I just wish I knew it ran big, but I‚Äôm really disappointed by this. The straps help somewhat but the pants fall down so much it looks weird trying to tighten the straps. What sucks is they don‚Äôt grey in size small. Also the material is weird, but maybe ironing it will help"
2.0,The blue in it is not as vibrant as it shoes on the picture. A little too thin for my liking.
2.0,Returned due to size issue
2.0,"I want a fan of how cheap th he fabric looked and felt. I also felt like the seam between the pattern and black wasn't sewn straight and looks crookdd to me. I could be wrong,  but I am not a fan of this shirt or how it looks."
2.0,Way too short in the front....
2.0,"If your hoping to use this to capture video, there is no live monitoring, so your basically shooting blind. The camera also ate one of my memory cards and it will not come out. It's extremely light so it will be effected by the wind and the manual is written so poorly it took me 2 days plus online research to get it to work. I gave it 2 stars because if you just want a drone to play around with, cool go for it. If you want something that youd like to take coordinated pictures and videos with, look elsewhere."
2.0,"Fabric is fine, but this is definitely not my style with a cape in the back."
2.0,I am between small and medium normally so I got a medium that fit like a large. The shoulders made me look like a quarterback. Just a wierd fit overall.
2.0,This is a thick jacket
2.0,"Was so excited because I love buying new watch bands for my watch. When I would try to fit it on for the part that goes on the top section kept coming undone and my watch would slip till I realized the little magnetic piece was missing so I wouldn‚Äôt hook on properly, kinda bummed about that"
2.0,I was very disappointed when I tried putting it on my prescription glasses that it didn't fit because it was made too small.
2.0,"I was disappointed to come back and see when I purchased these. I only wear them briefly in the morning and then around the house during the evening. Rarely have I brought them outside to grab things out of the truck or mail. They have really only seen a moderate amount of use. Unfortunately they began falling apart two months ago, about 6 months after buying them. And due to the low usage they incur, it took the last two months for me to finally bite the bullet and buy a new pair today. I did not buy these again. I bought some for 1/4 the price else where. I would suggest you do the same."
2.0,I like the fabric - it doesn't get too hot or sweaty.  But I am constantly tightening it because it seems to loosen back up or it just keeps stretching too much.
2.0,The quality was great but sizing was way off. We purposely ordered a bigger size and it was still way too small.
2.0,"As others have stated, this item runs extremely small. The only reason I ordered it is because I'm having surgery and needed a cheap, white, long-sleeved top with a hood. This is not even close to white. It's not even close to cream. It's more like a yellowish, beige color. I'll keep it since I need it ASAP, but I'm hoping to stretch it out as quickly as possible. Luckily, I don't need this for anything special or important and it was cheap. But it's NOT white."
2.0,And I also ordered too small
2.0,Disappointed in the colors on this hat-the picture shows a lighter charcoal hat with black lettering.  The actual hat is almost black and you can hardly read Jeep on it.
2.0,"I didn't start wearing this until a couple of weeks after I received it. And after a few weeks of wearing it, the clasp will come undone and fall off. This has happened several times that I just decided to return it for a replacement but by that time, the return window had expired a week earlier. Not very happy."
2.0,This jumper isn't made of stretchy material.  Buy a size up...
2.0,"Not happy with my purchase and I can't even return them. They are not made well and the tint is not how it is displayed in the image, you can completely see my eyes rather than just a little."
2.0,"The fit is small and it very giving. It's not bad enough to return, but I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"I love foxes and thought this would be so fun to try! The band is SO cute, but it looks like the design was printed on some thin material and then glued to the band. So it doesn't seem very durable or secure. Also, the band is just wrapped around a little bar and glued to secure.  And that bar is what is inside the connector (the one that actually attaches to the watch) and is really wobbly and popped right out when I was attaching it to my watch. So cute, but I returned it. :("
2.0,Way to thin.
2.0,"It‚Äôs a beautiful costume, but the zipper broke the second time I zipped it up. It‚Äôs super tight on the chest, so if you have breast larger than an A, get a size larger. It‚Äôs too bad it broke - it‚Äôs a very realistic replica."
2.0,"Clip too small and thin, broke and had to attach another to Make lanyard usable again."
2.0,Bought theIs dress and immediately returned. Too was too small and bottom was way to big. I'm 5'3 about 145 and a 34c. The top was way too small I was afraid of my boobs falling out or having a nip slip. The length was perfect right above my knee. The bottom half of the dress was way too big.  The fabric and color I loved.
2.0,See through tights when worn
2.0,Shoes had a hole in them in less than a month. Not good quality.
2.0,The fit was fine. But the rubber seperated from the top of the toe within the first two weeks. When you spend that kind of money on your 5 yr olds shoes you expect them to at least last through the next growth spurt!
2.0,"I ordered the large and it's too small, it would probably fit a youth."
2.0,"size chart didnt match, needed to go up 2 more sizes..."
2.0,"Very fragile. Zipper broke in first day! Zipper comes apart easy. I had to sew it back, and attach new zipper head. Works otherwise."
2.0,"The item is beautiful! BUT, the drop down menu says gold and I didn't realize that meant rose gold. Disappointed its not yellow gold. Other than that, it's very pretty, I love the sparkly face."
2.0,Flimsy construction
2.0,"These are very cute and fit my 10 year old daughter's ears perfectly.  However, she doesn't have sensitive ears and she has had two infections since she has been wearing them.  Also, it appears that some of the pink stones have come loose and they have fallen out.  They also did not stay closed in the beginning.  I kinda had to bend the two ends closer together to get the latch to stay locked in place.<br /><br />I am waiting for her ears to clear up and I am going to try these again.  However I am already searching for another pair of earrings in case she gets another infection."
2.0,"The fabric feels like cheap bed sheets, and the product arrived unbuttoned, wadded up, and wrinkled with no tags. Looks very much like it‚Äôs second-hand. Fits just slightly smaller than expected, still adequate. Photo makes it look less structured and more comfortably fitting."
2.0,"Had to change my review. Bought these the end of November and by middle of January, they had a hole next to the rear seam. Super disappointed because I love the fit of these jeans."
2.0,"Way smaller than expected -- my thumb would not even fit in the thumb opening.  Also, the palm padding seemed much thinner than expected."
2.0,They look lovely but are way too heavy!
2.0,Not made well.  I love the print of the material...but the fit is terrible.  I will probably use the material to make a dress for my little Chihuahua.
2.0,The dress itself is absolutely beautiful! That said I ordered a dress for a 2-3 years. This is what I got. The dress fit my friends 6 yr old! Needed the dress for a 1st birthday party and pictures and will now have to rush to find a replacement.
2.0,"I love the outfit,looks cute on..  but, not really good quality.  , shorts are way to large! And the seams on the short came out on 3 rd wear.. so I am not imPressed !<br />I would not purchase again.."
2.0,It is super cute and the colors are awesome. My main complaint is that 2 right 'push-up' cups were put together (one side pushes the breast up and the other side pushes the  breast down) to make the top. It def is weird and I guess I can only wear it around my pool.
2.0,Fit well. Did not like. Was expecting 2. Only received 1.
2.0,"Not as much support as thought, threading is coming loose and have not wore the sandals anywhere but around the house. Some what of a disappointment."
2.0,"These boots literally scuffed the first time my daughter wore them. The cheap ones I bought from target held up better than these. Unfortunately , I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"Sandals were great for a few weeks, my son loved them. Then the Velcro stopped working after just a few weeks of normal wear. I‚Äôve tried cleaning them and still no luck. Unfortunately I checked the return policy one week too late. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you want a pair of sandals that will last the summer."
2.0,"Wouldn't buy it again, but I'll wear it with my swimsuit i guess"
2.0,"It's a great looking shirt, however it looks like.an extra large shirt for a 10 year old kid. A big disappointment."
2.0,These plugs are actually WHITE/CLEAR. They're NOT soft and flexible. They're NOT easy to get in. I'm giving them 2 stars because they actually arrived on time.
2.0,It's way to big. I'm 5'2  and 130 lbs and I got a medium. It's super long.  Goes past my knees and looks like I'm wearing some big tarp.<br /> It's nice material and I wish I ordered a small.<br />I ordered it for a birthday party and probably not gonna wear it now. Sucks.  Even with a belt it's too big. This picture does it major justice. I've been so excited to get my dress and now I'm super bummed...I can't even afford to buy another for the party. So wish I got a small:(
2.0,"UPDATE: One of these has already broken. Check frequently for loss of integrity in coil.<br /><br />The coil seems to have been yanked out of the mold with out any finishing. There are rough edges and threads of plastic hanging off.<br />If you have extremely large wrists, they may feel snug."
2.0,"Pretty color, but too tight"
2.0,This was not what I expected. The front part is turned so that the bottom of it is attached to the back along the side. This makes it hang strangely. Returned it.
2.0,"My five year old LOVED this shirt when we saw it and upon receiving it.  After washing it once, it no longer fits.  The length of the shirt is considerably shorter and he can no longer wear it.  We were both disappointed about this.  I would not recommend this particular shirt.  I followed the instructions so I assume it is poor quality."
2.0,Its a beautiful anklet. However it broke after wearing it for just over a week. They should replace it since now I can't even fix it to wear it.
2.0,Product arrived fast but unfortunately these leggings will sag and won't stay snug at your waistline. These were cheap for s reason.Lucky for me my moms a seamstress and can fix this unfinished product
2.0,"The design is really cute, and it came quickly. However, I ordered a size ""medium"". Based on the size chart this should have been a size 7-8 shirt, and as you can see from the tag on the shirt it was labled as a size 5 (not even ""small"" or ""medium"", as listed)<br />Luckily, I had ordered it to be large on my child so the 5 will work, but I was expecting a bigger shirt."
2.0,The masks arrived in a timely manner. The masks are entirely too thick to wear in warm climates.
2.0,"Seem durable.  Nice fit, but get more reflection and glare in these than in glasses without the glare coating. Will only wear when desperate."
2.0,Very thin but cute; would‚Äôve been good if twice the thickness; unfortunately returned
2.0,"The watch is bigger than I expected, it also weigh 3 oz.  I don't it doesn't sound like a lot, but if it's clipped to a purse or bag that's pretty much extra weight"
2.0,The bottoms have no elastic and sag extremely!!!!! Can not use the bottoms!
2.0,The bread are actually really cute but WAY TOO SMALL and I ordered an XXL
2.0,Did not like this at all. Understood that it would be kinda thin (its linen) but still it barely provides any kind of wind block. Most annoying this is the weird stiff collar around the head and arm holes.
2.0,"I received an entirely different style of boot than originally ordered. Apparently, they labeled incorrectly by the seller who didn't really seem to care.<br /><br />Since I received these boots, I can review what I did get. They're not &#34;true fit&#34; as advertised. Thay do run large. Personally, I thought they were very uncomfy to wear and offer no support. Not worth the selling price. Cheaply made with all faux materials.They're basically cheaply made imported boots."
2.0,"The ear piece came off because the rivet broke off while in my glass case, so they are no good to me."
2.0,These stockings were two different colors of purple and two different width of stripes.
2.0,These got stuck in my ear for 3 days!!
2.0,I returned this because I didn't like the fabric of the skirt.
2.0,This dress is made out of t shirt type material.  It's going back.
2.0,The one size fits all is too large and  shapeless  for me. Others may like it but I feel it was not a flattering cut
2.0,way too small.  I don't even think this would fit my 12 year old niece.
2.0,Would be a very nice dress but it was too small. I ordered an XL and normally wear a Large
2.0,"They look attractive on photos, but the metal appeared to be slightly bended inside and the item's overall quality didn't meet my standards. It is appropriate for beginners or for practice purposes."
2.0,I guess my ear is odd or something but this thing fits sooo awkward. Its practically unusable for me. It's a cool little piece though. Just hope it fits right or it'll be a pretty desk ornament like mine is.
2.0,"The pants are great but the fabric the shirt is made out of is the same as the pants, I‚Äôd rather have a cotton shirt. The shirt is cut small and the fabric is not very lite or airy so it tends to be clingy and uncomfortable."
2.0,"they are not good quality, very thin, and do not have a good quality feel to them. I would not suggest them. they do not wash well, they come out of the washer and dryer very wrinkled. I did not send them back, too much trouble, but I would not buy them again."
2.0,"Got very uncomfortable after a few weeks of wear, started digging in my back and became bent and out of shape"
2.0,Could use a softer felt. Leaves scuffs on leather boots.
2.0,While the bag is just what I was looking for i am very disappointed that it is already falling apart after less than 2 months. Either the bag is faulty or the quality isn't that great.
2.0,More for 12-18 months.
2.0,"Beads are strung on a cheap thread. The metal &#34;U&#34; is extremely narrow and cheap. Looks as if it would bend easily. It will work for costume jewelry, but not much more than that."
2.0,Would have been nice it it fit. I got a 3X although I wear a 1X. The advert saya fit smaller so I thought getting a larger sixe would compliment. It did not unfortunatly.  I really liked the look and the material was perfect.
2.0,"El dise√±o de la camiseta no es de muy buena calidad, le falta color a la imagen y mejorar el dise√±o. Adem√°s tenia un olor muy fuerte y no exactamente a ropa nueva."
2.0,Cute but had to give it to my daughter... She is 7 and the small fits her perfectly. I would try ordering at least 2 sizes up.
2.0,"I just looked &#34;Dowdy&#34; in it. Beautiful and it fit, it just didn't flatter me at all. It was also way too long on my 5'3&#34; frame. I'm 90.7Kg so it works well for plus sizes."
2.0,The socks are no where the size shown or s stated. I wear 11 and they barely fit and come up just past my ankles. Very disappointed.
2.0,Too small for IPhone 6
2.0,Love the shirt the feel but it was too small I ordered a 2X and it would equal a medium.
2.0,"I absolutely loved these bracelets. Someone purchased it for me as a gift. However, both broke within 1 week of wear. Not secured properly to bangle. Sad about them breaking."
2.0,This isn‚Äôt a true apron. It‚Äôs like a thin sheet of cloth. This is the package it arrived in. The size of a sandwich baggie but thinner. Not worth the price. It should be $1. I would return it but I need something Christmas to wear at my dinner tomorrow.
2.0,This mask barely fits. The strings aren‚Äôt easily tightened or loosened so it falls off your face and the actual mask part is really small. I bought this mask as a joke because it‚Äôs like a gimp mask but it didn‚Äôt even fit well enough for a joke because I had to awkwardly balance it on my face.
2.0,More like a work shirt
2.0,The earrings were cute when they came in but the bigger hoops with the two rows of rhinestones were hard to open. then when I put them in they wouldn‚Äôt xclose and one of the hooks actually bent to the point of almost breaking. Not worth the money
2.0,Ordered kids and they are adult size
2.0,The fabric gets bad too fast.
2.0,The dress would've been so cute. But extremely short for my taste. It just barely covers my butt. I suppose it could be worn at a tunic but I'm returning it.
2.0,Good quality band for a great price. Fits and looks nice.UPDATE: I lost my Garmin because the pins that hold the band in place are slightly narrower than the Garmin bands and are easily pulled away detaching the band from the watch.
2.0,Great looking bracelet but came apart in few days.<br />I don't even know if it can be fixed. I wish they were made more durable.
2.0,great concept but feels cheap and unstable. handle bars bend
2.0,I have a thin 6 year old and got the small size that says it's for 5-6 year Olds and he couldn't even put it on it was so small. Good quality materials but WAY too small.
2.0,Meh. It's ok.
2.0,Bought this sweater for a Christmas party and was so excited to get it. Very disappointed in the color. It is burnt orange. It is NOT red at all.
2.0,Too small and very tight. Would be good for a child‚Äôs wrist NOT an adult‚Äôs wrist
2.0,sizing was weird
2.0,It was not what I expected.  The fabric was thin and it came in a tiny bag.
2.0,"Love the color,  on the small side."
2.0,The skirt I ordered is not what arrived. I ordered a black skirt with pockets in a size medium. What I got was a side zip size 2 skirt from Nine West. The skirt is lovely but a size 2 is never a medium and it does not have pockets.
2.0,Not the quality I was expecting for the price... Thin material.... Very sheer....
2.0,"when i open the package the dress was just rolled up and the zipper undo. So it gave me the impression that someone else had used it...the bow on the shoulder flops down, it can hold up. The fabric is very thin, polyester made..."
2.0,Nice color. Didn‚Äôt like the collar or the tightness of the fit in the chest. I have an athletic build
2.0,Not very high. Don't like the length. Cute pattern.
2.0,"Way too long, my husband wears 30 inseam and 30 waist. And these came down 3 inches too long. Have to return....ugh"
2.0,"Very nice looking charm.  To be quite honest it is as beautiful as the picture.  But, it it NOT sterling silver. It is silver plated.  after a few weeks I noticed it was turning a copper color.  Would not have bought it if I had known."
2.0,The robe itself was ok.  Soft and fits ok.  But the pink tie for the whole robe is NOT what you would expect from paying for a robe like that.  It's a craft ribbon!  Like you would use for a toddlers ponytail!  Not made of the same fabric that the robe is made from.  I gave it to my girls to play with because it was fraying on the ends and was disappointed to see that is what they put as the sash for the robe!  Was thinking of returning it but don't think I'll go through the hassle.
2.0,One of the clips wouldn't stay shut after only using these a couple of times. Spend a few dollars more to get something just a little nicer. These are just too cheap to perform
2.0,Cute dress...too bad it shrunk after washing in cold and air drying? Now it's above the ankles and tight across the hips...no longer the flowey dress it was before I washed.
2.0,I felt like this shirt was a little tight for a medium. It was a little difficult to get my arms in and then the shoulder/arm area was tight. Returned same day.
2.0,Ok  earrings... Only thing is the stones fell out after 2 weeks.... It wasn't worth returning.... I still wear them.... You can't really tell ..I have long hair... I managed to put new stones in.... I was a little disappointed when they fell out.... I don't think I would order them again.....
2.0,No me agrad√≥ es peque√±o como un dimes
2.0,Its not what's in the picture. Clearly in the picture its softer and more flowing. Its actually stiffer and looks cheaper. I'll keep it just because of the price
2.0,"Great concept, but the sticky doesn‚Äôt stick well so they keep falling off."
2.0,"Product arrived with a scratch on the front, but since I ordered the product about a month before my wife's birthday, I missed the return window, which I did not realize was only 30 days."
2.0,"The PJ's are thin and shrink in the legs roughly 4 -5 inches when washed. They are very cute but now very short. I am 5'9"" tall and although very thin material fit well for only the first time. After washing my family constantly asks me, when wearing these PJ's, if I am expecting a flood :-)"
2.0,Only had for a few months before it broke.  Lucky I felt it pop and that my Apple Watch face didn‚Äôt break.  Beautiful band but quality is subpar
2.0,Even ordered a size up and too small.
2.0,I'm an XL; I even bought an XXL and it still fits like a slim-fit XL. Eeesh.
2.0,"I really liked this, but it has broken after 1 year if wear.  It cost too much to have to replace every year."
2.0,the fabric is cheap and the turban is skimpy!
2.0,Finish came off.
2.0,"This dress was a little see through, and did not come with that matching blue belt.<br />Update: Seller very kindly fixed the belt issue with partial refund."
2.0,Very pretty but shows every ounce of flab
2.0,"Pretty thin, not awesome quality. I‚Äôm a trainer and love a great legging, unfortunately these aren‚Äôt them."
2.0,"Not what I expected. Purchased for my Mom to wear around the house but uncomfortable because it needs constant adjusting. Soft, silk like material rides up, very thin. Cool wash, hang dry. I wouldn‚Äôt dare put it in the dryer."
2.0,If you pull the pants way up its a little better but still uncomfortable.
2.0,Nice color. Extremely see through. Picture does not show hope revealing chest area is. Huge opening under the tie. Not been for women with D chest.
2.0,I‚Äôm 36dd and I ordered a large. I spilled out of the sides. I gave 2 stars for the material being soft.
2.0,"Not very impressed, 2 stones loose in the pkg, size was questionalbe, overall didn't work for me"
2.0,"I expected thin material but this felt cheaper than expected. I didn't sent back because I thought I'd wear it under a blazer or something similar. Went to put it on one day and realised the straps had broken so really flimsy and cheap. Can't return now, as I am past the date for return."
2.0,"I didn't like the sleeves you could see my bra, I top part didn't give me much coverage and  I'm a 34B."
2.0,"I HAD NOT WORN THE WATCH ABOUT 4 MONTHS AFTER I RECIEVED IT.ON MY FIRST TIME WEARING IT I HAD WIND IT ABOUT 7 WINDS,THE WATCH WOULD RUN FOR ABOUT 2HOURS AND STOP.NOW ITS A JEWELRY COLLECTOR."
2.0,not great
2.0,Loved the look of this lanyard however the durability was lacking. It is not made to withstand the hands of little ones. It will break with the easiest tug.
2.0,"Much shorter than the picture. Also the hood was really tight and looked incredibly weird. Overall it just has the wide, short style that isn't flattering"
2.0,"The sweater is soft, warm and seems well-made. Ordered it Dec 4 for Christmas; it didn't arrive until Jan. 17. It was a 2XL, but was much too small (more like a L). Would have been costly to return it. They offered to return $6 of the $22 cost and I could keep sweater. Not a concession I was happy with but I settled knowing I wouldn't order from them again. I usually read reviews of sellers, but didn't with this one. Shame on me."
2.0,Item is looks nothing like picture . Different color and style
2.0,"You know when you pull something out of the Amazon package and you just immediately laugh a little bit and hope that it isn't as bad as it looks? This was almost worse. It's way too big and really just looks like a circus tent with a tie. Which would ordinarily be within my style wheelhouse! But it's quirky in a cheap material, poor construction kind of way, rather than the effortless babydoll way that you hope that it's going to be."
2.0,Fit very well and print is so cute but the fabric looks and feels cheap up close so I‚Äôm returning it.  It does look cute on curvy girls though.  It just feels like it would be really hot in the summer
2.0,Very short in the waist. I use it under other shirts only.
2.0,"They were very cute, however the lace part ripped the first time I wore them."
2.0,I received this last Monday and gave to my husband as part of his birthday yesterday and the battery is dead. The warranty says it dors not cover batteries and I don't feel like I should have to pay return shipping when it came to me with a dead battery. My husband and I like the look of it but I feel this should be addressed in a positive manner.
2.0,"Straps are well made and look nice, however, if you're buying these thinking they are leather as described they are NOT!  Although in the photo it shows the inside rough as leather would appear they are actually two pieces of identical glossy vinyl sewn together. Thus, I only rated two stars due to the misrepresentation in description and photo. I returned them and was credited for the amount paid but not the return postage, thankfully Amazon nicely covered the postage as a credit."
2.0,"cheaply made, but at least it's cute."
2.0,chain was very jeap
2.0,The description says that these have tummy control and pockets!  That was the whole reason I ordered these!!!!!! They are just high waisted and NO POCKETS!!!! It‚Äôs so frustrating!
2.0,"They were pretty, but much too big! I returned these."
2.0,Bad quality‚Äôs
2.0,"Very thin, more like an undershirt type material."
2.0,"I bought this dress for my birthday and instantly fell in love with it.  It arrived on time as expected, however, the shaw/ top piece was difficult to navigate.  The neck line was odd and threw the entire dress/ look off.  i tried multiple ways to fix it, but they didn't work.  I returned the item with no issues."
2.0,"It was a big brighter than I was expecting, the picture shows a dark navy even after reading. So its a more Royal Blue. Didnt work for me."
2.0,"Follow up to original review 06/12:<br />Within a short amount of time the chains got darker and darker. Didn't clean well. Myself I'm not going to clean jewelry to wear it every 2 days. But, you get what you pay for. Next time I purchase a snake chain it will be guareeted 925 sterling silver and stamped<br /><br />Well, it does say it's 925 sterling silver, but there's no 925 stamp anywhere on it. I have a tendency of putting certain jewelry on and keeping it on. Had for a few days now, just looks like I've had it on for a few days. Nothing bad. Can't help to be somewhat skeptical because for the price you get three of them. I wanted 18"" and I got 3 20""."
2.0,didnt look good on me
2.0,Upon opening this package I realized the jewelry was really ugly! There was only one out of the 5 that was decent. They are way oversized and not what I expected at all.
2.0,"These shorts are a nice length, but the legs are wide. They are comfortable to wear around the house, but the t-shirt-like fabric is thin and shows every little thing, making them unflattering."
2.0,"Did not know it came directly from China.  Took forever and a day.  Much smaller than anticipated.  Hope it stays on the hood of the car... it glues on, no bolts."
2.0,Husband bought for the gym. He is very muscular and wears an XL but this tank had ridiculously long straps. I've never seen ab cleavage but he had it along with inappropriate nipple incidents. The length was like a short dress so his legs looked short. He likes the image so we re going to try to sew the straps or something. I would buy a size smaller for sure but think the straps would still be long. I would not buy again and do not recommend.
2.0,"Nicely made and the fabric feels nice, but the proportions are really strange. I bought these for my 5 year old and the 4/5s are more the length of a size 6, which was great for him since he is tall and skinny and the waist on size 6s are usually way too big for him. These have an elastic waist. I thought this would work out perfect, but they were WAY too tight. I have no idea who these pants could actually fit. Also, it doesn't look like it in the picture but while the legs are skinny the upper part of the pants is oddly baggy and it looks really weird on. So I'm definitely retuning these."
2.0,"Not nearly as wet resistant as I'd expected, and the elastic makes them look like panties. My son does not leave the house in them."
2.0,it took forever to get here and it was broken
2.0,"The fit was absolutely ridiculous. There needs to be an accurate description for the size chart. I''<br />6'4 170, and got a XL because I always wear XL for clothes. What Irecommend to anyone ordering this is to order by ur waist size not height."
2.0,"Daughter likes it, but the quality is poor."
2.0,Waist band offers too much compression. I even sized up. But the biggest issue is the compression is in the wrong places. I have a lower tummy due to losing lots of weight and all these did was highlight that due to the waistband having too much compression and making everything else below and above bulge out. It gave me extreme muffin top and was way worse when I would sit.
2.0,"Very cute hat, but it fits really tall and is very stiff. There is also a big bump where the front center seam meets the brim. It sits right on the top of my forehead and is extremely uncomfortable.  I can only wear this hat for about 20 minutes before it is too painful to continue. I thought it might become more comfortable once broken in, but that is not the case. I have had this hat for quite a while with no improvement. Look elsewhere for a pony hat!"
2.0,I did not realize it was so stretchy. I should have gone down a size. As a decoration to break up a dress it is fine.
2.0,"Wow. i don't know who exactly these are tailored to fit - i am 5'11&#34;, 160lbs and i could fit twice over in the medium. The neck hole is absurdly large.<br />Other than that, they're perfect =oP"
2.0,"The color is way off from the green shown, and the seems did not look good, not at all like the picture.  But the fit was flattering and so comfy that I will wear it inside out so it looks like a regular seem and put up with the not so great green.  I would not recommend this if you want it to look anything like the picture though."
2.0,Don‚Äôt waste your money buying this. The straps broke after my 2nd use.
2.0,After washing it - color faded big time and the fishing line in skirt came out everywhere.
2.0,This dress worn on the correct side looks inside out. The material is thick and that's about it.  I'm not impressed with this purchase
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt fit.. buy a size up
2.0,"I am 5ft 2in and 110lbs. The small fit me perfectly, the material wasn't stretched out over parts of my body and didn't bag anywhere. The material is thick enough so it is not see through, but your bra lines will still show<br /><br />I am returning it because the neckline is awkward. It goes much higher than pictured, and does not look as flattering on me as a lower neckline would."
2.0,"Very poor quality, too small"
2.0,"They are not soo bad but they are not the same as the picture, they look more like papar towel than what is supposed to be kind of disappointed."
2.0,not as discribe had to return it
2.0,"The dress was beautiful except the Jews, stitching, bra cups, threads were loose or coming off. Normally everything I order is great from this company. I think this was just this item."
2.0,"I usually seek out and buy Peppers glasses when I have a choice because I like the look and their warranty.  But this latest set is a huge disappointment.  They started to fall apart after literally, their first use.  After taking them off for the first or second time, I noticed one of the hinge screws popping out and starting to come unscrewed.<br /><br />Upon looking closer, I could see that the threads were barely hanging on and tightening the screw didn't help.  Unfortunately, my trying to solve the issue myself led to an unrepairable situation because the hinge connector requires tension in order to put the screw back in.  So in other words, if you buy the same glasses and for whatever reason the hinge screw comes out, you may as well throw these in the trash."
2.0,"One of 3 pairs works correctly, lenses don't match in clarity"
2.0,"Cool socks, but image is really distorted when worn."
2.0,"I got my finger sized at a jewelry store. I ordered a size 7 and it did not fit. The ring was to small either the sent the wrong size , or you need to order a size up."
2.0,I should have paid attention to previous reviews. This was soooooooo small  and I ordered the largest size. According to the sizing chart it should have fit with no problem..guess again!
2.0,The sunglasses look great and stylish. The polarized lenses aren't great.
2.0,It run so small don't like them
2.0,Really wanted to like these.. but I wash my hands once and one broke. Disappointed
2.0,"Ordered the 9 month and it was huge! Too big for my baby who is at his 90th percentile in weight. I assume there is extra room for fitting over other layers, but even so it has a lot of room. I returned it for the 6 month size, because I do love it. Convenient with its magnetic snaps, makes changing time a breeze. My biggest disappointment is that after the effort of the exchange I see the size I got is now on sale. Both the 6 and 9 month were more expensive and now the 6 decreased to the 3 month's less expensive price. But too late for me to return as I cut the tags off. Almost half the price lost (~$20)!!! It seems expensive for its quality as it is."
2.0,"The first surprise when we received the masks was that they weren't ""tightly knit"" fabric as described--they're woven.  Both my wife and I found them awkward to tie on.  Turning the ties into loops would mean bending one of your ears each time you put the mask on or off.  Woven fabric doesn't have the same give as knit fabrics.<br />Patterned masks may appeal to some folks, but this color scheme doesn't coordinate with much.  I realize the masks are for safety, not style, but I think a more neutral pattern or color would be preferable.<br />At this price, it would have been nice if the manufacturer had included a filter to fit in the pocket--otherwise why have one.  Finding a filter that would fit in easily might well be difficult."
2.0,Cheaply made ..Picture on pendent blurry
2.0,"WAY to small! Wouldn't even go over my shoulders! Cute, but the sizing is horrible"
2.0,I love the idea of this hat but the look when I received it was not flattering.  Had to send it back.
2.0,"Not very long like the picture, I have a average torso and it sits for just above the waist.  The stretch is good, but not a flattering fit ."
2.0,Colors are lovely but not worth the aggravation of trying to put them together. Had these when I was a kid and they popped together seamlessly. These were a horror.
2.0,These should only be 3 dollars. Terrible quality.
2.0,"I purchased this pair because they are purported to be magnifying and blue light blocking.  Unfortunately, they are not blue light blocking at all.  Failed all of the tests that I tried.  While they are fairly inexpensive, I could have gotten two pairs of non-blue light blocking glasses for the price of this one, so-called blue light blocking pair."
2.0,"Accidentally ran through the washer and dryer. The whole thing fell apart as the screws backed out. Overall quality prior left something to be desired, but it was functional. Finishing was subpar. Quite easy to lose."
2.0,"I bought these to replace another pair I had that looked just like the gloves in the photo. When this pair arrived, they were really small and they don't have the elastic band that goes around your middle finger. The quality of the material is also sub-par....they started ripping the first time I put them on."
2.0,"Though it was well made & the color was nice, the downside was that the straps were not adjustable. It was just too long for my 5‚Äô3 frame. Therefore had to return."
2.0,I was very disappointed. The robe was not a true large.<br />It is very lightweight. The fit  was poor. I would not recommend it.
2.0,"... the metal is very brittle.  About 15 minutes after I put it on, the belt popped off unexpectedly and one of the metal loops snapped off.  A shame, I really liked it otherwise."
2.0,You get what you pay for.  The mat stretches the elastic and looks like it will eventually fall out and be useless then the elastic stretches.  Works for now and got me to the free shipping level on my order but would not buy again.
2.0,"The wheels do not have a good range at all. If you try to pull it behind you, it feels like you are dragging a bag of rocks. Also, I thought I would prefer the hard structure but it turns out it is very difficult to get things out of the bag without actually laying it on the ground and opening it up like a regular suitcase. This is not what I had in mind as an underseat carry-on. I would have returned it but my husband had already used it for several trips and didn't want to hurt my feelings. I borrowed it and realized how bad it was."
2.0,"This hat looks like an amateur seamstress took a chance making a hat.  The stitching is cheap looking and it doesn‚Äôt have the authentic professional look. If you want a hat and don‚Äôt really care about the way it looks, this may for you.  Sorry, I have to return."
2.0,my hat was smashed and out of shape.
2.0,Arrived much later than promised. Got one delay notice but then came even later than that noticed said it would. Missed out on giving it as a gift. Guess I should have ordered it sooner in case of delays like this. Made a bit cheaper looking than the picture and chain is definitely lower quality than expected.
2.0,Already had leaks needed them for a weekend trip first day out I had water leak in
2.0,This looked dowdy on me. Very loose and unflattering.
2.0,"Earring itself is pretty. It won't stay on my ear as a crawler, falls downward. The wire is squared at the top, I feel like it shouldn't be so wide."
2.0,First retention strap closest to the buckle has broken in less than 9 months. Don't recommend this product but it fits and has weathered OK
2.0,These didn't last on day on the slopes....strap broke on my kids first fall.Very poor stitching on the strap.
2.0,The clarity is great but after a couple days of wearing them the rubber on the earpiece tore.
2.0,"I guess I didn't realize the reading part of the glasses is so small.  Thought it would be the entire bottom half, but I used them following cataract surgery while eyes were healing.  Will get better glasses once eyes have healed.  Frame very thin plastic but the price is right for temporary glasses."
2.0,"The back cuts into my ears, very sharp not smooth."
2.0,They are huge!
2.0,"The pig and dolphin are cute. The others have scary lights and the noises are scary too. I bought to use to distract my pediatric patients, not scare them."
2.0,"This wallet is cute, but it wasn't functional. The card slots aren't sewed or glued. So when you put a card in, good luck getting it out.  Especially, when you use the top slot."
2.0,"this dress was my friendly reminder than just because you can get it on, and zip it and it 'fits' doesnt mean it really fits.  i really wanted this dress to work - i had vision of dressing it up and actually wearing it a show i am going to this weekend but i'll have to keep digging in the closet for another option as it won't be this one. the concept is super cute, but it's just doesn't fit well, hugs in all the wrong spots, and is extremely short; in addition to the short the front of it cuts up so it's even shorter right towards the crotch area - definite opportunities for showing off my some probably want to see when getting out of a car or in and out of a table ... for these reasons this one is a no for me.  if i were shorter (i'm 5'7-5'8ish) with a flat tummy and maybe 30 pounds less, maybe - but probably still no.  not to be a total drag, but the fabric is pretty cheap - it feels thin and low quality.  overall the dress seeems like it could be great and totally cute - unfortunately once received it just didn't live up to the expectations i created for it."
2.0,These shorts took well over two months to arrive and as soon as I got them and tried them on the button to snap ( it is a snap closure) tore right off. These shorts were also much smaller than the size guide said. I wanted to love them but the quality and the fact that it took so long to get here were a loss for me. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not worth the time and money to send it back. Do yourself a favor and pass.
2.0,The glove is very difficult to move. Definitely not functional for a child. My item also didn't light as advertised.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
2.0,SUPER SOFT BUT...<br /><br />This jacket was super soft but it was soooo huge. The pockets also fit really weird but it has a nice color and it is comfy.
2.0,an uncomfortable fit. does not look as good in person as on the site. fabric is too heavy.
2.0,"It's made weird. I don't know if it's just too big or what, but it's really droopy under the armpits, the pockets don't lay flat, and the skirts material is rough."
2.0,"Placed order 10/18, received items 10/21. Tongue rings were really cute. I put them in a small cup to clean them with alcohol before putting them back in the felt bag that was provided. After I was done cleaning them I saw three of the jewels at the bottom of the cup that had fallen out. I didn‚Äôt even have the items for an hour. Will be sending back for a refund."
2.0,"I purchased the &#34;blurple&#34; leggings because in the photo, they look iridescent, like a combination of blue/purple/black, depending on the lighting. Nope, they are just plain blue.<br /><br />I'm tall (5'8&#34;) but thin (120lbs) and I usually wear a size S, so that is what I purchased... Nope, way too short. These leggings only go halfway down my calves.<br /><br />The description also fails to mention that the leggings are very see-through."
2.0,its almost fine... got black inmediately..
2.0,They feel cheep and does not fit well. Also too funky of a stile for me.
2.0,Cute but too big & easy to break.
2.0,"I was pretty disappointed in this. The joints are pretty stiff and don't bend well and the rubber looks very cheap in person. The metal looks dull and overall the bracelet looks cheap. I'm not returning it because my brother expressed interest in it, but I was not satisfied with the quality of this bracelet. It is also HUGE, though our local jeweler was able to take out a link for us."
2.0,This mask would fit a giant! It is so big that the entire picture is under your chin.
2.0,Yes I was very psyched to get this and once I tried it on and it has your brush breasts going towards middle and then you're sticking out of the sides in the top very peculiar fit beautiful looking bra nicely made but it didn't fit.
2.0,"I didn't realize that it had loose padding that would need to be rearranged every time it was washed, similar to a bathing suit top.  Just not convenient for me so I had to return them."
2.0,It has sharp edges
2.0,"I've enjoyed wearing SmartWool products for years, but couldn't find any to buy and settled on these instead. These make my feet sweat, which means they are not merino wool. I would not buy these again and I would not recommend them. Frankly, I'm fed up with false advertising on Amazon and I'm thinking about letting my Prime membership lapse bc quality control is so lacking"
2.0,I‚Äôm a small and this was way to big and too long
2.0,"Used it for what I needed (a halloween costume).  It was VERY see through, so it was an undergarment."
2.0,Super disappointed that this didn‚Äôt work out. I am large chested and the words are at the neck. Way to high.  Completely black across the boo*s. I really wanted this to work! üôÅ
2.0,"this dress is very pretty, however the dress i received had a ton of loose threads.  if it were only a few, i would have kept it, however it was very noticeable, so i had to return it.  i ordered a replacement and it had the same issue."
2.0,"This is a good product, it fits well, it‚Äôs comfortable. The reason I gave it so few stars is that I have ordered it twice now in camouflage, both times has come in as this guitar strap color. You may not get the color you want. I‚Äôm afraid to order it again, I don‚Äôt wanna get stuck with three of the exact same band."
2.0,They are amazing! Unfortunately thwyre too small. And they dont fit true to size cause i got 2 sizes up just in case they were like that but still didnt fitüò¢
2.0,Fits small and not comfortable.
2.0,Nice but runs small. Had to return it.
2.0,"Looked beautiful, but at the end of the day, after 1 day of wearing, bunch of crystals fell out. I can't wear them anymore."
2.0,"They fit very small. The ‚Äúback‚Äù piece barely came above my butt crack. And the ‚Äúfront‚Äù piece was below my belly button. Not at all high waisted. The ‚Äúfront‚Äù part was oddly saggy. I turned them around and they fit like a bikini bottom. The fabric looks like the picture. They didn‚Äôt come laced up, and the strings were cut very roughly with no seams on the ends."
2.0,This shirt has long slits in the sides that are up to high to come down to the top of my jeans or whatever pants i am wearing. It's not made of comfortable material either.
2.0,The seam in the crotch area tore on the second wear. They‚Äôre really cute but just made cheap.
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 38DD, broad shoulders, defined waist, slim hips and legs, big belly. I normally wear a 12 and ordered the large. This dress has a lot of room in it. I have average muscular arms and my arms were drowning in this dress. It hit too low off my shoulders so the sleeves appeared longer and baggier than designed. The ruffle at the bottom is very large and bulky. It‚Äôs light weight but not sheer. Fabric is breathable and not stretchy. You will need patience to iron this dress as it was very wrinkly out of the bag. I didn‚Äôt bother because it was so baggy, I decided to return it. It‚Äôs also a bit youthful. The blue color is very pretty like Cinderella blue."
2.0,Great for a few weeks<br />Then loosens and breaks
2.0,"Although it arrived quickly, this product was waaaay too small."
2.0,"When I first received these slippers and began to wear them, I thought they were the most comfortable slippers I had ever owned.  Now, just after less than three months of normal wear around the house, the stitching on both slippers has very noticeably begun to unravel.  Great comfort...terrible craftsmanship."
2.0,If you want your hands to look like Micky Mouse hands...then you'll love these.
2.0,Most xl fit me but this one was tight in the chest. 38DD
2.0,Just another cheap inflatable
2.0,ordered a large because they said that was my size...well they werent.  go a size or two bigger.  at least my bf can wear them.
2.0,Love a good wrap dress but this one was a let down. It was super see through and fit very small.
2.0,Cute dress but the material is too thin for the style of the dress.
2.0,"The earrings are very cute and I've gotten many compliments, but the top spike was already loose by the time I got around to open the package and it fell off only a day later. Not what I was hoping for."
2.0,"The servers were really weird, not belle shaped at all. I have wide shoulders but even I couldn‚Äôt fit in these properly, they looked like there should live been shoulder pads but there weren‚Äôt. The back was beautiful though."
2.0,Had to return it because the dress didn't come with an inner lining. Felt too light
2.0,"So I got this, had one like it on my bike tour, and this is made really small.  I thought maybe I just ordered the small size by accident but I went to re-order it and it is 'one size fits all'.  The material and stitching looks like it will last a long time but be aware that if you have a larger head this won't work."
2.0,Too large all over although I ordered the smallest.
2.0,There were no care instructions included.
2.0,The waist seems a touch big. They're baggy around the knees and bunch weirdly at my ankles. Maybe going down a size would fix the problem? Who knows.
2.0,"This dress fits really weird.  It bunches up at the butt, collar doesn't lay flat at the back/zipper.  Tried several sizes didn't like any of them :("
2.0,Nice set but pants are way too big üòï
2.0,Way smaller than size chart
2.0,"The pendant was quite small. Also, when I received it - the packaging was very bad. The chain was in a knot and it was very hard to take out. Therefore, I threw the chain away and ordered a separate chain for the pendant."
2.0,"I did not find this dress flattering at all. I have a flat stomach and still managed to look pregnant in it due to where the belt tied. Otherwise, it fit everywhere else."
2.0,The chunky ‚Äú 3D‚ÄùStar and heart are low quality. Those were the ones I got this set for. Half the rings are not quality circle marks on playing in from . The signet has a low quality looking CZ the plating is okay. The other half are pretty the swirl and band were nice.
2.0,It was wider than I expected it to be and the chain broke after only 2 or 3 uses. I would not buy it again.
2.0,"One sandal fits perfect; however the other one, left foot, one strap is too long so my foot is not centered on the sandal."
2.0,Very cheap material almost see through looked more like a t shirt then a sweater
2.0,Product description should say burnt orange not orange. Horrible color!
2.0,Broke within 2 days.
2.0,There were two sets of duplicates. Not that pleased it stated no duplicates
2.0,The velcro on the straps did not last very long to wear they would hold on anymore. i had to cut them off...not impressed
2.0,"Seemed like a great idea, but doesn't really work to organze anything. Not useful, now just sitting on my desk being clutter."
2.0,"I knew the minute I opened the package that this was not solid sterling silver--the dark color of it and high shine...it has the color of stainless steel, like silverware. And it's a shame because it's an adorable, petite little bracelet and I love the design, however it is not sterling silver. The joining pieces near the clasp are turning gold, and I've worn it maybe 5-7 days straight now. The pictures show a nice strong-looking lobster clasp, and it's just a little flimsy, very thin circular clasp that is hard as the devil to fasten, and is so thin it's only a matter of time til it pops and falls to the ground, and the person who finds it and picks it up will say, &#34;Oh, it's just a fake cheap little bracelet.&#34; and will throw it back down. Can't be that upset b/c of the price, only 5.00, but I would have paid more if it were solid sterling silver, as advertised...which is most definitely false. Design is adorable! Quality is a joke."
2.0,Much bigger than normal sunglasses that style and VERY cheap feeling.
2.0,"These aren't awful? They smelt super chemically (if thats a word) and its super bulky in the crotch. I ordered a medium and a large. Both just fit awkward and the chest piece of fabric is to small it that makes sense, like it cuts in to much. They seemed durable tho. Their not made of jean fabric, more of that stretchy jegging fabric."
2.0,"Started ripping inside after one month and I don‚Äôt carry much in my purse except keys, wallet and phone."
2.0,The photo is so deceiving. The material is horrible and it is so much shorter than the photo. I should have read the reviews before hand.
2.0,Used a total of 9 shows only 4 to 5 hours each.. And now its blown. I have other lamps in other scanners that are well over 600 hours of useage and there still good.  Perhaps I got a lemon. Who knows
2.0,"The service was very good, delivery was as advertised.  However, the shirt was not.  The fabric is a rough weave that is very cheap.  It did not wash up well and, although it did not seem to shrink, it did not hold it's shape.  Basically it's not a $49.99 shirt, so I paid for the placard.  [[ASIN:B01LVUOP5Q U.S. Army Logo Embroidered Polo Shirt (X-Large, Black)]]  The body of the shirt and shoulders are sized ok, but the arms are very large.  If you're buying this to attend an event and want to look good, I would look elsewhere."
2.0,There is no difference in fitting between the L size and the XL size!!!
2.0,Is to big
2.0,Not my taste now that I have it.
2.0,"This is the second time I‚Äôve ordered these shorts. The first time I LOVED them but these newer ones are of a different material, more like leggings or yoga pants. The first ones were thinner, softer and more like spandex. And I just hit reorder, the description was exactly the same! Kind of disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,This classes were too large for my face
2.0,"Overall pretty happy with the quality of these goggles, but very disappointed that the goggles do not have lenses like the photo. The lens is very pink, but transparent. The picture makes it look like they are metallic, but they are not."
2.0,Its extremely small and not adjustable...
2.0,"too small. I bought another one of the same brand together and the measure was right, but that was 1 inch tighter at the waist! I've never seen it"
2.0,"The product was a beautiful band that I looked forward to wearing, but it was a nightmare to attach to my Fitbit Versa.  After multiple attempts, and finally a sprung pin in the band, I gave up.  It was as if the top of the pins where the adjustment lever is didn't fit the hole in the Versa band fittings.  Sadly I am returning it for a refund."
2.0,Broke my arm out. Not really sure if sterling silver.
2.0,stretched a lot over a short period of time.
2.0,"Color is not as expected. The sz Large on the left is a dark navy bottom with black top, gray scroll design. The sz XL on the right is black top, black bottom, blue scroll work design. So the product description of Black and White is completely inaccurate. And I guess it depends on size what color you get. Other than that it fits nice."
2.0,After I wore it for the second time it turned a rusty color and left stains on my skin. Very bad product.
2.0,One international trip and it is already fraying.  I can't get it tight enough to stay in place & and if I did there's nothing to stop someone loosening the strap and getting into my suitcase anyway.
2.0,"Arch is not right located, heel support bad"
2.0,I will give the quality of the bag a thumbs up.  I did end up sending it back. It was way too big! I thought it would be a nice size for me. I'm 5'2 and it was huge. I could be my 20lb dog in it and he would be fine. Just too big for me.
2.0,"This is a poor quality key chain. After only having it for 3 weeks, it is starting to tarnish. Also, the crystals are starting to fall off. I paid about $20 after shipping for this key chain, thinking it was a better chain. I was wrong. Its also bulky and heavy. If i could return it I would!"
2.0,"They're cute and I'm happy with the quality for the price, fit as expected Size 7 with enough room for warm socks. However the top ridges are hard and stiff and they really dig into your shin. Quite painful. On the fence if I'll return or try to glue in some foam like another review suggested. Maybe they'll break in? Cuz I do love the size of the heel..."
2.0,Poorly put together and cheaply made.
2.0,I went according to size chart and for normal tank tops yes - accurate - but NOT for compression - These are loose fitting (and I'm a BIG GAL) - Do not order if you want compression - returning mine
2.0,"Not the same quality of other places.  Feels like some knock off.  It was a little longer, too, than the size I ordered"
2.0,"Item runs small, arm color to shirt is disproportionate to the image shown, and the band does not get paid as this is not band authorized merchandise. The seller receipt is quite lovely and the quality of being made in Thailand is very nice but I didn't realized this wasn't authorized mech. I purchased an XL and running small means I probably needed a mens 2XL (I'm 5'6&#34; and 165 40&#34; chest) XL is too small to be a nice and roomy as the image shown."
2.0,"Material is too thin, it does not fit properly, too loose at the chest , fits ok in the hips, the length was ok"
2.0,Cheaply made. Falls apart easy.
2.0,Nice fabric for the jacket but the zipper absolutely sucks! It was hard to zipper from day one but it kept me nice and warm. Sad thing is it didn't even make it a full year as a zipper is no longer working will not be buying this product again.
2.0,I ordered  3xl and it looks like a large
2.0,"I think that would be about right - at a dollar store.<br />It's the worst conceivable quality material. Half the weight per area as a good quality - sparce and coarse and not absorbent.  More like a gym towel than a bath towel - right?<br />The color I got does not 'pop' - it's not a bad turquoise blue - same hue, but 1/4 as bright as the 'flying arm.'<br />I'm disappointed, but I only really bought it for a sample - would see no point at all to wearing one of these."
2.0,"Does not fall in the same place as it looks on the model in the picture even tightened as much as I could. I ended up getting out my jewelry pliers and altering it so it looked better. The material is not really good quality and smells very strong of metal, so strong that once I wore it for a day at school and I could smell it throughout the day by just wearing it. some of the stars on the small necklace were on the chain backwards, so I would have one facing forwards and to backwards, etc. which I also fixed. It was a cute necklace once I finished it. But because of the poor material I didn‚Äôt like wearing it a lot."
2.0,Looks great but no way did we get the right Shirt.<br />I had to give it away to a 15 year old kid.<br />Not what ordered<br />Would love something that actually says the right size
2.0,"Not an over sized shirt. It‚Äôs stretchy so it clings. It is very soft, just not flowing"
2.0,Can't say how this works as I couldn't get it to close. Ordered the correct size.
2.0,"I ordered a large even though I wear a medium. The jacket fit like a small. Very disappointed. However, it did fit my wife."
2.0,"my review is related directly to the lack of quality control, the tag as a whole is solid however no one looked to see if the inscription was correct. it was missing letters. Simple issue things happen but 5 seconds of inspection could have prevented a return and allowed a small gift to be given on Christmas."
2.0,More see-through than I expected
2.0,It was way to big. I ordered a 8 basically in kids and it was like a 12 in kids .
2.0,Back pockets are sewn shut. Meaning the pockets are there and there is an opening but if you try to stick your hand in the pocket it is sewn shut. I tried to cut it open with scissors but it‚Äôs very difficult and tedious to do. This seems like a mistake in manufacturing and not by design. I probably will not order another pair because of this. Although the pants are comfortable yet you need to order a size larger than usual. I wear a size 34 waist but ordered a 38 and they fit well.
2.0,"Pretty, but this bracelet is not for slim wrists. It cannot be pressed to make it smaller, so the weight of the pearls constantly pulls the pearls under my wrist. The pearls are never seen. This would probably work well on larger wrists. Bracelet is pretty, but I'm disappointed with this purchase."
2.0,The advertise seamless but there is a seam on the inside legs!  I was expecting completely seamless!
2.0,"I have purchased several Buffalo Bills flags on amazon, this was my first Sabres flag.  You can see through it.  I knew this flag was going to be one-sided.  I just hadn't expected it to be transparent.  I had planned to hang on my front door, but that won't work because you can see the windows right through it.  I like the design so I'll likely just sew some fabric on the back - but if you aren't willing to do that, this is probably not the right flag for you. If you hang on a plain white wall, you might be ok.  If your bar or sports-cave has wood paneled walls - you are going to see the knots through this flag."
2.0,Buckle does not work very well. Hard to tighten.
2.0,I honestly thought this puffer would be way better quality for $50. It came vacuum sealed and once I let it sit out for a full day it was still sad and not puffy. There is obviously a lack of stuffing and some places that are definitely missing stuffing (like in the collar so it is lopsided). The zip tie at the bottom completely broke before I even got to use it. Seems very fragile for $50.
2.0,It was very cheaply made and not at all as it appeared online.
2.0,"The bow is poorly made. I tried to pin in on the dress and it immediately broke. The dress is cute but will now have to buy a new now or try and see it on. For all that I would have purchased another dress. Very disappointed, would not recommend this purchase"
2.0,"Cute/comfy dress but zipper stopped working after only a few wears. Only one side would zip, it was stuck on the other side although there was no fabric in or any bent teeth. Then the pull part completely popped off, so the dress in now unwearable."
2.0,Looks and described as silk midi flower pattern dress. I got a short stripe cotton mini dress. I had to return.
2.0,I returned this item. It was made of very cheap material and the stripes were printed on. It looked something like a prisoner costume from Halloween. At least it offers Free Returns.
2.0,Much too large for my XL body. Sleeves too long. Collar too high.<br />Dp not recommend.
2.0,"I love the fit of the dress and the pattern is super cute, but the material is lacking. For the price, it should be much better quality. One time of wearing and the material is fraying as you can see in the pictures."
2.0,"poor quality fabric, made for someone with no boobs and a mile long torso."
2.0,I wanted badly to love this. I have horrible self confidence right now. Ive had 3 kids and obviously my tummy needs some work. This was NOT the answer. It fit fine. It was easy enough to get on. It does smooth you a bit. The problem comes with the fact that it didnt get that curved waist you expect and worst of all.. BOTH the side metal bones ripped out. They kept stabbing me and finally fell all the way out. The simply ripped through the bottom and out they came
2.0,Too short.  Not functional for me.  Customer service is excellent.
2.0,Cute but not kids size
2.0,"I threw them away. They were way to tight, couldn‚Äôt even get them all the way up and the material wasn‚Äôt great."
2.0,This is way to big
2.0,"Necklace was for my daughter's birthday.  Chain was broken in the package but that's ok- I put the charm on a much better , higher quality chain anyway.<br /><br />Daughter loves it ! BTS is her favorite KPOP band."
2.0,"I wish I had returned this, but I wore it."
2.0,This fit the new Fitbit Sense perfectly. Good solid closure and comfortable to wear. Problem- not well made. The piece that connects to the Fitbit is a thin piece of plastic. It broke in 60 days. And I didn't even wear it daily because I have several other bands.
2.0,"Really thin material, runs small."
2.0,"I have been looking for comfortable sandals that are good for hiking. These sandals are the most comfortable I've worn, but they will fall apart like hot butter as soon as they get wet for a day (see picture). For the price, I was expecting something more durable. I'll have to keep looking."
2.0,This cleaning gloves easy to use.. also easy to get dryrop.. could also be a bit longer.. didn‚Äôt worth the price
2.0,Size was too small for my 12 year old daughter. Used the size chart provided. Price was cheap so its not even worth the trip to return it. Will wait for my middle daughter to grow into it.
2.0,At least 2 sizes smaller. XXL does not fit normal medium
2.0,"I am 5 feet tall and average weight.  They constricted my ankles.  I wear a size 6.5 shoe.  I gave them to my daughter who is an adult, but wears a size 5 shoe.  She found them comfortable."
2.0,"It's cheap. But so is the price. The top is cute, but the cross string in the front broke the first day of wearing it. I'm an athletic 5'7'' 150lbs and the bottoms did not fit me. It's almost like the front and back part of the bottoms are identically cut.. making it impossible to distinguish which way to wear them. It feels uncomfortable, but you can't really notice it visually. If this were made better it would be my favorite bikini. I should have returned it."
2.0,Very cheaply made product. The pants had a ridiculously tiny waist that would not fit any 14 year old. My son is a slim tall 11 year old and I got 14 for length and the waist would not come close to buttoning. We ended up using the shirt and vest. The vest would not stay closed in the back and the shirts material was very very stiff and rough.  Not worth even 29.99.  More like costume quality.
2.0,"Great if you B cup or smaller, but I have Fs and a large should accommodate a larger chest."
2.0,"jacket was very nice but extremely small and something came damaged. customer service with The Mogan was terrible at giving me a prepaid label, i had to email so many times and file a complaint with amazon until they finally relented so i could return this jacket."
2.0,its was okay
2.0,Was expecting an xl received a l.
2.0,"It was so beautiful, but after using it once, 3 charms fell off. Sooo, yeah. What can you do??"
2.0,"Beautiful ring at first. However once I put it on the ""opal"" fell off. Turned out to be just painted plastic. But a little super glue and clean up, couldn't really tell."
2.0,Not high enough. Doesn't reach the calf area
2.0,"I ordered a large, and got an XL.  The printed tag says Large, but the actual shirt tag says XL, so I can see how the error was made, but it's still frustrating.  It's a gift, and I don't have time to return it, so I guess I'll just go with it."
2.0,there not that comfy
2.0,"It's great if you never want to use anything in the wallet. Whether it is cards or cash, is always a fight.  Also, sliding cash under the elastic... folding bills one extra fold... to much time.  I end up with loose bills in my pocket, because I don't want to spend extra time folding up and stuffing under the strap.  Going back to my simple leather wallet with magnetic money clip."
2.0,"Beautiful dress but it was so incredibly long I had to pay $100 just to takeoff all of the extra material. I needed 7 inches off and then realized I need even more because I wanted it to lay directly across my toes I am 5‚Äô7 and had 3 inch heels on and still couldn‚Äôt take it up off the floor. The waist was huge, the chest was very tight and so is the waist it doesn‚Äôt blend together well."
2.0,"It‚Äôs super cute, unfortunately when you place the credit cards in the slots they slide all the way to the bottom of the wallet. The pockets they have  for credit cards, your license and that sort of thing  aren‚Äôt staggered so they‚Äôre useless."
2.0,"The photos did not clearly show that the back was cut out, a style clearly too young for a slender yet 62 year old."
2.0,"The stone turned out to be translucent nothing like the picture. I was planing to add it to a gift bag for a friends birthday, I decided against it when I saw the stone."
2.0,My jacket has a rip in the collar and doesn‚Äôt fit right. Not happy with the quality at all. Would like my money back.
2.0,Just small.  Pulling Vail over face was like a mask.  Keeping for Halloween just in case I find use for it.
2.0,I ordered the teal with brown straps and received an all demon blue bag. Bag is a lot smaller than expected. Very little fits into it. I would not buy again.
2.0,"The bracelet read ""straighten your crow."" Really? I'm extremely disappointed that this was sent to my friend after the loss of her father AND it was shipped/arrived late to boot."
2.0,"This is a really cute top, love the pattern, but a few problems.  It is very tiny in the bust area.  Not good at all for big chested women.  Also, very short in length, would have to be worn win leggings or something, way too short for a dress.  Ended up giving this one to my teenage daughter.  Way too tiny for me.  I am usually an adult medium and I ordered an XL and it was still too tiny.  Also, the little decorative balls around the neckline only go half way around, so looks kind of funny that it's not completed."
2.0,I love the shoe however the fur has rolled up and become matted where the bottom of your feet is. You can feel it as you walk in them and put the on. I‚Äôve tried cutting it out but it hard to see in the inside of the slippers. They are very soft and fluffy otherwise
2.0,Runs a little small and the fabric is very stiff.
2.0,It's my fault I did not return it but it broke the first time I tried to use it
2.0,wanted to love it but the bow didn't work. it's made of same material as dress so too think to make proper bow.
2.0,"The idea of having reading glasses integrated to otherwise normal sunglasses seemed a good one.<br /><br />The glasses arrived in a padded envelope and the included case is not rigid either. As a result, the nose bridge separated from one side (see picture). It turned out repairable but it‚Äôs hard to say if the subsequent fragility is a result of that or inherent to the design. (Judging by the looks, I‚Äôd tend to think the latter.)<br /><br />Once ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù, the glasses turned out to be a bit tight for my admittedly large head. The lenses have reading insets (2.5+) and that is a good idea. I‚Äôm not used to that and at least initially it feels like the reading portion is a bit too high, or at least a bit close to normal vision (without a prescription). The lenses have a bit of a graduated tint and do not appear to have polarization or coatings (scratch or fog resistance).<br /><br />The frame does not ooze strength and although I don‚Äôt have extensive experience with it, I‚Äôm not sure it would endure much more than careful treatment. The soft case is actually fairly stylish but also doesn‚Äôt keep the glasses from adverse forces under rough treatment."
2.0,Pulled up right away
2.0,product not up to par<br />no fefund received
2.0,Too tight across the top. Had to give to someone with smaller breast. Order size larger if you order.
2.0,Bought it for my cousins birthday honestly I thought it would fit more and was a little bigger based on whats shown in the pictures but it came and it barely fits anything it‚Äôs superrrrr small for $20 it should be 10üôÑnot worth the price.
2.0,"This charm, which is really two charms is pretty as awhole.  But when I ordered it I didn't realize it separated.  Not real crazy about that.  I realize it's meant to be separated and given to a daughter.  But half a butterfly is not pretty. Also it is a large charm and heavy. Not sure I will even wear it. If I hadn't thrown shipping things away I might return it."
2.0,Bought these mainly due to reviews... am so dissatisfied with this product.  I AM A NARROW SIZE 7 obviously my toes are normal even skinny COULD NOT get them on my toes !! Very uncomfortable had to use scissors to properly place them.  Totally disappointed with them my fault for relying on the reviews  buyer beware.
2.0,"Received this necklace and pendant and wasn't impressed how it looked. To me it looked cheap. The gold plating made it seem very fake, like something you would get in those old quarter machines with the little plastic balls with the prize inside. Not impressed at all."
2.0,it has two giant pockets that look like they belong in the back because when u tuck the pocket in the front ( the right way) it makes two big bulges
2.0,"A very handsome checkbook cover, but badly designed for practical usage. The leather is nice, the dye consistent and rich looking, sewing is good, but the pen loop is placed on the flap inside, rather than on an outer edge. The center separating the flaps is rather skimpy, leaving very little space for the thickness of the contents. It's impossible to close with anything other than blank checks in it. The pen loop even prevents proper closure if the check register is inserted. This makes it almost useless. Too bad, because the price is certainly a bargain. I've returned this item and paid quite a bit more for one that's functional.<br />I don't quite understand why this is listed as a &#34;Men's Leather Checkbook Cover&#34;; could be used by anyone."
2.0,"I love the look of the sweater, but it did not fit to size or come to the front the way they normally do!"
2.0,This shirt is bright red not a soft red like the picture and the logo was crooked.
2.0,Not for metal sensitivity.  The pretty decorative part is not surgical steel.
2.0,"This product does NOT match the picture provided.  The lace is see through and the picture makes you believe that it is solid.  Also, the lace is wider in the front than it is in the back.  I bought this slip specifically for the solid lace to be used as a skirt extender for my daughters choir dress.  This slip isn't going to work for that purpose.  Very misleading."
2.0,"Kind of cheap...which for the price, was to be expected."
2.0,So bad for swimming because always waters come inside the goggles and hard to see everywhere.
2.0,Material was ok. But way too small for a 5 year old child and i purchased 6 to 7 years... wayyyyy too small
2.0,CHEAPLY MADE AND ILL FITTING
2.0,Uncomfortable - sizing inaccurate
2.0,Not practical
2.0,Very cute but won‚Äôt stay attached to the watch. Worn about a week and have almost lost my watch about a half dozen times. Not worth losing my expensive watch face by looking cute.
2.0,"Very thin and small, not my favorite."
2.0,Poor quality.  Logo not made well
2.0,"It's practically a door knocker it's so big! Not really a realistic necklace, unless you're a priest."
2.0,Grande y huele horrible
2.0,Pretty narrow shoes and the shoe laces didn't want to stay tied no matter who tied them
2.0,The shirts are totally out of proportion. It's short in the waist and huge in the neck. They<br />do not fit well
2.0,"Poor quality fabric, I returned"
2.0,"I really looked forward to having these leggings for our cold Pennsylvania winter.  Unfortunately the waist panel does not provide enough compression, so the waist seam stitching split my lower abdomen right in half.  I'm 5'3, 135lbs, typically a size small and sadly they left me with a very unflattering midsection.  had to return."
2.0,"Fits well, but silvery ring has already rubbed off in many areas after wearing for 3 days. Wish he had worn that ring first, as that is the only reason I bought this product. He wore the black one without any issues, but the metallic looking ring is ruined and it's too late to exchange or get a refund. :-(  At least he has the other 2, but I'm deeply disappointed"
2.0,"It's pretty, but doesn't fit nicely around my 7&#34; wrist."
2.0,a large is usually too big for me me. i decided to get the xlarge in this and it's so small.<br />beware it runs small.
2.0,Not as durable as expected.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:e4acddcc1870c99c13a6f36df00f49c2]] The clasp does not open.
2.0,Very see through :(
2.0,"They look good.  No problem there, and I expected these to be light (cheap) due to the price, but I found the openings too small for my nipples.  Oh well."
2.0,This worked for a couple weeks and it still works however it is so cheap that it falls apart and we have to continuously put it back together each time to use it.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this rash guard.  Very cute print.  But like other reviewers stated, the sizing is way off.  I usually wear a small or medium and I ordered an XL based on other reviews.  It probably would have been alright if it was only a 1/4 zip...but with a full zipper it just didn't work for me.  I think it would be good for someone that doesn't need to wear a bra.  The pockets with the foam inserts don't offer any support."
2.0,I am only 5'4&#34; 165 and i ordered a large. The shirt sleeves are to short and the bottoms are tight. If you are tall do not order this set. The material is very comfortable and it does keep you warm
2.0,"Well, the earrings are absolutely adorable...unfortunately they arrived in awful condition. The stand was broken completely in half. One pair of earrings was missing and one earring was broken."
2.0,"cheap plastic construction, lens distortion.  But it is a cheap pair of sunglasses afterall"
2.0,"This felt so awkward. Without a bottom strap across the back, I didn't feel like there was really much holding it in place."
2.0,"This is a very decent helmet and I would have given it five stars, but upon receiving it, I noticed two very large paint blotches on it. Clearly someone did not take pride in their quality of how it was painted. This is unfortunate, as it would have been excellent without the poor paint job. There is also no way to refund or exchange the item, even though it is on prime?"
2.0,Without major airflow these fog up pretty bad render them useless. Summertime glasses
2.0,I didn't like the material of this top but fit ok.
2.0,"The legs may be very baggy but the waist runs small even though the description says ""designed for plus size"". The fabric is very thin, mostly cotton, definitely summer wear. I have a few other Buykud pieces and the quality is kind of all over the place. Sometimes the sizing is generous and sometimes it's not, sometimes the fabric is good quality and sometimes it's like paper. They all say cotton/linen but are mostly cotton and one dress I bought that said cotton/linen was actually neoprene but is actually a great dress.<br />It's very hit or miss but worth trying if you don't mind returning. If it works it could definitely be a go to piece."
2.0,"T-shirt material, cheap and wrinkled beyond wrinkle."
2.0,Does not fit true to size and very thin material
2.0,One stone is not glued on the right place
2.0,"The fabric was not quite what I expected for this item - it kind of felt like a windbreaker. Also, the cut in the hip area is a little strange. Maybe it's because I have relatively narrow hips, but it felt very baggy in that area. From the waist up it was very cute, but I am returning it due to the fit issue."
2.0,I like the style but it's super thin material
2.0,It was too small even after ordering an xlarge. The colors of the Christmas trees are faded. Not nearly as vivid as the picture shows. I wish I would have read more reviews as others have said the same about size and colors.
2.0,Love the color good material but shrinks when you wash it
2.0,"I am not very happy with the quality of this item, the bottom of the dress was all super messy and kinked up, my daughter said it was itchy, and it did not come with the bracelet as advertised, definitely poor quality and not worth the money paid for it."
2.0,A beautiful design and quality below the waist however the lace is very delicate and already tore as I was pulling the zipper down. Tend to fit one to one and a half size smaller then all my other dresses of the same size
2.0,"The earrings are pretty there are a few cons about them, I have very sensitive ears, thought that the titanium would be the way to go cheaper than gold and are supposed to be great for sensitivity issues, it was not the case for me. My ears still hurt and I only wore them for 4 hours and they are way too big."
2.0,"Really pretty bracelet... until it tarnishes. If you purchase this, do so for very occasional wearing. It would be okay if you only wore it for special occasions, but mine is totally tarnished (especially on the inside)."
2.0,I cannot stand these. I have to literally keep pulling my pants up and my panties now. Not how stretch should be!
2.0,White is see thru. =(
2.0,I ordered a large and it was too small across the busy and across the back. I could just tell it was going to rip if I moved in just the right way. I had to send back.
2.0,"The shirt is ok, fabric will be hot to wear. The bottom is not cut straight."
2.0,This is so short.
2.0,Fabric is thin and cheap
2.0,"I tried to clean these earrings in a silver solution, and they came out yellow!  No longer able to wear them, and they were pretty.  You should send cleaning instructions for your products!"
2.0,"This hat rides weird on your head. Quite a bit of space between top of your ears attachment point and the bottom edge of this hat. Sits too high upon your head, doesn't cover enough of side of your head from the sun. And I don't have an inordinately huge head or anything."
2.0,"I really liked this dress, but unfortunately it was just slightly too small. Wish it was offered in more sizes."
2.0,These are super warm and great if not driving. The thumb area lining on mine seems to have ripped already though. Will be sewing them back.
2.0,"Good price, but the image on the shirt is not detailed as the guy on the picture it‚Äôs a much more generic pizza image, only 2 D. Still cute but not accurate"
2.0,You can see everything : /
2.0,Love the colors and style. The dress does not give in the arms.<br /><br />Returning the dress
2.0,"Looked like it would be cute, but absolutely gigantic. There's no elastic in it, so none around the back of the top to keep it in place. No elastic in the legs. Not sure how they plan to keep that covering the pertinent areas. No way to make it fit better."
2.0,"They're really cute, they don't constantly slip off in my shoe, however they get holes really easily. definitly cheap quality."
2.0,Bought this for my girlfriend and she stated &#34; I usually wear a size 10 for my skirts and pants but the large did not fit once the zipper was going up. To tight.
2.0,"I gave this shirt away to my little sister. The sleeves are tiny, sheer material<br />Sorry, I just didn't like this."
2.0,I got the small size because that is the smallest size and my glasses are actually kid frames so the sun glasses did still fit big on me. The reason I gave only 2 stars because the over the ear piece is on the thicker side and hurts my ears pretty bad.
2.0,"It's a cute necklace, but it the charm quickly broke off the string so I would just recommend getting a higher quality one."
2.0,"This item I ordered a large and I am a small or extra small. I like the fit, but the colors are very muted compared to picture and it was a weird material.  The picture looks like  it was used from another website compared to what I received. It's fine, but don't love it."
2.0,"Meh, nothing beats my Reflex leggings. I figured I'd give these a try because they're a bit cheaper than the Reflex brand and have more color options. I bought the light grey and wine red in size small. I am 130 lbs, 5'2&#34; with muscular build.<br /><br />These do have a nice feeling. They are a bit thinner so they breathe more. The stitching and material seem durable. They remind me a lot of my Under Armour leggings in terms of texture and fit. They are mid rise, but the grey ones are definitely higher than the red (which cuts my mid section in an unflattering way and gives me a muffin top, so they slide a bit). The grey ones stay in place fine. I only have that problem with the red.<br /><br />They are both see through with dark underwear, unfortunately. I don't understand how so many people are calling them squat proof, I guess that's assuming it's nude toned underwear? I feel like squatproof should be in every color of underwear. I could see the tag straight through on both colors *without squatting*, too. You can see it in the pictures. They're fine in nude underwear. I can see the tone of my skin through my knees on the grey ones. These are probably passable, but not as thick as I would like for weightlifting, especially leg day.<br /><br />I like Tesla compression shirts a lot. These are just okay. I'll stick to my trusted Reflex leggings.<br /><br />Update: I ended up returning these after the first wear. They are unflattering on me and accentuate the body fat that I carry in my midsection. If I try to hike then up so they stay above my waist, they give really bad camel toe. I think you're better off spending a couple more dollars on Reflex or Yogalicious."
2.0,"I placed this order and I immediately tried to cancel it when I realized it would take nearly 2 months to get it. The company never responded to my multiple return requests. I did receive it, and it had a strong chemical smell, but after washing it it didn‚Äôt smell so bad ‚Äì it‚Äôs a little bit large for me, but I have a petite frame.  It doesn‚Äôt look as stylish as the photo, but it is OK to wear for work.  I don‚Äôt like being forced to purchase something ‚Äì I literally tried to cancel the order within minutes."
2.0,It looks pretty in the picture and the interior is exactly what I was looking for but the material it is made out of looks and feels cheap. It is too stiff.
2.0,"I bought this product thinking I was getting a size 10.  I pants came in a size 10-14, big difference in a size 10 and 14.  Pants are to big for a person wearing a size 10.Probably a better fit for a size 14."
2.0,It is different than the displayed pictures above<br />I thought it will be like a jeans or so
2.0,"These are weird.  There is no front or back, so good luck figuring out how to wear them.  The stretchiness is OK, but the waistband doesn't stay snug enough.  One pair started fraying at the waist after the first wash."
2.0,"I was looking for a tunic dress that had a higher neckline for cooler weather and this looked like it.  I am on the border of petite size, so sometimes regular sizes don't fit right, but this had a very deep scoop neckline when I got it in both the front and the back. I usually wear a large, but this one was a bit tight through the chest.  That is usually not a problem I have in regular sizes.  I did like the fabric. I returned it."
2.0,All the tassel are falling off when you try on floor was covered I paid with my card was given a credit not fair
2.0,"The black piece fell out of the ring within days. Love the ring, not the quality."
2.0,Extremely large charm. This looked cheap. Much cuter in picture than in person
2.0,"I ordered my usual size, but these fit oddly on me. It felt tight around my back, and the cups didn't fill out nicely like my other bras. However, even if they did fit, I probably would wear them often as I don't like the style. In the photo, it looks like the cups blended with the lace. In reality, the cups don't. They remind me of Ariel seashell cups with a bit of lace over them. It isn't a nice look."
2.0,"advertised as fitting pandora braclet, dose'nt"
2.0,"The chain is way too small so I wasn‚Äôt even able to wear it, and the diamond eventually fell out. But I love the idea"
2.0,"I‚Äôm<br />About 107 , 5‚Äô4‚Äù  ordered a small<br />It was huge, was very unflattering and material was heavy"
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this purchase. I was sorely disappointed. The sides were shaped differently and made one side look okay but the other side look wonky. These are huge and look visibly fake. The colors are pretty, the magnets are strong, but I feel like I wasted $10 on junk."
2.0,"These socks don't stay up on my heel.  They are not uncomfortable when they slide done,  but they just don't stay on my heel.  I have tried them with several pair of shoes and the same thing, they slide.  I have bought them in the pasy and loved them, guess I just got a bad batch!!!"
2.0,"It's a pretty dress, it's just alot larger then I expected. I ordered a small and it is at least a large."
2.0,"***REVISED***<br />ORDERED 2ND PAIR, ARMY GREEN. NOT CHILD MEDIUM. I CAN WEAR THEM AS AN ADULT. RETURNING 2ND PAIR.<br />(1ST REVIEW) Kahki Good fit. Thin material though. Not for cold weather"
2.0,"Seem to run small, but the bigger issue is that they don‚Äôt feel stable-too easy to slip out of sideways."
2.0,Too many slots and this really weighs down the purse.  Loved the texture.  It could be a lot slimmer if the cards holders were vertical
2.0,Way too tight through the bust line. The pink color is washed out looking. It might look better on a more slender woman.
2.0,"The description said there were 12 rocks; however,  I only received 11 as shown in the picture."
2.0,"Nice price - this is the extra star for ,not more.<br />Baught for my daughter the white dress.<br />The dress is not proportional ,strange fitting.<br />The biggest and major problem with this dress is that it‚Äôs see through.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend purchasing in this item."
2.0,"Wore it for about 5 min until someone pointed out that it had a hole on the bum üôÑ<br />Really disappointed in the quality , can‚Äôt return since I threw out the package"
2.0,"I bought this after purchasing the Stained Glass Disney Beauty and the Beast shirt in the same size.  I loved it, but am disappointed in the quality of the Little Mermaid Ariel Stained Glass shirt.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid shirt looks black, but it is more of a dark gray color.  The stained glass image has dull coloring that is mostly green.  It is not pretty and vibrant the way most Disney shirts are.<br /><br />If I had seen this shirt in a store in person, I would not have purchased it."
2.0,Too loose didn't fit well needs elastic bands to help keep in place my waist is smaller then my butt so I sent back for refund
2.0,These things are huge and the wire is way too long #!!
2.0,"This shirt is not long, at all. It is more boxy than it looks in the photo. Comfy but not the long shirt I'd hoped for."
2.0,Very cheap and unflattering! Returned immediately.
2.0,The smell is really strong that I can‚Äôt even wear it and it gives me a migraine :/ Besides that it‚Äôs cool
2.0,"I was so hoping to like this top. It's super cute, even in person but it's made with a poor quality fabric. The top is literally made out of a lining fabric, and a cheap one at that. It feels papery and thin. Definitely disappointed"
2.0,"I love the way it looks. Fits just like the picture shows. I wore it with navy blue keds, pearl studs, and got so many compliments on my dress. However, my husband told me that he hated it, but loved it at the same time. He compared the fabric to a table cloth... I wish the fabric was better quality, but it looks cute, so I'm still going to wear it. I was going to return it, but I like the way it fits."
2.0,Very apealing to the eye but not very good quality.
2.0,"I bought a medium and I'm 34C.  This bra is a cute kind of bralette that you would not want to use for any type of sporting activity, even a very light one such as yoga (which is what I bought it for).  The bra does not fit snugly under the bust so that you could easily fall out of the bottom and it is made out of some type of jersey material, not a sport or swim type material.  IT is cute though and the straps across the front are as pictured, just don't buy this thinking it is snug or in anyway appropriate for fitness of any kind."
2.0,"Very thin material throughout.  Does not wick moisture well.  Nonexistent cushioning.  Does not compare to even an average athletic sock.  Go with Injinji or an established brand if you want something in this category that you can use for running, hiking, walking."
2.0,"Overall, it wasn't a good fit for me. I am 5""1 with a small frame and it was huge on me. The material wasn't the best either. Honestly, it looked like a curtain or a bed spread!"
2.0,They are really heavy on the ears.
2.0,I returned these and went with Burton pants.  They fit well and seemed like they would be warm but were a bit bulky for what I like out of snowboarding pants. I like having something more lightweight for better mobility.
2.0,I've bought so many of these dresses and had to return them because they're too big and long. It would be cute on a tall person. I wish they made this in an xsmall for us short girls!
2.0,"These feel like a heavy linen material. The black color was true black, not faded. The smocked waist is very wide/stretchy. I felt that they run big, and I could have gone down a size. The pockets are too low on the thigh, not the hip, and they poof out. They made the pants look odd. I'm 5'4"", and the length was off for me. They didn't go to the floor, but they weren't cropped either. They are very wide legged, so where they hit just at my ankle doesn't look good on me."
2.0,After a few days of wearing them. I noticed a hole in my sock
2.0,"When I first received this I absolutely loved it. I liked how I could keep my car key on a separate end from my other keys. Unfortunately, in the first picture you'll see how once the tiny screw's end fell off it just fell apart. I now have two separate keychains. Not what I was going for."
2.0,"Pro: They are stylish and look like they should cost more than they do.<br />Con: They are cheaply made.  The post bent as I put the earring on and I can tell it will eventually break, probably sooner than later.  The backing is difficult to attach and will make that happen faster so consider using a different backing."
2.0,These sunglasses were super cute but I couldn‚Äôt see anything with them on so unfortunately I had to return them
2.0,The materials  was not what I  expected
2.0,"Very thin material, not quite solid construction. For the price, try Uniqlo or Stock Mfg instead."
2.0,"This pair of sunglasses wins the prize for flimsiest sunglasses ever encountered! The frames and temples must have been constructed out of black-painted twist-ties! I'm not kidding. These are made of wire so thin I was afraid of unfolding them!<br /><br />They sit on the face okay, but the frame that holds the lenses is arrow straight across the face. Since there's no bend conforming to the face, they allow a lot of light from the sides. Really, these are simply not very effective shades. Even for the price these aren't very good!"
2.0,"Do not like this bra, too tight even though I measured and have always won the same size, I think I will stick to buying bras at the store that way I can try and make sure it fits right."
2.0,This arrived with one of the ears only attached on one side. It's cute but will have to be glued back together before it can be worn.
2.0,"I don't care for the provided straws, and it's difficult to get the straws through the little hole. As a nurse, I know that the mask is poorly made. There's no way to mold it around your nose, so germs can just come and go as they please. It also looks a little silly because the straw holder is really large. Lastly, the straw holder isn't secured in the mask. I tucked my mask under my chin for a moment, and it simply fell out."
2.0,"the quality was cheap, the heart rings were way to big, the pink ones buckles were facing the wrong way, and had some lines in the leather or whatever it was."
2.0,"Gifted to my niece, made for the anorexic."
2.0,This shoe runs wayyyyy to big... shoe says size infant 3 this is more like an infant 5... shoe is cute but I‚Äôm very disappointed as my daughter won‚Äôt be able to fit this anytime soon.
2.0,"For the price, the cosmetics of the watch Is very nice, however it don't keep time. In the photo the time was 9pm not 8:55pm. What I expected was new watch to come with a new battery."
2.0,"I thought it would be better as a table cloth, not a scarf. It is way to wide."
2.0,"This Henley shirt was an attractive blue color, lightweight enough for warm weather, but the small size was way too large for me. I have worn small size shirts my entire adult life and of course know how a small shirt should fit. This one badly missed the mark and was returned for refund."
2.0,Ok for Halloween or young girl...
2.0,Didn't look good on me.
2.0,Strap broke after a couple months so I had a friend put it on a better one.  Really poor quality leather.
2.0,I just couldn't justify paying almost $50 for these boots. They looked cheap and I could see the glue on the the sides. They were also too shiny. The style is every cute and the height was perfect. They were comfortable for this type of boot. Really was just a decision that they didn't fit my style.
2.0,"Just looks awkward on, and is not as fine quality as the image."
2.0,Don't waster your money unless buyin it for a child.  Very cheaply made. No tags. Like someone slapped it together in a hurry.
2.0,Way too small and completely see through.
2.0,Gaps at top
2.0,"I do like the skirt, and it fits well. However I received something clearly worn by someone else. It was stuffed in the plastic bag, not folded, and severely reeked of perfume. Another one won't get here by when I need it, so I may just return for a refund, if I can't get the smell out."
2.0,"I love the way these fit, but I didn't realize that they were a mtelic sheen print, my fault I bought in a hurry and didn't read descriptions. Way to glitzy and shiny for my taste. But they fit great and good quality material and stitching. So if you love shiny and glitzy you will love these"
2.0,Cute but not for little girls. My 5yr old has silly sock day at school and she wanted these socks. They are huge and will not work.
2.0,Like the butterfly  but little small
2.0,"Did not like these at all. The drawstrings are flimsy, and the fabric does not feel like denim at all. It is some weird lightweight  rough-feeling fabric.<br />The size was fine."
2.0,Nice color and print but neck looked like it had been stretched out.
2.0,Band and cup are both a little larger than the 36DDD I wear.  I ended up wearing my regular bra under this as a way to lock it down more.<br /><br />Difficult to wrangle into due  to the construction.  You can't really hook in the front and spin it around.
2.0,The torso is short but more importantly - this chafes the chest - maybe because of the way the cups aren't sewn in place?
2.0,don't liked me
2.0,"The needle on the product broke when I tried to add the very first button to a piece of clothing.  I was very excited to try this item, but don't know if I got a defective product."
2.0,Prob. But I didnt like the fit. This is more for a skinny person
2.0,The Shirt Fabric is super thin and feels very cheaply made ------- Not Worth $25 ! Would Not Recommend.
2.0,I just bought this and can't wear it due to the material being way too scratchy. I'd return but washed it and didn't save bag.
2.0,Big cheap bag!
2.0,"I like the liik of the belt, the color is good but doesn't look like the color I ordered. The belt also too wide and does not fit comfortably around my waist."
2.0,Shirt was was not expensive so that's good but I didn't like it overall.  Fit was weird and the collar is disproportionately large.  I am returning.
2.0,The first time i put it on i found the pants seams open and fraying in two spots. Poorly sewn.
2.0,"Nice and sturdy converter - did not work well with my pin. Will try it later with a different pin, plan to keep for future use"
2.0,"I loved how these glasses felt/looked on my face, but they broke literally while I was wearing them. They simply fell apart. Its too bad because they looked good while they lasted."
2.0,Feathers were all over the place!
2.0,"Nothing as pictured.....the chain is not the one in the picture, but very cheap and the color of the charm is not matching the chain but is yellow gold tone.  Good thing it is inexpensive as I was very disappointed."
2.0,The style is cute but the material is very thin and the finishing on the neckline is terrible. I don't expect it to last through more than a couple of washings.
2.0,Like the dress but too small
2.0,"I was so excited, but the balloons were such a disappointment, 2 broke, 2 deflated, it was a complete mess and you can't just replace them last minute."
2.0,"I'm a Large Tall guy, and Joe's USA usually does me right. Unfortunately this shirt is an XL. The chest is definitely not a large, and I wouldn't be surprised if it measured to a XXL. The bottom button on the shirt is well above my belt line so I'm giving a show with a gust of wind. Shirt does hang low like a tall fitting shirt. Sleeves are refreshingly long enough."
2.0,It's cute and comfy if you want to buy a new one every couple of months. It lasted exactly 2 months before one of the string of beads broke while on my arm and beads went flying everywhere.
2.0,The material is far more shiny than pictured...blue is brighter. Not a fan of the material.
2.0,"There is spring that moves when it shroud be hard so you are able to move it as you need , with spring it is hard to adjust to the back of the shoe because it moves."
2.0,This was more like a 2T than 4. Very disappointing
2.0,This is a great saying but the size of it is so small that you can't actually read what it says. I now have to find a plan B for a stocking stuffer.
2.0,"Top looks exactly like the picture... until you put it on. Not flattering AT ALL. Loose in all the wrong places, fabric is super stretchy accentuating and clinging to all the wrong curves and bumps."
2.0,"Fits tighter and small, but it wasn‚Äôt bad. Just a bit shorter in length and tighter in the abdomen. My biggest issue was that I ordered the white, and I could see the sewn-in pads clearly though the top layer. Had it not been for this, I would have probably really liked the top. The fabric is soft and less scratchy cottony and more workout. Sadly will be returning the white one."
2.0,Is engraved but when I bought it it didn‚Äôt say that it was engraved.<br />Had to return it.
2.0,"Makers should consider the inside of dress behind calf that is visible, i am seeing the other side of fabric which is showing white. Its an eye soar to me.  Should have put a corresponding color liner to dress that compliments it. I now have to take my dress to a fabric store to find a match."
2.0,"I worried the design of this, with two viewing glasses, would look like glasses in person and I was right. It doesn't quite look like two circles and a tassel hanging from my neck  - the circles need to be different sizes to pull this off better. Also, the piece has a bit of a cheap finish to it. It looks more costume jewelry in person than a boutique find. But the thing I dislike the most about this necklace is that it is noisy when I walk in it. I don't know what it hitting what but I sound like a cat with a bell around her neck as I walk through the office."
2.0,It‚Äôs so Small I lost it in the first week!
2.0,"This didn't look cute or sexy like the photos... it sits at the weirdest place on the waist and emphasizes all the wrong elements of one's silhouette.It also makes the shoulders look like a little boys - so, both boyish and weak.  Disappointing."
2.0,They were very sheer and a lot less full looking than the picture shows.
2.0,Too short. Doesn‚Äôt compress right. Don‚Äôt like it.
2.0,"Very small. It was recieved as expected, but a dime would cover the birds up."
2.0,"If you're gonna say purple, let it be purple."
2.0,About 10% did not work/ the light did not turn on.
2.0,I got these for my daughter to wear and the bows came off as she tried to put them on.
2.0,"I had no way to attach these to anything since the product came without clutches. I was able to scrounge up some extras from my house instead of buying completely new ones. I probably would have returned it if the product didn't take so long to be shipped. Otherwise, I was happy with how the pins appeared and functioned. The metal is the perfect weight, heavy enough to not feel like plastic. I wear them all the time."
2.0,The Bows fell off of the shirt on the first wash.
2.0,No me quedo llo pedi xl y me mandaron M
2.0,"XL cups are a B-cup. Product image is a black bra, but product shipped was pink and black - not my style at all. On the positive, this would be a great firm-support bra for an A, B, and possibly a small C cup woman. Shipping was fast and secure."
2.0,Gave it a 2 because of size. It fits 7-9 inch wrist.  Well my wrist is 8 inches and I had quarter inch gaps between beads. So I can't see it being close to 7 inch.
2.0,"I am 5""5' and this hit below the knee.  I didnt think it was flattering for summer but would work for church."
2.0,The blouse is made very cheaply..its too puffed up!
2.0,"My husband never wore this shirt. I returned it because it was too thin. It is too expensive for the thinness. For 30.00, I expected a thicker material. Won't buy these again. Lower the price!"
2.0,"I bought the sweater as a gift for my husband to wear for his Christmas party at work. When we opened it, it does have a musty odor. There are no labels on it with care instructions, or what it's made out of. It fits rather largely, he usually wears XL, so I bought XL and it looks a bit like a bathrobe on him."
2.0,"One of the shoes lights up differently every step. Once he changes the color then steps it switches. Disappointed bc I bought 3 pair, pink, silver and gold/black. 2 out the 3 pairs has the same flaw. Wouldn't recommend at this time."
2.0,It‚Äôs a great watch but it is harder than normal to resize
2.0,"Terrible quality. The seams at the toes are already frayed right out of the box. I doubt they'll last very long. Material is very thin.<br />Weird shape, loose around the heels."
2.0,"I like the look of it. It is very light.<br />Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have much shock absorbing capabilities and arch support. I had ankle and foot pain while using the shoe in racquetball court, which I never had before with Head or Asics court shoes.<br /><br />10/14/2019:<br />Just bought a pair of Adidas court shoe and my ankle and foot pain are gone. Returning this ."
2.0,material is not as described
2.0,It's cute but super small. Was not expecting it that flimsy. Keeps falling!
2.0,I liked the bracelet. I wore it twice and it broke.
2.0,"Gloves, not mittens. My daughter wore once and where the flaps attach its starting to unravel!<br />Would return but she is over three hours away. Disappointed in these."
2.0,"The seller was very responsive to my messages about the shipment being late. Im not sure if a replacement was shipped or if they managed to find the original to me. That earned 2 stars.<br />The masks themselves only get 1. They fit great, but have a horrible odor that will make it impossible for me to wear them. Returning them would be a hassle, so I removed them from the packaging and put them in a paper bag to let them ""breathe"" for a few days. I hope it helps."
2.0,It‚Äôs very cheap not really worth the price.<br />It‚Äôs a gag gift so not a huge deal
2.0,It‚Äôs definately not like the picture looks I got the wine color and it‚Äôs not solid like the picture shows it is more of an off white with the red color as well
2.0,Not as comfortable as stated. Poor quality.
2.0,"A novice/intermediate runner looking for an actual high impact sports bra, which is proving hard to find. Saw positive reviews for this one. Got it in the mail. First thing I noticed was the bulky padded inserts, which were awkward. The material was fine and it fit alright but, upon the first ""bounce test,"" I knew this wasn't a high impact sports bra. May be fine for walking and other low impact exercises, but definitely not one I'd wear on a run of any distance. Will be returning."
2.0,See they and silky fabric not as described
2.0,"The material is smooth and breathes. However, the cut is terrible. It rides in the crotch and digs into the butt crack."
2.0,It‚Äôs of good quality but do not buy if you‚Äôre petite. The sleeves are way way too long that it looked ridiculous on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 115lbs
2.0,"Cute, but horrible quality came apart after a couple wears around the house."
2.0,awkward collar and rather oversized
2.0,The hat is lovely but unfortunately the way it was folded into a small box there is still a great big crease right in the center front of the hat that I can‚Äôt get rid of which is more than a little disappointing as it‚Äôs not really wearable until the crease is out. I am going to try taking it to the dry cleaners to see if can be steamed out.
2.0,Does not as confortable or marshmallows at all. Tight in the instep of the food.
2.0,"Cute leotard and a reasonable price... the rhinestones just started falling off immediately. Disappointing but in comparison to other brands, the price was way better. So I guess that is just the trade off."
2.0,For the size sent it fit as expected which was tight that is because 1x was sent.  So unfortunately...of course it had to go back as I need a 2x.
2.0,Was not pleased with the item
2.0,The clips aren't strong enough and come undone every time I've used them.
2.0,"small, thin fabric"
2.0,"after wearing it for a week, I started to break out around my arm"
2.0,It's kind of small and doesn't hold a lot of hair.  On the plus side my refund request was processed almost immediately.
2.0,All I can tell you i tried them on they did not fit
2.0,"Sized too small, the belt was not as long as it says."
2.0,It didn't look like the picture.
2.0,They looked totally different than the picture. I thought they were brown. They came as a off khakis grey looking color. Not what I expected.
2.0,They fall out of my ears constantly because they are so front heavy.
2.0,"I'm giving this two stars only because these feel like they're made decently well. They definitely aren't plus sized. I was so excited for these too! The tops have like no stretch so if you're legs are even a little thick, don't waste your money."
2.0,Very pretty and super fast shipping! Only problem... it was ripped from the spaghetti strap super disappointed!
2.0,It‚Äôs heavy and isn‚Äôt the same material from the poncho that Clint used in the movie.
2.0,"Wonderful watch.  Attempted to change the battery and learned that it would not start.  Believe it to be an electrical product.  Requested a replacement, but no response from the manufacturer."
2.0,"These are buttery soft, fit well, but they attract lint and dog hair."
2.0,Cute but definitely not small
2.0,"Two of the four pairs ripped within the 24 hours I wore them (one split at the legs vertically, the other ripped open a new fly on the opposite side of the fly area. This was the first time I wore either pair. The other two pairs are still in fine condition after 3-4 uses, so I have no idea what the difference was, outside of perhaps a different manufacture date."
2.0,This product does not work well for a mask or for changing temperatures i work in and out of coolers all day and even changing from 40 to 70 degrees have a full fog layer on my glasses wearing a mask is just as poor performance
2.0,it was pretty but kept snagging my clothes and when i took it off it broke.
2.0,"Material is super cheap. Not flattering material at all. I bought this, didn't return it in time, now I'm stuck with it."
2.0,Did not feel the dress was worth the price. It wad a pretty color and the length was great just did not like the material. Returned.
2.0,"I was disappointed. This is  very nice outfit I bought for my 13 yr old son who is a little husky.  He has broad shoulders and a non-flat derriere. Unfortunately the pants portions did not go past his thighs. The shirt looked nice but fitted, not loose and comfortable. I bought about 2 sizes up(16/18) thinking it should be perfect for my 13 year old but unfortunately I was mistaken. Nevertheless it is a beautiful outfit just beautiful with sizing."
2.0,This purse was smaller than I was expecting and didn't look like that good quality.
2.0,"Look nice in the picture but after i got it i was very disappointed, it's not what i am expected! not satisfied with the quality."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt stiffen my felt hat very well
2.0,"I purchased this as a gift. Since I have several pairs of Russell dri-power sweatpants, I expected the same thickness and warmth, unfortunately it was not equal.  Again, I purchased this based on my experience with the same brand sweatpants, I was disappointed!"
2.0,Broke within a week. My boot do have metal eyelets but this has never caused a problem before
2.0,This romper looks really cute on and fits well BUT the fabric is so cheap that mine has busted 3 times already. Luckily it was all on seems and I could fix it but it is ridiculous that it has done that. It isn't even tight on those seems for it to bust. It looks so cute on that I will keep fixing it.
2.0,Cute but runs really small and very thin material.
2.0,plastic frame brakes very easy
2.0,Return product does not fit
2.0,Bought a 2XL for my husband and it's way too small.
2.0,Pants look great but are not really durable. The stitching is coming off.
2.0,"Cute and fits well, just sewn crooked.  I had to take to a local tailor and pay 2x what I paid for the shirt to have them fix it so the lines were even with the seams."
2.0,Nice quality but wrong size.
2.0,The one I got is more yellowed than stone washed white
2.0,I'm baffled to even give a review.
2.0,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED.  I THOUGHT IT LOOKED CHEAP -- BUT IT DIDN'T COST VERY MUCH, SO I GUESS I CAN'T COMPLAIN."
2.0,We followed the instructions but it immediately started to peel off
2.0,Very poor quality and poor fit.
2.0,"Eb las imagenes se ve claramente que las gafas y el estuche vienen marcados, lo cual es conoletamente falso"
2.0,Everything as described but there were multiple rips in the outfit I didn‚Äôt have time to order another before I needed it so I returned the item. The split in the back does go high up right to the buttocks so go a size or two up depending on how wide your hips are and stitch up the split a little.
2.0,The rubber part that goes over the nose keeps falling off so my son won't wear them; he says its uncomfortable.
2.0,The quality of vision is now the same . PER GLASSES.
2.0,This was not sturdy enough wind blew it down and broke the umberella the hindges that holds the umberella up. Not able to use now.
2.0,"These are cute, but they are not plated enough to be compared to Swarovski. The crystals maybe, but the metal feels and looks cheap. They are great for wearing once or twice maybe for fun. If the metal was better then they‚Äôd be a great pair of costume earrings to wear over the years on ocasion."
2.0,"The color and beauty of this watch was really great!!!  I love it.  But the first time I wore it, I noticed the time would stop and start over and over again.  If they would have sent me a new battery, I probably would have kept it."
2.0,Cute and love the strap.It very small and cheaper at coach outlet!
2.0,This product is small I should have got a medium thinking of I should return it or what.
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but the color isn‚Äôt as it appears online."
2.0,Not the quality for my usage.
2.0,Cute but not very comfy on the instep of foot
2.0,"Product matched what was shown on website however is cheaply made and larger than expected.<br />This definitely looks like costume jewelry, the gold is just a bit &#34;too&#34; shiny, in that fake gold chain sort of way.<br /><br />I was looking for something delicate and stylish. This didn't quite meet my expectation.<br />Necklaces are perfectly fine, just more suited to children or teens than an adult. I'll be giving them to my 11 year old daughter in her stocking and I'm sure she'll love them!"
2.0,Obviously a costume prop. Bought this for my son. The fit was snug and the material was poor. I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Too expensive for what it is. However it is cute.
2.0,Short in length. Extremely cheap squeaky fabric. Decal is nice. Colorful. Wasn't a match for my sensory sensitive kid.
2.0,Can't set alarm and it goes off every hour!
2.0,"Great material, soft and lightweight just wish it was true to size. Ordered 1 size larger than I wear, can‚Äôt fit the tank over my boobs."
2.0,Pretty cheap. I have bought higher quality jewelry at Claire‚Äôs. The gold finish looks really fake.
2.0,Link securing the crossbow to the skull came off and was lost almost immediately. Need to use better materials even on this cheap jewelry.
2.0,"I got XL and I am not that big and weigh 200 lbs, with a 36 - 38 waist, too small need a XXL."
2.0,"Super cute, arrived on time, but it fell apart after just two washes! Everyone loved it and we were so disappointed to have stitching fall out so quickly. She only got to wear it twice."
2.0,This was a gag gift for my be but they were so small he couldn't even get them on. Quality was what was expected for price but still a waste of money
2.0,"Really wanted to liken this. Not an everyday swimmer, bought this as an extra pair of googles. While the look and feel are ok, they are not light and a little uncomfortable on the nose, to my surprise doesn‚Äôt bring extra adjustable nose clips. View is also a limited due design on edges while swimming. Like the carrying case lock system, and the back adjust method on the back also."
2.0,The jewel itself is too big to be dainty and cute.
2.0,"I really thought I‚Äôd like these pajamas, but realized that they weren‚Äôt as cute as I‚Äôd hoped when my husband asked, ‚Äúwhat is going on with those pjs?‚Äù And before you start thinking it, I wasn‚Äôt hurt because I knew what he meant. They made me look like a confused Victorian woman! There are long sleeves, a scalloped/ruffle neck and hem. Really, I look like a woman who couldn‚Äôt decide if she wanted to be hip or conservative. Here is a summary. The GOOD THINGS: (1) the color is a pretty (periwinkle) blue; (2) The fabric is thicker than a tee-shirt and moderately comfortable. AND finally (3) these pajamas have pockets. Who doesn‚Äôt like a good pocket? BAD THINGS: (1) The pockets. Ok, while they seem cool and a nice style design, the question remains why do you really need pockets in your pajamas? The most you can do is bury your hands in them so really what is the point.  (2) The top fits kind of like a mid-drift of sorts. And the shorts are kind of short. (3) The neck and hem are scalloped/ruffled. An element design which should have been cute, but again wasn‚Äôt very flattering at all. (4) The sleeves. They are  really long, gather and ‚Äúbloom‚Äù at the wrist. Awkward and my husband really didn‚Äôt like the sleeves. I mean, I was questioning them too. So why would you have a mock-neck, long sleeved shirt with short shorts?  To be honest, these design elements work separately but not together. I selected them and gave them the old college try. In conclusion, overall, I would only give these pajamas 2 stars and that is for the color. While from the photo all of these pajamas made it seem like it would work, they don‚Äôt. On me, they were ill fitting and not flattering at all."
2.0,Huge... I'm a size 4. Also item is very thin.
2.0,"For jewellery, it's okay. For silver or silverplate flateware and serving pieces, use the old fashion 'Wrights Silver Polish'. You shall save yourself a great deal of time and elbow-grease with a much brighter, clean shine!!!"
2.0,"This purse was cute just finally used it after purchase within 1/2 and hour the chain broke completely and I was unable to use it in my need. Carrying it was a true pain. I wouldn't recommend this product, unless you plan on carrying it all over which I feel like it's way to big without the chain."
2.0,Too small  and uncomfortable
2.0,"Top fits too big in the bust size, otherwise it's a nice suit"
2.0,"Unfortunately, the fit was not as expected. The top was ok but the bottoms were too small. It was a medium and it was for my daughter. She‚Äôs normal to petite size. Pretty much the perfect shape and size for a 17 year old. It should have fit with room to spare. It was disappointing as it was a Christmas gift."
2.0,Exchanging for (hopefully) one that is made properly. Neck line on the one I received was completely crooked. UPDATE: Second dress was also improperly made. Swiss dots across the chest were crooked again.
2.0,My daughter is 9 so I bought an 8/9. It's too small. The quality isn't as good as I thought it would be for the price.
2.0,The metal parts looked faded
2.0,very comfortable but Left Foot is not fitting properly..it looks like defective piece..i liked this  very comfy..but my foot moved in side the shoe...
2.0,"Let me start by saying that I‚Äôve been wearing reef sandals for 15 years. They‚Äôre my go to.<br /><br />These do not fit like all my other 5 or so pairs of reefs that have lasted me through the years. The soul and arch is what you would expect, comfortable and wearable all day. But, the strap is huge!  Normally they would start a little tight then break in enough to be perfect. Not these.  I didn‚Äôt notice it at first, but after 8 hours fishing and wading through water they‚Äôre so loose my foot would slip sideways off the sandal when walking up or down a hill over rocks.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt know if I got a fluke, but I would never buy draftmans again without trying them on first if I ever even buy reefs again.<br /><br />4 stars for the soul. 0 stars for the strap."
2.0,I still get plenty of glare from on coming head lights.
2.0,"It fits, and it looks okay. However, it's PRINTED not embroidered, so I don't know how long it'll look good."
2.0,Arrived on time but jewelry was not annealed and captive ball was made with dimples crooked. For the price this was ridiculous.
2.0,Normally a medium so I sized up based on other reviews. I ordered a large and it was too small.
2.0,"Although it's very thin, it is a very pretty dress. The yellow is bright and vivid. I am 5'8 ,the dress is long. I can wear 3 inch heels, it will fall at my ankles.  Unfortunately, my dress had a 3 inch hole in the back which sucks. It was hard getting a refund from seller. Amazon had to resolve the matter."
2.0,"It's very wide in the torso, but also too short."
2.0,"The outer layer is a really cheap, stiff fabric.  Runs very small.  Inside is soft and warm.  I sent it back, because I was disappointed"
2.0,"Cheap, could have been so cute"
2.0,"the color is not true to the picture shown, I got a dark rose color gold and I like light yellow gold."
2.0,"As for me, when people stated it ran &#34;small&#34; I went larger. I'm a size 10 and I got an xl and L both were too big. Returned both. The Jean material was poor quality also. Like Kmart type pants. Loved the flowers but not worth buying."
2.0,"To small, wasaaaaaay to tight - straight cut. If you have curves it won‚Äôt fit."
2.0,"These pants are cute online, but the material is thin so wear dark underwear. Also the pants do not stay put. Gives you plumbers butt when doing exercises that require you to bend over or sit up."
2.0,This was not as large as expected and tight on my son's head. It is a nice looking hat but too small. If you have a smaller sized head this would be good though.
2.0,ordered a XL ..but it fit my friend thats a size 6....
2.0,I was really looking forward to a phone case that I could also use as a wallet and better yet a cross body wallet. But this one is not the one. The card slots doesn't close all the way and there is a big gap which I really wish it didn't have. There is no way I am storing my credit cards or money in that. It can also be hard to store your phone in the slot if you have already have a chunkier phone case. Overall I wouldn't recommend this cross body.
2.0,I am disappointed.  This hat is rigid and has a hard finish.
2.0,The sweater design is beautiful but by the end of the day it had little pills all over it. Disappointing.
2.0,I went with a xxx large thinking that it would fit me. i didn't really understand the sizing. so i am trying to return it to go with a 2x big. But wow! the print was sooo pretty. If i get a new size and it fits i will buy all the prints.
2.0,Watch was small for me. I gave it away as a gift. Much smaller than in photo.
2.0,One out of four was a bit too small. They were all a bit too clingy for my 64 year old body.  Great colors and really soft. Loved the length.  Would be good for a woman younger than me.
2.0,I had this handbag for about 7 months but a few things were off. The stiches were off in a few places and one of my zipper is out.
2.0,"Extremely thin material. I expected it to be stretchy material, but it is not. The stitching is very flimsy and I would think it would rip very easily. The picture shows a dress, but this is more of a long shirt that must be worn with leggings. There are slits on the sides that went all the way up to my underwear!"
2.0,"The backside is too low, they fall down constantly. Fits good everywhere else. Washing them does not help. Super disappointed I really like the fabric and colors."
2.0,"They are okay, thinner material than I expected and gets wrinkled real fast. Think undershirt material. At least they fit as expected. A lot of tamk tops are sized to small for the zero fat crowd to show off. These don‚Äôt do that."
2.0,Too many small and mini stones
2.0,2 of the pieces have already fallen off
2.0,It‚Äôs not very loud.
2.0,"My husband and I ordered the Ghostbusters ghost trap for our 5 year old grandson. The good thing is that it was delivered the day of his party and we didn‚Äôt open the box until he opened it at the party. It looks great, but has NO MOVING PARTS. #disappointedbirthdayboy&grandparents"
2.0,Bought extra size no way..gave 2 stars only cuz I didn't like the fabric and didn't catch that on description
2.0,"Boxy and cheap material, you get what you pay for. I returned mine."
2.0,The cap was too tight. The glasses uncomfortable
2.0,The bottom diamond was way bigger than I expected
2.0,"This is really a cute, warm and comfortable coat. I bought it for the warmth and the length. The problem is the zipper failed and I was left to freeze"
2.0,"the material is silver metal (like acero quirurgico) dont know in english, the piece that should hold the size on your wrisk it moves... so you need to make it tide often."
2.0,too bulky and closure makes it hard to put large glass frames in it.
2.0,My hammer toe rubbed against the top of shoe
2.0,"I loved the embroidered detail on the sleeves because it added a feminine touch and made an otherwise boring top look fun, but the fit was awful.  I am busty so the midsection of the top stuck out due to my large bust, meaning, the top was not fitted and did not hug my body at all.  The back seemed longer than the front and covered my butt, making me look flat from the back, so it essentially looked like a baggy tunic that was doing my body no favors.  I like my tops to be fitted and the fit on this one was just plain odd, so I decided to return it."
2.0,"Cheap quality, very thin material. Sleeves are a little shirt."
2.0,This product was a disappointment. While it does resemble the product in the picture it looks like an incredible cheap knock off version. I ordered up a size to ensure it would fit and it did but the skirt is very sheer and the color is incredibly off. I ordered the gold and it looks like a dark brown . The top is a little small and it hurts my neck.
2.0,"Have no idea what they mean by ‚Äúsheerness‚Äù but the spikes are sharp. Used gorilla glue on the nuts and no problems with the spikes coming out. My problem was with the fit. It is NOT one size fits all. I wear a size 7.5 shoe. Even after adjusting the straps it was clear these shoes were made for a man. Was like I was a kid playing dress-up again. I tripped several times by stepping on the straps, since I had to tighten them so much. Make sure to fit the shoes before you start your project."
2.0,"The top of this dress was way too big on me.  I'm a 32A and ordered a size small.  Really bummed I have to return this because I really like the dress, but not for me. The straps are adjustable and it has a lining."
2.0,"For nearly $12 I expect some very nice socks!  These are thin and cheap.  The pattern is cute, but that is it.  Worth about $3."
2.0,"Fit was nice, but the fabric is see-through."
2.0,"Full disclosure, I had very low expectations to begin with. Somehow they weren't low enough. The watch came before the expected date but was smaller than advertised with a much smaller than expected band. The looks are great, the fit is terrible."
2.0,"I like these, and will keep them. They are baggy in the knees, and I don't like that. I won't order from them again!"
2.0,"This is a hard review for me to write because I am not for sure exactly how to explain this shirt, but I will try. First of all, it looks like the material is that paper kind of crinkly stuff, it is not. It is actually really soft cotton. It is a nice looking shirt and the lace is very pretty. The buttons are nice pearl looking buttons. It is longer in the front than in the back and that may be my problem with it. I have a large bust and I ma a lot bigger on the top than the bottom. The shirt did not dip too low in the front - as I thought it might. It actually laid nicely on my chest and neckline. That made the problem of the back worse. It just looks horrible from the back and side. I don't know if it was the cut of the shirt or the length, but it looked awful. It made me look about four times bigger from the side and back than I am. I actually tried to think of a way to sew it to make it look better on me because it was so cute on the front. But I could never figure it out so I returned it. I can't get over how good it looked in the front and how bad it was in the back. I have never had that happen to me. I read the reviews and no else really described this experience. So maybe it was sewed wrong or my shape does not allow for this kind of shirt. Buyer beware..."
2.0,not for petite ladies. Super large with abnormal portions
2.0,I ordered an XL but it‚Äôs more like a M-L in all areas especially the length.  Very disappointing
2.0,"Eh, you get what you paid for. These fell off the chair once and got scraped up so bad that I just tossed them."
2.0,I ordered a 2x and it was WAY too small.  Usually 2x clothes are very loose on me!  I had to return the item.  It was also not as long as it looks in the picture.
2.0,Ligeramente grande y peque√±os defectos
2.0,"The print of the galaxy hat I received was very low quality; the hat looked nothing like the picture presented in Amazon. It seems that other people and myself are disappointed with the full print hats, but others are happy with the brim-printed hats.<br /><br />If you choose to roll the dice with this product, get a brim-print. The full print hats from this vendor look like s***."
2.0,Dangerous to wear these if it is the least bit icy or patchy ice on concrete has icy patches. They might work in snow otherwise dangerous to wear.
2.0,Not that sticky. Keep coming off.
2.0,The chain broke within a few days of my Grandaughter wearing it!
2.0,Much lighter in color than shown
2.0,I thought I knew what I was getting when I ordered this hat but it is too large and looks  odd. My sons will not let me wear it with them in public üòÅ I‚Äôm sure it is a fine hat though.
2.0,Itchy polyester fabric
2.0,fit tight
2.0,Huge and not structured. Don't invest your money unless you have really big shoulders.
2.0,Not a completing shirt with large chest.
2.0,"Can't really comment on the quality, so small I couldn't wear them. I'm a US size 12/14"
2.0,"This is really a good looking piece of jewelry however, one of the red stones was missing. I think I would have given more stars if I had at least found the missing piece inside the box...NO such luck. I blame this big boo-boo on poor workmanship and very poor packaging. I could hear the necklace rattling around inside the box the minute i received it."
2.0,"Waist line came waaaayyy too high and made me look like I was wearing a mater dress. It would be cute as a maternity dress, but it‚Äôs not cute if you don‚Äôt want it to be one!"
2.0,Cute but small for size and very short
2.0,"The tag is sewn into the seam, and is not a soft tag, but a very scratchy one. The only way to get relief is to cut it completely out, which opens up the seam. Can't give it 5 stars, because the tag makes it so uncomfortable."
2.0,"Very cute, needs several links taken out. Large face of watch. The face of watch does have some scratches on it."
2.0,"For being real silver, they tarnished pretty quickly. Bought 2 pairs for my self and my cousin. Both of us experienced the same. Tried cleaning but it didn‚Äôt work as it should have. A bit disappointed as they were very pretty the few times I did wear them Though they were significantly heavier than I expected them to be. 2 stars for being pretty, but wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
2.0,"This dress is very matronly on me.  I am older, so maybe that's why it wasn't flattering at all.  Too much material and the print is too loud.  I am 5'4&#34; and it almost touches the ground."
2.0,This doesn‚Äôt fit right according to the picture.
2.0,It‚Äôs ok.... it really does not sit off the shoulder tho
2.0,"Wore one time and washed and now only one will stay up, the other falls after a hour of walking"
2.0,Fade.
2.0,"Meh, these are ok I guess.  I have the top of my ear pierced and these are way too small.  Would maybe be better for a deformed person with tiny ears.  I finally fit the thing on but it just hurt the whole time."
2.0,no era lo q esperaba
2.0,Its so cute but not too warm. The ears ar√© not covered and with low temperature your ears Get frozen!
2.0,"These shoes were cute and well made. I really wanted to keep them, but they would not stay on my daughter‚Äôs feet, even though I bought the correct size. Within 5 minutes of wearing them, they‚Äôd just come off as she walked around."
2.0,"This was exactly what I expected. However, the front zipper was broken.  I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to wear it. I returned it and will not purchase it again."
2.0,"Looks good, but tissue thin! Runs truly true to size might consider a size bigger!"
2.0,It‚Äôs not for one year and a half! Very small
2.0,returned because face was too big.
2.0,"It says to size down for 4 hole shoes, but it understates how much, a lot.  I am wearing size 10 (Womens) 4 hole shoes.  The size 2 (already down one size) is able to go through all the holes on both sides twice and still be loose - it is also too large for my 6 hole sneakers.  I believe it will need two sizes smaller than that for the 4 hole shoes(so 3 down, total)."
2.0,"The bracelet itself is technically good quality and reasonable price BUT it's very tiny. It barely fits on my wrist and absolutely would not fit on a larger person. It says easily adjustable but it's pretty solid, it couldn't easily be stretched out. Also, it says it comes in a gift box and it didn't."
2.0,"They are a little big, but I would have kept them except for the very uncomfortable seam along the top. It wasn't sealed or sewn down all the way so it would rub and fold against my skin as my foot moved in the shoe. I am going to return them."
2.0,easily breaks when trying to put on.<br />very difficult to place button into hole
2.0,"Ordered 3T for my 2 year old, and they barely cover his belly after one wash.  Cute designs, cheap fabric and too small.  I would't recommend."
2.0,Very very tiny! Had to return.
2.0,"the fabric tag says it's only 13% bamboo, so... And though initially seeming to have OK cushioning, after a couple of weeks the cushioning compressed to practically nothing. And this product runs way large. Practically worthless."
2.0,"I only gave 2stars based on the look, 1st pair the zipper broke, 2nd pair fits ok zipper does seems super fragile and they are extremely too long and very thin material.. Not for cold weather"
2.0,"Cute shirt, but don't dry it!.<br />I guess i thought i was buying a cotton t-shirt but it's more a polyester blend.so it's not cool and it shrank."
2.0,"I'm typically a modern day US 8, I ordered a large and it fit how I wanted it to fit- figure hugging, lots of cleavage and flattering on the waist. I planned to wear it with a blazer to class up the cleave at 39, however heading for the door the first day my husband said wow, the red under the boobs is interesting! It was my bra.... where the chest portion of the top meets the bottom- I have curves but there are not sharp pokey objects on me to rip seams and I hadn't even washed it yet!! If you know how to sew this shirt is for you- if not maybe avoid it and find something higher quality. Thankfully he saw me and I didn't venture into the world with under boob bra exposed."
2.0,"Very small for an adult, more of a large child size. The bottom was sewn so some parts of the letters were gone. Does not fit well over nose. I did like the adjustable straps though!"
2.0,"Too small. Go up 1, maybe 2 sizes"
2.0,"Very small. My daughter is a 10, knowing Asian sizing I ordered larger...still too small."
2.0,"This blouse is actually nicely made, but runs small in the chest and waist. Everything else was perfect. Ordered a Med. 5'10"" and 148lbs. Athletic build. It fit more like a Jr. On the fence about ordering a large because the fit was perfect everywhere else. It's definitely a beautiful blouse and I highly recommend it if you're lucky enough to get one that fits."
2.0,Very small as compared to picture
2.0,Chain broke very quickly. I thought that being stainless steel it was going to last for a long time. Very disappointed!
2.0,"Upside, I loved the image of Patty and earthy orange color.<br />Downside, the armpits started splitting at the seems, and fabric got small fuzzy knots. Lasted me only three washes."
2.0,"i have very very small boobs. i am a 32 A. Everyone can see my nipples because this is so thin. the picture is a lie, and you nipples will show through."
2.0,"Material wasn't what I hoped for and it's too long for me (5'4"")."
2.0,Very disappointed with this bag - the images make it seem MUCH larger than it is as does the description - but the opening alone is small - reduced even more in size by the strap that obscures the opening. And even when the seller answers questions about fitting a laptop - it makes the reader think one will fit. And beware - a laptop - hey not even an iPad Air 2 will fit in this bag.<br /><br />Having said that it is pretty - hence the 2 star review rating and not a one star
2.0,It Is not sticking there for more than hour.
2.0,"Has the ability to be an awesome keychain but right where the tear drop mounts to the keychain they use a cheap screw to hold it together. So after maybe a week I noticed it was unscrewing itself and you can't tighten it back up, it just feel off one day :("
2.0,very POOR QUALITY
2.0,At first I was excited about the lights for my brown puppy. It was great to be able to see the blinking light to let me see where she was in the yard in the dark. Unfortunately the battery didn't last long and I will have to find another product to purchase. Very disappointed.
2.0,To big - looks silly - have to fold it in half to use it.
2.0,The pendant was nice but the rope broke immediately.
2.0,"Sadly disappointed! While they are cute socks, they do not support the compression I was looking for to keep me moving during my 12 HR shifts! Better luck next time I suppose"
2.0,"The material is a bit thin and not too soft, but the length is good and the style is just as in the picture with the scallop hem and sleeves being a good cute size"
2.0,"Claimed it was XL/12-14, but it fits like 7-8. Had to use in a bind, otherwise, I would have returned it."
2.0,"This would be a great dress if it had been made from usual cotton fabric, it would have been great! But it is made from a cloth that has a plastic lining on the inside like a raincoat has and is very hot to wear. Beautiful styling, but they lost it on the choice of fabric. Disappointed.  I will hope that maybe the plastic coating will wash away with hot water after several washings."
2.0,Earring was broken
2.0,You can't walk in them.
2.0,There is no coverage in the front. These work as long as you only leak through in the back.
2.0,"Love the print on this shirt, but it's kind of boxy... the decal also started to peel off after just one wash :("
2.0,"These shorts appear to be super soft, almost a jersey type material and flowy....they are not like that at all. I should have read what material they were made of but the picture showed a jersey material which is not at all accurate"
2.0,Very  disappointed in it. I felt very unstable. They went back
2.0,"Although quite unique in design, this bracelet did not last 6 months.<br /><br />Would advise the money would be better spent if you saved and bought an authentic piece of gold/onyx bracelet; something I am happy with."
2.0,"Wore 1 time and one for the bottom loops popped. Although, very true to size and cute"
2.0,Looks good but smells horrible even after 3 washes.
2.0,I wanted to like wearing this visor but when it arrived it was bent and could not be unbent so I had to return this. The visor itself is very nice looking and has the potential to block the sun but because it came damaged it looked crooked when I tried to wear it. I wish it could have been packaged a little better to prevent this.
2.0,"I've worn the posture shirt almost daily for almost 2 weeks.<br />Also, I'm wearing it for about 8-10 hours per day.<br />It's snug as it is meant to be but comfortable.<br />I've not noticed any ""posture"" benefit yet.<br />I'm beginning to think that I may have wasted my money.<br />I'll continue wearing it for at least a couple of months in order<br />to see if the shirt truly does help to improve posture.<br />The shirt is expensive - a rip-off if it doesn't do as was<br />advertised.  At this point, I would not recommend purchasing<br />what may be a gimmick.  I'll see what happens over the next<br />2 months."
2.0,"I‚Äôm really upset because I love the shoes but they are wayyyyy too big. Because they offer no half sizes, I had To order my larger size, when I really am a 10.5. But I think I should have sized down on these and got a 10. And I think I‚Äôm screwed because I‚Äôm disabled and have no way to get to a place to return them . Please send me a smaller pair so I can review them properly!"
2.0,The good:  The color is vivid and vibrant.<br /><br />The bad:  It is a wonderfully colored potato sack.  A comforter with a paperclip has more shape than this ensemble.
2.0,I feel like my boobs point to the left and right. not straight.... looks funny on me.
2.0,Very cheap fabric and ill fitting.
2.0,Ran small in the bust area and material felt weird... the print is beautiful but the color was off I couldn't tell if it was a greenish grey
2.0,"Comfortable cotton, but fit runs very small."
2.0,Padding is very uncomfortable!
2.0,"Just recieved this necklace. I was very excited about this but the placement of the stone is off and is not placed straight. I know $10 isnt that much but I did expect more for what I paid,<br />With that said, I do really like the necklace and it is smaller and daintier than expected (which is a good thing), but Im just not sure what Im going to do, whether I should return it or just hope I can get over the fact that the stone is crooked :("
2.0,The material of these is very thin. Zipper broke after 1 wear.
2.0,"Description does not accurately say how many you will receive. Picture shows 6 pieces, I only received 3 and they were natural colors, not colorful like the picture. They were very nice quality and nice size. Just inaccurately described. Returned for a refund."
2.0,"I had these and they did look OK, however very small and nothing to hold them on, so of course, I lost one!"
2.0,The material was soft but the seams were straingly tight
2.0,Love the saying. The shirt isn‚Äôt good quality and the straps are super thin. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
2.0,"I was really excited for this item but was honestly really disappointed by the quality. If you‚Äôre like me and built like a rectangle the shorts might look weird on you. They don‚Äôt form to my body so my thighs feel squeezed. The top is cute, had to wash it like 10 times to get the starchy feeling out."
2.0,Very nice dress was just to small in the chest had to return it
2.0,Nips show through
2.0,"The dress is absolutely adorable but the sizing is not good.  If you are at all petite, it will be way too long.  Even with pretty high wedges there was still about 2 inches hanging on the ground.  Also several others have commented on the sleeves.  They are very tight.  Super disappointed.  I don't generally return things but this one I did."
2.0,"Good belt . Ordered a size 38 , was sent size 36 . Because of construction was able to use what was sent . Ordered gold buckle ; invoice said silver AND size 38 . Not so fast ...got size 36 and good buckle ."
2.0,Ordered my regular size and I wouldn't even try to put this on...would never get it off.
2.0,"There was no structural arch support in these slippers. It had a very thin, soft, and flimsy insert (with a slight arch-curve) over a flat sole. Liked the idea that there was some adjustment possible, so I gave it two stars. Sent them back."
2.0,"These bracelets are super cute and comes in three different colors that you can mix them up.<br />Unfortunately, after two wears I noticed them going green. They do tarnish and if you have a reaction to metals, like my sister, I suggest you avoid these."
2.0,I didn't like the material as much
2.0,The grey color is sheer. Completely see-through. The fit is snug/fitted.
2.0,"Super disappointed that this dress was so poor quality, it had loose threads at the seams. The bag it came in also had a scented smell like old perfume that was awful. I am petite but the dress was long and I looked like an episode of Little House on the Prairie.  For the price i wasn't expecting it to be outstanding but this is just below average."
2.0,"I ordered a large. 5‚Äô3‚Äù normally wear a small or medium. Expected this to be softer and loose fitting. If I order a large in a sweatshirt it normally hangs to my upper thigh and is very baggy. This was more like a fitted size medium. Not happy with it, I wanted more of an oversized with leggings look. So, maybe double size up if you want baggy."
2.0,Returned for refund. Too tight in bust line.
2.0,I had higher hopes for this but it is made of extremely cheap materials.  Don't recommend
2.0,"Just what I needed-not that breathable however, but it's great for shorter rides, lightweight, visible and keeps me dry. Update: fiappointed that zipper broke and jsmmed  3rd time using"
2.0,"One sock was between an inch & a half to two inches shorter than the other. This is annoying to my husband & disappointing to me given it was a Christmas gift for him & the socks are pricey. The other pair I got him were fine. The socks are quite soft, warm & comfy. We will order more & I would give 5 stars if the issue is corrected."
2.0,Pants are too small with very tiny seams.  My husband is thin and split the crotch.  Material is not particularly soft which you would expect from comfort clothing
2.0,Had trouble figuring out which size my son needed. When it arrived it was to large for him. Luckily it was just big enough to fit our three your old. Now she loves wearing it.
2.0,Looks cheap & feels cheap.
2.0,"I like the look and feel of the material, but the fit is too small. I‚Äôm 6 foot, 200 lbs and ordered the XXX-Large and it fits more like a medium."
2.0,"Too long to be a shirt and WAY too short to be a dress. One step and my lady parts would be on full display. Also basically a tshirt dress, pic makes it look more flowy than it is."
2.0,"The ring is over all very detailed and looks amazing, my only down is that it has started to turn my husbands finger green, not very happy with that since it was bought to use as a wedding band."
2.0,"Liked the colors and patterns on it, but runs very small and the cups are to large also the metal under wire on the cups was popping on the left side one.. Perfect if your petit and have large breast."
2.0,"Very soft, collar is a bit odd. Has a couple small holes right in the front, will return."
2.0,These are way to small and tight. Might be good for a kid or a woman but not for a grown man
2.0,The quality of the product is misleading by the images provided. I am disappointed in the amount of plastic.
2.0,The apple is huge and cheap looking. It cannot be worn as a necklace without looking ridiculous.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Get what you pay for with this product definitely. The color makes them look even more cheap.
2.0,Didn't fit but it may work for you.
2.0,It looks nice but it's too small for me
2.0,picture gives the impression the set is more delicate. The golden color looks too bright which makes it look too fake. The 3 necklaces are inseparable. you have to wear them together.
2.0,The first time I wore it the zipper kept on separating all day. I mean that's never a tolerable thing when you have a zipper. It fit well and looked good.
2.0,The top of the pantie is to soft and stretchy and rolls down.  Not a tight fit.  I ordered the small/med.
2.0,I ordered the xl and could have used at least one size smaller in the bottoms and maybe a size larger in the top. The top comes so far up under the arm it‚Äôs almost uncomfortable and definitely not made for ladies with anymore than a c-d cup.
2.0,"disappointed by the size , very small"
2.0,Thin material and slim cut. Did not fit this fat guy
2.0,Product was too small and not a great quality.
2.0,"Doesn't stay in place on my shoulders. Slides forward, then it feels like your boobs are exposed"
2.0,Adorable but did not fit
2.0,Had many strings hanging from seams and HEM. I am not happy with Quality. Returned item.
2.0,The pockets should have zippers.  The velcrow is too difficult to fight with and takes two hands: one to hold the item you want to put in the pocket and the other to hold the pocket open.  Not easy when you are travelling.  Not cleverly designed.
2.0,Too small; not just the overall size but they barely extend over the palm. This means the plastic curls and ruins the effect
2.0,"While this garment is of good quality and was nicely packaged, I don't feel it lives up to it's claim as a &#34;slimming body shaper.&#34;  I saw no real difference between wearing this garment and a tight shirt.  I would return the garment however the return costs are half the cost of the garment so it doesn't make financial sense to return the same."
2.0,"It was great, the 2 months he had it.  It slid off his finger and completely shattered!! Sorry, but what a waste.  I would NOT recommend this product."
2.0,"They don't stay close!!, whats the point to nice looking earrings and they are nice looking but they don't stay close..."
2.0,It take two people to put it on and falls off regularly
2.0,I thought would be warm for running but went out today at 32 degrees and It felt like I had no pants on! Maybe I‚Äôll wear as an extra layer not solo!
2.0,Tiny. I ordered xxl. It didn't come close. Too bad. Cute shirt. I wear a 12 typically.
2.0,"I have mix feeling, it fits fine from my shoulders to my waist but the arms are too long plus the hole for my 5th finger is is the opposite side. Check pictures. I like it but I won‚Äôt buy it again"
2.0,"I am not a pinhead, or a conehead. This comes in a child's size."
2.0,"This looks totally different in person, looks cheap!!"
2.0,Like - the color<br />Like - neckline<br />Issue - Material is very thin<br />Issue - Sizing seemed inaccurate
2.0,is not like a photho the print in the fabric is diferent
2.0,Chian looks nothing like what's in the picture I received it today very cheap looking would not recommend buying
2.0,The size is way smaller than advertised for this item.
2.0,Very tight fit and too low on top!
2.0,Qued√≥ chico
2.0,"Love the cap topper, EXCEPT the misspelling of ""Phillipians"" like the other reviewers have said. I was able to cover it up by adding more flowers. Its unfortunate."
2.0,The neck on this shirts fits like it is on backwards. I do not like wearing it.
2.0,"Ordered a large, but it runs super small. I'm 5'5&quot; and 145lbs."
2.0,These socks were very uncomfortable. They are extremely thin and tight. They made the bottoms of my feet hurt. I wear a size 7 ladies shoe.
2.0,"This bracelet is actually quite beautiful It looks really stunning when you first open it. I wore it pretty consistently for about two month and the wear was looking to be really good. Then one day the latch wouldn't close, the magnet that kept it shut had fallen off and the bracelet was basically useless. It may have just been a defect on mine, but it was really disappointing because I absolutely loved the way it looked and fit."
2.0,Wayyyy too big
2.0,"These masks are pretty, but the fabric is too thick."
2.0,I used their size guide and it was still too small.  My daughter is normally a size 6 on most brands (she is 5).  I went down a size because of their size guide and it fits her like a size 4.  Returning.  Will just shop at a local store.  Wasn't that impressed with the quality.
2.0,Ordered by mistake.
2.0,This ring turned my nose green and gave me an infection. I wear fake nose rings often and this was not one I would recommend.
2.0,"I ordered the cap sleeve option, but what I received was an off the shoulder style with a thigh high split up the side. Also, I ordered a large and got an XL. When I took the dress out of the bag a bunch of sequins fell off. Now there are sequins all over the couch and the floor. This dress won‚Äôt work for me and I‚Äôm definitely returning it."
2.0,The graphic came off the shirt after only a few washes.
2.0,Had to see/stitch it back together
2.0,My daughter wore these one day to two classes and she had a hole the size of a golf ball... she's very good with her things and we've never had this problem before. There were also other wear marks ... good price but not great quality
2.0,Nice nightgown but defiantly not off the should as picture shows.  More of a V neck.
2.0,Just very thin and not fit as expected
2.0,"It was just ok. The material looked & felt cheap. A lot of times companies will steal pictures of the original piece but make the clothing with cheaper material and sell it for cheap.  So when you buy it, it‚Äôs not the same thing. This seems to have been the case. It didn‚Äôt look as well designed as the picture. I gave it away."
2.0,Don't love it
2.0,This jacket is huge
2.0,I ordered this following the size guide and what I received is for a woman MUCH larger than me. It's almost offensive how big it is. It's unwearable. Whoever is doing the sizing on this item is doing a terrible job. I don't recommend buying this.
2.0,"The yellow color was perfect but even with adjusting the straps, the dress length was several inches shorter than described here, which makes it a dealbreaker for me at 6' tall.  Plus the fabric was a supper scratchy, knit-like weirdness.  I did Love that it had pockets. Returned."
2.0,Good quality material but it is very small and hard to get through their heads to
2.0,"The picture matched up with &#34;eclectic blue&#34; does not match the actual pattern at all. I was expecting the black and white design in the image (I guess I thought the black might actually be blue, explaining the name. I would have been ok with it if it had been this design in blue). Instead, the umbrella I got is black with a dark blue paisley design. It's not my favorite, but not worth returning."
2.0,"I'm kind of mad about this shirt. I love the style and the fabric but the tops shrunk at least one size, mostly in the vertical direction. It does not fit like it does on the model after you wash it. I bought a Medium, my actual size, first. It shrunk to a small, so I bought a Large. This shrunk past the point of being a Medium, and hits so high in the front it feels awkward to wear with leggings. So I bought an XL, but after washing it STILL looks to high in the front (and doesn't cover the butt) but is now too wide. I don't know anymore. I bought a couple at a time, expecting them to work, for staples in my closet, so now I have 5 of them. They're okay but not nice and long like in the photo. For washing them I did cold water and hung up to dry."
2.0,The top did not fit like I expected and wanted it to fit had to give to my daughter it was to small for me the top is cute but the fit is not cute disappointed
2.0,This dress had stains in the arm pits. I had to scrub it and then wash it. It appears to have come out but I was disappointed to have received a dress that had been worn prior to me getting it.
2.0,"Super thin material, not as hardy as it looks on picture or per description, certainly not worth 40 dollars."
2.0,Wayyy too big and not great quality
2.0,Not worth the money in my opinion.  My kid put holes in them really fast and I have thrown some out already only like 2 months after getting them.  And his toe nails are kept short.  Better quality with buying Fruit of the Loom ones from my local Walmart.
2.0,"Received the luggage with no directions, and a locked bag.  I am now digging around on the internet trying to figure out how to open it.  Unfortunately, I ordered before I needed it, and I just passed the return window.  Net, it seems like a great that I don't have the ability to open."
2.0,"I didn't like these glasses, because their too dark in the day time and you can't see anything. You really see better without these glasses."
2.0,Everything seems reasonably high quality until you apply moderate force (no more than needed to press the backplate of a watch in) in which case the toggle link on the front sheared off.
2.0,It is uncomfortable.
2.0,Purchased a large for my teenager and it was too small.
2.0,"My siblings and I purchased these glasses for our father, who has been color blind his entire life. He did not see any difference when first wearing them - for the first 20 minutes and another 10 minutes on day 2. It's likely he will not spend the recommended adjustment time to see if he can get better results. So this purchase was kind of a waste. We were really hoping for immediate results - even though the information said that it could take time."
2.0,Looked great until I washed it once then the fabric fuzzed like it had been worn 100 times.
2.0,"I got this when it was on sale recently, but sadly had to return it.  It is NOT cut well for a plus size bust.  I bought the XXL, and based on the measurements in the listing, I thought it was going to be a weight-loss goal dress, but I was able to pull it on over my head easily (my measurements are approximately 49-40-52).  However, that under-bust seam was not under my bust, but right across it.  My chest is large but proportionate to the rest of me, so at least for the larger sizes, I would only recommend if you have a small bust.  Otherwise, it feels well made and is lined; the quality is good for the regular price and great for the half off sale price."
2.0,Not Bad Not Good.
2.0,"Runs smaller than some of their other styles, wish it came in a larger size as I was looking for a roomy top with pockets"
2.0,Returned- was not as cute as in photo.
2.0,"I have similar pjs from a different brand that are very soft, but these are made with a somewhat scratchy material. I am not sure yet if I'll be able to wear them all night because my skin is so sensitive. I was hoping that they'd get softer after washing, but they didn't. Also, very oddly, the brand/main tag was cut out of these. I have no idea why it was like this, but I ussualy see that done at stores that buy overstocked items to resell. Last issue- these are *very* see through, which I wasn't expecting. I had light blue panties on to try these, and they showed very clearly."
2.0,Chain broke first time wearing it. The words show up in reverse on the wall
2.0,"Overall look was great BUT the magnetic clip isnt very secure. I tried them on within a gauge and they happen to come unhinged a few times. Tried them on lobes bare as well, same issue, weight is nice not too heavy nor too light. Felt nice being able to wear hoops tho, just wish the durability off the magnetic clip was a bit stronger."
2.0,I ordered an xl and it‚Äôs too tight I should have gotten an xxl
2.0,The sandals are cute but run about two sizes small. My son is a 6 1/2 and hit this size but not sure if I got a defective pair of sandals because they were very small.
2.0,Look cute but feel flimsy and very thin
2.0,Comes in a much smaller size than advertized .
2.0,"Good sweater, fits about 2 sizes small"
2.0,"cute, but they are cut very small"
2.0,This dress has as funny shape.  It billows out over the hips.  I have worn it only with a fly-away sweater hiding that flaw.  I would not buy another one.
2.0,Sadly they did not fit. But they were nicely made. (Size 3x/4x)
2.0,"Will make good shower shoes not as cushioney as they look, no cushion at all"
2.0,"Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. Very nice looking, seems well made--but way too stiff. He hated it, had to get a different one."
2.0,looks great fit right but its cheaper material you get what you pay for
2.0,add at least a size and a half...  even to Grocosy sizing chart.
2.0,"Arms of jacket are different color than body of jacket. Arms fit great length was just like picture but body of jacket was stiff boxy, had no flow to it did not fall like picture it was terrible. Too late to send back and will never wear it!"
2.0,"When I got caught in a rain storm, the red beads turned my white dress red üòë the metal clasp turned quickly"
2.0,Pretty much worthless after one wash.
2.0,Not the easiest to use.  Too complicated for kids to set the alarms.
2.0,"I like the look and feel of the wallet for the most part. However, after a period of less than a month of light use, the zipper on the outside pouch started separating, rendering the pocket useless."
2.0,"Very cute, however it does run a bit large, normally wear a medium a small would've been better."
2.0,Started to come apart at seams after few washed
2.0,"Picture #4 is the only picture that resembles the actual product, I don't know if I have a huge head or this is too freaking tight, my guess is that they wanted to save on fabric.<br />I wish there was some regulations on using editing software on pictures of textile products. The design includes the eye sockets so you can never use it matching your face anatomy without having to try to fold it and that is a pain in the butt."
2.0,This was so long of a belt and it had rhinestones at both ends so you couldn't cut the length without it not looking at finished.  I ordered for a black dress but you could see the tape behind the stones so I ended up not wearing it because standing next to me it looked like it wasn't finished in the front.
2.0,"The ring had a nice delicate design and appears to be silver, however the stones make wearing it a bit uncomfortable as it was scratch against my fingers around it."
2.0,Not for larger women
2.0,"It was a perfect and comfortable fit before I washed and dried it. The length is so short now that I'm uncomfortable in them, and SO many pills. Pretty disappointing. I've had Russell sweaters for years and this is the first time I've experienced them shrinking and pilling so bad. Waste of 40 dollars."
2.0,These are very thin and on the small side
2.0,The strap extender clasps are smaller than the clasps on my fanny pack. It doesn't work.
2.0,These are from China and had the &#34;Dollar Store Toy&#34; smell.  I opened the box when I first received them and left them open for 4-5 hours and I came downstairs to my whole house smelling like plastic.  I returned them (great service) as I didn't want my clothes smelling like dolllar store plastic smell. They looked to be decent quality and would have like to have used them.
2.0,If you‚Äôre under 6‚Äô this thing will fit more like a night gown...
2.0,NOT WHAT I WANTED
2.0,not solid silver.
2.0,"Very thin and flimsy, returned"
2.0,"The shirt was competitively priced and proved to be of expected quality; but it arrived 5 days after the promised date because the U.S. Postal Service delivered it to the wrong address.  Otherwise, this 2 Star rating would be a 5 Star rating."
2.0,"The jumpsuit material is very soft and cuddly, and the monkey applique was very cute, but the sizing is way off. The arms and legs are very long and the torso is small. I couldn't button up the top buttons because it was too tight across the chest. The snaps between the legs were awkward because the suit was so tight, and he couldn't keeps his hands out because the sleeves were too long. I hate it didn't fit right because it is a very cute jumpsuit.<br /><br />There was no tag with the size or washing directions. My grandson is exactly 1 day shy of 11 mos. and I ordered the 10 - 12 mo size. He is average size for his age.<br /><br />**I received this jumpsuit at a discount for my honest review, all opinions are my own**"
2.0,After washing these just a few times the stretchy part has become too stretched it seems and they look funny now. Not a good buy at all.
2.0,"I didn‚Äôt like, them they fall off."
2.0,"These are footless tights, not leggings!  Useless for what I wanted. Too sheer."
2.0,I'm not sure why this didn't fit. Was it becauseI have a short waist? While it was cute it just looked wrong on me and was a bit hard to get up over the backside! Looked well made and fabric was nice.
2.0,"I chose this rating because the picture on the site is deceiving.  I am shocked to see how tiny the charm is. Also, its very difficult to read the saying on it because of its size!<br />.<br />I will not be recommending this charm/zipper pull to others<br />."
2.0,Bar was not long enough. Very painful with such a short bar.
2.0,One of the zipper broke after first use. Strap adjustment slips so it will not stay at the correct length.
2.0,"Material was not as expected, not the best quality......."
2.0,"Cute shirt but way too large, I ordered my usual size. Have to return, one size down may even be too big"
2.0,This was enormous. Seemed like it was made for a large man with a beard. Sent it back and they refunded me so that was nice :)
2.0,I am 5'5 and 150 lbs. I ordered a large and it was very unflattering. The middle was too tight and the pant bottoms were baggy and awkward. Maybe it's just my body type but I was not impressed at all
2.0,Everything else is as described except the jersey looks silly because of how small the letters on the front are.
2.0,This dress isn't worth the price. I thought since it was more expensive it would be a nice material but its very cheap looking.
2.0,The cactus‚Äôs peeled off and the watch stained brown
2.0,it was broken when i got it so i returned it and it was larger than i had thought it would be
2.0,"Fabric is pretty thin, needs a slip or it is see through."
2.0,Color lighter than picture.  Fabric is not super comfy but it's not scratchy either.  The sleeve hem starts below the armpit which gives it a weird look.  Kinda boxy in the body but tight and a tad short in the arms.  I am 5'5 130lbs and ordered the small.  Length was below the belt an inch or two.
2.0,Hat was just to large.
2.0,"Well, I wanted to love this scarf, but it's so flimsy, it's like gauze. It pulls easily, and the design is printed on it not woven. That said, it was designed by Cher, so I'm keeping as a conversation piece. Honestly, though, save your money for something of better quality."
2.0,Fits extremely small and was too tight of fit for head. Returned
2.0,"I am thankful I postponed my review despite my excitement upon receiving these earrings.  The color is pleasing, the weight is perfect and the design detail is beautiful....here comes the sad but true portion; the post on one earring is mangled, the hole on the same piece will not hold the post as the hole seems to be drilled a bit too large.  Neither post will hold in that piece actually.  Long story short, I have one good faux gauge and one unusable.  :'[  I really wanted to believe the other reviews were wrong as I enjoyed wearing these the 1 time I was able.  Hopefully quality is addressed for future produced pieces."
2.0,The arms were to small and the rest was to big.  Love the feel but not a good fit.  I haven't opened the pink pair because it will be the same way.
2.0,I returned the product due to a very strong odor!!
2.0,"Cheap fabric , which I expected, but hoped it would be better in person. Sent back"
2.0,Dislike that it is not as Army green as the picture.<br />Like the fit.
2.0,I bought this on December 30th and as of yesterday March 31st - I used everyone of them due to them breaking one by one. The black rubber holder breaks too easily. The strap is good but obviously can't work without the back rubber holder. Thought this would help hold my glasses. Bummer
2.0,too small cute shape
2.0,Not very user friendly. Wasted space on the one side with small sewn sections
2.0,Dissapointed. The golden accent around the neck looks incredibly cheap. I am a size 8 and bought XXL and it is way too tight. Can't use it. Otherwise it looks nice. It's a shame
2.0,I didn't realize this was a tight womens shirt and I dont like tight fitting tees. I was hoping for an oversized fit or unisex fit. Cute design though.
2.0,wish the material was not so wrinkly and that the length was longer
2.0,"Cute design but the lenses are so light, hardly keeps the sun out of your eyes"
2.0,"If you buy this and it feels too small, don't think that you can just go up a size. It only comes in one size, the difference is the length of the shirt. I'm only giving it 2 stars because the yogi people are really cute other that that this shirt is way too tight and unflattering."
2.0,Very disappointed with the product to small
2.0,"This video would be a great workout if the combinations weren't so fast and complicated. I've been kickboxing for 2 years, and there is no chance I could follow this. I'm usually pretty stubborn, and have to finish what I start, but I got too frustrated with this video and actually quit half way through. I'm disappointed..."
2.0,THIN AND EXTRA LONG.  IT IS JUST OK.
2.0,Way too small. Looks like the product. Buy if you are slim built.
2.0,These are not the D shaped Ring as advertised.  They are more of a hook style.
2.0,"More like a kids size and slides off the head, but well made"
2.0,"The cleavage area is done for a B cup, not appropriate to the size I purchased which should have accomplished comfortably covering a D cup.<br />The color of the decor on this white suit  is also more grey in person than blue - I think the picture was just a little off on that"
2.0,"I tried it on my glasses, and it's not completely fogless; it doesn't work in all conditions."
2.0,Loved my ear vines but they broke after wearing just twice !
2.0,"Cute top but a size to big, size chart is off"
2.0,This was VERY boxy and weighted in the midsection.  Definitely a misleading picture.  Did not like.  Returned.
2.0,I love the dress. It is beautiful. Great quality! The Top color was not the exact color of the Navy blue in the design. I wanted to keep it but it would bother me. The color dye was faded navy blue and the skirt design was rich navy blue. A nautical look but too bad it did not match completely. It would of look like I wore a 2pc with two different shades of Navy rather than a whole dress with an even flow of the color. I will try another color because the material of the dress was heavy and sown well. It stretch nicely to move gracefully. I returned it. Thank you.
2.0,Had to return it. Not what thought. To short for acoustic guitar.
2.0,So so product.
2.0,Broke the second day.  You get what you pay for!!
2.0,It's more for a girl than a women. Lost quite a bit of weight recently went from a size L to a S but it gets pretty expensive replacing everything so I hoped these pack of S underwear would fit. I do suggest a size up maybe even two because they do not stretch. Couldn't wear them comfortably so I haven't washed them yet so I'm unsure if it shrinks after being washed.
2.0,I have contacted the seller regarding not receiving the color band that is listed in the description. I have not heard back yet. Hopefully I will because i love these bands just wish the colors described in the details was what I had received.
2.0,I tried this device on a Breitling Chronospace watch and regardless of how I tried it did not work. The instructions do state that it may not work on very tight case backs...
2.0,not my cup of tea.
2.0,The dress is shear and itchy where the embroider design is located.
2.0,"The idea of the suit was great (I really like the twist/bandeau design) but for an XXL, the top/chest area was so small I had to return it. The rest of the suit fit fine."
2.0,The material on this is very noisy and it would make me sweat in my sleep. It doesn't offer much elasticity which I think is needed for sleep attireü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI returned it.
2.0,These are waaaay too big. It says that they are unisex but I think the sizing is just for men. Giving them to my husband as these are too big for me to even velcro.
2.0,These are too tight in some areas and too baggy in others.
2.0,Dress did not look as portrayed online. This dress looked like it had been a returned item just stuffed in the bag. The dress did not fit and would not recommend purchasing this item as it looks cheap.
2.0,Very pretty blouse but the sitching on the sleeve became undone.
2.0,"I ordered my usual size medium. I'm 5'5"" 145 lbs. They were very short in the waist. I could never get them pulled up quite high enough and as soon as I walked, they slipped down and gave me a muffin top. The color was pretty. They are very light weight and the seams around the waist and hip area do not stretch."
2.0,"Pro's: Easy transaction, quick delivery considering it's overseas, package & content arrived undamaged, attractive price tag<br />Con's: Necklace appears visually cheap/generic<br />Overall: Good price, quick delivery, poor quality, not what I expected, I have yet to wear it."
2.0,Pens√© que eran m√°s frescas y se acomodaban diferente al cuerpo. Hay camisas m√°s baratas y de mejor calidad que estas.
2.0,"This was comfy, but it fit weird."
2.0,"Really thin and as soon as we washed it the first time the image had spots on it where it changed colors and we use bleach free laundry detergent for sensitive skin. Bad quality, and they‚Äôre trying to make me pay for shipping to send it back. Not to mention having to wait a month to receive it!!!! I do NOT recommend this seller."
2.0,THE BAD REVIEWS ARE RIGHT. Super cheap material. The fit was really weird. It flares at the waist but gets tighter at the bottom. Super not pleased.
2.0,The sticker part wasnt very good and it started falling pretty soon after I put then on. I wont be using/repurchasing them
2.0,"The material on these shirts are really nice and they don't have 'elastic' looking lines running through it like other shirts do; HOWEVER, this is probably why they are not really compression shirts.  My husband said the shirts were nice to wear for a lightweight hold but it doesn't really compress or hold anything from jiggling around.  Maybe if you bought it a size or two smaller?  I order an XL in both the Roc Bodywear and this but I'll be returning these and buying more of the Roc as he loves how they hold everything firmly (he has lost over 70 lbs so far)."
2.0,Is a good material but is to short in the middle area.<br />I‚Äôm tall and the boob section was in my ribs.<br /><br />For short ladies
2.0,"The dress I received was so cheaply made it that it wasn‚Äôt fit for anything more than a play costume dress. It barely resembled the dress pictured by the seller and looked like it would fall apart in an hours worth of wear. Don‚Äôt waste your money or time on this one. At least the return easy, that‚Äôs the only reason for the second star."
2.0,"Chain broke within a month. My daughter requested a locket with her brother‚Äôs picture in it for Christmas, as he joined the Air Force and moved away. This was a last minute selection, quickly made. Next time I will be more careful, as this was very cheaply made and the chain didn‚Äôt even last a month."
2.0,"These are very pretty, but both my mother and I had the same issue. It broke very easily and quick."
2.0,"My friend ordered this sweater and I loved how it fit so I ordered my own. My sweater is WAY longer than the one she received and the sleeves are short. Other than that, the quality is good and it‚Äôs super cute!"
2.0,These are way too big. I ordered the smallest size and they didn‚Äôt stay on my feet. Returned
2.0,Returned right away. Material get like a thick felt. Won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not durable but it did not feel durable. The color is a bright orange vs a camel leather look.
2.0,Had to return.  They didn't fit.
2.0,The gears do not touch.  Moving one does not move the others.  It would be a five star product if they fix this.
2.0,"These glasses are not great, cheap and not sure who would ever wear these? My son will keep them for a Jeffrey Dahmer Halloween costume this October."
2.0,Maybe a smaller one would look less fake. Too gaudy for me.
2.0,Expected gloves to offer some form of grip. These are very slippery. The welded palm area is not grippy and is a slick surface.
2.0,Had to return too small...Smaller than other brands in the same size
2.0,"Husband ended up returning it because it didn't seem to hold as much as he'd hoped. After putting a few cards in it and some cash, it wouldn't fold closed."
2.0,Ordered a small fits more like. Medium to large. It‚Äôs oversized and more brown then anything else was disappointed
2.0,"Ordered the same size as always, but the medium for like a small. Also not good for anyone who has C+ breasts, tight fit. Also the upper section (body) is not long like on the pictures, the elastic hits right under your breasts NOT at the waist."
2.0,button fell of the moment I tried this product on
2.0,The shoe is comfortable however I have only had them for 2 months and the outer material is crumbling apart. They are definitely not built for work in the kitchen.
2.0,Not as nice as I expected it to be but shipping was fast
2.0,"I wanted a light-weight summer dress. This one came with super long sleeves? Not really what I expected (or ordered), but whatever.<br /><br />The pattern IS pretty and vibrant, BUT the fabric feel is slightly rough/scratchy--not terrible, but not what I'm looking for in a comfortable summer dress. Finally, yes, it is see-through in the sense that, if you're out in the sun, people will see the silhouette of your legs, etc. If it was any thinner, I'd think it was a swimsuit cover. In fact, it probably would be perfect for a weekend at the beach/beachside/poolside/anywhere people would not be surprised to see the clear outlines of your lower body. Or I guess it could work with leggings and a tank, but again..I wanted a summer dress.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe I'll come back this winter and up it a few stars when I can actually wear it."
2.0,"I ordered a large and it was way too small, especially in the chest. Length and print were good. Material is see through and light."
2.0,"I do alot of climbing up and down and moving around. these underwear climb up my legs and must be constantly adjusted. I have never had boxers ride up so much that i had a wedgie until i wore these. If you sit on your butt all day long, they are probably fine."
2.0,"These 925 double plumeria earrings tarnish very fast! Was ok for about a month but after several wearings the entire petal which was white becomes a dark gray. Silver cleaning/polishing does very little to bring its luster back. It now remains dull gray even after a professional cleaning (which I also paid for).<br /><br />I have other 925 (sterling pieces) and while they do tarnish over time, its never this fast and this bad.<br /><br />I am disappointed.<br /><br />Happy to answer any other questions customers may have so they dont have the same experience as I."
2.0,It has to be worn alone and not with any other earrings.
2.0,Item broke 2nd day using it. I bought it for a costume so fixed it with super glue but if you‚Äôre buying to use daily I do not recommend.
2.0,Cute but such itchy material. Feels very cheep and expected more for paying this much.
2.0,Bought to cover my full sleeve for my job. I am 5&#34;2 & 130lbs. It has a very loose/too large of a wrist opening. Falls down because of the lack of tightness at the shoulder opening. Doesn't work to cover full arm throughout the day.
2.0,"I got this for my 16 year old daughter that is in love with dream catchers! She loved it! But, unfortunately after having it for a few weeks it broke. It‚Äôs not worth the price at all! She was very disappointed & so was I!"
2.0,"I like the logo but it was very oddly shaped in my opinion. What I mean by that is it was very short and too wide. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm super tall, not sure. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying it"
2.0,Very small; no way are these a normal men's sock size. Also kind of thin.
2.0,They fit as expected but unfortunately it has a hole in the right pant leg. I got these in the mail yesterday and put them on today. Disappointed.
2.0,I like the material and especially that they are cotton but unfortunately they have shrunk so much that they are now too small.
2.0,It runs small for thick long hair!! So disappointed
2.0,"Ordered a size larger than the Spanx leggings I currently own, and these are smaller! Different product than the pair I have, although titled exactly the same. Nowhere near as comfortable or soft. Disappointing."
2.0,"Sizing is waaaay off! I bought an extra large (regularly a large) so I can have wiggle room and it was super tight like a medium would fit me. The letter stuck together so when I opened the package I had to be careful not to remove the print screen. The idea is cute, but the quality and sizing of the t shirt was not worth keeping. I‚Äôm returning ASAP."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it's just not flattering on my body. I am thick on the bottom and skinny on top, this dress is just not for me."
2.0,The skirt is extremely short.  It‚Äôs have the size a diaper.  Not cool. It didn‚Äôt come with undergarments. Shorts or leggings is<br />A must. The color is very pretty. I will be returning
2.0,Picture looks great. Quality not so much. Was disappointed when I received. I haven't even worn 1 time and I've had for a long while now. Just another dust collector. I wouldn't recommend unless you just need it for one night to go with your attire and don't want to spend the money for good quality.
2.0,pretty but fell apart after wearing once
2.0,Overpriced.  Fabric stains easily.
2.0,Bigger than expected and material appears  cheap.
2.0,I didn't like that is way too big.
2.0,"I don't like this &#34;trucker&#34; style hat that sits very high above my head, and can only stay on by jamming it down over my ears.  I wear baseball caps all the time and for many years, and this is the most uncomfortable fit that I have ever had."
2.0,Worst fabric ever
2.0,"They are well made , but are a little small . But great to wear around the house ."
2.0,"Pretty but the posts were too big, didn‚Äôt fit through my ear!!"
2.0,Longer than I was hoping. Not very flattering
2.0,"If you read or find this review HELPFUL click that HELPFUL button<br /><br />If Jewelry is your looking might check the following if it is good for you<br /><br />1. Neck Size<br />Because of the design of this jewelry there will be a limited neck size. The neck size should be 13""-12"" in Circumference more than this would have less to no space between the jewelry and your neck, or someone using it.<br /><br />2. Design<br />Since the jewelry has 3 curves dangling down, its seems like it will be a problem when the wearer is moving to much because the jewelry will get tangled and there will effort in fixing it from time to time. the 2 chains can easily break if not cautious<br /><br />3. Quality<br />For my perspective, its like its cheaply made, like coated metal, the ones dangling, the details on it are not refined.<br /><br />Overall<br />if the person is someone who is not particular on the quality, and just used for times where there is less movement then this would be something you can consider to buy."
2.0,"I decided to purchase a larger size after reading the reviews. I went for this since several others said it was very long and lightweight.  I am 5'9 and about 200lbs, thick in the thigh and booty area. This 2x barely fit over my booty and was tight around that area and very big on the top. I was going to return it, but am going to give it to my sister to see if it fits her since we have different shapes but are both tall."
2.0,"I returned these glasses, due to the blurry lenses, I felt they were also pricy for the quality.  The frames were stiff."
2.0,"This short sleeve lace top is disappointing. It comes in bigger than expected/described based on their size chart. The length of this lace top is much longer than expected as well.  The material is very thin. It will require to have a cami underneath, otherwise it sees through."
2.0,"Based on other Amazon reviewers who said the tank ran really, really, really small in the chest. I ordered up to the XL hoping that it would be large enough for my 28 HH bust. I am 5'3&#34; and 120 pounds. My chest is 35 inches in diameter. This tank top is super, super, ridiculously, LONG! It comes about 1.5&#34; inches above my knee! It is almost a knee length night DRESS tank top on me!  I had my 6'4&#34; husband put it on and it was even too long  for his very, very, long torso and it was tight on his hips.  It only cost $5 bucks but shipping was $5. It would cost $5 to return it. So since I can't wear it and my husband cant wear it. I am going to take it to the thrift store. It isn't worth paying $5 to ship it back to get a $5 refund.  -  The quality is fine. The material is thin. It would be great for super hot and humid climates as 100% cotton breathes well. It is made well. Just beware of the fit.  ---Women's Basic Jersey Racer-Back tank top review."
2.0,Break easy don‚Äôt waste your money
2.0,Very flimsy. Broke second time I wore. Too bad cuz they're cute.
2.0,Rough fabric
2.0,"Might look good with a polyester leisure suit, but it's not for me."
2.0,"Not true to size, need an  XX-large."
2.0,One size does not fit all - Too small for my head - I wear a L hat. - returned item
2.0,I ordered this for a group costume. The accessories are great but the jacket is cheap. The first order had a snag and hole so I ordered a replacement. That process was super easy and replacement was quickly shipped. New order came today. Jacket again has snags. They aren‚Äôt as bad as the first jacket but still frustrating
2.0,The tongue stays flat most of the time. Not the old school style I was expecting.
2.0,Too tight and uncomfortable. Not possible put on child feet. Not recommend.
2.0,"Sleeves were too short. I would definitely recommend to size up 1 or 2 sizes. The material the dress is made from makes you sweat instantly...bleh...what else can I say? I liked the polka dots, which is why I give the dress a try, but knew as soon as I put it on that this Love was not meant to be..."
2.0,Super tight in the chest and shoulder area.
2.0,"Super soft and comfy. Pasted squat test, definitely not see through! I think I might rebuy these but the 2 time I worked out in the they got a hole :("
2.0,Mi hija le encantaron muy bien material y buen dise√±o
2.0,Too big. Not warm
2.0,The bottom fob fell off already .
2.0,I think the undergarments are absolutely adorable! However the size of the product is way off. The shirt did not even fit over my head! I should have known better when I saw one size. But I tried anyway. I would only buy this for a 14/16 or maybe 1/2. Would not buy the item for anyone any bigger.....
2.0,"Good design. Still hard to put on. On the right track but not there yet. They leaked!. Maybe its the shape of my childs eyes??? Or his nose, but they leaked water."
2.0,"I ordered the boat neck in purple. The material is soft and stretchy and the color is great. BUT, it looks nothing like the picture. The sleeves are not big and flowy and there is no rouching. It's like an oddly cut t-shirt that just gets narrow in the waist. Speaking if waist,  if you have a small waist and larger hips, this is not the shirt for you. It looks great on my sister who has a large chest and small waist and hips. If you fit that description, then this will work for you."
2.0,I like the flat waistband and cut in general but they arrived with a hole at the seam.
2.0,"There's a small heating element just over the, tops of the toes and that's it. And they don't put out much heat. The batteries are also very bulky and fall out all the time."
2.0,Discolored in days. Feels like plastic. Don‚Äôt buy it.
2.0,Very cheap fabric.Not happy with it.
2.0,Way too tight. Doesn‚Äôt stretch well and had hard time pulling it over my head. More like a child size. The material is thick and doesn‚Äôt breathe.
2.0,"It ran very, very small my husband wears XL I bought 3XL and it was still too small"
2.0,They come lose no matter how tight I screw them in.
2.0,"I would like to start off with the fact that this is a well made, beautiful dress. I received mine with a defective zipper however, which I understand can happen. I ordered 12/14/17. I am still awaiting approval of my refund.. It is 1/10/18. Will update once the matter has been taken care of."
2.0,Some of the holiday masks were made with the Santa or Christmas scene upside down with the nose piece at the chin. Would not order from them again.
2.0,Didn‚Äôt give the lift I was looking for. It actually made my breast look smaller. The quality was not great too.
2.0,Of course the &#34;925&#34; is intended to fool the gullible into thinking the core is sterling silver. It's questionable if the core is even a plated base metal. But what can one expect for under five bucks? My only objection was that some of the beads were scratched and looked used. Since sending them back actually cost more than the refund I just threw away the scratched/used looking ones which left me with 6 beads. The only silver lining is that they fit the Pandora I bought my daughter and will suffice until I get her some authentic charms in the future.
2.0,not tight enough.
2.0,These boots look like plastic and they are bulky. Did not work out for me. Sent them back.
2.0,Neck line is not at all what is pictured!<br />But the Material seems soft and comfy.
2.0,"I'm very dissapointed. Shoes look and feel very solid and nicely finished. Fit as expected. I bought size 8 for my son at the beginning of October but we leave in Nashville TN so it was too hot to wear them for a long time. At the beginning of November, after just a month and more importantly after just a first use the shoes are already worn up! I understand that 2 year old is running like a crazy but how those shoes supposed to survive the entire season (even very short)? The rubber on the bottom just got torn off which suggests that the quality (and density) was very poor. You can't tell this when you take the shoes out of the box. Layers disattached and the cover has scratches. Despite the company has many good looking shoes I will not order from this Seller anymore. Thankfully Amazon was supportive to take my return after a month passed, otherwise I would waste a lot of money for trash! I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. I gave two stars because they really look good..."
2.0,The glasses definitely helps but I did not receive the correct color frame
2.0,Didn't fit well on my ear.
2.0,"Cute design, but the image on amazon clearly has stones and the actual product does not."
2.0,"Wish it was a bit better quality material, otherwise a fair price"
2.0,You need an undershirt with this
2.0,Not as faded as picture shown! (the picture with Desi Perkins is actually her brand of sunglasses with another company)<br />Also my glasses came in a flat white large plastic envelope with nothing protecting the glasses from being squashed/smashed during shipping process!<br />They feel lightweight and cheap (as they are)<br />Save your dollars and buy the real deal people!!
2.0,"As much as I love these I have to give it a 2 star... The part that rests in the inside of your mouth has a rough edge so it hurts a lot. Smiling hurts, pouting hurts, every expression and even talking hurts.. Had to go spend more money at hot topic for just 2 bioflex labrets..."
2.0,The band is OK but the materials so scratchy it‚Äôs like wearing a sandpaper bracelet.
2.0,"I do not like These at all. The metal is very stretchy.. but they're too much like leggings.  Not like workout pants. If you enjoy showing off your camel toe for the whole world to see, then look no further, here's the workout pants you have been dreaming of. Holy moly.. I couldn't believe how much these were outlining my vag.. I will be returning these. Way too embarrassing to wear out in public. Yikes.. also the color doesn't look like the pictures."
2.0,"My 98 yr. old mother needs the slip resistance on the socks to help guard from slipping and falling.  These socks looked perfect but didn't hold up to more than 3 washings before the rubbery material lost its resistance.<br />I also was concerned as they fit well at the beginning of the day but as her feet swelled throughout the day, they became way too tight on her."
2.0,"These were the right color, but a little small. The crotch area hangs down way too low. Glad it came with two sets for the price because our daughter got a big hole in them the first time wearing them to her ballet class just from normal dancing which has not happened to us the first time out in other tights. Would not buy again."
2.0,Gargles leak with water; snap that hold strap in place broke; gargles fog up. Very dissatisfied especially for the amount that was paid.
2.0,"I ordered up a size and although the dress fit because it was stretchy, it was just not as comfortable as I would like in a summer dress. It was a little snug around the chest and a bit too body conscious all the way down through the hip area. I was hoping for something I could be free and breezy in, while still looking somewhat put-together and this was just not it. By the way, if you get one that doesn't have the raw seaming details, it is probably inside out from someone returning it. The dress does go either way/reversible -- if you'd rather have smooth seams on the outside."
2.0,I really wanted to love this off the shoulder dress.  It was OK.  I wasn't a fan of the color.  I felt like I was headed to a Green Toga party.  The material feels like a sheet and I felt like I was wearing a potato sack - not flattering at all.  Its a little more flattering if you wear the belt with it.  The elastic around the shoulders is very snug but if you wear it half shoulder it doesn't feel so tight.  It just didn't do it for me.  Its cute when you look at it but  not so much when its on.
2.0,I ordered a black dress in a size large and they sent me a olive green one the style is beautiful I love it I ordered a size large which is quite big for me this dress runs extremely big a medium would have fit me much better keep in mind I'm 5-10
2.0,"The inside cushion pad is not attached to the shoe and it constantly moves during wear.  I would not recommend unless you are willing to fix this issue yourself.  The pad on the inside crumples up to the tip of the toe making it extremely uncomfortable.  I would only give it 1 star, except I didn't hate the fit but disappointed with the cushion slipping."
2.0,SheIn runs way too small.
2.0,"It arrived on time and was  cute, however I ordered an infinity scarf but received a small head scarf instead. It is too small to make a good &#34;wrap around neck scarf&#34; like an infinity scarf would have. I gave it as a Birthday gift and it was embarrassing."
2.0,"These belly rings really are pretty, and you get a great deal with multiple pieces for one price. With that said, I guess now I know I have some kind of metal allergy. The ring caused me to have a horrible skin reaction after only a few days of wear. I've had my navel pierced for over 15 years and haven't had anything like this happen before. I had to keep a ring out for a few weeks and have now switched to titanium without further issue. If you don't have a metal allergy, these really are cute! I did not find the plastic retainer bars to be very useful, as they are a bit short and the band that should lock them in place doesn't stay on very well. If you have a metal allergy, you should avoid these rings!"
2.0,The material was inferior.  The pocket was ripped on arrival.  In a short time both armpits ripped.  The material just seemed to just pull apart.
2.0,"They fit on my face well and the lenses were great, but the part that goes over your ears is just like two wires - they're very thin and flimsy which I didn't like."
2.0,Super cute. But beware of the sharp edges. Sheesh!
2.0,Sizes are WAAYYY smaller than listed. I recommend going at least a full size or two up.
2.0,Much smaller than the actual american waist size. Even for a man from Waco.
2.0,"It took 2 months longer than the expected shipping date, and the belt was not in the package. The skirt is also uncomfortably long."
2.0,I find it is still difficult to use.
2.0,These are made real cheep. The won't last long. Wear through real quick 2 weeks av.
2.0,Cheaply made boots came apart after 2 weeks my daughter only wore them 4 times
2.0,Way to small even for my below average sized head. Also the hat was too hard...
2.0,Too small in the hips; too large in the shoulders.  Looks like it's been cut from a men's pattern and the buttons have been reversed for women.
2.0,I loved this bra but that back clasp was too weird. Sent it back :( searching for one exactly the same with normal clasp
2.0,I order the wallet as a Christmas gift. I never received it. Seller apologize for the inconvenience that i appreciate but it took over 2 weeks and the seller was not able to resend another wallet.
2.0,"I bought this to use as a work bag, and I work 3 days a week.  I have had the bag for 2 weeks and the handle is almost completely ripped off.  I Ann very unhappy because the bag is nice and sturdy like I wanted, but unfortunately I won't be able to use it much longer."
2.0,I love these but noticed they were facing the wrong way . I requested a replacement and had to swap them out .
2.0,Design and style is nice but the material is synthetic to the point of feeling like plastic for a net of lemons. Returned it.
2.0,The color was not what it looked like in the picture. The red looked muted in the picture but was much brighter.  I liked the fabric and style but returned because of the color. Will reorder in a different color.
2.0,While these sunglasses were a great price I was highly disappointed in the quality and construction of them. They are very cheaply made. I would not recommend buying. I will be returning.
2.0,Cute but the top fits extremely tight and cut too far forward on the arms.
2.0,"I loved it, took awhile to get here, several months ...but the company was great...however it only worked for one night...the mask itself is good! Just no lights now...really wanted it for my classroom and students to cheer them up....I have let them know it stopped working within 24hours, a little miffed the automated message on Amazon said no longer edible to return...I just got it three days ago!<br />Sigh...Update, the replacement one arrived today in less than 10 days! The company was very nice, and quick to fix the problem!  I get to surprise my students tomorrow! So happy with this mask, and the seller! Thank you"
2.0,It is really pretty but as soon as I put it on one of them broke instantly.  I was sad because I like them and knew they would look beautiful with what I was wearing. I have a second pair (different design) hoping they hold up better
2.0,"I ordered them in my size, but they were really tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,"I did't like it, it look very cheap and the logo is in the from is very annoying and toy need to click the button on the left to see the time every time"
2.0,"It was really cute but much more ""crop top"" like than I had hoped."
2.0,Great concept but quality is not good. Zippers started coming apart very early and now the whole front ripped off during a flight. I lost a few items because of this.
2.0,They fit large and they have a chemical smell that did not come out after washing
2.0,The fabric shine has alot of glitter like particles in it. Tried even hand washing and still alot. Gets everywhere
2.0,"Cheap, sheer see through quality, looks NOTHING like the pic! Also, be realistic... if you do not have a small &quot;model&quot; type frame, it will look nothing like it does on the model! These models are probably about a size 4, with a tiny waist! I will shop physically, where I can try my clothes on from now on, as women's clothing is so different from men's standard fits. We all come in so many different shapes and sizes, but they expect us to all be petite model type figures!!"
2.0,Didn't care for this style. It was snug as are most Wacoal bras.<br />This style gave me a somewhat &#34; pointy&#34; look.
2.0,It fits well except for the chest area.  I am a 40D and size 14.
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for! It looks very cheap, the sparkle is way to artificial. Defenitely made in China!!"
2.0,"If you want to look like a lampshade, then this is the top for you! The color is beautiful, and the shirt is well made, it's just not attractive or comfortable to wear. The off-the-should top is great if you plan to stand perfectly still the whole time you're wearing it. The minute you move your arms the top shifts and becomes uncomfortable. The ruffle look is pretty, but the two tiered look resembles a lampshade and makes you look 8 months pregnant, no matter how tiny you may be. This one went straight into the Goodwill bag."
2.0,Way too big and not adjustable enough to not be too big
2.0,The sizing was wrong.  I ordered two sizes bigger and they were still a little small .
2.0,No es de plata es mentira lo que describe el el vendedor
2.0,Did not fit like I had hoped. Doesn't have any shape to it. Nothing like what the picture showed. Maybe if I ordered a smaller size it would fit better.
2.0,"Arch were to high, for me personally. Sole where to thick and chunky."
2.0,Today was the first time I wore this dress and if I wasn‚Äôt outside of the return window I would return it.<br />The dress is comfortable and flattering but I‚Äôm upset about the design.<br />The design is clearly printed poorly. Upon wearing it I found a few places that the pattern was printed over a string or a piece of wood or a cut of fabric that got stuck on top. Because when you pick those tiny things off the fabric is white/blank.
2.0,"Beautiful color and fabric, stretchy and comfortable, BUT the pockets billow out at the hips, ruining the line of the body. It makes you look like you have big hips. I had to remove the pockets and sew the openings shut to get a smooth look. Those pockets really ruin the style"
2.0,I don't like my Gomust Adjustable Breathable Sports Face Mask. It's too hard to breath through when you're exercising.
2.0,These run about a size large .
2.0,Soft feeling but runs small. I even ordered a size large than usual
2.0,"I've been trying to return this item for weeks (too big) and exchange it for a smaller size, but can't seem to get a response from the company. I realize they were closed for 2 weeks, but that's been over a week ago now. I've had this type of Nike watch before and liked it.I'd like to get the replacement watch before I leave on vacation in a couple of weeks, and am getting a little frustrated!"
2.0,The material was rough and stiff and the fit was too small.
2.0,Love the size but it change color after a few wears.
2.0,The charm itself is really nice however the chain broke less than 24 hours of wearing it
2.0,The shirt was very tight and super stiff.  It's pretty cute but it just didn't fit well enough to keep it.
2.0,"Looked for about a week, then the rose gold flaked off. Not very good quality."
2.0,"I liked these while they stayed on my shoes, which were probably about 5 uses. I wish they were more durable overall."
2.0,"Attractive BUT, frame broke on 2 pr. w/o being dropped very quickly.  One frame broke while being worn.  In darker shade color rubs off on bridge of nose.  Haven't even pulled out other 2 PR. Not sure why I gave them 2 stars!"
2.0,"Well, this one lasted 5 months before the latch broke and I had to use a rubberband to keep it shut. I would like to at least get a year out of one of these to at least feel like I got my moneys worth."
2.0,I have a few Fensace dresses. This one was a let down. The fabric was thin and the thread at the seams are visible. Decided to keep it but it's a one time wear. Save your money. Cheap looking.
2.0,The straps that hook to the bag started to tear after one week of use.  I had to return the product.  Otherwise I loved all the pieces.
2.0,"I bought these to wear under t-shirts because I sweat a lot. I bought the three pack white ones. I did follow the size chart. They are tighter but that works for me because I want them under a t-shirt. However, I wore them today for the first time. It has been riding up. I have had to keep pulling it down. Not sure I will wear them anymore. I bought black ones from another brand and LOVE them. Link for them is below:<br /><br />https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B074WPHJYK?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details"
2.0,My son loves these slippers but they are way too big for him I ordered 1/2 to 2years and he's 4 and still big. I ordered the smallest size they had
2.0,Runs very small in arm holes as well as chest.
2.0,The big red stone in the middle is not the same as shown in the picture and that spoils the look of the earring.
2.0,I ordered this shirt as a birthday gift and the listing shows a pink/purple outline of the letters but instead received the standard orange/yellow flame logo - fits fine just very annoyed that they have the wrong picture listed from the description.
2.0,"Wish I would have tried this on sooner, I bought it for a birthday party, wow that material is not breathable at all. I live somewhere it's hot from may-October and theres no way I could wear this thing during summer. Also, I got an XL and I'm only a 36A and this was tightest around my chest. Smashing my chest down. Definitely size up especially if you're busty or just dont buy because the material is so wretched. Literally, if I would have tried to return this 3 days ago I could have. And it comes from China FYI for everyone."
2.0,"I bought an XL. I am only 5'5"" and these were too short. Definitely size up. They're cute but a little rough, like a towel. Look nice though."
2.0,"These tops roll up, I guess it‚Äôs the material."
2.0,"Sooooo cute, but entirely too small!"
2.0,mask has large gaps at the top and side that would make it pretty much useless for whats going on in the pandemic...however the seller did not str8 up say it was good for the pandemic....i think it is misleading to post it along with the other masks....the gauze filters that came with it certainly are not gonna stop anything!  we are wearing masks in public to prevent the spread...(possibly GIVING IT UNKNOWINGLY TO others....the large gaps in the fit may be detrimental to that...but the seller did what they said they would do
2.0,While it fit as expected it was like it wasn‚Äôt finished being made. It‚Äôs very lightweight. The top two zippers are not pockets just decoration. I‚Äôm a seamstress so I lined it and made the top two zippers into pockets. I gave it to my daughter and it‚Äôs super cute.
2.0,I was replacing some sweeps..let's say unimpressed. .these's are about1/8 th smaller than the Oakley lenses. .so lots of light into your eyes..and a lot left uncover..
2.0,I love the style but it started to turn brassy after the second time i wore it.
2.0,We but a lot of my daughter's clothing through Amazon and this dress looks nothing like advertised. The material is stiff and will need to be ironed constantly.
2.0,"Not what I expected. Just a T-shirt. Low quality, fits smaller"
2.0,We had to sew the straps down in the back so that the front actually covered her private chest area.  So tired of products made this way.
2.0,I love these pants but am very disappointed in the stitching. Was informed that the crotch had started coming undone while I was wearing them! I have tried to fix them myself but it must be the material because they keep coming un-stitched
2.0,THIS IS A MONEY CLIP
2.0,"This cut was not as I expected and the fabric is super heavy, although not 100% opaque either. It is tight in the shoulders, and the fabric doesn't feel good to the touch. I expected it to be lightweight and flowy, but it's quite the opposite. Had to return."
2.0,"It was a gift for my grandson, just out of the Army. He is now going to AzSU."
2.0,Love this band but... came apart this first time use. Husband had to glue the band back in the metal clasp and crimp it down.<br />Material is soft and adjustable fit is nice
2.0,I haven‚Äôt worn the socks but I like how they feel and are super cute bbbuuutttt they are mismatched.
2.0,Tight through bust
2.0,Very difficult to put on shoes. Not worth it
2.0,Not suitable if you have hardwood floors. No grip.
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like the feel of the material‚Ä¶ End it was too small
2.0,i have yet to figure out how to get this to sit on my ear without bending it to a breaking point since that grabby part at the bottom near the tail is at a completely wrong angle for the dragon arms up top to grab the ear.
2.0,Scratchy fabric and smaller than expected.
2.0,very tight fit
2.0,These might fit a 5 year old but definitely not an adult.  They also Don't keep your head cool.  Total waste of money!
2.0,Never got to actually use these since there is no great way to get them on. They don't squish easily and the backs don't come off.
2.0,"I had to look up the symbol for cotton in Chinese to figure that the tag says these are 95% cotton. They don't breath as well as regular cotton undies, perhaps better than a plastic bag."
2.0,Look cheap material look dull could have got a dress like that at Ross Dept store for 20 or less
2.0,"I was a bit disappointed in sizing. The top fits great but the bottoms are too small. I would have to buy another swimsuit in medium to be able to have each piece fit. It is a cute swimsuit, just wish the sizing were more proportionate."
2.0,"OK, not thrilled...looks like something from wish.  Sized even smaller than that...sad. printed the same as other stuff I got from there but cost...way higher."
2.0,"Although the chain is really lovely, it keeps catching onto my short hair.  It's really annoying, plus it hurts."
2.0,"I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù, size 10-12, I ordered a medium and it was too short! NOT tall girl friendly!"
2.0,"Based off reviews, I decided to go with an XXL even though I normally wear a L. (5'7"" / 185lbs / curvy) It comes to mid-thigh so it's long, its too baggy from the waist down, and then the sleeves are too short. It's just not the right fit for my body. It's not as streamline of a fit as is shown in the model photo, and because it's poochy in the waist and butt it's the opposite of flattering. Stitching at intersections of pockets are weird and those will probably fall apart. And the color sleeve color is more washed out than represented in the photo ‚Äî not bad, just not a rich/dark wine color. It is comfy though, so I'm keeping it and I'll plan to wear it at home only (much to my husband's dismay). I might have to DIY it to be a totally different style ‚Äî we'll see."
2.0,Not real.  Neck did not hold its shape.
2.0,"No elasticity at all, and not true to size."
2.0,I got this product for a Yandere Chan cosplay. It was nice but it was way too small and I had to keep readjusting it on my head.  It was very uncomfortable.
2.0,works for rain
2.0,"If you like it when color of your shirt bleeds on to everything it touches, then this is the one for you. Don‚Äôt worry though, you won‚Äôt notice this until AFTER you wash it. It‚Äôs a really good thing it smells like cancer inducing chemicals, which is why I threw it in the wash immediately. As I was taking my clothes out I noticed it was leaving red splotches on everything it touched. Thankfully somehow it didn‚Äôt ruin my entire load. I‚Äôm glad it was easy to return at Kohl‚Äôs. And hey, at least you‚Äôre going to get a $5 gift card when you return it."
2.0,its very small and can't read the countries....not very happy with the product.
2.0,I have had these for 3 weeks and they are faded and stretched out and I am gonna donate them.  Very disappointed in the quality.  Will not recommend or buy again.
2.0,very long and narrow and the straps are long too. I have to stretch it out to wear it. I am a size 10 pant I bought a large. a $3.00 undershirt!<br />Don't waste your hard earned money on this top:(
2.0,"PJ‚Äôs were soft, a little snug, but a deal breaker because they are line dry only!"
2.0,I got it in the mail and it was lit up. I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a pull tab or what but mine didn't have one. I've only had it on me for a day in my bag and it already seems dim. Going to contact customer service because maybe I got a dud? It's the perfect size and shape to fit in my inner clear ID pocket so I was hoping it would last a while since it's led. It didn't really come on automatically in the bag - you have to shake it a little
2.0,"arrived broken,maybe with a good super glue they will be fine, at the end they are not bad, they are cute."
2.0,"I bought this to use for taking my computer for work back and forth.  I'm a professional so I needed something nice looking.  I thought this was it.  However, this bag is thin, dull and cheap looking.  It also smells like chemicals (formaldehyde???).  I'd pass on this one unless you just need a satchel to use around town.  I'll likely return it.  I put leather in quotes since I  am not sure whether it is.  It probably is but it's a cheap type."
2.0,"Out of the six socks in this package, within 2 weeks, 3 of them have major holes. All seem to be along seam lines and in unraveling yarn on interior of sock. Very poor workmanship. Even at this price, not a good buy."
2.0,"I received them fast. They look the same as in the picture shown. The material will shred your skin though!  Trying to slide then up my legs was painful enough....but getting them off was miserable as wel . There is no inner lining, so they are not comfortable to wear either. They are made cheaply, but if you are in a rut then these will wor . I don't have much of a tooshy and I'm usually a size 25/0-2 in most pants.. I'm and XS to a small in panties from VS and I ordered the mediu . They look big in the package but since there is no stretch to the material, they barely fit me.  I'd definitely order a size up for sure!  Some of the sequins fell off with me trying them on.  I never wore them and out them back in the package and I'm actually pretty tough. Ouch!"
2.0,"The watch is beautiful, I couldn‚Äôt wait to put it on until I noticed the little diamond that‚Äôs supposed to be where the 12 is was broken off and inside of the watch. It‚Äôs moves around in there and stops the second hand from moving. So now I have to send it back and wait for a new one in hopes this one isn‚Äôt broken."
2.0,"While this is a really cute and comfortable band, it stretches out so fast."
2.0,Nice craftmenship. The problem...it is easy to bump the release latch and lose the bracelet. That happened to me after having it just three weeks.
2.0,"I loved the photo and when I first opened it looked great. The material was a little thinner than I was expecting for a military shirt and first washing faded the color a little.  There was what I thought was a slight shipping odor when opened but the odor remained even after laundry.  Not worth the hassle of returning it, we just donated it."
2.0,Muy apretado de busto las mangas anchas muy largo
2.0,"They are small like child sunglasses, not great quality at all and arrived in a huge box."
2.0,"These were not what I was expecting. They have actual rubber bands, I was hoping for the ones with the fabric bands that are more comfortable.  Out of the 20 only 12 worked."
2.0,Belt is stretchy. Weird quality to have in something that's supposed to hold your pants up.
2.0,"To tight on waist, not for muscley people."
2.0,"I had purchased this dress in another color (floral 02). I was so impressed I ordered the floral 07 style. Unfortunately it came in a little too large and the quality of the dress was not the same. It was dull, floppy, and just akward looking. The dress was even made in a different material. I was so disappointed since the 1st dress was a hit!"
2.0,"Was looking for just a lightweight robe, listed as cotton blend, but actually polyester  for the most part. I am 6 foot and 185 lbs, ordered Xtra large, found it to be tight, waist belt up way to high, when you sit down it rides up into your groin area. Not a comfortable fit, and clingy fabric."
2.0,The model showed the dress in a different color than I received.  I don‚Äôt like this baby blue.  I was expecting a greenish blue.
2.0,It looks cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"The bridge of the nose is unbeareable after 10 min. The weight is very heavy and the string makes things worse for it digging into my face. I replaced the string with eleastic shoes laces and it was better, but could only wear it for pictures."
2.0,"Check the size,  I couldnt even get them on.  I returned them"
2.0,Was more peach than pink. Sending it back.
2.0,"I wear reading and driving glasses, but the glasses (plural) that I bought from you are used for fine print on whatever.  Which comes to plural.  I thought I was buying two pair of glasses.  Your advertisement on online is misleading.  It showed two pair of glasses therefore I thought I was buying two pair.  Go Figure.  I also wanted 6.0 not 5.0.  Anyway, I didn't get what I thought I was getting.  I guess I should read the fine print next time, huh?"
2.0,The dress is self was fine. I'm 6'1&#34; so it was just to short. It came to about t-length
2.0,"The feel and the weight of the socks do not feel as 100% cashmere but more a combination of wool and cashmere. Socks made with 100% cashmere are very light, flexible and soft which is not the case with these socks."
2.0,The index finger is manufactured crooked. But for the cost you can try it and find out yourself.<br />We all know that China is struggling to produce quality items to the U.S. This is another example of a poor product. I don't know if they will ever get it right but I have hope. I wouldn't waste my time with this product.
2.0,This ring was a gift for my wife. After wearing it my wife's finger turned green underneath this ring !!!!! Never had 14K Gold do that before; A fake ?
2.0,"Ordered these few days ago.<br /><br />Over all good shades, however after changing a few lenses, I realized that not all lenses are nice and snug fit. Especially the polarized dark ones which are not a good fit and stay loose. Not sure if it is an over all problem or  it may be just the pair I received that doesn't fit all to well.<br /><br />Will be returning!"
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for. Toddler wore them indoors only for a couple of weeks and they are beat up already.
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but could be made with better quality. Sizes run small, I would order 1 size or 2 up."
2.0,"it was too big, don't like the material it is made of and a see through"
2.0,I never opened the bag that the dress came in as I could clearly see loose stitching all along the neckline and shoulders.  Returning.
2.0,and the key is kinda small. The chain is adjustable which is nice but it should be a little heavier for the weight it has on it.
2.0,"The wallet seemed like a good purchase at the time but now I am not so sure. Within a week the leather strap with the bead on it broke/ unravelled and I could not fix it because I pulled it out of my pocket and half of it was gone. The inside of the wallet is fairly spacious, I fit some cash, 3-5 gift cards, my I.D., And my card all in it pretty snugly. However, there is no great way to store cash in here if you wanted to do do not get it for that purpose, the cash will get caught in the zipper very easily, the texter of the wallet is pretty good, it feels like more of a cloth type than leather. The inside is separated by a thin barrier made if the same cloth as the inside and is about half as tall. Overall, it's a pretty good wallet, the zipper zips well and it is easy to take in and out of pockets, rating a two star because the bea/ leather strip fell off and I mainly gravitated toward this wallet because of that. (There is a lot of room left inside the wallet in the photos)"
2.0,Don't use this if you have glasses; they'll just fog up.
2.0,Not very good quality and runs very small
2.0,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good for women with smaller breasts, but I have 38DDD‚Äôs. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the hell I was thinking when I ordered this, I guess prayed that it would work. I can tell though by just trying it on, that it could have if I was less endowed."
2.0,I liked this a lot but the sizing was all wrong.  I normally wear a large and ordered a large.  It is way too small.  I'm just going to give it to my 9 year old to wear.  And it's not sweatshirt material at all.  I would say its a nylon knit...but definitely not thick like a sweatshirt.
2.0,Still squinting. Very little sun protection.
2.0,"The gloves look nice enough, but even though they‚Äôre the size I always wear I can barely get the gloves on. They‚Äôre extremely tight, yet still 3/4‚Äù or more too long in the fingers. Very disappointing, and I‚Äôd recommend avoiding."
2.0,"Better than some other fitness brands on here, it's still pretty thin and runs small.  I usually wear a L or XL from UA and JS and the XL here was definitely too small on me.  Sad for its a great design."
2.0,This is not a PLUS sized fit.
2.0,Guage size listed as 16 guage 1.2mm... soon recieving these I measured them with my micrometer and found them to measure significantly smaller (0.95mm) not a 16 guage at all but were closer to a 18 guage or even 19 guage.<br />Other than that these are decent quality.
2.0,"Can't breathe when wearing, fogs glasses"
2.0,"Size was not smaller than indicated, if anything larger.  fingers were extra long as well. leather quality was 2-3 out of 5."
2.0,Looks like a great quality- but the sizing is very questionable. Too small.
2.0,"Sweater is super soft seems to fit true to size but the waist band doesn‚Äôt have have much give as I expected. However, the sweater I received was balled up in a bag. When I took it out it was covered in pet hair!!! I was definitely sent one that had been returned... that‚Äôs the reason behind 2 stars."
2.0,Honestly it looks too cheap in person. I really wanted to like it.
2.0,It‚Äôs looks just like description with the exception that it is huge! Seems to be more for plus size instead of one size. I could get two more arms in the sleeve. It doesn‚Äôt come to the ankle like pictured but that tolerable it‚Äôs just too big for a one size.
2.0,"Cute keychains, but they both broke (I bought two of them for my sons) within 2 weeks of use."
2.0,Much smaller than i expected. Ended up getting one at Wal Mart that held more.
2.0,"Both of the bands did not fit the device well. It is extremely loose, which makes the vibration notifications annoyingly loud. I got the proper ones from Datel, and I am much happier with those."
2.0,"The gloves I received were way lighter than the ones in the pic. The gloves in the pic also appear to be made of a heavier suede. The ones I got are light in color and light in weight. I was disappointed because I am looking for leather gloves with a real shearling lining. I also bought the YISEVEN Women's Merino Rugged Lambskin Shearling Leather Gloves, which I will be keeping and returning these."
2.0,Size is off.
2.0,"I ordered these but when I received them they were a gold tone instead of silver. The style is nice, but I was disappointed. Admittedly I did not bother contacting the company to inform them of the error. I have worn them a few times. They are very thin lightweight and they have not turned my fingers greens which sometimes happens with inexpensive accessories. If the rings were silver like I ordered I would have given more stars."
2.0,"Really tiny through the back, though the reviews suggested I could order the size I usually do.  I would probably have to order 2 sizes up and then it would be too big in the front.  Passed it on to a friend with slimmer shoulders."
2.0,"En general es bonita pero demasiado grande para mi cara, no hay manera que se quede ajustado a mi cara as√≠ que no la puedo usar."
2.0,I ordered the biggest size available. I wish it was just one size bigger then it would have been perfect. I really loved the bathing suit too.
2.0,"The material becomes see-through when wet, not exactly ideal for swimwear. The top also runs large"
2.0,"Both of my good watches (one 37 years old and the other about 5 years old) died around the same time despite recent repairs.  I wanted a cheap watch fast while I think about getting another good watch.  The local drugstores no longer carry Timex or other watches so I went online and found this one.  On the plus side, it is the same color as the web site, is inexpensive, and it appears to run.  (I have had it too short a time to see if it is accurate.) On the down side, I was expecting something small and feminine, but the clock face is the size of a traditional man's watch.  The leather strap is wide, thick, and feels like plastic. My advice is too check the measurements of any watch you buy, because you can't tell from the picture.  i will keep this to use for  now, but I don't really like it."
2.0,"My band disconnected partially from the fastener in less than 2 months. I am not rough on my watch. This is poor quality. Would not recommend to a friend. It is also difficult to fasten, you need to use your thumb to push the peg through the hole."
2.0,Purchased 1/26/21.  Theynate ripping along my inner thigh...
2.0,Too small to know its earth
2.0,I purchased for the waterproof feature essentially to be able to handle wet material. For instance moving garbage cans in the morning soaked with dew. Hands instantly get wet with cold water. Terrible for winter gloves if your hands can get wet in the cold.  Stitching failed second time worn.
2.0,"- fit was terrible, the proportions were off<br />- dress was too short (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 for reference)<br />- material felt/looked like a costume"
2.0,It is very pretty thus why it received 2 stars.  I have worn it once and likely won't wear it again. It keeps falling apart where the rings are beside the charm and the magnets are not strong enough to hold if you move.  Not worth the hassle of sending it back.
2.0,These were pretty but looked cheap.
2.0,"Arrived damaged... Pulled out of the package with a huge snag right on the butt section ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I can't even try to work with it , it's too noticeable . Too bad... wanted these. Will be returning"
2.0,"The fit was nice but within 10 seconds of me putting this on, the pom poms were coming off. They were almost completely gone after a few hours. The sweater smelled terribly as well. Would not recommend."
2.0,No playing in the snow in these pants.  They were cut much to tight through the crotch and much wide through the lower legs.
2.0,"Very disappointing.  Smaller than in picture, doesn't shine or twinkle.  This was supposed to be a gift, but will be returning."
2.0,"Unfortunately, the material is quite cheap."
2.0,I like the netting but the garment is cut too short. It is also a lot darker than it appears in the picture which wasn't a deal breaker but the short length was. I returned this item.
2.0,"These were great for the first time, maybe 2. Now they constantly slip down off my foot so I have to throw them away.  Not worth the money"
2.0,"I gave this jacket 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is warm and fits well. My issue is I purchased this jacket for my son for Christmas and withing 90 days, every single zipper pull has fallen off and the zipper itself has broken off. The jacket is warm and my son really likes it, but a jacket isn't worth it's salt if it can't zip up."
2.0,Too teeny tiny
2.0,It only holds really small stones and doesn't expand much at all. Really disappointed..
2.0,"This top was to tight for a size Large. Pretty, but I didn't love rhe material either."
2.0,"I bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter. She's 5' 1&#34; tall and weighs 106 lbs. this was way too big. The straps sagged.  It was very cheaply made.  It hit her right at the knee. It fit very loosely. My granddaughter picked it out and she was very disappointed.  She won't be wearing it for Halloween.  I'd return it but, I can't print out a return label."
2.0,I am 5 foot and about 135lbs I bought a Large... super small
2.0,The fabric for this dress is extremely thin...I had to return it as you can see a full bra outline due to the sheerness of the top ;(
2.0,"I received a size 2X, but know I did not order that size. I usually am a medium or large. They fit large on me, obviously because of the wrong sizing. But after putting them on I think the best size for me would have been a large and I am 160 pounds. They are long enough for me and I am 5' 8 1/2"" tall. The quality really is not there. These are pretty thin and not thick material like the pictures allude to. Even though they were big, I wore them to run errands and was okay with the baggy look, but they are so thin that I was able to feel the chill of the cold weather. Luckily it wasn't too cold of a day. Also the drawstring isnt thick enough. I have to pull real tight to feel like it's doing anything. It's as thin as a shoe string."
2.0,"I purchased these gloves to wear while folding flags at military funerals at the advice of my Chief Petty Officer. The rubber dots are excellent for ensuring a good grip. The elastic and velcro at the wrist ensures they will not slip off when you pull your hand out of the folded flag.<br /><br />I ordered a Small to ensure a snug fit. The fingers are VERY short--almost an inch too short, but the rest of the glove fits and they'll get the job done."
2.0,"Super cute but this would be perfect for KIDS, not adults! Bought it for my 18 and 16 year olds and they‚Äôre more like ankle socks. (And they have small feet sz 6 and 5)"
2.0,The shorts lining doesn‚Äôt have any stretch. It‚Äôs also stitched below the waist of the skirt which makes it an awkward fit.
2.0,Broke after a single use. Looked pretty for that one use though!
2.0,"Great collection of wristbands but I wore mine biking yesterday and then to sleep (as with the fitbit versa 2, I track my sleep) and woke up with a rash only where the wristband is.<br /><br />Later added: it wasn't a heat rash. It did this on the other wrist as well. I gave the bands to a friend and it happened to her as well. There is something in the Chinese material that they use that is NOT good for your skin and WILL give you a rash."
2.0,Earrings ?
2.0,"Not cute and the fabric felt extremely cheap like a Halloween costume. This thing looked more like a cheap circus costume. Immediately started a return the moment I opened the package. Not happy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It did come with all things it said it would<br />It did fit, but I had to size up like 5 times to a 5 XL even though I'm only XL normally<br /><br />Cons:<br />Ugly in person<br />Itchy, gross fabric<br />10/10 would not recommend<br />Not true to size whatsoever"
2.0,Not sturdy. Made from vinyl or something.  Don't fit quite right due to material.  They look like men's horseshoes and they are just ugly.
2.0,The shirt and vest appear to be ok for kid size but the pants waist are too small.
2.0,"Good color as Expected, however it's tight and short arm or whatever you call it,"
2.0,"Ordered size small. I only weigh 122 lbs and I'm 5'3"" literally a small fry. The dress stops right below my butt cheeks! Definitely would have sized up to a large."
2.0,Looks very good but will break easily! I will buy others but I know they want last very long
2.0,"I tried to warn my husband against ordering the WESTLIGHT Bike Jerseys Bike Shirt due to sizing issues with clothing made in China and - no surprise!  - this shirt in 2xl fits like a US slim-fit large at best!  Also, it is very narrow in the shoulders and tight on the arms. Just an odd fit all the way around.<br /><br />It is made in China, and is labeled as hand wash only.  I have a front load washer, no agitator, and washed it on a gentle/hand wash cycle, let it air dry, and experienced no issues.<br /><br />The shirt is made with a lightweight, stretchy fabric.  It seems to be well made and has some nice features, but since the sizing is way off, and it's too narrow in the shoulders and tight on his biceps, my husband can't wear it to thoroughly test it and see if it is durable.  For these reasons, it is a fail for us, but if you are an overall trim-fit, including thin arms, this shirt might work for you.  Just remember to order two sizes larger than your normal size."
2.0,"Our son wears a 26, I ordered a 27, and these are still too small."
2.0,"The fit was very off on this. While the band width was fine, there's wasn't enough side coverage. And the straps cafhe. I wouldn't recommend this."
2.0,I have had this watch for just a few weeks and it no longer works. It is beautiful and I love the look but it does not work. :(
2.0,"This set is not the color ""Apricot"".<br />Parts of it look like a weird tan and other parts look mauve pink.<br />Also, the fabric is strange. I thought I was getting a fleece set because of the price, but it's not. It's a weird polyester/spandex.<br />I think it is WAY OVERPRICED FOR THE LOW QUALITY."
2.0,"Way too small and the material seemed cheap and flimsy. Will definitely be returning,"
2.0,Wayyy too small. I ordered a large (I'm a size 12) and it didn't go over my shoulders. Def buy larger then you normally would.
2.0,"It's definitely not chiffon... It's like a weird, slippery polyester. I'm 4' 11&#34;, weigh 100 pounds, and am a 34D. I usually wear an American Small, but ordered a Medium. The dress overall is too big, except in the chest which is too small and it simply lays strangely. The fabric is incredibly light and see-through. It looks cute online, but it's just not worth it in person."
2.0,"It‚Äôs a great idea, but the elastic cords are so thin, they don‚Äôt look good on fashion sneakers. Wish the elastic cord was either flat or thicker. The metal ends were fantastic. Wish this was sold as individuals."
2.0,"This is too thin to be advertised as a dress. It‚Äôs more like a long nightgown. This dress is so thin, you can see my underwear. It also fits larger than expected. I ordered a medium. The dress is also quite long. For someone my height (5‚Äô3‚Äù), this dress may be too long. The color is also not the same as the one advertised in the picture, and the style (cut) is a bit different as well."
2.0,"I was expecting the material to be sturdier but it's actually very light and thin, making the canopy to flop with strong wind.  I live in the area where there are a strong wind blowing constantly, and canopy does not stand the gusty wind."
2.0,Cute and comfortable band. Mine came apart after only 2 weeks of wear. Not worth it
2.0,Tighter than expected and the color isn‚Äôt red it‚Äôs like a neon orangey red
2.0,I followed other reviewers advice a sized up and when they came they were too big. Returned them
2.0,There isn't any give and it put deep lines and bruise on my cheeks. I removed after 1 hour.  It is very pretty though.
2.0,the band is suffocating.  I'm a 36C and this did NOT fit.  Way too tight.
2.0,Came with a hole in seam
2.0,"Looks nice but for my girl too big and poofy, mind you I got the size XS."
2.0,"the chain changed colors real quick but i just put a different chain on the butterfly, its nice"
2.0,Not pure silver
2.0,"The material is great -- cute and lightweight. Unfortunately, the zipper was not sewn into the dress well, and after a handful of wears, the zipper broke. It was not my two-year-old zipping it either, so it was not due to her pulling on it. It was always hard to get the zipper past the waist area because it was sewn too tightly around the midsection where the top meets the skirt portion. After a handful of wears, about 6 months after purchasing the dress, the zipper broke."
2.0,Not the quality product I had hoped for. They do not fit the curve of the eyeglass frame well and the brackets that hold the glasses to the frame are too tight in most cases. The lenses themselves are nice. I probably won't get as much use from these as I had hoped.
2.0,"I usually wear an XL in shirts like this, but I sized up because of some reviewer comments.  Unfortunately, sizing up didn't help.  This shirt is extremely small.  The arms are tight (which is very unusual in shirts like this), and I was unable to button it.  I re-checked the size chart after I received the shirt, and the numbers for XXL should have fit me with plenty of room to spare.  But no, this shirt is way too small.<br /><br />That said, I do like the feel of the fabric.  It's silky and comfortable-feeling.  But the washing instructions suggest hanging this shirt to dry after washing (and then ironing it).  The fabric does wrinkle a lot.  That's definitely a negative.<br /><br />Overall, the shirt I received looked nothing like the one in the product pictures.  I expected an oversized fit.  But no, not even close."
2.0,I bought my normal size shirt (2x). It was very snug and fit like an XL.
2.0,The description says black but they are actually a navy blue color. The legs arw ver wide and very long. The tag says do not machine wash. Not what I expected.
2.0,I wear an XL this skirt is a medium but states XL . I needed it for an event. I had to go to Target and buy a skirt.
2.0,While I love the color and when I first got this the magnets keep moving and attaching to other things.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,They work not as good as my previous pair they make oncomeing headlights blury yellow blob other pair just nocked the brightness. I give them a 2 1/2 out of 5.
2.0,Material is too thin and cheap looking
2.0,the material wasn't that good
2.0,"You can tell that the mask has 4 layers and it feels very protective. The fit is too small for an average adult, though. After about 10 minutes my nose starts to hurt from the pressure of the mask on it, and no amount of adjustment seems to help. The ear loops also start to hurt my ears after a few minutes. There is a chemical smell to the mask as well, which may fade if you air them out."
2.0,nice but very thin.
2.0,"Very very thin, not like a real ""buff"" my husband wears for work. They are made out of a weird feeling material that I don't think would be comfortable on your face all day. Probably are not IF protection like the description states."
2.0,"Doesn't actually fit padded bra's, which is why I got it.  The quality is nice and i like the compartments.  Wouldn't buy again though"
2.0,"Not like the photo at all, terrible paint job....would not suggest getting this."
2.0,Beautiful dress. The fit was great except it was really tight in the arms to the point that I'll need to return it. Everywhere else was a great fit. The  other reason I'm giving only two stars is because the print was messed up on the front. There are snags and white spots where it should be color.
2.0,The rose gold is pretty. Bought this for granddaughter but she hasn't taken it out of the cellophane wrap yet because it doesn't look sturdy. I'm not paying to ship back.
2.0,Advertising makes it appear you get several of these when you get ONE.
2.0,does't work for me
2.0,"I had to return this and another item.<br />Well the pea coat was too small, it was an XXL and it fit like a Large. The return process was horribly slow and took weeks to get my money back."
2.0,"Paper-thin. Wrinkled,crinkled after wash"
2.0,Fall apart easily
2.0,Magnets aren't strong.  Earrings fell off.
2.0,Ordered 2 sets for each of my kids and they pulled them right off. No struggling
2.0,I must say that these are not what was expected at all.  I had such high hopes! They don't compress in the truest sense of the word--eliminating the air--they just JAM the stuff into a smaller sack. Which then lays in a LUMP in your suitcase.  The 2 they call LARGE are so small they are almost worthless.  I own a bunch of packing cubes. Love them.  These are by far the worst purchase I have made for effective packing.
2.0,"Better to spend a 20 extra dollars for something a little bit better and durable, cheap material"
2.0,"The fabric is really stretchy and the color is great, but it's terribly hot and unflattering. Baggy and awkward. I'm 5'4"" and 125lbs and ordered a small, based on the sizing chart and recommendations. Maybe it's just not the right cut for my body type, but I was pretty disappointed. I'm going to do some alterations and try to make it work. Lesson learned."
2.0,"The one I received was pretty poorly made. It looks good enough I suppose, and I do use it, but it fell short of expectations. It is big, but not as big as it appears on the girl in the picture. She must be tiny. One inside pocket was not sown, and an outside zipper doesn't work. This isn't a bag I would recommend."
2.0,had i 2 days and one of the side zippers won't stay zipped.  the teeth aren't aligned.
2.0,This is way too big to look realistic. It looks too spaced out and silly
2.0,I know the dress was only $24 but the quality was not good.
2.0,"lowww quality. i was expecting something much better than what i recieved, however it was very inexpensive so i guess thats ok."
2.0,Not even close to the size it's supposed to be.
2.0,Very cute but it‚Äôs very hard to open without fear or breaking it.
2.0,"I didn't like the fit or material of this dress. I am 5'7"", 180lbs and ordered a Large.<br />I think it would look cute one someone, just not for me. It made my chest seem wider due to the armpit ruffles and was too short for my booty. The material was very light and thin (kinda cheap) but not see through. But I did like the elastic waist band!"
2.0,It messes with your peripheral vision.
2.0,bought a large I only way 140 lbs and could not get socks on. runs way small sizing
2.0,They look great in the photos but I didn‚Äôt care for them as much as I had hoped for.
2.0,I'm normally a size 10 with caves and thighs on the thicker side. I bought a size 11 and it barely fits. Its a struggle to get them on. You need to have thin thighs to wear these. Great pattern but that's all I can say....
2.0,Had to buy a second one. After wearing for a day it starts falling apart. I do not recommend.
2.0,Fits weird. Thin and cheap.
2.0,"Pictured with a navy dress to give an idea of how light the ""navy"" color is. Not anywhere near as vibrant as the one in the ad. It's kind of got a Grey hue to it.  Pockets are not actually big enough for your hands to go in. Quality is mediocre. And sizing is SMALL.  I ordered my normal size but was like the kid in The Christmas Story ""I can't move my arms"" . Definitely need to order up by at least one size. It also doesn't have much structure, the collar doesn't lay like the photos, it's just straight up and down, no angle out."
2.0,"They don't last long, they were coming apart near seams when we received them."
2.0,"The dress that was sent to me was not the pictured item. What was sent has a white collar and black dress, cannot be worn for what it was purchased for. Size runs smaller."
2.0,"What a disappointment!! I bought these last year and they came in SEPARATE creative packages with all 4 colors in a great package... So, I thought I was ordering the same thing! These were suppose to be goody bag gifts.  They came all LOOSE!!!!! Very disappointed.  Please change the description as that is NOT what the description says.  Thank you"
2.0,"I wear 13 shoes, and they are correct. The seller said it would wear small. It does, but, I don't understand why they don't just mark sixe 12 slippers &#34;size 12&#34;."
2.0,Bought this for my wife and she loved it.  When she opened it she was sadly disappointed because there were stones that fell off and was sitting in the bottom of the bag. She loves it so much she's just gonna glue it. Maybe the packaging could be better so the stones don't get hit during delivery.
2.0,"I initially liked this visor, however it snapped in several places along the headband very early on, making it unusable. Sadly, I cannot recommend as I have to purchase another and I only purchased this last month."
2.0,The material is nice and soft which is a plus. But I ordered a size up just to be safe and it's still way smaller than I expected. Almost looks like the size of a sweater. Purchased for the hospital stay after I have my baby and definitely will not be using since it's too small
2.0,"Muy grande, acabado barato."
2.0,Looks beautiful a little small but should of fit just fine but broke before I could even try it on
2.0,"I'm sad to say I was disappointed with this item, five minutes after I put it on my ankle it broke. Luckily I was still home so I found it. The link that joins it to the fastener bit had opened up. It is very pretty though and I really liked it, just isn't sturdy enough."
2.0,"While this is super cute, it broke within a few days. I bought another one again hoping it was just a bad one, but the next one I bought broke again in a few days again."
2.0,"I have a number of these watch bands, and they are quite fine.  I ordered this one, as I wanted this shade of purple, as shown in the picture.  The band is actually more of a berry color, which is quite pretty, but it is not the color I expected."
2.0,These are pretty but smaller than I anticipated - really small. I can't say they are worth the price.
2.0,Teenage girl sizing not womens as stated... :(
2.0,the stitching on the sides are for Narrow people.
2.0,"If I had paid $5-$7 for this, I'd keep it. It's obviously cheaply made and the sleeves are slightly too taught. There's no stretch or forgiveness at all when you reach your arms. They shrink right up your arms, exposing up to my elbow.<br />Overall the fit isn't horrible. It's loosely fit and long enough, but the sleeves are just not quite long enough/forgiving enough for me. Colors were as expected."
2.0,no earrings  but lovely necklace
2.0,Broke right away. Disappointed.
2.0,"I know these are in Chinese sizes but legit, they must be Chinese dwarf sizes. Ordered the 18 figuring it would fit like a typical women's xl versus an xxxl, but it's more like a M/L max. Very starchy and not soft, sleeves are super tight too. Oh and if you have D's don't even bother thinking this will button close"
2.0,Small at top and to long pants
2.0,Too small. I ordered a 3xl hoping for an oversized fit. But this fits more like a small xl. I gave it to a petite friend to wear over leggings. One thing I really liked was the length of the sleeves though. Went right to the elbow. So covered my problem area nicely. The fabric wasn't very stretchy and felt more cotton like in my opinion.
2.0,The dress is pretty but low quality.
2.0,"Waterproof, but not very warm."
2.0,A pair of the 3 earrings did not latch closed. I have yet to get the new set even though the returned item made it back 7 days ago.
2.0,"Cut is weird and doesn't fit comfortably. Smaller than expected. Beautiful, soft material though."
2.0,"When I Got This, I Was Glad It Had The Same Picture, But The Material Sucks. It Never Stays Put. It's Always Falling. If You Have A Huge Head, It Might Work! üòÑ<br />I'd Say Spend The Extra Few Dollars And Get Something Better."
2.0,Bought this in both black and blue and thought it would be a cute addition to my summer dresses.  It was very cheaply made and returned before washing (it seemed like it would not hold up after one wash).  I gave it 2 stars because I like the length and knot is super cute!
2.0,"Runs big, zipper hanging down off side looks cheap."
2.0,"The colors in mine look absolutely NOTHING at all like this one. There are no bright, vibrant colors at all. It is all dark and muted."
2.0,"Very cute, but very disappointed as it broke the second time I wore it. The links are very cheap and it easily came apart. I‚Äôm super bummed."
2.0,Fits fine. Sweatshirt is NOT the style in picture. It is extremely soft but does not look anything like the picture shown. The print is the sane but absolutely not the same sweatshirt style.
2.0,Material was practically see through and the buttons didn‚Äôt stay closed. They are comfortable but light weight. I‚Äôm just personally not comfortable with them being see through.
2.0,"I felt like the pockets on this really stuck out. They did not lay flat against my hips, so I felt like I looked bigger than normal in this dress."
2.0,"The material has a stiff feel. Maybe that would go away after a washing, but after trying them on, I found them to be more full than I wanted, so...<br />another Salvation Army donation."
2.0,Very basic shorts. Made for weekends at home.
2.0,not good sizing
2.0,Wish I would've read reviews before purchasing this bag. I love the look and design of the bag but it smells like dead fish. Bag came with a suggestion card to try various things to get the smell out (as sellers know the bags smell). Nothing worked.
2.0,Smelled funny and was smashed in box. Question the leather part!
2.0,The set was for my wedding and few diamond's missing ü•∫
2.0,I wore this shirt twice. I washed it on cold and let it air dry. It ripped after only washing it once. Very disappointing.
2.0,Product was see through.
2.0,Poor quality  material.  It doesn't look like the picture
2.0,Did not like the fabric. Too stiff and not comfortable
2.0,The fabric is slick and it slides off the face if you move too much.
2.0,not as pictured - disappointing
2.0,"The bottoms on this suit are a BRAZILIAN cut. If you have a small tush maybe it's fine, but it's very inappropriate on me."
2.0,Its Ok for the price
2.0,"It is not possible to change the size of the band. It fits like a bangle.<br /><br />But, at least it works, which is better than I can say of other watches I've gotten on Amazon for less!"
2.0,I‚Äôm a guy and these fit so tight it even affects your talking so thin won‚Äôt stop or prevent anything just around my neck it‚Äôs tight waste of money for me just literally handed them to smaller friends and family not 1 size fits all unless you max out at 5‚Äô5‚Äù and a 125pounds tiny head
2.0,"the dress was somewhat to small, and to young for me. unfortunately I will have to keep hunting for another outfit for my son's wedding."
2.0,Item is very large and VERY heavy before you even put a single item in the bag. Very upset that Amazon is now charging for the shipping return. This was one of the selling features of purchasing from Amazon. Now I  will be reconsidering future purchases.
2.0,"Very disappointing, especially at the price. The pants are super thin...not at all lined with anything. I'd purposely gotten these to have another pair of pants to wear in the winter. These aren't even as warm as unlined leggings. Possibly the coldest choice for a pair of pants."
2.0,Does NOT cover up tattoos!!!!! I have a full sleeve on my right are that I have to cover for work and I bought these in hopes that it would cover it so I would not have to wear a long sleeve shirt all day. You can VERY clearly see all the details in my tattoo for wrist to were my shirt sleeve starts. So if this is the reason for you are looking at this product just move along......
2.0,Runs incredibly small.  A person that normally wears an L would likely need an XXL following this sizing
2.0,The bag was not what I expected.  Leather grain was just ok. I have returned the item for refund.
2.0,Pretty expensive considering they were not evenly coated in gold and several were bent at the bottom of the lightning bolt. I had enough for what I needed them for to not have to hand out bent ones but I was still disappointed.
2.0,"This is the second pack of these exact socks that I've ordered. The first pack was a perfect fit. The second, however (same seller, same product) was narrower and shorter than the first. Good grief! They are quite stretchy, so I can generally get by. But what a disappointment that there is isn't more consistency among the packages."
2.0,I may have ordered a size 2 big thinking it was going to fit smaller but initially I should have stuck with my gut and got the 2 x instead of the 3x
2.0,Very see through. Disappointed. But it‚Äôs soft so I guess that‚Äôs a plus. I‚Äôll be wearing this as a night shirt or swim top cover.
2.0,Very cheaply made... the pin part in back fell off immediately upon opening.
2.0,"The rings looks like the photos so i'm pleased about that,  however they run pretty small even for mid finger rings.  I have skinny fingers but at least 3 of the rings do not fit my pointer and middle finger. I would not purchase these again."
2.0,shrunk in length..........had to give it away.
2.0,Not what I ordered. This skirt is no where near as long as it's pictured..... I don't know who they figured it would hit the floor with but I wanted a LONG flows skirt. Color was right I guess
2.0,update review the zipper is plastic and the started coming off one by one and now the zipper came off and i cant even close my purse now.. disappointed<br /><br />KINDA A LONG BUT I ADDED ADDITIONAL HOLES TO THE STRAP NOW ITS FINE. NOT BAD
2.0,"First time my 3 year old wore these , the whole front of the shoe got scuffed up and the leather peeled off"
2.0,"This necklace is so pretty. However the hardware is so flimsy and not strong enough to hold the heavy weight of the beads. Straight out of the package I tried to put it on, and the chain links completely pulled apart."
2.0,Very disappointed.. pictures looks like ‚ÄúT-shirt ‚Äú material- it‚Äôs grandma polyester/rayon<br />I gave it to my neighbor<br />Nothing like the picture
2.0,Wish this fit right but it just didn‚Äôt maybe I should have sized up. The cups on top are just off a bit.
2.0,"Great variety of colors, but the posts are very rigid, all the edges are extremely sharp, and after a few days of wear my piercing got very irritated and completely inflamed. I can't be sure, but it seems like the posts may be made of acrylic, NOT bioplast. Only keeping them to use the tops with other bioplast posts from a different vendor."
2.0,I was disappointed with this product. It looks cheap and not what I was expecting
2.0,"This doom cap only fit the crown of the head, I assumed this was a full caption when I purchased it and it doesn't stretch"
2.0,I live in a very humid place and this material does not breathe at all. I wanted to wear this shirt to an outdoors event but I could barely tolerate it in my air conditioned living room. It's a stretchy material but maybe better for people who live in colder climates.
2.0,"Cute, and arrived timely, but missing a piece."
2.0,"Washed on gentle,cold cycle  before my kids need wear them for school school.  Threading ripped out of seam before they had opportunity to wear. Really bummed"
2.0,Sizing is way off and the seam was ripped upon receiving. Clearly no quality control! Material is paper thin.
2.0,I exchanged for s size smaller but now too small and not very comfy! Unfortunately I took tags off so cannot return....wasted $$
2.0,Very pretty and waaayyy too small. The fabric is not at all stretchy. The arms might fit a 10-year old‚Äî and that‚Äôs the largest size. Poorly designed.
2.0,"So this it titled, ""Women Tank Top for girls wearing"". I missed the girls wearing part. Ordered and they are tight. Will give to my teenager as this is not for curvy women. Please fix the title of your product."
2.0,The hat is cute but it doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. The brim is much smaller and it is almost impossible to shape it after you un box it.
2.0,The print was too thick. The shirt was smaller than expected. The sizing was more for kids.
2.0,Way too thick to breathe comfortably thru. I was at Physical Therapy the first time I wore one. I was panting and gasping which is unusual for me. They took my oxygen level and it was 83. I changed masks and in 5 minutes it was back up to 95. Threw it out.
2.0,"Decent quality materials, sizing is awkward, very large in the chest and very small in the waist/hips. I sized up and it does not fit."
2.0,"Very nice looking shoe however makes a lot of noise when walking with with foot surface , toes slip around making loud noises ,"
2.0,"I was not able to screw these in all the way, and I lost one within a few hours..."
2.0,"Ordered XXXXL because other's said out ran small.  Well,  my daughter wears an XL and this is more like a large."
2.0,Material feel very cheap.
2.0,Look good and sparkly but felt low quality. Flimsy links. Not my favorite. Returned.
2.0,Cute shirts ..just dont dry picture comes off
2.0,Key chain joint broke before it was a year old.  Do not buy.
2.0,"The elastic curled up weirdly after a few wears and I had to cut the skirt open to fix it.<br /><br />Aside from that, it was a pretty good skirt."
2.0,"We received only 5 pairs of the advertised 6 pairs.  The sixth pair seems to have been torn out of the packaging, so not sure if this is a product problem or a packaging problem.  Either ways, this is the first time we have had something missing from an Amazon order.  On the positive side, the socks look nice and will very likely fit the baby well."
2.0,It wasnt the way i want it but cool
2.0,Looks very cheap. I returned it
2.0,Way to small for my but will fit my 6 year old perfectly in a year or 2
2.0,"bought these for our youngest kiddos. masks are very tight around the nose and the ear loop holes are not placed correctly, so they are essentially unusable. loved the pattern but was very disappointed in the construct, as they are essentially unusable."
2.0,I got an x-large and it fits like a medium.
2.0,The back just old fly off out of nowhere... And for some reason they're difficult to put on by yourself because you have to put the bar on the needle and then through your ear and then a back and everybody that helps me drops pieces everywhere
2.0,such a cute coat. maybe the side flaps would eventually settle down and not stick straight out (in the picture it looks like they fold back) This coat was a little tight through the shoulders though the measurements made me think it would fit but I'm returning due to the snag factor. it snags on it's own zipper. It snags on it the snags! I wore it once and it's all snagged. Boo! so cute just an epic fail
2.0,I ordered a pair a year ago but since thenilost weight so I ordered another pair cause I liked the first pair. The shorts I recieved were made different.
2.0,"While this was a gorgeous dress, it was smaller than normal. The arms were much smaller than normal and I couldn't put my arms in the dress, therefore, it was returned asap."
2.0,"I had ordered the bevies and butted ones and got these stupid Hawaiian ones instead, was super peeved."
2.0,This dress was not made out of the material presented in the picture.
2.0,They fit okay. They look like jeans and not too much like leggings which is nice. But the zipper is defective. It doesn't work at all and i cant wear these pants until i replace the zipper.
2.0,Did not receive the hole puncher with the belt which was the entire reason for choosing this belt over others.
2.0,"Selene Nightgowns Womens V Neck Loungewear Short Sleeve Night Dress is made in China of 53% rayon and 47% polyester. It is machine washable in cold water but can not be tumbled dry.<br /><br />This is not neatly finished.  The sewing has a lot of defective stitches which were just left uncorrected.  The raw edges are serger finished but the threads ends were not clipped and just left hanging.<br /><br />The unstructured style appealed to me as did the light grey color so I got this nightgown in size Small for my 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 108 pound frame.  It is the right size for me but the material is the problem.  It feels heavier than it actually is and is not something that I could wear most of the year in the hot and humid South.  The cut and design doesn‚Äôt make it a good choice for cold weather either.<br /><br />What makes this nightgown even more problematic for me is the fact that the material clings to my body.  It feels very scratchy and uncomfortable against my sensitive skin.<br /><br />Selene Nightgowns Womens V Neck Loungewear Short Sleeve is just not a comfortable garment for me.  The material is less than optimal and is poorly finished."
2.0,Dose not fit the watch
2.0,"The scare it self is beautiful ,could not wait to get it , although it has a small pull in it , it looks like it was sliced in the Warehouse or wherever it comes from, Small pool bothers me but I don‚Äôt wanna return it I just wish it was as perfect and we don‚Äôt have , to worry about it becoming a hole , I was going to think of returning it but my son loved it so much and waited for so long just a little disappointed that‚Äôs all, Scarf it‚Äôs self is awesome"
2.0,"The costume arrived and it was way too large.  It could have a been a cool costume, but there were no size options and therefore you are taking a blind leap when you order this from a fit standpoint."
2.0,"One of the earrings had imperfections in the teardrop portion of the metal, so I would have returned these anyway.  But in addition, the wires are very thick and wouldn‚Äôt go through my earlobes."
2.0,Thought I was getting black and white. It was actually blue and white.
2.0,I loved the color but i wore it and same day it was torn.
2.0,After 1 week of wearing laces are tearing apart‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame too because they are light weight and look nice.
2.0,It‚Äôs a nice shirt and I own others from SSLR that I like. But this time a medium wasn‚Äôt even close to right. The sleeves were way short.<br />Shame... like the shirt and if it were the same size as others from the brand it would be 5 stars.
2.0,Product took months to arrive. Material was extremely thin and it was short in my opinion. Cute design though.
2.0,Smaller than I thought it would be also did not expect it to be transparent but my mother loved it !!
2.0,"I usually wear a size 6, so I ordered a size 6 and they were a little large; the width was about right but the boots were a half size too long.  They would need to be worn with really thick socks.  I returned them because I didn't like the height of the boots.  I am 5'1&#34; and the top of the boots only reached mid-calf, which made my legs look short and wide.  They may be good boots, but they were not what I was looking for.  I bought another pair of size 6 Frye boots (Smith Engineer Tall Square) and they fit perfectly, so it may be just this style that didn't fit right."
2.0,I in a freezer all day at 2 degrees and my feet do not stay warm as I thought they would I have to wear 2 pair and my feet still get numb and cold.
2.0,Not authentic Pandora....lets hope it last...
2.0,"Great until it broke after three weeks.<br />This was my favorite strap - looks good, comfortable, easy to take watch on/off, until one end detached from the fastener as I took my watch off for charging. I‚Äôm almost tempted to order another in the hope it‚Äôll last longer - I liked it that much."
2.0,I'm not too fond of these-they did fit my 7.5&#34; wrist though.  The hair ties do not stay on. They are pretty and I wore one for a week just as a bracelet-it didn't irritate my skin either.  I really needed it to hold a hair tie though.
2.0,I am usually a size medium in most costumes and I ordered a large just to be safe. I tried to put it on and it feels like a small and the skirt barely covered half of my butt. Disappointed and returning
2.0,Too bulky to fit on the watch
2.0,Rotator Cuff Surgery. Laundered it on delicate only 3 times and when I went to unsnap the snaps they stayed together and came away from the fabric.  Too bad because its a good fit and nice fabric. Of course the snap issue was on the side of the surgery shoulder .
2.0,This shall falls off all day long and constantly needs adjusting.
2.0,so pretty in pictures but i had to return it because the glitter was falling a part everywhere loosely and it looked like it was very haphazardly made by hand. the bottom hem of the dress was uneven. it was for a gatsby party and i had to return it as it looked like a diy halloween costume
2.0,My son wore these twice and the broke
2.0,"I wish I could give this a higher rating...Here's my review:<br /><br />The Good:<br />-  If I am sitting down, not exerting myself and not doing anything, this is comfortable.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-  The band rolled up some/often when doing jumping jacks or jogging in place.<br /><br />The Painful:<br />- I couldn't finish an exercise program wearing this, couldn't even make it 8 minutes into the exercise video. This, hurt, to, wear. The shoulder straps are not padded, or, if they are, it's akin to the material digging into your skin. And the back straps are positioned oddly. It was so uncomfortable to wear, again, I couldn't finish the exercise video and switched sports bras.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />- Don't buy<br />- I have heard many great things about this sports bra brand but perhaps the price was lower than all of the other bras for a reason. I REALLY had high hopes for this, finding a reasonable priced sports bra, high impact at that, in my size. I will state this, if you are slender along the back and shoulders and have a smaller chest? Perhaps this will be more comfortable. But I am not that person, and this was painful to wear.<br /><br />Impact Level: Unknown, couldn't wear it long enough to tell<br />Comfort: VERY uncomfortable<br />Moisture wicking functions?:  Unknown, couldn't wear it long enough to tell"
2.0,"The mulit-color ring is solid, the 2 silver ones are split. Too small when trying on so I separated them and just wear the multi color one. These are suppose to be able to roll over themselves and glide but nope they don't. Was going to return but decided to keep it because I like the one."
2.0,"When I bought this mask, it said it was washable and reusable - which is the main reason I bought it.<br />However, like the other reviews, this mask is NOT washable.<br /><br />I haven't worn this yet because I'm saving it for a rainy day when I really need it.<br />Or I might return it. Either way, this isn't worth your money or time."
2.0,Very small.  I am an adult Male and these simply do not fit.  They might be goo for a child's face.
2.0,"Disappointed - very, very light/flimsy"
2.0,The costume was alright but what really upsets me is that the bust is completely defective as if it‚Äôs for someone who is completely flat chested.
2.0,Felt very cheap. I assumed it would be flattering and be slimmer around the waist. Unfortunately very baggy.
2.0,Bright pink is NOT the same color as the pictures. Much more muted and dusty. Bought for a neon party and returned. Not bright at all but fit was good. I would compare to gymshark look and feel.
2.0,Didn't like the color of this dress.
2.0,"They fit great around waist, and the material was comfortable.  But the cut was odd and made for a super lo0ng extra saggy crotch."
2.0,"Great product, but breaks too easy."
2.0,"Way too small, I ordered a size XXL. I am 5'11 and 230lbs and wear a size 14-16. This shirt was skin tight and was extremely uncomfortable. I returned product."
2.0,This top does not open in the front. The buttons are for decorative purposes. I cannot comment on how it fits because I needed a button up sleeveless shirt due to arm injury.
2.0,"Cute fabric, but weird fit"
2.0,Felt from my bed and broke instantly. My laptop survived to worst accidents.
2.0,"I got this as a gift for a friend of mine that lives out of town. It's cute and arrived on time. My issue is that it was suppose to have two charms along with the strong is beautiful,  A kettle ball and a barbell.  It did not have the kettle ball charm. This is a gift sent far from me so I cannot ask for it back to return. She doesn't know it's missing a charm but I do, Very disappointed.<br />I can't get it back to return or exchange and I don't want to tell her it's wrong. But I didn't get what I paid for. What do you suggest for a remedy?"
2.0,"$10 Leggings, I can't complain too much, and I'm not really overly concerned about the folks seeing my butt at the gym - but yeah, they're see-through when you squat. I got the XL navy and it was probably a size too small (I am size 14) but if they weren't see through I would say great fit! Just maybe more fabric would prevent the sheer effect when squatting. Your shape will look great - just have to be mindful of your underwear choice!"
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this swimsuit, and it was my biggest miss so far. The bottoms were very cheeky, which I hadn‚Äôt realized from the photos. The top was too large for me, and the straps didn‚Äôt adjust enough. It may work better for someone larger chested. The material seemed nice and the suit well made, but the fit was a miss all around."
2.0,"Fabric is cheap, see through and overpriced. Bad quality. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying."
2.0,Delivery was great for the package when I received it I opened it up and the seam on one of the legs wasn‚Äôt even stitched I had to re-sew. It runs a little large cheaply made.
2.0,"Dulls after wearing one day, NOTHING got on them, are cloudy now. Very top heavy, needs bigger backing.<br />Definitely Not worth $70, does not look like my 7 pieces of Moissanite."
2.0,"Wish I wouldn't have bought it. Its extremely sharp, right on your wrist. My husband constantly cuts himself or one of the kids when he wears it. I got rid of it."
2.0,"This coat comes in womens sizes,  I ordered 2xl and it was way small! I gave it to a 5'9"" girl and it was just alittle big on her"
2.0,"I bought this case to hold my credit cards, etc.  so I expected it to have some sort of pockets inside for easy removal of individual cards.  I have a case made by another company and they have pockets inside.  What I found was an elastic band on each side.  It has some sort of clasp so that you can detach the elastic but it is not easy to do.  With this arrangement I would have to take out all of the cards on one side and sort through them to find the one I want.  Also, it is not as thick as the usual case you find on the market so it doesn't hold as many cards.  I tried putting in my cards just to try it out but I was immediately dissatisfied with the result.<br />I must admit this is my fault.  When I looked at the product description again I found there was another photo which showed the inside but I hadn't noticed that photo.  I've learned my lesson.  Be sure to look at all of the photos.<br />Otherwise, it is well-built and attractive.  I gave it to my husband and he plans to use it as a cigarette holder which is probably what it was intended for."
2.0,"This crown has clear plastic straws between each of the flowers.  I did not expect that and felt that it made the quality look cheap.  If you are looking for an everyday play piece, then this would be fine.  But if you are looking for an accessory to a well made outfit or costume, then I would look elsewhere."
2.0,Runs small and if you have any kind of bicep I do recommend.  Stitching is right where your muscle flexes.
2.0,"So far so good! I‚Äôve been using it for two weeks to get used to it before my trip to Europe. Good size, good quality. Worked well for my Disney trip as well.<br /><br />Edit: currently in Europe where it‚Äôs been raining off and on, not super hard... and the inside of this bag is wet. Super disappointed."
2.0,These are not as good as days 8
2.0,I got an XS because I wanted compression but that was big. I usually wear a s/M top
2.0,"It‚Äôs ok, rather thin. Length is ok but not close to be a choker"
2.0,Tops of socks falling apart and outfit runs large.
2.0,"I purchased these bands because I like the stretch bands. These bands do not adjust. There is a slide for sizing, but it doesn‚Äôt move. Waste of money"
2.0,Thought they were good glasses for the price until the frame broke within the first week.  Returned.
2.0,Shoes are way too narrow and not long enough. Fit for the size 12 I ordered is more like a size 9.
2.0,This is a cute dress with a lovely vibrant color. It was shorter than i expected and it had some stitching coming loose as well.  I'm 5'4&#34; and 115 pounds and this dress was a little big on me. Not huge but not as form fitting as it should be. The dress fell roughly 1-2&#34; above my knee
2.0,"Every time I go to use the rosary,it falls apart at the various links.  So far in the past several weeks I have had to repair it. I don't like having to take a pair of pliers to church with me for on the spot repairs."
2.0,"I was super disappointed with this dress. Unless you're into the ""Little House on the Prairie"" aesthetic, it's not very pretty at all. The material is cheap looking, and it's got such an old fashioned/conservative shape. Gets a star because the color was really beautiful."
2.0,"This shirt pretty good, maybe a tiny bit on the larger size but I wouldn't bother going down a size...it would be too small then. Fabric is a little odd. Didn't look yet but probably a thick rayon.  The problem is that the black looks blue. I tried it on with black pants and it makes it look even more navy. Best with jeans or any pants that are not black. I bought it for work with black pants so I will probably return it."
2.0,"The pennies fit as expected, they were a nice medium between adult and youth, so the kids I coach can wear them without worrying about them being too small for the bigger kids or too big for the smaller kids.... But the pennies are PINK not a red or orange shade as I expected. I do coach boys Youth Soccer so while I didn't have the time to send them back it's a little frustrating."
2.0,i wanted to like these so bad because they‚Äôre so cute but they‚Äôre scratchy and see through on the black side. i ended up returning.
2.0,"I ended up returning it. I did like the way the top layer flowed. It fit everywhere except for across the chest and arms. The material is stretchy but not enough. It made my arms look like sausages and crushed my chest. I am on the busty side (36D) but this shirt was not designed for anyone who has a little extra on top. I normally wear an L top but ordered an XL based on other reviews but that didn't seem to help at all. It was a good quality, long enough to wear with leggings and flattering. I am very sad that it didn't fit in the chest and arms."
2.0,I ordered a Med and they sent a small.  To return I have to pay for shipping back to China and wait however long that takes for a refund.  The small fits and the waffle material is cute but the Teal color is a bit see through.  Going to keep this for a beach cover up and won't be ordering from them again.
2.0,Lasted six months and then the clip broke.
2.0,the band is not the same quality as the original Polar strap. the slider button that's used to attach it to the polar watch even broke off and I had to resort to installing it the old way.  I have since ditched it and gone back to the original polar strap.
2.0,Waist band too small.
2.0,"waaaaaaaaaay too small....  I gave them to my wife who wears a size 7..  and they are just barely too big...  i wear a 12 shoe....  these don't even come close, laughable after one wash...  they do however seem well made."
2.0,"I bought a size bigger than I usually wear so that it would be loose. Instead, the sleeves were too tight for it to be comfortable"
2.0,Material was not what I expected and didn't fit.
2.0,"The material is shiny like polyester, and shows every little bump or line underneath. Can't really wear out of my house."
2.0,"the dress in itself is gorgeous...BUT the waist is high (short)t from the shoulder down...it needed a good 3 inches for it to fit me properly, with the waist line to be in its  proper place..so very sorry."
2.0,When I selected this dress it showed in the picture a red dress not pink. I even asked since it said fuscia but showed red in the pictures and a customer answered it was in fact red. The dress I received was pink neither fuscia or red like the picture.
2.0,They dont fit well. They say in the legs! Aren't like jeans.
2.0,Not right to fit
2.0,"Doesn't look much like the photo, mostly just cloth and awkward construction. It is also huge, covers almost your whole face."
2.0,I loved the style of the dress however the dress was extremely thin. If you were to wear patterned panties they will definitely be visible.
2.0,"Hi all. I don't make very many negative reviews.  But this is beyond upsetting. I brought these last week. And this is one week of qeari g to school. This company does not color their foam.the sad thi g about these shoes is that they fit well, they look and feel well on my child. As well as reasonably price. I had to buy these in stead of our nomal higher end brand due to no one had size 13 anywhere. I would not recommending this brand . Sadly..."
2.0,The material is awful
2.0,Need to order two sizes up another waste of money
2.0,The Velcro tabs on the strap have all come detached after a week. I will have to hot glue them back on. I won‚Äôt be buying another watch strap from this company.
2.0,"Good for a couple of washes, but starts to form lint balls after a couple of washes. V-neck is also rather thin and tends to curls up."
2.0,"Poorly made... a lot of loose strings, stripes crooked...."
2.0,Looks nice but the magnets do not work....won't stick to anything. I bought it for the magnets so I am returning it...
2.0,Poor material ripped just like the last one I bought
2.0,"These pajamas are very soft and I like the style, but I could not get over how uncomfortable the waistband is. It kept rolling inside the fabric and was very this, so it was hard to roll back. Every time I sat down the elastic would roll and get tighter and uncomfortable. But... I did like how soft the material was, and the style of the bottoms (other than the waistband)."
2.0,Not true to size.  The red sleeves are not a vibrant red. They‚Äôre more an orange-red.
2.0,I'm 5'4&#34; 36D order need in white. Loved the fit. The 2 layers are completly see through. So disappointed in that.
2.0,"Did not fit. Would not stay on my foot. I returned them and got a refund but ended up paying the return postage, which was sizable."
2.0,"Wore out very quickly, not good material."
2.0,This was way too form fitting.  I had to send it back.  Not flattering at all for my figure.
2.0,wish I could return. color wont stay positioned
2.0,Lace is coming off the bottom of a couple of them
2.0,Inconsistent sizing. I bought two shirts one in black and the other in burgundy in XL. the black one fit perfectly but the burgundy was small.
2.0,"Nice soft material. However, it‚Äôs a small XL and I had to return."
2.0,"Very small!!! Don't think I can wear this to my event for fear of my hand turning purple. Only will work for a young girl with tiny wrists. Bummer, it's really beautiful."
2.0,I will never order again It's has been a problem with sizing
2.0,The sports bras ran small so size up. The fabric did not have much stretch so it was difficult getting them on. The straps also rubbed on my neck wrong and left red sore spots.
2.0,Its no the  the color that look.
2.0,The skirt was really cute but the top was mis-stitched resulting in the stripes being misaligned. Seller responded promptly with a refund.
2.0,"When I got these and put them on, I thought they were great and reminded me of my Oofos -- but they cost a lot less.  Then came the issue . . . I left them on our swim platform on the back of our boat.  Next time I went to put them on, I thought someone had taken my shoes and left theirs behind.  My size 10.5 womens was now I'm guessing closer to a size 8.  No longer big enough for my foot!  Waste of money unless you can keep them out of the sun.  I will note that, now that I've looked at the description (which I didn't do previously), it mentioned they'll shrink in the sun.  Well, gang, they aren't kidding about that!!"
2.0,Really cute sandals but very cheap made  my daughter use them like 3 times and one sandal ripped and the both detached from glued area that connects the bottom to the top
2.0,The scarf is very pretty but it is also very itchy. My daughter bought it for an event and couldn't wear it because it bothered her neck.
2.0,Prettydress for price but way too short!!
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 165 lbs, 36DD and I bought a Large. I have about a dozen tops from PattyBoutik and Large is my normal size in this brand. I was pretty disappointed with this top though. The fabric is uncomfortable: stiff, no stretch, thick, scratchy. I could barely get it on and it was very tight. Not for me so I ended up returning it."
2.0,"Received these today and they seem to be good quality. Not warped and the backs tightened easily. But it is very gold. A bit more than the picture. I thought they would be more subtle gold, but happy anyways.<br />UPDATE: THEY BROKE. The post broke from the flower within 2 weeks of receiving these. I didn't try to process a claim because by the time I found half of the broken earring it was too late. I am disappointed because these were very cute!"
2.0,"My daughter is almost 2, wearing 2T/3T sized clothes, and these ""baby"" hat, scarf, & mittens are way too big. Would better fit a 7 or 8 year old. Disappointed in having paid $26.99 for these, although they are cute and appear they would be warm for kids."
2.0,Broke within the first 2 hours of wearing it
2.0,Body is shorter than expected.
2.0,There is no cuff to keep materials from fraying or to prevent item from falling while you wear it which is why i bought it.. won't buy again
2.0,I would like to give the seller a chance to fix this problem.  I bought the necklace by the picture.  The chain I received was not the one pictured and was shorter than stated.  Seller said this problem will be fixed.  I hope so as its for my granddaughter.
2.0,"They are too tight on the nose.They are also much smaller than the ones my daughter bought for me. I will keep them, however not a great product."
2.0,"I absolutely loved these pants. Great fit, great feel, just perfect. Unfortunately, after only about 3 washes (washed as instructed) some of the seams are already coming apart down the inner legs. Guess they'll be scrappy jeans very soon. üòî"
2.0,"This looks like a cool face mask, but it is in fact very cold to use at trail speed. Inside the helmet your head is warm, but on my snowmobile rides my chin and jaw were so cold that I had to pull off the trail to warm. The fit however, was comfortable. Although it felt like a size to small when I put it over my head, once I got it on it felt great. This mask has a spider man tight fit that at first feels awkward, but soon feels right. The trim around the face was good and stayed in place and didn't stretch out, which was nice. The length is a bit too short as it tended to bunch up in the back after a while, and air leak would form on by back. I would not recommend this unless you use it on warm days of 30+, you drive at slower speeds, or have a high windshield. I gave it a 2 rating because it didn't do the thing that was most important, which was to keep me warm."
2.0,"Too small though I ordered the XL, I'm regular medium. I like the embroidery but sadlyI had to return it."
2.0,"First one arrived with a broken stone, they replaced it right away, now I‚Äôve had it for a little over a month and the second one is broken as well. It‚Äôs really pretty and fits nicely but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything if it keeps falling apart. Really disappointing"
2.0,Beautiful bracelet. Too loose on the wrists though. Also the magnetic clasp isn‚Äôt very firm. Tends to pop out and come loose when I flex my wristsüòíüòíüòí
2.0,"These are nice sunglasses, however, when you look at anything reflective, ANYTHING, car windows, tablets, ipads, your phone, etc. it looks like a hologram...really odd, and throws me off....I like my fair share of rainbows, but this is just cray."
2.0,"I LOVE the watchband itself, however the latch is a horrible pain in the a$$ to put on. The pin does not stay in place when not wearing the watch, making it easy to lose if dropped, which is easy to do when trying to put it on. After using it for a full week, it still takes me a minimum of 30 seconds to line everything up and get the pin stabbed through the right hole. 40 to 45 seconds is average. I'm typically rushing to get out the door in the mornings and this slows me down far more than I care for."
2.0,"I wish I'd gone on the Lige website first. Their watches were $39.00 direct. I feel this one was overpriced but I bought it anyway.  Then, after one day with this waterproof watch at the pool, the watchband fastener pin rusted and broke."
2.0,Dress has nice material. Unfortunately the belt is the only think that keeps the dress from looking like pajamas. Very disappointed in the style. You will have to fluff it ove the belt in order to get the desired look in the photo.
2.0,The zipper on the pocket is cheap and sticks terribly already and will break pretty soon.  If I knew that I wouldn't have purchased these shorts.
2.0,"I had purchased this item some time ago but just recently got to wear it.  I was shocked that it fit me so well, as I am petite 4'11"".  The waist -band is made with a very wide piece of elastic that does not give at all.  I washed it for the first time and this elastic  band crunched up inside the material that I can't straighten it out and it will not lay flat on my body.  I am so disappointed since the material and length are great."
2.0,The tunnels looks great but the tapers are measuring out to be the exact size as my 1/2 tapers? Not sure how this is helpful to stretch up to. Hopefully I‚Äôm be able to naturally stretch and use the tunnels. Bummer
2.0,Bought one.  It fell apart after one wearing.  Company replaced it.  Have worn it once.  Still waiting to see if the first one was a fluke.
2.0,Teeny....
2.0,"These are way too big for me, but fit my husband. They have the standard bells and whistles: nose piece, adjustable ear loops, filter pocket.<br /><br />However, while the outside layer may feel somewhat soft I wasn't really that impressed. I have other bamboo items, but in comparison this feels like typical rayon and not cozy soft like I was hoping. The inner liner is a bit of a scratchier cotton, you know the part that actually touches you. So the whole ""soft bamboo fabric"" claim is  useless. Since the part that actually touches your skin, isn't all that soft.<br /><br />They are easily foldable, so great for portability, but they have no structure so you end up inhaling them when you breath in or talk. These really are just basic cotton masks with a rayon outter layer. Not worth $10 each ($20 for the pair)."
2.0,The sleeves are huge
2.0,"Very cute, but watch out, it will stain everything. Never in my life have I found a piece of clothing that do violently turned all other items in the washer red. Not subtle pink wash, but crime-scene streaks of red on everything. Wash this only with other red clothing. üò¨"
2.0,"Was expecting the shirt to be black with gray on upper half, the gray is actually purple, overall like the shirt, but with the color on top it clashes with a lot of my golf shorts"
2.0,Beautiful art work but not good as a mask! If wearing to see you picture (which I had expected) you need to pull up over you forehead!  Design too big.  I should not have to cut holes in the fabric.
2.0,"Where the band is held on with a black 'button' or whatever it's called, this rubs and has given my daughter a blister so she now has to wear a bandaid every time she wears them to even be comfortable n them! I should've followed my gut feeling and ordered the original croc brand instead of going for this cheaper version üòè"
2.0,The slipper itself was very cute however it was VERY small the sizing guide provided in the listing did not seem accurate at all. We returned them.
2.0,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair from Saucony. The Saucony pair easily weathered a washing, these did not. The threading of one end of these has already unthreaded, leaving it to unravel for the rest of its usable life. I'll stick with the Saucony brand on this; it'll cost a bit more, but they will probably last longer."
2.0,These underwear are a weird material. They also roll down almost immediately. I got these to wear postpartum. Bad idea! Don‚Äôt buy these! I would have returned these but I already washed them to try on.
2.0,"I first purchase these Different Touch tanks through Walmart in a 2X. They were a little snug, so I decided to purchase the 3X. I purchased the 3X here on Amazon, and I am not satisfied. The 3X feels just as tight as the 2X. It feels like they put ‚Äú3X‚Äù on a 2X shirt, there is no different in the fitting or size my tanks. And to think, I brought 10 of these the 2nd time‚Ä¶SMH."
2.0,This jacket is super cute. A little short in the arms. The problem is I bought it to take on a vacation where it‚Äôs often rainy. To try it out I wore it outside to take out the trash today. When I came back in the top back half of my shirt was all wet! Ugh. I can imagine being cold and wet my entire vacation. üò° Glad I tried it first!
2.0,"I loved that the colors of the skirts came out as expected. However, after one wash, my skirts started to rip. The fabric was too soft. Even when I hand wash...the fabric seems to rip. But the colors are nice. Thats all."
2.0,"I was really excited for this armband to come in, I use it to hold my phone while I walk around at work, because as a woman--most clothes I own do not have pockets or pockets large enough for the enormous phones we have out now. After only two days of use the velcro has come off of the band--rendering this useless as a phone holder (its whole purpose?). I will give it two stars--I liked the speedy delivery and fabric."
2.0,"Fit is perfect. But the stitching is coning off after wearing twice, to the point that i cant wear them anymore"
2.0,"Super tight on the chest, buttons would not close properly"
2.0,These pj's are good quality but run big and they have a weird fit the crotch of these hang to your knees
2.0,Not long and doesn't fit well in front. My daughter likes it so I gave it to her or in would have returned it.
2.0,Bifocal no in a good position. Guess the one size fits all does not work for glasses.
2.0,"These are short and wide.<br />They are loose so they don‚Äôt hold you tight at all, and they are very short so they don‚Äôt even cover your entire body."
2.0,2 stones fell out in about a week but b4 that it was gorgeous
2.0,These were great til the second time my son wore them and the seam came apart at the toe and the stuffing came out I was pretty disappointed
2.0,"According to the size chart, I am not a medium. However, I was sent a 2X. Not sure if there is a size chart discrepancy, but if what you sent me is a 2X, then their sizes run extremely small. Also, the fabric isn't a &#34;cotton blend&#34;. Being a cotton blend would imply that the fabric is a majority or 50/50 blend of cotton with other fibers in the minority. It's a majority of polyester with a smaller portion of cotton. The fabric wasn't as light, breathable, and soft as I was expecting due to this. The fabric texture reminds me of an athletic jacket or &#34;swishy&#34; jogging pants.<br /><br />I'll also mention that the length of the culottes in the picture is very deceptive. They're at least 2 inches shorter than what the picture shows.<br /><br />I do like the large pockets. They're large enough to easily fit a wallet and a phone. That is the only reason I'm giving this product 2 stars."
2.0,the strap is too short to be a crossbody bag
2.0,TOO Tight at the band around the top.  They fit fine everywhere else so I don't think it was the wrong size.  I gave them away.
2.0,"This turned me green after two short wears (Under six hours each). I know for the price some materials are not made to last, but I expect a little more than this."
2.0,The material is soft and that's about the only positive thing I can say about these shirts. If you are extremely short and shaped like a cardboard box you will like them if not then trust me when I say do not buy these. I'm 5 ft 1 and have a small frame so for clothes to be too little for me says a lot.
2.0,First they sent me the wrong color. I ordered navy blue and got grey. This product would be better if there were bigger sizes. I'm not a big man either.
2.0,The material was a lot cheaper feeling and looking than I expected.
2.0,The instructions are very basic - they reference tools and items that aren't available with the kit.  There is no description of the tools included and the battery tester has no information with it.<br /><br />The quality of the vise is pretty poor - the watches I had wouldn't fit in the vise.
2.0,"After ordering this as a potential dress for my gender reveal, I tried it on. It fit very tightly to my body. I felt like a very improperly dressed muffin. I love the colors and wanted to like the dress, but it was a definite return."
2.0,"Since I saw the reviews about the size I order a XL dress, but what I did not expected was the surprise about the length. I'm 5'1&#34; and the dress sit just right above my hip. In order to wear it I must use a legging or a pant. The description should read &#34;very long shirt&#34; instead of mini dress. ."
2.0,"Much too wide considering the length.  I've tried to love this shirt, I really have.  I like other shirts in this style, but this one just doesn't seem to look good no matter how I style it.  I feel like it is made for a shorter person, but the width would be overwhelming on a smaller build."
2.0,"The colors were off, not like the picture. I looks like a sheet with strip without a belt and it doesn't come with one as stated in their description. I didn't like it at all. It's also kind of shiny."
2.0,These are decent tank tops. I purchased the size based on the size chart from the seller and they are still to big.  If I was to buy them I would by a size smaller then what they said to purchase.
2.0,"I bought this fir my 4 year old granddaughter who wanted to have a purse. She was very happy with it but, as a grandparent I was disappointed that the purse was open at the top so that when she played with it the contents would fall out. Not a great design for a little one."
2.0,"I like the color and the look, however, it was difficult to put on and the band broke within a few weeks."
2.0,This cap was way too big! It came down so far over my ears that I couldn't even put earbuds in. This is a cap definitely sized for men. Ladies beware!
2.0,Not great quality‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt have much stretch the hardware is very cheap almost feels like it‚Äôs going to break the first time you wear it and then it doesü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNot really worth the money better to buy a better quality built and have one than a bunch of smelly ones that don‚Äôt actually fit you
2.0,"Very low quality,  very flimsy.  Not anything like the old digital watches from the 1980s..."
2.0,Not long as described to be
2.0,Super cute! Love it!<br />Had a odd smell but after being washed [I was everything before putting it on my kidds] the smell came out.
2.0,The top broke off after a short time.
2.0,I LIKEED THE COLOR.<br />THE EARSOCKS ARE HARD TO REPLACE AND THE NOSEPIECES KEEP FALLING OFF.<br />I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE.
2.0,"Bodice was stiff, no give in the arms."
2.0,The first time I purchased these socks they were great.  But the second purchase came and the socks feel like they have gnarly knots of yarn woven into the soles.  They are very irritating to the bottom of my feet and I suspect would cause sores if I continue to wear them.  I won't buy these again unless the company can assure me that the fabric is soft and smooth inside.
2.0,True to size but I sent it back because the leaves around the collar made my baby look like an elf instead of a strawberry.
2.0,Fit perfect and very comfortable however look nothing picture. Suppose to be blue but look black.
2.0,Fits like an Asian size. I recommend ordering 2 sizes up
2.0,"This shirt was nothing like the photo. It did not have a v-neck as it said or gathered material as it appeared at the v. The material was also like a swim suit feel.<br />The shirt was cute, but nothing as expected so it was returned."
2.0,Material is so cheap it makes the dress look bad. Also runs Very small. Get 2 sizes bigger than you need.
2.0,Looked cheap. Sent it back
2.0,"after one wash in the washing machine on delicate they are fraying at the ends, oh boy"
2.0,The string on this bracelet is very flimsy.  It broke right away and I had to rethread all of the beads myself.  I love the beads though and the price made it not worth returning.
2.0,"Took it out of the package and it looked great at first. Noticed the top cups/triangles were on the smaller side, whatever it was going to be a tanning bikini anyways. Y'all. These were barely nipple covers, so if you are any bigger than a 34C (my size) then beware!! When I went to try it on, the stitches on the band snapped! Not very good quality at all really. The bottoms fit really well, VERY cheeky though.<br />2 stars bc it came on time. Will be returning"
2.0,didn't like the material very cheap looking.
2.0,When I received it four of the stones had already fallen out it should be sold with super glue
2.0,Too wide by a half inch
2.0,Had to cut slits into the ankle of the pants so that my 6 year olds slender feet can fit into them. Even still it is a struggle getting these things on. The fit is perfect outside of that fact.
2.0,These are very nice brooches but some were broken when I received them.
2.0,"The blue one I got was really nice. Soft, and true to size. The black one was mishapen and wide. After one wash I knew I'd only wear that around the house."
2.0,"It is a good design. However, the earring post was already bent a little when I opened the box. I am guessing this caused the backs to fall off the earrings so they were loose when I opened the box. The necklace chain was already tarnished on the end like someone had already worn it. And the other side of the necklace was already in a knot. I was excited about this set, but I think I either got a used set or one that some one bought and sent back."
2.0,I loved it but the material is so thin there was a small hole on the seem the 1st day I wore them.
2.0,Material is thin and practally see through
2.0,It's like a tube with elastic straps. Would have returned if shipping was free.
2.0,Sent back looked like a sack poorly made.
2.0,"I thought this would be an easy solution to my low back dress. It looked very simple from the picture and in the description. However, I had a really difficult time trying to figure out how it was supposed to strap on to my bra? My friend was also helping me out and she could not figure it out either. I'm not sure why this was. I wish it would've had some simple instructions with it. Maybe it's my fault, but I was very disappointed."
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt fit well.
2.0,Flowers are coming off
2.0,they were. The things I liked about the product. I loved the design and feather type weight and the phone mount pouch and credit card carriers. The price is good and was delivered quickly. but it's all downhill from there. They don't fit the average size Caucasian male nose I tried on all three pairs with the same result. I then tried running hot water over the bridge portion of the glasses to spread the bridge like on most eyeglass frames but that did not work.  When I did get them on they bit into my skin which was painful and the longest they would stay on is 10-15 seconds. The good news is they did not break when I tried to adjust them. Is there a larger size or a secret to fitting them correctly. I would appreciate any help.<br />Thanks
2.0,Fits great but unless you have no curves doesn't look very appealing. Nothing like what it looks like on the model
2.0,I thought these would be like the mirror glasses that you can still see through them.  Not so.  These basically have a not-so-see-through sticker over the lenses.  Don't expect to get a good look at anything while wearing these.
2.0,"These were much smaller and less impressive that we thought they would be.  BUT, they were cheap and arrived on time."
2.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful wallet but the pull strap doesn‚Äôt do anything.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs defective or not.
2.0,Bottoms are way too small!! Order the top at least two sizes up.
2.0,This is a fashion mask not for protection
2.0,"Came in a knot. Have never worn, can‚Äôt get untangled. Not worth returning"
2.0,"The purse itself is fine--but I don't like the strap.  It's too heavy for the purse.  Also, the purse liner is too dark.  You can't see anything in it and the pockets are too shallow."
2.0,I ordered a 3xl per review indicates to order a size up. I am 5'9 220lbs. This item still fit snug and the material is cheap.  I decided to keep to wear around the house during this quarantine. I will not being wearing this jumper outside the house.
2.0,"Not for big people. It actually did pretty well, when it stayed on. The buckle slipped. Head I‚Äôve been able to find all the pieces including the little loop of elastic to hold the excess belt in place, I would have returned this product. Unfortunately I lost that little loop of elastic.<br />As a current big guy, the metal buckle would dig into my belly. So that when I took it off I had a nice impression that would last‚Äînot very comfortable. I could tolerate that especially with adjusting my jeans to accommodate. What I could not tolerate is the fact that as I would move or just go throughout my day the belt would get loose and my pants would start falling down. Not a good thing for a belt. I did not want to resort to using duct tape to hold it in place. I think that defeats the purpose of having a belt that you think looks cool.<br /><br />The buckle design is awesome. The concept is awesome. Set the belt where you want, then all you have to do is clip it on and clip it off. If only it would stay set where you need it."
2.0,The sizes are two sizes too small!
2.0,Did not stay on well...
2.0,"Please note that these are not ""American"" sizing; the pair I received were oversized and much too long (well below my knees).  The material does not seem to be high cotton content as described, and the care tag says ""Professional Dry Cleaning Recommended.""  Um, no.  I won't be sending knock-around shorts to the cleaners.  The waistband is wide and comfortable, but these are made for tall individuals.  My quest for comfortable COTTON KNIT shorts continues."
2.0,These are so comfortable and stretchy. They are well made and fit beautifully. The problem is that they run when washed so beware. I'm very disappointed but since I live outside of the US it's not worth the trouble to return.
2.0,It was European size
2.0,Loved my new watch band. Love the brown sand color. Super easy to install. The band has unlatched over three times while sitting on my recliner watching TV. I kept putting it back on but keeps coming off. I will put my original garmin band back on. I would hate to lose a new smart ‚Äãwatch over a weak band. I had no choice but to return it.
2.0,PU leather means &#34;not leather.&#34;  Thought I was getting quality. Not
2.0,Very small bag. Bag won't zip up all the way closed with a 15&#34; laptop.
2.0,the quality of this item is great. but it is too small even for the credit card and i.d. . i had to buy another wallet.i dont use this one.
2.0,"I went against my better judgment and ordered these pants because they were just so cute, but all the reviews saying they fit weird are 100% correct. I ordered a large, and they might as well have been a small. I am a size 6, and while these technically fit, the waistband (which is elastic) was too loose, and I could barely move my thighs. When I sat down in them, the waistband bunched up and made it look like an extra stomach or something. Just a very weird fit overall, I don't recommend these pants unless you have VERY skinny thighs. I will be returning them and not reordering."
2.0,see through and came with a really bad chemical smell.
2.0,I thought the pocket to hold crystal would be bigger and i‚Äôm very disappointed. it can hold my very  small crystals but nothing like the pictures
2.0,Wore them twice and they already got a huge whole in them. The sewing isn‚Äôt very good on these at all. Super disappointed
2.0,When I put it on....it looks like a wedding dress.  Definitely looks different in the picture.<br />Only wore it once.
2.0,Is was smaller for me. I can barely fix my head. Is pretty.
2.0,"I really like these bracelets and would give a 5 star review,  however I only received 29 in my order and needed 30 for the party head count. üòî"
2.0,"The material isn't very good quality. It's quite thin and looks pretty cheaply made. That being said, i didn't give it 1 star only because it didn't cost much."
2.0,Cute little set just way to small. Medium is like a xs order 2 or 3 sizes up
2.0,"I ordered a medium as I typically do, but it was very short in the torso. The bottom sunflower fabric was very thin and translucent. You‚Äôd have to wear something underneath it. The top part was not flattering at all and the elastic in it seemed a little stretched out."
2.0,Too small and not for tall people.
2.0,"I was super excited for these leggings, but found them to be too baggy. For reference, I'm 5'3'' and around 120ish pounds. I weight train and am not a skinny girl but these leggings were way too baggy around the crotch/ waist area so I couldn't run, sprint, jump or squat properly without having to pull em back up.<br /><br />Wont be ordering again :/"
2.0,Size is deceiving these gloves only come up as far as where ones hand joins the wrist. I have small hands and these gloves do not cover the wrist as shown in the Amazon photo.  Otherwise these gloves will serve the purpose but they are not long whatsoever
2.0,The photo looks like a longer loose sweater. I ordered the xxl and found it to run short. Sleeves were tight. Disappointed that it didn‚Äôt look like the photo
2.0,Glasses work as expected - blocks out screen lights but very small. I know that every kid is different but the glasses seem tiny for a 3 or 4 year old face.
2.0,"This is one of many Diesel watches I own. It is the most expensive of my collection and despite the fact I love it, waited for some time to purchase it, and finally it was a gift from my wife, I find it to be one of the least of my collection."
2.0,"Ok. It's a memento, but the plastic overlayment of the Pats logo and the LI with the Lombardi significantly dull the legibility, and detracts from its appeal. So much so that I am pretty certain that the image they use in the listing could not have been taken with it on.  Won't send it back, because this outfit charges nearly $5 for shipping, ... it's not Amazon Prime eligible, ... but certainly wouldn't recommend in all events. Save your money."
2.0,"Somehow I expected better quality.  I purchased XLarge it's a bit too tight, however I'll use it as incentive to try to lose some inches as well as weight.  We'll see what happens.  Or, I may decide to return it.  Funny thing though it arrived on Sunday and was delivered.  I didn't know that we, (the Postal Service) delivered on Sunday unless it is Express.  I'm a recent retiree of USPS."
2.0,"One of the friction buckles was installed backwards so it would not hold tight - the end was sewn on so I guess I could have cut-off and just flipped the buckle, but I didn't have much length left. I'd try something else..."
2.0,"Was hoping to hold somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 to 3,000 cash and the magnet would not work at all with the thickness.  Sure it would work better for others, but not for a fat wad."
2.0,The pants are as soft as plastic bag
2.0,"The material is thin, but soft. The buttons are fake. The tie at the waist is fake."
2.0,Seems like an amazing coat. Came in the timeframe as expected but unfortunately the zipper was missing a tooth so unfortunately I cannot zip up the coat which results in requesting a refund! Buy at your own risk!!
2.0,Order a size (or 2) down. It runs really big!
2.0,Cute top except the arm strings that cross cross just hang down.  They don‚Äôt look cute and lay flat like in the picture.  I returned it.
2.0,The pattern for the skirt is super cute in itself!  I'm giving the two stars based on that alone.  The dress is advertised as a swing dress.  I was so sad when I put it on and found that it was not a swing dress at all üò©  And the top is a little too see through..  I will have to wear something under the dress. Not what I was going for..
2.0,Smaller and less quality than shown
2.0,Painful to wear after 10 minutes
2.0,We bought a small given their size range and it almost fits me! They are much bigger than suggested and stated. He will be able to grow into it literally in a couple of years :-(
2.0,"I loved the style of this top, but the fit was terrible. Sadly, this isn't the top for a busty gal and it had to go back. No problems returning it, though!"
2.0,These nose rings are very pretty but the color on them actually flakes off so I would never buy these again or recommend them to anyone
2.0,"For this price I really expected this item to be heavy cotton or linen. It's not. It is polyester (man-made, plastic like thread). It will be uncomfortable to wear and hot-- unless it's cold outside and then it will be cold. It is cheaply made with many creases from folding. Will take some steaming to get those creases out. If you just need this for something quick-- it's okay. But I wanted it for a play and it just looks cheap and fake."
2.0,We received one sock
2.0,The point of buying this was to make my stomach center and my butt bigger.  It did a good job at sucking me in  but the length was too short and of the padding was barely there on my butt  which hung out anyway.  Need to be resized for taller people.
2.0,"Sleeves are cotton but torso is a very thin, see-through polyester. Will not buy again."
2.0,The ring itself is really pretty but it broke after wearing it for about 2 days. Typical poorly made belly button ring.
2.0,"Very difficult to clip on my glasses. Because it was so difficult a len came out of my glasses. Also, part of the protective rubber broke off on one side. I will probably return these glasses."
2.0,"Size was right, but shaft was too tight to ""pull-on"". Had to return."
2.0,"Ladies if you have cellulite pass this dress up unless you'll be wearing a spanx but its to fitted for a spanx personally! Lol. The material is thin, trust me. Very cute dress but not so good material. It will not, I repeat it will not hide the dents. LOL"
2.0,"These are pretty see through, not thick at all. Expect to wear something under them or be comfortable with people seeing your bra. Fine to work out in, but not to really wear in public"
2.0,"Order size 16, short tag said 16, but they were cut to a size 12 maybe. Too much trouble to return so gave them to a local title 1 school."
2.0,"I ordered according to the sizing chart and these pants were far too tight for me. I measured the length and they were not a true 32&#34; inseam, a little under 31&#34;. The fabric was also not good quality. I wouldn't wear these to work."
2.0,"Pretty dress but way too small. My daughter is 9, average size. I ordered the size they recommended which was 9-10yr old, absolutely too small!! This size should have been for a 5-6 yr old."
2.0,The shade part keeps falling off the glasses.  They do not clip on and stay.  I would not buy again.
2.0,"In agreement with the others, this material is sooooo thin and has no body at all. The bib is out of proportion and it does wrinkle like crazy!<br /><br />Needed for a specific event and hope it lasts the day - do not recommend!"
2.0,Very cheap material. No like
2.0,I dislike this product immensely. Warning when removing you will also be removing delicate skin on your nipples. Very chaffing
2.0,I bought these for a very good friend of mine and the waist was too small. Is it possible for me to exchange them for a different size? Or return them after she tried to wear them.
2.0,"Poor quality, not lined, buttons flimsy and cheap. I sent it back"
2.0,"The color is wonderful but it just did not fit well. Granted it is a flowy design, the dress hung in an unflattering way - the cut is simply not constructed successfully."
2.0,"I bought the set order, which came with two shades.<br /><br />One came in all damaged as if it was an old return item. The packaging wasn't damaged at all so I was surprised when I saw the rims all damaged with scratches on it.  (See close up pics)<br /><br />Two stars because the second one looks new and is not damaged and fits like a charm. (see the pic with overall shade view)<br /><br />However, after seeing the first glasses will not recommend."
2.0,Item was more like a xlarge not medium
2.0,"I've taken one trip with this bag at it's already damaged. The logo on the front was ripped off, there are small tears in a couple of places and there is all this black markings on it that I can't get off. It is lightweight and big and I do like the cushy handle."
2.0,Strings hanging everywhere.  Will not be giving as stocking stuffer for Christmas.
2.0,I got the biggest size and way to small for a C cup. Otherwise super cute and stylish
2.0,way too small. sleeves are made of thin tulle. Thinner then cheap dollar store tulle. Will need to completely reconstruct and resew this and its not even worth the effort. disappointed
2.0,"Received a medium when I ordered a size small. (Rechecked my order details - and I definitely ordered the correct size.) Pants seem great, but I'm super disappointed that they are too large."
2.0,"It‚Äôs just a polyester shell, so you may get away with ‚Äúwater resistant‚Äù but ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù is flat out misleading.  Update the product description to be truthful!<br />It also clearly says hand wash only on the label, not machine wash.  It‚Äôs very thin, probably worth it for $20."
2.0,I thought I was ordering the same Russell mesh shorts like I had been ordering. However when I put them on they were cut a bit skimpy and had NO pockets like the other 7 pairs I have bought.<br /><br />I was surprised and not happy. However it is not worth the hassle to ship them back. I will buy these two colors from the right company with pockets when my Social Security check comes in next month.
2.0,I love how these look in person.  The only thing wrong with them is they do not have a good clasp on them. You could lose them at any time. If they'd fix they that be perfect!
2.0,"Seems like this is a knockoff, from the gaudy gold color to the cheap seeming bag it came it. I‚Äôm doubtful that it is authentic Brighton."
2.0,The product came with two of the same ear. Would have been really cute otherwise.
2.0,"Returned these because the straps were weird, they looked cheap and the holes weren‚Äôt fully punched through the leather strap so I had to improvise and make my own hole in one of the straps. Also very very tall, considering the height they aren‚Äôt too hard to walk in but I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to wear these out."
2.0,"Was looking for a durable train whistle. This is a whistle, but has nothing to do with trains or conductors."
2.0,"I really liked the style of these glasses but they were so big that they would not even stay on my face. SO‚Ä¶ Women, especially women with a small face, cannot wear these"
2.0,I was under the impression (I am sure it was my fault ) that these socks were for diabetics. Which to me means they are loose. These are compression socks. They fit very tight. I returned them as I would never wear them.
2.0,INSTRUCTIONS on tag say do NOT MACHINE DRY.<br />I would NOT a have bought it.<br />All my sleepwear and robes get washed and dried!!!
2.0,Before purchasing I made sure to read the reviews so I ended up ordering a large turns out it was way too big and unflattering from the top and it fit perfect from the waist down
2.0,These photos make the shirt look distressed or vintage looking which was the look I was going for. That is not the case.
2.0,"Cheap, but will fulfils its use. I use it when working on ships. If you are using it for events I do not recommend it, as it builds up condensation, and the compass is questionable. All in all - worth the price."
2.0,They won't let me post my true review so I'll water it down. No zipper. Pull over head and it gets difficult to get past chest. After you go through that it fits a bit snug in chest area if you are more plush in that area. Still nice. Keeping it. The shipping lowered it another star. Major headache.
2.0,"Typically I wear a 32A. I read in the product reviews that I should order up one size so I went with a 34B. The cup size is perfect but the band is extremely snug! The color is a bit off from the photo and the band is also quite a bit thicker than it appears. In order for the bra to actually provide some &#34;push up,&#34; I had to tighten the straps a bit. Doing so made the band visible with almost every top that I had hoped to wear it with.... It comes up so high when tightened that it rubs my underarms raw after about 30 minutes (and no, I didn't have it tightened to the max, it was only about an inch tighter--still the band nearly covers my entire rib cage). I literally couldn't wait to take it off! It does give my itty bitties a great shape and, although the band is super tight, it's thickness is great for hiding all back and side bulging. There are good and bad qualities about this bra.... I don't think I'd recommend it though, as I've never had a problem wearing other push-ups all day long that have provided the same shape benefits that this one did."
2.0,I'm short but curvy. These stay up (most of the time) but they are not made for short women. These go ALL THE WAY up my leg. They're practically pants.
2.0,Got all scratched up and I don‚Äôt even know how.  Got a different Zelda ring that won‚Äôt get all scratched up.  Really disappointed with the quality.
2.0,"I had to return these, my fingers got cold. No protection from cold weather."
2.0,"Good quality, but had to give them to my mom, who wears a whole size smaller than I do! They run wayyyy small. I was bummed, bc I really needed them at the time."
2.0,Pins are ok. the band is not of high quality
2.0,Muy delgado no te sirve para fr√≠o no lo recomiendo solo de vista y para la foto
2.0,I loved the graphics and design of the helmet. I bought the helmet brand new from amazon but ended up returning it due to a large scratch on the modular visor. It was brand new so I'm not sure how it got there. I was pretty bummed I had to send it back.
2.0,"Cute, simple bag. Unfortunately, one of the straps broke only after two months of use."
2.0,"Well, it's a sea turtle, not a tortoise. Cute if you like sea turtles."
2.0,It broke after jus a few days.
2.0,Put the shirt on once and it has a huge hole in it !!!
2.0,Ugh. I wanted this to be super cute but I kind of hate it. The material is stiff and scratchy and as you can see it's very sheer. If I were actually going to wear these pants I would have to completely cut out the pockets and then wear white or nude underneath but even then I'm afraid it would show. I'm just not a fan.
2.0,"Was a bit disappointed with this product. While the company did a great job getting it here on time, the item itself was lacking. It was much smaller than i expected. In fact so small its hard to read the inscription. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,Way too small and made with material that was too thin -- returned without difficulty.
2.0,"What a complete disappointment! The the material is very thin and very cheap looking! I ordered an XL even though I wear a medium, but after reading reviews that the size runs a little small, I thought that i'd order a larger size with the hopes that it fits, but still too small!!!"
2.0,"Small, dipper is huge and will scratch the crap out of you"
2.0,You get what you pay for - the quality is low and they are not very well made.
2.0,"I enjoyed the dress, but the first time and only time I wore the front of the dress begin to fade. The front part was the part to fade.<br />I think it was cheap material used."
2.0,"I am 5'3 1/2. My measurements are: 33, 32, 42. I'm 150 pounds and have too kids. I have a pretty athletic body with curves at my lower half. After ready reviews I chose this pink one in a medium. It was wayyyy too short on the torso and tight everywhere. The color was too pink like a little girls bathing suit. The ties at the bottom needed to be cut by the buyer but I didn't cut it because I am returning it. It wasn't even that stretchy. Felt stuffed in it. My lady part felt really squished. Wouldn't recommend unless you're tiny and have a short torso. My husband likes everything on me but he said this wasn't flattering. Overall the tightness was uncomfortable. Maybe a size up will be better if it wasn't for the short torso and pink color."
2.0,I ordered the dress in navy for a wedding. The dress is completely seethrough and is extremely short. Don‚Äôt recommend. P.S. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 for reference.
2.0,"After the first washing, the letters already started peeling away. The shirt is not soft at all. It was very unfortunate. I was going to recommend this shirt to my department, because it's a cute design and saying: however, it's not worth it to buy. I was really disappointed overall."
2.0,Poor quality. The price doesn‚Äôt match the expectation. The fabric is not wool or very low portion of it. Very cheap material.
2.0,They are pretty but too long.
2.0,These are extremely thin gloves and tear way too easy
2.0,"These are beautiful but they are very small. The way they are designed makes them appear to hang off the bottom of your earlobe rather than from the center, almost as if you just clipped them to just the very bottom of your lobe. I didn‚Äôt like the look.<br /><br />Because they are small, it‚Äôs hard to distinguish the rose gold from the jewels. If you are looking for something very subtle and elegant and the bottom-of-the-lobe look doesn‚Äôt bother you, these might be for you.<br /><br />They do appear to be well-made and the earring-backs go on with a screwing motion so you know they aren‚Äôt going to fall off."
2.0,large and snags on everything
2.0,You have to get really close to even read it.  I ordered it thinking it would be a decent size it is Uber small.
2.0,"Daughter really likes these but beware, the stitching is defective. The heel came off after only a week. We were refunded and then I was able to glue it down."
2.0,Material not the same as the last ones I bought
2.0,"It fits fine but the mask is noticeably darker on one side. I know that the photo in the description shows a slightly shadow, but the one corner is completely black."
2.0,"This item was a complete fail.  The bottoms were fine, but the top‚Ä¶.. oh the top!  It has no shape to it and the straps were extremely too long (big)!  There is no way to make any adjustments to it either.  I LOVED the color but I will not be able to wear this.  I‚Äôm so disappointed!"
2.0,"Advertised as pink, but it‚Äôs actually an ugly orange üòê"
2.0,"You definitely need to size down. Still very oversized. But this fabric is awful. It has ZERO stretch. Since it‚Äôs oversized and boxy the sleeves and longer and drop lower, but then you‚Äôre basically trapped in a straight jacket and can‚Äôt move your arms because the material has no give."
2.0,"I have a pair of these in green and absolutely LOVE them. I get lots of compliments on them and they are very comfortable. Was looking for a pair of brown ones and ordered these. When they arrived, I noticed that the color looked very orange. Although they fit well and were comfy, I did not like the color at all and returned them."
2.0,"I was so excited to try this dress but it's way too big on me. I'm pretty small, 5'0 and 100 lbs so this dress was super baggy on the butt and too loose and long at the bottom. It was very nice material though! I would recommend it to others but not if your little like me."
2.0,It's not a real leather
2.0,Overall the quality of this jacket is very low. Zipper is junk and the material feels very plastic. Love the design but not enough to keep the jacket.<br /><br />Not for skiing!
2.0,These served the purpose
2.0,Should looked at the stars this hat is cheap and the logo will probably come off
2.0,kinda big and the rubber on the heel that makes it no slip is so tiny actually kinda worthless- i should have returned but i wore a pair
2.0,"The glasses were really nice, but entirely too BIG !"
2.0,"Ordered for my son and the mask looks really cool. The bad thing is that the back of the mask tore the first day. There was a small tear in it, maybe defect? If the tear hadn't been there, then it would have been a great mask!"
2.0,The band is beautiful. However I could not find a good fit by removing links. Also it is almost impossible to navigate on the touch screen with the protector part on.
2.0,"Super cute but runs WAY small. If you have boobs, pass this one by. If you are on the lean side, you'll love it. I scored low because the size chart should be accurate when selling on line"
2.0,totally you get what you pay for. Sizes run way too small.
2.0,Did not like the quality of the material.
2.0,"The material is awful. It feels like being wrapped in a plastic blanket. The belt doesn't stay tied well either. My solution is to wear a black cotton slip underneath. I wore the dress with no slip once and broke out in a horrible heat rash all over my back and shoulders. It looks really cute on but obviously, quality control was back shelved in favor of fast profit. I've bought a lot of stuff from Allegra K but this one is just not my favorite."
2.0,"This product fits snuggly-runs small.  Love the color and texture, though."
2.0,These are ok. They are kind of think and lumpy...
2.0,Don't fit my glasses they were purchased for.
2.0,"The actual sewing pattern must be compromised, the cut and lines are &#34;off&#34;.  The swim suit is cut wrong, the area for the breast above the circle the material hangs too low, the pattern is probably a copy of a copy of a copy."
2.0,I have lymphedema with sensitive skin. First off even going by my measurements I should have had plenty of room. They were so hard to get on and the fabric was so rough i skinned my finger pulling them up. Secondly as soon as I walked in the kitchen for a bandaid I had to much material bunch around my ankle. It was to painful I had to take it right back off. I should have had an over inch of extra room according to the measurement guidelines and it was a complete workout getting them on.
2.0,"They are super cute, but your nipples have to be tiny to wear them. Just are too small."
2.0,It had a slight blemish on it other than that my grandmother loved it
2.0,Earrings broke in 3 weeks
2.0,The drape of the fabric is nice but the neck line cross cross is way to long on one side so it sags down. The white fabric is also see through.
2.0,Bag is not as big as expected. It is a small tote at best. Definitely not large in size.
2.0,Unfortunately I had to send this product back. It had what appeared to be a black burn mark from the application of the screen press.
2.0,White is extremely see through.
2.0,"Price - very inexpensive, fabric - nice, quality of sewing - not bad for the price....sizing - awful."
2.0,Quite a few of the class pieces don‚Äôt align and cannot be closed I think I have approximately a third or a fourth Of my cages that cannot be used.
2.0,Bought it when my daughter was about 8 months old and now is 12 and it is still super huge. Very cute but sizes are off a bit
2.0,"About 2 sizes too small.  I wear a large, and when I opened it I thought it might fit- forty years ago.  The quality is pretty good, but it's difficult to assess when you don't have a Ken Doll close at hand to try the jacket for you."
2.0,Ordered an XL since I normally wear Medium/Large...still entirely too small.  Had to return them sadly.
2.0,These do not son the ear as expected.
2.0,It runs really large and is not very flattering on shorter body types.
2.0,The stones were not glued in correctly and one is set almost on top of another and it makes it look as if there are missing stones. For the price I guess I should expect poor quality.
2.0,split on a seam after the first wear.  Re sewed for my grand daughter and it split again...just kind of shreds so without surging all the seams yourself don't expect it to last very long.  Still cute though if just for a one time wear!
2.0,Delivery time was great and the hat fits great but is lopsided. It is so bad I will never wear it
2.0,"The description is very misleading. This material is by no means sweatshirt. It is very<br />lightweight T shirt at best.  It looks good, but don't expect it to be thick or warm"
2.0,Cheaply made. Image is wrinkled probualy do to bent during shipping
2.0,Don't expect to get what you ordered. Feeling sad because I liked the Army green with pink but mine is my pink at all. Just be prepared. Trying to decide whether to return. Hate the hassle of returns but not at all pleased with the bag that I got. Would not have ordered this color combo.
2.0,Runs small no push up just underwire
2.0,These are high waisted and a lot tighter than I expected and I even sized up. The material is thinner which I loved and they quality was nice. I'm 5'4 and they were plenty long. Still returning.
2.0,"We loved the quality of the uniform; however, followed the advice of the item that says outfit runs large and to get one size smaller.. We did that and its very tight. :("
2.0,Definitely a cute mask. Not made very well.
2.0,"Today I am writing 4 reviews for Adhesive Bras and this one is my least favorite.  While the material is smooth, the cup itself is huge compared to others in this catagory.  It covered way too much area.  Also, when placing the non-adhesive circles where they belong, the bra did not provide the same cleavage as other adhesive bras.<br /><br />Hopefully this will save you some legwork and return hassles.  I am also going to review the Pinky Pedals (5 stars) Tidetell Wing (4 stars), and Tidetell Double Thick (2 stars)."
2.0,"Not Chunky, very small"
2.0,"Honestly not what I was expecting, first of all there too short, and if they were the right size, I could only wear them to maybe a party, or an event, not for work or casual wear. I'm still keeping them because they fit my son,  6 years old."
2.0,Burn ears
2.0,ummm it didnt do anything!!! My arms still look fat and gross.
2.0,The back was put on wrong. 20 was the Jelly and the 17 was the peanut butter. That was my only issue.
2.0,"The necklace is pretty, but the chain is NOT 18 inches."
2.0,"Leaves a very odd and noticeable profile. It sticks to skin so during normal movement, it shifts things around uncomfortably."
2.0,I really liked the shape and fit of it. But I dislike. The material. I washed it carefully and with like colors but it has little fuzzies on it. And my pockets have holes. This would be great in a different material.
2.0,Cute band. I‚Äôve had this for 4 months and the band is cracking/peeling.
2.0,The earring was broken.
2.0,"No vienen contramarcada con la palabra &#34; polarized&#34; tal como lo muestra la foto , y los vidrios no son polarizados"
2.0,"I Really like the feel of the product, and they are a nice slim fit with some give. The pocket is a nice touch especially when I take my baby for a walk in the stroller - I don‚Äôt have to worry about holding my phone to log my steps! I got warm very fast working out in them tho - significantly warmer than other pants which is strange, but overall a good purchase<br /><br />**edited 10/14 - I ordered three pairs of these. When I opened the second and tried them on, there was a hole along the seam of the leg. Sending them back today for an exchange but hopefully don‚Äôt have the same problem with the next pair"
2.0,Outfit ran very small
2.0,"Flat, shapeless and doesn't look the same color as in the picture. It also sheds like crazy and the bun had to be reset since it was nearly falling off. Very disappointing."
2.0,Shrinks.  Got 3 sizes larger because of reviews so it fits but way way too short.
2.0,Very short and small
2.0,Not worth the value paid for
2.0,Much tighter than expected and my skull is not Neanderthal size.  Good material and snap back to size but I had to take 3 stars off for the circumference.  They are basically useless to me unless I want to use them for my bicep or as an sexual longevity aid!
2.0,"The plastic is too thin and flexible, they just bend when you put any weight on them so the bra straps fall right out."
2.0,Thanks to the reviews I wear a Small but bought a XXL and it fits perfectly. So basically think of it as if you are buying clothes for a toddler.
2.0,"I have a small foot so I'm not worried about the fit, they are a bit tighter than the traditional athletic sock, but the design is great and shipping was great. Price was also great. Great great great. :)  Retract previous. They are like putting on a toddlers sock. Booo!"
2.0,"I have yet to try this on but just looking at it, I can clearly see it isn't cut right. There is no clear outline that shows top or bottom and on top of that it's two pieces. The item is listed as a dress not a corset and skirt."
2.0,I've been seeing a trend for these but I can't say I can pull them off. They looked like space boots and you'd have to have a pretty niche style to wear them. They might look better if they were more of a cream color. They fit correctly HOWEVER the toe end of the boot was really tight making them uncomfortable so I wrote that they run a bit small.
2.0,"Too small,  even for kids,  don't stay on ear."
2.0,Too small to be 16g
2.0,They fit good but quality of of lense holding up. Started seeing faded spots and it's only been a month and a half.
2.0,The shirt was wet when I took it out of the package and smelled really bad
2.0,I thought it came with monofin. Disappointed me. Not recommended unless for costume party
2.0,"Fit smaller than the other two I purchased at the same time, shredded shortly after the return window was closed.  Material seemed thinner than previous ones I purchased."
2.0,Quality is bad runs very small
2.0,"Somehow on my first trip with these the tag got bent and then fell off.  They look great, the design is good, but all metal leaves them vulnerable."
2.0,There are two issues with this product.  The first and most problematic is the black dye used for these comes off on your pillow and is unremovable once there.  That alone is a deal breaker.  The second issue is it's seamed around the edges and over a short period of time it starts to come apart exposing the foam that is under the outer material.  I'm guessing they made it that way intentionally so they could sell more.<br /><br />I won't buy these again and will search for a better made product.
2.0,"I have this same ring in stainless finish, I love it. Decided to buy this black ring. It broke within a month of use."
2.0,"Was thinking this would be handy addition but its more trouble than its worth. Can't leave it on umbrella post when you dismantle it. Have to slide it on after opening umbrella, while dealing with beach winds. Just awkward.  A clip on design would be easier to assemble on beach."
2.0,It is thin and sheer it it‚Äôs a lot shorter than expected from the picture honestly it looks like they found a picture online and tried to make a shirt similar.
2.0,It does not look like in the picture at all.
2.0,There cheap looking and feeling
2.0,"The necklaces I recieved aren't the same as pictured. Please see below. Also, all of these necklaces are the same exact size.. not what I was expecting when it said you could layer them. They aren't layerable if they are the same size. The one necklace that is longer is only slightly longer (as pictured). Annoyed because I thought I would be getting necklaces of different sizes for layering."
2.0,Very disappointed. Cute and good quality but multiple sizes too small. I ordered it oversized and it doesn‚Äôt even fit me normally. It‚Äôs like a medium. They also cut the tag where the size should be so that says a lot. Never again:/
2.0,The gloves are cute but does not keep your hands warm.
2.0,"Looks like a cheap hat, not a 22$ hat."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this jacket.  It came a lot lighter in color than it was presented in the pictures.  I was ok with that as I really wanted a brown leather jacket.  Shortly after purchase with gentle wear, it started to peel and scratched very easily.  Despite using protestants, it continued to peel and lose its brown coloring.  So sad as I am now stuck with a coat that I don't feelgood about wearing."
2.0,All 3 are a bit different in size. 1 pair there is a hole in the butt seam. They are comfortable. Would not purchase again.
2.0,"The shoes are beautiful but unfortunately it is not built to last at all. The sole of the shoes detached, so I went o get it repair and it happen again! The look is amazing but the quality is garbage, I wish they will make this exact style with good materials. Please dont even bother to buy them to find out, you will thank me!"
2.0,Runs large but decent quality
2.0,"Beautiful dress, but way too small. Had to return it."
2.0,Snap is glued velcro so I had to buy a cheap snap from Michael's but works well now
2.0,I had high hopes for these stays/garters but they failed to deliver on those hopes.  I liked that the plastic grips allowed me to go through TSA inspections with less metal on me but then one of the plastic grips broke on only my third time using them.  I was even willing to look past the fact that they were a little more difficult to use because the grip tended to close just as you are about to put the shirt or sock material in them and it required several tries each time to insert the material before the grip would close.  I am going to stick with the metal grips and keep my fingers crossed when going through the TSA checks.
2.0,Fit was wierd on my body - not sure how. I gave it to my sister who is a little bigger and it looked great on her.
2.0,The top is a little to big and the bottoms are so big they can't even fit a six year old and I ordered it for my 2 years old. The underwear waist is just right but the butt area is way to big.
2.0,This top hung oddly...puckered where the cutout sleeves connected with the rest of the sweater.... I gave it away.
2.0,Not true to size.  Did not go to ankle and was way to tight.  I had return.
2.0,What a piece of trash. It says &#34;jacket&#34;. It's a hefty bag with a zipper
2.0,"Too big. Thin material. Colors are very nice & vibrant. I suggest sizing down. I'm 5'7"" 215 and ordered a XXL. I could probably wear a L or even M. Returned."
2.0,Screw came out after just trying on twice. Replacement screws they sell in state don't work. Will be returning.
2.0,I wish it was smaller
2.0,very unflattering...the fabric is too thick to be swingy and the waistband is ucomfortable. The pleated front does not lie nicely. Should have sent it back but not worth the effort.
2.0,I have a small upper body and usually a L fits me. I did read that these tops run small so I ordered a 2x.  Unfortunately  even a 2x was too small.
2.0,"Very tight in chest, rest had great fit."
2.0,Great quality material but the snaps are falling out.
2.0,"the main picture shows wings that are large but then has a picture with the dimensions which are much more accurate. the name of the item says kid adult costume. very contradictory. the wings can barely be seen behind the person wearing them they‚Äôre so tiny. Also, putting christmas in the name? like what?"
2.0,Top fits good and bottoms run like two sizes small
2.0,Very pretty but also very small.... As though to be used for a toddler
2.0,Didn't fit at all.  Ordered xxl and that is what I usually wear.  It was way smaller.  So runs small ladies!
2.0,"It is not was I expected, I thought that it would be a bit heavier and tighter in the weave."
2.0,Ordered a large but its probably designed for a woman with a short mid section cause it barely covers the belly button. I haven't even worn it yet. But for the price I guess its worth it. Ill probably give it as a gift for Xmas to a girl with a short mid section .
2.0,did not work.
2.0,"I followed the size chart but this was too small for me. The part that was too small was the band. It was extremely tight and stiff, not any stretch to it."
2.0,"The glasses themselves are really cute but the width of them is massive. I'm not sure how big other people's heads are, but they fall down and off my face constantly."
2.0,"Too big, it doesn‚Äôt look size 5"
2.0,Bought them for my daughter and me. They fall off our face. They are too big. Legs are too far apart.
2.0,Not what I thought they'd be. Fake wallet chain. Strange material. Unflattering af.
2.0,I am short and thick. I wanted to like this dress but It‚Äôs awkward. It is too too long and too too big. I had to scrunch it up to make it feel comfortable. It has some straps on the side that feel like they dont belong. Way too Long!!! Way too BIG! I am starting to wonder why I purchased such a huge dress for no reason. The tie knot on the front doesn‚Äôt cover anything and my bra was showing the entire time. I really wanted to like it but it was such a disappointment I only wore it for the brunch and took it off right away. If I can get a smaller size that would be great but i no longer even need it.
2.0,Very thin material and not well made  Wishing I had returned it the next day.
2.0,The fabric was a cheap rayon / polyester it was not cotton  it was just not  cute like the picture showed<br />And it was too big
2.0,"They were much bigger than I'd like them to be. If you like huge glasses, you'll like these. Gave them to my neice. Good price. Made well."
2.0,Now very good quality.  Clasp won't stay closed
2.0,"The ring itself is beautiful and exactly what I was wanting, however the band doesn't connect completely (end to end) right behind the ring so it scratches my finger when I take it on and off."
2.0,Material very odd. Did not work for my granddaughter at all
2.0,"I bought these for my son and daughter half way through the season. The shoes never had good grip so I wish my wife would have chosen the Nike's or Adidas I wanted to get them. Otherwise, good fit for both they'll just use them for school shoes."
2.0,"I ordered this for a job interview and I was not satisfied at all. I'm a plus size woman and I ordered a 2X. I felt like it just hung on me, not form fitting at all. Also had a tear in the shoulder."
2.0,"Cute, but charms broke off within a few days!"
2.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful dress. Good quality. Nice fabric. However it didn‚Äôt sit on my body right. It showed every part of my body I‚Äôm insecure about. Even with shapewear it didn‚Äôt look right on me.
2.0,"One size does NOT fit all.  Unless you are very skinny, it won't go around you.  I kept it because I am kind of skinny and will wear it unbuttoned most of the time.  Color is also off and more of a orangey yellow than buttercup."
2.0,"Ordered my 1.5 yr old the green and blue. While they are gorgeous and look sturdy/comfy too, they are huge! I'm not sure even one size down is enough to make them fit, so frustrated. We live in Florida so endless summer, they should fit in a few months. But wow, sizing is way off the mark."
2.0,This blouse print is cute and feel good on the body. The body is a bit large.  The arms are stiff and the chest area stands out.  The sleeves cannot be rolled as it is too tight.  I live in Asia so return shipping is costly so that will not be an option for me.  What I may try is to cut off the sleeves to release the stiffness at the chest area and stitch it. Hope it works.
2.0,"shirt is ok. Material is fine, but the collar is weird. Doesn't look like the picture, looks very Asian."
2.0,Runs very small - must be based on a European sizing scale.  My 12 year old son who's not above average size couldn't fit
2.0,"This is a really cute shirt and I saw shirt because it is thin material, I always get compliments when I wear it however the elbow pads do not sit in the right place, I have to constantly adjust the elbow pads so they sit in somewhat of the correct place. If the elbow pads were sewn in the correct spot it would be a much better shirt"
2.0,I personally have larger earlobes and these did not fit. it seemed as if they were made for children.
2.0,"This was so pretty I loved it at first. But after putting it on my wrist a couple of times, it was totally stretched out and started coming apart and you can‚Äôt form it ‚Äúback‚Äù.<br />I tried."
2.0,Far too loose for it to be the size I ordered.
2.0,Cute shorts but didn't fit right and the zipper broke after just trying them on.
2.0,The bust is absurdly disproportionate to the sizing of the dress: too small (if your busty).
2.0,It is a beautiful skirt but the size is way off.
2.0,I am 5'8&#34; 180lbs. I ordered and extra large hoping it would give me more room in the torso area. The only thing that was bigger were the arm holes. They were huge and gaping. The material was also poor quality and not worth the price.
2.0,I am surprised of the stellar reviews of these sunglasses. The glasses overall are very poorly made. It feels like the packaging of the glasses is worth more. I would be happier with better glasses and simpler packaging/case.
2.0,"not that i expected it to last forever at that price, but the chain broke the second time i wore it.  boo hiss."
2.0,"IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE SILK, RATHER CHEAP LOOKING AND TOOO THICK"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4b7418dd5a65e1253ccf2fb7b9470aa4]] Not a real Alexan ani but cute very small
2.0,"Product came with yellow stains, cheap material, and ‚Äúfilters‚Äù fold and slide right out because the pouch is not the right size for it. The print is really cute though which is why I didn‚Äôt give 1 star"
2.0,"Like the jacket, I. e.,sizing way to small. Ordered extremely large size and the jacket is still tight."
2.0,These sunglasses broke after a few days I‚Äôd wearing. Not well made. They look fine but will be looking for something with a bit more durability. They come with a soft micro fiber bag and hard case. After a few days the frames broke.
2.0,"This bag is what I was expecting, look wise. But, when I opened the package and pulled that bag out, it smelled like a dead rotten animal. I thought, at first, it must‚Äôve been the packaging mixed with the 100 degree weather. But then, I let the bag hang for several days and the smell would not leave. It even made the room it was in stink. I already have it packed up to return. Sad, it is a lovely bag for the price."
2.0,Pretty but way too small. Not the right sizing even after looking into the reviews and size chart. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
2.0,does not stay warm long enough and you cannot walk with them on your feet. Cools down quickly and are bulky
2.0,"The fit and style of this tunic is perfect! It is slimming and just the right length and so comfortable! There is one HUGE problem....after only one wearing and laundering ( delicate cycle - no dryer ) it has little balls all over to the point it is not wearable in public. Seriously.....do not buy this tunic unless it is to wear around the house or as pajamas. I bought two and it happened to both! When you first put it on you will love it and will not realize this is going to happen . Granted, it is very inexpensive, but one wear and it's pajamas. I wish they could make this exact tunic with a more durable fabric!"
2.0,"Made of a flimsy spandex that almost goes sheer when worn. If you have calves of any kind, avoid these tights. The waist also felt really loose. You get what you pay for, but these are pretty much unwearable. For the price and the fabric they are constructed well enough. The length was good though."
2.0,"more of a long sleeve shirt that sweatshirt. I was expecting more insulation & heftier fabric. the zipper is pretty cheap, & not easily adjusted. Was bigger than I expected as well, but will likely use as an over shirt when the sun goes down or shady days this summer."
2.0,"The mask is too big for kid and too little for adults. I brought this for my 7 years old and it's way too big, and it's way to small for myself."
2.0,Product came on time but appeared to be used and then returned. No packaging. Dirty.
2.0,"Nicely packaged and seems like decent quality, but... what weirdly shaped lenses!  If my eyes were set on the sides of my head like in iguana, I would love them.  The lenses are quite far apart, and are shaped almost like a right triangles.  The inner corners of the lenses barely covered the inner corners of my eyes.  They are going back."
2.0,"smaller than stated size, very pretty"
2.0,To tight.
2.0,"The original description of this coat is as follows: VERGOODR Winter Warm Women's Plus Velvet Long Sleeve Slim Long Down Jacket with Hood (2XL, Black) - which I purchased. The CURRENT description has ASIAN SIZE in it - so buyer beware! The coat seems like it would be good for winter except it wasn't in USA sizes!!! If you wear a 12 in USA sizes then you'd better get the 2XL. #IJS"
2.0,Why is too smalla arering
2.0,It dont last. It's a waste of money.
2.0,Watch is beautiful but doesn‚Äôt keep tome
2.0,I‚Äôm Very disappointed this hurts my feet so bad. It‚Äôs not comfortable and it runs smaller then expected.
2.0,Too small to be a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù bag
2.0,"More like pajama fabric, very thin and a bit transparent.  Not what I would call yoga pants, nice lounge pants though.  Sizes run small"
2.0,10 out of the 40 did not work.  They were not packaged like I thought they would be and the quality is just plain cheap!  Very disappointed that I did not get 40 working finger lights!
2.0,I bought the biggest size and it just not what‚Äôs on the pictures. Would not recommend unfortunately
2.0,good shape but doesn't work at all<br />advise not to buy
2.0,"Very cheap material, by the time I took it out of the box the keychain was already in pieces!!! My daughter is very upset!"
2.0,"i got an extra extra large, i am a medium/large, to have something with flow. its too small. agh."
2.0,Way tooo small
2.0,"My main criticism is that I ordered as wide since I use an orthopaedic brace in one of my feet. So I always order Wide sizes... never this pair of shoes are so tight that I have to force them to fit and they just feel uncomfortable to the point that I don't use them, very dissapointed but I don't want to go to the hazzle of returning this pair of shoes. So it might work for some but for me their wide sizes are not wide enough."
2.0,When it came it seemed fine but before I even left the house the stitching between the legs was already coming undone (and it wasn't small by any means). It got me through the night but I can never wear it again. Would not recommend.
2.0,They said water proof but made out of knit
2.0,Way too big and was more like a regular Tshirt then the picture implies.
2.0,The material on this bralette is really thin and it doesn't do much. I wear it around the house to clean in but that's all it's good for.
2.0,Not flattering - returned.
2.0,material was not high quality -- too bad.
2.0,"Disappointed, my hand are cold just under 50 degrees at hwy speed on my bike. Touch screen not working on IPhone and my left hand struggle when inserting gloves looks like the interior lining already gave up after just few times. Not happy with the purchase!"
2.0,The umbrella I got can not open completely.
2.0,"These are basically see through, no way they are keeping anybody safe if you are buying them for the purpose of using them for a mask.  They make a super cute headband though if that‚Äôs what your looking for."
2.0,Falls apart easily. Guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Sad to say I had to return this. I am a size large typically and ordered a large.  I didnt even try it on because it looked like it would fit my 12 yr old. I guess I didnt read the reviews. In order for it to fit me I would need to order a xxl.
2.0,"I purchased these because my daughter is a pretty tough ball player and chases loose basketballs quite frequently. She needed extra knee protection. I was disappointed that these leggings ended up with a hole just below the knee pad after the first use. Additionally, the padding fell apart after the second use. I'm needing to replace them but I'm hesitant to purchase this product again."
2.0,It was too much fabric and over complicated. Couldn't figure what went where
2.0,Not exactly like photo..cute . But expected better quality
2.0,Not a good representation of Monet‚Äôs work. I really blurred picture. I can‚Äôt see the title. I was just looking for something different in a face mask. I hope this is truly the end of the pandemic distancing.
2.0,This was a very awkward piece of clothing.  It was not off the shoulder at all.  It was just a large neck that draped in a weird way.  The fabric was heavy and extremely polyester like.  I was hoping for it to look even just a little like the picture but that was not the case at all.
2.0,Quality was cheap and material was stiff. I‚Äôm
2.0,"I wear a 10, sent those back and got an 11, guess I should have ordered a 12 to get the right fit they run too small."
2.0,Everything seemed fine except my normal XL size was too large to wear.
2.0,"Was too large, very thin"
2.0,Unfortunately ran way too big for me in a large. Which I always wear.<br /><br />I‚Äôll use it as an bathing suit cover up.<br />Too bad ;(
2.0,"Soft inside but cheap material. Guess 14 bucks doesn't buy you good quality lol. I'm a size 6 normally but with slippers that have &#34;cushioned insides&#34; I've always gotten a size up and they fit perfect. Like target slip ons! Prime example:) but these you should order true to your size. I barely read any reviews so it could say that on someone's already! If you're a 6, get a 6. If you're a 5, get a 5. :)"
2.0,"Wanted to like it but it is way too large! I had to return it. Maybe it was just me but description of item isnt what I received. It probably would look good on others; on me, not."
2.0,Quality was not very great and sleeves length too long so returned it
2.0,The dress is not as expected.
2.0,"Too small, quality not high enough for the price"
2.0,"It‚Äôs very soft; comes vacuum sealed so no weird smell, but the red color bled on the white and is now pink and washing it doesn‚Äôt help; also runs small; bought a large, fits my 15 year old daughter better than myself"
2.0,Pretty colors but just didn‚Äôt fit/look right on my. Returned it
2.0,I bought it because it was supposed to be antifog but it still fogs up.Very unhappy.
2.0,Ordered a X-Large.<br />Inside the package was one pair of XXL and one pair L.<br />I guess if you average the two wrong sizes you get one pair of X-large.<br /><br />I like them but a two pack with BOTH the wrong size???<br /><br />stupid.
2.0,I usually wear L or XL. I ordered XL. It was so small and tight. I wouldn‚Äôt wear it around the house  Sent it back. Too bad because I love stretchy long dresses but this was just way off size.
2.0,"Too thin, light weight  see through T-shirt material. I wear a medium 10/12, ordered a large and it‚Äôs still to tight. Looks better in pic. I have this style dress and the material is thicker, looks better."
2.0,I only had the band for 3weeks and it's tarnishing already.
2.0,The necklace is very stiff and doesn't sit nicely.  The earrings are really sharp and jab you in the head.  I could only keep them on for as long as I needed and then I couldn't wait to remove them.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:9449432aaa4118f644b33c7fb474d94]]
2.0,I liked how the pjs feel but I ordered a 4x and they are more like booty shorts. I got them on but the top is a little too small. I would recommend them to someone who is smaller. I did not realize when I ordered them that they were from China. I think this is why the sizing is wrong. If they would have offered a 6x I believe they would have fit better.
2.0,Good quality only if you have an extremely tiny neck !! I'm not even plus size & no one in my family could fit them .
2.0,They keep falling off my glasses :-(
2.0,Dress came damaged. It was coming apart in the front. It was extremely cute but ran a little small so I would have needed to order a 2x which costs quite a bit more so I returned dress for a refund.
2.0,Not happy with this purchase at all. The outfit is just awful and fits even worse. I ordered a large when I usually wear a medium I should of ordered an XL the was this one is sized. The overall outfit is just awkward and very ugly. Nothing on it looks right once you get past the feathers flying up in your face that are loose. Very unattractive corset.
2.0,I‚Äôd thought they be a little bigger but it‚Äôs very small not for those with gauges!
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and these look like high waters on me. So disappointed because they‚Äôd be so cute otherwise
2.0,it looks cheap and doesn't fit well on my ear. It keeps falling to the side of my ear. so I haven't worn it yet.
2.0,"Terribly sorry, but returned these as soon as I got them. The stones are much smaller than expected."
2.0,I ordered 3 pairs of these for myself and granddaughters! The fabric in this pair is  different than the 2 other pairs! Don't like them!
2.0,"Stuff rubber, very poor quality clasp. I took a chance on this and lost.  Do not buy."
2.0,"for me the length was too short.  I'm a 51 year old woman, so it was too young for me."
2.0,"After only one wash the band around the chest is so twisted.  I spent close to 20 minutes trying to flatten it out and it is still bound up somehow in the back where the elastic must be attached to the suit. The only thing I have not tried was cutting open the band to see why it is still all tangled as I have twisted and manipulated the elastic so many different ways and it still won't lay flat. Really wouldn't like to cut a brand new suit. >:(<br />Other than the band issue it is a great suit and a great fit. Just annoyed at the strap after only wash. Suit is now useless since it's twisted and looks bad, even when stretched out and on."
2.0,"The nose pad was broken on mine when I took them out of the box. If yours aren't broken, these look sweet. Not super high quality, but worth the price."
2.0,"It's just something  I end up using for a sweaty workout under a my taekwondo uniform. But seriously, doesn't do what it claims to do."
2.0,"Picture shows 2 layers of tunic robes, but only 1 layer came and it is much shorter in the torso than the pictures show (barely below belt line and I am not an extremely long or fat person). I will need to find another tunic for this outfit, as the singular one I received is too small to be the only tunic for the outfit.<br />Pants fit about as advertised, though are a bit snug in the jibblies area. Go a size up if you're a dude.<br />Belt made of some cheap pleather, will have to find something better elsewhere."
2.0,It runs small so order next size up. Other then that it‚Äôs great!
2.0,"I bought these for my 9 year old for the coming school year. They were advertised as kid's masks, but they're full sized adult masks."
2.0,"The other reviews are accurate...the pilling on these is ridiculous. My 6 year old loves them though, so I just periodically use a fabric shaver on them."
2.0,I did not like this. It was not made well and I returned it.
2.0,"I usually wear x-small petite length in Jockey scrubs, but these are way too form fitting to be professional looking on me. I'm 5'3 with a 37in hip, and the thighs on these pants look like leggings on me. I'd wear them as yoga pants, but the back barely covers my rear end. It's a shame, because I love my other Jockey scrubs."
2.0,I ordered it twice for the size. The large was too large and the medium was too tight. It is inexpensive and I found the quality lacking.
2.0,"Too vivid a pink.  Also was looking for longer length.  Okay material.  Good for costume, limited wear, or kids skirt"
2.0,"I bought these goggles about 6 months ago. In the beginning they were awesome! Exactly what I needed for both me and my mom to swim laps. As of January, you can not go half of a lap without them completely fogging up and losing all visibility. Not sure what the point is anymore. Will be buying new ones from someone else."
2.0,This coat is much smaller than the size on the label.
2.0,The goggles are comfortable and seal well but the strap is too short.
2.0,We're scratched on arrival
2.0,Super thin fabric - almost see through in the sunlight. Wouldn't buy again
2.0,"The shirts have next to zero compression. I‚Äôm returning my purchase.<br />Not what I expected.<br />As a regular body form undershirt it‚Äôd be fine, but not if you‚Äôre looking for compression."
2.0,"Not true to size.  I ware a size 40 pants,  can fit into 38's but I prefer 40's for the loos fit,  with some types of pants/shorts I like to go a few sizes up just to make sure I have plenty of mobility.  So I went ahead and ordered these in size 42, the took over a week to get here and when they finally arrived,  looked nice,  just as pictured,  but fit like 36's,  I was barely able to button the shorts!  Not to mention having close to zero mobility! The bag they came in says 42, the tag on the inside says 42, but there is no way these are 42's!  Huge disappointment,  if it wasn't such a huge pain in the ass I would send them back!  But I guess when you buy products made in China,  you get what you pay for.  If your a small person or very thin,  these would prob work out great for you,  but if you have build of are a little thicker,  you may run into the same problem I did.  A-side from all that,  they do appear to be of decent construction and the color is as pictured,  nice looking pants,  just ment for smaller people than myself.  Hope that helps,  Good luck!"
2.0,"the stitches started to wear off and look fuzzy, even though I only hand wash it. I use it almost every day in my usual practice."
2.0,The material is very thin. I did not like it. I was able to return the item with no issues.
2.0,This is marked as a medium but the waist size feels like an extra small. Returning! Quality ok or what you would expect  for the price.
2.0,I LOVE this keychain. It‚Äôs beautiful and heavy and really nice looking. It sits in my pocket most of the day and somehow it broke...so beware
2.0,"Pretty genuinely awful. Nothing like it‚Äôs pictured... the fabric is stiff and low quality, the lace is nothing like the vintage style shown, and the color - OH THE COLOR- is middle school coral, NOT the mauvey blush shade advertised, and the fit is frumpy and boxy. Thank god for Prime... this item went immediately back from whence it came!!"
2.0,"This isn't a terry cloth towel material, but instead a very thin microfiber. It isn't dyed all the way through and so the white of the microfiber shows through on the color on the front. The quality was really bad and it pilled a lot. Definitely not worth the money."
2.0,"Ok, not great"
2.0,Searched on large neck gaiters but these are too tight
2.0,"VERY VERY small. I usually wear a medium to large in pants but since these were fitness I ordered a little larger. I ordered and XL, while they &#34;fit&#34; it is in the worse way tight tight tight. If you are ordering these order 2-3 sizes larger then you wear like me I wear a medium so I should have ordered a XXL to XXXL I think"
2.0,20G was a bit too thin for my ears.
2.0,It's an okay dress or a long top. Not a keeper.
2.0,To sheer and the slip underneath was way to short for me. Otherwise it was beautiful but I couldn't wear it to my son's wedding.
2.0,"Nose studs were all different lengths and thickness. Within the first month two of the crystals had fallen out, and I just noticed that I have now lost the last crystal out of the four pack. Not a product is recommend at all. Total waste of money at and resources."
2.0,Snaps right off after a short amount of time being worn.
2.0,"I have purchased two of these at separate times. They are hollow and break very easily.<br /><br />I purchased the second one after the first snapped in two while just waving it in the air. The second one arrived pre-broken.<br /><br />I have duct taped them back together and generally reinforced then with more black duct tape, and still worry I need to treat them with delicacy.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this item two stars is because I haven‚Äôt been able to find a better fake billy club for my police man costumes."
2.0,Band doesn't stay fastened. Received this item 3 days ago. It looks nice but every once and awhile it will come undone and fall off my wrist even though I make sure it is secured
2.0,"I didn‚Äôt expect a crowned jewel but was looking for something inexpensive and colorful that I could wear occasionally. I was very happy when it arrived as it is very colorful. The first time I wore it I loved it. The second time the ribbon kept sliding out of the pendant loop attachment. But, I didn‚Äôt mind, I just slid it back in. When I tried to take it off after I wearing it a second time I was so disappointed to see one of the wings had broken off. It didn‚Äôt seem that thin or flimsy but I guess it is. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again as pretty as it is. I‚Äôd rather spend a few dollars more to have something that will last beyond two uses."
2.0,"Much, much smaller than shown in ad. Shown as same size as 2 other pairs I bought, but actually tiny compared to them. Gave them to my granddaughter. Too bad, cause they‚Äôre quite pretty. Disappointed."
2.0,Light doesn't illuminate the screen like my old one did.
2.0,Not leather!  It‚Äôs vinyl!
2.0,Dimensions don't match the description
2.0,This new style is really annoying.  They refuse to stay in place.
2.0,"The slide mechanism on the belt works fine. I have 2 of these belts. The finish on the buckles of both of them have tons of scratches and look horrible now. I would advise looking for a slide belt with a higher quality buckle. If you just want a belt for doing yard work and don't care about it's appearance, then this is a good belt for that function."
2.0,"The shorts are alright. Coloring is good. The waist fit me pretty true to size. But the crotch area is so baggy! I‚Äôm a girl, I don‚Äôt need any extra space in the crotch area. So weird."
2.0,"This is more likey made for a child, no medical coverage need filter."
2.0,"These are ok but don't seem like they're nearly worth the $124 regular price. More like $15, maybe $20. I don't feel like I really got that great a deal.  AND I've had them less than 24 hours and there's already a nice big scratch/scuff on one lens that won't come out. I imagine more to come."
2.0,"I was not impressed with this piece. I ordered it to go with my child's costume, but she ended up not wearing it because it didn't fit right and just laid on top of her head. I wish it would have had some kind of clip that you could clip from the headpiece to her hair. However, the piece is durable and appears to be made of good quality."
2.0,"My wife tried this on as soon as the package arrived.  She liked the style and material.  Slightly sheer, which is ok, but found it tight around the arms. She normally orders a large or extra large for comfort and went a size above but it was tight around the arms.  Peculiar."
2.0,"Picture/finish wearing off cover, turning pink. When dropped makes phone split from back. Should hold front better."
2.0,These ride up and they are not comfortable. Sent back.
2.0,Cute but runs extremely small. I am an XXL So I ordered one size larger just in case but it didn‚Äôt even fit my 12-year-old hardly.
2.0,I‚Äôll wear it but I wish opening has a little give. It doesn‚Äôt stretch. The care instructions are dry clean only which disappointing.
2.0,Maybe by head is huge compared to most but these are not wide enough for me
2.0,"Good dress but way to small. I'm a 4-6 size and I ordered small, very tight on me and can't even breath"
2.0,Bad quality. Runs small. If you are thinking about purchasing- don‚Äôt.
2.0,"Great sweatshirt true to size however, the fabric was so cheap. It felt like it was made out of plastic. Yuck."
2.0,I don't know if they fit or not. I took them out of the package and put them right back. I don't like the brown on the pants. I will be returning.
2.0,Didn't fit. Too small. Shoddy wefts. Elastic arrived torn. Frizzed and melted the moment I tried to straighten it
2.0,"hard to use, and the needle nose is too short"
2.0,I was very disappointed in this!  It look nice but is plastic and the place for credit cards is very difficult to use and cards tend to either slip down or difficult to get in and out.  Also the credit cards slots are made of very thin  material which I believe will tear with much use.  The place for drivers liscense is very difficult to get in and out.  I am going to send it back!
2.0,No matter how much I wash this jersey it always comes out looking like I slept in it over night.<br />I have never seen anything like it.<br />It will go back.<br />You get what you pay for. I'll go back to a regular bike site to buy jerseys.
2.0,It was okay but too small - I just gave it to a friend.
2.0,A bit too tight to pull on and fingers are far too long. Which makes texting pretty difficult.
2.0,These are cute but fit is for a very skinny wrist. I am 120 lb 5'3 and they cut off my circulation so i can't wear them. Also on the left thumb the material is fraying.
2.0,Cant wear alone because you can see the built in bra through shirt.  Material is soft and comfy but was disappointed because I now cannot wear in summer
2.0,"These shoes are adorable but did not fit properly. I ordered a half size up and the length from heel to toe fit well but the shoe itself is extremely narrow and I could barely fit my toes in. The straps around the ankle and heel were very large in comparison to the rest of the shoe. Even with adjusted the ankle strap to the tightest setting, it still did not work and just made the straps around my heel bulge outwards. I will be returning."
2.0,"The seams in the bust look cheaply made and the straps are comically long! I will be returning! besudes those two problems, the dress looked great, but I couldn't overlook the cheap seams in the bust. I will, sadly, be returning this dress."
2.0,"Very cheap material. Poor quality all around. If I could find this design in a higher quality that wasn't going to rub off and turn my neck green, that would be fantastic. Please work on these things. Sell a good product, get good reviews."
2.0,"I got my ring today and am not happy at all! This ring was supposed to have the Eagle with a swaztika on each side and there is none,I will keep this ring because i do collect many styles of rings,Its just not what i asked for."
2.0,"While this pair of ""earrings"" is incredibly beautiful...it is totally unwearable.  The post is much TOO THICK to penetrate the piercing in my ears.  So pretty...I'm so disappointed."
2.0,I like the color but when it showed up it definitely did not have glitter on it at all like the description says I was a little disappointed.
2.0,"I bought this based on the good reviews, but I‚Äôm not impressed. I have a plastic clover brand that works so much better, and cost half the price."
2.0,It's very pretty but you can lose the watch the pins
2.0,little eye pad came off
2.0,Broke after 18 months of normal use. Just randomly had a crack for no particular reason apparently from just opening up the ends and putting them on. They are cheap for a reason
2.0,Did not like the dress. Definately not true to size.
2.0,The black part is too short - it looked dumb and the fabric wasn't to my expectations. I returned it.
2.0,Nice looking shirt. Size way off.  3xl is more like an L.
2.0,"Pants are cool. Wife likes them. The ""bunch"" in the back isn't a wow factor. The Med was too small and the large doesn't make the ""bunch"" do what its suppose to do. All her other leggings are size small.."
2.0,Received the glasses broken.  my husband super glued them TWICE before I could wear them with my costume. And they were bigger than I thought.
2.0,"These are a no go. If you have hips & thighs, don't bother. I'm 5'2&#34;, 145lbs & they almost didn't make it."
2.0,Men‚Äôs Small is like a men‚Äôs Large
2.0,"So the shirt is huge as you can see in the pictures. I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh 140lbs, I normally wear a medium so I ordered a large because I wanted this tank to have a flowy look to it. I figured since this was coming from China it would be smaller but I was wrong and It's huge. I don't feel too bad, because it was only $5 but really wish I had known about the sizing before I ordered it."
2.0,"I wish the pendant was as nice as the box it came in. The necklace pendant doesn't have the same 'shiny' appearance as in the photo. I was very disappointed when I opened the package. I cannot believe that this pendant is really 14K gold plated. The pendant has the dull appearance of ""cheap fake gold""......you know, that artificial color pretending to be gold? For the price, I thought it would at least LOOK shiny like the photo.......even if it wasn't real 14K gold plating. As it looks, I think I could have found something similar for less at one of the big department stores. Unfortunately, it was a special gift for someone and time was an issue. Now, I guess I'm stuck with it unless I can find something else soon. Save your money, not worth the price. I am disappointed."
2.0,"As others have previously stated, the image shown does not represent the actual product.  The yellow strap does indeed have black printed writing on it &#34;PRETTY OYS&#34;.  The material was soft and the colors were as shown.  I would have kept the wallet if not for the printed strap."
2.0,I did not like the tie because it was too skinny for my body size.  The description stated 3.5 inches but the main body of the tie was less than 3 inches.  It appears to be a good tie but not for me.
2.0,"I absolutely love the print of this dress ‚Äì¬†so much that I'm hanging onto it hoping I'll have a chance to totally redesign it with my sewing machine. But boy is the fit strange on me. I'm 5'9&#34;, basic swimmer build ‚Äì tall and broad-shouldered, 34DD, slim hips and waist. I ordered large because my shoulders and chest sometimes push me out of Medium. The dress was a bit tight over the chest, unflatteringly large in the arms, and then just like a tent everywhere else. Kind of a bit too long, too, and I mean it really, really looked like a tent on me.<br /><br />I'm hoping I can dart the hell out of it in the middle back, leaving the print uncompromised in the front. I may even make it a tank dress, adjusting the length and slimming the profile. That's how much I like the birds :)"
2.0,Did not look like the one in the picture. Lace was way different jacket was not the same. Far less quality. And far too small. Dress was a shirt. Made me look awkward and lumpy.  Very cheap!!  I will probably be sending it back. And it smelled really bad when I received it...
2.0,I was disappointed with these earrings. I requested solid silver earrings and received what was marked as sterling  silver earrings which were very light weight and looks like cheap silver colored earrings.
2.0,There is no way these things are insulated. We were in 20 degree weather and had to cut the day short because these boots were so uncomfortable.
2.0,Broke within the first two weeks of use.
2.0,"I liked this design, but I'm a 10 and order the XL and I could not zip the skirt. The jacket would have torn if I moved at all. Don't get it if you're bigger than an 8. My sister put the jacket on and wears a small and it fit her well (if that tells you anything). Sad it wasn't available in my size."
2.0,"Quality is no good, too large"
2.0,I've bought quite a few pairs of yoga pants and I was disappointed that these were too big and you can see your panties through them:(
2.0,"Arrived today and had holes in it...the tie in the back doesn't stay tied...Nice print, breathable,and comfortable ear loops though."
2.0,"Runs small, and is poorly made even for the price. Order up, and do not expect quality"
2.0,They look great in the photos but I didn‚Äôt care for them as much as I had hoped for.
2.0,I used these for a few weeks. They are very hard to put on your wrist. The band pops loose while you‚Äôre tucking it in the slot. I found it very annoying when it happens 3-4 times each day!
2.0,They're just ok. Fit fine but too shiny to look like jeggings. Should have returned.
2.0,It is very cute but it is also very stiff and pinches a little. The charms do fit on it and it generally looks nice. I have a very small wrist so that could be some of the problem.
2.0,"This is a long story with a happy ending.<br />I have been experiencing swelling in my lower legs that would increase during the day.  My doctor advised me that I should be wearing compression socks to prevent more serious swelling.  I was resisting due to silly vanity.  My daughter gave me a pair of Endurance Shield 360 compression socks and said ‚Äútry these, they are the best‚Äù.  I tried them and they were OK, but I didn‚Äôt believe they were the best.  I had to do my own experiment.<br />I went to Amazon and saw hundreds of choices.  They all sound the same, look similar, and all have a mixture of reviews.  I picked four brands and bought one of each (in black) to try for myself.  It took a while, but the results are in and we have a winner!  My daughter was right: the Endurance Shield 360 socks are the best.  (I just wish they had some colors other than black.) We can all use a little splash of color in our lives sometimes.<br />Here are the details of all the competitors in order of my ranking from best to last.<br />1.) Endurance Shield 360 ‚Äì They are very easy to put on and take off. Good smooth compression graduated up the calf. Smooth transition from sock to skin at the top, so no constriction at the top. They came up to just the right spot on my leg and stayed up on my leg well without any falling down. There is substantial fabric in the foot area that provided good cushioning. I did have to pay attention the right and left, but they are labeled ‚ÄòR‚Äô and ‚ÄòL‚Äô, so it was easy. It would be nice if they were available in colors other than black. I have ordered several additional pairs.<br />2.) Vitalsox VT1211 Graduated Compression ‚Äì These are a close second. They were a little more difficult to put on, but felt good once in place.  They have a band at the top that looks like it would constrict and cut off circulation, but magically do not do that.  The band turns into a very good transition from the compression to my skin at the top.  They came up to just the right spot on my leg and stayed up on my leg well without any falling down. They have a shiny reflective texture in the calf that is a bit different from all the others.  They do come in a rainbow of colors and I have ordered a pair in blue to try.<br />3.) MoJo Elite Recovery & Performance Compression Socks ‚Äì These are a very close third. They are a little more difficult to put on than the Endurance Shield 360 and do not do as good a job of transitioning from the sock to my skin at the top. They do come in many colors and I have ordered a pair in blue to try.<br />4.) Go2 Compression Socks ‚Äì These were too short and left a mark on my leg where they were constricting at the top.  They were difficult to put on.  I am in the process of returning them.<br />5.) Blitzu Power Performance Sport Running Socks ‚Äì These were the most difficult to put on.  They were very short.  The band on the top really cut into my leg and restricted circulation.  I am in the process on returning them.<br />They all stayed up on my legs and did not sag or fall down during movement.  They all provided relief from the swelling that used to occur.  Many of my friends noticed that I was wearing something different and asked about it.<br />It has taken a couple of weeks to try all these socks and over that time I am glad that I submitted to the wishes of my family and doctor.  The swelling is greatly reduced and I feel great.  Health is more important than fashion."
2.0,The material is pretty thin. It's a Large but fits like a Medium. Too small in the shoulders.
2.0,It would have been great but it was way too small and too short.
2.0,Bought this as a gift but was told the quality wasn't the best when I asked. Thankfully it wasn't the only gift I sent her.
2.0,"I've only been using this bag for two weeks. During the first week the large zipper pocket broke. Yesterday the large strap snapped off. All the metal pieces are cheaply made and the bag is nearly unusable already. It was a waste of money and I'm very disappointed.<br />On the bright side, the smaller pouch compartment was good for my drinks, it kept my clothes clean and dry. The shoe compartment was very helpful as well. But the overall quality is terrible and didn't even last long at all. If you have hardly anything to put in it and keep the bag light, it *might* last, but I doubt it."
2.0,It was cute but broke after 2 weeks
2.0,"This is a very decent bag as far as it goes, but I really hate the pink-and-white-striped interior. Is this some kind of joke? I like the outside color because it's pretty nondescipt and it goes well with pretty much everything. Once I open it, though, it's like a sensory overload with the bright pink. With a different interior, I would buy again. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2.0,"If you're an Under Armour fan, I think you'll be dissapointed."
2.0,I haven‚Äôt been able to wear this cuff. It won‚Äôt stay on my ear snd I haven‚Äôt been able to close it around my ear. Very disappointed. It‚Äôs a pretty cuff.
2.0,Horrible looks nothing like the picture. It‚Äôs pretty ugly in person
2.0,Cheap. Got 2 they always break.
2.0,"I have very narrow feet and two out of the six pair were so tight I could not get them over my heels.  The other four pair were fine - a little snug but not uncomfortable.  If someone had regular width feet or wide feet, I'm not sure they could wear them.  They are also rather thin and a bit scratchy.  However, the patterns and colors look cute peeking out from under my jeans (which is why I added the second star)."
2.0,"It looks very cute - I wasnt able to take a full body picture but trust me, its cute, hits the knees; is roomy and fels nice - BUT its only usable if you NEVER turn or move around more in your hospital bed. The closing is so flimsy, it opens too easily. Each time I changed position it opened Somewhere. Even though I had sized up. In the end thats what really ruined it for me, I couldnt rely on it at the hospital at all, I just endep up mooning my doctors and nurses randomly. Other than that I really liked it though."
2.0,The necklace is broken and i expected more
2.0,"Not long enough. The dress is alright, but nothing special."
2.0,Thought the strips on the arm was blue... bought xl thinking to size up. I could wear it as a night shirtüò£
2.0,Dislike the thick cheap feeling of this cap...they should not even list this as a slouch hat....which are what terns want right now...my daughter got two different colors since the price was so low....but you get what you pay for....material so thick...it will NOT slouch at all...So only buy if you want just a regular thick itchy stocking cap.
2.0,"Cool concept. Very disappointed that I lost two spikes on the 1st round and four spikes on the 2nd round that I wore them which is why I gave two stars. Pack does come with extra spikes but kinda stinks that I have already lost 6 spikes after only two rounds. If the spikes stayed put, I would definitely be a dedicated customer but I‚Äôm not gonna waste my money as this rate. I love the concept but just wish that I could make it through a round or few without losing any spikes."
2.0,Poorly made. It is totally different than the picture!
2.0,"This dress is made of super cheap material. As soon as I pulled it out of the bag, I could tell the quality was not good. It was also SUPER tight. It had the correct size on the tag but so disappointed in the quality and sizing of this dress."
2.0,"To set the time you turn the knob the opposite direction than you are familiar with, the crystal is plastic and the strap isn't leather. I suppose for $20 it's a watch you don't care what happens to it, that's a plus - so one more star."
2.0,"This is a nice looking sweatshirt, but I specifically looked for a cotton hoodie. The description says 100% cotton. So I ordered and paid a bit more than I wanted for a gift for my 9 year old. Unfortunately, the hoodie is 100% polyester, not cotton. The exact fabric I was trying to avoid. Sigh."
2.0,Bag is cute and holds a good amount of stuff but it is not sturdy.  Once I would have my computer in the bag along with accessories the bag would constantly tip over.  I have had the bag 10 months and the extendable handle has locked up and now is broken and I am unable to roll the bag like I use too.  I expected it to last longer but it didn't.
2.0,There must be some sort of coating on these shoe laces.  I have to tie them in square knots or else they untie themselves after walking for about 50 feet.
2.0,"Edited: unfortunately after just three months of use these shoes like horrible. My son wears them to school and is a typical boy he runs and plays around. The outside of the shoes have holes in them and the paint is wearing away on the rubber. The inside of the shoes are shredded. I would have expected better quality. We are very disappointed that these shoed did not last very long and looked so horrible after just a short period of time.<br />My son loves these shoes. He's very into real tree and was thrilled to have realtree shoes that he can wear to school.  He wears them as his every day sneakers, but they work well on the playground and for running.  I also like that they have laces, but are quick to get on and off."
2.0,Nice style and material but wrap part on breasts was awkward. I am a D and fabric did not sit right. Returned.
2.0,I was happy with the idea of this kit and it got here quicker than anticipated but the ‚Äúpow sticker‚Äù pretty much disintegrated within and hour.  It was brittle and came apart in small pieces.  I only used the tear sticker because without a template the sticker dots would have been nearly impossible le to get straight.
2.0,The material was not what I expected (much cheaper feeling/looking in person). But the vendor was great to work with and I didn't have any issues when returning.
2.0,"I wore this pair of socks all day.  At the end of the day just doing my normal 10,000 steps, my ankles we3re swollen and the veins were popping  they did not have a true 20-30 mmHg compression."
2.0,These were too small looking and I have a small face. I gave them to my 10 year old<br />Daughter.
2.0,"The charms themselves are cute.  They‚Äôre a nice size and feel comparable (in quality) to the clog shoe brand‚Äôs charms.  They did NOT, however, arrive in a timely fashion.  They were delayed twice, so be aware of that when ordering from this particular seller."
2.0,Mine broke and was missing only a few days after putting it on my keys :-(
2.0,"The sizing isn't even close to right, you'll need to buy at least 2 sizes larger than what you usually wear.  The quality is also very poor.  Very thin almost sheer see through material.  Construction of the shirt is of the quality you'd expect from a middle school sewing class."
2.0,Great case and well made frame however the lenses are horrible. They do not filter out the halo of the oncoming lights and they do not seem to be polarized.
2.0,This bag is cute but it was not very well constructed. The finishing on the edges was sloppy and the tiny cut-outs were not very neat. Overall it is a nice size bag but just looks inexpensive... well it is inexpensive so...
2.0,a great looking vest but misrepresented the size was way too small
2.0,I'm disappointed as the necklace is already looking tarnished. I was excited about getting it but the quality was not what expected.
2.0,"This bag looks and feels cheap. Sure, it has numerous pockets, etc. for organizing files, papers, and so on, but it looks like it was purchased at Walmart, Target, or Office Depot. It definitely looks like it is trying to be something it's not, which is an expensive, well made, attractive bag that a working professional would be proud/happy to carry into work or even on a trip. Did not get the sense that this bag would hold up more than a year or so.<br /><br />Don't purchase this bag unless it's the only one that fits within your budget."
2.0,"Dress was torn.  Other than that, it‚Äôs nice"
2.0,"Way too small! It is very stretchy and the color was pretty and it was not sheer at all, but I couldn‚Äôt actually wear I. Public due to it running small."
2.0,I purchased this dress and it came way to small and I ordered a size up from my usual size.
2.0,I've tried everything and it keeps fogging up...
2.0,I was excited to get my husband a gift just because.... until this showed up just thrown in the box and it‚Äôs not as described or pictured at all. It‚Äôs silver in the center instead of black. The writing it barely legible.
2.0,The mask strings kept breaking when trying to wear product. I should have just returned the mask but thought my fault. Got what I paid for.
2.0,The tape kept folding over and adhering to itself.  Very hard to handle.  Did not stay on skin well.
2.0,They are cheaper looking in person than they appear in the photos. Very overpriced!
2.0,The lights at theatres coming off before to long
2.0,"Too small, donated it?"
2.0,Nice shirt but a Med when I'm an XL.  Felt like I was TommyBoy!
2.0,"I hah high hopes, but the material wasn't good. I tried it on and snagged it trying it on. If I can't even try on a sweater without a snag, it's a hard pass. Cute, but not worth the money."
2.0,"I like the pattern and fabric but I'm a 38B and the chest area is so tight it smashes me. The rest is fine, it's just made horribly and doesn't look or fit right. I also found it odd that the adjustments for the straps are in the front. At first I wasn't even sure which was the front or back but the back has a seam running down it and the design doesn't match up. That doesn't even really bother me as it is an inexpensive sun dress. Too bad, I had high hopes."
2.0,gem fell out on the first wear. wanted to return it but lost the label and couldn't figure out how to get another.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  The glasses are functional.  However, this is my second pair.  The lenses are cheap and on the first pair, one kept popping out.<br /><br />Ok, for yard work and keeps my Maui Jims for good."
2.0,"Fit small, shallow crown"
2.0,Cute but cheap heart shaped sunglasses. The lenses aren't that great though. They barely make the hearts like they're shown to do in the photos. Maybe one will come up from a single bright light but never any multiples. False advertising IMO.
2.0,Cute shirt but much smaller than expected. Purchased as a gift and was unable to give üôÅ
2.0,"Was too small for my wrist, but looked as described."
2.0,"This material wears out quickly in the crotch. I‚Äôve had mine for only a few months and I‚Äôve already seen the material disintegrate and the seams break. I‚Äôve two thumb holes in a pair at the top seams from simply pulling them on with my hands near my hips. However, they are the most comfortable pairs I own and they do significant tummy control. Comfortable enough so that I may still buy these in the future, barring I find a more reliable brand."
2.0,"I liked the stretch, the color of it which was the grey and the softness from it but what I didn‚Äôt like, was that it was kind of see through..I don‚Äôt know about everyone else who bought the same thing but to me it was like wearing tights..the same day I ordered this, I ordered legging with pockets from Pop Fit which was more promising..it fit true to size, has stretch, and wasn‚Äôt see through"
2.0,"I got this wrist band to wear my Fitbit One at night to track my sleep. So I'm putting my tracker in the band and getting it out every day. After just one month of usage, it cracked in a few spots. This rubber or whatever material it is made of is of poor quality. The band itself is comfortable (so two stars instead of one), but it's pretty hard to lock it on the wrist."
2.0,Both pair are broken going to return sadly
2.0,dont like. does not give protection were needed for long rides. Have since broke down and purchased a more expensive pare at a bike shop.
2.0,"The Nautical theme is what attracted me to this romper, and I was excited to get it, I ordered the product in the 12 month size because my son is a big baby both in height and weight, and I was excited to put it on him when I got it. I put it on and it fit somewhat, however where it snaps it didn‚Äôt fit him right, and it was almost as if it was too small because he is poking out of it. The material is lightweight, which is great because I do live in Florida so having something that is lightweight is something that is a great plus because of the fact that it breathes. The anchor that Is on the front you can tell that it was ironed on, so I am going to have to let it air dry because if I put it in the dryer, it may come off with the heat. It is a cute romper, just the sizing is a little off. This is not something that I would purchase again, and I would be leery to buy anything else from this company because you do not know what size you are going to get or how it will fit or the quality of the outfit.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I have not been monetarily compensated for my review and my thoughts are completely genuine and 100% my own."
2.0,The plastic bracelet was very uncomfortable for my son. Not what he expected. So it's just collecting dust.<br />Gave 2 stars because the toy necklace is on quality yarn
2.0,Jacket is nice and seems to be good quality BUT.. I bought 3XL and the recipient could barely get his arms into it! My daughter who wears a small in women's sizes tried it on and liked it. She can wear it over a bulky sweater and still have room.  (I checked the label and it does say XXXL).
2.0,"This is the second bathing suit I have purchased from this brand, but this one ran at least two sizes larger than the first one I bought. Disappointing, because I love the color and style. Sadly, it went back."
2.0,"I can‚Äôt put these on! They are so difficult to put on, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs me. I really like them, but won‚Äôt be able to wear them."
2.0,Returning this one. It is definitely baggy and quite plain.
2.0,Super see through and the materials not that great
2.0,Ran shorter than expected
2.0,Much like the other buyers of this skirt the zipper broke the second I put it on. I replaced the zipper myself and was prepared to do so based on the reviews. Used the skirt for my Comic-Con costume.
2.0,Made from very cheap material.  Would be awesome if it were cotton.  It's a weird material.  Don't buy.
2.0,this ring is very beautiful but it came big and the sides are very sharp
2.0,"I got this as a gift, and he loved it until this happened.  He is wondering if anything can be done to correct this issue.  Please advise, thank you!"
2.0,"Loved the look! I bought this coat for a vacation. Unfortunately the zipper was broken and did not stay closed much of the time. I had to line it up perfectly each wear and it probably took me 10-15 min to get it to zip right. I ended up just keeping it zipped (once finally getting it to zip) and pulling it on like a sweatshirt to avoid that whole fiasco. I should have returned it, but I got it a day before my trip and needed it. You get what you pay for I guess"
2.0,"I work in frozen dept of a store and while these let me stock less clumsily, my fingers still get cold as if I had no gloves on."
2.0,"I received my large messenger bag less than 5 months. On the surface the bag seems sturdy and is reasonably priced. Unfortunately, after 2 months the pull on the back zipper fell off. At the 4 month mark the clasp which allows the front pouch to close has detached. This bag is not even used on a daily basis. I contacted Berchirly customer service and was told that due to the increased cost of doing business they could not assist me and I should consider getting the item repaired locally. Disappointing."
2.0,After one week every charm had fallen off.  Looked down one day and there were no charms.  Found one on the carpet at home. Never found the other two. JUNK.
2.0,It wasn‚Äôt a key chain just the button and the horn isn‚Äôt loud ):
2.0,One of my necklaces was broken
2.0,"First thing, I ordered black...expecting black. These where grey and black not solid black. Second thing the tag says that these are made with materials know by the state of California to cause birth defects and reproductive harm...and these are kids glasses. I had bought another brand of glasses at the same time that has no warning label but does say lead-free kid safe...so maybe the chemical these are referring to is lead? Poison glasses for my kids? No thanks!<br /><br />Luckily the pair of glasses I bought fit my daughter well (other reviews said they might run small). I didn't even try these on here I sent them straight back to amazon."
2.0,THis one is very short and see through.
2.0,item came in damaged
2.0,"Looks nice, but it‚Äôs just really cheap, thin plastic."
2.0,Cheap shirt.  Shrunk big time after initial wash.  Great for the one time holiday use.
2.0,Received. The red is more maroon than it is red.
2.0,Great material but really short. If you want a cropped jacket this is great
2.0,Cheap material. Rips easily. My son wore this once at school for a Halloween party and it ripped down the leg when he put it on. Not worth the price I paid.
2.0,Starts to hurt after a small while wearing it. Gave me a slight headache and i had to take it off. But looks good when on for a second.
2.0,Was just a too big and cut a little funny. Is cute it if it was cut better!
2.0,"Itchy, uncomfy fabric. Pockets puff out, making hips look wider. Might be good for a night shirt. I'm returning it."
2.0,"Fabric is odd, sizing is smaller than it appears"
2.0,Was very wide fitting and didn‚Äôt fall well
2.0,"First, the gloves fit well and @ $11, it is a good value.  However, after 2 months (roughly 25 rides), the gloves are going into the trashcan.  While the seams are holding, the dimples on the palm are falling off.  The Velcro is not hold as tightly because the fabric underneath has been stretched so the gloves are losing its form.  Besides, the gel material in the palm no longer providing any comfort - it was thin when new and now next to nothing."
2.0,"Cheap, but put together like garbage."
2.0,"I have been buying these for about 3 years now. I usually buy 2 packs twice of year as my job gets them pretty dirty and worn fast. In the past I loved these, they didn't shrink and the material was very good for the price. However the last 2 packs I received were defiantly not the same shirt I got in the past. They shrunk a lot and are much thinner now than before. Overall I am disappointed with these this time."
2.0,"The one good thing is it's a decent size and VERY lightweight. But the material looks and feels incredibly cheap. The outside has a plastic type feel and the inside almost feels like felt. It is very thin so I wouldn't expect it to hold up well unless carrying very light items all the time.<br /><br />I get the cost isn't very much, but I have purchased other purses for similar prices that were much better quality. Returning this."
2.0,I like the shirt and seems like good material but I should of went through the reviews first cuz it was definitely a size or 2 to small.
2.0,"While the bag is extremely high quality, with a nice selection of pockets, it's a little too small to be useful as a gym bag."
2.0,"Ordered for thirty keys.  Missing numbers 6 and 11 and had an extra number 4.  Also, the links holding the numbers to the ring looks flimsy and like it could easily pull apart and fall off. Would not recommend."
2.0,Looks pretty.  Didn't fit as anticipated.  Took extremely long too arrive
2.0,"This bracelet is beautiful; however, I almost lost it twice in an evening. It comes off easily, clasp not secure."
2.0,"Its way too small. We live in USA though which makes a difference. Im normally a size 2XL, I ordered a 3XL to be on the safe side and it does NOT fit. The 3XL is more like a Mens Large. I'm sad i have to return it."
2.0,"This watch has small hands and the width is 40mm. The issue I had was with the band. I could buckle the band on the last strap hole. This obviously pushed the two tabs in an uncomfortable position. The watch looks good, but it is small. I'm 6' and 205 and this watch barely fit my wrist. If you are bigger, be advised that the band may not fit."
2.0,The band was small could fit my daughter but not me the intended owner. I don't have large wrist but this was tight like a normal head band. Booo.
2.0,Battery died after 1 month
2.0,Even smaller than what I thought
2.0,I really liked this earring but am unhappy because it is turning my ear green on the first day.
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt fit really well to my key. Looks like it is kind of falling apart. üôÅ I also asked for the black and white and they sent me a blue one.
2.0,Neckline was ill-fitting.
2.0,"Sleek design and attractive but it will not last. Got it on March 2021 to replace my Fitbit bands. Just for 3 months wearing it all the time. Its already ruined. Better to invest in real Fitbit band will last for years. If u want fashion, go for it. But money saving wise not advisableüòû"
2.0,I wasn‚Äôt impressed with this item.. was WAY smaller than what I was anticipating.. I wasn‚Äôt happy with the 2 I got
2.0,Didnt hang right.
2.0,"Smaller than what on the picture and it's not multicolor, just an Ivy color. I'm wondering if this is real natural Opal or lab-created? Bc, it states natural Opal but it doesn't look like it."
2.0,"Not the made well, fabric is cheap üòï"
2.0,Shirt is super cute but the pants were huge and ugly wide leg. She never wore them.
2.0,"Charm was very small. I can deal with that but the writing was very hard to read, not clear at all. Had to tell the person I have it to what it said. I wouldn't buy again"
2.0,"Kinda cheesey in person, not great quality"
2.0,Cheaply made.  Though it would be better made.
2.0,"Not very comfortable, bought these thinking they would be a good breathable alternative to a regular face mask but they do not stay on place and constantly had to be adjusted."
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for:  The Alfa logo not embroidered. It‚Äôs a cheesy looking silk screen or decal. Not worth returning. Will go straight to Goodwill.
2.0,Cute dress but very cheap. It ripped while putting it on the first time I wore it.
2.0,Some what small and the wind does look cut through it but it does look good
2.0,"It is actually smaller than I thought, and then I found out you have to have a power pack which is another 25-30 dollars, not a good bargain for this flimsy book bag, after adding my son's chrome book and notebooks, plus paper, pens and a required book for school way to flimsy, now I have to pay another $6.00 to return it. Not a happy camper"
2.0,The lace is coming apart on the first wear
2.0,Looks and feels like a bathing suit lol
2.0,It's in Asian sizes and doesn't fit larger women
2.0,"The picture shows a pretty blue, the ones I received were black.  I was trying to match a necklace and the black didn't match."
2.0,The snaps are strange.... I don't think the torso part of the Sweatshirt is long enough.<br /><br />If you are busty the sanps take up too much of the shirt body... Anyway it's awkward and I regret the purchase
2.0,It was literally a choaker.. too small ...
2.0,I have a pair from this brand from a few years back that was made with cottonish material? This was loose spandex. I still wear them but not what I wanted
2.0,"Sadly, these sunglasses are not satisfactory.  I understand that they are dirt cheap, yes.  But, they are not polarized, as the seller claims they are.  They did come with a nice, unevenly applied coating on the lenses that make it impossible for your eyes to focus on anything -- think of rubbing a thin layer of liquid soap on the lenses and letting it dry.  I will be replacing these with a better pair.  You don't know what you'll get unless you give it a try."
2.0,Hi ladies I just got my order in and tried it on right away. I wanted to get one of these to shape my stomach and help me wear dresses where I have stubborn areas *my belly from baby . I unbucalled it just to see how everything works and I was struggling to zip up so I took it off zipped up and it was easier that way . It did make my stomach a bit flatter but not impressive flat my figure look like a box I was hoping for coke bottle figure with this shapewear. Then I put the dress I needed it for and it looked ok but I can see the zipper so it was a fail for me.even the crotch area kept unsnapping that's not sexy at all especially if your out it needseems to be more secure . The shorts part was short I was hoping that part would be more loose so you don't feel like a sausage wrapped in plastic . I guess if you wanted it just for the house and to make it sweat it might work but I have seran wrap for that. Im going to be returning. I did recieve a discount for my review but I always give what it deserves and how it personally worked out for me . If your a different body type then this might work for you im not say to NOT get it you always try something once if you like it and go from there. Just for your info I got a Medium and I'm 5'2 135lbs. I hope this helped some I have attached photos of how it looked with a tight dress. Have a beautiful day
2.0,"I bought these for the percentage of cotton.  When the product arrived, the label says 97% polyester 3% spandex. Thankfully they fit my daughter or I would be returning them."
2.0,Kind of cheap looking. Earrings come apart when you try to put them on.
2.0,"I read so many positive reviews of these nightgowns, I ordered three. The problems:<br />Theses are an odd fit, generous except through the back and shoulders, where they are tight and uncomfortable<br />The flannel on these gowns is NOT heavy as many reviews stated. More like the thinnest flannel shirt, definitely not for cold climates<br />After washing, the gowns are even thinner, with more lint in my lint trap than I‚Äôve ever seen. My guess is that they won‚Äôt even make it through the winter, and will end up as pricey rags in my husband‚Äôs shop before the end of February.<br />They shrink substantially in washing and drying.<br />Pass on these, I wish I had. And I will be a little more cautious of SO many positive reviews in future. I‚Äôm sensing some serious dishonesty"
2.0,Not for kids they are men‚Äôs size
2.0,"The 38D, which is what I wear in the vast majority of bras, fit more like a 34B. It was tiny. I couldn‚Äôt even get it on well on the loosest settings and then when I did I had overflow everywhere. An absolute no go for me.<br />I tried posting pics but I guess it wasn‚Äôt allowed due to too much skin showing."
2.0,"The product doesn't appear as it looks in the picture and was a lot shorter in the sleeves and length than the picture. Also the actual fabric with the sequins looked cheap and many of the sequins were falling off before I even wore it. Though this make look cute on other people, this dress simply didn't fit well and was a little deceiving."
2.0,"Donation, sized too small I even order a size larger"
2.0,Zipper had no stop on the end and fell apart as soon as I tried to put it on the first time.
2.0,"It can't quickly and looked beautiful in there beginning. However it doesn't come in half sizes. Then within two weeks of my girl friend wearing it, it became scratched up on the band, and here 3 months later, the band is checking colors."
2.0,"Decent material, cute, but cut small by two sizes"
2.0,Got the beige one in S - it is a nice dress but it is see through - even the pockets. Returned
2.0,Not good for surfing.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 11‚Äù with average build.  The suit just feels sloppy.  Not a good snug feeling.
2.0,Its a real cute shirt but just runs small
2.0,Didn't wash well at all. Jacket faded after 1st wash on hand wash cycle..... Does serve a purpose anymore. Wasn't a great buy for me....
2.0,Junk feel apart
2.0,It was too sheer to wear all by itself even with the layers of tule. Not as fluffy as appears and longer but I did like the length when it was on her.
2.0,Cheap material. Way too small.
2.0,i assumed this shirt would be a cotton material but it‚Äôs like a weird nylon
2.0,"The mask itself fits its needs, but there is no glitz to it. The picture makes it appear glitzy but it is in no way the way it appears in the pic . I bought it for the glitz which is why I decided to give this only two stars ."
2.0,"My son loves the style of these shoes but I am not overly impressed with the material and design. The outer fabric of the shoes is very thin and if you have an active boy, it will rip. My son had a rip in the fabric by week 2 of wear. I am a decent seamstress so I was able to repair but for this price, it shouldn't be necessary. Also, the sole around the toe is already separating. Shoes for kids should be a bit more durable. Not happy. I am surprised given these are Niki's."
2.0,"The coloring on the top is very vibrant and very faded on the bottoms. The blue on the bottom is so faded and dull, it looks like a heather blue."
2.0,"I live in Florida and play beach volleyball.  If the sun is 100% out and hitting you directly on your face they work well. But the minute a cloud come by they are simply too dark for you to see. If you are in your car you can forget about looking at your dashboard or your radio, they are so dark that you have to take them off to look at the speedometer. If you live in Mars I would strongly recommend them, but not here on Planet Earth!"
2.0,"Very form fitted, but pretty.  Not something to wear to work. Seemed more for a night out."
2.0,"If you are well endowed and need support - this is NOT the bra for you!it is comfortable, but offers zero support."
2.0,bought these for running. they look nice but the lens is very cheap. I sort of got what I paid for since these are very inexpensive.
2.0,"I ordered a XL since I'm 5'7, but I have a long torso. This swim suit seems like it's made for shorter people, it didn't fit well at all."
2.0,Soft and reasonably priced but extremely long and one sleeve longer than other. Very disappointed.
2.0,This size chart is for little people or small frame individuals. Ordered a xl and I'm 140lbs 5feet is a little small. I usually wear a size 4/6 because I have a DD 36 chest. Small on me
2.0,This jacket was way to small.  I've ordered 2x windbreakers online before and they fit just fine. The sizes run very small for what their suppose to be.  I need to know how to return this since there was no return slip in package and get a credit.<br />Thank you.
2.0,"Super cute style, but no stretch at all. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, and It looks weird on."
2.0,"It‚Äôs a jumpsuit, but the top was to small to go over my hips"
2.0,Material was cheaper than expected. Had a seam down the center and not as breathable of a material as the full cotton versions by other sellers
2.0,"This product wasn't exactly what I was looking for, although reading the description I thought it was.  I was looking for something to hold and engagement ring and a wedding ring together without soldering them, and not something to make a ring fit tighter on your finger.  Maybe the product description could be made clearer?"
2.0,Cheap fabric. Not very well made.
2.0,"Not my favorite purchase. I should've paid attention to its material... the picture made me wanna think it was cotton, it's not. it's mostly nylon and makes me feel hot and sweaty in less than 2 minutes.<br /><br />2 stars for the colors... It looks pretty. too bad it's unbearable"
2.0,The size was not what should be expected. The shirt is thinner than any shirt should ever be. It‚Äôs see through.
2.0,This shirt was gigantic.
2.0,Was not fleece...was spandex like material
2.0,"Thin, poor quality.  Think twice about buying this.  Runs very small"
2.0,These have no more compression than a pair of cheap knee socks.  This is a clear example of buying the cheaper and learning a lession
2.0,"This bag is like a sociopathic boyfriend. Looks great, but huge flaws by the end of the first month I had it. Those cool studs that hold the straps - they come unscrewed and the sharp pointy end rips into your clothes. Those cute straps on the side? Bad news too, grommet holding it came apart by the end of the second month. I don't carry much or over stuff it. I am heartbroken, but this bag reminded me of the value of good workmanship over looks."
2.0,"These have fallen apart in less than 2 months, seriously horrible quality."
2.0,This item is not for tall women.
2.0,"The velour is not the plushest, which I expected for the price. The reason I ultimately returned it is that the drawstring for the pants doesn‚Äôt even have finished ends - it‚Äôs just a frayed cord! Absolutely not worth buying."
2.0,nada muy incomos le lastiman sus piesitos de tan duro que es el material
2.0,"Was expecting a crop sweatshirt and it was made of thin, flimsy material. Overall disappointing buy."
2.0,Blouse was too loose and baggy
2.0,Size fits to small and after washing color fade-away
2.0,"The stone wasn‚Äôt turquoise,It was colorless. I‚Äôm a bit disappointed by that"
2.0,Although the flower is pretty. Its not ideal on a child‚Äôs dress. The flower is the size of a softball. Imagine putting that on a 4 month olds head.
2.0,"Frumpy looking. Best for Grandma of the bride type of look. Not happy at all. The sleeveless and halter were highly rated but not for my body type, so thought the sleeves would work.  Very disappointed. Overall the Navy lace is over an ivory overlay for two tone look. Might also have to do with why it looks frumpy"
2.0,"I ordered a US size 14/16, although I usually buy size XL shirts and size 12 pants.  I'm tall at 5'10&#34; and like to wear things a little bigger, and the reviews suggested ordering big.  The package read XXXXL!  Trying it on, I really liked the look and shape of it on me although it was way too big.  Going to try again with a US size 10/12, hoping this one is not too small..."
2.0,"Just too damned small. I'm still trying to wear them to see if I can stretch them out, but no go so far."
2.0,My daughter loves this dress! It says 100% cotton but its not. I tried to iron it and there is a big hole now. She will be devastated. I'm pretty sure there is no cotton in this dress.
2.0,Disappointing!!  I was expecting the embroidery to be nicer than it is.  I have other Hmong bags and this one is not up to par.
2.0,very stiff.  Not good quality
2.0,"I like the idea of this product and it seems to be working for my daughter so far, but unfortunately some of the sewing came undone after one use. This just shouldn't happen. I will probably try to sew it up and keep using it because I like the idea, but it would certainly deter me from buying it in the future."
2.0,"I ordered this Prime Wardrobe. The quality looks like it was from a Halloween store, the straps were poorly sewed on and the fit was quite terrible."
2.0,"Its  not the pretty blue color as you see on the picture, it is more like grey color. The material is very  thin, making it look a bit cheap."
2.0,"I got mines today. It is the color of a jade. I am going to take it to the shop to check if it is an aquamarine. If not, I will be disappointed and will be sending this item back."
2.0,"Yes it was cheap, and that's it. The hem on the front of the shirt was uneven to the point the tank look asymmetrical - but hoping that was a one-off instance. But it was quite small and short in length for a Small (purchased for my 16yo teen sister that wears between sizes 1-3 in juniors)."
2.0,"While it is what we wanted and expected and shopping was on time, the black bracelet broke within 1 week of purchase and wearing it. The string was not strong enough a s needs to be thicker and stronger for durability."
2.0,"I liked these at first, because they felt good and fit me well, but on the 2nd gym session the seams under elastic band began to tear and the thighs are showing wear and tear already from hang cleans. Dont know if I got a bad egg or not because the reviews seemed positive. Will probably just look for a more durable set rather than gamble on another pair of these. If you plan on working or powerlifting in these I would do the same. 2 stars because I suppose there could have been a bad seam that lead to the separation under elastic band."
2.0,"The fit is all right, but a cotton lining in the crotch would be nice."
2.0,"The 2 stars are for the material and print- it really is a beautiful ‚Äúdress‚Äù. But not even a petite person could wear it! I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2‚Äù, 120 lbs with measurements 34D-26-34, and the large was slightly tight on the bodice and way too short to comfortably cover anything below the waist. Just lifting my arms would put everything on display. This would,  however, make a cute top paired with leggings. One last thing- I don‚Äôt understand why the green is referred to as ‚Äònavy blue‚Äô when it is clearly not! Needless to say, this is going back for a refund."
2.0,Really liked the material but too large for the size ordered
2.0,It‚Äôs a piece of materiel not sewed at all and flimsy. Very disappointed
2.0,"I bought the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù dress. It is not yellow at all.  It is an orange rust color, as you can see in the photo. The buttons are a full inch off center and are barely even sewn on. The sleeves are closer to a 3/4 than a full sleeve and the elastic in one of the sleeves is a full inch smaller than the other sleeve, which makes rolling them up super awkward because they comfortably fit at very different places on each arm. The elastic is also twisted in one sleeve (tried to untwist it but it is sewn in that way). The fabric is also very thin/cheap, although not see through. With the right accessories it is actually a pretty flattering style and because I know how to sew I may end up keeping it for the price, but you definitely get what you pay for. It is a bit short waisted and definitely needs a belt, but if you‚Äôve got some fashion sense you can make it look pretty good if you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice quality and are ok with ‚Äúwho the heck knows what color I‚Äôll be getting.‚Äù<br />It does not run true to size. I am a US size Medium and I needed the Large in this dress."
2.0,I was not expecting to receive a pair of two different diameter CBRs
2.0,It fits small and looks drab like a mumu. I wouldn't recommend this item unless you're like a size 0 or 2. The bust is super unflattering on the dress also.
2.0,"This is the only buckle I own(Ed), that has a very cheap feel. This is a non metallic buckle and is sturdy but has. Kids toy like feel. It looks great on the picture, but compared to all the other metal buckles it falls short."
2.0,these were great for my son when he could adjust them.  Alas 3 of them have had the adjusting piece fall off in the wash.  My mistake for not trying to return sooner -- naturally we are a few days past the 30 day limit.
2.0,The dress was super cute! I returned it and gave it only 2 stars because it didn‚Äôt fit well around the shoulders. This dress is made to come around the shoulders but it was way too big. Not made for a small chest.
2.0,Dress was very pretty but an XL was actually about the size of a medium. It was way too little.
2.0,"After only wearing the socks once, there was a hole in the inside of the foot.. . .  wasn't  on a seam . . just a tear.<br />Poor quality of fabric."
2.0,"I thought it would be a cool gift for my GF, but she thought it was corny.  Pendant was slightly bigger than I expected.  Overall, the description matched the product, but she doesn't want it, so I'm stuck with this owl."
2.0,Color appeared different in photo.
2.0,It's cute but not for busty girls. Size chart is definitely off.
2.0,Y o u only get one and its doesn't even let you choose the color colors
2.0,Not satisfied. I dont think I will wear it
2.0,"A bit of an awkward shirt in that the fabric is very thin, the arms are too spacious which makes them hang and there were many threads hanging from the very small wood buttons. It is a challenge to iron this shirt for reasons that are unclear. It has vibrant colors as advertised, but I do not expect this shirt to last very long before it begins to unravel."
2.0,The inside was scratchy and irritated my skin.  but it was too hot to wear anything under it.
2.0,"It says stretchy, but even for a small girl it was too tight to be fashionable."
2.0,I bought this watch because I really wanted to keep track of moon phases.  Everything was fine until about 2 months ago when I noticed the moon phase indicator was ahead of the actual moon phase.  I contacted the company (in Germany) and received instructions on how to make changes to the watch.  I tried twice to make the changes but it did not work.  So I paid a lot of money for a poor product.  I do not recommend anyone purchase this watch.
2.0,One pair is useless due to bifocal location
2.0,WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT A GIRL'S SIZE LARGE.
2.0,This dress was too big. The pattern and colors weren't as shown.
2.0,These are super cute but lasted less than a week before we had to throw them away. One full day of my daughter wearing them at school and the inside was peeling out.
2.0,"good:<br />lens snaps securely into the frame and is held tightly in place<br />bad:<br />OEM nose piece doesn't fit with the new lens, it won't hold its proper position"
2.0,My boys loved them then after just two days of wearing one of the sown in tabs holding the elastic going down the front of shoes came out
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in this hat. I have been wanting one for so long, than I get it. And it doesn't fit properly for a thick haired girl."
2.0,"They‚Äôre literally just pieces of fabric. When you put them on, they bunch up at the top of the foot and don‚Äôt have any stretch at all. Plus, you can barely tell what the design is after you put them on"
2.0,Super cute but way too long!  I had to return it. :(
2.0,"Honestly it's just...weird. It's a small (I wear a medium or 8 in most things), but it's both too big and too short. The ties are too long. The shoulders are too broad. The arm scythes are too big. It is super comfortable, so I'll wear it."
2.0,too small!!!!!
2.0,"These are like the bedroom slippers of bras. Comfortable, but totally impractical to wear in the real world. The straps are kind of a nightmare, they gradually slide out of where you tightened them until you feel your boobs sag (I am a 36C, maybe smaller cups won't deal with this). They also tangled up within my first try. The cup padding is bulky which is very obvious under cami or tight fitting tops, and rumpled. I can see these bras being destroyed within two washes. You are better off buying sports bras that don't let your boobs sag. I will wear these around the house when I don't want my nipples to show through my shirt when I answer the door."
2.0,Made very well but this must fit a child's wrist.  Barely fit on my small adult wrist.
2.0,"The material is not what it appears to be. It was the clingy material and was too low cut and too tight (hello camel toe). The picture makes it look like you could wear this out with family to a dinner, but it is actually meant for the club."
2.0,not too happy with the ring guards.  they were too small and hard to install on the rings. i had hoped they were larger
2.0,Bought hat as a gift for our son. Hat was too large so had to return
2.0,I bought this in a size smaller than I usually wear and it was still enormous on me. Big as in at least 3 sizes bigger than me. Size way way down if you're going to give this a try.
2.0,"After 2 wears, the bottom has started to fray :("
2.0,"I wanted a quick throw on then it get a bit colder.  Unfortunately, up close this one looks cheap.  It's a cute design, but I'm only going to wear it around the house."
2.0,It just doesn‚Äôt look as good in hand as it does in the photographs. Runs small! I cannot stress that enough!!! Order 1-2 sizes bigger than your typical size!
2.0,"Super cute but after a month or so, the coloring on the front of the frame is scratching off in multiple places."
2.0,Ring broke the first time I wore it. :(
2.0,"Great fit and love the design, but is NOT chlorine resistant and has faded terribly in a short period of time. I will not purchase this again."
2.0,"too pixelated, graphic stretched to fill shirt."
2.0,Went to wear my hat for the first time and this is what happened... the black one is fine but didn‚Äôt even get to wear this once
2.0,Buckles were not straight; hard to buckle; strap popped off one shoe!
2.0,"While the text says navy as the color, the picture is a much lighter blue. Since it comes from Greece I went on picture. Not light blue!!!!!!"
2.0,"The necklaces came in early and i'll give points for that, however, it did not come with 2 chains as advertised. What came in the mail was one chain and a string necklace. I'm very dissapointed in buying this."
2.0,Maybe it is my fault but these came up on a search for seamless underwear. My child has tacktile issues and the inseam makes her skin break out. Well these have quiet the inseam and most have a bow or design that can't be worn inside out. Unfortunately for me a helpful person washed them before i had seen. So now I have a bunch of kid undies I can't use. Huge bummer.<br />Just make them withour that damn seam!
2.0,I sent back to tight and short.
2.0,The break-away feature is a liability.  The lanyard comes apart so easily the possibility of loss is very high.
2.0,"Is a little dull, not as pretty as the photos."
2.0,Weird shiny fabric.
2.0,"Well i was super excited for these ear. I had plans to wear, i even picked the perfect outfits to go with. They came on time. They looked like horns. We joked around saying they look like fox ears. I also noticed one of the stones was missing. I thought &#34;no big, just glue it on&#34; but when I searched the package it wasnt in there. I was a lot disapointed. I knew i shouldve bought them at forever 21 instead."
2.0,It's cute but after one wash it is completely faded :(
2.0,"The style was lovely, but it was far too small.  ordered two dresses in different designs, one fit and one did not showing that they are randomly sized. The fabric is nice. It was also extremely long so it would only be suitable for very tall women."
2.0,Very cheap materials.  The bracelet broke within a day.
2.0,"Love the look and warmth, but it did not hold up in the wash"
2.0,"I love the length, the fabric is a little thin but looks nice ...but the size is so little that I actually thought that maybe I had ordered a girl's size rather than ladies! They were tiny!!... like for somebody that weighs 100 lbs and I bought a size large"
2.0,"These are fine, but the pictures are deceiving. They are so small, I assume they will be lost in a week. For the price, obviously I didn't expect much but the detail in the pictures can't be seen in the real item as they are too tiny. Almost child like."
2.0,"Okay this material, sucks!!! So so wrinkley you have to iron to wear and it‚Äôs rather wide even though I bought a medium thinking it‚Äôd be snug!"
2.0,If you just want to cover up nipples then this is your bra but if you need ANY support move on...
2.0,"Socks are thin. No real cushion, just made of similar material to upper"
2.0,They were nice initially - until my shoes started eating them. They‚Äôd end up bunched under my toes.
2.0,"Not as expected, small fit, wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,"I thought that I finally found a long sleeved black casual dress when I ordered this Myobe Women's V Neck Long Sleeve A-Line Casual Short Dress/ Tunic.  I was initially excited to see the length was going to be a good fit for me.  I am 5.2 and a lot of dresses are way too long. After reading a few comments about the small sizing, I decided to order a medium for the dress (even though I typically would have ordered a small). The material was thin but not where I would have to wear anything underneath.  I was disappointed when trying it on to find out that the sleeves were way too tight for my arms.  It was so tight that although I was able to squeeze my arms in the dress, I feared that once i washed it, that may not even be a possibility if any shrinkage occurred.  There were no washing instructions on the dress. Therefore, I am sorry to say that the dress doesn't fit me. I would recommend that you order 2 sizes larger than you would typically order.<br /><br />I was able to receive this product at a very nice discount in exchange for sharing my honest opinion and my overall review of the positives and pitfalls of the product. When I buy a product, I always rely on the customer reviews as my best source of information when deciding between similar products. I rely on reviews from people who are using the actual product / item.  I find these opinions are the most informative and valuable for me to make my purchase decision.  The information I have provided here is sincere and unbiased. I wish you the best in all your shopping experiences!"
2.0,"Left glove was great, the right glove has very little thumb-hole access due to there being an abundance of extra material flopping around in there.  I'd give them 2.5 stars if I could, but 2 it is."
2.0,Cheaply made and has already fallen apart not even a month after receiving it.
2.0,Ordered a Medium and it was big. I wear a 4/6 but this was the smallest size offered.
2.0,socks were not cotton.  they were a  blend that was obviously very much polyester.  Gross.
2.0,"Love the style and the overall wash. It fit me very well, however, when I opened the package and was just trying it on, the zipper broke! NO GOOD! Please be mindful of this and the fact that you should to order one size up as I did for this item to fit properly."
2.0,"I bought these Made in America bandanas because Chinese bandanas never soften up.  I have used bandanas since the 1970‚Äôs and every single one of them, American Made, would become buttery smooth after several washings.  I wore glass eyeglasses decades ago and used those soft bandanas to clean my glasses because they didn‚Äôt scratch the lenses.  Being soft like that also made them more useful and absorbent for a lot of daily tasks especially mopping a sweaty brow.<br /><br />These Havahanks are true to size and havent‚Äôt faded but they are perpetually stiff.  Since I ordered a 5-pack about 5-6 months ago I have washed all of them every week and they are just as stiff as the day I received them so they will always be half as useful as they should be.<br /><br />American Made, Chinese Made, what‚Äôs the difference?  Is there any place on Planet Earth where I can get a soft bandana?<br /><br />Maybe I can use them some day to polish a turd....sigh"
2.0,&#34;The zipper broke almost immediately and the pockets are indeed sewn funny and you can't ever get them to tuck in
2.0,Bra too big and bottoms right size
2.0,The mittens are cute and I am able to get my little one's thumb in without too much difficulty.  My problem with them is they are not water proof.  With in a few minutes of playing in the snow they are soaking wet and offer no protection from the cold. I guess we will use them for something other than playing in the snow and continue looking for mittens to wear to play.
2.0,"Don‚Äôt really care for the hat. Too loose on head and don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt bend the hat in the front the way you want to, can‚Äôt see where your walking the way it was made since the hat bends right in your vision path"
2.0,Beautiful but had to return too small
2.0,"Wanted to give these a try as I have the older style of Odessa with the more rounded bottom, as opposed to this more distinct, straight bottom. There is more structure to the bottom, though it is still zero drop and barefoot style. It was NOT as comfortable as the older style, which was like being barefoot. Groundies needs to go back to that style because it was AMAZING. This new one got sent right back to Amazon. NOT worth the $$...it's not even that they weren't as comfortable as the previous style...these were not comfortable at all. :("
2.0,"My daughter said the tag in these panties is terrible!  Super hard and scratchy, even if you try to carefully cut it out it leaves hard scratchy edge.  Only if you carefully remove thread by thread.  Other than that they would be wonderful.  **Need to be tagless for little girls for sure!"
2.0,"Beautiful, but runs small. Buy at least two sizes bigger."
2.0,"I have had a similar ratchet belt - made by Mission - for 4+ years. I found it at an outfitter while on vacation and used it almost daily until recently - when the belt itself (the strap, not the buckle) was starting to show signs of wear.  I loved that belt and found this one when hunting for an adequate replacement. I selected this belt because it was a similar style, but cheaper. And most of the reviews were positive.<br /><br /> At first it seemed OK. I like that it came in one size - trim to fit. The ratcheting mechanism also worked fine. And it looked nice. But the buckle started to fall off pretty regularly when I removed the belt. At first this was a minor annoyance, but eventually it resulted in scratches on the buckle if it fell on a hard floor. I could expect it to fall off a few times a week, no matter how careful I was.  I‚Äôve fiddled with the mechanism and even trimmed the belt further in order to reattach the buckle on a new spot, but the problem only gets worse.<br /><br />The final straw was when the buckle actually fell into a urinal - yuck!  That night I threw away the buckle that came with this product, and attached my trusty old Mission buckle (which fits and functions perfectly with this belt). The Mission buckle does not fall off this belt.<br /><br />I‚Äôm happy enough now - I‚Äôll get plenty of mileage out of this product with this modification. But if you are looking for a decent new ratcheting belt I‚Äôd recommend spending a bit more to make sure you get a higher quality buckle."
2.0,"I had to return the cardigan. It fit too tight in the arms and the collar was wide and distorted, it wasn't made well at all."
2.0,It's small. Order one or two sizes bigger so it'll fit comfortably. I'd like to return it for a bigger one but I haven't heard back from the company.
2.0,"Very poorly made, one of my clips was even sweet on backwards! For $13 they‚Äôre okay, but I would buy a more expensive, higher quality set next time."
2.0,"Ordered a Size 8. Shirt and vest were an 8, pants were a 10. Pants look cheap. Shirt and vest look sharp and we'll mafe."
2.0,Scratchy cheap like material. Not at all worth what I thought I was getting.
2.0,"Not flattering, dingy looking, weird fit"
2.0,Disappointed in this shoe.  It is does not breath at all and your feet burn.  Wearing with a sock is painful as your feet get to hot.  This is in normal summer temperature.  Liked the old ones much better.
2.0,"Cute saying, but shirt runs very small in sizes, I were a large, so I order X-large it was small on me."
2.0,"Edit: Sadly I need to detract two stars. It's a beautiful ring, but after less then a month of wear and being very careful with it considering the plating. Its turned my finger black. Makes my heart sad because I really liked this ring. Well if you don't have sensitive skin like mine it's a good purchase,  but if you do stay away.<br /><br />With and without flash. It fits true to size and the stone is true to color for the image. Could even be mistaken for Helenite. Which I love. I have severe skin allergies to nickel and copper and thus far as I have worn it since Monday all the time. This is with going to work working heavily with my hands. Washing dishes and so on. It has not turned my hand green nor has the plating chipped in any way. So it's been 4 days. That's a good start. The only reason for the 4 and not a 5. The diamonds on the sides sit in awkward places and stab the fingers a little. I turned it about and it doesn't seem to bother. Also the main stone sits a little loose and does spin a small touch. Nothing a set of my jewelry pliers won't fix. Over all especially given the price very happy. Would buy again. I will update if it does change my finger or if the stone falls out. But over all sound purchase."
2.0,"Super cute, but it puts too much pressure on my head and bridge of my nose, which results in head aches. If only wearing for a short while then they are cool, but for a long time I recommend finding something more comfortable."
2.0,Purchased these for a gift for my sister.  They were beautiful.  She could not get her hands in them. Too late to return them so we gifted them to our niece.
2.0,It was cheaply made and was not the same size as what I ordered . Very disappointed
2.0,It was pretty. However it soon came apart
2.0,"Im not crazy about them, at all. They are a nasty yellow and the glue shows, so it looks tacky."
2.0,Picture was not a good representation of actual item.
2.0,I love how the dress fit but it broke just when I was trying it on.
2.0,"This is terrible. Whoever crafted this jersey should seek professional assistance from an ophthalmologist immediately. The sleeves go past my elbow, the length is fine, but the chest is probably 2 sizes smaller than I ordered. There is no way this is correct and if it is, may your deity of choice have mercy on your soul"
2.0,"These are very limited as to the mask strap size... think ""tiny.""  Also, my 9 year old didn't make it to school before it broke.  They are pretty but not very practical."
2.0,This was not made of metal.  It was like a painted plastic much like you'd see on a toy.  I requested a return and at least was refunded.  If you don't mind wearing plastic... then by all means forge ahead lol.  I gave two stars simply because I was readily refunded.
2.0,"I love this idea of being able to cover your bottom and spruce up a pretty sweater. How ever, it is tiny!<br />I ordered a medium and there is no way I am even getting it passed my knees.  Not worth sending all the way back to  china as it already takes to long to receive the item."
2.0,"The style was cute, but the quality was awful. The rose gold tarnished after a week, almost looked like pink and brass, bizarre.  It's so stiff that it is almost impossible to fasten, and over the course of a week started to peel.  I was so disappointed."
2.0,a bit on the cheap looking side.
2.0,"I'm 5'11&#34; tall, 38&#34;-28&#34;-38&#34; chest-waist-hips and typically wear between an 8 Tall and 10 Tall dress size (U.S.) This jacket fit loose and frumpy - makes me look like my grandma. No offense, Grandma. The sleeves are also way, way too short. I will be returning."
2.0,Nice color but too snugg
2.0,"I REALLY wanted to like this as my anniversary trip was coming up, but it has a weird fit. The neck line is odd, even when I tried to tuck it in as others suggested. The color was pretty, material is very sturdy and nice, but the fit is just NOT there."
2.0,The posting for the product made it look like a great value so I ordered. When it arrived I opened the package and I found it the threading was coming loose and causing the seams to split open and it looked really shoddy I had to end up sending it back
2.0,Night time glasses are not polarized.  Totally useless.
2.0,"Dear Madam or Sir;I'm very happy to purchase these products provide submissions to the turkey was disappointed me.I've seen the size of all products from the Amazon so far I've never seen the size of the size of the size of a large number of measures on the sale.I'm really sorry I don't have the chance to change it back and have no one with this foot size.From now on,ƒ± leave you to do authorities,understanding of customer satisfaction. Maybe make a gesture and send it to the appropriate extent.Your sincerely.<br />Thank you, G√ºrsel Akyol"
2.0,I wear xl ordered 2 x .. does not fit.. I‚Äôm just not sure how I feel about the quality
2.0,Didn't fit and were returned.
2.0,I really liked these boots. They look nice and are comfortable. I've only been wearing them for three months though and the soles have separated from the uppers. I wish they were better made.
2.0,Nice necklaces in looks but break after a few wears (I wore them twice before they started to break on me)
2.0,everything was fine except the backs were too small.  I don't need eleven more words to tell you the backs were to small
2.0,SIZES RUN WAY SMALL
2.0,Cute onesie but had holes/torn in the armpit area before baby even wore it.m.<br />I bought it just for pictures with big brother so I only needed him to wear just ones
2.0,turning copperish after i took it out of bag and left it out in my jewelry box. i only wore it once and it did not get wet!
2.0,Yeah ......definitely order AT LEAST one size larger. This is really tight around the rib cage. I'm a 36A<br />......and I had to return the L for an XL.
2.0,"The Item arrived as promised, fortunately, because it arrived on the Birthday of the recipient. It worked once I Installed batteries, the problem I had with this item was that the package was torn and looked like it had been used and returned. Because this was a gift for a child and I would not be able to get another one in time to wrap him a new gift for his birthday I kept it but was disappointed in the shape it arrived. the 2 stars were because 1 it arrived on the correct day, and 2 it worked."
2.0,Young teen sizing. I purchased a large and it wouldn't fit my 103 pound daughter who is tiny and wears a women's XS. It was a pretty blouse but this is not sizing for women/misses. For reference I wear a size 4 jean and usually a size medium blouse (5' 6&#34; and 137 pounds and a fit runner).
2.0,Didn't work for reducing eyestrain. The lenses are too light to do anything. I returned them.
2.0,"If you are bigger chested, don't bother. The material is really nice - soft, flowy and light (perfect for the beach) but if you are top heavy, it wraps around and sits on your boobs really weird. Definitely doesn't curve around the girls nicely like it shows in the pic. HOWEVER! If you wear it backwards it still looks pretty cool! Just wear something underneath since it is really see-through with only one layer covering your chest, instead of the double wrapped layer."
2.0,"Fabric was a cheap polyester, not a sweatshirt  fabric like it looks"
2.0,Not the quality I expected for the price.  The mirror had fallen off and won't stay stuck. Not a good buy.
2.0,"Ripped before we got on the plane, but the good news is that silver duct tape matches it nicely!  Just always throw a roll in your bag!"
2.0,Said it‚Äôs large but in fact it‚Äôs not.
2.0,Cute but my girls get them off in less than a day
2.0,"Fits great, I ordered an XL and I normally wear a large at stores like Old Navy or H&M. Feels exactly like you'd expect a $20 polyester blazer to feel. I really like it but it's described and pictured as burgundy and this is definitely a cherry red."
2.0,"While cute, it is big. I was hoping it would fit a little tighter."
2.0,The top of dress is very big.the dress came all wrinkled
2.0,"These are cute and work, but I two have fallen out in 3 days (both while I was sleeping). Couldn't locate them unfortunately... my piercing (originally pierced 2.5 yrs ago) seems to want to close quickly, so it's added tissue damage each time one falls out at night."
2.0,Nice material but is was too small..
2.0,The pattern is a pixelated image printed on fabric.
2.0,fit is tight
2.0,"I ordered a medium but when i tried it on i thought i had gotten a small. it was way too tight on the arms and shoulders, it fit everywhere else but it was way too tight on top. not to mention the quality of the sweater is very cheap and plasticy. i don‚Äôt think i would but this again."
2.0,"Fit fine and was cute but I‚Äôm covered in black dye now, and my cream Louis bag is now closed covered in black dye. Wash it before you wear it."
2.0,They don't keep your hands warm in Wisconsin winter maybe further south they would be okay. Seem to be made well.
2.0,"Straps gave me achy shoulders.  Print is very cute, maybe it's the halter fit, but the straps did not work for me.  Medium support, ok for yoga, but not running."
2.0,"These are so tight on me - I wear a size 8. I can't imagine them being comfortable on anyone with a larger foot.  Aside from the length being very short, I also had deep imprints all around my ankles after wearing them for a day - not comfortable.<br /><br />The material feels nice and the quality seems fine, just far too tight.  Unfortunately I already washed them, otherwise I would be returning them."
2.0,"As another customer noted the sweater is more of an olive green color than a brown, thus I returned it. I am surprised Amazon supports such misrepresentation."
2.0,Disappointed to say the least.  Won't bend at all and looks super cheap.
2.0,"So I have an hour glass figure... this shirt, the cut and asymmetrical hem line looks god awful on my figure.  It's cute... on the floor.  Lol!  You can't wear regular bra.  Wearing a strapless bra doesn't work out- it.makes the odd cut on top stick out badly. Just absolutely 100% unflattering in every way. Also runs small. If you're not real thin.... ain't gonna work out"
2.0,"It fits. As with my spring bars, it is working and doing it's job. I just need it to hold the Fitbit Charge 2 so I can put some paracord bracelets on it. I have it hidden on the underside of my wrist, so I'm not going to complain as there are absolutely no options at this point. I knew it was going to be a crappy product. And it is living up to expectations. But as I said, it is working and holding my paracord bracelets, so at least it has that going for it."
2.0,"I gave it away.  It was not what I expected, although, it fit just fine."
2.0,these slippers are flimsy and they are too big. i normally wear a 7.5 and ordered a 7.5 and they are too big. i would say they are about an 8 or 8.5 maybe
2.0,Love the dress but runs very very small in busy & I ordered up one size & still to small
2.0,"Colors are beautiful. Bought this for my 8 yr old. She loves it, but the should strap is extremely short for a cross body. it can perfectly fit a 5 or 6 yr old. Also when I bought it, I was expecting a messenger bag. not a wallet."
2.0,The item came in a timely manner and was pretty but the fit was faaaaar from XL and no stretch retuned it immediatel.
2.0,The material is good but there was no seam in the back of the dress
2.0,"I ordered the deal with 2 pairs.  The blue pair was ok, but the black pair had the print of the zipper way off from the center of the crotch.  I returned both pairs since it was purchase that way without trying either pair on because they look CRAZY SMALL and I didn't want to mess up the return.  I reordered another set in hope that both pairs will work."
2.0,"I am disappointed. The T-shirt is very poor quality: the collar folds over, it is not a women‚Äôs fit (it‚Äôs very straight) and the medium I ordered is huge!"
2.0,The adhesive is really bad üò¢
2.0,Unfortunately the earring tassel doesn‚Äôt stay in place. They‚Äôre cute but constantly have to adjust them
2.0,They were beautiful when they arrived but stained black around the edges after just wearing them a few times.
2.0,"I've actually ordered these 4 times now! I don't know what happened because the first 3 times, all of the colors matched the pictures. However, when I ordered the Royal Blue, I ended up getting what looks like the Sky Blue color, but on the packaging it said I had received Royal Blue. I needed it to be a specific shade of blue and unfortunately I cannot use them :( which is a shame, because these are incredibly comfy pants!"
2.0,"Product was fine until I discovered a very visible, deep scratch in the plastic in the upper left-hand corner of the rim when I took it out of the package. The white under the red paint makes it quite noticeable."
2.0,Looks cuter in picture. Wanted to return it actually. But keeping to use as work out bathing suite only.
2.0,So I ordered the flamingo but got the crab character instead. Luckily my daughter loved the crab so we kept it. We have used it all summer long and it‚Äôs worked really well! I would give this product 5 stars except they sent me the wrong item.
2.0,Sleeves were not cute like in the pic and was too small and see through
2.0,I squeezed it out of curiosity and it is so soft it bent
2.0,"I received 2 bras, one was the correct size the other was 5 inches smaller."
2.0,"Toes are too pointy, looks like costume more than functional boots"
2.0,the material is not at all as it is pictured.
2.0,"The purse is cute, but it is smaller than I realized. It looks cheaper than I expected also. I chose not to give it as a gift to my friend's little girl."
2.0,Disappointed with color!!!<br />I took my pictures outsidem so you can see how dark they are.
2.0,Not true to size that's why I give it a 2.
2.0,The glasses are nice but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a ‚Äúdurable frame‚Äù the frame breaks without much manipulation. Second pair that has broken. The glasses are great while they last...
2.0,"This product is not true to size, they run small."
2.0,These pants run about 3 sizes to small. They are made in Europe for small built people. Otherwise they are nice. Gave them to a neighbor.
2.0,"I love the actual look of the bag. However what i didn't like was that it only had a small piece of packing paper inside so, when i received it the bag was squished and bent in the back. The bag was horribly packaged."
2.0,"The chain was broken when I opened it and I was able to fix it by bending some wires, I was disappointed in the length of the earrings."
2.0,Oddddd shaped on top. Very wide
2.0,"I loved the bright colors the socks came in, however, they were much to small (Men's size 12). They were impossible to pull on, and on pair ripped immediately. I do not recommend for anyone with a men's 10 or larger, otherwise, they would have been a great buy."
2.0,Love the look but I can‚Äôt get the shoes to fit meüò¢
2.0,Might as well get silver. Rose gold comes off
2.0,Ordered 2. The actual lenses are distorted and won't allow for clear application of makeup.
2.0,I have these about 2 1/2months. At first they seem great. They looked good and do look good from far. However within a week they started to stretch out and lose the little elasticity it had. Some of the beads were misshapen also. It still works for meditation but i have to be careful.
2.0,"I was hoping they would be just like the store brand, they were too small and not the same material, they were heavier"
2.0,Had to return item. The description didn't advise of the size
2.0,They are more of a faded red than the bright red in the picture and fit very tight in the thigh but good in the waist also you will be paying for your own return.
2.0,They fell apart coming out of the package.
2.0,Did not fit the watch its advertised for
2.0,"I wore this when riding my bike.  The back flap was ok, but the front brim kept bending up, exposing my face.  The same thing occurred when there was a slight wind when I was walking and it wanted to blow off."
2.0,"Ordered the 6 should have ordered the five, plan on returning, purchased Teva's instead. Best idea ever getting the Teva's.  Fit like a glove"
2.0,My foot kept slipping off the shoe.
2.0,I give it a 2 star because it's a little tight fit.  It's made of stretchy material and very thin.  I'm afraid to dry in the dryer because it might shrink even smaller.  I'm 5' 105lbs and it's still too tight for me to wear comfortably to the office.  I would recommend getting 1 size up if you planned on purchasing this.  It's a one piece material - cheaply made.
2.0,Small and cheap looking. Not gift worthy.
2.0,"I wear a womens size 10 pant and a 36 inch belt gives me extra room although I sometimes purchase a 38 inch belt to wear around my hips.  This belt is smaller than a 34 inch belt.  I can't use it, even tightly around my waist.  The adjustment on the belt ONLY makes it smaller, NOT LARGER.  It is a nice quality belt and the embroidery is beautiful."
2.0,"Overall, it's only okay. The logo is good quality and looks as pictured. The sweatshirt is thicker then I expected. The product picture makes it seem a little more lightweight but it's actually quite thick. While it is made of very soft material it has absolutely no stretch to it at all, I mean none. When I attempt to roll up the sleeves the cuff on the wrist squeezes my forearm and it's very uncomfortable. It also took nearly three months to arrive, and a lot of messages to the sender. Waiting all that time really wasn't worth it to me. I also noticed that the price has increased about 25% since I purchased it, and I definitely don't think it's worth the price."
2.0,Doesn't fit. I even bought 2 trying to fit in the bigger size
2.0,I wanted to really love this scarf so bad but the quality is just terrible.
2.0,Ok so... idk if I just don‚Äôt know how to do it but I feel like I‚Äôm messing my hair up more trying to get it in this cap than I would just sleeping on my hair.<br />Usually people with curly hair have a crap ton of hair (me!) lol I cannot get it in here without spending like 20 min going back and forth pushing it all in. I‚Äôve tried different ways but always ends the same. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone get these if you‚Äôre trying to get a lot of hair in there. It‚Äôs really hard.
2.0,"The material is not what expected, shiny and uncomfortable"
2.0,"I bought the yellow dress thinking it was a dark gold because of the way it appeared online but low and behold it's actually PEACH! Very disappointed.<br />Also, the sides of the top cut way too far in and half of my breast pops out. I'm a nursing mother right now so maybe my breasts are too round for this dress because other customers look great!<br />Wish this dress fit me properly because the top would be great for breastfeeding"
2.0,"There isn't enough material in the front panels to offer any coverage. The length is nice but the sleeves are too short for me. The fabric seems nice, but wrinkles easily.  This will be returned."
2.0,I am 5' 8&#34; and take a normal size 6 in underwear which is a medium.  These panties ran very small.
2.0,"Runs very small. Not impressed with the quality of fabric nor the fit. It took weeks to arrive & company didn't want to take it back. Suggesting I give it to a friend or family member that might be ankle to wear it, offering me 40% off. Not what I wanted to do but was give no other option."
2.0,had to return it nice bag but didn't have a compartment for my credit cards
2.0,"I was disappointed in the look of this coat and returned it.  There is a horizontal seam that I think is supposed to be at the waist, but it was not straight.  Instead, it curved upward in back towards my shoulder blades, so the drape in the back was all off."
2.0,Everything about this item is acceptable except the wide elastic waistband inside the fabric will become twisted and affect the appearance and fit. It will still fit but with a bunched up waistband which some like myself might find irritating.
2.0,not easy to get in septum.
2.0,The watch looks fine but the stainless steel bezel gets constantly stuck. Really stuck. That is a critical flaw.
2.0,"I was really looking forward to using this apron, it is very thin, and flimsy.  I haven't decided if I will just give it to one of my grands or send it back.  A heavier fabric would have been helpful and more protective."
2.0,"material was very soft, but an XL fit like a medium."
2.0,Too small and the white top is very see through.
2.0,I did not like it. It was not what I had expected. Pockets too small. Not enough pockets. Looked nothing like the picture of it on the website.<br />I returned it.
2.0,"The glasses are nice, i will have expected something a bit more based on price.<br />Again I'm not complaining about the quality but according to price my expectation was higher. I will recommend to look for something different."
2.0,"I really like the concept and style of the shirt, though I do think they took the looseness a little too far. More bothersome to me is that the patches over the elbows for whatever reason don't actually end up sitting squarely over my elbows, and instead they end up sitting to the forward side of my arm a bit, and the result is that it feels a bit awkward to bend my arms. I'm not sure if how I hold my arm is a little off somehow or if they were a little off in sewing the sleeves of the specific shirt I got, but it makes a shirt that I think would otherwise have been fairly comfortable just not work out for me."
2.0,Bags are too small<br />Looks bigger in the photo
2.0,"Tight across the chest (not too tight, like the typical tight shirt comfy, I'm 36C) but the bottom of the shirt isn't nearly as tight as I want it, fits loosely and there is alot of space between my skin and the shirt vs it being skin tight, and that kind of ruins it."
2.0,The pineapple in the picture looks different then the one on the actual shirt. It‚Äôs not as nice.
2.0,Sizing runs a bit small.  But ended up returning this and one I bought in a different size because the white lining that backs it shows where ever it doesn‚Äôt lay flat.  Two layers of the same color or any other color would have worked.
2.0,"The dress is super cute, but says long sleeve and it's not.  It goes a little bit past the elbow.  So quarter sleeve."
2.0,"Returned on opening as these weren‚Äôt small, they were minute ! Not a complete review as can‚Äôt say anything else as they were gone ASAP"
2.0,"Ok I admit I was hooked by pink satin leopard print, Amazon recommended that I buy my usual size (I have a lot of these satin pajamas from various sellers and until now the fit has been very consistent) so I picked them up. And the print is pretty cute, although the fabric was not as good as the others I have. But the sizing - easily 6""-8"" smaller in the waist and 4"" shorter in the leg length. I didn't even try the top on. It does come with a lot of pieces, and this is a print that's very hard to find but size way up and be prepared to return"
2.0,"Totally different than pictures!  Different neckline, different fabric, totally different dress!  Definitely not worth the money!"
2.0,"Dress was too long and too big on the waist. I‚Äôm usually between a medium, large and this dress was too loose and the material was not very flowy."
2.0,At the firs time look cheap
2.0,I usually dont like to give  2 starts but i think that i have  to. i was so exited to get my  necklace and  i just when on vacation and took it with me.  i did not shower with it and  with one  time that u used it  on my vacation  the necklace became yellow . i really like it but IM scared the the other one that i bought will do the same thing ones i use them
2.0,I do like this however unless I push the neckline to one side it doesn‚Äôt fit over my shoulders. The neckline is also coming apart which is upsetting because it seems like a good quality fabric. I did order another one a size larger so I‚Äôm hoping it fits better.
2.0,"This is a nice bag that is roomy and a good color.  Unfortunately, the handle broke after 60 days, and it can't be repaired.  I'm disappointed."
2.0,Too tight around my thighs
2.0,Definitely not womans sizes. Cute dress on a 12 year old though!
2.0,I was expecting a little heavier robe. It is very clingy and thin.
2.0,This thing pulled every single hair out of every single bit of skin it touched on my arm.
2.0,Just received the navy blue which is same size same brand than the white color underneath. The arms of the new item are noticeably shorter like more for a toddler of 4 yo.<br />We purchased the white color last year- still fits my now 7yo child who loves the quality hence why we ordered the navy blue this year.<br />We re disappointed the fabric on the arms got shortened (to save cost?) we didn‚Äôt try it on as it‚Äôs supposed to be the same product just different color so just washed it for my girl to wear it at school: Then she mentioned about the arms- can‚Äôt return it anymore. 2 stars for the nice color and the softness of the fabric.
2.0,Dosen't flatten my belly which is what I got it for
2.0,"Very disappointed, the pants were way to big, and they were not what the picture showed, I will never buy them again, if you pay for something you should get the right product.i brought them because my son loves the character and wanted to be him for Halloween, but he can't now he was really mad. I'll be careful on what I ordered. from now on very dissatisfied with the product."
2.0,"clingy material, didn't like."
2.0,"This skirt is obviously cheaply made..like halloween costume quality. The worst part for me was that it looks so orange in person! I know that it is a sort of rust color, but I look like a pumpkin. On top of that, the waist is far to big for me, but I will not blame the company for that, as my waist is small and I run into that issue with most A line skirts. Keep in mind that these run slightly bigger and brighter than you expect. The other colors may be fantastic if you don't mind the quality, but I am not pleased with this purchase."
2.0,Poorly made and useless
2.0,not whast was expected
2.0,"Very comfortable to wear, with beautiful stones! My only complaint is the length of the stones is very short, I have thick earlobes and these low profile saddle plugs don‚Äôt stay in well overnight, especially in a...well cheesed ear. Would love for these to be a little bit longer end to end, would prevent losing them."
2.0,"hem of legs are uneven ,size is bigger than chart on web site."
2.0,"Sizing was true to the chart provided. Very poorly made skirt. Thread hanging off everywhere, thin, see through fabric, doesn't sit well on the body. I looked like a terrible version of big bird in."
2.0,"Too thin, and they kept coming off at the heel."
2.0,I ordered an XL but wear a L. It is to short like my rear end hangs out. It will be ok with leggings and boots or booties. But its longerbin front than back so that looks a little funnt may return
2.0,"I like the size and they are very sparkly....however, the stones were put on haphazardly and alot of the white base shows through.  It looks like they missed spots."
2.0,Too thin and too short
2.0,The sole feels like it's made of wood.
2.0,Plastic balls break very easy but the ones with metal balls are great.
2.0,Not good quality. It looks like a toy ring from a candy machine :/ not worth the price in my opinion.
2.0,Wish they had xs. Be sure to examine the picture of the product. Didn't realise the waist band was not a regular waistband
2.0,The chain and pendant are not as shown. Chain is very very thin and so is the pendant
2.0,"Did not like material, no shape, disappointed the way it looks"
2.0,"I bought these same socks at Kohl‚Äôs and wanted to warn other parents - these are NOT 2t-4t! They are cute, and my 2.5yo adores them... and they already barely fit his feet. He wears a size 5 shoe! These are 12-24 size. Now I‚Äôm on a quest to find Thomas socks in his size because he won‚Äôt wear anything else..."
2.0,This are ok earring. Pretty just a little bigger then I thought
2.0,Got rusty fast
2.0,"They are quite big and they look to have something gold in the center but even getting closer, you can't tell it's a lion.  If you want them for that purpose, there are others"
2.0,I thought I would give these a chance. They are probably great for the price. They aren't comfortable. They smell like a rubber yoga mat. They need a cleaning when you open the 'new' sunglasses. I wouldn't buy them again.
2.0,Ring was a bit on the smaller size. Wish there are half sizes
2.0,I don't like that the leggings fall down and I'm not buying a garter belt.
2.0,Suggest getting one size bigger than your shoe size
2.0,"I love the color and shape of this watch but I HATE the wristband. It's a clasp that's different from the one shown, and you can't adjust it. The watch is way too big for my wrist and slides around too much."
2.0,"We had to purchase express shipping and recieved it on time. We recieved a pretty damaged pendant. One ding wouldve been fine but this had multiple, deep, indents everywhere. Not okay, as this is a gift for my mother in law."
2.0,The strap was to short and the buckle is a little extra wide. But its fine.
2.0,"For a North Face product, I expected better. It was thin. I found a cheaper product with a thick fleece lining and better stretch. This is not worth the money"
2.0,"I love the print and fit of these pants. The fabric is very soft. What I don‚Äôt like and why I‚Äôm returning them: they‚Äôre totally transparent. (I bought the cream color.) Ta ta, pants! Too bad. :("
2.0,"Cute, color is true to the photo, fairly well made for the price, but very small. I bought this as a gift and the recipient is a small person, so hopefully it will fit. It is tight on my head."
2.0,The studs were not all the same
2.0,Slightly too small for Surface Pro 4.  Bag needs to be maybe an inch longer to comfortably fit the device.
2.0,"I love the hat.  Too bad it doesn't fit and was misrepresented in the descriptions, which claims that the one size fits all.  I don't have a particularly big head.  The only way I can wear it is if I jam it down on my head which is very uncomfortable because it's so tight.<br />I bought this because I had a pre-cancerous lesion removed from my face by a dermatologist who told me to wear a wide brimmed hat from now on when in the sun.  I thought this would be ideal for me.  Sadly, it wasn't."
2.0,It broke really easily. It is very disappointing
2.0,"M√°s o menos, esperaba m√°s bonito"
2.0,"Package came, contained a black box with a velvet bag inside ‚Äì therein was 3 small plastic bags two of them had 4 buttons each, the other had 1 cuff link.<br />Product looks great.... but need to return for correct order."
2.0,These are not cute little petite earrings. They are large and look heavy on the ears.
2.0,The shoes are really cute but I was extremely disappointed they arrived all scuffed up on the princess with black marks all over her yellow hair.
2.0,This belt actually worked great! It was rachetting well and convenient to use. Only problem is the belt broke after 2 weeks of use. One of the gold metal peices that holds the belt in place stopped popping up. Could be a broken sping or something.
2.0,Nice looking watch.  It felt quality and I got quite a few compliments on it the 2 short days I wore it.  Unfortunately the automatic works failed to wind it.<br /><br />Side note I got the black with gold face accents with gold hands.  That made it difficult to read.  And the lume was weak.
2.0,Material is fading and pilling after one wash. I followed the care instructions and it already looks like it had only one more use in it. Pretty expensive for a 2 time use for this dress.
2.0,Sizing was completely too small.
2.0,There was no support in the chest area. It was too large there. I returned the swimsuit
2.0,"So I wear an 11. The slippers in my size are 11-12.5, which essentially means they‚Äôre a size 12.5. If you‚Äôve ever had a foot, you know something a SIZE AND A HALF BIGGER than what you normally wear is going to be too big. These feel like they‚Äôd be awesome if they came in my size but they don‚Äôt; they come in one of like four different sizes. If you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones, this is the slipper for you. If, like me, you got lost in the shuffle (npi), you‚Äôll want to move on. You might be ok if they‚Äôre just a size bigger but I don‚Äôt know, these are pretty big. I‚Äôd say whatever the max size is they‚Äôre true to that size.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I‚Äôm a little upset at the arbitrary sizing of these things because they seem like they‚Äôd be perfect if they actually came in regular sizes. If I wore a 12.5 I‚Äôd give them five stars.<br /><br />And to think I ordered them TWICE because they didn‚Äôt even show up the first time‚Ä¶"
2.0,the silver lining wore off and is now turning my finger green
2.0,Es muy frajil
2.0,"Very misleading description on the vest!<br />Vest is way too small to be an adult size vest.<br />Could not even get my arms in the vest. Also, it is extremely thin and not at all durable.<br />Wouldn‚Äôt last for more that a couple times wearing. Very cheaply made."
2.0,"This came with a broken leather part within the chain strap. Also, the workmanship is not the greatest. I also purchased another bag from Amazon that looks very similar but slightly more expensive which was a lot more higher end looking than this bag. Even if the strap were not broken, the strap from this bag looked cheap and uncomfortable."
2.0,"not at all what the picture leads you to believe it is, smaller and not tied"
2.0,I did not like these.  The fabric has holes in them which allows the tip of your unit to poke through those holes.  Not comfortable.
2.0,"the quality is good, but the bag is very small and not practical at all"
2.0,My five year old had to have this hat and I caved in. It fits very small. In fact my three year old has stolen it from her. It also developed a hole bear the seam after a few wears. I will not buy another flipeez hat in the future.
2.0,These are cute as I expected but they seemed to come up a little bit on the smaller side. I was able to get my foot in but it was a tighter fit. I have fatter feet so I guess these are not wide foot friendly.
2.0,"It looks fine BUT it smells AUFUL!!! It gives me a headache. Also. Mine didn‚Äôt come with a hole punch like it said it would<br /><br />Edit after a few weeks, the smell has gone away"
2.0,The dress was to short my wife
2.0,I was looking for a large chunky sweater and this came up. It is not that. It's see through like most other womens' clothing. The Medium was supposed to be large enough from other reviews however it was too small. The fabric was very soft though.
2.0,"very adorable design, just like in picture, but back stick broke off :( bought another pair with different design, broke off as well :( only lasted about 2 weeks each :( spent so much money for nothing."
2.0,"Good cane for the price, if it wasn't broken.  The head was broken in two and the shaft didn't screw into the cane properly."
2.0,"Upper fit was good, but was way too short! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7"
2.0,"Ok. You can fix a poorly-shaped, droopy costume hat with some duct tape on the inside in about 2min. But I'm not going to re-sew the patch into the middle of the crown. Do better."
2.0,"Looking like so poor, don't looking a jewlery"
2.0,"Bracelets rin very small, definitely not for men. I will to my students."
2.0,The wristband is terrible will not clasp close.
2.0,"Lots of fabric, felt a little like a costume and was very king!"
2.0,The quality was not as was suggested
2.0,"I wasn‚Äôt too fond of this. I didn‚Äôt expect fabric to feel so cheap. I bought this for the purpose of warmth and comfort, definitely will not keep you warm. Wore it once and never did again"
2.0,No tummy control. More like a think silky panty that is high waisted
2.0,The necklace was nice but the earrings were just to small for what I was looking for.
2.0,It was a little too small. But the price was really good on it so I'm not complaining. I hang it up in my car for God to watch over me. Great quality and they are very strong. You can sleep in them and everything. I'd buy more.
2.0,I‚Äôm super disappointed. They said 0-35 months and they are swimming on my 8 month old. Super sad cuz I was really excited about these.
2.0,This definitely doesn't lay off the shoulder like presented in the image.
2.0,"No es a tama√±o, tienes que ordenar 1-2 tallas m√°s grandes"
2.0,Fits a bit small and does not hang well. material stretches out and looks cheap. I would pass on this if had the option again. I was disappointed
2.0,"The material is a super shiny material, thought they would be more softer. They run very small! I bought a medium and they are more like an x-small, they were even too tight on my sister who wears a small."
2.0,"Ordered these in a 3xl just cause I'm 66.  You know how EVERYTHING sags at this age!  Anyways I am a true 2xl but figured a little more room for the coopers(as in coopers droop).  Well not only are these similar in fit to an XL at least on me, they are very short waisted in that they ride low on the hips.  More for a younger man not an older man.  Seems to weird to me to send under wear back so I'll deep six'em and look for something else.<br /> stay safe"
2.0,I was disappointed in the hoodie.  I purchased it for my grandson's birthday.  He's a Predators fan and liked the gift.  When I saw him wearing it a few days later it was flopping in the breeze around him.  It is very lightweight. He couldn't zip it (and neither could I); after many attempts my son finally was able to zip it for him.  The hood is only for decorative purposes.  it has no tie under chin or anyway to keep it secure on his head.  I would not recommend purchasing it.
2.0,"I ended up returning this shirt.  It was strangely constructed & did not fit me well.  I liked the fabric.  It was soft & a good weight & the color was very pretty.  The shirt itself was sewn well & I think it would have worn well if it weren't so oddly put together.  The fabric wasn't see-through, even when stretched.  I was surprised that I did not like it actually.  I am an hourglass & generally like wrap styles & love this stretchy fabric because it can usually adjust to the difference in my measurements & still look nice.  I'm 5'2&#34; & 134 lbs, 40 bust, 28 waist, & 39 hips.  I bought the wine color in large (12/14).  I knew that my chest was over the stated measurement for the size, but I can generally get away with it if there's stretch in the fabric & plus there was a review stating that it was good for busty women.  In this case, I wasn't comfortable with the neckline because the top part of the &#34;wrap&#34; wasn't actually attached to the rest of the shirt on the long side--just on the shoulder & the side seam.  That would make this shirt great as a nursing shirt, but not so great if you're trying to push the limits.  I couldn't get it arranged so that I was covered & not have either a super high neckline or a weird fabric roll from the underside of the top part of the wrap.  So, the top wasn't at all flattering & I'd be worried about accidental exposure.  On top of that, the waist wasn't at all fitted.  The sizing chart did not give a waist measurement, but I was expecting it to be more form fitting.  There was so much extra material that the ruching was all bagged out around my middle."
2.0,Nice idea for Halloween socks.  Material is ok but quality is not great and the imagery is subpar!
2.0,"I love the design of these pieces, however, the gem portion doesn't screw in properly which has resulted in me losing all 6 heads. I reached out to seller via email to see if I just got a bad batch or if this is a usual ocurance and have not heard back. Bummer."
2.0,"Sent it back. Seams are not finished, they are serged. Fabric is a very thin t-shirt type. Great return policy!"
2.0,It needs more even snaps on there
2.0,"I‚Äôm actually a big patron fan so this pains me to say this but, these were less than impressive. The size I got should have fit perfect like the shirts but instead they ended up very low rise. The plumber had arrived. The top is a string instead of an elastic band which also means to tighten them you have to meet the muffin man. Definitely not ideal for"
2.0,"Band keeps coming off. Love the color just wish it didn't unhook and come off. Not using it any more, went back to my other one."
2.0,average only.
2.0,Straps break easily...
2.0,"Really dull colors, fabric has no vibrant colors as shown. Fabric is somewhat see-through, might want to wear a slip underneath."
2.0,Wore them for a week and the gold furnished color was gone
2.0,I would not recommend buying this gaiter. Slips off my nose fairly easily.
2.0,Sad. Purse is adorable but she whe Changing batteries for the lightning parts/wiring came in unsoldered  I tried to fix but was unsuccessful. Best part about Of the purse is that it light up with out that flare is just a small purse.
2.0,"I bought three other Jerzee's hooded sweatshirts sized XL and they fit perfectly.  For some reason this one fit much tighter, more like a size smaller.  Disappointed, really liked the color."
2.0,My 11 yr old is very tiny but tall. The 9-14 size is WAY TO SHORT..I have no idea how this designer even thinks this is normal size
2.0,Fit way to big
2.0,I wear a size 10 pants. I decided to size up to the large which states is pants size 10-12. They dig into my sides! They are comfy and I assume would be more so if they were the correct fit. I‚Äôm going to try ordering the next size up and hope they fit better.
2.0,"No stretch in the fabric. I've order this brand before, and they have never been like this."
2.0,Much smaller than it looks in the picture
2.0,"I wear a medium top, and size 10 pants.  I usually wear Medium dresses but I ordered a Large because i thought better to wrap it tight than not at all.  Well-This dress although wrapped enough to cover the bits- it didn't close enough to cover the &#34;down stairs&#34;  if I dared to walk or if a small breeze came blowing through.<br /><br />The pattern is beautiful and it seems like a quality dress but I'll have to lose 15+lbs before it'll fit!"
2.0,"Loved this flannel however, the first time I washed it, no drying."
2.0,My husband tried ordered this costume in a size Large and the belt would not fit around his waist (he wears size 34 waist pants) and the hat was extremely small. He does not have a small head but this hat would not even fit our teen son. For this price I would expect it to be sized correctly. The pants and coat do fit and are not too tight.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt slouch like it looks
2.0,Image doesn't correctly convey how small the bracelet is and the clasp did not work so I returned this product.
2.0,"Much smaller than depicted. The chain was tangled and I was not able to get it straightened out. So: Can't wear it. Pass on this one, people!"
2.0,Sizing off. I ordered an XL. It fits as a XXL Long. Not worth the trouble to return / re-order (as god knows what size I actually could wear).
2.0,I was so exited about these outfits as my little loves trucks. Unfortunately it was to small on him and the material is verrrrrrry thin. I could see his diaper print through the material. Item was returned.
2.0,Put it on the first time and it ripped
2.0,"I‚Äôm a size xxs and 00, yet this was too tight on me. It was labeled medium but it looks more like for tweens, not adults. Have two stars because the lace pattern is so nice but it‚Äôs unwearable."
2.0,"I wear masks all the time but this one is really hard to breath through, wore it for about 10 minutes and then went back to disposable ones."
2.0,They do not fit an adult and cannot be adjusted.
2.0,Hats look better online.
2.0,This bag is so small... Almost useless. The quality is great though hence the extra star
2.0,this bag is beautiful but it's a little heavy for me. If i would can return.
2.0,It's like a tight tank top...nothing compressed about it...think I was looking for something to hold form..
2.0,The only stretch is in the waist band itself and it not much. If you have truly thick thighs/hips and a booty it might not fit as expected or at all.  I Usually size L or XL and i couldnt get it on over my butt.
2.0,Color is off and it‚Äôs see through. Also size is like an XS and not an M
2.0,"The pendant is great, but the &#34;cord&#34; provided for it is Horrible! I had to throw away the cord because it feels like a plastic and is very stiff. The pendent didn't fit right on the pendant. I still have been unable to wear the pendant considering that I have to find a necklace/cord. The pendant is beautiful and very shiny which I do love."
2.0,The metal part is too long causing it to not sit on my wrist very well.
2.0,The cardigan had a hole by the tag. I had to return it. It was a lightweight jersey material and was just what I wanted.
2.0,"It was a really nice piece but it soon became infected after I put it in, it took a couple days for me to notice and about a week for a keyloid or absess to form. I have a bump with pus."
2.0,Quit working after being used for 15 months.
2.0,"I've had these for more than a year, and my biggest complaint--starting 3-5 months from my purchase--is that these shirt stays don't STAY in place.<br /><br />By the end of a few hours or an entire work day the length adjusted to originally moves; therefore, not keeping optimal tension on the shirt being pulled down.<br /><br />Wearing these can sometimes be painful as they hair is pulled, but the straps are not visible even when wearing slim slacks.<br /><br />Final Note: Look around for potentially better products. Also, wanted to solve issue with seller before having to leave a review--so customer service is LACKING."
2.0,I was some what disappointed in the quality in this Hat can. I realized it was made in China.  The cheaply made product is not worth what you pay!  If you were to take on a trip good luck it's to flimsy can't believe it made it on delivery here.  it works if you keep it in your closet but the price of it is way to high.
2.0,I did not realize the end was plastic and bends easily.
2.0,"I really wanted to Like this dress, but the fabric felt like I was wearing a plastic bag, and it‚Äôs measurements on its size chart are way off. Literally feels like plastic."
2.0,"The fabric is pretty nice and thick, but they‚Äôre too small. I usually wear an XL, so I‚Äôd recommend sizing up if you choose to purchase. They‚Äôre not high waisted on me and roll down every time I sit. Very annoying. 2 stars."
2.0,"it a bit snug but the worst of it is that it is useless without the filters which they only give u 2. the filter part is so thin that u can blow right through it which means u need a filter, ""their filter"" that's the catch. no mention on how long the filter would last or were they washable etc etc etc ....."
2.0,"Cheaply made, stitching is crooked and bunched."
2.0,"Unfortunately, these boots do not come up to the standard of the UGG brand. For one, the fit is very different. Specifically, the ankle and calf are much too snug, especially for wearing leggings inside. Stick with the Classic Tall version."
2.0,"Was twisted and had to returned it,also the mesh or chain mail was too large, but it if you like it large I would recommend"
2.0,"X large was ordered.  Fit like a medium size gloved. Can‚Äôt ware, stitching started to unravel when trying to put on.  Not sure if I can get a refund but I‚Äôll try."
2.0,I had to return this. I bought a Large and it fit like a Small.  It's a shame because it's very cute. Looks like the picture exactly.
2.0,I ordered the large but they are too small.  Have another older sun sleve that is a large and it fits fine.  Now I have to pay $6.00 plus to mail them back.  Bummer....
2.0,"Very cheaply made, not worth what I paid for it my grandson was so excited about it until he opened it and seen how cheap it was and it did not fit on his arm."
2.0,"This sweatshirt is a cute design and nice fabric, but it runs REALLY small."
2.0,Didn't receive this tie - I received a different Maple Leaf tie but since it was a gift I didn't have time to return it. I wanted this one but got an ugly white one.
2.0,"Worked well for a while, but then unexpectedly it flooded when surfing (didn't hit it on my board or anything). Totally destroyed. Fortunately, I was able to return it."
2.0,"The dress was pretty and fit great, but the pattern is poorly done. The pattern was EXTREMELY pixelated and looked like it was zoomed in on a computer and printed. The pattern also started over in the middle of the dress, so it went from one flower to a different flower in the middle instead of at the seam. It looked like the pattern was too short for the dress, and it looked terrible."
2.0,"Maybe it's just my body shape but I just had to laugh as soon as I looked in the mirror with this on.  It's made of scuba suit material which didn't really bother me but the cut and shape was terrible.  I have an athletic build, 36DD if that helps anyone.  I returned it."
2.0,I ordered an xl and it is more like a medium.
2.0,"Not a beefy, full-grain bridle leather belt like you‚Äôd hope it to be.  It a facsimile of a good belt."
2.0,The glasses are made very cheap and look kinda silly. Package came on time though and undamaged.
2.0,Theyre all the same color. Thumbs down for that.
2.0,Very thin fabric. Kept it because it would cost as much to return as I paid
2.0,Wayyy too large. A lot bigger than I expected and looked too cartoonish so I returned
2.0,"Was shipped faster than the original date, outside package well done and protected.  Upon opening the envelope, I found a gift box but when I opened the box I found a small 1.5""x2"" envelope with the necklace inside all tangled and  knotted up which took me over an hour to get all the knots out. The heart is  pretty but a lot smaller than the picture makes it appear.  Chain so delicate and clasp so tiny it would  be difficult for a normal person to put on themselves or someone else.  Very easy to break the chain due to it being so delicate. Chain in ad states a length of 17 inches but when I measured it , I barely got it to reach the 16"" mark. It looks more like something a child would wear but is far to delicate .  I am not sure whether I will spend the money to return it or just keep it and call  it a loss. It is not something I would ever buy for myself as if it ever caught on something, it would not be worth repairing if it could even be done."
2.0,Not so good quality
2.0,Loved it but the fabric is SO thin. Already have a small tear in it after only owning it for a month. For the price paid I would expect tougher fabric. Disappointing.
2.0,"Super cute, but tarnished within two weeks and is now unwearable. Bummed. I guess you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Disappointed, after the first used the thread begin to come out‚Ä¶ because of the price I paid, I was expecting something better."
2.0,I'm 62 with cataracts (mild so far) and headlight driving at night is an issue. Certain headlights are much more bothersome so I assume it is the  type that is more the problem.  These glasses mildly (at best) helped with the glare.  Would still wear them because a little help is better than none at all.
2.0,"Smells very, very bad. I have tried many techniques to rid it of the chemical smell to no avail. Have not been able to use the purse due to the odor. I do really like the look and size of it, just cannot stand the smell!"
2.0,They was good and got but did not day on if you look down.
2.0,"Okay pearl necklace, it's a little to short in length."
2.0,"Inconsistent sizing, one is way too tight, short on the sleeves, and tight in shoulders. Other two fit comfortably, nice sleeve length, loose enough that it is flattering but still close to skin"
2.0,"Are great fit and comfortable to use while working. However, are not as durable as thought would be and already had to throw a pair away that weren't even a month old. So on that note I won't be ordering them again."
2.0,"Kind of cloudy, unlike pic online"
2.0,"I returned the. They dimmed the lights and reduced glare,  but in low light areas were to dark so they didn't work for me."
2.0,"So excited to receive....then got it, it did not fit at all! Way to small! I ordered my size. Size charts need to be available precisely with product. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll order again from Towallmark new Women clothing."
2.0,The shape was too plain for any face...
2.0,Loved it but it broke after 5 days
2.0,I gave this dress to my teenage niece. The dress was order super big on purpose and it came super small.
2.0,one works great. other one doa
2.0,It seems very pretty but the pearls are way too big.
2.0,"I bought about 60 nursing shorts from Amazon because I wanted to compare items and see what I liked best. I bought all three colors of this product and sent all three back!<br /><br />It might look cuter on a pregnant person...but I did not look cute at all on my 3 weeks post partum body. It just looked like this really weird hanging cloth in front it me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-cute buttons<br />-access to breast for nursing<br /><br />Cons:<br />- when you're standing in front of the mirror, it just looks frumpy and not attractive<br />- looks bizarre on a post partum body<br /><br />Ultimately, I would not buy again."
2.0,I have had this for about six weeks. I love this watch. The reason I did not give it five stars is because sometime in the past day or so the crystal fell out and got lost. After only six weeks the crystal should not fall out. I will miss this watch.
2.0,"After only 3 days (even removed when I washed my hands, showered and slept) the ring was so tarnished I no longer wear it."
2.0,As a watch I think it‚Äôs probably so so but it‚Äôs difficult to read and the band must be designed for a ten year old. I‚Äôd pass.
2.0,The dress style & length was great. But the bust area was slightly off & the material is really see- through!
2.0,Liked them but they are very thin and look a bit weird with regular shoes
2.0,Not what I expected really small for my 5 yr old boy. I got it for school during Art Class
2.0,"I really love how these cufflinks look and feel.  The only problem is that like others here, only 1 of the pair works well.  I tried different sleeves throughout the week and it appears to be just the cufflink, nothing I did made a difference."
2.0,The beads are gnarled.  It appears that they are too close.  There is no wiggle room for them and they do not hang straight.
2.0,Has no shape do not like the material not at all what I expected
2.0,Didn't look on me like is does in the picture. Maybe my boobs are too big. The rubber fit right under my breasts and not at the waist.
2.0,"I had high hopes for this bathing suit, but it looked absolutely terrible on me, it was not flattering at all. It didn‚Äôt do anything for anything for tummy control and I don‚Äôt have that much of an issue, but still some since giving birth. I‚Äôm a small chested woman and this bathing suit didn‚Äôt do me any favors either. I felt very boxy and ridiculous in this suit and I will not be wearing it. I‚Äôll probably donate it. Maybe it would flatter a curvier woman better than it did me."
2.0,It was very tight but the satin fabric was good and soft. I wanted to return n get the right size but missed the return deadline. Its just lying in my wardrobe now.
2.0,These tarnished and the cz fell out of a few of them.  Clearly these are not stainless because stainless does not fade.  Cheap construction
2.0,"Very cute necklace, well detailed. EDIT: The necklace turned my skin green within 2 weeks. The manatee is starting to tarnish. So disappointed."
2.0,they were what you expect way beyond cheap
2.0,I ordered the pink dress.... the dress I received is red. Very red.
2.0,"It looks well made and it fitted well. I'm 5'4"" 177pounds and I bought size Large<br />My complaint it's that it says no transparency in the description and it is totally see through. It's only for beachwearing"
2.0,"I had gotten this as a gift for a friend, and she wasn't terribly satisfied.<br />She said it was cheaply made, and the second day she wore it, a few of the studs had fallen off.<br />I told her I would get an exchange, but she was quite annoyed and refused to buy again from this seller."
2.0,Extremely small and i ordered up 2 sizes
2.0,Fits small.  Order bigger
2.0,This product doesn‚Äôt work for glasses. Tried it several times and my glasses still fog up while wearing a mask. ‚òπÔ∏è
2.0,"The sleeves / arms are extremely tight, and doesn't seem to match the sizing of the rest of the garment.  The material is a very thick polyester, much like a Halloween costume.  I love the idea of it, but the sizing and material is not what was expected."
2.0,"Shrunk up to less than half of the size after washing, and I did not even put it in the dryer. I never even got to wear it. I had to throw it out."
2.0,Not really very attractive cold es seem dull
2.0,"Loved these for our 4 year old when down at the pool. They fit well, were comfortable, non-slip and low profile. However, by the 3rd use they started to show severe wear and by 4th use they were unusable. It's a shame because they initially seemed to be a great product. If we got a season out of them I'd be ok with it, but 4 uses is not acceptable. I will note that customer service was very good and they accepted the refund of severely-damaged shoes and issued credit without a hassle (I sent them back only to provide proof of their condition). But they need to greatly improve durability."
2.0,Purchased this for my 3yr old and it‚Äôs too big on her. It fits me better than her.
2.0,"Wanted to like this but it runs at least two sizes small. Couldn‚Äôt even get it on. I‚Äôm usually a M in shirts, dress size 6 in women‚Äôs clothing. This looked like an XS off the rack. It‚Äôs not very stretchy either."
2.0,"I would have expected it to be in a box verses a cheap plastic pouch, with a paper tag.  Something you would find at Claire's...."
2.0,"Handsome, more that adequate time keeper, but very difficult to read because hands don't contrast against the watch face.  I returned.  Return experience typically good."
2.0,"I am giving these jeans 2 stars, because they are comfortable, but that's about the only positive I can say about them. They also look fine, but the problems are too numerous to overlook<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The material is super thin and stretchy. I don't mind clothes that stretch, but these stretch unlike any jeans I've over owned - including ones that advertise stretch. Those will stretch a little... these you can stretch 2-4 inches in any direction. So basically a size 34 will probably fit you if you usually wear 35 probably  36. I wear between 33 and 34, and these are big on me.<br />2. Since you can only pick size (34) I happen to get a 34-30 which is unfortunately too short for me. Not sure what they are thinking just advertising the width... especially online where you cannot try them on first.<br />3. The material is so thin, it's highly unlikely they will last.<br />4. The stitching had already missed spots and loose threads in multiple areas (nothing that would compromise the integrity, but it doesn't inspire confidence or quality when you see that).<br /><br />Overall I cannot recommend these, unless you really like thin jeans that are super stretchy and the company corrects/shows both the width and length when selecting sizes."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. However I did not like the neckline, it was very long, and I felt like the quality wasn‚Äôt very good for the price. Ended up returning."
2.0,I loked the colors but was disappointed with the size. I am 5'9. They were too short and thin. I returned
2.0,"XXL was way too small.......  Tiny, Tiny......  I had to return and would not buy this brand again."
2.0,Did not fit my fitbit
2.0,No difference in pain levels.
2.0,"Their photo does not look like patent leather but it is, so the straps are rigid and uncomfortable. The description only states faux leather, just like their photo. It's too bad because he sole is great."
2.0,Art: The quality of the printing on this is sub standard. Fit: Runs small and the sleeves are less unisex men‚Äôs and more akin to a ladies‚Äô garment; a longer cropped sleeve style. Don‚Äôt recommend this at all.
2.0,Was very pretty except for when I opened it the charm was already off of the daughter necklace and the daughter chain was broken no problem I fixed it with a pliers but it broke two more times within 30 minutes and NOT from aggressive wear. Too bad it falls apart so easily my daughter loves the idea of the necklaces and it‚Äôs very pretty
2.0,This would fit a child.  I am 6 feet tall and bald - not an overly large head.  Did not fit. I wish it did
2.0,"This shirt just didn't fit me right, didn't look right on me.  It would look better on a slim girl with a bust size of 32-34.  I'm a 38 and WISH I WAS A 32.  A lot of cute clothes do not fit me right because of my unproportionate bust size.  This shirt is really cute I think and very stylish."
2.0,"Don‚Äôt bother, it looks like a slap bracelet with sequins üòë"
2.0,"Was not impressed with these earrings when they arrived.  Nothing wrong with them, but I was looking for a pair that had more of the &#34;oxidized&#34; effect.  I am returning to continue my search."
2.0,Cool necklace but the finish wore off in one week. Returned for a refund.
2.0,I ordered the dress for my son's wedding. It was not flattering.  Made me look fat. Did not fit like the photo on Amazon.
2.0,"this did not fit well at all, i actually cut out the inside insert with the underwire and it actually worked much better for me that way."
2.0,This is very very small.  Not sure what scarf would fit through this... maybe one of those skinny ones from the 1970s.
2.0,"Asked for replacement as the first bag had its strap attached incorrectly. Sadly, the second bag had the exact same problem!! So ill be returning both of them!"
2.0,"These earrings can be used for costume purposes, but it looks cheap for every day use (it's plastic not brass hardware). Also, the clip on is not an adjustable screw, but a thin line. So if your earlobe is thin or if you move around a lot, it will definitely fall off."
2.0,it broke the second time I wore it.
2.0,The material is too clingy and I had problems putting it on over a shirt.
2.0,"The fabric of this long sleeved T was unpleasant to the touch and the body. Altho is was labeled 100% cotton, it felt rough. If it had been soft like other slub knit cotton t-shirts I own, I would have ordered several. Instead I returned it."
2.0,"While this jacket is lightweight and warm, it did not work out.  It sheds constantly, and my son was always covered in feathers.  It looks like he's been handling a cat.  I believe that it is made out of leftover tiny feathers.  Plus, the material is very shiny (think garbage bag shiny), so it was a little odd for my son.  It's too late to return the item now, so I feel like I've wasted my money.  We're replacing it with a better known brand of jacket."
2.0,"Despite the band being adjustable, the flowers are just FAR TOO LARGE for my tiny wrists. Such a bummer"
2.0,Yes they were slim. The frame seemed flimsy. The colored frame was distracting to my vision. I was looking for a pair of reading glasses to wear at the end of my nose after cataract surgery. These were not it. Sent back yesterday.
2.0,Even used the size chart but still the XL was more like a 2X.
2.0,I purchased the mermaid style which in the heading says Deluxe however I didn't read the description and it does say it's nylon which means it's the original Style so it's not the deluxe as stated and I was looking for the softer one
2.0,These earrings were a gift for my daughter for her 6th birthday. They came packaged very nicely in a velvet box.  When we put them in the first time one didn‚Äôt close great but I chose to hold off on returning them. We wore them two days and woke up to find the earring that wouldn‚Äôt close great broken in two pieces. These looked very pretty but ultimately were very poor quality.
2.0,Made for stretched ear lobes
2.0,"When it stated bottle, I thought it was in a bottle. Not the shape of a bottle. You should clarify that."
2.0,Cute and for the price I guess I shouldn't be expecting the world. But after one wash all the tassel fell off.
2.0,"Super cute top but runs really, really small."
2.0,"The look great and the quality is good, but the big problem is they won't float my glasses.  I have 3 pair of Rx sunglasses and the only one that won't sink to the bottom of the 5 gallon bucket weighs in at 1 ounce.  The other two weighing 1.2 and 1.3 ounces go right to the bottom 5 gallon bucket"
2.0,Wasn't big on the quality so I gave it away.
2.0,Ok but not good fabric  .
2.0,"The mask has 2 large pleats on each side which really messes up the squirrel design.  No matter how hard I try to move it around, you can't see the squirrels head, thus you cannot make out what design is on the mask.  Other masks have more smaller pleats so the mask lays nicely.  I will have to take the pleats out and redo it but it may tear since the material is silky (which I didn't expect).  It's a shame because the squirrel is adorable and the price was reasonable."
2.0,I was really sad because this necklace was so cute on. But it broke after the first time I wore it sadly. To be fair it is only a 7 dollar necklace so it is what it is. Just don‚Äôt expect to keep it for long if you purchase this.
2.0,"This is my 5th or 6th Vera Bradley scarf of this model, and while I love the newest pattern, I was very disappointed to find that the quality isn't what it used to be. The material of the scarf feels scratchier, not as soft as previous items of this type I've bought from the brand. As of Sep 2017, the VB site says that they &#34;updated fabrication to viscose produced from bamboo for a softer handfeel&#34;, but I don't believe it. It's still rayon, and I'm disappointed in how it feels. I'm concerned that having it round my neck all day would be itchy."
2.0,I don't even know where to begin to lambaste this product.<br /><br />1)The clasp system is very pretentious and not functional. You need to be a contortionist to clasp the rear clasps since you have to find fabric to clamp to.<br />2)The clasps do not clasp well to thin fabrics. I found myself having to bunch up the fabric plus add my undershirt to get a grip on the shirt.<br />3)The clasp system is HORRIBLE<br /><br />2 stars for the elastic bands not pulling my leg hair.
2.0,"I really liked the necklace out of the box, a nice long chain and a very pretty pendant.  However, the first day I wore it out to dinner and didn't feel it get caught on anything, but the chain broke and I felt it slide into my shirt.  The body of the chain broke, so it probably isn't worth fixing.  I'll look for another chain, but kind of disappointing because the price now basically doubles to make it wearable.  Also, the stone is set somewhat twisted in the gold setting, I'm concerned the stone will fall out eventually since it isn't squarely in the ""bracket"" holding it."
2.0,I love the boots but they have an odor like they were just painted. I asked a few friends to smell them and they agreed. Is this all of the boots or just the pair l received. I need an answer before l return them
2.0,This dress isn‚Äôt flattering fit for anyone busty. I‚Äôm also long waisted and the waist was definitely cut for short waisted girl. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 and 36 long legs. The length was the only good part of this dress. Overall just an awkward fit. Probably suited for someone shorter despite the length and or as a bathing suit cover up.
2.0,This product looks like it's sized for a toddler. I have a slender 12 year old daughter and I got a small since it's women sized....looks like she is going belly dancing. Not happy.
2.0,didnt fit as expected. i give it to a friend
2.0,THE SIZE RUNS SMALL IF IT IS ORDERED IT SHOULD BE ORDERED TWO SIZE LARGER.
2.0,They weren‚Äôt as long as I they stated and were really thin. They also came with a super long string loose. They also were small. Really disappointed
2.0,"does not appear to be polarized, I have  a pair of polarized sunglasses and these clip-ons are not in the ballpark. fit over prescription aviator glasses is eally poor."
2.0,I purchased the pink and blue pair and was very excited to receive them. Once I got them I tried them on and they were cute. I did notice the label on the lense of both pairs and it will not come off. Why sell glasses with the label on the lense if it doesn't come off? Will be returning!
2.0,"Mine did not arrive in a box, so my slippers were a little smushed and wrinkled. For 21 dollars though it's not a big deal. They are light, they are comfy, and the suede feels nice. We'll see if the stitching holds up. I wear a size 12 shoe and the XXL was recommended and they were right.<br /><br />UPDATE: Stitching is now coming apart and the slipper is literally falling apart. It lasted a few months. I wasn't expecting ultra high quality but it probably should've lasted a little longer especially since I only wear them around the house."
2.0,"Glad I ordered a XL. I'm 5'5"" and 165lbs. Said a large would fit. No way. XL is snug. Material already had some pulls in material when received. I was able to fix myself. Material feels like brillo pad. Looks ok. I don't think I will order again from this company. Seems cheaply made."
2.0,Was nice. The chest was too law. May consider buying next time
2.0,"Sized smaller. Quality not great, did not wash well."
2.0,"I needed both the inner lining, this only had the outter."
2.0,"The black part of the pants feel soft, almost like a microfiber.  The gray part is a rougher feeling fabric. Because of the dark seam that goes through the middle of the pants, it outlines your labia (giving you &#34;camel toe&#34;).  Because there is no specific front side or back side (there is no extra fabric for a butt) the pants in the back will dip very low and the pants in the front will go above your belly button.  These pants are constantly sliding down, so you can either have them falling off or have a constant camel toe.  There is no elastic or anything in the waist band to hold them up.  These would work for just lounging around, but don't try doing any kind of actual physical activity (like yoga...which is what these pants are advertised for), because they will keep sliding down.  These are definitely my least favorite pair of leggings."
2.0,Returned to short. Had to get something else didn't have next size available.
2.0,It's great but too small. I love the color but can't wear it.üòî
2.0,"these did not fit at all, my 12 month old had a wide & chubby foot. Never used them."
2.0,"This is ridiculous. I am 5‚Äô10 and this top is entirely too short for my torso. Top that with the awful side slits, and you are hanging out on each side. The model in the photo must be very short because there is no other way this fits like the photo. It‚Äôs also very see-through and I do not like layering up clothing that isn‚Äôt designed for winter. Not happy with this top at all."
2.0,"I returned it to Amazon....to big for my 5 foot petite frame, plus to heavy"
2.0,Super cute septum ring. But it turned my nose green!! Really disappointed.
2.0,Waist and Bust were a good fit. Arms and thigh/hip area were tight. According to the measurements they should fit and have a little room. Afraid if I bend id split the seam. :(
2.0,Pants were way shorter than they should have been. They were described as petite but they came in about 4 in above where they should
2.0,"It is pretty. I have not worn it yet--so I'm not sure how it will wear. I will have to use something to hold it in place. What I liked least was what I believed to be deceptive advertising.  I spent $20.00 to purchase what I saw in the picture--to be delivered 1 day before a dance. When it arrived, it was only 1/2 of the object. No where in the ad did it say you had to order 2 to get the whole thing.  I did go ahead order the other half, but there was no way to get it in time for the dance, thus, the reason I haven't worn it."
2.0,First pair I got the clasp broke on one earring just after the return window closed. I really liked them so I bought another pair. The return window closed last week and today I lost the stone out of one. I really like them but not having much luck.
2.0,"Broke after a few months. I liked it a lot, but it has no use broken."
2.0,Had to return. Followed the sizing guide and it was basically a laundry bag over me.
2.0,It works as intended. Over priced.
2.0,XL but is very small for me. Normally I buy L or 40.
2.0,The legs rode up quite a bit just trying it on. Got a couple to compare and liked another better.
2.0,Much smaller than expected. Made for super small wrists
2.0,They're pretty but they re bigger than I expected.
2.0,CHEAP MATERIAL.
2.0,Not nearly as vibrant as the photo.  To be expected i guess.
2.0,They are not true to size. Will need to up at least 2 sizes as I am sure they will shrink in the wash. Otherwise I like the softness.
2.0,Material is cheap. They don‚Äôt fit as expected!
2.0,Material very thin and size runs small. I ordered an exact pair from a different maker and these were subpar to the others.
2.0,"I was really excited about these, but they look super awkward on. I havent yet found a way to wear them and make them look okay."
2.0,Def not the color in the pic it‚Äôs a darker pink in person
2.0,"It has a cute design, however the clasp isn‚Äôt great, doesn‚Äôt stay on. I have to constantly adjust it, it‚Äôs too short in the back for a 4 year old. It‚Äôs a waste of money for me."
2.0,"Nice jacket, but sizes run VERY small.  XL was more like a medium.  I ordered an XL to fit loosely, and it was too small."
2.0,I got what I paid for! The glasses were obviously a brighter color and have been spay painted black. The color underneath bleed through. I will have to repaint them to make them a solid color and wearable.
2.0,These did not stay wrapped around the back of my shoes. Therefore useless. I tried and tried to no avail.
2.0,Ordered it 2 size larger and it still was slightly small -still like it!
2.0,Cute mittens. The strap serves no purpose. Still too big for my 2.5 year old. Going back to get something more functional.
2.0,"The quality is ok, but not the best. You can make it look cute, but it‚Äôs not warm. If I would‚Äôve been aware of the quality, I wouldn‚Äôt have bought, truthfully‚Ä¶"
2.0,It ripped and the zipper broke
2.0,"Beautiful pattern, but it's way too small!  After reading some of the reviews I decided to order an XXL instead of my normal XL.  This ended up to be closer to a Medium & I am returning it.  I'd purchase again if the manufacturer were to get their sizing issue corrected."
2.0,frustrating to put in
2.0,I wanted for my birthday but it was too big and too much material
2.0,"The softness and material were nice and well made. But the sizing is off. I bought a large and that‚Äôs what I usually buy, I would only be able to fit my body into this, if I got rid of my arms. This is definitely more like a small."
2.0,"Small, cheaply made for the price"
2.0,Nice material but over all wasn't the type or style of shorts I was expecting. Was a little loose where I wanted a more fitted style.
2.0,Child doesn't love them because the inside liners come out easily. He will rarely wear them.
2.0,Was great but already broke got a second one and it broke sooner than the first
2.0,Only can wear st home. Not for work.
2.0,"The dress was nicely made, fit perfect and was very flexible but the fabric is so rough I cannot wear it. I have sensitive skin so this did not work out even after washing several times in fabric softener. Very disappointing!"
2.0,Ran small and cheaply made.
2.0,These are extremely tiny stones.
2.0,Very disappointed with this purchase not worth the money I spent on it
2.0,Runs small.  Had to give it to my daughter<br />Very fitting  Shows all your curves<br />Not thrilled with the material
2.0,"This shirt is 100% polyester. It even says it on the box. I wore it and my body odor permeates into the shirt like any other polyester shirt. There is no copper for antimicrobial purposes in the shirt, just pure 100% polyester."
2.0,This dress is see thriugh. The fabric is thin and very poor quality.
2.0,"The top doesn't fit, I ordered a size up for good measure. No stretch at all"
2.0,Absolutely soft like all the other reviews stated.  I wore it right out of package without washing.  Third morning I woke up only to discover a hole in the front mid section.  NO idea how that happened!
2.0,"You get what you pay for.<br />Metal parts that latch/snap onto the watch head seem poorly designed. They look unfinished and when put against the black watch head look out of place. The latches don't feel secure when in place which made me worry that they may come undone during normal wear. Band and is too stiff and feel uncomfortable around the wrist, and the first loop, which is ""glued"" in place, is too close to the buckle which makes it very difficult to loop the band through."
2.0,"I love the earrings, they are stone, but the beads on the necklace are plastic."
2.0,Nifty colors but material too stiff even after washing.
2.0,Very stiff at the collar more like a shirt than a kimono
2.0,"This dress came and did not look ANYTHING like the photo. It was a very cheap material and I needed to return it to China which costs a lot, and I still have not received a refund. I will be looking for the sellers location moving forward because this has been disappointing and a major inconvenience. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere"
2.0,Polka dots are huge.
2.0,"The color was beautiful. I ordered it based on the same item I had ordered earlier in a different color. The item arrived with no labels, a different feel from the first purchase, and a different neck line. It appeared to be a substitution."
2.0,"Too narrow, not wide enough and no spring loaded hinges."
2.0,Tissue Paper THIN Fabric! Great for menopause. But not so great for cold nights.
2.0,They fit small. I wore them while working out and my junk kept falling out.
2.0,The yin and yang part was lost forever after 2 weeks.
2.0,I will give it to a petite friend. It looks like cascading pearls but in fact is just cloth beading.
2.0,"It's cute, and I wish it had fit, but too small and I'm only 120 lbs 5'4'', not comfortable to get on or off."
2.0,Good quality but run small
2.0,it was way to big
2.0,"These pants were made well, fabric nice and very soft inside. My daughter is very small, but this pant in a medium was too snug, no breathing room at all. Not worth sending back because you have to pay shipping to return, plus they deduct additional shipping from refund!  Go figure!<br />I'm going to remove fabric from size large that's way too big and add to the size medium that was way too small (sounds like a goldilocks conundrum!!!) Not worth returning because of the additional shipping fees"
2.0,"Very pretty but the straps broke on the first day wearing it.  The dress itself was gorgeous, but the straps were tiny cheap little strings."
2.0,This dress has this funky outlining.  It makes You look round<br />Wish I could if took it back in time.
2.0,"Too short, I'm 5 '7&#34; and hits way above the ankle; wish it were longer and more flattering."
2.0,My daughter used this item as a Halloween costume. She worded 2 sizes bigger than what she wears & it was still way to small.
2.0,A lil small
2.0,I liked it and comfortable but faded out fast
2.0,This umbrella is well made. It works properly. It does spin in light breeze even though we purchased the four water weights weighing close to 120 lbs. Disappointing The umbrella fabric in hunter green faded before I even had it paid for. I contacted seller immediately with no response. I would not purchase again.
2.0,"The men's size 11 is SMALLER than the men's size 10. I have the 10, and wanted one size bigger. I ordered 3 x 11's but have returned them and ordered the 12. Other than sizing issues, they are a very comfortable shoe. (to be clear, the 10 is labelled '10, and the 11 is labelled '11' but the 11 is about 3/8"" shorter than the 10.)"
2.0,"Size chart inaccurate.  The top too tight. The stripe too thin., and it looks very bad stripe. Fabric  cheap. I don't recommend ."
2.0,"Looks absolutely nothing like the photos! In fact it looks so different, I couldn't figure out if I ordered it and I thought maybe someone sent me a gift!"
2.0,"Cute bag poorly made. After one month of use, the black trim around the handles started peeling off."
2.0,"Very nice purse but small for someone who prefers big ones.<br />Last year the handle on this purse burst while I was out, I felt so embarrassed. Cheap purse. But it was very cute."
2.0,I ordered a large and I'm a size 12 and it was way too tired of my boobs
2.0,This is great for cool fall mornings definitely not a winter coat
2.0,"I have different brand visor and liked it so much that I wanted to purchase another one. I came across this brand and purchased one. The quality and functionality of it does not compare to the original one I bought.<br />What I like:<br />The bow gives it a nice look.<br />Portable since it folds.<br />Price is inexpensive.<br />What I don't like:<br />This one slips off my head. This is a pretty major negative (yes, it lost 3 stars because it!). What's the point of a hat if it doesn't stay on my head!?<br />The original brand that I bought works for my very straight slippery hair but it's also 5x the price!"
2.0,Looks pretty but smaller than expected! Not worth the amount I spent
2.0,This is cute but it's for very tiny people. I ordered even the largest size and it was incredibly small but pretty. Very disappointed.
2.0,Tried several different sizes - nice looking belt but not made for someone with wide hips!
2.0,"At its most fundamental, a watch must tell the time. And although this watch appears to work just fine - and probably keeps excellent time - you'll never know because the design is such that you can hardly read it. The hands look like a small mess of white in the center of a black disc. Believe me, if you need to see the time while you're driving, you WILL crash your car. So two stars for being well made, well packaged, a good price, and mechanically sound; but if you actually want to see the time, I'm afraid you're SOL."
2.0,"The arms fit my girlfriend well, she got a medium because she knew her arm length are longer than a small but now the shirt doesn't fit much like a crop top. Her only two complaints is that the crop top bunches up in between her neck and chest unzipping doesn't help with that and the shirt has a weird chemical smell out of the package."
2.0,"I have questions got other buyers of this bag. It's beautiful and I love the color and style, but I have concerns and questions.<br /><br />There are creases on the front of my bag and a sock looking outline on the back.  Did this happen with anyone else? I've posted pics.  Just wondering...<br />Absolutely love the color and style.<br />I'm giving a 2 because of the creases."
2.0,I ordered a L and fils like a small
2.0,"A little short for loose casual & the shoulder seams hang down to mid upper arm, kinda weird looking/feeling.  I got the black so not real noticeable. Since using for camping not returning."
2.0,Is too small from the top  my breast is not big and still too small for me
2.0,"Silver color wore off within a week.. The rest are fine, but I would not recommend this package."
2.0,"Twice I have ordered these ring , received the wrong size/asked for size 9 received size 6."
2.0,"This is a cute little &#34;princess&#34; outfit, but the sequins that spell out &#34;princess&#34; are very poorly put on.  As you can see by the picture, the letters are not put on in a straight line and some of the sequins are already coming off before it has even been worn or washed.  So I don't think the sequins are going to last long at all.  The tulle tutu part is also stitched very crooked.  The material is very thin, too, so it can be seen through.  The tutu is not fluffy and three tiered like the picture, so it looks very cheap.  Overall, a very poor quality.  I received this product at a discount for an honest review."
2.0,This necklace looked very small.The cross is really big and the long black chains gives it a different look tat i don't desire.
2.0,The glasses are mirrored. They are not see through like the picture shows. If you want red see through lens I suggest you purchase elsewhere.
2.0,"Very thin and cheap, not nice and thick like I thought they would be. They‚Äôre more like pantyhose."
2.0,"Wow, a pair of sunglasses that actually fit me. However the optics are pretty poor. A bit of distortion and a really weird effect when light is coming from the side or back. I thought my retina was coming detached with the blue like fading that was going on in my peripheral vision. Took the glasses off and no problem. Back on... bad."
2.0,We loved these for about 4 weeks and then they fell completely apart. My husband and I have Tevas and thought our 8yr old could get away with these. But it appears you get what you pay for. My son was super disappointed when these broke as he said they were very comfortable. Looks like we will be coughing up more money for a better quality sandal now.
2.0,Get what you pay for. Looks really cheap.
2.0,"material is fine, fit is terrible. its short and small"
2.0,"Photos and descriptions are NOT what you get when you order.  Black is fine BUT the Grey is an ugly taupe color and the pink is a flesh color that is awful.  It should be advertised as flesh color and taupe, NOT pink and grey.  UGLY! UGLY! I would have returned the products but I needed a new black band.  I will look for the colors to order from another manufacturer.  I am completely dissatisfied with two of the three bands.  I only gave the 2 stars for the black band."
2.0,"Like other reviewers- this jersey has an odd fit. Large upper and very tight, tiny elastic around waist. Im 5‚Äô5‚Äù and the jersey went past the bum and hit high thigh. Kinda like a long blouse youd wear w leggings. Nice fabric. Simply cut weird. Maybe a mans cut labeled for women??"
2.0,The bracelet turned greenish in color causing my granddaughters wrist to be green.
2.0,I love the idea of this keychain but sadly it broke apart only a week of having it. The red pepper fell off from the rest of the keychain and won‚Äôt stay back on
2.0,"I bought this to wear to a wedding and ended up wearing something else. For reference: I am 5'3"" - 140lbs - 34B chest with bigger hips. I ordered a Small (which is what I normally wear in more flowy dresses because I need the top to be fitted). The top was loose at the shoulders and under my arms and looked terrible. Then, the front of the dress was soooo short. Last, the material was not forgiving AT ALL. Very unflattering. It was just a mess all around on my body."
2.0,Not worth 1/2 the money it cost. I bought in blue and it's so dark you can't see the speedometer or clock or much of anything. They are a bit difficult to attach to me heavier plastic glasses. Will probably return.
2.0,"I'm an 8-10 normally.  I bought a large.  The tag says it's a large.  It fits like a size 2. I can't even get it on.<br /><br />Quality is just ok, but for the price is acceptable.  I was purchasing to take on vacation with me to the Dominican Republic.  It isn't going to work due to sizing issues.  This one is going back. I would not recommend ordering until they get their sizing chart corrected to reflect the true size. Sizing charts often very but this is extreme."
2.0,The outfit need to be a little bit longer in length for girls with longer torsos and bigger glutes. This world has enough going on without our babies half naked too. Other than that the quality was durable.
2.0,"Ordered 11M, way too small (short). Returned those & tried 12M, still far too narrow. Tired of this game, especially since my previous pair of exact same brand & size were a perfect fit. This vendor charges more for each 1 size increase. I'm counting this very disappointing purchase as $17.50/ year for 2 years, then get better product & customer care @ zappos."
2.0,The image is a heavy weird plastic like vinyl.
2.0,finally found them in the package  not emerald green at all
2.0,Beautiful dress but sizing is no where near accurate.
2.0,They were a little tighter than the same ones I tried on in the store. Initially wearing them was quite painful on the tops of my feet.
2.0,"The credit card slots are falling apart because they are cheaply stitched. Ive had this wallet for less then a month, and although I like the design, the part that holds my money and accessories should last longer then a month."
2.0,"I was sooooo excited when I opened this package. The dress was well made and fabric was a decent weight and seemed almost perfect. I‚Äôm pretty sure it would have been beautiful- if I could have put it on..<br /><br />I undid the buttons up front....and tried to fit it over my head (a lovely, normal-sized head)....but couldn‚Äôt get it on. Ended up putting my head through the sleeve hole on accident. That‚Äôs because THE NECK SCARF WAS SEWN TOGETHER SHUT!!!!!  WTAF???? It seriously was an opening of about 4.5‚Äù for the head/neck....<br />And another weirdness, there is a random zipper in the back of the dress, not hidden and I couldn‚Äôt find an actual uprise for it. The belt seemed a little small, but I didn‚Äôt try it on because I was so disappointed. I purchased an XL (5‚Äô 8.5‚Äù y‚Äôall and 155lbs)<br /><br />I gave one star becausee, the dress was definitely one of the better made ones I‚Äôve encountered here, even with its issues)."
2.0,"The Watch Box was damaged at the bottom, Watch was tightly cramped in the Box. Watch LCD was not switching on even after holding the &#34;A&#34; key for 5 min. Had to go for a refund. Overall Delivery was on time but the product lack the quality."
2.0,"I purchased the top in black and white.  The first photos for these colors show a split at both sides of the bottom of the shirt - this is not what I received.  I find the fabric to be quite stiff, not soft like other reviewers.  I'll be returning these."
2.0,The earlobe clasp is broken for one of the earrings
2.0,"i didn't like the bulkiness of the  jacket, i imagine it was warm but  simply  was to big and  heavy for recreational use"
2.0,Nice fit but advertising it as genuine leather is a bit misleading. It‚Äôs leather but a microscopically thin leather glued to a thick plastic so technically it‚Äôs leather but not what you think. Knowing that the price should be less
2.0,"I loved this belt, it allows you to adjust to your precise waist size.  Then he pins that held the buckle fell out it cost me $20 to have my cobbler rivet new pins. Now it works fine but it was like paying for it twice."
2.0,The shirt fits a little funny on my husband. My husband likes ordering XL so that sleeves are longer then larges. Well that being said the sleeve are VERY long on this shirt and he doesn't like the low neckline on this shirt as well.
2.0,"It is not very nice it looks cheap and tacky. And it is not amber, it is very strong orange, not like the picture"
2.0,The open shoulder top too looked a little off with the open shoulders not fitting on my arms well. I had to return it.
2.0,Beautiful but all the charms fell off after 1 week
2.0,Material is to cheap
2.0,Fabric not for me  Big enough
2.0,I second the other review. I gave it the benefit of the doubt thinking the other reviewer misjudged leightweight with cheap but this is clearly overpriced. It leaves a cheap impression from the molded plactic clips to the interior of the bag. Way overpriced for what it is.
2.0,"I loved this dress!  But it doesn‚Äôt fit well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 7‚Äù about 165lbs with a 36D/DD chest. It was tight getting it on over my shoulders but could manage.  But once on, I couldn‚Äôt move my arms cause it was tight throughout the shoulders.  And there is NO stretch in the fabric. If I‚Äôd gone up a size to fit better on top, it would be gigantic below the waist. The length was a little long for my liking, it hit right at the bottom edge of my calf."
2.0,"They are very synthetic, uncomfortable because the size range is enormous, so how can you wear a size 6 and a pair of socks cover from 6 to 9, just ridiculous.<br />I bought 3 pairs of Bombas socks that were really cotton and good quality but not these ones. I did regret. The size was real and very comfortable, but I was not able to order again the same ones and then I bought these above that I really hated."
2.0,I ordered a XL but what I got seemed like a M. I‚Äôd suggest to size up a size or two if you can.
2.0,The straps are held on by plastic rings which broke before I ever got to wear it. Besides that this was way to big and I have big boobs...
2.0,"They arent thick wool socks as expected, only the top is thick. They are comfortable, but not super warm. Colors are great, just not fully what i wanted."
2.0,Cheap quality and not what I expected :(
2.0,"It arrived slightly later than expected. It looked good, but it didn't actually work. I sent it back without any problems."
2.0,"This appears to be homemade like a kid working on a project for school, that came out fairly ok.  I haven't worn it.  Pictures make things look more appealing I would say."
2.0,"They‚Äôre wonderful, for the three days you can wear them. But you can‚Äôt store them anywhere, and they really don‚Äôt rebound after washing them with gentle soap and water. Too bad: other than only lasting three wearings, they‚Äôre great!"
2.0,Long crotch had to return
2.0,"This skirt fit as expected.  The color was also as described.  The picture showed a very slim fit.  But the fabric was fuller than I had hoped for.  Also, the fabric is very sheer. It is totally see through.  Even with a very thick slip underneath, it just didn't look quite right.  I bought this for my daughter's wedding and they just didn't work out.  I ended up returning this item."
2.0,"These were the gift tags give as a result of ordering the Initial luggage tags.  Since they did not match the others, we could not use them.  We just placed them in our storage area."
2.0,This was a nice dress in theory but it wasn't thick enough and was quite small.
2.0,"Too large for everyday use,very large"
2.0,The pic is a bit misleading. The product is bigger and loose as opposed to the one shown in the picture.
2.0,"My 6 year old son got this as a gift for Christmas and immediately wanted to make the ""food"".  All the recipes for the gummies are basically the same, you just change the flavor to suit your taste.  We never did find a flavor or combination flavor that he liked, and ended up throwing out all of the treats he made.  The drinks were equally as bad tasting.  There were no directions as to how to set up your ""lab"", just a lot of connector pieces that didn't seem to fit everywhere you wanted them to.  As other reviewers stated, you need to have an adult there to help with the mixing.  He grew bored with the kit, put it away, and has not asked to play with it again."
2.0,I must have a small head because these are too loose for me to wear.
2.0,"Pretty top, but when I washed this top it shrunk so much I could not ware it again. SAD"
2.0,I ordered a size large and the bottoms were more like a size small. Very disappointed in this because I really like this style and wanted very much for it to fit. Unfortunately I had to return it.
2.0,The accuracy and speed Ennis of this product is not the problem it is Stellar however after wearing the shoes for just a couple of days they started coming a loose from the sole this is not good assemblyof a shoe.
2.0,"Sizing is super off. I ordered an XL, got a XXL. The top is huge, yet the arm holes are very small. Bottoms were tiny for being XXL. Closer to a L."
2.0,"your maybe thinking hey this might be cool, it is not. you'll look weird with this on."
2.0,Not happy with the quality. Wore them to Pilates class one time and the skids are rubbing off of the heel.
2.0,I am returning these. Just not my style
2.0,"Even the small is huge! Hung way past my booty and looked like a garbage bag. In order to fix it...I tied a knot on one side, which seemed to make it look decent and not as baggy. Ideal to wear while running errands or just around the house. Just way to big."
2.0,The prongs are huge and the cz is very loose. Prongs aren‚Äôt evenly spaced and a couple are sticking up. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
2.0,"I ordered these to go with a top.  They are anything BUT purple.  They are mostly clear with a vague pink color.  They are pretty, but definitely not purple.  The stones going down the shanks are very small.  They are a good size for me.  Disappointed."
2.0,I really liked this dress but as I put it on I realizes there is a hole in the pocket!!! :(<br />Very disappointed in quality.
2.0,Too small and I didn‚Äôt like the fabric.
2.0,Metal part of Macro Ring where battery connects broke after installing batteries. Very poorly made!! Had to put tin foil in bottom in order to make batteries work. Flash ring itself is great but poor construction.
2.0,Diamonds fall out within a week or so
2.0,Very hard to lock in place and easily unhooked. I‚Äôve lost 3 already
2.0,I can‚Äôt use this product because it came with no adhesive on the back
2.0,"Cheap, but great for Halloween"
2.0,"Extremely disappointed in the color. Which was the main reason that I purchased it because it was a beautiful color in eggplant however I opened it up today and it's purple..like, Raven's purple. A completely different shade in picture. If I had known that this was the actual color I would not have purchased it, but keeping it anyway because sending it back would just be a pain. Disappointed."
2.0,It's nice. Ordered xl for my daughter who normally wears large. This I think runs really small. I'd order 2 sizes up just to be safe.
2.0,"I got this document holder in blue, very pretty color.  The zippers are all functioning. Those are the pros. Now for the cons. There were missed stitches on 1‚Äùsection of outside zipper - remedied that with hand stitched repair.  There were frayed ends on all the bindings inside - clipped off & sealed with Fray Check. Pockets inside were a tad small for passports- seam ripped on one side inserting passport. Added more Fray Check to stop tearing.  Ugh!  Should have returned this but no time to do so before trip. Consider yourself warned!"
2.0,Hat looks like the picture. The shipping was HORRIBLE! The hat is useless because it was completely crushed during shipping. Not pleased. The hat itself looks great.
2.0,Wish I would have read all the reviews before buying. These buttons are tiny.
2.0,The clasp is small so it‚Äôs hard just to get some mask straps in it. The gold is tarnishing already after using a week.
2.0,Like style just not fitting :„Ää
2.0,No adjustable strap.
2.0,The quality of the workmanship and the flimsiness of the material. The one pocket was not made correctly and there were blue marks on the trim inside the dress that look like is from a marker..  No  fabric content label on the dress and no information about care.
2.0,"I previously ordered Finger Lights from a different company and those were surprisingly great.  I thought that they would all be the same but the ones distributed by this company were slightly different:  1) some of the lights were on and already dimmed when received, 2) the red colored lights contained 2 batteries versus 3 so they don't last as long, 3) slightly more plastic flashing on the toys so they can be sharp.  This might be a bit critical for LED's that end up at about 17-cents each but for the same price get them from a different distributer."
2.0,"As others note, the style of this top is nothing like the picture, not off shoulder, not loose. It‚Äôs fitted around the hips."
2.0,Don‚Äôt fit well- too loose.
2.0,With minimal usage also the top portion of the show tore off at the seams. Wont recommend it
2.0,Way too short!!
2.0,"My wife got me this as a gift, but unfortunately I'm unable to wear it because it is much too small. Be sure to order at least a size or two up from what you normally wear."
2.0,I purchased it in hope it has the same quality of one of my favorite LuLuLemon sports bras (They look almost identical). Sadly I was wrong; it was hard to get on and didn't fit well. I returned it.
2.0,I ordered this shirt in white and it came with a pink tint like it was washed with something red. I also didn't find it to flattering it clung to me in all the wrong places
2.0,These say that they are a 20gauge but they are more like 14 couldn't put it in my cartilage or in my nose since they are way to big!
2.0,The gold rims are very cheap looking. It's a weird color gold! The blue lens are pretty. Not a fan of the metal color tho!
2.0,"The ball on the end of an earing usually twists off but with more than half of these, the front of the earing comes off instead."
2.0,"color is red not brown, it doesnt match the photograph."
2.0,"Hopefully I'll like it just fine IF I can get both the mold AND the chemical smells out. It came in sealed plastic (as expected) but no silicone gel pack. I just put some of my own in; I'll let it sit outside in the sun for another 24 hours. It came just as described, no other surprises, so if I get it clean of those toxins I'll keep it, otherwise it's going back and I'll probably go with one of the E-Bags."
2.0,Not true red has some white treads through the blouse weird color
2.0,It looked cheap the presentation was horrible. I paid $25 and change for this set and you send it to me in plastic really?!. Whatever happened to gift box so I can wrap it up and actually present it as a gift. I am so disappointed. It was supposed to be a Xmas gift now I have nothing to give at the party. The pendant and earrings are cute just smaller than expected. Not enough sparkle. It looks as if they're turn quickly.
2.0,"Mine came in early, in good condition, and hasnt turned since i recieved it, however i was looking for a much smaller circumference since this one hangs wayyyy too low and its very unflattering. I probably wont wear it much."
2.0,I guess I didn't read the whole description.  These are way too big but don't fee like sending them back.
2.0,They turned my fingers green within 4 hours of wearing them!
2.0,The skirt was awful. The material was substandard and flimsy and not at all how it was pictured in the ad. I just gave it away.
2.0,"Unfortunately, they just seemed bigger than I would have liked. I sent them back."
2.0,"Sent it back.  Looked cheap and the co. sent me a similar case, but not what I ordered."
2.0,"Weird fit, I have a short torso, so this style definitely didn't work for me! I'm 5'0&#34; 138lbs, and the top didn't even come close to covering my DDD's!!"
2.0,"This sweatshirt makes that fuzzball appearance due to its high polyester concentration. Because this color is white, even the smallest amount of dirt that gets stuck in these fuzzballs show. I would prefer the champion eco fleece sweatshirt"
2.0,I purchased the size tj said I should an the thing was so small it didn‚Äôt fit around my waist at all.
2.0,Did not fit to size chart given in product infirmation.
2.0,"Only issue was, I washed and hung dry and the sweater shrunk."
2.0,I was honestly hoping for better from these but sometimes you really get what you pay for. Not only are the colors not as bright as they look on here. Two different earrings broke just minutes after I opened them.
2.0,"I gave these 3 stars bc the lenses are VERY blue and distort across the lens..the magnification isn‚Äôt the same all the way around.<br />They are cute, and very light weight, but ultimately useless to me as they give me a headache to wear bc of the weird distortion of the lenses."
2.0,"I would recommend looking elsewhere for a backpack even if the price seems unbeatable. I was stitching the shoulder strap back in place on the third day. I use this backpack for my work meals, and a portable charger... thats it. My estimate, 6-7 pounds at most. I've had to sew the zipper back onto the backpack because for whatever reason I saw there was a 2 inch area that either was never stitched on properly, or the thread deteriorated. 2 days later, another inch adjacent to where I just hit with the needle. Not trying to dog whoever is selling these, but whoever is making them needs a refresher course on keeping fabrics together.<br /><br />gave 2 stars because with the deal, I only have to make it last a month and I'll have gotten its worth out of it. Or maybe I'm just fabricating my own silver lining."
2.0,"great feel but,compresion on top not strong enough,keep sliding down."
2.0,"I have to agree with other reviewers: everything about this cardigan is ‚Äúoff‚Äù from the pictures.  The colors aren‚Äôt nearly as vibrant - the dark grey is more medium gray and the blue is meh.  The sleeves (which look long) are loose and too short.  The general style is boxy and yet when you snap the buttons you won‚Äôt be able to breathe.  It just fits really really odd.  When returning, I couldn‚Äôt decided between saying it‚Äôs too small (sleeves, waist) or too large (overall scale and boxiness).  I have a slim figure, usually wear a 2-4 so purchased a small.  It‚Äôs just not flattering and looks old lady."
2.0,So the product details doesnt say what the hook is made out of.. I received it and the hook looks likes cheap plastic. The necklace is not the one in the picture. It actually appears to be cheaper than the one in the picture.<br /><br />All i have to say is that I hope my girlfriends 10 year old son will appreciate it as a gift...
2.0,"Was a great watch and easy to read‚Äì that is until the pin came up unexpectedly and the watch hit the pavement and broke into multiple pieces.  I replaced it with a Casio G-Shock, but those are difficult to read in low light, so I am ordering another Timex Indiglow. Hopefully this next one won't come apart, because the Indilo watches are the easiest for my old eyes to read in dim light."
2.0,Maybe a darker color would be better but unfortunately the lighter colors (I‚Äôm guessing) are all going to be a bit see through.
2.0,Bands don‚Äôt clip in right.
2.0,"This looked awesome online, However the material is so strange and wrinkles badly.  I haven't worn it yet."
2.0,The item ok but they pack it in a cheap bag.  It not look new and nice. Thought to buy like a gift but couldnt.
2.0,This dress was awful.  No belt included.  The front hem was 3‚Äù longer than the back.  Poorly made.
2.0,"too much polarization effect, get headaches all the time, would not recommend it"
2.0,Does not pass the test for &#34;any Table Thickness&#34; . . some tables are very very thick . . . . . and I tried it just over the weekend - this gadget did not help.
2.0,"Strange, foamy material. Definitely not fleece. Sized a bit small."
2.0,"This piece looks great but there is no way to attach it. It will fall off, and if you place it behind your ear, you won't see the spikes. And it will still fall off. So either way, the idea is great but the item does not actually work."
2.0,It looked so good and broke so easily. There is one thin elastic band holding the top up and it snapped while trying it on and trust me I wasn‚Äôt asking it to stretch beyond its means.
2.0,There are lines (not scratches) across the lenses that make it really difficult to focus. They work for simple use but not good for sport activities or driving.
2.0,These masks are fine unless you want to use to tie-dye. These don't have a high enough cotton content so the dyes rinsed right out.
2.0,"Was really looking forward to changing my current industrial bar and  it is near impossible to put it through the first hole because of it‚Äôs curvy design... and also doesn‚Äôt help that there‚Äôs only ONE unscrewing end of the design contributing to the difficulty of putting this on.<br /><br />Once I can figure out how to put the snake industrial bar, I‚Äôll leave my rating as is..."
2.0,They roll down. These undies do not stay up and therefore has no tummy control. They fit perfectly though and they quality is good.
2.0,"Does not contain the breasts. I‚Äôm a c/d cup and my daughter is an a/b cup and it did not work for either of us. We were both falling out of it. It‚Äôs a beautiful design, but would only work if you kept completely still and did not move your arms or twist your torso at all. Fabric and construction are high quality as expected from Becca."
2.0,The hat fits perfect but the design is really small.
2.0,"I love this, but they are REALLY wide. They fit perfect, but they are so wide in my ear lobe that there is a huge gap between my lobe and the gold gage in the front and back. I love them a lot that I where them every day, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to find ones that aren‚Äôt 1/2‚Äù wide, because no one has ear lobes that wide. I‚Äôm a man with big hands and fingers, and you can see how crazy wide these things are"
2.0,The bracket is cute it‚Äôs just the clasp is very loose
2.0,"Great fabric, great colors, but WAY too large. Order at least a size smaller than normal. I decided to keep this shirt because it is cozy, but can only wear it to bed as it‚Äôs way too big for me."
2.0,"Fit, but not long enough."
2.0,It says fairy wings but it looks more like butterfly wings. I bought it for my 6 yr old but the fit was snug. Probably better for a 4 yr old. A lot of glitter that falls everywhere.
2.0,No es c√≥modo.
2.0,I bought the wine colored ones and they are see through :( they fit super comfy and I love the color I'm just super disappointed you can see through them
2.0,"One pocket was ragged, not sewn.  Sizing ran very small."
2.0,"Again, the size chart is way off on this blouse, and there's no way that I will be able to wear it.  I carefully read reviews and looked at the size chart.  This does not fit like most XL clothing items I've purchased.  It's also very sheer, and I would recommend wearing something like a camisole under it!  I feel like I've thrown away money on this purchase."
2.0,Didn't like it because I got a wrong color as compared to what I ordered or saw on the picture
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in this swimsuit. Bought for my 3 year old. Tried it on her and the shirt is just not a good length. Its just too short. Its also not very good quality. The collar doesn't lay flat, no matter what. Then after washing it, the black bow on the front came off. Its only glued on. The hems started to fray as well. Just not something I'd purchase again honestly. But I guess you get what you pay for"
2.0,It wasn't what I expected. They look like out of space glasses. Not stylish at all
2.0,"My daughter wanted these for a Christmas gift for her and her BFF, my daughters broke on the second day."
2.0,Should have wrist size.
2.0,My fault for not reading the specs. Belt is waaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy smaller than expected. I'm not referring to fit. Fits because it's stretchy. The width is just........ Was just........ Surprising.
2.0,Why are the sleeves so large. I ordered a medium according to my waist size which is 27 but the sleeves are ginormous. Returning might try a small but I‚Äôm not sure.
2.0,Cute suit but too small.
2.0,They look nice but cheap made one pair broke within a couple hours of wearing.
2.0,Not what I pictured at all!!! Not worth it.
2.0,It was pretty small. I got it and it arrieved sooner then it was listed which was awesome. Just way tight it could barely fit over the top of my arm
2.0,The sweatshirt  is very lightweight and not what I expected. Sent back.
2.0,It ripped in the wash while on delicate cycle. :/
2.0,"This is about what I expected, except that the front closure isn't great. It's hard to open. I was hoping for more like a clip style and it's one of these things where you have to slip the hook into a fabric slot - not easy to do because the fabric catches on the hook. Aside from that it's fine. I am a D cup and I have a lot of side boob going on with this, but I just bought it to wear around the house so whatever. Does not provide any support to speak of, but again, not what I was really looking for."
2.0,looks very different. from picture. Kinda cheap looking.
2.0,This earring broke on the 2nd time I wore it.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Very disappointed.
2.0,too large but too small bands around waist. pretty uncomfortable.
2.0,The lenses are too narrow. I am returning.
2.0,Update: Having to remove some stars. Sadly the blue is coming off in dots. These fit great and looked so nice when i got them but I can‚Äôt wear them out where people will be looking at me. I really hate it because I loved them so much.<br /><br />These are very nice. For this price I can buy several to have in different cars and Rvs.
2.0,Couldn't get it over my hips and I have no contacts to complain about it!
2.0,"I ask for an S size, the top is ok because it has fittable straps, but the short is more like an M or an L, than an S. The fabric is a little chiper, but it's comfortable and nice for a pijama. But if you are looking for an S, this is not the pijama set you should chose, and if you are looking for an M or L size, better chose one smaller."
2.0,I expected a better quality skirt. It's light weight & flowy as long as you don;t have a big butt or wide hips or extra weight around your mid-section.
2.0,Was cut to small!
2.0,"These earrings are super cute, I want to keep them and wear them, but sadly they are too heavy."
2.0,"im only giving a two because the elastic was way to thight, well made good quality but tight on the waist"
2.0,It is a beautiful piece but so tiny it looks like a child's bracelet.  My 9 year old put it on and it fit great.  Disappointed b/c I love Mf.
2.0,Meh. I order size L in 3 colors and sizes were not consistent<br />This color was too big the other colors fit perfect<br />Unreliable sizing
2.0,Already have two of these tops! The last one I ordered did have makeup it seems on it or something all over it?
2.0,"I was REALLY disappointed at how tacky gaudy of these glasses were, none looked like what was pictured, and all but two pairs were embellished with tacky rhinestones. I'm only keeping one pair and sending the rest to my little nieces for dress up as I can't see a grown woman with any fashion sense donning these glasses. They basically reek of cheap. You can buy the same at a flea market for about $2 each."
2.0,I bought these ear cuffs as a Halloween gift for my teen aged niece but will not give them to her as I think they could cause injury. The clasp that attaches to the ear is made of very thin sharp metal and was almost sharp enough to cut my finger. I own quite a few ear cuffs myself and have never encountered any with such unsafe clasps.
2.0,"The dress is super cute and comfortable. That said, it was HUMONGOUS on me and one of the slits is so high that with one small breeze, the world sees your undies or more (which really isn't my goal)."
2.0,The waist of this shirt is too small. You must have a very small waist to wear this shirt. I am going to have to tailor it so I can wear.
2.0,"Provides a lot of extra space and organization; BUT it is not sturdy. If the purse has more space available, it will be necessary to lift up and readjust the unit every time the purse is opened."
2.0,"Sizes run about a size smaller. Didn't fit, had to return it. But the return process was simple."
2.0,Poor quality and not a nice design like the image shown
2.0,The material is very cheap.. did not like it at all..
2.0,Would have been a 5 star but I order two set of these so I should have received 8. I only received 1 set and something like a toiletry bag. I was disappointed if they only had one set they should have contact me. The 1 set is nice and durable and able to fit two pair of shoes in one bag.
2.0,This item looks nothing like the picture I would not recommend this item to anyone plus the material isn't the best it's very cheap I'm not satisfied.
2.0,"zipper faulty and tie too short, would have really liked if it fit"
2.0,"Really isn't what it looks like. Runs extremely small as well. Looks way longer than it actually is. Looks more like a maternity shirt, and makes me look pregnant, and I'm not a large person. Material also isn't the best."
2.0,"Returned cause it says ""Forever in my heat"" and not heart."
2.0,"Necklace that arrived is somwhat similar to this, but extremely heavy and feels like its strangling me."
2.0,Love the pants!! so cute!! and they fit well. but the first time i tried them on the front button broke off immediately üò≠
2.0,Definitely made for small children (like 6yo & under)
2.0,Just simple
2.0,"I tell my wife I'm trying no problem,"
2.0,The material on the dress wasn't great and there was just no shape. It's also too low cut to wear with a bra which doesn't work with such a a thin fabric. Returned.
2.0,The picture for this item - Print 101 - shows that it is a tan/olive like color. It's a very strong brown that really overpowers the design. Nowhere near as nice looking.
2.0,"This is a simple nice casual dress but it seems to be only proportionate in the material for only xsmall petite non figured physique.  If you have curves, it raises the dress up above your curves showing private areas."
2.0,"like New Yo'kuhs would say:  fergedbout et....it's China, what's there to say."
2.0,The sleeve open shoulders were too large to the point that it made it look frumpy. Fabric was very thin. Seemed like it would only stand up to only one wear and fabric could start to fray or pill.
2.0,Was too small and the material was much thiner (not really good for cold weather) than I expected although it was lightweight as advertised.
2.0,I understand now why they are so cheap. The leather rips and peels and the silver turns brown in less than a week.
2.0,"I really loved the jacket, although it came smaller than expected... I'm a Medium size for all sweaters, hoodies & jackets but this one fit like a Small."
2.0,"Band gave up after 5 months continuous use. Would come unclipped constantly, and finish wore off."
2.0,Arms were SO tight and the waste was super baggy. Not a good fit for those with moderate bust but overall the dimensions seemed very weird. Not a good fit overall.
2.0,I guess I'm bringing this to Goodwill now.
2.0,"The hat look fine and has the weathered broke in feel.  However, Im a normal man size.  I am on the very last hole.  I prefer hats that im more centered up in adjustment.  When using the last hole it sit noticeably high above the ear and feels weird.  Dont buy this hat unless your sub 22"" around your head."
2.0,Liked the fabric and color fine. Nice quality for the price. Fit too snug across the shoulders and chest. Unusual fit for my standard 2X husband.
2.0,"The XL was like a medium. If the sizing was right, these would be amazing."
2.0,"I was unable to zip the coat.  I tried and tried, it just wouldn't budge from the bottom.  Otherwise,  coat is light weight and puffy and fit well."
2.0,"These shoes are very cute but they are not durable for little girls at all. The bows are attached with a tiny silver button and when my daughter tugged on the bows and they popped off. Once the bows are off there is no way to get them back on so now we just have the black shoes without bows. Also, the velcro on the shoes are not very strong my daughter wore these shoes about four times and the velcro does not stick anymore."
2.0,Diamonds are very small!!
2.0,"This item runs very small - like two sizes.  My slim 10 year old was barely able to fit the size 10.  She can normally wear a 7-8 no problem and this 10 was too tight for her to wear comfortably.  I ordered a size 14 which fits her a little bit big but looks comfortable for overalls.  PS, these are also very short shorts and have weird light patches on the butt, which are very obvious.  Overall, I would have probably returned if it weren't a gift from someone else."
2.0,"Review by Raina -Wrap too big and swirls around my wrist, numbers too small to read, but it's very pretty."
2.0,It was unflattering in me.
2.0,"My all-leather Fanning sandals gave out after 5 years so I thought I'd take a shot at this model. Ordered my usual size (10) and they were very tight and too short. Exchanged for size 11 - good length but still way too tight and painful when walking, especially at the arch support. I switched back to a Fanning size 10 (wishing they still made all-leather), and all good again. These sandals are for very tiny feet."
2.0,"arrived broken, looks cheap in person."
2.0,"I didn't care for this hat at all, it was too tight and the brim was completely in my view, I returned it"
2.0,Weirdly cut in the the shoulders and bust. The side seaming was weird and ended up making the dress almost inverted about halfway down. Returning. Fabric is nice though.
2.0,On line support referred to online manual and after testing all alarms was told to send in for repair.  Returned item instead
2.0,Kind of hurt my face to wear them
2.0,Cute but size up. Runs small
2.0,"Yes, I was disappointed. They looked cute at first, but then turned a rose orange color and turned my fingers green. I wouldn't recommend these rings if they were free even. Yukk!"
2.0,Nice bag but I tooo away points because it is HUGE for a crossbody. I am 5‚Äô5 and It looked like an oversized weekend bag on me. Returned it.
2.0,The key chain did not come with a key ring and is not a solid circle as pictured but a circle within another circle which makes it seem less sturdy like it will break easily. I plan to return this item.
2.0,Look bigger in website
2.0,Color fades.
2.0,"I liked the design of the product; however when it was delivered the ears of the ""wolf"" were so skewed it looked like the ears where coming out of one side of the head instead of the top of the head. Without the ears being so skewed, my wife would have loved the pendant. As it is, the pendant is sitting on a shelf along with other stuff we have not yet thrown out. Contacted the company vie email, but got no response."
2.0,"Delivered on July 1, 2019. The stone already fell out of the larger gauge stud."
2.0,Was freyed but otherwise would have been great but easily returned
2.0,"Too wide, too short, and the color is off.  I ordered pink, but it's more tangerine/orange.  Disappointing."
2.0,This is not what I expected; really lightweight
2.0,"The ring itself is cute and not long which is exactly what I was looking for. It‚Äôs also great for sensitive skin, not bothersome at all there. Unfortunately after wearing it for a week, the top ball has come off by itself and gotten lost. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise. If the company is willing to replace the ring, I will update my review."
2.0,"I don‚Äôt like the material, and it fits a bit small."
2.0,"Loved the dress but the zipper had major problems, I purchased it twice and had the same issue both times. I even took the dress to the tailor and she said the fabric was sewn over the zipper incorrectly. The tailor fixed the zipper but when I went to wear it for the event the zipper was still not easily zipping, it got stuck on the fabric and I had to rip the dress to get it undone. Great dress but not worth it if you end up breaking the dress when you have to wear it."
2.0,"I have been unlucky in purchasing any bathing suits off of Amazon.  I am 5' 7&#34;, 130lbs with long legs.  The bottom is too large but the top fit.  Oh well!"
2.0,"cute design, but letter peeled up immediately on first wash"
2.0,it's not good fail a lot
2.0,"The swimsuit was beautiful, but it covered nothing on my body. I measured myself according to their chart and ordered accordingly and it was still WAY TOO SMALL, very revealing. :("
2.0,It was super cute and comfy until it broke. I wore it for about two weeks before one of the strands broke off.
2.0,I bought these because the description said they can be curled. They can not. They are really shiny I guess to be expected for synthetic hair. I‚Äôm slightly disappointed. Like another reviewer said you get what you pay for. I will be sending them back.
2.0,Shirt is really long.
2.0,"It was way too smaller than I imagined even I knew the size was Asian base. Also, there was some stain when I received it. Too bad...."
2.0,"Junk, they wear out an get holes in them in 6 months"
2.0,"I ordered a three X but it fits more like a XL. This listing specifically said it was U.S. sizes, however, I do not agree. This is a beautiful suit and I really want to wear it but I also want to be comfortable in it. But one of my friends said she would take it, so at least she will look cute. :/"
2.0,Way too hard to get the jewel piece screwed in
2.0,"So these are cute.  *Really* cute.  However, it took all of a week before the post one one of them bent.  I was really disappointed."
2.0,The material is see through and has a strange feel.
2.0,The size runs small and the material is cheap.
2.0,Neck too small
2.0,"Quality is lacking, but price was low so that's to be expected."
2.0,Top is weird the pads throw off the fit. The bottoms were huge. It also was delivered late it was not in 2days as promised.
2.0,Runs small try one size up
2.0,Just a little thin and snug
2.0,There has to be nickel in it. I had a bad allergic reaction
2.0,"I really like these earrings, but the backs on a couple of the pairs don't appear as if they will properly secure the earrings. In addition, the colors I received did not match what I ordered. I chose these based on the photo because it they would have specifically fit how I determine what belongs to each of my twins. I'm a little disappointed by this but decided to keep them because one of my 1yo girls lost her earrings and really needed them. I will likely choose something different moving forward."
2.0,"The price and shipment was great. The item itself was not ""true to size"" they run small."
2.0,The necklace is cute and the perfect size but was badly tangled when opened. The packaging could sure use some work.
2.0,"The two stars are based on the faulty product information. I purchased several of these bags to fit a specific space in a car roof carrier.  As soon as I saw them, I knew they were NOT 18 inches.  Measured from end to end they were only 15 inches. That is a substantial discrepancy. I can't comment on the quality of the bags because I'm returning them."
2.0,"I purchased this 3 piece set Dress to wear on my trip to OKTOBERFEST in Germany. The Crop Top Blouse that came with dress was dingy yellow and very stiff  I washed it prior wearing,  color improved but the fabric ( 100 % cotton ) shredded like tissue on a delicate cycle / see photos. SO had to wear another blouse. The apron sent was not the one pictured on Amazon listing, the apron I received was stripped IVORY lace with WHITE trim.  the apron was so very poorly made, it was 18 1/2 inches long on one side and 21 inches on the other side. The blue dress itself was nice sturdy fabric and the  Embroidery was well done. The fit was very odd. This ""german"" dress was made in PAKISTAN.  $$$ This was way too much money for product I received.  This was not meant to be a Halloween costume I"
2.0,Metal came off of the wood
2.0,"I like the floral pattern but what i did not was that I ordered a small and it fits like a medium or large, and it has a very wide neck"
2.0,I don't fit the dress...
2.0,meh!  there are better choices at same price point
2.0,"Two suits the same, different colors. Both were ordered L, one fit like a small, other fit like medium.  Neither were American athletic swimming sports sizes. Very thin fabric, understandable product for low price. Sending back, not replacing. Don't want to play that game."
2.0,"Unfortunately, these do not work well to keep your hair dry while in the shower."
2.0,"The most recent purchase, they changed the fabric. from my first 2 orders, and much larger, because I washed them, I was wishing they would shrink, no luck! so I will have to donate them..."
2.0,Very cute. Dainty and pretty. Not an everyday wear but good for night outs or for dress up. Kinda pricey for the quality. I could if bought this at a dollar store. But oh well.
2.0,"The top was way too small, and the bottoms were okay but not what I was expecting"
2.0,Material too thin for my
2.0,"I liked the style, however, it was very light weight and I didn't think it would hold its shape after being washed. The sizes appear to run small."
2.0,"I love that this purse has a ton of pockets, but unfortunately the pockets on both sides of the purse are identical.  I had to mark one side of the purse to know which way it's facing and which pocket I need to open.  One of the pockets started to rip inside after about 6 weeks of use."
2.0,Hard to put on but realistic
2.0,Did not like how heavy the material was so I returned
2.0,The tank tops were a little to thin. Not impressed.
2.0,"This is a really neat novelty item. It looks great on. My only problem is that they advertise that it's a working lighter.<br />As you can see from other reviews, it is not a working lighter. I collect lights and can repair most I come across. This one isn't even desiged for the lid to open far enough for the flame to clear. If I can get it working, it will only burn the lid."
2.0,"I was super excited to receive this bag set, but wasn't impressed when I got it. Part of it is because I thought that the big tote was bigger (which was fine, that was on me). Since it was something different and I have been needing a new bag, I planned on keeping it, until I took everything out and looked closer. The big tote bag and the small wristlet bag both had multiple string frays. The small wristlet had 3 different spots where this was happening. The big tote didn't seem to have anything wrong with it at first, but when I looked at the handles, the same fraying was happening. (See photos attached.) I was HIGHLY disappointed from that point and decided to send it all back. The reviews sounded promising, which is why I bought it, but the product was a complete letdown for me."
2.0,Unless you have a small head this mask is to small for most men.
2.0,Pretty flimsy. No way you can put a phone in there and still look put together. Maybe a few dollars and an id or credit card.
2.0,Snaps won't attach if they do their off-centered or crooked for Quality looks like it was built in a rush. Thank goodness it's a 9 year olds using it
2.0,Very narrow and uncomfortable.
2.0,If you are allergic to metals avoid these
2.0,"Beautiful earrings with filmsy posts...for the money you pay, you don't expect the post to bend 45 degrees when you are trying to put them through your ear. First chance I get, am going to take these to jewelers to FIX them..."
2.0,"I ordered a small size since I am 5ft tall/115, but it is way too big, too frumpy-looking, and I absolutely do not like the polyester lining under it. I'd be so hot in it! The style pictured is very cute and sexy and summery, the dress is not. I am returning it."
2.0,Not only small but short. This is a Chinese product sold on other scam sites do not wast your money. Cheap material nothing at all like the picture. I bought 2xl I an a size 10 US and it was SMALL my daughter is a size 8 US and it was SMALL. I don't kow why Amazon has decided to sell crap.
2.0,"Pink frames included in this package, but none of these are for average size female face. Huge, and slide off easily"
2.0,"I liked the price, but you get what you pay for.  I might return these as the lenses are not totally clear.  There is some issues with how they were made I suppose.  My former pairs of nooz were very clear and I loved them.  Always got compliments on them, too.  But, the silicone nose piece kept falling apart and after several attempts to glue them and the fact the company doesn‚Äôt offer a replacement piece, I decided I would try something else.  The idea is awesome for this style of truly pocket readers, but obviously there‚Äôs issues with manufacturing. I‚Äôll try some other brand next."
2.0,"Way too small, opal part was way smaller than it showed in pictures. Post didn't even make it through my lip."
2.0,"The gem is shiny and pretty, I like it; but the stem is discolored and damaged (not smooth at all, like it's pock-marked).  I am returning this for a refund.  Maybe I just got a lemon, but I would not recommend this.  The photo shows one I wear and like on the left.  The Cocorina is on the right."
2.0,the product is ok but the package was with oil spots. I wanted to make a present and was very dissapointed.
2.0,"I wouldn't call this a ""comfort fit"" band as listed--it isn't rounded like a comfort fit band, but has more square edges. As a result it doesn't look great with my other band, which IS a comfort fit shape. The CZs go all the way around the band rather than just being at the top, which makes it wider around the finger than you would really want. I didn't realize the ring would have such a scratchy surface due to the way the CZs are mounted. I find it very uncomfortable as a result. I wish it was a true comfort fit and had CZs only at the top rather than all the way around."
2.0,Not quality fabric.
2.0,"I'm a bit disappointed in the overall quality of Frogglez Goggles. My son has used them at least 3 times a week since we purchased them about a month ago. The blue fabric has detached from the neoprene and I noticed yesterday that there's now a tear in the neoprene. Once the tear expands completely, which could be as early as today, the Frogglez will be tossed. I wish these had lasted the summer as my son finds them to be very comfortable, which is why I rated it with 2 stars."
2.0,"Had a hole in it. I love the look. Very flattering, but so disappointed about the hole"
2.0,the magnet strength is very weak.
2.0,You get what you payed for
2.0,The outfit was just a tad bit too big and I got it in a small.  I usually wear a s/m. The pants are a little different then they are in the picture. I have to get mine taken in.
2.0,Not what I was expecting. Its a ribbed tank dress and it's too big. Ordered a medium should have got a small. The longer you wear it the more stretched out it gets and after a few hours you look frumpy and sloppy.
2.0,too big. I'm 5'3&#34; 120 lbs and ordered a medium and both top and bottom were too big.
2.0,"I purchased this item as a gift for my girlfriend. She is allergic to nickel and it makes finding jewelry difficult. It was advertised that all Qianse products were nickel free and anti-allergic. Within minutes of her putting this necklace on the area surrounding it began itching and turning red. The product itself is lovely. Good design, bright sparkle, and she loved it.....until the itching. I would appreciate a response from the maker regarding the nickel free claim."
2.0,"Cord was very sticky and felt like wax. Comes as a necklace. Charms were nice, but overall the bracelet was not worth the price."
2.0,"The sweatshirt is nice, but the sizing runs huge!<br />Returned."
2.0,Too big and hard to breathe through
2.0,"This stuff is ok, the only problem is that it's really sticky, soft and hard to work with."
2.0,This is so pretty but unfortunatley does not fit me well and stoppers dont fit properly . Was difficult to put on and take off
2.0,Bought this sunglasses strap for work on a boat.<br />The strap was really hard to get on my sunglasses as they had some rubber at the end of the arms.<br />It‚Äôs a bit too long and tends to be pushed forward by the collar of my work shirt collar such that my light weight Maui Jim‚Äôs are pushed askew and need constant readjustment.<br />Also the fabric and stitching along the sunglass arms is too thick and pushes on the back of my ears.
2.0,Nice dress but it was small
2.0,"It is super cute, but rusts if it gets wet."
2.0,"Arrived so quickly and looked so awesome! I was looking for non transparent leggings that would cover everything. Upon putting them on, they fit like a glove and looked opaque but once I did the &#34;bend over test&#34;, I was disappointed. Returning."
2.0,"Loved the design of this watch - similar to a Timex Expedition watch.  The price was good and it was listed as a kid's watch.  The shipping was very slow (several weeks), but I expected that with the price and not Prime.  Then when it finally arrived, the watch is HUGE - even bigger than a man's watch.  See photo of a comparison between an adult man's watch, this one, and an adult women's watch.  The instructions were useless, but we figured it out ok.  My son complains that the buttons are really easy to bump and mess up the settings.  And now here's the biggest disappointment - my son has worn this watch for a little over a month and the pin just broke.  A new watchband will cost more than the watch.  :/  We will be ordering another Casio Men's AW80V-5BV instead."
2.0,"Shapeless, not structured. Not like picture. Returned this item because it was too soft to hold any sort of shape and was not at all flattering."
2.0,"Really cute dress and I loved the picture of it but when I got it the fit was very odd.  Perhaps I am not busty enough for it to look right, I am only a 36B and it hung off me.  Had to return, disappointed."
2.0,"It was cute in the photos, but it was like orderiing from ""wish.com"" when you see the photo, but what you get is not entirely the same fit as shown.  If you're a medium, order a large, the upper body fits bodycon and the bubble part is loose, which is how that part is supposed to fit."
2.0,"I went from a 34DD to now a 34F during pregnancy and this bra fits okay for wearing around the home and getting a rest from underwires.  However, this bra is cheaply made. After the first time I washed it, the threads at the bottom started pulling out and even though I cut it where it was shredding, the threads continue to pull off so this is definitely not going to hold up for long term use."
2.0,The material is really cheap and the seams are all off and uneven. They design is nice and if you know how to hem you can make wearable.
2.0,"I picked it for my wife because I thought it would be like the picture. It's not really pink and the Rock is a tad bit to large. Wife still liked it, woman"
2.0,My daughter only wears them a few times a week and they already broke off of the base. Happened with the same brand different style for my other daughter. Only lasted about 6  months. I‚Äôd find another brand and pay the little extra so you‚Äôre not replacing them after such a short amount of time.
2.0,Too small for husband .... only small adults can wear tour small mask.<br />They are stylish an practical for today‚Äôs needs/usages.
2.0,"I loved the dress.  Unfortnately, it runs very small.  Additionally, the dress had an ""odd"" stitch to create a gathered effect.  I had to return it.  I purchased another on from Fashion Nova."
2.0,"This product could be better, it fits my head but when I put the mask over the buttons. It won‚Äôt stay in place, it keeps falling off the second button"
2.0,I cannot believe I didn't catch it before ever ordering it because it's right in the picture used by the vendor in the description photo.  Merry spelled incorrectly missing the 2nd R.  (Mery)...
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:30fed37a8793953643f51a0d6f86df6a]] My husband have several Invicta watches and have always been happy with their quality, durability and craftsmanship.  That's why I decide to try sunglasses but so sad this LOOK a d feel SO CHEAP¬†The quality is NOT good at all."
2.0,The sleeves are much shorter than what is pictured.
2.0,Much tighter than advertised
2.0,"I like that these are very large framed glasses since I have a large head.  They are not dark at all though.  Cool that they are polorized, but it really doesn't matter if they don't block any bright light at all."
2.0,"Bought this dress for a wedding and wasn‚Äôt sure how it would look. I have an hourglass figure so I need something that pulls in at the waist and isn‚Äôt tight on the hips. I really liked this dress so I ordered it and was a little disappointed. Overall, the dress fit in my normal size but I feel like it was cut slightly different than what is shown on the model. The ruffle started at the center of the dress and went down on both sides versus off to the side (as seen on model). I felt like it was slightly low cut but it could also be because I have larger breasts, it might be okay for someone who has smaller breasts. The tie around the waist isn‚Äôt attached anywhere, it is held on by two small string holes in either side and it‚Äôs silky so it doesn‚Äôt really stay in place. I‚Äôm on the shorter side so it was long on me but it would probably look fine on someone who is taller to get the high-low effect."
2.0,These earrings are tiny.  They look like they're made for children.  Returned them.
2.0,Second time ordering these pants loved them so much I ordered a pair fir my son But was disappointed the Quality was not half as good as the first picture that I ordered
2.0,"If you are a smaller person purchasing this mask simply to make it easier to breathe under normal circumstances it may be fine.  I'm not a giant (6' 180) but I found the mask a bit small. Further, I bought it to sing and yet anytime you open your mouth fairly wide the insert makes your mask fall below your nose."
2.0,"The belt smells bad, and runs very small. If you are a child with no sense of smell it might work for you. I don't know if there is a way to get rid of the smell. The style is cute, but unusable."
2.0,The snaps are very difficult to snap and unsnap. I bought them to use for a dress for my infant granddaughter. I cannot use them.
2.0,"I did not receive the longer, tunic length item that was pictured, which was what I thought I was ordering. I got a short, regular length T-shirt, and like others have said, the painted logo is separated and lifted up from the material at the seam of the blue and red fabrics. It‚Äôs poorly made."
2.0,"Pretty, but cheaply made and turn your nose green after about 2 days."
2.0,They are cute! And fit like a glove. But when i bent over to pick something up the zipper bust‚Ä¶.
2.0,I was hoping these earrings were going to be bigger when I purchased these. They were really small and pretty steep for $24. Sellers should show an actual size picture or at least provide measurements. It would save time on unnecessary returns and questions.
2.0,I wore this ONCE!!! And i loved it!! I washed it and it shrunk..... WHY!!!!!! It's so cute!!
2.0,This necklace is only stamped 925 on the clasp of the chain. The heart and the butterfly are NOT stamped and look extremely cheap.
2.0,Amazon has told me I can only review certain elements and not the other negatives I had so relating to this specifically. The rune is right. That is the only reason it has stars. The chain is of extremely poor quality and like many others here before me it broke day one.
2.0,The clasp fell off the second time I wore it. Totally cheap.
2.0,This item is not the same as the picture. It is short sleeved. I hate that as I have scars surgeries on my left arm and bought this as a light cover up. Now I have just another short sleeve duster. It also is a one size fits all nut is very larger.
2.0,Very disappointed. The shoulders were way too wide and the dress is way too short‚Ä¶for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and it was still too short.
2.0,The silver ribbon looks pretty bad. I don't wear this shirt outside of the house. Looks and feels cheap.
2.0,"I like the hat. No problem there. Disappointed with how long it took to arrive. 3 weeks is too long a period for a simple item to ship within the Continental U.S. in the future, you might want to consider making this an Amazon prime item."
2.0,"First: if you're planning to use this item with a Gear Sport and you have a small wrist, don't. The magnets in the band can interfere with the performance of the interactive ring around the display. I won't call this a knock against the band: it doesn't advertise as being made for the Gear Sport, and the issue is only present if the end of the band is in close proximity to the watch itself.<br /><br />That said, I will call out the build quality of this item. It isn't great. The easy-release lever broke off within a week or two of wearing it, despite my never trying to remove it once it was on the watch. In addition, not every link in the band seems to be magnetic. The point of this sort of band is to be more adjustable than the usual holes found in other bands. I have used similar bands on other smart watches and found them to work much better.<br /><br />It's a shame. I haven't seen this sort of band in a 20mm size from anywhere else. Whether or not it works for you is largely dependent on the size of your wrist and luck of the draw in terms of the adhesive used on the quick release lever."
2.0,I wanted to have some of the USA Gymnastics performances to motivate my 3 years old who is now taking gymnastics classes.<br />In the whole DVD there are maybe 3-5 minutes of the USA gymnastics. Not worth it for the price.
2.0,"Fit larger than I expected. I'm 5'2&quot;, 120 lbs and A/B cup. I ordered a M based off of reviews, but I'm kinda wishing I would have gone with my gut and gotten a Small. Its loose enough that I'm afraid the top would completely come up if I cannon balled into the pool.<br />Bottoms fit large and I won't be wearing. But I'll try and make the top work."
2.0,Runs small for plus size women's face.
2.0,"Loved the print,style and color of this dress. Was exactly what I expected with an exception of the fit at the bustline.  I purchased a large with the hope it would fit a 36D but it was a no go. XL would have been too large below the bustline. I purchased another dress with the same cut/style/size by Back from Bali and it fit great. There are inconsistencies in sizing."
2.0,"not an 8, to big, rolls around and stays under my finger. Don't want to suggest order under size."
2.0,Returned for refund.  Seemed to run small and is a poly type material.  Not what I thought.
2.0,Made very cheap never used
2.0,I found it boxy and poorly made. The neckline lace overpowered the body of the shirt.
2.0,"Really uncomfortable, unwearable round and stiff toe box. I returned."
2.0,They look cute but made my earlobes swell up at the piercing. I have sensitive ears and was hoping this would work but it doesn‚Äôt.
2.0,Cheap looking and smaller than chart states
2.0,ordered a XX size and it was more like a medium...
2.0,"My girlfriend absolutely loves this piece, one of the charms fell off after two days of wearing it I hope I can get a new one replaced  because she really does like it"
2.0,"I am 5,7  140 lbs , ordered M and it is to short ."
2.0,"This hat may be a &#34;slouchy&#34; for an infant. As for stylish, meh at best. However, for the price I can't complain too much. It's a plain run of the mill cap that unfortunately runs very small."
2.0,The sandals did not last more than a month. Bad quality.
2.0,"These are so cheap and flimsy, bent them by just putting them on the fist time. Can‚Äôt wear them again now‚Ä¶.."
2.0,"Doesn't fit/hug the dial well. Part of the band oozes out around edges and looks ugly. False advertising, returning!"
2.0,Not well structured for curvy gal<br />Lots of side boob showing<br />Straps are not adjustable
2.0,I ordered these shirts for my daughter and I to wear at the beach. I could not wear mine because it was too small. My daughter could not wear hers because it was too small also. They are really cute ahirts but run really small.
2.0,"Elastic twists up in it, shrunk 2 sizes when washed and a must to iron"
2.0,The frame is too silver. It looks darker and more matted in the picture but is much brighter in person. i would hab liked it if the frame was more gray than silver.
2.0,Super cute but sadly the links keep coming apart on both pieces.
2.0,"I returned this item as it was just not what I wanted. I am 5' 11&#34; and broad shouldered. This jacket is a good length but too wide in the shoulders and too long in the sleeves. The material is a very stiff synthetic, almost like neoprene. The sleeves are stiff and the cuffs are awkwardly gathered with elastic. The hood is huge and has a stiff sort of brim on the front edge. The pockets are all oddly placed. They are good sized but the zipper openings are too small to put anything useful through. The pocket on the forearm could fit a cell phone but the zipper is only about 3 inches wide and in the center of the pocket, like the slot in a tissue box. This is a weird coat overall."
2.0,Nothing special cheaply made
2.0,The bra fits fine but the material is very stiff. I wouldn't order these again.
2.0,Too small and low quality
2.0,The strings are too big and when you closet bag up its so hard to open it -.-
2.0,"I liked the color, feel, and quality of this band, but not how wearily it secured to my wrist. Multiple times, it fell of my wrist just by brushing it against my side. Most times I was able to catch my watch, but eventually it lead to my watch falling to the concrete and breaking the screen. I would NOT recommend."
2.0,I didn't like the nude fabric.
2.0,"I ordered REDESS Fleece Lined Leggings for Women, 3 Pairs Winter Warm Velvet Leggings.  I didn't have any choice to select size. Some reviews selected to size but not me!! I am 5'7&#34;  and 137 lbs.  Usually I wear M-L for leggings but this is XS/S.  Also quality is not good. Pay more and wear nicer."
2.0,"they look great and the posts screw tightly into the back, but the edges are really sharp. really uncomfortable when laying down on my side"
2.0,"The sizing is way off. I actually ordered a size larger than I normally wear, because I‚Äôve had some fit problems with this style of dress in the past that were fixed by ordering up a size. This time, I should have ordered up two sizes! The bust was way too tight, definitely not designed to fit anyone with more than an A cup. I‚Äôm sending back the medium and ordered both a large and x-large to see which will fit better, because the dress is seriously cute and the construction is good."
2.0,"Wanted to love this bra but unfortunately Pour Moi styles have waaaay too shallow of cups for me and never run small enough in the band. I didn't care for the color of the fabric underneath the stretch lace or the feel of the straps over my collarbone. If the band were tighter I may have felt less discomfort and kept it. A good fitting bralette style is all us larger busted, small backed ladies want!"
2.0,"Material is a polyester blend. It's thin material, and the pleats don't lay flat. They flair out and look more like a ruffle. The leather looks to be vinyl too doesn't look, feel or smell like leather. Spend your money on better quality. This one isn't it."
2.0,Did not stick well. Quite dissapointed
2.0,"I ordered my normal size, medium, and it was too big. I am 5‚Äô6 and 140 lbs if that helps anyone. Also, the red material was semi see through. Sending back for a refund."
2.0,Nice fabric. It stretches out though. This mask was riding up into my eyeballs all day. I wish I hadn't bought these. The ears are not adjustable so you can't fix it if it's too big.
2.0,The swimsuit is really cute. I ordered a small to fit the top but the bottom is really small.
2.0,Not great. It‚Äôs just s stocker over the plug.
2.0,They‚Äôre really big. Check the dimensions carefully!
2.0,"I feel less like a chef and more like I'm about to wax somebody in this jacket.  It is not as cheaply made as I thought it would be, but the collar comes up really far and bothers my neck. It does give room for hips and butt however it is snug around the top!"
2.0,"Didn't protect my phone at all... pretty, but clearly not a case - more of a decoration."
2.0,"The dress didn‚Äôt fit as expected. I went by the measurements and even read through every single review to make certain the dress would fit. The sleeves are way too tight-my 4 year old grandson would even be hard pressed to fit his arm through the sleeves of this dress. It was around three sizes too small‚Ä¶.. plus while the dress itself was a medium/ dark blue with white polka dots the collar of it was black‚Ä¶: I am not sure what that was so‚Ä¶. It looks very odd - like they had ran out of material when it came time to sew the collar on and then just haphazardly Willy nilly used left over material from something else. Not a good look at all. The material was pretty nice, the style of the dress is really cute and it was sewn really well, however. Such a shame that they didn‚Äôt size it according to their own fitting charts and attached a collar that did not match the dress. üòû"
2.0,"I am disappointed in what arrived. All the information you have to go on for quantity is the picture. Since it shows 2 i was lend to adsume there are 2 coming. No where does it say one quantity. Unless the amount of bands that come are hidden, one is only shipped"
2.0,My son was wearing this light winter down jackets ÔºåWhen he take off it has a lot down on he black T shirt ÔºéI try three day it keep happenÔºé
2.0,Even though this dress is really stunning but disappointed the fact that it did not fit me. I went with the size chart but did not fit me at all.
2.0,The watch was too manly for my taste
2.0,A couple minutes in the wallet already had scratches on it. Not completely convinced it‚Äôs genuine leather. Would not buy again.
2.0,Looks cheap would be more of a play dress
2.0,"these glasses are claimed to be polarized, but it is not true. in addition, very cheaply constructed. I know I paid only $12 for them but I can get these for half the price from the local swap meet. as i was cleaning the lens with minimal force, the right lens popped out."
2.0,"Super disappointed, I‚Äôve ordered three of this exact same dress but in different colors and each one fits differently. One fit ok and the other two were way too small and all were bought in a size large. Also the pink is completely see through!"
2.0,The quality is bad
2.0,"Very disappointing buy. Cheap fabric, very short and not at all like the length pictured, the buttons were crooked and there were loose threads on all the seams and buttons and button holes."
2.0,Not what it looks like. Expect a very thin zip up. Cute but deceptive.
2.0,"Heavy, clunky, and thick. Chain not as long as I thought. Doesn‚Äôt hang nicely"
2.0,"I loved these shoes in the beginning, but after 3 months the velcro on the straps was totally unusable. It just deteriorated! After that these fell off my kids feet. Not happy at all."
2.0,this top is down to my knees lol
2.0,These were so cute - until I got in the pool.  They trap air in such a way that you suddenly have a giant butt or stomach and no amount of adjustments get rid of the air.  Just no.  These were sent back
2.0,"I am probably one of the few reviewers who actually paid for these glasses. They are just barely OK.  They sit high on my nose and don't feel stable at all. The extra lenses are nice but the frame seems a bit flimsy to me so I don't know how long they will last.  If you are looking for glasses that will hold up to the wind on a bicycle or motorcycle, I would look elsewhere.  I got these on a lighting deal and can see why they might be having a tough time selling them."
2.0,Was fine until it snapped on the third day of wearing it
2.0,It's small and looks like the picture but the chemical smell is overwhelming.  I've washed it multiple times and it's still very strong.
2.0,Styling looks nothing like photo and there is puckering of the fabric around the seam binding in the front by the arm holes - very noticeable.  Fits like a snug tank while photo of product looks more tunic like & free flowing.  Also does not adequately cover the backside as shown in the product photo.  Really disappointed as I was going to pair this with leggings for a holiday photo with my aging mother.  Runs considerably smaller than marked and I ordered up a size.  A total wash out for my purposes.
2.0,"Too small. I thought it would fit cuz it said 52"" chest. I thought I was a 50 but I was wrong. Still way to small even if I was a o50"" chest. It is heartbreakingly beautiful"
2.0,"Well, you get what you pay for. The material is a shiny, stretchy best described as ""Halloween costume material."" The sleeves are incredibly shorter than depicted as well and not quite to the elbow, but midway point. I'd call the quarter sleeves and not quite 3/4 sleeved. And it runs incredibly small."
2.0,Way too small. The shirt could have worked but the pants were about two sizes too small.
2.0,Pockets not deep like cargo pants should be.
2.0,"I knew these would be a little bigger than my last pair of sunglasses, but these are huge!  As in, my husband and son can't stop laughing when I wear them... not really the effect I was going for.  Have you seen Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka movie?  You know when they go in the TV room?  That's what these glasses look like."
2.0,"The quality looks cute, but the pins don‚Äôt hold up."
2.0,Much smaller than a normal XL
2.0,"This skirt is made completely of polyester material, which means that the slightest movement creates static, and little electric shocks. This is a problem for a flamenco skirt, which is meant to be swished, grabbed, etc. I would not recommend this product."
2.0,Just looked and felt cheap
2.0,"This tank is not the size pictured.  I'm 5'8"" 145 lbs and typically wear a medium.  The tank is built short, like a square and rides up.  Even if I were to have gotten the large it still would have been too short."
2.0,nice but they broke the first day i had them
2.0,Fits most wrists-I think not.  I have a medium size wrist and it was very tight.
2.0,It was just like the picture but the sizing is way off
2.0,"They feel good, size is not for everyone, slides off my face."
2.0,I loved this but it unraveled after first wear and I had to send it back
2.0,This is a cute fall dress but way too short. The layers are strange in how they are cut and tights or pants must be worn underneath. Fits more like a longer top.
2.0,its over all pretty good for what u pay for but the color fades quickly.
2.0,"Broke after 2nd use, your food has to be frozen if u want to go with no ice. Overall other then being able to fold down i didnt find it much different then the cheapie white ice chests"
2.0,The length is too long but the waist is somewhat small.
2.0,"Beautiful sun glasses, good strong material but the lenses are too dark"
2.0,Packaging was damaged and watch was covered in dust when it arrived. I was disappointed because this was supposed to be a gift.
2.0,"This dress did not arrive within the 2 days with prime, it was a week. That was fine because I was not in a rush, I was excited to try it on. I ordered the black and white print in a medium. As soon as I took the dress out of the wrap I noticed small brown stains on the white fabric near the waistline. Bummed, I knew it would have to go back. To see about sizing I tried it on and it fit very well. I am 5'2, so it hit a little longer than I was hoping, but did hit where I was expecting due to my shortness, right at my knee. It was comfy and stretchy, I likely would have kept it if it had looked new and clean."
2.0,i was so excited for these and i loved the color but they are see through!
2.0,"I ordered this shirt thinking it would be as beautiful as what is pictured & it just wasn‚Äôt. I was thoroughly disappointed. The picture makes it look flowy & elegant, but in real life the fabric felt stiff & just looked awkward. The ruffled sleeves kind of reminded me of a clown outfit or something similar. The Crochet detail was still beautiful, but it‚Äôs not lace. The color does not match what is pictured either. The picture shows a pretty pink, & this shirt was more of a washed out pink, like a ‚Äúblush‚Äù color I guess. It wasn‚Äôt flowy, because the circumference of the bottom of the shirt seemed to be smaller than the top. It was much shorter in length than expected as well."
2.0,"i have 4 pair of vionic sandals and know that I need to order a size 8 (I am normally 8 1/2 or 9) . Even so I ordered a 9 and found my feet slipped to the front. Returned them and got a pair locally in size 8, but again I was sliding toward the front. Unless Vionic hit the right part of your heel and instep it makes it very uncomfortable. I have Prantar F. and could walk in my VIONIC sandals all day and was hoping these slippers would be just as good at home on my wood floors. Afraid not, so I just wear my sandals around the house, with socks when it gets cold.  Disappointed since they were so fuzzy and comfy when I first put them on, until you walk!"
2.0,The sewing of the seams is Sub-Sub-Sub-Par.  I washed these in Cold water and laid them flat to dry.  After three washings all the seams are pulling apart.
2.0,This dress is really pretty as appears as pictured but runs super small. I typically wear a 16 ladies and ordered a 3X but it is at least 3 sizes to small in the chest area.
2.0,"The neck opening is too large, so one's neck and upper chest get cold, defeating the purpose of a flannel nightgown. Shrinkage is also a considerable negative. After a few washings the sleeves were many inches too short."
2.0,"Shoes looks cool, but I was struggling to put baby's leg inside, as the bottom velcro is decorative, and the leg just stuck there. So my baby couldn't wear them at all."
2.0,Beautiful colors! Not so great quality. multiple bands had the pins fall off making them useless. They are also only one size (my fault I didnt check the size) but they are HUGE like man sized only. I have tiny wrists so these just aren't good. I ended up punching extra holes and trimming the ones that didnt break.
2.0,"not soft, low quality"
2.0,Shoes in good shape and pretty just ran small. So my baby couldn't fit them
2.0,Not a good choice in material. It's the stretchy synthetic material that can make you feel overheated. And while the top is loosely fit the bottom is tightly sewn.
2.0,I ordered big kid size and it‚Äôs fitting the same as my other daughters toddler size
2.0,Broke within a week trap door
2.0,"Actloe‚Äôs sizing seems to be all over the place. This particular sweatshirt runs small, but other hoodies of theirs run big. It seems to be a guessing game.<br /><br />The measurements for the size large are: 21‚Äù wide (42‚Äù total), and 27‚Äù long. The hem at the waist narrows slightly. I washed and tumble dried this sweatshirt on low without any noticeable shrinking or pilling.<br /><br />This sweatshirt isn‚Äôt the most flattering to wear. I‚Äôve tried a few Actloe sweatshirts so maybe it‚Äôs me, but I end up looking like a tubby panda in everything from this brand. The sweatshirt is also kind of noisy, with the black quilted area on the front making scratchy noises everytime I move. The polyester there is stiff; I know I‚Äôm wearing it, if that makes sense.<br /><br />The biggest plus is that the sweatshirts are warm, so they‚Äôre great for wearing in the house in the winter. It‚Äôs made in China from 100% polyester. The fur does shed on clothing even after washing, and also picks up lint/fuzz."
2.0,"The dress is okay. It‚Äôs pretty darn short, though. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äù2‚Äô and I can‚Äôt raise my arms with it on. The tie in the front is also pretty awkward. It‚Äôs just meh, I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again."
2.0,Did not buy at Amazon buy the pendant ans the type is super small1 Need a magnifying glass to read it!!!
2.0,I have ordered a bunch of gloves off of Amazon in the past. I mostly use them for working with dirty things like car parts and outdoor work. These were the most terrible gloves I have ever ordered. They were so thin that even touching a surface outside toward the fingertips. I‚Äôm tempted to throw them in the trash but I don‚Äôt want to waste money.
2.0,The fabric feels super weird‚Äînot soft. It runs large and does not quite look like the photo. I‚Äôm not going to return it because it‚Äôs fine to wear around the house but I wouldn‚Äôt wear out of the house because it looks and feels cheap. I‚Äôm scared to wash it with anything else in fear it will run üòÜ. Good luck. Not worth it.
2.0,Fabric was more like a really thick t-shirt and made the over-all look of the dress very casual. After I returned this and received a full refund my credit card was fraudulently used from this site multiple times. Would not recommend this company if you don‚Äôt want to be hacked.
2.0,"You can see through the dress really easily, so wearing a bra and underwear is a nightmare"
2.0,"sleeves are huge, the body is too short, its just a weird shape"
2.0,Great product all the way up till I noticed the snap back on the queens isn't sewed in
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. The chest was too tight for me and it was entirely too short. For reference, I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù and about 210 pounds. I normally wear a size L, but got an Xl In this dress."
2.0,Runs very small / short.
2.0,"Not ‚Äúsheer‚Äù, material is cheap. Doesn‚Äôt lay nicely. Also, I wish I didn‚Äôt listen to the reviews on here that they run small, because they don‚Äôt."
2.0,"After my kids saying ‚Äúthis is the best stuff‚Äù, we bought 2 of these kits. The liquid initially smells nice but then gets this funky old odor. The cloth always has a dirty smell despite real washing it. Brush was okay but nothing special. Don‚Äôt see what all the fuss is about."
2.0,These are the most uncomfortable workout pants I have ever worn. I purchased my normal size and the waist constantly rolls down. They are not squat proof either. Very disappointed!
2.0,"I had bought this brand of aprons before and really liked them. These however, as soon as I washed them were so wrinkled I couldn't even iron them out."
2.0,"Can't tie by your self. Cheap. Always slid down, did not stay in place. Did the job for single use then tossed in the teash."
2.0,Color changed on it weeks later
2.0,"I received this dress on 3/20/17 early delivery the only good thing. I was so disapointed with this dress, it looks nothing like the picture the length on the dress was to short and it looks like the dress was made by someone who were just learning how to sew. I will not buy from this store again. The picture is pretty but the dress is a mess in person, please do not waste your money."
2.0,Fits cute but this isn‚Äôt beige. Haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôll return it just yet.
2.0,"These fit well, but do not ride in them on hot days!  Sweat marks and felt sticky after."
2.0,Some of the grommets started to tear fabric after about two months. And I wasn't wearing it tight.
2.0,"I am giving 2 stars because the look of the out fit and accessories it comes with is cute.  It doesn't get any ither stars because the first and only day she wore it it fell apart, the bottom stitching came off,  the stitching at the hip came off.  I spent a decent amount of money for a costume to last 30 minutes."
2.0,The wallet is beautiful. Just wished that is was a little larger. I was unable to fit all my credit cards! Other then that it's what I expected. I am updating this wallet. I used it for 6 months &the zipper where you open & close has almost ripped off which when that happens no longer will be able to open the wallet!! That's why I changed it to 2 stars! Very disappointed!!!
2.0,"I 5'6&#34; tall, 127#, I ordered a small. I have other shirts in this style, other brands that fit perfect and look on me just like the picture, however this one fits me like I'm wearing a trash bag! I don't know who these women are that say this &#34;fits as expected&#34; or is &#34;true to size&#34;, It is neither, I had to double check that I had not ordered a Medium. as that is what it fit like."
2.0,"These leggings do not stay up. I found myself constantly pulling them back up. Wish I hadn‚Äôt removed the tags, so I could return."
2.0,"Fits on the smallish side, fabric is light with no stretch at all. Washed in cold and hung to dry and still shrunk about 2 sizes. Bummer."
2.0,"The leather is stiff and poorly tanned,  while the sticking came out at various points after a few wearings. it pays to be able to try gloves before you buy them."
2.0,"This Jacket is over priced. It is thinner than a sweater. The measure scale is too complicated. You have a large room for error. I would for sure read the negative reviews first before purchasing this. They are not completely honest with there description. It's just the surface information they discribe. That surface information is correct, but the jacket is cheap and you will be spending to much for it."
2.0,Battery is dying only after a month. The time is slow so eventually it doesn‚Äôt tell the correct time.
2.0,See threw and no elastic in the waist but they were pretty cheap s I meh
2.0,Not a blanket scarf tiny
2.0,It is a beautiful bracelet and was as described but it broke after two days of wearing.  I am sad because it was such a pretty bracelet.
2.0,"I thought these were very cute to get for my babygirl To wear when she was Atleast 6 months but when I received them it looked like they fit me perfectly. They were way too large, I ended up returning them."
2.0,The ruffles are kinda of flappy
2.0,2 out of the 3 pairs came out broken in the package and one of them broke while trying to put it in the shoe. I ended up returning them and just got the actual wooden ones which are pricey but definitely better in quality.
2.0,They are pretty. Unfortunately the backs don't screw on very far so they droop.
2.0,"If you're thinking the image is accurate, be warned, they're tinged with purple - in my case, one darker than the other.  (?)  They're nicely made, with a notched stud - no basket, so the cone comprising the crystal will bore into your earlobe.  These, I think, will scratch up your phone, so you might consider wearing only one."
2.0,"I bought this band to replace the original which had torn at the part that connects to the Gearfit itself. This one did the same thing in just two months. The clasp was also coming undone constantly, although I switched holes and wrists, and it happened whether or not I bumped it on anything (i.e. going into your pocket, my kids grabbing my hand, etc.). Disappointed."
2.0,gloves are not water proof
2.0,Was too big on me and didn‚Äôt like fabric. Will be returning.
2.0,"Good snug fit, easy to put on. Great color. Closure digs into the wrist more than the original band. Stopped wearing it after a week. The metal clasp digs into your wrist, even when its on a loose fitting. Bending the wrist puts it into the clasp and leaves marks on you as it digs in, super uncomfortable"
2.0,Too small in the chest.  It was a little cheap material and the buttons going all the way down the front have threads on them.
2.0,"The small package came crushed, thought the earrings looked intact. But then the earrings would not close. It was not worth sending back for the price. I did think that they were beautiful but would not buy again."
2.0,"I feel like this runs a tad small, also shrinks so deff up size"
2.0,"Fit great when it came, but the first time I washed it, it shrunk at least 3 sizes"
2.0,"It looks great, However, I only wore it 5 times and the latch stopped working, and the bracelet kept falling off my wrist all the time!"
2.0,Too short and too small after one wash
2.0,"I purchased sterling silver charm bracelets for my daughters when they were babies and twice a year (on Christmas and Valentines Day), I buy charms which represent an event or milestone in their lives for that past year. This Christmas, I purchased a Costa Rica charm for the eldest as a remberance of her trip a few months earlier. Unfortunately, the charm is the poorest that I have bought on Amazon.<br /><br />The charm itself looks cheap and tin-like - not the usual quality that Amazon carries. The front looks dull (it doesn‚Äôt have a high polish like other sterling silver charms) and the back is unfinished as well as cut back so the charm feels flimsy and light. In fact, although it is larger than many of her other charms, it is by far the most light weight. I am giving it two stars as opposed to one because a charm that says ‚ÄúCosta Rica‚Äù is difficult to find but if you have a choice, you may want to disregard this one."
2.0,Extremely fragile.  The clasp just breaks off.
2.0,Didn't realize the knockoffs would look so different than the original Lokai - though I did realize they were knockoffs...
2.0,"They are very nice beads. Unfortunately, one of them broke on the 2nd day worn. Wasn't caught on anything. It just broke and beads everywhere. Disappointed."
2.0,They were super snuggly at first. Kept my feet warm and cool while I was in the house. I wore them occasionally since I received them at the end of November.<br /><br /> Unfortunately they just broke. After 3 months of occasional wear only in the house. Would think they would have more life than just a few months.
2.0,I really think these sun glasses are so cute. I pulled them out of the box and was so excited. Even better looking in person. There is a major issue with them though. The one of the lenses didn‚Äôt fit right in the frame. I know I‚Äôm going to have issues with it.
2.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): Unfortunately the posts on these earrings are way too thick for me to even get in my earring holes, rendering them totally unwearable for me.  Otherwise, I find these earrings absolutely beautiful.  The multi-colored stones against the rose gold background is lovely."
2.0,Very cute and comfortable but makes a very loud whooshing noise every time I walk.
2.0,Son muy lindo pero uno de lo aretes lleg√≥ da√±ado üëéüèª
2.0,doesnt fit right
2.0,Love the print<br />Bottom fit ok too wasn‚Äôt even close to going on 40h
2.0,the colors are nice but its very 'raggy' and looks very cheap.
2.0,"The ears are even closer than the picture looks. Right on top of your head. And the thought behind the tail is beyond me. It's formed into a permanent kink. Doesn't look like a tail at all, or anything like the picture. And no way to attach it. Returning."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:e7975845617563bba1b1550d64f5eb92]] They are very cute however I am disappointed because the earings are the same instead of opposite each other like in the photo. Same on each side instead of opposite to frame the face. See my video for expliantion.
2.0,Did not fit right at all I have DD and barely covered them. The adhesive works well but not good support
2.0,"The necklace broke after wearing it once. The charm is a copy of a tattoo that I wanted so my husband bought it for me, but it is really cheap and doesn't even deserve another chain."
2.0,"I Had high hopes these were for sensitive ears like the hoops I'd bought from this same company, Which I love by the way! Those other hoops they sell have been the only ones that don't itch and burn my ears that I have tried in years, only reason I tried these is that they are smaller and a little different style. Did not work, not only are they not for sensitive ears, the posts are too thick to even put in my holes, they hurt."
2.0,"These sunglasses are very light which could be a benefit to some but I'm not a fan of that.  I also have an issue where the lenses don't meet the frames in the center. It's nothing more than a centimeter or two but it's poor craftsmanship for sure. Other than that, I like the size and shape of them."
2.0,Screws get really loose.
2.0,UPDATE‚Äî‚ÄîI returned these jeans because 4 buttons fell off. I received a new pair to have 2 buttons fall off AGAIN.<br />Very cute fit. Just way to long for someone who is only 5‚Äô2
2.0,LOVE the color and idea; however they have an awful chemical smell and a one of the handles snapped off easily prior to even getting on the plane :(
2.0,It just wasn't as pictured. The pendent in the pictures much larger and a more vibrant color. What I got was small and not worth the money I paid. I returned it
2.0,Fabric is THICK....i feel like a walking sleeping bag
2.0,I returned as soon as I tried on- even w adjustments they are way too big for my head. Only get for a boy if he's already near full grown or a woman if avg-lg men's hats fit you. Too loose to tell if they'd be warm or protect from wind.
2.0,beautiful color. a little short and small in size. the 2 star is how hard it  was to return. the too small size
2.0,Worked nicely for six whole months...
2.0,"Very thin , poor quality.  If you are looking for a dress that will only last one night, this is the dress."
2.0,credit card slots are too small and not enough pockets very disappointed.
2.0,Not worth it. Sandal straps dig into my ankles causing bad chaffing. Skip these and get something else. Not as comfortable as others in the same price range.
2.0,"The dress really doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. IMO. And I u detest ads it runs small, but I can‚Äôt believe how small it runs. I usually wear a size 2X, I order a 3X, because I read the comments of it running small. I can get over me, but the chest area is way too tight. Not really happy about this purchase."
2.0,"These glasses were 'ok'.  The quality made me feel like they are worse than those from a rest stop on the highway, and more of a $9.99 item (listed as $18.99 when I purchased).  These are a fixed frame and nosepiece, so you can't adjust at all.  The nosepiece makes these glasses hit or miss, in my opinion.  If they fit better, I probably would have kept them regardless of paying 2x as much as I think the quality deserves."
2.0,This is going back. It runs small in size as well as volume of material. Size up for sure. Not worth the price..
2.0,Nice shorts but no button at all on them to button them closed :-(
2.0,"I love the color and material, but it's way to short to wear as a dress and too long to wear as a long shirt with leggings. The only thing wrong is that its too short otherwise it fits."
2.0,Too see through. It was flattering but cheap. I returned it. If any color would work it would be black not white
2.0,Looks cheap but less expensive than the Halloween costume stores
2.0,"I didn't like how the plugs looked as soon as I opened the package. It looked like someone. They don't look much like how I was lead to believe they were supposed to look. Instead of the small granules of color in the photo, I got large shards of it, with mostly black still showing. I am not pleased. This by itself doesn't look bad, but I wish I bought what was advertised."
2.0,"The material is very thin and very short for reference in 5‚Äô7‚Äù, I would not recommend"
2.0,"These didn't fit ANY of my sunglasses. I ended up ripping out the stitching and redoing it to allow more room for my sunglasses (FYI- it is hard to hand stitch neoprene). Other than that, I like the style and fabric."
2.0,Not great quality. Fits somehow big even though I ordered it based on the suggested size.
2.0,Need my refund
2.0,cute but too large and even reading all reviews still too big one or 2 sizes up but no telling until u get them and have to pay to return them
2.0,just didn't like them.
2.0,Runs way too small size is not accurate
2.0,These glasses do not block out much sun glare. They do fit over regular eye glasses  & do look stylish but I still squint. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Not sure what all the excitement is about.  If you want comfort, keep looking, you won't find it here. Very disappointing.  Would not buy again."
2.0,I liked the logo.  The apron is too short.  Also the fabric is too thin.  Would not order again.  More like a novelty item.
2.0,"I wanted to love this. But busty ladies, beware. The cups are awkwardly sewn in and so there was a seam across my boobs and the cups couldn‚Äôt be moved. I‚Äôm about a 34G/H and the fit would have been great had that not been an issue!"
2.0,"These pants are really nice. All the accents look great. The problem is that run small even for Junior sizes. The lighter colored material on these pants is thinner then tee-shirt material. They ripped the first time my daughter wore them. We love the style and design, just wish they came in larger sizes and that we were aware of them running small and that part of the material on these pants is not sturdy or durable. We thought these were women's sizes. Really cute design though!"
2.0,The material doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúgive‚Äù to it. I find it very tight in the chest and arm areas. The design is a great concept but unfortunately needs a lot of work to make this a comfortable top. Was really looking forward to it. :(
2.0,The wiring is poorly done. It keeps breaking and my S.O. keeps fixing the darn thing! Our poor kid absolutely freaked when he unwrapped it since he is a big Ghostbusters fan; got to play a whole 5mins out of a week of having it since it was for his birthday.
2.0,Fabric is very thin and looks cheap. I returned this shirt.
2.0,"Purchased this top a couple months ago and was waiting for the weather to get warmer to wear it. I was finally going to wear it and noticed it has a hole on the neckline. It is a cute top and I really like how it fits and the color. Unfortunately, since I waited to wear it, it is now outside the return window."
2.0,The coloring on the side rubbed off with little to no use of the product. Supposed to look nice and did but did not last long enough not even for the price point. Pretty disappointing.
2.0,I ordered the size 5-6 and it looked too small on my son.
2.0,"Product came on time, but was tarnished already.<br />Really disappointed...."
2.0,"When I first tried them on, these pants seemed great. They are very comfortable and soft. However, when I worked out in them, they did not hold anything tight - meaning they are not very stretchy. They are very thin. Also, after only 4 washings, they are pilling like crazy and every piece of lint sticks to them!"
2.0,Used them each for about 2 days and then the bands started coming off because the medal pins that comes with it to keep the band on the watch face aren't quite long enough so it constantly (as in MULTIPLE TIMES A MINUTE) would fall off my wrist. Good color and rubber material.
2.0,"These are not as picture, gloves are not elbow length as picture, they reach up a bit past the wrist below the elbow"
2.0,arrived 3 weeks late otherwise good gift
2.0,They look imitation.
2.0,"First off... the color of this dress compared to what I (thought) I ordered is laughable. It is basically the color of my skin, compared to a orangey-pink as show on the listing. The material itself feels like a swimsuit and it is the strangest blend of polyester/spandex. I order 2X (I normally wear between a L/XL) and the dress fit as expected - so size up people. Would not encourage you to buy this ""Pink"" one though unless you have a complextion/skin tone to contrast. Will be returning."
2.0,"The color was more of a beige and the material, even though the tag stated ""cotton"", there was no way it was cotton.  I did not even try the dress on due to these two factors.  Returned."
2.0,Poor quality didnt survive a whole day with my grandson
2.0,Cute but cheap. The latex band is too short and hard to put on.
2.0,I love this keychain except that the screws holding it together keeps coming loose and the two pieces separate.
2.0,"The fabric seemed to be a magnet for lint and fuzz, but overall a comfortable pant."
2.0,There are adorable and fit my 3yrld very well with a little room to grow but they have only been worn for dress up play 4 times and the pearl and bows are falling apart very disappointed.
2.0,"Very small on the waist, and I'm a skinny guy.  I ordered an extra large, and they are long enough. Very shoddy quality, with black strings hanging everywhere. Material feels fine, but I have to keep cutting strings that ravel. Poorly constructed, and looks a little strange from the front."
2.0,"The glasses are built well for the price, but they do very little to improve night vision."
2.0,Ordered a large and fit like a medium.
2.0,These are not for girls with bigger thighs. Did not fit and I am a 12.
2.0,"I brought two different sizes because I am between sizes.  The dress was‚Äôt flattering.  The material was very thin and was flaking.  Also, the sleeves don‚Äôt stay down.  I had to return it."
2.0,Beautiful verse and font but too large and cheaply made. It had a dingy looking white color and was returned the same day!
2.0,Cute design but super thin and no elastic in the waist. They kept falling down.
2.0,"Falls off and shifts around so easily. The band snags on a lot of my clothes. Also, magnet came off of one side."
2.0,It doesn't hang anything like the picture.  It's a bit ... strange fitting.  I'll probably just wear it around the house.
2.0,"Cute / nice quality pants  , but runs small... extremely tight on myself. I purchased the light blue color and they really do lift your butt however The bra is less than average. Wasn‚Äôt crazy about it.<br />Would order pants again and size up.... if I could I would opt out purchasing another bra/top."
2.0,"Cute colors but the will slip off without body adhesive... Actually im not even sure if that may work even. I have thick thighs so even thiugh the stockings fit fine, my mistake was not looking for thigh highs without the ribber astic in them to keep them up because these defiantly dont come with them. Kinda a waste of money if you ask me. :/"
2.0,Did not meet my expectations.  Were cheap looking  Very stiff
2.0,Blazer was cute but I couldn't wear it. The sleeves were very tight. Returned.
2.0,"I read how these would be huge so I'm not surprised by how large they were. I'm disappointed because even with being so big, I can't get them to fit over my glasses. There is a nose piece that gets in the way. I need to see if they can be returned. My only prime day purchase..."
2.0,"I purchased a set of four of your Glasses Holders from Amazon on November 23, 2019. I only use glasses for reading which is a few hours per day.<br />  Three of the holders have had the o ring that goes around the frame break. The last time this happened my reading glasses ended up on the floor.<br />  I like the product. It is comfortable to use and easy to adjust. The only problem is that the o rings fail way too soon."
2.0,"This shirt fits like any other tshirt I would buy in my size, not at all oversized.  If you don‚Äôt care about it being oversized as advertised then it‚Äôs a fine quality plain tshirt"
2.0,"Cleaner was leaking in the package once it arrived. Due to the dark bottle, I‚Äôm not certain how much was lost. Cure does really well on ultraboost except for the sole."
2.0,"Very cute and soft, the zipper on the Butt busted out tho"
2.0,This wig color is yellowish and the top of hair is very awkward. The fit is good and it compliments a young teens head to an adult.  Overall not satisfied because I'll need to look for another one
2.0,"Supposed to be good to below zero temps. Lasted 20 min in 15 degree weather before my hands felt frozen. Did stay dry, though."
2.0,Used for operating equipment only and palm of left glove has split after 2 months or less use.
2.0,The hair band is shiny and pretty at first look but is cheaply attached and came already broken. I have put about 20 minutes of effort so far into fixing it but have been unable to do so.  I was disapointed.
2.0,"Update: After less than a month, the decorative bead has separated from the post on the pair I wear most often requiring repair. I take them off nightly.  I have probably worn them 12 times.  I loved these at first, but now I am not sure.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I love these! They are 6 pairs of earrings in one package.  I put them in backwards and wear the larger size end for a dramatic effect."
2.0,The material is cheap and ripped along seams after a couple of wears!!!¬π
2.0,"I'm 144lbs, 5'5, 34b. I really wanted to love this dress. Unfortunately it was so large that I couldn't pull it off. The extra room was very apparent, and especially in the chest. I had several inches of extra room under my armpits. The dress hung off me. I ordered a medium. It's very long, so it certainly won't show anything you want covered. Obviously you can cinch it up with the drawstrings. If you order this dress I would size down unless you are full figured. I have been losing weight (35lbs down). With the way this dress fits, I would still recommend sizing down if you are in the 170s-180s. Especially if you aren't well endowed in the chest. The dress is advertised as yellow but is definitely more of an orange. Fabric is thicker than I expected. It wouldn't be see through at all. Because the dress was so big, it's pure speculation, but the fabric and design seems like it could be forgiving if fitted. But I can't guarantee that because it wasn't tight enough on me."
2.0,It was a gift??
2.0,"The sleeves are tight,  the collar doesn't lay down properly when buttoned in the back (wish it had been a full collar). The bottom ruffle will not stay down when walking."
2.0,Too heavy - made my glasses slip down my nose.
2.0,tended to curl and cut off blood flow - just the opposite of what u want.  recommend buy calf length stockings not these.
2.0,"I ordered these shoes for my daughter who wears a size 1. The reviews didn‚Äôt seem to say much about the shoes running small, so I ordered her exact size. Low and behold, they were too tight. I started the return process and ordered a size 2. Again, they were too small; so I will be returning this pair as well. I will not try again and order another size up. They are beautiful shoes though, but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with the sizing."
2.0,I returned this dress due to the weird flare it produced at my knees and the excessive fabric in the armpit areas. However this dress would have been very cute and sexy had it fit properly! The color was also exactly as pictured.
2.0,The fit is funny because the waist is so big that it makes the skirt bunch up.
2.0,These shirt are short. Even ordering a xl to accommodate my chest they sit right at the top of my pants waist. Not what I expected.
2.0,Too small--mid rise not good
2.0,Unfortunately it smells like mildew. Other than that it‚Äôs a nice enough belt.
2.0,Really cute design.  False advertise as plus size.  4 sizes smaller than advertised. Will only fit chest size 34 or smaller.  36 to 40 inch measurements around.
2.0,It was thin.  Fit as Expected.
2.0,"The shirt doesn't look much like the photo at all. It's not as long in the waist area as the photo led me to believe, and I thought I would get a shirt with nice silverish buttons - but they were small, black and plastic. The shirt is plain cotton and more of a bright pink. I'm a little disappointed."
2.0,Cheap material. Way too much material to use as a headband
2.0,Sorry to say not true to size I normally wear a 34DDD and I bought a 34E and it did not fit. Well-made look like a good support. But So I'm returning mine.
2.0,Ordered them in pink but got clear.  üòê
2.0,My daughter didn‚Äôt really like wearing these as slippers because they made her feet to hot. Super cute though!
2.0,I don't know who decided to make these shoes but did they actually try them on first? Because the thickness between the toes is ungodly uncomfortable.
2.0,These fit on the bigger side. I should have got medium.
2.0,Quality craftsmanship with these but they are waaaaay undersized.
2.0,too thick
2.0,"I had been contemplating buying this dress for weeks and finally decided to order it. I was really excited to receive the dress but immediately after taking it out of the package I was disappointed.  It had lint on it out of the package and fit very oddly.  I am<br />a very busty hourglass and normally wear a size 8 and bought a M. The dress fit comfortably around my boobs and then was very loose everywhere else. It almost looked stretched out around the hip area. I thought it looked like a tent but a family member, it looked like a mumu.  I could go down to a size small, and  I‚Äôm sure it would look better but I‚Äôm not going to try it again."
2.0,"I purchased this item for my wife for obvious reasons (2) to be exact.<br />When it arrived she like it based on the thought behind it, however neither her nor I would have purchased it had we seen it first hand.<br />The material it is made of is not to our standards in a quality product. Maybe for a dime store, or a flea market, but not for us."
2.0,not that warm
2.0,not wide enough
2.0,pretty but chain was broken
2.0,I bought this because it was pretty and feminine. However it kept falling off. I eventually had lost it because it fell off without me noticing it. Quite upset. The closer to keep it closed needs to be a better closer.
2.0,big where should be small and small where they should've been large- just an odd cut. returned
2.0,"It‚Äôs a cute skirt. Held together with Velcro, which wasn‚Äôt ideal."
2.0,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon; I bought mine at DSW.  I love the look and the functionality, but I've only had it for a couple of months and it's falling apart.  The outside pocket (in photo) ripped on the inside after a few weeks, and today the zipper broke off.  I won't buy Sak again.  I expected better.<br /><br />Follow up: DSW replaced my bag with another of the same. I‚Äôm hoping this one lasts longer, and that the defective one was just a fluke. I‚Äôll update again later. I really like this purse, so hoping for the best."
2.0,"This skirt was OK. I really paid attention to the measurement guidelines when ordering, but it still seemed to be a little big on me. I'd say if you're on the cusp of the measurements, then order the next size down? Also, be aware that this skirt rides up CONSTANTLY.  Lots of fit issues..."
2.0,"POORLY PACKAGED....<br />The small, plastic package it came in, is NOT ideal to ship something in, that has wires made within it... The *very flexible* wires in it are very delicate and are easily moved and bend like they're made of twist ties. You see when I hold them up, and the ears bend back.? They're Too Heavy For the small wires inside... The outside of it is soft.. But the INSIDE feels like what a sleeping bag is made of... Look, A couple pieces of cardboard, or a cardboard tube would of been better to put this in before mailing it off through postal.. And it needs to go LONGWAYS.. not wadded up then shoved in a plastic bag... It would of been nice to know also if the price was gonna drop too BEFORE ordering this. ..All In All, I don't see this lasting very long with a little girl... The wires are going to break in it, and she's gonna have a conniption fit... AND I GOTTA TAKE THE HEAT.!!"
2.0,This kimono was shorter and smaller than expected.
2.0,"At first glance the pendant looked fine so I wrapped it up and gifted it. I saw the person I gave it to wearing it yesterday and I noticed that the stencil on the magnifier was crooked and off center which made it hard to project the wording and it really showed when you used a camera to view it. She didn't point it out to me so I wouldn't be disappointed but it was kind of embarrassing to have given her a ""cheap"" item once I found out. I was very disappointed since this was supposed to be a meaningful gift."
2.0,They are not memory foam.  No cushion on feet at all.
2.0,"Not bad for the price but just FYI does come with the name charlie already. My husband is not a charlie but because it cost me under 15 bucks, I will keep. The cartoon man is adorable and looks like hubby which is why I wanted it. But i will have to buy a name tag to put over the charlie."
2.0,I was very excited about this shirt. It felt great and looked good except the neck opening is HUGE. It did not look right at all. If the shirt had fit properly I would have ordered every color.
2.0,Very cute and nice material but I ordered it too big for me.
2.0,"I really want to like these all the way, I like the material, thickness, and deep pockets (even a back pocket!) But when I order joggers, I expect to have a loose fit, which there is, except in the calves. The calf area is oddly fitted. And I don't have large calves. I'll be returning, unfortunately."
2.0,"The material felt weird and I didn't like how it fit, so I returned it."
2.0,"Other reviewers claimed this runs small, but they must either be crazy or have received a different product than I did. It is much too large and literally fell off my body when I tried it on because the opening is so big. I sewed a band across the back to hold it together and on, but it still isn't really wearable. Disappointing, because it has the potential to be cute. The quality is also not what I'd hoped. It had a few loose seams and one of the bits of stitching hadn't been trimmed so there was a huge wad of extra knotted up thread attached to one of the shoulders."
2.0,First of on the color is different than the picture it's not coffee color it's more can a creamy the band gets dirty easily
2.0,I thought this was going to be a nice soft fabric but instead it was very synthetic and cheap feeling. The pattern also wasn't crisp at all and made it look a even cheaper.
2.0,Bigger than I expected. Wanted something smaller.
2.0,I normally check reviews first but I didnt think to with  earrings.  But when I received them one of them was barely attathced to the post and would shift. It hut in my ear and as it was constantly moving and  the second day I wore them it completely broke off .  They were cute but just a waste of money
2.0,Little tight for an xxl
2.0,hurt my wife's ear and could not adjust
2.0,I bought this for my wife. I returned it after she tried wearing it and it kept tightening up around her neck
2.0,You get what you pay for.  If you can't get to a store to actually try on a suit you take your chances. Was to big
2.0,"I'm 5ft tall, 170lbs, and 38DD chest and I ordered a large - it fit perfectly except in my chest. Really didn't look right and it just made them into a shelf lol. Don't really recommend for anyone with a larger chest!"
2.0,It is a mid waist dress....does not come down to the waist. Very unsatisfied
2.0,This smiley faces are cute but they are only good for a bracelet or earrings very small.
2.0,weird fit and where the embroidery is looks misshapen...returned
2.0,I ordered the S/M. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù. 112 lbs. This was WAY too tight and short.  I feared it would rip if I tried to sit down.  Otherwise it was typical costume quality.  Had to return it.
2.0,The  extra large fit like a small
2.0,Its a beautiful hoodie but the sizing is completely wrong!!
2.0,The size was too small. The product was not sticky enough either. May work better for someone with small breasts but definitely not for busty ladies. I never wore this and just threw them away.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:f3383285f37f3dcfcb289eff849aa2cb]] Very nice pair of boots.  Lite material and very strong. But I wouldn't recommend for construction as this are what was described.
2.0,came very wrinkled - and hate to wash it - so hung for 2 weeks and still wrinkled - may have to get a steamer!
2.0,I purchased this for my nephew. Ordered a 0-6 months and its so big it might fit him when he is 1 year old.
2.0,"Cute, but most of them had holes after the first wear"
2.0,"I wore these like forever (on my 3rd pair). Local , travelling, sightseeing the world. I liked the little bit of high-heel, which gave it a dressier look and they worked well in downpours. Then I realized my feet were always killing me, but never attributed it to these sandals, until I started researching plantar fasciitis (sp?) and buying all kinds of products to cure it. I bought a pair of sandals with excellent arch supports and my feet felt like heaven. But I would wear these occasionally to go out and came home with achy feet again. Ding! I still wear them once in a blue moon for short events because I like the look."
2.0,Not happy with the pair I purchased.  One of the cross over straps is longer on the left shoe that the right.  It does not sit flat on my foot.
2.0,This is pretty thin. I can see thru it. I don't think it will afford much protection for my face when skiing.
2.0,"This an excellent watch.  However, one of the main features I use is the count down timer for yacht racing.  There is no &quot;progress beeper&quot; on this watch.  It only beeps when the total time is up; there are no intermediate beeps.  My old Casio PRG-70 -- one of the first ABC watches -- finally failed; it beeped at 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 minutes, followed by 50, 40, 30,20,10, 5, 4,3,2,1, and 0 seconds.  This sequence was excellent for adjusting your boat speed to be at the starting line at top speed when the gun fired.<br /><br />I returned the PRW-3500 for a PRW-2500 which is an earlier version of the PRW-3500 but without the improved sensors.  It does have a progress beeper, but the beep sequence is not as detailed in the final one minute.  It will have to do.<br /><br />Why do Casio engineers and programmers have to keep &quot;improving&quot; on things that were tailored to meet specific sport requirements.  The  PRG-70<br />was sold, among other things, as a yachtsman's watch."
2.0,"I ordered Rose color, but am happy with the look."
2.0,I ordered this for for my wife. I was very disappointed when she opened the package. It was really big 22x16x8. It does not have over the handle pocket and does not look like leather at the bottom.
2.0,The lenses are not correct. They give me a headache after only an hour of working on the computer.  I have used amber readers and amber no magnification glasses before without any problem like this.
2.0,Order 2 sizes up a least.  Item runs very small.
2.0,"Very stiff, looks like it might break.. but not as big as it looks in the pics here.. more maroon, less red.. I am returning, looks flimsy"
2.0,It wasn't what I expected. It came in smaller then I thought.
2.0,Wore it to Oktoberfest a total of about 3 times before the seams started to come undone. Split down the middle seam and coin pocket.
2.0,"These belts are awful. I was part of the Kickstarter, really cool concept but bad execution. The belt material is way too rough, the buckle looks tacky, it feels like you‚Äôre wearing a potato sack as a belt. The magnet thing, neat idea, but in practice it‚Äôs not a smooth experience. 2 stars because it holds pants up, but so does an electrical outlet or a lightning cable. With the lightning cable you‚Äôll look just as ridiculous but at least your phone will be charged."
2.0,just great for taking pictures  not as comfortable.
2.0,Unfortunately this was not flattering on me the back hangs like it wasn't sewn
2.0,"Something is not right with the way this was made, got it a wile just couldn't wear it."
2.0,"I read the reviews and took my chances! To start after the first wash one of the cargo pockets fell off in the wash, had several loose/stray threads. The size fit as expected, one of the pockets on the shirt came undone cause the stitching was poorly done. Don't care for the stings to tie behind the back. The side panel and neck trim material is scratchy and uncomfortable, especially if you start to sweat! I've worn mine once and will only wear it as a last resort!!"
2.0,"Quality is as expected for the price.  However, color is completely off.  The deep red polka dot tie in the picture turns out to be a very light orange-ish red."
2.0,Tthin material that fits too tight.
2.0,Very cheap looking. Not good quality.
2.0,"The manufacturer needs to go back to their drawing board.  The supposed cargo shorts I received is not the same as described nor as pictured.  It states ‚Äúone-zip closure pocket‚Äù.  There are no zippers on these shorts.  There are also no cuffs like the picture.  It states it can be worn as mid-rise (below the true waist), but if I do that, the crotch seam is way below where it‚Äôs supposed to be.  The back pockets are fake flaps.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because the material is good quality.  Otherwise, I would not recommend purchasing this until it‚Äôs redesigned."
2.0,"These glasses are designed to only fit those with really wide spaced eyes.  I tried bending the nose bridge but that didn‚Äôt help.  And the nose grippy things are really hard to adjust.  The way they came they are about 1.5 inches apart, not good if you have a thin nose."
2.0,Made of very thin fabric and fits very small
2.0,"Cute but look like they are 10 yrs old already and they are not water proof, more like water logged. Very disappointed!!!!"
2.0,fabric (thin) and fit (too tight)
2.0,What a waste of money. hard to figure out to put on. all twisted trying to get it on. I simply hate this thing! wish I'd have never bought it. it is a beautiful color. too bad it's a PITA to put on. too tight but bigger would have been too lose. this thing needs instructions. I don't recommend it. going to see about returning it
2.0,Earrings did tarnish and I didn't even wear them a lot. Sadly disappointed.
2.0,Runs very small their XL is a normal small - not sure where they get their sizing.
2.0,"I wanted this to be perfect - it was for my daughter's Elsa costume. It would have been great - but it was just poorly put together. The actual crown piece looked nice, but it was mounted off-center on the tiara, so it looked strange on her head. We had to return it."
2.0,I returned this ring... it just was not comfortable.
2.0,The pants and slippers fit ad expected but the top was a little small
2.0,Curve fit the watch perfectly. Paint started coming off days after I started wearing it. I would NOT buy this again. Even though it was not expensive it was not worth the price.
2.0,One of the temples broke from the hinge within two weeks of getting them. I thought it was just a loose screw but it was just broken no way to possible repair it.
2.0,A little stiffer than what I was thinking and my glasses fall out of the &#34;holder&#34;
2.0,Not what I expected very small n and it's like a child's bag disappointed
2.0,I was so happy this shirt was perfect. After one week the fabric twore and there is now a hole in my shirt I‚Äôm pretty upset that a brand new shirt already got a hole in it. Like WTH? Is it that cheaply made or what?
2.0,Fits too big. Need an inner seam drawstring to size the body properly
2.0,"Soft. Inconsistent hat size, probably due to the cheap production quality. One is almost too small for 3 year old, and the others barely fit an adult."
2.0,"The size option said it fits from XS to M but the ones I got said M in the bags, and I'm a size S. Also I used mine under the jeans, thanks God I did it so, because when I got out, the cold  was getting to my skin as if I were naked."
2.0,"The ball is huge, it doesn't look that big in the picture. They are still cute kind of .... but with the ball being so big I won't be wearing them much, shame cause I like them otherwise"
2.0,Really tight on my thighs  :( I'm 5'3 110 shouldn't be that tight
2.0,"When I bought this item, it was advertised as including a skirt and socks as well. However, I only received a shirt. I see now that they've included an option labelled whole set, but this was not listed when I first saw the item. The shirt itself is fine."
2.0,"I was really excited about them, but they were too flimsy and small to put in my cartilage. I didn't even attempt, had to return them. :( they would be beautiful for an earlobe piercing though"
2.0,Big and cheap plastic pearls very uncomfortable
2.0,Belt  broke the first month!
2.0,They are cheap made and the charms some are broke
2.0,Gave this to my son for Christmas and by late January the seam on the sleeve is already tearing.
2.0,"Well made hat but smaller than advertised.  Listing said 20-27&#34;, I measured my head at 24&#34; and the hat I received was way too small for me."
2.0,Not a very quality product. Disappointed
2.0,Hard to put on and doesn't stay on üòî
2.0,"Liked the quality.  Good material, but the size fit tight in the butt/crotch area.  I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù 220 and the XL fit like a large.  The side color is much brighter and significant than I expected as well.  I wanted baggier between the legs.  I may try a XXL but the XL was returned."
2.0,"Material across the top of the foot, where the rubber and fabric intersect, scrapes the foot and is uncomfortable."
2.0,"This shirt looks very different from the picture. It's a lot bagger, and not fitted. It's rather cheap looking. I would not recommend this shirt to anyone. Instead of looking trendy and cute, I looked like I was going to do some gardening."
2.0,String is very thing and the bracelet comes loose and falls off. Not happy at all.
2.0,These pants are a lightweight material but they are not sweatpants.  I ordered a medium and these are XXL.
2.0,I didn't find this dress to be as cute as the picture. I still kept it though.
2.0,"I guess you get what you pay for, but this necklace is very cheap looking. I purchased other necklaces here for around the same price and they are amazing. Skip this one unless you want it for a young girl and you don't care if it breaks."
2.0,"I'm 5'7 and 140# so I ordered a medium.  The shirt length and overall fit was fine.  I wear a D cup and the shirt felt too tight under my arm pits,  which was a little annoying. The sleeves were too short, which was the deal breaker."
2.0,shirt is scratchy
2.0,"The color is nice, but it does run large. I would recommend getting a size smaller. Unfortunately for myself, there wasn‚Äôt an XS available for me"
2.0,Too small. It looks way bigger in the photos
2.0,Fit was not as expected. Dress was too short.
2.0,"The moccasins are nice. But because they were not advertised as being United Kingdom sized. Unknowingly I ordered a size 10. Assuming that they were U.S. sized. When I received them,they did not fit. When I contacted Snugrugs customer service they would not accept their responsibility for THEIR MISREPRESENTATION. And made me pay the return shipping. Even though I feel it should have been their responsibility."
2.0,I can already tell the product isn't going to last long. After my daughter wore this hair time 1 time it was already starting to lose its elasticity.
2.0,"Closer is OKAY,  but the opener is very poor quality.<br />Pins are cheap and adjustable spacer is hard to move."
2.0,"I love the idea of this coat for a casual run around but it looks like a your wearing a comforter .. it also arrived with a broken zipper .. I ordered the green, it is a nice color .. probably would look good on a smaller, or slim person .. I‚Äôm 5.9 and  ordered size extra large"
2.0,Material is extremely thin and zipper is difficult to close.
2.0,"about one third of the keychains don't snap together or won't stay snapped together. They are inexpensive though,  so just realize you won't be able to use all 50 in a package."
2.0,"Looks super cheap, like the kind you get at the dollar store."
2.0,Quality of logo left a lot to be desired.
2.0,The clip on the shoulder strap is already broke and I have had it for only 9 days!  Hoping to figure out how to get ahold of the company because I love the purse!
2.0,"Thin material. Bought an XL, fits like a medium."
2.0,Not a true XL size. More like a Medium.
2.0,"The fabric was stiff and hard, it almost seems like the pattern was painted on. Not very comfortable and pretty unforgiving. Not for you if you want a comfy soft sweatshirt."
2.0,"I needed something cheap and quick because I order some reals from a different site were taking a while with delivery. These will hold until then,the belly rings are not meant for long time wear or to swim with."
2.0,Poor quality.  Zipper was not attached across the entire bag.
2.0,"Super cute, but super tight..  was hoping the leather straps would loosen after wear, but not so much."
2.0,"Really like this band at first, especially for the price. Then I wore it in the ocean. Immediately corrosion build up in metal adjustable parts. Returning while still eligible."
2.0,"This material is sheer but not see through. The scoop neck and back make it fit bigger, exposing a lot of cleavage. I would recommend a small size."
2.0,"It looked like good quality leather but its already tore up, and I ordered this in dec of last year 2015. I am very disappointed! I won't ordered this again"
2.0,They were too small and when i put war loop adjusters it made the mask fit awkward . Didn‚Äôt fit my 5 or 7 year old. The quality was good though
2.0,"Not as thick of material as I was hoping for.  Started pilling quickly and it's a little short for me.  I'm 5' 4"" and I ordered a medium."
2.0,the blouses was very small
2.0,material too thin.
2.0,"At least 2 sizes too small, had to return it."
2.0,These are so tiny that they should be sold as kid gloves.
2.0,I ordered 4-5T and was sent size 90 which according to the size chart is 12-18 months. The quality seems okay but because of the sizing I'll be returning it
2.0,The material  is uncomfortable
2.0,These broke right away. Very cheap.
2.0,"Too snug on the face for my 9, 6, and 4 year old. Ear holes weren't ideal. Worked better without worrying about the ear holes."
2.0,this hat was much too small for average adult head. It fit my 5 year old granddaughter
2.0,"Just be careful wearing it with any other colors than black, because the black color comes off when in contact with other things, especially fabrics. Its a nice style, though."
2.0,The velcro sticks to my hair. I could have made this.
2.0,Color has ran on other sleeves and can‚Äôt wear some
2.0,This earring is too small to work as a daith earring it does not appear to be a heart when worn.
2.0,Material is thin. Elastic already snapping after one wear. Got what I paid for.
2.0,"These are only 7% spandex, not 10%."
2.0,"Very cheaply made, you get what you pay for.  Almost seem cheaper looking than a dollar store so I plan to donate them.  Look like they would fall apart not long after wearing them.  I like to wash my slippers and I believe if these were washed they for sure would fall apart, but I didn't wash them so can say for sure.  I actually purchased for my grand kids and will not be giving them to them."
2.0,Was not true to size. Order up at least one size. Not very flexible. Material is pretty snug. Cute shirt though.
2.0,you can see through this blouse
2.0,I absolutely loved it but it doesn't work and my daughter didn't get the label printed out in time. If it worked it would be an awesome buy.
2.0,"Cheaply made, already falling apart, dislike feel of material"
2.0,"I collect ""Evil Eye"" items and decided to try this bracelet as it looked thinner than most and could be worn with other bracelets.  When it arrived, I had to look carefully to be sure that the ""Eyes"" were really there!  They are so tiny that a casual viewer would wonder what they are.  To add to the disappointment, one of the eyes fell out and I am left with an open space.  I doubt they were wired in.  A very disappointing item.  Will not order from Bling again."
2.0,didn't get to wear it. It broke right out of the box.
2.0,The rhinestones fell off after 2 hours of wear.<br />I do not recommend these.
2.0,It was cute but smaller than expected.
2.0,This material is extremely thin and very unforgiving of every bump and bulge.  I would never buy this product again.  It arrived bundled up in a ball and wrinkled.  Material so cheap I'm nervous to iron it for fear it will dissolve.
2.0,"Rather pretty, but I'm on my third. The flower keeps coming off after a couple months."
2.0,Delicate is right  Too delicate for a grown women.The pins which allow or don't  allow you to push the pins through the  ear are so small that putting  the earrings on is IMPOSSIBLE. I've now disposed of three pair from asian country and they are all the same. When the pins are pushed and you have to try they bend and are useless. The same as short hooks also useless. Why skimp with the most . part. Wise up friends from the east or west. Hooks have to be longer and pins MUST BE longer or like me money is wasted. NEVER AGAIN FOR ME.
2.0,Everything fit fine except the cuffs at the bottom we‚Äôre too big.
2.0,I sent these back.  The fabric was too thin.
2.0,They not true to size. My little one is 13 shoe and they fit like a 2. she loves them so we will keep until she can wear them.
2.0,If your looking for just a thin layer piece then buy them but if you want to wear just the shirt to thin.
2.0,Weird fit.  Ended up returning.
2.0,Cool concept. Totally and completely not well thought out if it does fit out of the box.<br />Tying a knot the top to size makes it ridiculous to try and put on and take off.
2.0,"It was supposed to come with two and I only received 1!! The product is amazing, I love the key chain that I recived, I just wish since I bought the double pack that I would have recived both!!"
2.0,Fit very small had to return it
2.0,Well made and functional but color rubs off pretty easily with normal use. Otherwise would have rated 5 stars
2.0,Was comfortable but not good for safety purposes
2.0,"I loved the design and was so excited to receive these pants and ordered a size medium. I am average height and they fit more like caprese, which was not what I pictured at all. The pants also looked cheaply made, as there were snags all over and the lacing strings were not very durable. I will be returning unfortunately."
2.0,very thin - not of good quality
2.0,Looks nice on the model. Neckline is way too high making it uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,Very cute! I love all the colors and patterns. BUT it was just a little bit difficult to assemble because the paper didn't fold very easily and it was hard to fit the paper into some of the slips on the side.
2.0,Product looks and feels very cheap. Photo is very deceiving.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this band. When I first opened it, the quality seemed too good to be true for the price. Unfortunately, that was actually the case. The leather began to separate within two weeks of wear. However, the tools that came with the band were very helpful and I continue to use them on my other watches. Hopefully, the band that they sent me was just an outlier, but 2 stars (because of the tools) is the best I can do."
2.0,I really want to love these earrings but $100 seems really expensive when they got here. I pictured them with a half carat diamond for size. The sapphire is pretty but it is so small that you can't get a star on it. That's a shame because that was the selling point for me. I had a beautiful blue star sapphire ring growing up and fell in love with the stone. The diamonds are micro chips. I think lab created could have afforded at least a big enough sapphire to see the star.
2.0,Purchased shoes for my 16 month old grandson. Shoe is smaller than size ordered. Could not get shoes on his feet. I would recommend ordering a size up if you purchase this shoe.
2.0,"I purchased this item (Women's Spaghetti Strap Jumpsuit V Neckline Loose Harem One Piece Romper,<br />Sold by E.JAN1ST) AND a similar one (Love in Harlem Jumpsuit Sold by Fits Cloth). The one by Fits Cloth has nicer material and a better cut. Go with that one!"
2.0,"Flimsy, cheap looking. the only reason I didn't give it just one star is the design pattern on it saves it from being something out of a gumball machine."
2.0,"Jeans are decent. The coloring is messed up on the back pockets. They fit a little odd. But still wearable. The only thing that kills the jeans for me is the strong, STRONG, musty odor. Last jeans I ordered off Amazon I threw away. After leaving them outside a year and washed multiple times, never went away. I can‚Äôt return these, at this point but buyer beware of the musty odor."
2.0,Super cute but incredibly weak. Didn‚Äôt last much past 5 wears.
2.0,Clinging thin fabric that runs small. Returned.
2.0,"This dress just isn't made for women with larger chests. I sized up to be safe and was able to get in the dress, but it completely squashed my girls down. It fit fine everywhere else, but I will be returning. On the plus side, it's as cute in person as it looks online!"
2.0,"The quality of the clothes is too bad, even if it is disposable. It broke before putting it on."
2.0,"I love the modern look of these frames with my short white hair. However, they seem to have a flaw in the frame and break after only a few months in the same place on the bottom inside edge. I‚Äôve had four pairs. Same thing. For the price I don‚Äôt mind repurchasing but wish Foster Grant could fix the flaw.  Also, the glass clarity is not consistent."
2.0,Real easy to rip. The cooling feature works well though. If they were 5$ it would‚Äôve been worth it
2.0,"This runs big and the material is cheap but I will wear it for lounging. I would NOT PURCHASE THIS!! Very cheap looking, disappointed to say the least!!"
2.0,I got this dress and it ran a little big. I would say no need to buy a bigger side. The material is stretchy making a little bigger than expected.
2.0,"You get what you pay for.  These glasses were less than $10, including shipping.  I only ordered them so that I could test if I liked bi-focal glasses for driving my car.  I didn't, so this $10 saved me from spending several hundreds on prescription bi-focal driving glasses."
2.0,"It is really cute and I love the message.  But its one of those women's shirts that looks like it was made for a barbie doll.  Really close cut and paper thin.  It isn't too small exactly, just more clingy than I'd prefer."
2.0,"I can't say I really like this nightgown/dress. The fabric, which is ostensibly silk (so why call it a ""satin"" nightgown?) is almost literally paper-thin, and although it is smooth it is not soft in the sense of flowing over my body, instead it just hang there. And even the black color I ordered is somewhat transparent. It also runs large. I never have a problem ordering Medium, but this nightgown is immense on me. And it doesn't look pretty; it's more like a ""satin"" hospital gown. I can't imagine wearing this as a dress, but if I did want it to be a dress, I would definitely need a slip. It looks very bright and shiny in the product pics, but there's no glamorous sheen to it that I can detect. Disappointing."
2.0,Very small ordered at least 2 sizes larger requires battery pack
2.0,Disappointed in the quality.  Boots came with tons of long threads inside and outside of the boots. I was also disappointed these shipped from China. I was not aware until the item shipped. It took about a month to arrive.  They're cute and look as pictured but I'm disappointed in the lack of quality.
2.0,"I bought this as a loose tunic to wear with leggings, and thought I was being smart by buying one 2 sizes larger than I typically wear.  Even so, it is too small to wear as I had hoped! I'm very disappointed..."
2.0,unless you‚Äôd like it to be see through and wear something underneath; this shirt is for you. i‚Äôve been looking everywhere to find a non see through top and i‚Äôm kinda disappointed. as far as the quality goes it‚Äôs very soft :)
2.0,"Sadly, I didn't like these.  They weren't very attractive and I didn't think they were comfortable."
2.0,I really like the stones and color scheme but it broke and it's too hard to put back together
2.0,"Edit: I changed this review from 4 stars to 2 stars because after just a few months of wearing these only once every 2 or 3 weeks they are getting holes and the elastic is fraying and getting warped. I literally have underwear that is over 10 years old that has been worn far more often and that is in better shape. No pair of underwear should already be falling apart after being worn less than 10 times. That aside from the color issues I mentioned in the earlier version of this review. I really thought I'd found a winner here but what I found is semi-disposable underwear instead. I need to find a brand like it but that is much better quality. Suggestions welcomed.<br /><br />Prior review:<br />Overall I really like these and so I'm giving them 4 stars. You could make a case for 3 stars because they are a bit skimpy and the white band will stain and become grey after the very first time you wash them (see photo). This staining is annoying and affects 6 of the 7 pairs. That said they work for me to a large enough degree that I purchased more and just bought another similar set from this manufacturer ([[ASIN:B0185QQI10 DESMIIT Men's 7-Pack Brief Sexy Underwear US Larger / Asia Tag XL]]). I'm prone to some sensitivity and need extra support and this usually means jock straps and a bare bottom, which in turn makes me feel like I forgot to put on underwear...especially in winter. These give me the great support of a jockstrap but the feel of briefs, in coverage, comfort and affordability. The result over the past few months has been much improved personal comfort. They also look reasonably good for when my girlfriend sees them, which matters too of course. So far I'd say they are currently my favorite kind of underwear and I only wish the color's held together better."
2.0,"I hate leaving negative reviews, but seriously, I could have made one of these and it would fit.  The only one I like is the blue one, but those elastic things on the sides--they look lower than what they are.  These come up under your arm pits. The white one and the black one are wrinkled and the collars are way too stiff.  I don't recommend these.  Find an old shirt that you don't wear anymore and cut if off at the bottom.  That's what I should have done.  These are NOT worth what they are asking."
2.0,The shorts are SHOOOORT.
2.0,These are better classed as low waist!
2.0,We received this costume one day before Halloween. My wife intended to wear it to work the next morning and then for Halloween night to give candy to the kids. She tried it on and one side of the strings along the chest strings were hanging off. I did not know if this was by design whether it was defective. I sent a note to the seller who never answered back. My wife wound up not dressing for the Halloween day both at work and during trick or a treat. We sent it back.
2.0,The instructions were very vague for setting watch up. I was disappointed as it was a gift for my 5 year old granddaughter
2.0,Not necessarily needed just wear regular  sunglasses
2.0,Too low cut and too big. Cute design but cheaply made.
2.0,"Washed it several times in warm, soapy water, yet the product had a sticky residue all over it and can‚Äôt get it off. So annoying."
2.0,They look and feel nice but the fingertips do not work on touchscreens as stated. I may have to return them after Christmas depending on what the gift recipient thinks.
2.0,"The strap didn‚Äôt fit my sons glasses. He is 8 years old. So I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt fit. Material is good. Feels good, but he can‚Äôt use them. Only reason why I have the 2 stars. Very disappointed."
2.0,I ordered this set and it did not come with gloves. I put in a return and asked for a replacement. The replacement also came with no gloves! Disappointing as the gloves would have finished off the costume
2.0,My 6 year old said it was scratchy so we returned it.
2.0,No cotton crotch in them it's all satin! Would rather have a cotton crotch area.
2.0,"Polarization is good, but they don't actually block much sunlight. I can't wear them when there is any direct sunlight."
2.0,Not 100% Leather
2.0,It's not what I expected. The material looks sheer on the photo but it really isn't. The colors are not as it seems in photo. The blue is a bit darker in real. I bought this to use as a coverup when going to the beach. Don't think I'll use it.
2.0,"Cute bag, but Cheap lining. It is darker than pictured, but description warned me of that.  Did not come with the cute bangle.  But worst problem?  I got it on Tuesday and by Friday the lining has already ripped! I could try to repair it, but I don't love it enough to put that kind of work into it. Returning."
2.0,Super cheap... it‚Äôs not even a dress .. or tunic... it‚Äôs like a long t shirt for sleeping maybe... when no one seeing you üòÅüòÅ
2.0,So I liked these glasses except for the fact they came without a case and they scratch if you look at them wrong. Cant see out of them anymore because of this. Also the arms seem very loose. They never stay shut when you put them away
2.0,Sizes too small and very flimsy material
2.0,"I received a brown backpack, not a green one. The label on the backpack even says army green, but I got a dirty brown color. Overall, the quality of the backpack is good: thick straps, nice material, holds all my stuff."
2.0,Too big and uncomfortable. I had to return them.
2.0,"These are so cute!!! That being said, it's pretty much all they are. Kiddo has had them for six weeks & not even wore them every day, but the velcro is already wore out to the point there's only a tiny bit left holding the strap down. Also the pink pieces on the toes and heels is peeling off now as well. Cute, but very cheaply made. I would not buy again."
2.0,The material is cheap and the pants were a little large in the waist. Will be returning.
2.0,"It was baggy everywhere, not flattering at all. Sent it back"
2.0,Criss-cross is just awkward. Returning
2.0,Was disappointed. It is not well made and the zipper broke on the first day.
2.0,It work for few months and it stop but for the price ( it was cheap like 5$)
2.0,"I am 5'10 and weigh about 135.  Since other raters said these ran small I ordered a medium to make sure they fit.  The size chart also said they were 37&#34; long.  I thought that was the inseam which would be great as I am long in the legs as well as the torso.  The fit is very tight; a large would probably fit more comfortably. And it turns out they were 37&#34; from the waist to bottom of the cuff; the inseam is actually 26&#34;, way too short for me.  So I now have a cute pair of short tight sleep pants, if I don't eat too much during the day.  Can anyone recommend a pair of pants like these, with side pockets and ankle cuffs, that would fit a tall person?"
2.0,Product is super thin. Not squat proof. Very soft and nice color but way too thin.
2.0,"Smaller than expected, cute but material is thin. I ordered XL and I am a 38 bust, 43 hip the front showed too much boobs even laced up tight."
2.0,i got a small and the size just didn't fit
2.0,I ordered a large. I'm 5ft 9in and 150 lbs. It was huge and skoppy.
2.0,These are way bigger than I expected. They were too heavy and gaudy so I returned them.
2.0,This product is too small and thin.  Can roll it into one hand.
2.0,"I don't like the material they're made of- it's too hot for me. Plus, they're not flattering at all."
2.0,Fragile sunglasses
2.0,"While the goggles I received were decent and comfortable, they did not have the nose cover.  They are just regular goggles.  Very disappointed. Never heard from seller on these either"
2.0,The package came promptly. The colors are great. The material is THIN. I put my hand in the leg of the pants and I could see my entire hand clearly. I completed a return with no incident due to the quality of the product being lacking.
2.0,I was hoping these necklaces wouldn't tangle. Lord what a mess. I wore the necklace once and had to take it off several times to untangle it. Made me nuts.
2.0,Everything was great about it. The only big disappointment was that the sewing on the back hill on both slippers was coming off the minute my child wore the slippers for the first time.
2.0,Not up to Amazon quality; was way to small.  I take a L and it was like a Small.  I will not take a chance on trying this another one.
2.0,I hate how the padding in the bras never stay in place.
2.0,To big for small wrists
2.0,Actual item looks different from the picture
2.0,"Nice top, but I ordered a 1X and received an XL instead.  Believe me, there is a difference!  I had to return this one!"
2.0,Fabric not as soft as expected. Returning.
2.0,"Shirt is cute but I usually find M to sometimes be too large but this M was very very tight.  If you don't want a skin tight fit, size up.  Had to return"
2.0,The shoe is way to small. But is beautiful don‚Äôt know if I should go up just half a size or and full and half size. Wish they had a sizing chart they actually follow and not just Amazons standard sizing
2.0,I was severely disappointed in this mask. It is very bulky in the middle to the point where it was covering my eyes. If you have a bigger face maybe it would fit but sized more for a man. Can't return so I'll keep it as an emergency one but very upset I can't use it for work.
2.0,It‚Äôs very cheap fabric and many edges are unfinished. Just a cut edge.
2.0,Mush timber then expected. Also arrived completely tarnished.
2.0,They are ok- a bit small and the button falls off easily.
2.0,Looks very cheap. Took almost a month to get to me also because it comes from China.
2.0,"When my friend told me we were going for a walk, I didn‚Äôt know she meant on a dirt road.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this cleaner didn‚Äôt make my shoes look much better. Got the surface dirt off but did nothing for the stains. (See before and after pics.) Pretty sad."
2.0,The first time i accidentally got it wet it fell apart
2.0,They are clear.  But allot thinner then original lens.  They fit okay.
2.0,"Yes I know wearing heels isn't supposed to be comfortable. But other than the soft material on the inside there is absolutely no support. It feels as if you are walking directly on the ground. And the height is very awkward for the shoe, it would be so much nicer if it came up maybe a half inch or an inch"
2.0,"The height (bottom of mask to top of mask) is a bit small. It fits over the nose and chin but only barely. They kind of skimped on material. My other masks have more depth (top to bottom of mask).  It's about an 1/2 to 3/4""  shorter than the other two masks I've got. It's to a point that if you have it over you chin the top part of the mask is on the tip of your nose that's not supported by bone. Makes it pretty uncomfortable. It should be fine for smaller face, say a woman's face but not sure if the mustache is something they'd be excited about. :-)"
2.0,"These use to cost $0.79, same material, rips easily at seems not intended for people with 22inch pythons and definitely not worth the price of 20 for 10 but o guess the color patterns alright and if you do have average arms they'll fit"
2.0,"If your son has fat feet these are not the shoes for him. Also, they run small."
2.0,No way no good
2.0,"disappointed with it...not enough compartments for my cards, but I guess I can give it as a Christmas present."
2.0,Product was too small and very thin.
2.0,These sandals are very pretty.  My feet kept turning sideways & I couldn't keep them on.  I returned them.
2.0,It‚Äôs shorter than pictured.  Not exactly what I wanted. I bought it because it was supposed to be knee or below the knee length. That was not accurate
2.0,It looks amazing but once I tried it looked so cheap the back is nothing like the picture
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt look at all the picture that I order
2.0,"Not the greatest quality (kind of thin), but hey, they're only $10.<br />Oh, and, I ordered the &#34;dark&#34; purple, and they are very much lavender. Not cool."
2.0,"These look nice in pic , but doesn't state that they are oxidized silver. I received these with a bent post stem. Nice size , doesn't overwhelm the ear."
2.0,The skirt is beautiful but was a lot smaller than I expected.
2.0,"I got the shirts in 2XL because that's what I am wearing, but when we received them, the size read XXL but they were 2 sizes too small."
2.0,This is a nice looking bag but the craftsmanship is bad . The zippers broke before I used the bag so it was returned .
2.0,"I like the look and feel of this watch, however the time is never correct. I‚Äôm constantly resetting the time. I just looked at it while writing this (decided to review after once again finding myself resetting it) and found the second hand completely stopped. Tapped the side and it started moving again. I‚Äôm guessing this is how it gets behind. Fortunately for me, I bought this more for fashion because I like the way a large face watch looks. But I still find myself checking the time on my phone out of pure habit so the incorrect time doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. Just a minor annoyance. But if you rely on a watch for time, look elsewhere."
2.0,"Im 6,3 200pd long torso and this tank was just about showing belly, i order a 2x could not believe  it was that small.material felt good tho.sending back.i like my shirts 2or3 inches below  belt line."
2.0,"Pros: They are pretty and cheap.<br /><br />Cons: IMPOSSIBLE BACKINGS! I mean, impossible! I can't get many of them off so they are just laying with the rest of my jewelry and taking up space. They are almost fused to the actual earring so removing them, thus using them, is very difficult and not worth the cheap price."
2.0,"We have an Amazon essentials size 8 shoe for my 3 year old which we were trying to replace because it was now too small, we ordered a size 10 deer stags and it is exactly the same size as an 8 for Amazon. How is anyone supposed to know what size to get from any brand anymore when there is no consistency. Photos attached: Amazon essentials on the left and deer stags on the right. I have a hard time believing my normal size 3 year old needs a size 12‚Ä¶"
2.0,Very thick. They stick just fine but I can't get the air bubbles out. Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,"Clasp cheap, broken, had to get it repaired, but love the charms and designs.have cotton a lot of compliments  about the coolers ."
2.0,One of the bras did not have the connector to start bra together. So only can wear 5 bras
2.0,"What I disliked about the necklace was it size and the quality of the metal that was used for the necklace.  Also, the stone could have been much bigger. It did not cost a lot to purchase, but when you factor in shipping and handling, I think it‚Äôs overpriced, and I‚Äôm a little disappointed."
2.0,Cute print but runs very small. I recommend going up 2 sizes.
2.0,It's more of a clingy chep material. Almost spandex fit with very sheer type cap attatched. Qyality is kinda cheep looking.
2.0,"I am 5'9"" and weigh 155 lbs and the medium is the right length, but they are a little too tight. I wouldn't have wanted a large as it would have been too long.  Disappointed the sweatpants are not comfortable for me."
2.0,Originally I was extremely happy with this purchase however less than a year later one side is no longer working correctly.  Even without constant use the right side now loudly grinds when it actually turns which is sporadic.  Very disappointed. For the price it should have lasted longer.
2.0,"I like that the lenses arent so dark. I have a astigmatism, and dark glasses dont work for me. They are comfortable to wear and light. However, the glasses themselves are about the quality of something you'd find at the dollar store. Lots of money in packaging that they should have actually put into the product."
2.0,"Bracelet was EXTREMELY large, required bending to be able to even stay on my wrist! Also was much rougher and cheaper appearing than in the photos. I purchased a name-brand version of this bracelet that came in a 3-pack of plastic versions and, despite being made of PLASTIC, those look like they are much higher quality than this bracelet. Would not purchase again. Also, the opening to hold a hair tie in this bracelet is larger than I would have liked, there is plenty of room for the hair tie to move around and it does not fit snuggly."
2.0,These fell apart after only 4 months.
2.0,I loved this piercing! It was great UNTIL... it fell apart 2 days into wearing it. One of the dangles went missing and the piercing unscrewed itself and dropped right out of my naval. I tightened it hard too.  I just want another one but I don't want to spend money on it if it's only going to last 2 days...):
2.0,It's alittle small for me
2.0,Did not come with side pocket as advertised. They need to separate the listing for pockets and no pockets.
2.0,"Likes: Shipping was amazing fast for shipping to overseas. Pants and belt fit is perfect.<br /><br />Dislikes: Shirt and vest way too small.<br /><br />I ordered a L and even used the measurements from the size charts provided, and the shirt and vest are way too small."
2.0,"Too low cut, slips off heel every time.  Fit seems right yet it doesn‚Äôt stay in place.  I‚Äôve got plenty of other ‚Äúno show, low cut‚Äú socks that stay on better than these."
2.0,I ordered this ring for my sister.  I am really disappointed in it as the stone has no veins and doesn't look real.<br />It's too late to send it back as Christmas is in two days.  I don't recommend this ring.
2.0,I returned these.  They were way too big for my  liking and looked rather cheap made.
2.0,it‚Äôs a quite tight headband.
2.0,They fit as expected but doesn't lift the butt at all.
2.0,"Fabric does not give- I'm 5'5&#34;,165-very curvy in the hip area.  Ordered a large but will probably not wear it- too tight for my taste.-I can get in it, but it is Marilyn-tight.  If you don't carry your curves on your bottom half you would probably be ok. Would order an XL but feel like everything else would be disproportionate due to my height."
2.0,"This dress was awful, the slit was not on the side and was in the front, which showed my whole cha cha when i tried it on. The materiel is very cheap feeling and very shiny. Overall this dress did not work for me and i sent it back. If you have bigger hips and or butt, this dress is not for you."
2.0,Only one glove works.
2.0,Not perfect fit.
2.0,"This dress was not what I was expecting. The front part of the dress was very sheer. The lace was not the quality I was expecting. I returned it. And yes, I did read the reviews, and search through the pictures."
2.0,"very fragile, I am terrified will break when to put them on"
2.0,They are unforgiving in the crotch area. I was singing soprano.  No give with movement. Do not recomend. Bought an XL and they fit but were snug. No room for the boys to breathe.
2.0,"The idea behind this is wonderful, the execution however, was horrific, weird material that allows no breathability or room to wear underwear or a bra underneath without everyone knowing what you've got on."
2.0,Not a good fit for me. This item was returned
2.0,Size does not match the size chart.
2.0,Doesn't look this good.  Colors are off & not so good
2.0,Has broken 6 or 7 times.  Have to fix it every time I wear it.
2.0,I went by their measurement thingy and ended up with a jacket that swallows me.<br />I‚Äôm gonna have to get it Tailored.<br />Just be weary of the size charts
2.0,"Love the way these look however, they are not sterling silver and turn within one week. My ears are very infected from them. I recommend wearing them for a few hours and not sleeping in them."
2.0,"Too small for my ears, and I don‚Äôt have large ones."
2.0,"All in all it‚Äôs ok for use of first birthday where you‚Äôre probably going to throw it out after. The top fitted great and looked cute. The tutu fit ok, I just wish there was more material, you have to have pants on with it or you‚Äôll see their diaper."
2.0,"I wear a medium, and these are listed true to size. They are not. They look much nicer on the model. The pockets are not very big either. If you can get your cellphone in one, it will fall out. My phone is about the same size (width and height) of my hand. My hand will not comfortably and completely fit in a pocket. Pity. Back to the drawing board."
2.0,The pocket that holds the battery pack started falling apart immediately. Bought this for my son's school Christmas spirit week. Upon opening the pocket for the first time the seams started unraveling. At some point at school the pocket became so unraveled that the battery pack was hanging out and he could no longer use it.
2.0,Don't really like the way the turtle nick is made.
2.0,"Tarnishes, does not stay pink/rose. Very disappointed."
2.0,It‚Äôs ok but Velcro doesn‚Äôt stick very well
2.0,I liked it but unfortunately I couldn't zip it up all the way due to my breasts filling it up and not having enough space to completely zip it. I am looking to return it soon. I wish it did fit because it is beautiful!
2.0,I do love this shirt. However the seams at<br />The last two buttons started coming undone the very first wear. The fabric is difficult to seam up. I shouldn't of had to think of such an issue the first wear :/
2.0,"The face is quite small, so hard to read the time.  Not appropriate for someone with dementia."
2.0,Fits as expected I just didn't like it and they way the front ripples in the pic is false there is no ripple hang down in real life just tringle tip fabric
2.0,Looks better in the pictures. Poor quality stones.
2.0,material is polyester...not the best for summer...colors are very vibrant and pretty but  unless you have nice body and don't mind your dress clinging to you this is not the dress for you
2.0,Sure it looks cute...if you can get it on! The curve of the ring is too tight and I can't get it to fit on/in my nose. And it's near impossible to bend to make the curve wider.
2.0,Purse will not hold up well. Looks nice but you can tell its cheaply made. You get what you pay for though.
2.0,Items are as described but looks very cheap. Will not be wearing
2.0,"Beads fell off the first day. I've learned my lesson, quality costs more."
2.0,"This costume is absolutely adorable, but SO small. Bought the size small for my 20 year old who always wears a small, 5‚Äô5 and 120 pounds. The elastic around the arms was strangling her tiny little twig arms‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt imagine who has smaller arms than her who this could possibly fit! Also, the entire thing was just super short. Not like I‚Äôm just old and think skirts should be long, I mean like not long enough to cover my 5‚Äô5‚Äô‚Äô kid‚Äôs bum even if she is just standing still. We bought a black petticoat for her to wear underneath and give an extra 2 inches in length. It was super cute with the extra black ruffle hanging down, but I would have preferred for the dress to actually fit without buying an extra piece. Also, it‚Äôs not just the skirt that is too short, the waist is really high, like the entire dress is made for a kid and not an adult. The entire thing just looked way too small. It‚Äôs super cute, but order at least two sizes up. Also, don‚Äôt go by the size chart included in the post, according to those measurements my kid should have needed an XS, so I thought ordering the small was sizing up, but apparently she needed at least a medium, possibly a large."
2.0,Bought for my son.  He‚Äôs two and they‚Äôll fit him in about 5 years!
2.0,It's about 10 times smaller than the photo.  Its tiny!  Like thread.  I am keeping it because my 16 year old daughter picked it out.
2.0,"The rings are pretty. However, the thin one broke in half as soon as i put it on due to me adjusting it to fit my finger."
2.0,Smaller than expected and very thin material.
2.0,Not the best quality. I can't breathe without sucking in the interior liner. It is horribly made.
2.0,"It fits well, it's very thin, so only good for wearing under a dress or skirt.  The material shows pink base color instead of white.  Good value but low quality."
2.0,Not a nice fabric. Cheaper fabric than anticipated.
2.0,Very cute jeans!!! I wore these almost everyday for a few weeks and then one day is squatted down and they ripped. These weren‚Äôt tight on me they just weren‚Äôt very durable.
2.0,Too small for me. So sad.
2.0,"I bought these socks in anticipation of my eight month old becoming more mobile.  We have another pack of 0-24 month socks that I love so I figured going that route would be a good investment, especially after seeing how she's already outgrown so many other pairs.  The thing is, these socks are not sized for a baby.  These are sized for a child, maybe a 2-4 year old.  The only pro is that they're really soft, and very cute.  Some of the animals have features that stand out with their own fabric, which is adorable.  That said, this is not what I was lead to believe I was purchasing."
2.0,"Didnt expect 3 BLACK, 1 Fluorescent Yellow, 1 White.....  I thought it was 5 different colors by picture. ??? If I had known this, I wouldnt have bought these for school."
2.0,"My likes are, material fill good and look good!<br />My dislikes are, do not fit to size, my size is XL, but by the cut depends on how you would like it to fit, large to med may work."
2.0,Love the shirt but too small..order 2 sizes up!
2.0,Cute bracelet but it's strung together by a clear plastic stretchy string similar to a rubberband. Not worth the money they charge.
2.0,Don't buy for winter
2.0,I will have to give this away. All the necklaces are so short They barely go around my neck. I get claustrophobic. I did not realize that for women the necklaces were so small. I will continue my search but I am defiantly not going to buy anymore pendants to go on a necklace chain since I can not find an appropriate chain.
2.0,"UPDATE: I went to put on the second bra and I realize it came with one of the nursing fabric insert pieces broken- not attached to the bra.<br /><br />Iordered these in an XL as pre pregnancy (bigger now!) I was a 34DD. I ordered a kindred bravely one in a large, and it fits but is pretty snug with side boob that comes out. These fit better coverage wise with the width for me in the XL, but doesn‚Äôt have great/ strong support. The padding that is used fits a little weird in the bra so when I wear it alone around the house the bra does look a little weird, but it‚Äôs not terrible under clothes. They do fit a little cheap-ly but then again they aren‚Äôt expensive nursing bras."
2.0,This sweatshirt is clunky for lack of a better description.  The pockets are weird and chunky. Also the pockets were sewn closed.  I had to take a pair of scissors to open them up.
2.0,"I had very high hopes for this ring but the craftsmanship on the ring was sloppy. The stain work wasn't crisp in the lines of where it should have been, some thing which shouldn't have stain did - when you looked closely, it was just production made w/out concern for excellence - that's not the Mason way."
2.0,"Way way way, too big. I have small hands, but I also had my mom and a few friends try it on too and it was way to big for them as well, a real shame since this was for a prom look."
2.0,This pink lady jacket is very cheap. The sleeve is coming undone. The jacket itself has runs on it. Haven't worn it yet but too late to return it because I won't get another in time for Halloween. Very dissatisfied.
2.0,"Although it was very cute and I loved the bow, it was poorly made.  String of material hanging everywhere"
2.0,"Just didn't fit right for me. Liked the pattern but not the way the top, off the shoulder, fit.  Returned."
2.0,"It was a cute suit by the looks of it, but it was SO SMALL! I ordered a size up from what I normally wear it the bikini looked like it would fit a 10 year old. I plan on giving it to my niece since it is pretty much her size. I would order 3 sizes larger than what you normally wear. The suit looks promising, but I couldn't try it on because the waist band would hardly fit over my thigh. I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review."
2.0,LOOKS CHEAP! I should have looked closer at the waffle material of the shirt but the colors are not as vibrant as the picture. The yellow and the pink looks slightly dingy. I will be returning this one.
2.0,The leather was really dry and cracking when I received it. Too uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,Cute color but it looks like pajamas. I returned it. It is true to size.
2.0,"The dress didn't come close to fitting, I gave it to my 8yr old skinny granddaughter after I had to manually cut open all of the button holes. Other than not fitting a normal adult, and having to finish the dress, what can I say but it looks great on her. I ordered a size M. I see that now they have a size disclaimer but didn't when I bought it back in October of '17. I see now according to Chinese size I'm an extra large (<br />not a current selection) with a 30&#34; waist? Those poor malnourished Chinese people...when extra large is 30&#34;... I wish it came in my size though it is nicely cut."
2.0,Flimsy and does not stay over your mouth while talking.
2.0,Could only get one leg in. As if there made for children
2.0,The breather caps dont stay closed.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:bdb93378985a33264caa3a9156275d56]] I thought the misspelling in the photo was for marketing reasons until I got the shirt in. Most of it is misspelled. It‚Äôs a nice comfy shirt but almost every song name is misspelled. Fix this!!!
2.0,"Poorly made. Super poorly made. Came with a rip in the dress, I returned immediately."
2.0,"Cute boots but, feel apart after just 4 months :("
2.0,After the first washing it started falling apart at the seams
2.0,Gave this 2 stars because zipper broke. This bad only lasted for 5 days on a cruise.
2.0,"Two stars because it was packaged very well and came with a cleaning cloth and sleeve.<br />They broke in half within 2 weeks after I had them on my shirt and gave someone a hug. I honestly cant think of much that would break that easily. -an egg, a lightbulb, and skadino glasses."
2.0,it broke before i could even wear it.. not made very well
2.0,Not at all like we expected
2.0,They hurt my nose can't wear them too long.
2.0,"I'm being generous by giving the product 2 stars for cute pattern, color and design. But all of this is no use if the sizing is waaay off! I'm usually a medium, slim in the hips and thighs and wear a size 6-8 in pants. These would barely fit over my hips! Too tight in the waist and everywhere else! And I got a size Large, too. Bummer because I dd like the print. I ended up returning them. So be aware that unless you are very petite, these are bound to be too small. If they do fit you, then you'll probably like them. Good Luck!"
2.0,I ordered my usual size which is a medium and these were way too small. I couldn‚Äôt even get them up past my knees.
2.0,"The picture looks better then the actual sweater. The sweater looks cheap,and is very thin,but my son liked it."
2.0,"I've only worn Reef sandals for the last ten years, and the quality has really diminished. These sandals were in the sun for like an hour while I was in the pool and the leather shrank and came off."
2.0,This looked more like a nightgown then a dress I got the largest size available and couldn't even get it on.
2.0,Cheap fabric too shiny
2.0,The material wasn‚Äôt to my liking. It was almost rough. I recommend that you get a size bigger if you buy this.
2.0,"Not what I expected, don‚Äôt like color and they were really loose.<br />Sorry!"
2.0,i returned this for a different coat because it didn't look warm enough for where I live in the winter season it was a nice coat though
2.0,"It's cute,  but unless your boobs come out of your chin, the dots won't cover you."
2.0,"okay enough, but the thread that wraps around the band to hold the two straps that go between your two toes unravelled on 2nd wear.  not a big deal, but it's not the same profile as the other shoe now.  not the greatest all the other reviews say they are...but they are well padded shoes...."
2.0,"Disappointed that the Cashmere is &#34;Made in China&#34; and has a bit of a chemical odor to it.  The other disappoint was the gift box, which looked like it had been kicked around in a locker room - black smudges and red stains all over the white lid.  Too much money for little quality."
2.0,"Looks like the picture except on it‚Äôs super long and wide. I‚Äôm normally a large, I could‚Äôve gotten this in a small so it could fit like the girl in the picture"
2.0,"I am 5'7"" 200 pounds and i ordered a large.  While it does fit, it just looks very strange and boxy. Will be returning"
2.0,Returnedtwice for smaller size and still huge. Really thin material so it‚Äôs not great for colder climates
2.0,"The sleeves made me feel like a line backer. I have large arms. The sleeves are not generous nor do they attach where you'd think they should. It all looks wrong on me.  Other than the sleeves I loved it. The waist was perfect sized the length everything was wonderful. But I don't really wanna look like a line backer well maybe if I run into some hooligans I can intimidate them, but yeah I rather look pretty... so there's that"
2.0,It's so cold in New York these days. Sub-zero temperatures. I took the glove out for my sister to use. Put it over your hand. It's not as warm as you think. That doesn't matter. Use for a few days. It's only been three days. Who knows. My sister told me. It broke today. The left index finger. Well. Really. Hope manufacturers continue to work hard. Make a good product
2.0,Exchanged them for a smaller pair.
2.0,"Well made and good color, but way too small."
2.0,"It fit well, but I would've liked it little more loose. I'm 5'9 165 and got a medium."
2.0,Very cheap unpleasant fabric. Ran very small too
2.0,"For reference: I am 5‚Äô1, 140 Lb, 32H bust, short torso and typically wear a medium.<br />It‚Äôs a nice thin material. Perfect for spring. I loved the idea of adjustable tie straps. Buuuut the only way for the chest to fit me and cover my bra was to tie it as tight as possible. The smocked back was nice, covered my bra. Overall the dress visually added about 45 pounds to me in my hips and waist."
2.0,"These earrings are very cute, but only would work with thin ear lobes."
2.0,way to narrow and long for my foot.
2.0,Cute dress but ended up returning from being so itchy! The dress is cheaply made and sequin stitching irritated my skin.
2.0,Not impressed low quality
2.0,The flowers were smooshed and I can't seem to get them to fluff back up. The package I received them in had plenty of room and didn't explain the flat look to them. Also the band is bigger and rough making these more for a toddler up in my opinion but that's not a big concern of mine.
2.0,"Not true to size. Should have ordered a size bigger. Very tight and left nothing to the imagination. Good design but too small for a US large. They look good as pictured which is why I give 2 stars, but the fit is way off."
2.0,"Lightweight ~ Nice Shade of Dark Forest Green ~ Soft<br />If you're looking for a SUPER relaxed oversized fit (similar to a sweatshirt), you might like this one.<br />The bottom hem is semi-swooped up at the sides.  Meaning, it is not cut straight across.<br /><br />I did buy a larger size as I was hoping for a relaxed oversized comfortable sweater.<br />However, I was also hoping for a bit of flare from the bust down.<br />Nope--it drops straight down only the weave/fabric is very lightweight so there's also no heft to how it hangs.<br /><br />It was comfortable across the chest and sleeves, but if you pooch out at the belly and the butt...and hope to camo that a bit; this sweater doesn't accomplish that look and feel.<br /><br />The neckline close-up photo shows how thin and (what I'd consider) delicate finish work.<br />The neckline is quite wide and can give you that ""Flashdance"" kind of effect at the shoulders.<br />The weave and feel is very lightweight ~ This isn't a sweater for warmth.<br /><br />All in all, I think that the current selling price is too much for this sweater unless you just really love this style design."
2.0,"I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with this ring , the ‚Äú gold‚Äù looked weird , I ordered a size 6 and it fit like a 7 . The painted details were clumsy . I doubt if I‚Äôll ever wear it ."
2.0,"VERY stiff shoes. My daughter is normally excited to perform, but she wouldn't even finish her class because these hurt too much. Hoping to find a way to expedite the wear at the top of the ankle."
2.0,did not like the way  it fit.
2.0,The size was off. I could not wear them at all.
2.0,Cheap but made a good enough gift.
2.0,It‚Äôs made for someone taller. The waist hugs at the wrong part.
2.0,I actually liked it when I opened it... but in a matter of 2hrs it broke!! One of the charms flew off the bracket... so if u don‚Äôt mind paying for something that breaks immediately<br />... buy it... but u have been warned...
2.0,Not as expected. I had previously purchased the same product from the same supplier and with a much thinner thread. I reordered what I thought would be the same one but the new one came with a much thicker thread and looks a little more &#34;Happy Minyan&#34; style than I personally prefer.
2.0,Holes are where color difference is...<br />Not allowed in most schools... wish i would of known
2.0,"The fabric is very thin, looks cheap. The fit is very tight and runs small, though the material is very stretchy. The sleeves are very weird. It almost feels like the thumb hole is on the outer side. Sending it back, though the color is beautiful."
2.0,Returned. The front slit was way too short for me but a large would have been too big everywhere else. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and purchased a medium. I really liked the color though!
2.0,Wayyy too small. I ordered a large (I'm a size 12) and it didn't go over my shoulders. Def buy larger then you normally would.
2.0,My daughter loves this but I think it is cheaply made.
2.0,The size was not accurate to my typical size. It seemed like it was a child‚Äôs outfit.
2.0,"This set is nothing special, that‚Äôs for sure. I was disappointed to see how thin the fabric is, and the color just looked like the outfit was dirty instead of actually being tie-dyed. It did fit true to size, so I guess it‚Äôs a good fall pajama outfit, but nothing cute to see here. I‚Äôd rather have kept browsing and spent my money on something a little better quality."
2.0,"These pants are nice at a glance and they‚Äôre comfortable, I ordered a 12 and that was a bit big but the pants come with a belt. The unfortunate thing about these pants is that the material rips very easily. If pants are loose and big they shouldn‚Äôt just tear and rip easily."
2.0,The little pieces that you connect the charm to doesn‚Äôt close all the way.
2.0,"Unfortunately, this dress was terrible. The first problem was that the holes for the buttons weren't big enough for the actual buttons. The material of this dress was so incredibly cheap looking. It basically looks like a shiny cheap robe."
2.0,"I was excited to get this pj set, but somewhat disappointed after receiving it. The pink fabric is thin and the elastic in the shorts rolls/twists (not comfortable). Overall, I wear the top more than the shorts. I wish they would have seen the elastic down in the shorts to prevent the rolling."
2.0,Beautiful fabric but waist line is made for a women it fit everywhere but you can see the way it lays on body or table the way it curves into an extremely thin waist.  So disappointed. Not worth the wait. Gonna gives this to my 14 year old niece at least she can wear it.  I so wanted this for me because of the beautiful fabric.  Sad
2.0,"I received these as a baby shower gift, but I had registered for them after reading the reviews. I use them but am disappointed by them. For starters, they are very small--about the size of a paper towel. This makes them okay for wiping and cleaning messes but ineffective as a burp cloth. When I burp baby, she occasionally spits up: I want something that I can easily throw over my shoulder and that will provide adequate coverage. With these, I cannot just throw them over; they are too small, and I find myself constantly tugging them into place. They get the job done, more or less, but I would not buy them again and would not recommend them They are soft and well-made, as other reviewers have pointed out, but they are just not effective burp clothes. The Aden & Anais burpy bib blows these out of the water!"
2.0,Pretty but arrived broken
2.0,This is for a baby neck. There is only one ring the lobster clasp can fit on.
2.0,I can not really say how well this will wear or last as it was very small.  I ordered a size up and still had issues with sizing.
2.0,"Muy bonitas,espero que sean de un material, duradero,"
2.0,The material is soft but its cheap. The cut is off and its way too small for me when I usually order a small. Go up a size if you want to order it.
2.0,"This is a wallet I want to like but I actually hate.  This wallet looks amazing, the leather is very nice and it is well laid out.  The problem I have is that it bend all of my cards.  I used this wallet for a day and it literally bent the hell out of all my credit cards.  I thought that maybe I just had too much stuff in my wallet, so I took the majority of it out and went minimalist style.  Even with only one card in each slot, my cards all get terribly bent if I keep my wallet in my back pocket.  It looks great but it destroys your plastic.  I want to like this and it looks and feels great, but it just isn't worth it.  It literally destroyed several of my cards so after a couple of weeks of using it, I am switching back to my crappy old wallet.  I am very disappointed."
2.0,"Got these in medium for my GF who normally wears a small or medium. The shorts were pretty tight but the top was laughably small, too the point that she couldn‚Äôt even get it over her head. I would recommend upsizing at LEAST 2 sizes."
2.0,This top ran about 2 sizes small.
2.0,The size is way off. I did like the material and if it fit it would be nice
2.0,My chest hands out the sides but off the fabric was thicker I could probably keep my chest in. I have a boob job so they don't move as much as real boobs but i think they would always be showing if I had real ones.
2.0,The finger lining seemed lose making it difficult to put hands back into the gloves. If your hands perspire at all the glove‚Äôs finger lining pull out when you remove the gloves. This makes it a challenge to get your hands back into the gloves. Also seemed a bit small for a large. Did not test the ‚ÄúWaterproof‚Äù characteristics. Had ro return these...
2.0,"This bag is basically a wallet. The proportions (despite measurements) on the image with the model are pretty different. The wallet is indeed very shallow and flimsy. Nice leather, but not worth price tag. Will be returning."
2.0,So cute but the ear felt off on Xmas day with the first wear
2.0,"The jacket itself is nice, but I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that the buttons popped off within 2 days of wearing it. I don't have a sewing kit, and now I need to replace the buttons since they are lost. Very disappointing product, in the end.<br /><br />Granted, the jacket is warm, but with the missing buttons, it doesn't stay on well enough to keep me warm now."
2.0,A little disappointed with this purchase- sizing runs a little small and the material is a little shearer than I was hoping for. Still not sure if I should have kept it.
2.0,"This product is poorly made, the seams are not aligned. The top fits correct, but bottoms run small."
2.0,Paint job not very good and it had cracks throughout but served its purpose from a distance.
2.0,It looks better on Amazon than in person. The belt isn‚Äôt attached to the dress or is there a thread loop for it on the dress. It‚Äôs also not flattering on bigger chested females.
2.0,"I have worn Miracle suits in a size 14 of years.  They are fantastic because I can gain or lose 10 Lbs and the size 14 always fits.  However, this particular suit had reviews stating that it was MUCH too small.  Don't believe them!  I ordered a 16 based upon the reviews, and I am sorry I did.  This thing is HUGE!  Stick with your regular Miraclesuit size.  It is a beautiful purple, much richer in color and a deeper hue than the photo, so it is a slimming color without having to be black.  The seller is refunding my money and providing a free return USPS label.  Unfortunately, I have to drive on the snow and ice for 7 miles to get to the post office.  I highly recommend the seller, but not the reviews previously stated."
2.0,"The M size is a bit large, thin and final product looks unfinished, extra threads showing. Overall, photos from site is a bit deceiving."
2.0,I ordered a 4/6 the bottom fits Amazing. However my bust is falling out of the sides. If I were to order one size larger would the top fit better?
2.0,"Pretty bummed it's not puffy at all, the pic makes it look like it's a thicker cotton, but it actually just hangs straight....its not ugly but it does look like the picture at all bummed."
2.0,Not made to last
2.0,I think it is a solid daily replacement but it literally just fell apart .  it must have lost a pin or something but very disappointed that only lasted a couple of weeks...
2.0,Cheap from China and its half clip and it has a stud on the bottom for a piercing
2.0,I thought the picture could've been larger very small for the size of the dog tag
2.0,not really what I was suspecting the size was too big and the shoes was kind of damage
2.0,"I dont really have a problem with the product (because it's so cheap) but this listing is false & inaccurate. This is not LEATHER as they state it is. In fact it's just foam with a lining of PU. It's not even full PU, just the front. Cheap, and will probably fall apart in a week or two. I would not have bought this AT ALL had I known it wasnt actually leather."
2.0,Pin fell out and was lost forever and now it's completely ruined after 6 months of daily use
2.0,The metal was not pleasant on the face. The strap was too tight.
2.0,"Being short I knew that it would be long from the start, but it was about a foot and a half too long! The material was slinky and nice but showed every little bump and dimple."
2.0,"Not the best strap adapter option.  I bought for a 44mm aluminum Apple Watch, knowing that the finish wouldn‚Äôt match due to the adapter being stainless steel.  However, the fit itself wasn‚Äôt great, with the angles on the adapter not matching the angles of the watch.  Ultimately I returned for this reason and bought a Newon adapter instead (fit much better)."
2.0,"They are not fog free ... if I pinch my mask VERY often they can be, but they are cute and I always get compliments on them."
2.0,"I have possibly been spoiled by other Amazon purchases which seem to arrive almost as soon as I get submit the order. This took over 3 weeks to arrive and when it did it was broken. I can make it work, but this is not a product I would rate highly."
2.0,does not stay on webbing strap
2.0,They were very flimsy and the clip broke the second time I tried to wear them
2.0,This belt runs very small for a stetch belt.  Also has a very strange odor to the material.  Cute belt but would have returned but it is not returnable so I am stuck with it.
2.0,Cheap material. Not what you would expect of a sweatshirt.  I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Seems reasonable for a cheap and packable jacket, but the zippers are almost useless and they are unreliable. Also of note, the zipper is left handed which is normal for USA women's clothing but not men's."
2.0,"its been more the 3 weeks  ,  i cant wait any more"
2.0,Got the ring it is beautiful but after adjusting the ring careful that it doesn't get caught on you clothes that when the ring stretch out not worth buying it i bet in another week it will breaküò°
2.0,The hat was ok as far as fit and looks. The pink baby shark was cheaply ironed on but for my 3 year old it was fine. My issue was with the adjustable strap in the back. It won‚Äôt stay connected. It‚Äôs so cheaply done that it just flaps open! Do not purchase unless you want to glue it Together! It‚Äôs a shame too because my daughter loved it! I only gave it two stars because she liked it! And that‚Äôs who it was for! We did return it because of the strap though!
2.0,"I purchased this blouse for an outfit and unfortunately this shirts XL was, by comparison to normal clothing, a small. My bra size is 36 DDD. I can confidently say if you‚Äôre anything above small you will probably not fit this shirt."
2.0,"Nope. Don‚Äôt like this set at all. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 36C, 28 waist, 35 hips. I got the size medium. I normally wear a small but I went with their size chart and other reviews. They‚Äôre way short on me, cropped length, but the ankles are too tight. Big through the hip. Really bad fit on the pants. The top is cute and fits well, only reason why I give it 2 stars. I have tattoos all over my legs and they aren‚Äôt see through, but it doesn‚Äôt matter because they‚Äôre so ill fitting I won‚Äôt ever wear them. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,"These are beautiful, I sell essential oils and I wanted to give these with lava rocks to my loyal customers. Well I can tell you a 6mm lava stone will NOT fit in this cage. I don't even think a 4mm stone would not that I can find any 4mm lava rocks. The cages come with little colored puff balls but they seem cheap so now i'm not sure what to put inside to promote my oils and give to my loyal customers. If anyone knows where i can get 4mm lavarocks or oil diffuser stones please let me know."
2.0,"These are super cute and comfy. Unfortunately one of them doesn't light up even after switching the batteries, so that's very disappointing. I'm sending them back and hoping to find some that work."
2.0,"It‚Äôs a really cute dress, I just wish it fit my body better. Had a baby 4 months ago and the material definitely doesn‚Äôt hide the baby pooch. I‚Äôm also very self conscious about my upper arms and seek out clothes that fit loosely around them like the picture shows on the model. Alas, it is very snug around the arm. The slit on the chest of the dress is also a little funky, the flaps fold out on me instead of staying put. Could make a cute maternity dress for the next baby when I want to show off a tummy bump, but for now it‚Äôll just sit in the back of my closet."
2.0,Has ruined all my clothes but I still love it
2.0,Wallet is bulky.  Too many layers of leather.
2.0,They were bent out of shaped when I received them.  Impossible to get them back like they should be.
2.0,Looks as fake as it is!
2.0,"I just thought the cut was ill-fitting.  Had to return, didn't seem contoured to a woman's body, just cut real straight."
2.0,runs small...esp sleeves.....not sure if the black blotches above Scoobys pupils are defects or what.....not licensed
2.0,"The picture is great, but unfortunately the orange in the top doesn‚Äôt match the orange in the skirt. It is a lot more florescent."
2.0,Cute but it broke the first time I wore it
2.0,I have ordered the same brand in small and medium size. The texture of the top portion of the dress is different. Just by looking at the dress. I am a little bit disappointed.
2.0,"This dress fits well and is very flattering which is why I give it two stars.  Other than that, it is disposable.  I wore this dress once for a few hours. But the time I took it off, the fabric started pilling all over the place. This is an item that can be worn once and then goes straight into the trash. Unfortunate because it really did look nice on.  I Do not recommend purchasing this dress."
2.0,very cheap quality. next time will just buy from their website.
2.0,"More protection, but only problem lose threads üßµ<br />That leads to items too poor quality"
2.0,"The color of the spandex was beautiful. I loved the thickness around the waist, but the fabric around the legs is too thin and loose. If you‚Äôre looking for spandex shorts to wear around the house, they‚Äôre perfect! However, nothing someone would want to workout in."
2.0,I did not like that the neck is unusually wide..it bares his undershirt..since I washed it before wearing I can't even return:( Material looks good for now..
2.0,"It is a cute top, but it was too small around my chest. I wear a 36DD and I got an xL"
2.0,"i like them but, unfurtunately i used them like 2 times and i noticed a screw was missing already, very poor quality"
2.0,"beads started falling off after a week of having it ): overall, it is/was very beautiful"
2.0,"Arrived with no tag, material not as expected, not true to size chart by at least one full size too small. Have to return."
2.0,It wasn't big as i expected :( but it is beautiful & small  so its ok
2.0,"The material is slightly thicker than tissue paper, but not much. The buttons are all fake, so you cannot adjust the depth of the V. You will absolutely need to wear another shirt under this, both due to the thinness of the material, and to keep your chest from spilling out the top. Why do womens clothing designers make clothes that can't even be worn on their own? What a waste. The fit of the shirt is OK for now, but given the cheap thin material‚Äã I can't see it holding shape for long. Only buy this shirt if you like dressing in layers, and even then, I'd opt for a dark color."
2.0,"These earrings are a great size and I really liked them.  However, the post broke after one wear and I had to return them."
2.0,Too small. Can not wear.
2.0,"The sizing was way, way off.  Ordered an XL and it felt more like a MED.  The shoulders were too narrow, the fronts didn't even meet. This is a stretchy garment.. I loved the deep color and style of the garment."
2.0,I need replacement parts for the bushings on poles at lower locking devise. Half of bushing fell out. Lost and pole won‚Äôt lock<br />Sounds like there are no replacement parts<br />Not good
2.0,Lost it form after the 1st use
2.0,"These are buttery soft, but run very small. I wear a 2x in all of my leggings but could not get these past by buttocks area."
2.0,"These look like comfortable pajamas and when I opened the package and felt the material they felt like comfortable pajamas - soft and cozy.  Unfortunately my perception changed after I tried these on.  The top is quite cropped which is fine if you don't care about exposing a significant portion of your midriff but a deal breaker if you do.  The pants are long enough but they are cut quite small, order at least one if not two sizes up.  The waist is not a typical drawstring but instead has an elastic waistband - one that is a bit too snug.  There is a sash secured by two belt loops that is probably more for decoration than anything else.  This sash is long enough you would probably be tangled in it when sleeping.  The soft, comfortable fabric this is made from looks and feels nice but is thin enough to be revealing.  This, coupled with the short crop top and skimpy cut combine to make these pajamas unsuitable for wearing about the house without a robe.<br /><br />It is too bad that these pajamas don't live up to the description and picture."
2.0,Blouse shrink and lost shape after 1st wash. Would have been cute if fabric was better quality
2.0,I was so small and smooth which is bot good while running
2.0,"I wasn't expecting much for $10 but this band is pretty rough. The clips to hold it into the watch don't even come installed and if you lose one, good luck finding a replacement. The magnet seems pretty strong so that's a plus.<br /><br />I think the biggest gripe about this watch, if you move your watch on your wrist at all (literally at all), expect all your arm hair to be ripped out<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this band if you're used to the quality of an apple watch band"
2.0,"The product I received was not the real Cocoon Grid-IT. Mine doesn't even have a label on it. Still works, but don't expect a name brand product."
2.0,"They're ok but suffer from the same thing as most of these, legs too short and ride up on you."
2.0,Loose. Color of navy transfers to white lava stones.
2.0,It seems cheaply made however I haven‚Äôt used it yet since I‚Äôm not traveling due to CoVid 19. Not sure this will actually work like I thought. It wasn‚Äôt what I visualized. If it does indeed work out I‚Äôll post an update.
2.0,SEE THRU!!!! Only wear with a long back top.
2.0,I ordered the size that I normally wear but these shoes run very small.  So I had to return them.  Becareful because there is a restocking fee.  I advise you to order the size larger than you think you wear.
2.0,"I got the black swirl one, really cute but the design is wearing off after just a couple of weeks. Bummed!"
2.0,Cute and compact. Opened it once but won‚Äôt click back into the locked/closed position.
2.0,Matronly in person. Runs big. I will be returning.
2.0,"the  bag looks nice but when you close it, the  flap magnates open up and the bag hang open. had to return it."
2.0,"If you think your getting a sweatshirt or sweatshirt material..your not!  That was a disappointment to me. The green is a pretty shade, but I‚Äôm not big on this material, thin and shiny!"
2.0,"In ordered the black and white pattern but got this brown pattern.  Sending it back. As for the fit, the skirt was roomy and comfortable but the black part at the top I didn‚Äôt care for.  It was more of an empire waist which really made me look very hippy and my chest very small.  I‚Äôm more of a pear shape. The arm holes were also cut too narrow toward the chest so I would have had to find a different bra to work with it."
2.0,Not waterproof. Cold shoveling.
2.0,"It‚Äôs not as slouchy as pictured,  and I have a small head,  it fits fine,  it just doesn‚Äôt really have the slouchy look once it‚Äôs on..."
2.0,"I haven't actually worn the necklace as of yet.  The appearance leaves a lot to be desired, however, I hope once I buy the appropriate matching outfit it will accentuate it.  In theory this sounds good, let's see how this turns out."
2.0,"I used this on a remodel daily for about 4 months over the winter.  It certainly helped me survive when the temp dropped when I had the roof off this house, However within a week I had ripped the battery pocket, nearly clean off, so it was useless.  The plug would not stay in the charging hole and I had to tape it on everyday.  Just recently as it is getting cold I pulled it out just to wear without the heat and the zipper pull broke off.  It worked but fell apart quickly."
2.0,Item looks cheap. chain is flimsy.
2.0,"The threads stripped immediately and the balls were wobbly and unstable. Also, they are not single sided. Bad quality and generally not as advertised. You get what you pay for"
2.0,Cute for the beach but cannot pass as a formal dress. This did not flatter my body what so ever. Not enough fabric to cover my breasts or to do any of the styles that it suggests really.
2.0,my size is XL but this shirt too small
2.0,"This scarf feels &quot;cheap&quot;.  From the weight of the actual scarf, to the crinkly  plastic bag in which it arrived, it does not really convey luxury.  Generally disappointed."
2.0,The legs are very high cut!
2.0,Too shall for grown men.
2.0,"Hated it. White w red? Is NOT white with red. Its in fact hot pink. I loathe pink. It was out of the packaging for 2 minutes till i tossed it in the &#34;give to homeless&#34; pile. I know a girl staying at the bridge downtown that would like it. But i did think of burning it when i realized it was pink. Also, it fit like a medium/large. I'm an xs/s. Thats what i get for being a recluse instead of shopping like a &#34;real&#34; person."
2.0,"Ordered an X-large and received a XXL which fit like a large or smaller.  Sizing on product is off, fits a lot smaller than sized."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like showing two different colored hats and only one was sent
2.0,"Rather thin and even doubled up, you don't get that nice slouch I was looking for.  I gave them to my hubby who is bald and he says that it doesn't stay on his normal sized at all and that it just doesn't 'do' anything for looks - lol.  I have others that are perfect, but I don't have any in a solid color.  I'll keep looking."
2.0,Mask was too large. It kept creeping into my eyes. It was also too hot while singing in it
2.0,Didn‚Äôt even get to try it on because it ran small
2.0,They must have strange cows in China because the surface material of these belts stretches like taffy. It really POs me that merchants can flat out lie about their product with impunity.<br /><br />The description says 100% leather. This is not even 1% leather. And yes it does smell and the smell is of vinyl not leather.<br /><br />Special tanning process my azz. How does vinyl get tanned?<br /><br />The merchant even responds to questions about the material claiming it is 100% leather. IT ISN‚ÄôT<br /><br />The belt looks good. Who knows how long it will last. Because the merchant lies about the material.<br /><br />Someone averse to wearing animal skin might like this product but they will never know because it is misrepresented as leather<br /><br />I gave this two stars only because it does look good out of the box. Lying merchants PO me. In fact any one lying to persuade me POs me
2.0,"The belt kept popping off.  I do have a slight beer belly, so maybe it won't pop off for skinny girls?"
2.0,I bought these for work pants the stitching tore ar the crotch after about 6 times wearing.
2.0,I was really excited to receive this dress. Unfortunately the fabric felt like a plastic bag.
2.0,Broke almost immediately after wearing it.
2.0,"Not fab, very very entry level, but for the price they're not too bad, either.  But first got a huge pair (ordered women's got men's size), second time, thinking ok, they send men's shoes, so I dropped down to the comparaqble men's size and boom.  Got women's shoes 2 sizes too small.  It was funny, actually, I was like Cinderella's step sister trying to get even my toes in....Gave up, upgraded to Tommaso shoes and true Shimano SPD pedals and haven't looked back.. I tried!"
2.0,Very tiny. Almost invisible. If they were bigger they‚Äôd be lovely
2.0,"BEWARE - I ordered a fleece, got it and loved it.  Decided to order another and they sent me a book:("
2.0,Wasn't what I expected... The color is much lighter and it was so hard to get my cards out the &#34;leather&#34; tore.
2.0,Nice bracelet...cheap quality
2.0,"I thought this would offer some sun protection to my neck, it's more just like a wide headband, a really pricey wide headband. Perhaps I misinterpreted its purpose??"
2.0,"Beautiful, doesn‚Äôt get rusty in water, stays gold. but not sturdy, broke within a couple of weeks."
2.0,"bought this for my wife, fits very small for an xxl. more like a medium then an xxl. If your going to buy this keep that in mind.<br />Build is good, it is soft and stretchy."
2.0,"Color was accurate, very soft, but tore at  the seam 3rd time I wore it."
2.0,"The size M is extremely large, looks like L. It is too loose under the arms. I did not like."
2.0,Didn't last long before the seams all cracked.
2.0,"Just too small, like 3 sizes incorrectly small."
2.0,Definitely looks much better in picture but with this purchase you get what you pay for. The pattern is uneven and the inside is a cheap white material not matching the outside red and black pattern. Even if it was black on the inside it would still look better than white. The white really cheapens the jacket.
2.0,It's a difference between being small and the length of the straps and such. It's not being petite or anything but there is too little space between the two boob areas and I don't have a big chest or too broad shoulders. I get constant nip-slips and my boyfriend hates it.
2.0,"disappointed at how thin this is, and worried that it will break easily. Maybe good for a child, not for an adult.  clasp hard to open, and is small."
2.0,i ordered xxl as per their recommendations and it was still small..i wear a 12-14..the xxl was more like a 10-12
2.0,The size is big and it doesn't worth for $14.
2.0,"I think it's important to understand that the large bandana 6 pack order is 6 bandanas that are all black, and that the bandana's are printed only one one side. I had assumed (incorrectly) that the bandana was dyed, so that the white pattern was the undid fabric. They printed the pattern on a black bandana, I'm sured this saved them money, but as bandana's go, these aren't a particularly good value. I think selling point is the size. I use them as rags around the shop. https://amzn.com/B00KMAEJ7S"
2.0,"Very, very small. Ordered the large and it was tiny. Beware. It‚Äôs very cute, but runs super small."
2.0,Cute pic of the gnomes.  That‚Äôs the only thing positive.  Sleeves too long!  I ordered a 2x - super tight around the bottom!  It fits more like a large.  Not at all loose & comfy!!!  And it isn‚Äôt a sweatshirt.  Color me disappointed.
2.0,"I have a pretty severe bunion that at my age, I don‚Äôt plan to fix because of the difficult recovery.  The big toe slants over the second toe and I often wear a spacer to keep it from rubbing.  I thought I would try these socks, which I bought directly from the Orthofeet site.  My review there is unposted (their choice).  Basically, these are regular socks with a 1‚Äù vertical seam from the top of the toe.  When a deformed toe goes into the slot, it makes a jumbled mess of fabric that makes the sock uncomfortable and unwearable.  The fabric on the sock itself is comfortable, although it doesn‚Äôt give a lot of cushioning in the spot where the bunion touches the side of the shoe.  I will remove the seam and go back to spacers and bunion pads."
2.0,Seemed cheaply made and way too small
2.0,"The snap fail in 4 DAYS, but I like the card slot space and zipper space"
2.0,"They look very cheap , not impressed at all."
2.0,"These run super small. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt have a size available above 9. I am usually a true size 9, regular width‚Ä¶ not wide, just normal. These are definitely made for more narrow feet. If you have narrow feet, I‚Äôd order a half size up because they do run SMALL and NARROW. They are cute so I‚Äôve been CRAMMING my feet in them and wearing for ten minutes here and there around the house. Today I have blisters. Wish they had a bigger size available. ORDER A HALF SIZE UP AT LEAST"
2.0,Got for my daughter and just not comfortable for her. They have hidden looking wedge. I have Bare traps &#34;Sana&#34; and love them. Sooo comfortable!!!
2.0,Was probably too small for the fit. Would have been perfect for someone with a large crane
2.0,"When I first got it I loved it.  But of course washed it before I used it.  Washed it with baby detergent, it ran and now doesn't look that great.  So didnt use it when it looked good.  Still use it... it not gonna take a pic with it on him."
2.0,Runs small I could have used a size 11 instead original shoe size is a 9 1/2 but they are still cute
2.0,The Buckle is rubbish!
2.0,"Super thin material. This is a night gown. I wanted wear this outside of the house. Soft, very sheer. Kept as a nightie as the color is pretty and the fabric is soft."
2.0,"The dress is cute, but I don't like the quality of the material at all !!!!!!!!  It feels kind of RUBBERY ............. now I understand why the cleaning instructions says not to put in a hot dryer or iron it."
2.0,"It took a month and a half to arrive, it does not resemble the fur pictured and it was not true to size."
2.0,Shallow pockets. Whatever you put in  them falls out.
2.0,"My daughter loved it and was really excited to wear it.  Two weeks later, it's broken.  One of the jump rings popped open and is gone.  I can probably fix it myself, but it's going to look like I fixed it with a silver vs rose gold jump ring.  Hopefully the seller will replace it?  I'm not super hopeful that it will hold up though."
2.0,"Much smaller than the regular Ikea bags you get in the store.  I was disappointed, returning."
2.0,"Beauiful bag,however much smaller than shown in pictures."
2.0,"Mislabeled. I can't use this item for its intended purpose because it doesn't match USA sizing standards. A size 6 is actually a size 4. The velco top adapts to foot height but not foot length. In addition, velco adjustments must be minimum because the velco is not strong enough to handle forward foot thrust."
2.0,My wife did not like it. Also. It did not to fit.
2.0,"the socks were delivered in a very timely manner.  thank you.  however the design of the white socks with polka dots was so STUPID i can't<br />believe it.  the dots are not printed on the socks they  are sewn. which means there are threads on  each dot, on the inside of the sock.<br />compression socks are NOT regular sock, they are hard to put on. your toes and toe nails get caught on the threads.  i am wearing<br />them inside out.  love dealing with amazon and i am very disappointed with this product.<br /><br />judith lichtenstein. walnut creek, ca."
2.0,It's a cute night shirt but way too small.  Almost 2 sizes to small compared to a Victoria Secret night shirt.  I will regift it to someone else that is more petite.
2.0,Cookies are nice but material is a little weird.  It will work for birthday party but don't think kid will wear after that.
2.0,They came earlier than expected but the white one was about two inches larger than the pink one so it was too big for my head and the pink one is good sized but the mouth is a little distorted.
2.0,"Runs small. Had to return,"
2.0,"These are very bizarre. I ordered the white and all vital areas are fully covered by double fabric, but all other areas are single ply and completely see through. Additionally the seaming around the legs and seat is very strange and unflattering.<br />I wouldn't wear these in public or maybe even around my house without a dress over them nor would I purchase due to the very odd seaming and fit.<br />The seams are tight, but the pants still slip down and require near constant hiking up.<br />These are a miss for me."
2.0,I look pregnant in this top! It fits okay on the top but the rest is big & wide & hangs down from my chest making it look like I have a big belly but I don't. Material is stiff & the wrinkles from how it was folded & shipped won't come out! It's very disappointing.
2.0,"These pants are lightweight material and not very well made as my photos will show. I like the style, elastic waist, self tie belt and hidden zipper. The sewing is sloppy and I probably won‚Äôt wear them to go out in. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and they are regular length pants on me. They ha cuffs."
2.0,"Super cute, however, very small :( very bummed bc it's exactly what I wanted!"
2.0,"While these masks hold up and provide a needed barrier, I had to air them out for three days due to a terrible smell. Even that, there is something lingering."
2.0,"The colors in the dress are beautiful.  The top fits perfectly,  but the waist is about 5 inches too high.  The proportions are way off as far as the waist is concerned.  I don't believe I can ever wear it.... which is disappointing.  I am 5'8&#34; and weigh 155 lbs."
2.0,The rings did not come in a circle- they were both bent out of shape and looked like they were previously worn.
2.0,"I don't buy t-shirts because they don't look good on women who wear larger sizes.  This shirt is like a large shiny t-shirt, not quite nice enough to where to work, but okay for casual situations, just disappointing.  There are so many choices on Amazon for women's tops, but no good way to define what kind of top one is looking for.  There is no way to select sleeve length or type material desired.  I turned to Amazon to look for tops because all the major department stores such as Macy's, JC Penny's, Kohls, and Target have limited selections when you go to their stores.  Basically all they have to choose from is cotton t-shirts.  It's very disappointing!"
2.0,"This jacket represents as the battery to heat the jacket is included.  There is even a paragraph telling you how to use the battery, how long it will stay charged and how fast you can recharge it.  No where in the description does it say the battery is not included.  Why would you sell a heated jacket with no way to heat it?<br /><br />The jacket itself is really nice and super soft inside.  It fits as expected.  We however need it for freezing weather so the heater is a must.<br /><br />I‚Äôm giving the jacket 2 stars simply because it did not come with the represented battery, the description was misleading as you would naturally expect, unless clearly noted that it comes with the battery to heat it."
2.0,"I ordered an XL and it fits like a medium. I'm guessing it's Junior-sized, since a L should've fit me. The colors are also far more bold, heavy on the red, than shown. The fabric is *very* thin."
2.0,This would be good for a casual beach event by how thin and airy it is but definitely not for family photos or more formal functions. It‚Äôs so incredibly thin that you can see nippys without an undershirt on. Got a Medium for a slender body type and is too wide
2.0,"too small, too short and zipper on opposite side - perhaps european.<br />I thought higher price would equate to better product. I was mistaken."
2.0,The wallet was great for about 6 months.  Then the plastic catch broke when opening one day and rendered it useless.  Strong metal components connected with weak plastic.  It won't last.
2.0,"Had to buy grey pants with navy stripe in a pinch and it was easier to do so online then at Dicks, sadly. But you can definitely see the difference between these and the Nike ones he has. Very tight, snorted shorter then expected. My boy is 8yrs old, 108, and 99% of the times wears boys med, could have definitely fit in the X-Large of this style. They are more like a polyester yoga pant than baseball pant,"
2.0,"Way to small around the ankle area, but I will keep them and hopefully wear them next fall/winter."
2.0,Arrived with a button missing. Item was also a bit larger than I thought it would be.
2.0,"I'm 5'1, 115lbs and ordered and small. It's too long and too loose. The material is average. I bought it for a fall/spring dress, but it will be a winter dress with layers."
2.0,5‚Äô1‚Äù 140# 38DD this top just didn‚Äôt fit right and I‚Äôm not sure going up a size would help so I‚Äôm going to return it
2.0,"Nice quality but way too tight. My calf measures 16 1/2"" so I got the XL (recommend for 16""-18""). I'm a nurse and I've woren a lot of compression stockings over the years. These were suffocating my legs. I could only wear them half a day. Try them every day for two weeks but did not losen. I did not put them in the dryer as per instructions. Liked the quality just disappointed in the fit."
2.0,"They look cute, but they fit awkward and make me trip up all time. I scuffed the front of them on day 2 of wearing them. They do not rub or blister, but the front strap is too far forward and pushes my feet back in the shoe...making the toe part stick out more and making it easier to catch when walking."
2.0,Terrible! You get what you pay for! Zipper and other part of the bag broke after two uses.
2.0,"Fits great, Great for working out. But I originally bought this long sleeve shirts as undershirts for work to keep me warm during the winter. They are not meant for that, they made me more cold."
2.0,I thought it was the slip to another dress I bought. YIKES!
2.0,"I'm not sure why this dress has such good reviews. Sometimes I get lucky and find an inexpensive dress that I can accessorize and make it look nice/classy - not the case here. I typically wear a size 10. Im 5'8&#34; with an hourglass figure. I ordered a M and L and neither looked great. If youre under 5'6'' the length should be ok, but it hit me just above my ankles - awkward length. The material is pretty thing so you'd need spanx if you have any bumps/lumps. Worst of all the pockets add bulk to hips and made me look wide. Finally, there is a gap under the armpit that exposed my bra - tacky. If it looked decent I would have kept it to wear around the house or running to the convenience store. Not worth keeping.  Thumbs all the way down."
2.0,HUGE and didn't like the fabric.  Loved the print.
2.0,"Unfortunately I went with a cheaper quicker option and these rainbow ones were very see through. They offer no compression and if you have anything other than nude underwear, or any tattoos it will show right through. Even more so when you bend over or squat. I sent mine back but I guess they could be comfy for around the house if you didn‚Äôt mind them see through."
2.0,"This bag is quite a lot larger than the dimensions given.  And, the snap does not hold the fold over at all.  Therefore, I'm returning it."
2.0,"I thought this band had a different edge than my previous purchases, but it didn't.  The way the edges are open, it easily snags my clothes. Other than that, I loved it!"
2.0,Lil too large
2.0,It says thigh high socks and it‚Äôs really pantyhose. Not at all what I wanted but I already mailed them to my niece and she said they are pantyhose.üò¢
2.0,"Looks better to in the picture. Size runs super small and material is weird and shiny with zero stretch. Ripped the pocket in the 1st 10 minutes of wearing. Usually wear xxl, bought xxxl and it is skin tight. Like a sausage."
2.0,Tthese boots hurt the top of my toes. Too bad they are so nice looking.
2.0,Buckle broke a few weeks ago.  Normal use.
2.0,"Not for larger cups sizes, even though it says it is. If you have natural D's or more, this doesn't do anything flattering."
2.0,Ordered a long sleeved sweatshirt... got a short sleeved t-shirt. Quality is good but wanted a sweatshirt. Maybe just a mistake on the stores end...
2.0,"I just did't like it.  The material has a shine to it, it runs about a size and a half small if you want it to fall like it does in the picture.  The arms are snug."
2.0,Very thin material! I do not expect these to last long.
2.0,This is a very low quality sweater. The yarn is very fuzzy and light. This sweater is cute on the first wear but it is not warm. I dont expect to get many wears out of it before it pills up or shreads.
2.0,"I took the advice of others and ordered a size up. This was far too large and the color was off, so I returned."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:8814d9ded1c33866adcd631ed0a28aeb]] I love the color and the size was perfect. But on the second day of me wearing it the glitter strip lifted on the band.
2.0,"They were cute and I was excited to wear them. I placed some of the studs in my ears and after a fee hours my ears had started to turn colors. I read before buying and it claimed to be stainless steel but I'm not sure how when it did that after a fairly short amount of time. Also, one pair was broken when I got them but I didnt mind, it wasnt one of the main pairs I wanted anyway."
2.0,"Pendant was beautiful, however the clasp was junk. Would not stay latched and came loose from the leather cord first time out of the package"
2.0,Clingy fabric that feels like plastic.  Should have returned.  Put it on twice to wear but I never made it out of the house with it because of the feel of the fabric.  You may see it at Goodwill.
2.0,"The pilling in this material is insane. I got a pair of these to wear around the house during the pandemic , but the pilling between my thighs and on my rear is CRAZY only after a few wears... maybe 5?"
2.0,Way too large on me. I'm 5'1 100lbs. It gave me no shape and look boxy on me. It was very large on the waist
2.0,Super cute if you're under 5 feet tall
2.0,"I loved the look of the dress and the quality seems good. I ordered off the chart and it was still a little too tight. I could have made do with that but the real bummer and why I am giving it 2 stars is because it barely fit halfway down my calves. I am 5'9 so while I am tall and used to clothes running short, this was beyond short and can't even wear it. Very bummed."
2.0,"It looks good.... until you put it on. The first time I wore it, the wire popped out."
2.0,The longer during day you wear it it looses its shape
2.0,"Pretty pendant, but the chain was definitely NOT 24‚Äù. It‚Äôs literally a choker. So disappointed with the chain length. It also took several weeks to arrive and no tracking information."
2.0,"Love it, my sister and girl friend both want me to order them one."
2.0,"Fits kind weird, points out from the face and had a weird shape. It‚Äôs also very wrinkly. It‚Äôs not as breathable as what I would like."
2.0,The fit is 2 sizes smaller and it is way to hard to exchange or return for your money back it comes from China
2.0,"My husband literally laughed at me and ask what I was wearing. He has never had a negative thing to say about anything I put on. He truly thought I was joking. I guess its not for everyone, I love how it looks in the photo! I may try to make a kimono type thing out of it or something.<br />-Stacey"
2.0,I bought it for my husband routine to the gym but was no more than 2 weeks used that it seems ripped. I show you the photo. I am so unsatisfied
2.0,"It took awhile to get the goggles & for a moment I thought maybe I was robbed because the tracking number said the package didn‚Äôt exist & Amazon didn‚Äôt seem to know anything either. The package was also late. However, I contacted the seller which responded quickly & I did in fact receive my goggles & they look like the photo/description. The feel of the goggles seems conformable enough. I have yet to test how fog free they actually are."
2.0,"Initially, I loved this Ring.  My wife got it for me because i have a very physical job and can't wear metal ring without getting it caught on thing and wither lost or damaged.<br /><br />  I, like many guys have the problem of my hands swelling and shrinking with different activities and ambient temperatures.  At first, this ring fit perfect, did a great job of staying snug regardless of the surrounding circumstances.  That only lasted about 2 weeks though.....<br /><br />  In a short 2 weeks, it became severely discolored, changing from gold, to Purple......  what????  weird, but true.  i put up with that for a couple days, until  it just fell off my hand.  I don't know if this is typical, or if i just got a dud, but i don' plan on buying another.  Sorry, I would post pictures, but i got mad and threw it out.<br /><br />Please mark this review as useful  =)<br /><br />save time and click here to buy.... if you dare lol<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EVQ41XA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=unboxutopia-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01EVQ41XA&linkId=b4c24a2849eb6e53fba6fea775f5e2f7"
2.0,Very cheap materials.  Not worth half the price.  I would not recommend.
2.0,Brought this to put on my girls ear for pictures did not stick at all waste of money
2.0,Looks good. Clasp / band however different story. Came off twice but for the price.....
2.0,The bathing suit runs small from top to bottom but fits well everywhere else. I had to return it though because it was too uncomfortable. The Sweetheart neck line is very pretty though.
2.0,"The clip on hooks were too loose, which resulted in the lens falling off the glasses. Had to return them."
2.0,And colors are closer to fuschia and lavender
2.0,Item too long.
2.0,"Kinks on the rim made the hat rim ""crimped"".<br />Couldn't get a nice circular brim."
2.0,Nice and comfy. The F.P. logo is stiched into the flip flops. Looks very cool. Love and recommend.<br />Update: Less than 4 months later... Ripped on the left shoe. 2 different areas. I'm very disappointed. I don't wear them often and they split already.
2.0,"I ordered a Medium, which is my regular size. It runs very small in the chest area.  If are a 34D, you may need to size up.  I ordered the Spruce green, but it looks more of a gray color."
2.0,Received the product within a day. Color is same as description but the cloth is not good.It did not fit me properly
2.0,"My wife is not happy with product, it does not cover the enter stomach and waist as it shows in advertised picture. she is not using it any more."
2.0,Very nice necklace however the moment I tried putting it in....the clasp broke off üëéüòù
2.0,I returned this dress. It was huge and the material was that thin shiny material. They credited my account very fast though.
2.0,"The item is engraved with the pattern of a sanddollar, but only on one side. This gives the item a look of very poor quality."
2.0,Looked like a maternity dress on me. Too much gathering around the waist and fabric too stiff to flow nicely.
2.0,"It looks nice but too small! I couldn't even wear them, they don't fit."
2.0,"Cute ring but it was massive, it was a good 2 or 3 sizes too big. Really dissaponted."
2.0,"I've had the brown walk hero flip flops for about a year or so, and I love them.  They have great arch support.  So I went to my orders to buy again in another color.  Only changed the color to black.<br /><br />The new ones arrived but were very different from my other pair.  This new pair had very little arch support - very disappointing.  I had to send them back."
2.0,These are NOT the purple I ordered!! And now my<br />Cosplay for The Anime Convention I have been waiting for it ruined!! These are like fuchsia and not purple like the picture. I posted a picture and the sports bra I have on is supposed to be the color of the pants!
2.0,"I bought one size larger 2XL then what I am XL and it fit like a L other then that it's a nice shirt, just beware"
2.0,"Not at all what I was looking for. The material is quite different from the other pairs of stance socks I have, and right out of the box the stitching around the top of the sock was unraveling. They also didn't come up to the knee, which is probably more my fault for not checking the details"
2.0,Pretty earings but it's made very cheap.  The red strings are uneaven cut yarn; and the metal has bumps from a bad paint job.  Very disapointing
2.0,"They stink so bad, I immediately washed them on a gentle cycle in a mesh bag and the inserts fell apart. They still stink so I washed them again minus the inserts. Very disappointed. I tried it on right away and they seemed to fit okay.<br />Update now washed 3 times and you can smell the thing under a heavy top."
2.0,Order two size up got an medium and it was to small
2.0,"I believed your ad that it was ""Easy On!"" I feel stupid."
2.0,I put it in my suitcase and got all wrinkled and couldn‚Äôt adjust it or stay up ir sagged down. Definitely not recommended.
2.0,"The fabric is just wrong for pj's. The shirt is a no go completely, I will hold onto the pants though for lounging. Really odd fabric choice, who wants to lounge around in what feels like a loose rash guard set..."
2.0,"Pro: Price, less than $2 each. Made well.<br />Con: Thinner than hospital socks.  Not XXL, I'm a 11 shoe size, these are tight just coming up to lower ankle. Received only 5 in package instead of ordered 6. At $2 each not worth effort to return entire package to get one pair."
2.0,"Not very comfortable. Sole seems too firm, doesn't let you move very easily."
2.0,I thought it would be nicer on me but didn't really care how the elastic band fitted
2.0,"Okay so normally when people say things are really small, I‚Äôm fairly skeptical because it‚Äôs hard to say when everyone is built differently. Well I got a medium which is my normal size and it fit like an extra extra small. I was so crammed into the dress, I had a major White Chicks moment. Between the cackling and tears and the fact I couldn‚Äôt bend my arm the right way to take a picture, there is no evidence...but trust. SIZE UP."
2.0,"I received this duck Apple Watch band in on Monday afternoon and by Wednesday (of that same week) I noticed some peeling of the graphic coming up on the edge‚Ä¶<br /><br />I‚Äôm super disappointed by it. I really really loved this Apple Watch band, but I‚Äôm afraid that it just won‚Äôt hold up."
2.0,"Bought 2 Pairs, Both arrived damaged.  Both pairs had bent  springs on the bridge. A lot of care must be taken if you want it to last.  Great value for polarized glasses, that look good."
2.0,Fits my wife like a baby doll should've been wearing it. A lot shorter than what she was expecting.
2.0,This dress was not flattering on me. It made me look bigger than I am because of where it started flowing out.I returned this item.
2.0,"to sum it up in a phrase, You get what you pay for. Shame on me"
2.0,"After 6 months normal wear, the pin holding the lock down bar snapped. Disappointed.  Will go elsewhere to replace."
2.0,Interesting concept. Based on the pin you have you need the multiple options. The only concern I have it the thickness limits the pin you can use as well as the size of the hole.. otherwise it is a cute idea.
2.0,Not comfortable.  Fish net inside feels irritating.  No elastic straps. Odd cotton strap adjustment.  I cut out the fish net liner on one to see if it feels better.  Keep looking.  Something better must be available.
2.0,This looks nothing like the picture lol it fits ok just not the same pink color and it‚Äôs stretchy not cotton at all.
2.0,The colors were super vibrant and the suits are very cute however they were way too small. Daughter wears a size 14 in jeans and we normally do a 12.5 bathing suit from kohl‚Äôs so we ordered a size 14 is these and they were way too tight for top and bottom. Had to return. Also - see the picture - the bottoms were NOT the same size
2.0,I don't like the material at all.  The back is super cute but the front looks like a nightgown.  Returned.
2.0,"It was small compared to other clothing my child has that size. The waist band and shirt were tight, but the pants were baggy around the pockets like 1980s style. I didn‚Äôt like how they were made."
2.0,"I selected 34E from the drop down menu which shows up as 34DD in my cart. I laughed when it arrived‚Äîwith all the padding and smallish cups, there was no way my 34E tatas were going to fit in there. Better suited for a B or small C cup. I returned immediately."
2.0,Unlike the mando pistol that is to scale this is very small and not even close to scale. I wish it was larger
2.0,Looks great but stretches out & becomes too loose after just a couple wears
2.0,"Low quality polyester fabric, super wrinkly."
2.0,Poor quality and thin
2.0,Looked a little cheaper then I would have liked
2.0,"Cheap, uncomfortable junk.<br /><br />I was expecting cheap sandals, but nothing THIS cheap. They fit OK, but they're horribly uncomfortable, not worth wearing at any price."
2.0,This sweater does not have lantern sleeves. It fits very slouchy. The picture and description are deceiving.
2.0,Pattern is so pretty but runs way small!
2.0,Not easy to install. Quick release would be nice
2.0,Its awsome! But my dog chewed it off. Lol
2.0,I had to return- too tight.
2.0,"I chose this rating because the product is not what I expected. Would not recommend the product to anyone, ever."
2.0,"Very pretty style! However, I would recommend for a young girl or teenager vs a grown woman as they are very small in size so I think all the beautiful detail is lost!"
2.0,Just opened them. Questioning quality.
2.0,Definitely not like the picture. Model must be a size 2 in the largest size made to have the fullness the picture shows. Keeping because it will be a good dress for a Cowboy wedding I'm going to in October that's outdoors.
2.0,I saw this bracelet and fell in love! I ordered it and once it arrived I was very disappointed to notice that firstly it looked better in the picture( still cute though ) and secondly unless you have the wrist of a 10 year old I dont know how you are supposed to fasten it correctly! I have a small wrist...so much so that I sometimes have issues with buying watches and bracelets because they dont fit right. The way you are suppose to clasp it you would have to have the wrist of a child. There is a way to fasten it so that you attach it to the chain links themselves and not the other end of the clasp but it look less than desirable once finished(hence the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. I would not have bought this had I know it was so small.
2.0,Tiny and didn't look as good as pictured but oh well it was cheap. Can't expect much.
2.0,Dress is not as pictured. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and the hem came to just above the knees. The problem is that the hem curves and the sides of the dress ruch up. I looks strange. The ruching in the front  is not as pronounced as it is in the model. It‚Äôs going back.
2.0,The cup inserts were way too small
2.0,"The flowers on the sleeves clings to the fabric part of the dress causing pulls. Also, the fabric is so thin, you can see thru the dress. The dress needs lining sewn into the dress."
2.0,"I was excited to get these but the post are so short, to short for me."
2.0,Bought this for my daughter who is 10. She's about 4'10 80 lbs. Based on reviews I bought a bigger size and it was still TOO small. She couldn't even get both arms in. Super cute but extremely small.
2.0,"I like a purse with a middle zip area that separates the purse, this purse has a small one, and did not give me three separations,  therefore all my things would be in the bottom area.."
2.0,The chain was delivered today. Opened the pouch and it was one big knot. So tangled it took and hour to undo it. Very disappointed with was delivered
2.0,Bad quality....
2.0,It not only squeezes the chest but also the stomach which caused my kid to not wear any longer than 2 hours
2.0,Looks nice but feels incredibly cheap as it's way to thin...so much so that it feels totally out of place in a nice watch. Avoid.
2.0,"I like that shirt but the size is small in the shoulders, it feels like fat guy in a little coat !"
2.0,Looks much different in person. Will be sending back immediately.
2.0,Fits great but I got yellow and you can see through it
2.0,Runs small and seams come unfknd
2.0,This fell off!
2.0,Weird material. Not horrible but runs small.
2.0,Each piece lasted one night cute if you don‚Äôt mind wasting money. However the quality is trash...the design is cute
2.0,"I was hoping to wear these with ballet flats, but the socks poke out of the opening of the shoe, right near my toes"
2.0,cute but 2 stones are missing.<br />small sadness.
2.0,they look good but broke 2nd day I used them and i'm not that hard on things
2.0,"The top was too big for me, and the straps were too long.  Was a little bummed about it."
2.0,I ordered the large but is very small
2.0,Purchased these for my 80 yr old father and they were too tight on his calves and around his stomach.  Actually returned the pants.
2.0,The costume is great if your going for a party city/spirit halloween look. The dress looks nice but the material takes away from the look. The material looks cheap and for the price u might as well just go to a halloween store.
2.0,"Amazing dress for the price. I'm 5'2, however, I had to return because the front is way way too short that it almost didn't cover."
2.0,Love the charms but didn‚Äôt receive a single Virgo in the entire pack
2.0,These are lovely looking but the clasp does not stay secure. The bracelet was constantly falling off to the point that I didn't realize the last time it fell off and it's lost. Only got to enjoy it for only a week.
2.0,Color and style are amazing.. two lights went out already though after only wearing a few days :(
2.0,Love the look of the product but has an odor that makes me not able to wear it...
2.0,"Great price, but order larger size than usual."
2.0,This is way smaller than expected. The model must be wearing a size 3 times her regular to make it appear as shown. Highly disappointed.
2.0,"I loved this purse.  It held everything I needed it to with great organization and room to spare. The material is so light.  However... this was my second one in just a few months.  The first one, the strap came apart at the seam where it attached the the purse, a few weeks after the return period closed.  So I ordered a second one thinking maybe I just got a bad one.  Two weeks after the return period closed, the internal lining has now separated from the wall of the purse, creating a huge hole where all of my stuff is falling through into the large pocket.  I am so sad because this purse was perfect for my needs.  I'm just not going to take a chance on a third one."
2.0,"This would have been really cute if proportioned correctly.  The nose ball is huge, which makes the poodle look comical."
2.0,"As long as you follow the size chart and measure yourself it‚Äôs pretty accurate. The chest was pretty busty but not a big deal. Great quality for the price. But after I got this one and ordered 4 more, they magically couldn‚Äôt get them in on time and it won‚Äôt let you cancel or refund."
2.0,Tight. Short on the legs. Not for me.
2.0,I like the material but it run way too small
2.0,"Cheap quality, fits small, very uncomfortable."
2.0,These heels are so cute! But very uncomfortable. These heels are for pictures only nothing more. I would not not wear these heels out anywhere.
2.0,This jacket arrived late and dirty. I ordered a M and I am 5'6&#34; 120lbs and it fit fine in the shoulders and bust but was huge on the waist and hips. Fabric would have been fine had it not had dirt spots on it.
2.0,I love The concept of these tights. They look great on all the models. I am a size 12 and I purchased the plus size having read the reviews. It was either the total wrong size or not meant for anybody over the size 8
2.0,It's pretty tacky. It looked more orange/yellow than rose gold.
2.0,Dress is so pretty...but seriously 3xl should fit me loosely.  Perhaps it should say 3xl in munchkin land (like in the Wizard of Oz).  I should know better to buy some things on line...
2.0,"The strap that comes up between the toes is too long. It creates an uncomfortable, unsightly bump. It makes no sense - because the thick horizontal band that goes across the top of the foot has NO give, so if you have enough foot to fill in the toe strap - your foot isn't making it past the band anyway. I have very normally proportioned feet - my toes aren't too short. Maybe if you have really long, thick toes?<br /><br />If you do, though, maybe you should avoid sandals."
2.0,"This skirt was true to size, however the color was much darker than presented and the fabric is extremely shinny.  I am thankful for the free return because this skirt is just not me."
2.0,"Cheap material, cheap workmanship. The colors on their pictures were not even close to the real top.  I ordered khaki.  Nothing is attractive in this product.  Returned!"
2.0,Product is not made for medium size calf people. The boots were nice just very small
2.0,"The material is almost like a bag, it covered everything but did nothing for my shave, I looked really dumpy actually, I am curvy with large breast and hips and the material just hands between my breast and hips."
2.0,"These leggings are cute. They are a bit see through which makes the black color actually look dark grey. I am 5'3"" 117 lbs. My measurements are exactly a size small according to their size chart, but the leggings are 1 size too big. Not sure if I'm going to return them or try to shrink them."
2.0,The stone we received is mostly grey with very tiny spots of the color. Definitely not like the picture shown.
2.0,It hard to screw the back down.
2.0,"Got this because my wife is pregnant, and has belly button ring. We know that it would look bad if you didn‚Äôt take care of it so we got this. Unfortunately the balls at each end were broken within a week. One fell off and broke into two, the other just fell off and would stay screwed on. The only good thing is that the elastic/rubber rod stays in so that‚Äôs what she uses now.<br />Pros: rod stays put<br />Cons: both balls at each end broke very quickly<br />Cheap"
2.0,These nightgowns leave glitter everywhere. Because their is glitter on the sleeve they have gotten glitter on their faces which has somehow gotten in their eyes. This has happened several times.I will say they are very fancy and cute. But the glittrr is frustrating.
2.0,This shirt was very boxy. I felt like a blimp in it lol
2.0,Earrings look nice but fall out of ear very easily
2.0,"I bought this in 3 colors: black, red, and light pink. The fabric is super thin so I have to wear nipple covers when I wear the pink suit. The fabric isn't very comfortable; it feels like the thin, stretchy polyester companies use to make Halloween costumes. The cut for your booty is also SUPER high. I'm on the more conservative side and don't like my booty hanging out for everyone to see, so that was disappointing. You're literally wearing a thong cos the fabric doesn't stay put and rides up your butt pretty badly. Save your money!"
2.0,Tiny. Bought for elementary school kids but fits maybe toddlers? Super short.
2.0,"These are not soft, I mean if you like walking barefoot you‚Äôll like these because they are like cardboard.  Yikes"
2.0,"Okay product, no way it will stay on my head."
2.0,These do not block blue light. Cute frames though. But not doing anything.
2.0,Dress too short. Goes above the knee
2.0,i returned this because the small was too big. the bottoms were too big for my waist and the side of the pants had a hole in it. The top was mad for someone with large breast and the triangles cam under my armpits. it was a horrible fit and poor quality.
2.0,Faux fur is flimsy and not attached very well for a grade school kids..looks amazing in the picture though!
2.0,"My son needed angel wings for a Christmas performance.  When these arrived I was surprised how much they look like a DIY project.  Literally cardboard held together with glue and tape.  They did the job and looked ok from afar, but feathers were falling off by the end of the night.  I would say suitable for a one-time event, but don't waste your money if you want something that can be used more than once.  I can't speak to the halo and wand as we did not use them."
2.0,Very confusing to put on and took a long time. Doesn't turn out like the picture
2.0,"YISEVEN Men's Lightweight Water Resistant Packable Down Jacket, black, L<br /><br />This is smaller than large jackets I've bought from US brands. The sleeves are short and narrower. It's tighter around the chest. If you're a tall guy, order a size up so you can get longer sleeves. T<br />Outside pockets have invisible zippers which are ok for dresses, pillowcases, etc. but not for outerwear (too tiny and flimsy zipper pull and frail zipper teeth).<br /><br />The only thing I like about this jacket is that it has large inside bottom pockets (but they don't have closures)<br /><br />The quality and materials used are similar to jackets you'd find at AliEx. This isn't worth $39.99. For just an additional $10, I have a Levi's jacket that's more than twice better than this in quality."
2.0,Leather scrapes OFF
2.0,"Although I am pleased with the performance of this product, I have a serious concern and issue on the pieces that connects the wire into the blue housing. The plastic piece has split and no longer provides any protection to the actual wires. I have exposed yellow and white wires coming out of the blue housing which means there is tension being placed on the soldering inside the unit. I am very concerned on the possibility of this shorting out and being a fire issue. This is an integral part of this unit and should really be a much better design.<br /><br />I would not be asking for a refund as I am very pleased with the performance, but I do feel this may be a manufacturing defect. I can assure you that I am extremely cautious when pulling the dryer from my shoes, boots and skates. I would very much appreciate having this item replaced as I do believe it should still be under warranty. Any help is appreciated."
2.0,Strap is youth sized. I can‚Äôt get it to fit on my adult wrist. I guess you could get a replacement if you want.
2.0,"I have bought other 90D leggings before and loved the quality. I bought this pair and another, and they fit and feel great, but after one wear each and the first wash, they both started unraveling at the crotch! ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è I will be looking to see if I can replace them, and try again. Very disappointed."
2.0,This was very poorly made but it served the purpose after I Trimmed threads and pressed it
2.0,"There is nothing ‚Äûcotton‚Äú in this skirt as stated in the description,  at least not in the red version. It is made from 100% modal, and it feels like it, pretty flimsy. It fits well at the waist but is too tight at the hip so it slides up, not good for a skirt that is cut very short already. Seems like the designers only know how to cut a straight line. If you have a body like a pencil you may like it, but still there is a problem with deceptive fabric description."
2.0,Unfortunately only 2/3 of the 40 lights worked when I recieved them. About 10 others only had little battery and/or loose connections..
2.0,When I washed in Cold water it shrank!
2.0,Cute and good price but Screws that hold on handles unscrew and fall of.
2.0,I ordered an extra large. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 170 and it was too little. It runs small.
2.0,"I did not like this product. It does not fit on ones head as it looks in the the picture. I would've not rated this product because I do not have anything good to say about it, but the seller insisted."
2.0,"NOT ""high waist""; NOT ""tummy control"".  Extremely cheaply made, extremely poor quality, Very Disappointing!<br />I'll make a note of this brand name (NexiEpoch) and won't buy from them again.<br />Note that the waist band itself is barely 1/2"" wide (I measured it) and at the usual waist position; I don't think this manufacturer understands what ""high waisted"" means.  The pockets are weird, with the top of the pocket waaaay down the leg (not far above the knee), shaped very narrow and straight (as if it were made for a long carving knife).  At 5'3"" and 121 pounds, a size Large should have been fine for me but these are skin tight (like they used ""tummy control"" fabric for the entire thing).  Sheer incompetence!!  I hate these!!<br />I'll be sure to NEVER buy anything from this manufacturer (NexiEpoch) again!"
2.0,"This hoodie is of very thin material. Loose fit (too big). Considering the price, this does not meet my expectations."
2.0,1/4th arrived unsown & unusable!!
2.0,"If you're hoping to cover maybe 2 sizes with some stretch in the fabric, forget it.  None at all.  AND it runs VERY small.  I went up a waist size and it's still too small."
2.0,"This forearm cover is nice to have, either for added warmth or to help protect your arms from the sun (though I don't know about the looks, but who cares, gotta protect yourself!). The material is quite stretchy, so it fits snugly without being too tight.<br /><br />My only complaint is that after 2 washes it has started to unravel a bit at one end, so I don't have high hopes for the durability. But these are fairly inexpensive so replacing them isn't too big a deal."
2.0,"the earrings are a fine quality and they look cute but the images are not the same earrings as the ones i received. they look very similar but have square studs that are very small, instead of the circular  or hexagonal studs depicted in the images."
2.0,"the material was fine, I bought the black one. It had no stretch, and it runs small. I did not like the fit at all."
2.0,Waist band twists and tangles. Would not purchase again.
2.0,Fit was good but poor quality of material. Had flaws in it. Like little frayed spots.
2.0,this was just weird fitting for me. almost like I needed a half size down. it just fit awkwardly. had to return. I did like the pattern and style. it just didn't fit right
2.0,"Would‚Äôve been fine, but the zipper broke the first day. :-("
2.0,"Well, it doesn't look like the picture at all besides that face it is in a Death Note shape. I've seen other pictures that people have posted of theirs and the one I received is a dull brass color. The surface and inside is slightly scuffed with a few scratches. Its just that it isn't the color that I was expected at all."
2.0,Did not fit as expected. You need to go up a size or 2. I wear a size 8 and my heels were sticking off the back of the shoe.
2.0,I was really excited about these. I have a long torso so I like having undershirts because most shirts are really short on me. But these were a disappointment. The lace doesn‚Äôt stretch like the rest of the shirt which would have been ok but the lace detached on most of the tanks after the first time I wore them.
2.0,Cute pattern...way too large.
2.0,The band I wanted the most was the purple one and one side was slit and missing the pin. Its completely unusable.
2.0,"The item came folded so there's a few creases that won't come out and show on the mask. It also collapsed one side of the eye area making it nearly impossible to see out of. Because of this the face is pretty distorted and asymmetrical. There is discoloration on the top that cheapens the look with a poor paint job. It's extremely tight to get on and I'm female with a not so big head, so larger headed people may struggle. The colors aren't as vibrant as the advertised pics. Overall just bummed with the product. No wow factors here."
2.0,The hat was cheaply made and not worth a cent over $9.00. A child would have this thing destroyed in an hour.
2.0,"does not fit correctly to the frame, due to the incorrect size, its obviously not easy to install. as the original glass. The polarization is very minimal where it dos not really effect and glares. Whether you are driving a boat in the ocean or a car on the road of  Florida weather you really need Polarisation from the glare of the sun. When driving on the road it can rain and then be sunny causing a l ot of bright glares.<br /><br />I have tried calling the company to see if i could get the correct cut  or get one thats actually polarised. so far I have not heard back from them<br /><br />I gave two stars for the fact that the lens itself is very nice, its a lot more clear than the original ones my arnette came with. its also a bit lighter. You cant feel as much, but it does the job. also the product did arrive early then expected for those reasons I gave it a 2.  If the company calls me back and gives me the correct lenses I would def bump the stars to 5.."
2.0,I have had it for 7 months and the long strap attachment broke.  I can no longer use the shoulder strap which is how I carry my purse. I liked it up to this point.
2.0,"fits too big, I don't like it at all"
2.0,"The Googlies fell out almost immediately. Until then, they were hilarious."
2.0,Hurts to wear when I sleep. Easy to put on
2.0,"The photo looked great online, but the reality is that these look like cheap earrings, unfortunately.  They're cute and all, but you can't hide the cheap looking aspect..."
2.0,It wasnt the way i want it but cool
2.0,It was VERY flimsy. Not well made at all. It just looks like 1 necklace when you put it on.
2.0,NOT self piercing which is why I bought them
2.0,"Ordered this for my wife.  She did not get the dress that is pictured.  It was a totally different product.  Size was also way to big,  Thank goodness for free returns."
2.0,Annoying because the lining isn‚Äôt attached to the inside of the gloves so they are next to impossible for a toddler to put these on in assisted and without hassle even as mittens! Buy some that has the lining attached and save yourself time and frustration!
2.0,Ripped out butt first day
2.0,"This is exactly what my daughter wanted but I had to return it twice. It had a hole in the top on the first two. The first one that came didn‚Äôt have the battery pack, the second one didn‚Äôt have the remote and the third one that came wasn‚Äôt all white it had gray in it too and the remote that came didn‚Äôt work. We still kept the third one because we didn‚Äôt have time to return again and she needed it for an event."
2.0,Not a slouch beanie for an adult. Way too small
2.0,"Super tight, sent back."
2.0,"unfortunately, i thought this was a speedo goggle cause I was searching for a speedo goggle and the search showed these...<br />I don't think I'll keep using them, they may be ok but not for my needs<br /><br />thanks,"
2.0,Loved them when I got it. The case is the best thing it comes with. Dropped it once and the black cat eyes broke.
2.0,Fabric is thin.  Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture.  Color is lighter.  Front isn‚Äôt as low as it appears in picture.
2.0,"The product first tight. I generally wear a large but ordered and XXL it is still a little snug. The fabric is not a true cotton, it's more of a spandex material. It is bright and a nice print."
2.0,I did not like the material or the fit
2.0,Not a great product but decent i guess. Was ok for the price
2.0,Demasiado chiquito parece paraninfo
2.0,You need a small neck for this.
2.0,Love the packers and nice look and fit but im not allergic to anything and this left a rash on my wrist
2.0,"I love the look of this watch band. The only problem is the pin holes are to small. When I went to install the watch pins one side went in perfectly, the other side the pin hole was to small."
2.0,"The feathers fall out extremely easily, the material is very itchy. For what it‚Äôs worth it‚Äôs not good quality. Better off going to 5andBelow."
2.0,I am returning this
2.0,Runs super small!  Cute t-shirt but order 2 sizes up and do not put in the dryer!
2.0,Other then cute they are expensive for what they are you have to twist the hoop sideways to put them in and  they don't fasten into place which makes it feel cheap. Not very happy.
2.0,"These will not last if your daughter is in ballet. Honestly, it's better just to spend a few extra bucks and get leather shoes. My daughter wore these once a week for three months and by the end each shoe had a hole in the toe and they were stained really bad."
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt fit like picture very disappointing
2.0,too tight around the legs.
2.0,They ripped and tore very quickly!
2.0,"Too big all over. I normally wear a medium top but after reading the reviews that said the shirt runs big, I decided on a small. Well the small was so long it looked like a dress. Not to mention, the mid section is much too big. It reminded me of a maturity top. I did not return it but gave it to my cousin who normally wears an xl. I gave it 2 stars because it is a cute concept, but the cut/size is wayyyy off!"
2.0,Color is not exactly rose gold. Holds well
2.0,It not like the pictures its very tight and it take one phone the leather nice but wrong desgin
2.0,"Product fit well prior to washing.  Thought I might even buy another pair as it is soft and light weight.  However, after washing, it shrunk to the point I‚Äôm not even comfortable wearing it.  Quite disappointing"
2.0,"The embroidery on this is beautiful. However, it is unstitched and that's why it says:Free size! for you to stitch it to your size, which I didnt notice at first. BUT, YOU DO HAVE TO MAKE THE PANT! They send you the material and the embroidery material for the bottom of the pant, and you have to completely make the pant! Now THAT it doesnt say! I can make them so I'm not too bumbed out, but if you have no sewing experience you will need to take to someone to finish this up for you."
2.0,Basic ... runs big.
2.0,"After wearing it about 10 times, the pocket liner ripped. Either the coat has a defect or it is not a quality made product."
2.0,Super cute but runs about 2 sizes too small. I ordered a large it found barely get it over my head.
2.0,Def. not a bracelet for adults...it looked cheap and worn...not happy with product...will be sticking to the old fashioned glass eyes instead.
2.0,Recommend ordering a size up. It will also shrink :)
2.0,"The material is so thin. It‚Äôs not a jacket by any means. In 50-60 degree weather it‚Äôs fine. It isn‚Äôt water proof either. Very nice design, but not very functional."
2.0,Cheap elastic thread stretched within two days. I‚Äôll have to restring it.
2.0,"Be wary; this dress is not for plus size. The dress fit like a glove since it was customized, what i didnt realize upon ordering and not being told is that this is a wrap dress and the only thing keeping you from flashing the audience of the wedding is 2 flimsy snaps! It wraps and snaps, the snap is only stitched on by 2 stitches. As a busty woman wearing an H cup bra my experience with these flimsy snaps is HORRIBLE! Just be ware before ordering, they also dont allow returns so i feel this is useful information before you order your dress! I felt super anxious luckily i had another dress as back up‚Ä¶ one wrong move in this dress and its a free for all, i didnt even try sitting!"
2.0,Wanted to like this but disappointed that Black Panther is left out. Returned.
2.0,"This just didn't fit properly.  I ordered a XXXL first and the top (cups) was extremely large.  I reordered a XXL and the tops was still too large, but the body was just a bit too snug. This just wasn't a good fit for me."
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 180-200 pounds I received the order it was long nothing that heals couldn‚Äôt fix. But the dress is tooo glittery. I opened the bag glitter everywhere. Needless to say  I returned it couldn‚Äôt deal with the glitter
2.0,Buttons on bottom hem missing when it arrived‚Ä¶.
2.0,"I found the fit to be nice. It was very long. But, could be tied at the bottom. The material and overall quality left something to be desired for me. I personally did not enjoy the material."
2.0,"Much, much smaller than advertise.  Detail on only one side and flat on the other."
2.0,"The swimsuit style itself is very cute, however I was disappointed on how it fit. The stitching is poor quality and sloppy on the chest area, its uneven on one side, and there is alot of fabric just sticking out. I'm 5'3, weight 137lb and a size 34D. I missed the deadline to return it, going to consider somehow getting it tailored."
2.0,Lentes malos se da√±aron ni un mes de uso.
2.0,"Much wider than expected, not like the photo."
2.0,I got a large based on reviews. I'm 5'2 and 130lbs. It's too big and long. It looks like a box on me. I would say order your normal size.
2.0,Very disappointed. It isn't the same as pictured. It has a gathered front and its shorter in the front than the picture depicts
2.0,Not quite &#34;one size fits all &#34; Will have to have the altered.
2.0,"Masks are well made, but have an unpleasant odor upon opening the individually wrapped masks.  Masks shrink a little after washing and drying making them almost too small for adults.  Because of the shrinkage, I would not buy again.  Picture is of a laundered mask on top of an unwashed one."
2.0,foged up
2.0,The value is great the qualit'y is trash. This<br />Necklace has lost it shine in last then 30 days.
2.0,We ordered this skirt for Tennis clinics but I had to return it as I thought the material was not as expected it seemed rough to me... but i have to give  points to the design wow what a stylish fit... amazing design and superb fit ... no doubt about that but unfortunately I had to return it.. hope to buy more products from this seller. thanks
2.0,"These shoes looked really cute, but broke after just two weeks of use, the piece of metal that holds the Velcro strap in place keeps coming off, so my son can‚Äôt even wear these. Plus the lights on one shoe only worked the first time we used them, now they no longer light up on one side."
2.0,Horrible quality and very see through. I tried it on just because. But as soon as I opened the package I knew I was sending it back.
2.0,not for people with big boobs
2.0,"These continuously kept riding down. I have a thousand pairs of yoga pants and none have done this. I had to repeatedly pull them up until I just took them off. They were not too large or small. They fit, but kept working their way down to expose my butt crack. Horrible."
2.0,The color of the picture is not the color of bra I received. Still comfortable and fits well but I was expecting a light grey bra and instead I got a dark grey bra with light grey accents.
2.0,It looked homemade and flimsy.
2.0,Doesn't look as nice in person
2.0,Earrings were delivered on time. The stone seems to be more like plastic than coral. Very disappointed.
2.0,Cheaply made. Basically an wire with led lights soldered on.... Does not compare to actual &#34;Wheel Brightz ‚Ñ¢&#34;
2.0,"The fit is fairly flattering, though the neckline on mine is nothing like the picture. My complaint is that this dress is intensely glittery. I look like tinsel on a Christmas tree. It is also a VERY thin material. I wanted to love it, but unfortunately I will be returning."
2.0,"regretful purchase, so cheap I can't even play it off"
2.0,"I absolutely loved this ring. It's beautiful and when I got it, it looked just like the picture. But unfortunately the main piece fell off less than a month after I got it. As pretty as it is, it's not worth the buy."
2.0,"Backpack is awesome! Our son loved it! ...for one week. Then, the center strap broke and now he can no longer use the backpack because, due to the size of the pack being so large, the center straps need to be clipped in  order for the pack to stay on. We would love to get a replacement strap and clip for the front, or exchange for a working model?"
2.0,"Although the material is thick and well made, this is not the same sweater as the picture advertised. I should have known better but I took a chance. It doesn‚Äôt have a vintage distressed look and the material is nothing like the picture. The colors are bright and vibrant not like pictured. Just know you aren‚Äôt getting what is shown."
2.0,Socks were very basic and I didn‚Äôt like the feel of the toe seam.
2.0,Too much padding in the chest
2.0,"These did not stay up, they kept rolling down"
2.0,Reminds me of halloween costume material. Cant wear in a professional setting. Over all disappointing.
2.0,"This shirt is proportioned differently than pictured which makes it less flattering. It's too short and it makes the sleeves look too long, in my opinion.  I kept it for bumming around. Fit was a bit small."
2.0,"Not high quality...the one I received was not very shiny, and there are some strange markings on the back of it.  Tried polishing the silver, but they won't come out.  Not really worth the money."
2.0,"Ordered 24M  for my 2 yr old grand-daughter who was still wearing 18 month clothes, and I had to give it to my 1 yr old grand-daughter because it would have been a half shirt with floods for the 2 yr old. Nice produce if the sizing was better"
2.0,Asian sizing
2.0,"Let me start off by saying that I adore most Incase products. I have their Ari Camera bag and have used their city backpack as a daily carry for two years.<br /><br />That said, though the build quality of this bag is solid, it suffers in a few key areas. It attempts to be a jack of all trades, but winds up being a master of none.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- Build quality is good.<br />- Stylish, sleek, and beautiful<br />- Outer pocket compartments has plentiful compartments for personal items/electronics/writing supplies/etc.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Exterior laptop sleeve takes up over a third of the bag. It is way oversized and takes away sacred space from the main clothes compartment. There's a lot of unnecessary space in this portion of the bag that most people would never use.<br />- Main pocket is tiny! Unless you're a woman carrying an extra pair of flats, this bag simply does not function as an overnight/weekend bag. You can fit maybe one days worth of clothes, a tiny dopple/toiletries bag, and no extra pair of shoes.<br />- Border on zipper on main pocket extends about 1 inch into the bag on all sides. This creates a weird lip that extends into the bag, making it awkward to get things in and out of.<br />- Housing for the handle takes up a significant amount of the already-tiny main compartment space.<br />- If you're buying this at MSRP ($250-$300), it's quite overpriced compared to bags of similar quality.<br />- If you wind up having to check this bag due to too little overhead bin space, there is simply not enough protection to protect any interior electronics (say goodbye to your laptop).<br /><br />In sum:<br /><br />You're better off buying a more generic carry on, and either stuffing your electronics into it, or carrying a supplemental briefcase or backpack. This bag tries hard to be both a briefcase/backpack and an overnight/weekender carry on, but it's not particularly good at either one."
2.0,The material was cheap and strange.  I returned it.
2.0,Not very good quality. Too thin.
2.0,"I expected a waffle weave style sweatshirt. Because that is what the description says. Instead,  I have a waffle weave long sleeve tshirt. It is very thin material that would be see through in a lighter color. Totally useless in cold weather. I wanted to layer this under another heavy, actual sweatshirt for barn chores. It's just too thin and oversized for that. Meanwhile,  after washing and drying this twice, there are already threads coming loose. Just poor quality."
2.0,"I really liked these at first! I used them for my nose piercings, but they consistently unscrewed themselves daily. I've tightened them with my hands and tools, but they just won't stay. Maybe it's just because I wasn't using them for my septum, but still would be an issue"
2.0,"Shirt FLADDED after first wash, and sleeve button fell off the first day I wore it. Check your buttons are secure. Ordered an extra size and glad I did, as I usually wear a XL but I sized up one.<br />Needed the extra room around the breast and waist."
2.0,Hot as balls with little to no give if you‚Äôre more than average. Not comfortable at all. Like summer in the outback hot. Like putting a wave cap on your hindquarters.
2.0,"Murimia Women's V-Neck Spaghetti Strap Backless Floral Lace Mini Skater Dress - This dress looks very cheaply made, as to be expected considering the price. I am 5'9 and ordered a medium, the length hit just a few inches above the knee, and the top part was not fitting at all. The belt ties on awkwardly and doesnt' really look like it belongs."
2.0,Returned it one arm longer than other. Too small
2.0,"I will wear these, but pro tip would be to make sure to always have a comfortable nude bra.... These are as see through as a white t shirt. They are nice and light for summer that is a good thing, and modest neckline. Not sure if they'll last through many washes though."
2.0,"They use different names, but it is the same hat that has an open panel in back. Only OK if you have thick hair on the back of your head; otherwise you will get sunburn."
2.0,Bought to use for Blue light reduction and they have absolutely no effect on that - really cute though
2.0,I love the look of this ring but it definitely is not surgical steel or gold plated. After wearing it for only a day the rose gold coloring started to come off and it left my skin green like cheap nickel plated jewelry.
2.0,poor quality  - rubbery fish - somewhat small
2.0,The buckle separated from the  velcro within a couple weeks. Tried to repair with little success. üòî
2.0,"Cute cut and fit, however material was thin and very wrinkly not worth the buy for me, returned."
2.0,This ring is beautiful but didn't last me two weeks without a stone coming out and my finger turning black/green. Extremely disappointed because it's a nice ring . Sending it back for a refund .
2.0,strap material is very thin & texture slides off the shoulders; clips for setting length often need to be repositioned.
2.0,I bought this keyring because I love the pink orchid. When this arrived it was very small and dull.  I returned it.
2.0,Battery dies constantly having to test the the time because of the second hand
2.0,Embroidery on the bill of the cap was unraveled when I opened the package
2.0,"Runs super small. Bought it twice, and was still too small. Didn't return the 1st one because it was such a hassle, and didn't buy a 3rd because I really didn't want to waste more money. Quite disappointing.  This keeps happening to me & I lose money I can't afford to simply because the return process would interrupt my life routine far too much."
2.0,Love the material and style.  Ordered a small and way too big so no option to keep it.
2.0,"Love the outfit. Fit was perfect, but when I washed it the zipper stuck and now I'm unable to wear it again...... Very disappointed because I REALLY liked this jumpsuit!! If they would have Mailed me another zipper I still would have given 5 stars .... But I couldn't even get an e-mail response....."
2.0,"The gold on these is much more yellow gold than it looks in the picture. The pink fringe is very close to what it looks like in the picture. One of the earrings arrived broken, so I will be returning these."
2.0,"there are two good things about this product: they are cheap, and they arrived on time. however, upon opening these gloves, i discovered that they appeared to be too small to fit my seven year old sister. they also felt crusty to the touch- i‚Äôm not sure what to compare the feeling of these mesh gloves to, but they felt crusted. as i walked back to my house with these gloves, i assured myself that they must be incredibly stretchy and the crust was because of humidity or something of the like. however, when i went to put them on, it was as if i were trying to put on gloves for children. i reread the name and description, and these are marketed towards women, so these gloves, because they are stretchy, should have fit me. once on, they were uncomfortable to say the least. for the long gloves, the top cut into my arm and after a few minutes it started to hurt. the thumb hole and the hole for the rest of my fingers restricted movement and felt as if it would cut off blood flow if worn for too long. the short gloves yielded the same problem with the fingers, fitting tightly around my wrist in a way that told me would hurt if worn all day. these gloves are not comfortable, nor are they worth $5.50. unless you are a child looking for gloves for your halloween costume which will be worn once then discarded, these are not for you."
2.0,"A lot smaller than I imagined, but still cute."
2.0,Way too small.  I ordered a larger size than my daughter normally wears and it was about an inch too short.
2.0,"This proctuctbis not what is pictures. The design is similar, however the fabric that the jpsuit is made from isn't real fabric. It's thing material, typically used for lining dresses. Also, the length of the pants is short. I'm 5'5, and it barely touched my amckle bone, not the floor length that the product is pictures as. Terrible waste of time."
2.0,"Quality is so so. I‚Äôm keeping it, because it‚Äôs cute"
2.0,"These are 100% not fleece lined, I got the thickest pair and they will definitely not keep my legs warm in the winter. They are just like regular tights."
2.0,The Stone
2.0,"The product looks exactly like the picture. However, the material is horrendous. I just ended up using it as a beach coverup. I‚Äôm usually a medium all around but this was huge on me. It fit more like a large. Very papery material. Would never wear it out or as a sundress."
2.0,"This jacket looks great but messes up very easily, I barely bumped into a metal shelf and it messed up my sleeve. I'm scared to wear it before the event I need it for because I don't want to mess it up any further."
2.0,* HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THESE WERE N O T !!  SUPER DARK AS ADVERTISED!!<br />*  FALSE ADVERTISING!<br />* NOT SUPER DARK - I WASTED MY MONEY !!<br />*  NEEDED FOR MEDICAL REASONS SO DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT THEY WEREN'T SUPER DARK AS ADVERTISED AND PICTURED!!
2.0,"The quality was not good for this product. For the price it is okay, but a better quality duplicate can be purchased at H&M for $5."
2.0,"We were super excited to get ours. It took a few months, probably due to demand. Our 3 year old loves the galaxy one, and my fiance prefers the skull one. I passed out yesterday because this doesn't actually let you breathe all that much... And my fiance is pretty upset that he wore his for a few days and it is already torn at the seams. Mine has threads hanging off. They're really cheap quality it seems. Do not recommend."
2.0,Quality is fine but they did not fit well at all.
2.0,I don't like the outter shell fabric and it runs really small!! Don't  recommend and wouldn't buy again!
2.0,Mehhhh.. Doesnt stay on my neck and it literally chokes. It's not pretty either.
2.0,Okay but it broke on the third use...it's disposable
2.0,I got my size per the chart and they were too hard too get on and uncomfortably tight. Once I got them on they immediately rolled down and wouldn‚Äôt stay up in the back. Perhaps I should have sized up from the size chart but if I did I‚Äôm not certain it would stop the rolling down. I‚Äôm returning.
2.0,"Very nice sweater, but runs way too small. Have tried a small & a medium, and both were way too tight."
2.0,"It's very nice and I would have loved to wear it, but it was way too small."
2.0,"If I had known that these were just pajama bottoms I never would have paid so much for them. If you're hoping for pants that looks like jeans with the comfort of pajamas, these aren't it. They're also way too loose. The drawstring doesn't do much to keep them in place. Definitely  a waste of money."
2.0,"IT's beautiful, but extremely fragile for the necklace.  Broke almost instantly.  Earrings are still hanging in there and its been quit a few months."
2.0,Item is silver not gold as depicted
2.0,"Bought this as a Christmas gift and ordered an XXL. This wouldn't fit you if you wore a Large. It is extremely small. Never gave it as the gift and there wasn't enough time to return and get another one. The top is pretty, but it's not pink. It's more of a coral color."
2.0,"Very flimsy - don't buy these to ""wear"".  These are for trying on shoes at a shoe store.  Also won't fit over about a female size 7.  I was hoping to use these to wear but every single one I have put on has ripped instantly as I was putting it on.  Plan to just drop these off at a shoe store."
2.0,"It doesn‚Äôt stretch out like the picture, it‚Äôs crooked"
2.0,"I like these glasses, they fit well. They're not as dark as I expected or is well made as I had hoped for. In fact about a week after I wrote this review originally one arm just broke unexpectedly. It had not been stressed or flexed. It completely bummed me out."
2.0,Cute mask but noticed some misspellings
2.0,Cute but leave ridges with every seam.
2.0,I'm not sure where that picture came from but this &#34;dress&#34; is no where near as cute as the photo. I believe this is another one of this situations where they got a picture from another website and then send you some wanna-be copy cat. (Also-wrinkles like you wouldn't believe!) Save your time and money! I ended up cutting it into scraps to practing sewing with lol
2.0,The adjusting metal piece digs into my back it should be turned around or the belt buckles turned around so they are not backwards for more comfort!<br />That is really my complaint till I wear more and see how they hold up!
2.0,The dress is about 5 inches too long and fits like it is a size smaller than stated. Going to goodwill.
2.0,"The bow fell completely off (which in a way helped as it does NOT match the skirt!), and the lettering peeled after he first ten minutes. disappointing as the skirt was very cute."
2.0,"These are cheaply made pants that don't fit the way yoga pants are supposed to fit. Decent quality pants smooth and contain, creating a decent looking line. These pants create no structure whatsoever, so every last contour of the body is highly visible (even with the black pants). Exceedingly unflattering. And the two front pockets? They bulge weirdly. Also very unflattering."
2.0,good but poor quality
2.0,"Cheap looking material, too stretchy, too small. It looks like I'm wearing a giant polka dot sock."
2.0,La tela es fina
2.0,I ordered in 2x -- they are not even close to that.. more like a size 10??
2.0,These are so cute.. however they are HUGE at minimum 2 sizes too big. My daughters feet are wide and she normally has to wear a size bigger but I ordered her actual size.. I will have to put toilet paper in the toes just to get her thru pictures with Santa bec I don‚Äôt have time to wait for another pair to come in. Disappointed
2.0,THese are a beauitful pair of earrings I am not going to lie but I am super senisitve to costume jewelery. This is not the seller's fault- I should have known that infact is costume jewlery and that I am sensitive to the metal. It hurts my ears. :( too bad maybe studs would have been better to be honest- w the exact same color. Friends asked me if I am trying to admit native american vibes and I said yes I am! haha :0<br /><br />Highly reccomended if you are not sensitive to costume jewlery otherwise be careful!
2.0,Shirt was way to small and it hurt so much on so never buy again
2.0,the fabric is weird.
2.0,"After about 2 months the handles, where the attach to the bag, ripped the bag and fell off."
2.0,"Purchased the two-pack. Upon my first use of one of the packs earlier this week, the zipper broke. Tomorrow, I fly out again, so I'll be using the second bag. Hopefully, it'll hold up.<br /><br />I registered my warranty online at the C+F website, and contacted the company about receiving a replacement. I'll update my review if/when that happens.<br /><br />Sure, it's just an under-$20 product, but still, it shouldn't break on your first use."
2.0,Not very comfortable. The spider is bigger than it looks in the picture. Took a long time to arrive.
2.0,"If you are looking for the actual large Alice pack, don't buy this. Its not a large. Its a medium. I should know, I've rucked  for years with one.<br /><br />Asides from the false advertising, its an okay rucksack. The stitching seems sturdy enough, the straps stay cinched when carrying 35ish pounds. The frame actually looks and feels really nice. The shoulder straps are kind of odd in that one has a button clasp so that you can drop the ruck quickly, but the other strap doesn't, so one arm is free, but you have to weasel the other arm out. The paint on the frame arrived chipped, so it's going to spread and rust in that spot eventually. The drawstring cinch at the top of the bag is made of cheap plastic and WILL break eventually. The material feels sturdy, and is comparable to the molle ruck that I have.<br />Overall, its just a confusing rucksack. Its very clearly Chinese-made, but it looks like they spent another 10 minutes putting a little bit of quality into it. Depending on how often you use it, it might last years, or it might last a few months. I ruck about once or twice a week, and I do weighted conditioning another three or four days a week, and if this lasted me a year before having a critical failure, I'd be surprised. Definitely returning this immediately, not worth $100. If it was $50 or $60, I'd keep it, but not $100."
2.0,"I ordered these masks to use in a video. The silver one gave me problems. The clasp is TEENSY. I have baby fingers and still had trouble. Plus, the chain broke midway. Luckily, I have a small head and it still fastened. If I had had a huge pot roast head, I would have been out of luck. Overall for the price, you can afford to take a chance."
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt fit the way I expected just because of the fabric. The fabric is not good.
2.0,It‚Äôs a beautiful case but after using it for barely a week the lining is coming apart. I‚Äôm going to see about gluing it down but I really shouldn‚Äôt have to at this point.
2.0,Too thick and I din‚Äôt like the quality. Colors are darker than what the picture shows. I just liked the gripper.
2.0,Smaller than size description
2.0,"Ordered size XXS based on the size chart, it was too big."
2.0,The fit of the blouse is fine. However the quality is shoddy.  The edges on the ruffles is raw (not sewn) and the material is very slinky/sleezy feeling.  I am using it as a pajama top for some extra bottoms I had.  I wouldn't be caught dead wearing this outside. The &#34;necklace&#34; that came with it went into the trash.  It was broken on arrival and looked like something a three year old would wear for dress-up.
2.0,I expected it to be bigger
2.0,"The only thing I like about this band is the price... The color of the brown band is not like in the picture, it is somewhat lighter. Plus the hand itself seems a bit flimsy... Not what I expected."
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt what I expected. I think it has one line in the whole shirt where it‚Äôs been sewn!! It for good but I‚Äôm just not in love with it.
2.0,I expected to bracelet to stretch.
2.0,Love the color. Love the feel. Fit amazing up until the belly button area. I thought this would be cut a tad more flowy but it seems very narrow right down the legs. I am short ... 34 DDD hourglass so large in the butt and hips 44&#34; . It didn't compliment that at all. So sad because I love everything else about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: super bummed out that it did not wash well at all. Gentle/cold cycle and it has little fuzzy rough spots aroud the elastic waist band. It also snagged both times I wore it in the chest area. 2 stars because it looked great for the one night I really needed it!
2.0,Stretched out way too fast
2.0,It doesn't sit naturally around the neck
2.0,The holes for the pins are too small. I cannot use this at all.
2.0,"Looked neat, but doesn't really work.  Items don't stay put.  Its just awkward"
2.0,"Nice pants, light weight and comfortable. But the belt stinks. The locking system slips loose easily."
2.0,"I opened the package and immediately realized the material is not what I wanted.  This is not the &#34;Humphrey Bogart&#34; coat.  It looks like polyester and feels like it too.  It also is bright white and is not the elegant look I desired.  I will read the description more carefully in the future, especially because I shy away from man-made materials as much as possible."
2.0,First time wearing it and it has a little hole in it.  So sad but noticed it after I put it on and got on an airplane.  It is cute and comfy though.
2.0,Too clunky. Not easily adjustable and does not fit comfortably on any of the fingers. Up close it looks more like a rat then a cat.
2.0,its ok.  color runs.  quality is just ok.
2.0,Don't like how the airfilter came out and I couldn't put it back in so I had to throw it away. After I get my other ones I won't order any more like these. So very disappointed with the quality of the masks
2.0,"Proportions wrong. Very long and thin. Is not even close to fitting a normal adult.  Loved the color, but will not be able to wear it."
2.0,"These rings had potential, and I really wanted to love them, but they were disappointing. They look cheap, but you get what you pay for ... The &#34;black&#34; enamel ring is a navy. I do like the colors, but the rings are incredibly uncomfortable and run small. Weird. My finger is a 7.5 and I ordered an 8 to adjust for the stacking of rings ... like other buyers, even wearing one or two rings wasn't comfortable at all. Returning them."
2.0,"I used this yoga pants for walking.  After just three weeks, the pants is very worn out around the butt area.  Please see attached picture.  Definitely not worth $20."
2.0,Cute and well made but writing is very hard to read. Did not keep them.
2.0,They didn't look like I thought they would from the picture. They do seem relatively sturdy however co later to other fashion eye glasses.
2.0,I would really only consider this jacket as a rain jacket if there‚Äôs a slight possibility for light rain. It‚Äôs like an unlined windbreaker. Not waterproof-more like water repellent. Rain does not bead up or roll off - it kind of absorbs into the fabric. Back seam is not double-seamed or ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù seamed so rain can get through. Cords in hood and around bottom of jacket are cotton rope which soak up and hold wetness-should be made of nylon cord so that doesn‚Äôt happen. I like the army green color and the overall style.
2.0,The product was perfect until the diamonds fell out
2.0,"Brand new pair of shoes wore out in less than 15 days of use. Just regular commute to work, nothing much."
2.0,Got a lot of duplicates in my order. Decent quality for the actual studs though.
2.0,"Not the color it shows, more of a green blue. Also insanely see through. Does not block anything!"
2.0,Looks really nice for the price but it's a little uncomfortable in the front
2.0,"Not as strong as I would have hoped. I have a feeling it will break very soon. I don‚Äôt think it was worth the money but I guess if it‚Äôs a ring you only wear going out that‚Äôs different. I wanted a ring I could just leave on all the time, but it gets caught in everything and very fragile seeming. I kind of regret buying it."
2.0,"I like the size and the final look of the beads when they are interlocked.  Problem is most of the beads would not interlock.  I got 3 bags to use as a twirly for my special needs daughter and she likes them, but<br />for the cost,  with one bag I got a good length necklace, but the next bag almost half of them would not<br />interlock, this makes it a very expensive item for as many of we use.  I think the beads should come already interlocked, that way you would know that they will all work, instead of ending up with 1/3 to 1/2  bag that does not interlock and also, they will not interlock with the other beads that are not interlocking.  if anyone know of a way to get all the beads to work, please let me know. I remember playing with POP Beads when I was young and don't remember having any problem with them interlocking."
2.0,"The color was supposed to be white but was definitely off white, slight purple tint, doesn't flow or look like picture. Somewhat large. Going to return it"
2.0,"They‚Äôre really nice quality, not too heavy, and they‚Äôre not long or stuck out super far, I just wish I was sent the right ones. I ordered 6gauge but got 2 gauge and can‚Äôt fit em in if I tried. Bummer"
2.0,"Is a cute suit but back is thin and so are bottoms, can see buttcrack and tags through it. Also slightly small. Typically wears a 12-14, went with 12, shouldve bought a 14."
2.0,"Saddened that it fits and is beautiful , but much shorter than pictured on a model.  Also I made the personal mistake of not checking that it was lined.<br />Not a take top lined so I cannot cut out."
2.0,"I liked the color of this dress, the material was pretty thin though ... I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 135  lbs and a small was huge on me."
2.0,The material is not smooth or buttery like many others available. Runs really smal. Not flattering. I decided to return.
2.0,"I used this pair of sunglasses once on a 3/4 day chartered boat saltwater fishing trip.  At the end of the trip, film from the lense started to peels off. Polarized lenses works, however, it only lasted for one trip."
2.0,I thought for the price this would have been a much better helmet. Very cheap & flimsy.
2.0,"the watch is beautiful.. but is smaller than in the picture, much more."
2.0,"I love the look of these, but today half of one of the clusters fell off! I am so disappointed!"
2.0,Horrible material. Horrible fit. Horrible design. I gave it away
2.0,feels like an iron on
2.0,"The sleeves do not fit like the Picture.  The sleeves could be made better,  without looking like Liberace!"
2.0,These are nice but surprisingly small when my son put them on it looked like they were glasses for children. My son is 19 years old.
2.0,Fit ok.but material cheep
2.0,It a Beautiful hand for toddler my daughter loves it
2.0,I ordered XL and they are more like X S. Sending them back.
2.0,"Eventhough the price of this beanie was high, I really like the color on Amazon. But after getting the product, the color was not that attractive as it is in the picture and the beanie itself is average. This is not a go to buy product for that price. Because of the Covid19 problems, I don't want to return a product I purchased, just in case, that I don't want somebody to get the germs from me. But this seller has wrong pictures. Be careful with this purchase unless you have money to throw away."
2.0,Fits the watch decent for a replacement. However the quality of the band is pretty poor. It is verrry stiff compared to the original fitbit band. It acutally marks my hand (since you need to wear the fit bit  snug) . the look is a bit shinier than the matte finish of the original fitbit version.<br /> I wont buy this again.
2.0,The clasp on one of the earrings broke after only 1 day. They are smaller than expected. Almost small enough for a toddler to wear. Not appropriate for an adult.
2.0,"Fits good, does what it promises reminding you to keep your shoulders back, it's actually very comfortable but what really upsets me is that it smells really bad under the arms after a single use. It says in the description that this product has some kind of treatment to avoid smell but I don't see that. All my shirts, T-shirts and jackets, none of them smell after use, but this one does. For 90 bucks I would expect it not to."
2.0,I like these because they‚Äôre stretchy and have pockets. But they‚Äôre too big on me and too short and they seem to get baggier as the day goes on.
2.0,This skirt is gorgeous but poor quality. The material tore at the seam the second time I wore it.
2.0,"I was seriously disappointed in the fit.  I used the size chart provided by Amazon to make the size selection.  There is little support, and I was glad that I didn't pay full retail for this."
2.0,I was expecting this hat to be soft on the inside. It's rough and scratchy. The outside is nice and plush.
2.0,"Straps were too long so the dress hung far down, and the dress‚Äôs skirt was cut in pieces which was unexpected"
2.0,Cute sandle but how it fastens isn't. It keeps slipping and comes undone.
2.0,"Nice safety glasses but let‚Äôs be clear.  These ‚Äúsafety glasses‚Äù<br />-have no Z87 rating,<br />-are described as polarized lenses but are NOT polarized,<br />-I ordered the grey with clear lens and received the pink/red with clear lens (as others have reported),<br />-do NOT fit over my eyeglasses (but I have large eyeglasses) as the other safety glasses I have purchased previously (Gateway Safety 6980 Cover2).  I have purchased over 6 pairs of the Gateway‚Äôs but I would not recommend the RIVBAO glasses.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Get the Gateways and skip these."
2.0,"The elastic on this is very weak, it practically tore the moment I put it on. The fit is insanely huge- if you don't pay attention, it will fall down in front. Overall, you get what you pay for. I liked the idea, but the reality is that it is another item which will become useless."
2.0,The picture looks better than the actual.  Product was actually kind of cheap looking and I haven't worn it to this day.
2.0,Was disappointed one of the glasses came damaged.
2.0,They are short so they fall out a lot. Also it seems they are not the right gauge compare to others I have
2.0,The material isn‚Äôt great. I‚Äôm sure after a few washes it will be sand paper. There is no hold in the top. It‚Äôs like they cut a rectangle and stitched two strings to it. If it wasn‚Äôt for the straps the top would just slide down. The shorts are what saves the outfit.
2.0,This dress runs really small
2.0,These fit weird. The are short and narrow.
2.0,Dress was way too large. Reordered as a small and fit fine.
2.0,Rough material .
2.0,"i was expecting small, so I ordered 2 of them the chain is very cheap and the camera was large enough for a key chain. as the old saying goes u get what u pay for"
2.0,"I was really excited to get this but my enthusiasm was quickly dashed.  The top compartments have already started ripping and I've had it less than a week.  I also only have two lipsticks in the compartment so it's not overflowing or anything.  The compartments are also too narrow for MAC compact foundation. Overall, I wish I'd chosen something else."
2.0,"If you have boobs, I don't suggest. And it made cheap."
2.0,"Sorry to say but these sunglasses are super weak and will not hold up.  Every time I even try to put them on my face, they bend out of shape and nearly break. The frames have a nice shape but I can't even wear them.  They are going in my dress up/Halloween box for one time wear."
2.0,This is a good lock and works as advertised but the t-bar extension that is supposed to be included was not in the package or the box.
2.0,"Cute hat, but I ordered rose red. It is NOT red. It is more of a hot pink, not what I wanted. Sending it back!"
2.0,I should have read the reviews.  Material is not what you think it is!
2.0,"Product was delivered July 23. I put the earring back on that same day. The first earring came out of my ear and was lost July 31 (I never even felt it go). I scratched my earlobe and another earring fell out on August 2. I caught that one and was able to put that earring back in. I don‚Äôt have a matching pair of earrings anymore, so I‚Äôm not sure it actually matters.<br /><br />Fortunately I tried these earring backs out on a pair of consignment store earrings that only cost $8 rather than any family heirlooms."
2.0,"The glasses are well built, but they are a little on the heavy side and they are not as dark as they look in this picture. Medium dark at the top and gets lighter towards the bottom.  Will buy another pair ONLY if they are entirely dark."
2.0,"I was sure to order the right size, and these were extremely hard to put on. After struggling to put them on, both sides of my foot were immediately smashed. Length wise the shoes were okay but they seem to be shaped weird because my feet immediately hurt when I put them on. They seem light and cheaply made, and they look like clunky rain boots."
2.0,I wish I‚Äôd read the reviews before so I wouldn‚Äôt waste time. I ordered size M but it‚Äôs really way smaller more like XS but long. Didn‚Äôt sit well at all. Returned.
2.0,"Overall I was disappointed. It looks light and flowy but is actually quite thick. The high neck line is uncomfortable and the dress is definitely not made for short ladies (I'm 5'3). In the photo it appears to be above the knee but mine was way longer, totally covering my knees. Looked like a grandma mumu dress rather than a fun flirty summer dress. I bought it for my bachelorette weekend at the beach, and needless to say, I did NOT wear it."
2.0,"It looked really pretty and cute when i got it, but it broke easy and didn't last long which was a bummer. I won't buy another one because the wings will just come off of it again."
2.0,"This shirt was not as vibrant as in the picture. It was shorter and tighter than expected, and I sized up."
2.0,"These are cheaply made sunglasses that do not fit well.  Thankfully, I didn't pay much for them.  Not worth returning, I gave them to my one year old to play with."
2.0,This product had a flaw where some of the gauge stuck out and could actually cut your ear. QC apparently isn‚Äôt high on their list üò©
2.0,Pockets are bulky and accordion like way too big for my liking.
2.0,Looks frumpy and hard to tell cheap quality of fabric in picture. Does not look as nice in person as picture.
2.0,"Giving it two starts, it‚Äôs beautiful and fits well, but it arrived dirty (make-up stains) and broken in the back and the tags fell off. Returning it for another one."
2.0,"I wear this to a festival, it fit the occasion and fitting itself was not bad.  The problem I had was, I washed once and the zipper part pulled out.  It needs to be stitched up, this was after ONE wash!  I would say if you're desperate and need an outfit for a function, this is doable for the price.  However, it doesn't last long after washing."
2.0,I ordered a size medium and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 130 lbs... I am hourglass shaped with 34C  to give an idea of how it fit. It was barely loose where it needed to be. The fabric is so thick it holds a weird shape and doesn‚Äôt just naturally hang like it should. It says it‚Äôs 85% cotton but the outside layer doesn‚Äôt even look cotton at all and like spandex instead. I had reddish pink stains on the back collar area. I‚Äôm not happy about this purchase at all.
2.0,I am a size 6 pants and these are so small on me! I do have a bigger rear end but still. It was like I was wearing an x-small. Not a fan but they are sexy!
2.0,I wear this watch every single day and it loses 5mins every month. Also while I don't expect it to be real gold I have had Orient gold plating last years before fading. Will not buy this again. Maybe the silver/stainless steel.
2.0,"Earrings are pretty, but are all the same color. Picture showed the earrings in two different colors."
2.0,Look good! Clasp is not...lost on the second time I wore them.
2.0,"This tie clip, I like it. But its side is not smooth enough, it is easy to wear and damage the tie."
2.0,"the bodice laces up, but the thread grommets that hold the laces, come undone and pull out of the sewing.  you need a long torso to make this work. not for short girls, the bodice doesn't lay right."
2.0,"Seriously just read them.  I saw how many people gave this product a five out of five star review and I watched a few videos.  I was sold.  I have been buying $10 sunglasses from wherever I happen to be when I need sunglasses for half my life and I got tired of my sunglasses breaking after a few months because of the lack of quality. I decided to fix this issue once and for all by buying sunglasses that cost twice as much as the ones I normally buy ($20 for those of you who hate math) This purchase was a mistake.  LET ME BE CLEAR!  these glasses have not broken or malfunctioned in any way.  I do not hate them, they are actually quite functional and comfortable.  However, I know 10 dollar quality when I see it and these Duduma Polarized Sports Sunglasses are NOT worth the TWENTY DOLLARS I spent on them!  If a company has to GIVE THEIR PRODUCT AWAY to get good reviews than their product can't possibly be worth the pricetag they are asking.  This is just my opinion out of all the other opinions but take it from me, these sunglasses are worth less than 10 dollars and Duduma is giving them away to half the reviewers and giving the other half 50% off the price.  Of course they are going to give it a good review.  THEY DIDN'T PAY FULL PRICE like I did.  I WOULD NOT have paid 20 dollars for these if I had tried them on in a store."
2.0,Do not buy unless you are 5'10&#34; or taller. I am 5'6&#34; and wearing this just below my bust and over my pregnant belly it still dragged the ground by a solid 3-4 inches. The construction and weight of the skirt otherwise is great it's just a poor length for average height folks.
2.0,"The face falls out pretty easily. The band is a little big for younger kids. They really should put numbers on the face,"
2.0,"When it worked, it was great.  Best belt I've ever had.<br /><br />The teeth that hold the buckle portion onto the strap kept coming loose, digging divots into the leather, until it would no longer stay closed.  While it functioned, it was great, but now I'm left with a belt I've had to cut shorter and shorter, and I can't seem to find anywhere to buy just a replacement strap.  Was hoping it'd last longer than the normal department store belts, but only got about 7 months out of it."
2.0,"They are short. I am 5'10&#34; and even after taking out the hem, they are about an inch and a half short."
2.0,"Sizing is incorrect for this product.  If Asian countries want to be in the American market, they need to use  an<br />American Size equivalent. Disappointed,"
2.0,It says it was a men‚Äôs shirt so I got small but it was more like a woman‚Äôs small. Very tight.
2.0,The necklace looks like paperclips put together. The Mama part is good. Probably will make it an anklet since the chain is not very nice.
2.0,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and it is at least 3‚Äù long for me. I generally wear a small size and I think this is at minimum a size medium. It is not true to size. I got it for a trip so I didn‚Äôt have a chance to return it. And to be fare, it kept me warm."
2.0,"The material is extremely thin. Only one pair has pockets. I bought the cropped leggings, and they go down to my ankles. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù."
2.0,Perfect except for the fit.  Too large and I don't have a small head.
2.0,"It broke. Like it literally BROKE. The handles fell off, the hinge clasps on the shoulder strap just completely busted..<br />The bag itself is in perfect condition. But the shape is really wierd. I really liked the fact that I could stick my laptop in there without having to put up a fight, but now since the straps are gone... well.. it's basically useless.."
2.0,"Cheap hoodie, bad graphic!"
2.0,"2 stars because it is white, it is a robe, and it does have feathers. fits usa women's dress size 8 and smaller. i'm 5'7', length is above ankle. no closure. is moderately opaque. will need serious steaming (cannot iron material) as it has deep, firm wrinkles. all of this could be tolerated if not for the fact that this looks nothing like the picture with regard to fullness. fullness is one of those thin starter boas. unfortunately i needed a white one for a stage thinggy so it will have to do. as a rule you can't trust forum novelties products to be anything more than kids' dress up items. probs should have guessed this would be the same."
2.0,"It looks just as advertised, but it was shipped to me completely flattened out. It looks pretty dumb and I can't get the wrinkles to come out of the dome. Works as a work hat though"
2.0,Thin material and if didn‚Äôt fit my breast. I would have had to have it altered
2.0,It runs small. Buy a size larger :(
2.0,"the chain is tangled and does not look like the photo, I put it on my niece and the same thing happened, she has to untangle it and in reality my question is this Pandora product original?<br />la cadena est√° enredada y no  luce como la foto, se la puse a mi sobrina y sucedi√≥ lo mismo, ella tiene que desenredarla y en realidad mi pregunta es este producto original de Pandora."
2.0,These were great for my son until I realized that they come off every time he took his face shield off. He lost them on the second day. They were comfortable though.
2.0,I did not like this item. Not enough pockets inside.
2.0,This ring is very dark with little sparkle.  Not a winner...
2.0,it's smaller than XL
2.0,"I like the material, it is wellmade, but for some reason it did not cover the whole shin"
2.0,"I ordered two of these necklaces for my two sons - 10 and 8.  They have been looking for a braided necklace to replace the one they had a few years ago and lost.  We received the package very timely and before the expected arrival date.  However, my son wore it for less than 4 hours and the glue frayed at the clasp and broke before he could even get home from school.  The one we bought years ago from 5 and Below (they don't carry anymore) lasted years - I can't imagine why this one couldn't do the same.  The quality was very poor - and I would say you get what you pay for - but we paid the same for the one from 5 and Below but that one was fine.  Tried to return for a replacement (bought last week) and it said it wasn't eligible for return.  I contacted Amazon but not sure what they will do."
2.0,I don‚Äôt think this tunic is flattering at all. I do like the color and feel of the material. I bought my usual size but don‚Äôt think sizing up or down would help. Very disappointed.
2.0,"I can‚Äôt speak for the other designs but I want to give a heads up to any other peeps with sensitive skin that the cardigan sweater is very itchy. I think it would be fine if you were wearing long sleeves underneath but I‚Äôm a Florida girl so I had to return. Sizing, color, and design were all good."
2.0,Why smaller then I need. Size one down if you buy.
2.0,The vest was not leather but a blend.<br />It was not what I wanted. It had a shiny type look.
2.0,Dry clean only. Each order is shipped from a different manufacturer so you never know if you‚Äôre going to get the one that fits right or the one if it‚Äôs way too small.
2.0,Nice light sports bra but only after a handful of uses zipper broke clean off.
2.0,"Fabric very scratchy, more stiff than expected.  Wanted it to be more soft & flowy.  I returned it because of this."
2.0,The fabric is not regular swim suit fabric. It's way smaller than expected and it's more a neon purple than the deep purple in the picture. There is a reason it is so cheap! Buyer beware
2.0,Pants are definitely xl in the length but not the pants. I am 5'9&#34; and they drag on the floor .
2.0,I thought it was going to be larger. It's more medium. Otherwise it ok. Really disappointed
2.0,"I was a bit disappointed in this jumpsuit because I really wanted it to work out.  But it fit a little weird in the crotch area, and the material wasn't as I expected.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice jumpsuit, but in my opinion it was just poorly made because I ordered according to the size chart, and it didn't fit like a medium should. I'm a size 8 and 155lbs. I couldn't even bring myself to take a pic in it.:(...overall, it just wasn't for me."
2.0,"I was surprised when I got the wrist keychain.  The rings were in a separate bag, therefore‚Ä¶I went and got the teenager Nextdoor to put the wrings on."
2.0,Way 2 short. Im 5'8&#34; and it came to just the bottom of my bottom. This is only for shorter women
2.0,"Jewelry is mis-sized. I've ordered both 5/16&#34; and 3/8&#34; and the delivered pieces were identical. The beads are 2mm, not 3mm.<br />This makes me wonder what else is not accurate about these. Are they truly 316L? Who knows. If they can't get sizing right, they can't be trusted for anything else."
2.0,Not true to size. I normally wear a small. I could not zip the dress up. The material has no stretch. Material felt cheap.
2.0,COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COLOR. I ordered the Foxglove (light pink) and I received a more mauve/ purplish pair. Was really exited for the light pink as it‚Äôs my favorite color and I had been looking for a pair for a while now. Disappointed but still comfortable to wear around the house.
2.0,Pretty shirt but very long
2.0,"The color doesn't match the picture at all. I was expecting a bright fuchsia, but instead it was a pastel blush. The fit wasn't fantastic, either. Overall it was unflattering."
2.0,"I love everything about these leggings, except, the pattern is upside down. The leggings pictured in the ad are correct, mine are not."
2.0,broke after 1 use
2.0,"There were no issues with the quality, however the sizing was incorrect. It was supposed to have been for a 7 year-old boy, but was actually too big for his 14 year-old sister."
2.0,"If you adore back fat, GET THIS SUIT. Accentuates your fatty bits so well! Loved the color but this went back as I prefer to accentuate my fat belly instead."
2.0,Is a cheapish iron on style graphic. Fabric of the shirt is nice. But the graphic is cheap. STICKS TOGETHER WHEN WASHED.
2.0,"First of all, I ordered the grey socks, and I received purple. Luckily, I like purple enough to keep them. Secondly, they are huge! I'm hoping a few times in the dryer will shrink them up some. Keep in mind though, I do have very thin legs.. I'm 5'6 and about 110lbs."
2.0,This product came with stains from glue or something on the bottom
2.0,Way too long and I didn‚Äôt like the material. Seemed cheap.
2.0,"Colors are not as bright as in picture. The turtle is blurry, and is bigger than expected. It‚Äôs more like a house dress."
2.0,Thay are pretty nice but I dident receive gold. Unless thats there excuss for gold. Other than that the nose piece dident fit really well. Thay fell to low on my face had to make adjustments. Would not buy this brand again.
2.0,Ordered the size recommended by measurement -- way too small should have sized up. Lightweight is right - hardly t-shirt in thickness.
2.0,"Don't buy it! For the price, it's so not worth it.  Very poor quality material.  Sizing was accurate and animation was clear, but the fabric quality looks and feels cheap."
2.0,"I was sooooo excited to get this kurti. I is too small. A very snug fit and if I wore it the kurti would rip. I normally where a 1x to 2x but I got a 3x. Buy a size bigger! Sadly, I bought the largest size they offer and I can not do that."
2.0,I bought the wrong size and is unwearable
2.0,"Could immediately tell the straps would give me blisters. Too short, too. Returned."
2.0,"Really beautiful earrings. Love the look, but I don't think they are truly 18K gold plated because they caused inflammation, itching and redness of my ear almost immediately and I had to remove them asap. These pictures show before I put the earrings on, and the redness and swelling after I removed them. Overall, nice looking earrings, but if you are looking for gold plated because of allergies, stay away!"
2.0,"To fine, could break easy"
2.0,It ok but need to be less bulky
2.0,Disappointed in this purchase. The pair I received are more sand color and not cognac.
2.0,Material was cheap!
2.0,I purchased a large and it was too small so I returned and ordered an XL. This one fit but came with a black stain across the collar. With this being the second try with this dress I‚Äôm not sure if I want to return and try to order again or just return it entirely. Not entirely thrilled with the quality for $.
2.0,"The case I received is slightly different from the pictures. The camera, mic, and flash have their own cut out and not a big shared one - which is what I preferred. They aren't precise either. The clear sides look dirty. And it's stretched out a little on one corner of the phone so it doesn't fit snug. But I do like the marble look on the back, it's the same as the pictures."
2.0,"I love it but you can see-through too much, in my opinion...."
2.0,"Up close & personal, it was too small. The material was less desirable & the color seemed faded dull."
2.0,"too small for my arms. Can't imagine they would fit anyone except a small woman even with the stretch in them.  When I pull them up, they just roll back down, so the upper part of my arms do not stay covered and protected from the sun when I drive."
2.0,Did not fit. I had to give it to my young niece
2.0,The quality of the chain didn't seem to meet that which was displayed in the photo. Not bad at all for the price though.
2.0,I purchased this bag on 6/5 to use for vacation and by the second day my straps were unraveling. Did not have anything super heavy in the bag. Super disappointed that it did not hold up. It‚Äôs a super cute bag though. Maybe mine was just defective not sure.
2.0,The writeup said 95% cotton.  It is not.<br />It's 95% Rayon
2.0,When I saw the pictures I thought it would have at least some weight to it. Looks good in the picture but in real it‚Äôs very light weight and looks cheap and doesn‚Äôt really look like the photos. Feels like plastic too. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
2.0,"These are very warm. However, they are enormous. My fingers don't even reach the finger holes. I guess they will just be mittens."
2.0,Love the outfit but to small
2.0,It‚Äôs a gift to my husband who says it didn‚Äôt work at all. Poor quality . For the price it could be better . It‚Äôs just a yellow tinted glass .
2.0,The fit is good. Pattern is nice. Unfortunately it is see-through. Will be returning.
2.0,"The style and material were great, but the size was definitely too small."
2.0,Cheap looking . Returned
2.0,Very cheap material; not satisfied with this purchase.
2.0,"I wanted it to be blue... description and pictures suggested it was blue, but it was all very Turquoise and it was also very tangled up!"
2.0,Looks much smaller in person disappointed about size.
2.0,Great quality but very difficult to take off. Recommend buying one with a zipper.
2.0,1) I was sent the wrong color<br />2) Smells awful
2.0,was disappointed but when VERY GREATFUL AND THANKFUL that I was reimbursed.  I will order more jewelry from them because they truly value their customers.
2.0,"As noted in other posts, these boots run at least a half size, full size or more too small. Definitely size up. Also, again as noted in previous posts these boots need to be worn quite a bit before they're comfortable."
2.0,Worn and washed 3 times and it's fraying at the stitching  and edges.
2.0,Very small. Made for petite person with small cheat
2.0,"Not for anyone in the Itty bitty titty committee. I was hoping these wouldn't smash my boobs and make me look like a boy, which is what the no padding ones do. Instead my boobs now look like they are way too far to watch side. The padding is very close to my armpits. If you don't have heavy boobs to pull the padding towards the middle where the girls should go then don't buy."
2.0,"The strap material is excellent, great flexibility, stability, and texture. The fit is pretty much perfect as well. However, the metal clasp is a coated metal, not sure what kind of metal but certainly not stainless steel, and the underside of it (the part that touches your skin) is very rough and almost seems unfinished or at the very least unpolished. I've never had a metal allergy so I can only assume my abrasions are from this rough texture. At first I thought maybe I got a mosquito bite right where the clasp happened to be located but this abrasion never got better for several weeks and only healed after I switched straps to another brand with a polished stainless steel clasp. It's a shame because other than that I really liked this strap. So this is something to be aware of. In order for all the health sensors on a smart watch to work you need to wear it fairly tight. And for what it's worth, my wife uses the same strap and she hasn't had any issues with it at all. I might switch back after a while and see if I experience the same issue but I'm fairly certain it's the texture of this clasp that caused it. I'm tempted to take a Dremel to it and try to buff it out."
2.0,"This runs a little big I normally wear a size medium but this was to loose. The strings at the back of the top make it adjustable however the bottom isnt adjustable. If this garment had tummy control it would have a tighter stretch at the stomach which would b the mesh portion. Its just a regular 2pc bathing suit which is why I gave it 2 stars. The quality is good but I got this b/c I have a little gut and hoped the ""tummy control"" would do it for me. Also I have a bit of a short torso/short waisted and i wear high waisted pants but this bottom is too high the small would have been better in that aspect, but I think if I would have gotten a small it would have been tighter but not tummy control tight bcuz that would smooth out the stomach and nothing about this has any of the real tummy control qualities. So buy only if you like the style it is a cute high waisted 2pc bathing suit."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this bag. It has a good look that I like but it fails for practical use. First and foremost of the fails is the shape itself. It is a big bag and it hangs on your back just like a big grocery bag, doesn't hold a shape and has no structure. Also I never really trusted anything valuable in the outer pockets due to the magnetic strap system. while it would detract from the look I would really like to see zippers to secure items. The first time I used it was while traveling through Europe on the trains. The straps do not hold position and constantly slip requiring readjustment. My wife took it with us on a recent beach vacation to Mexico. She found it to be a bottomless pit that she could not find her items in and because of the weight of the bag itself did not like it either."
2.0,The pendant is beautiful. The chain broke easily after 3 months.
2.0,Very loud ticking. Face is not as blue as images led me to believe.
2.0,Lettering fell off in bag
2.0,"Crooked, big and the shape is not great."
2.0,"I like the dress, but it is about two sizes below the stated measurements."
2.0,Its very pretty and I'm happy that I bought these earring except I thought that the earrings would be more darker than the ones that I got.
2.0,I had to return this dress it was about a foot too long an the fit was a little big thru the shoulders.<br />Other than that it was a pretty dress.
2.0,I bought 3 different brands of compression stocks. They all looked similar in style but these were the worst. They run a little shorter in length than the others.
2.0,Pants are way too small. The top is just right.
2.0,"The costume says ""one size fits most"" and I am a size 6 (woman) and it was way too small for me. It was cute though."
2.0,These are huge!!!!  Waist band came to my breasts.  Legs fit like harem pants.  Hung 19‚Äù from my feet.
2.0,Came all squished and folded :(
2.0,I bought XL. I didn't know they were EU XL and US L do they are far too small! The fabric is nice and stretchy but I had to give them to my daughter.
2.0,"I‚Äôm giving 2 stars because the customer service was very good. Unfortunately, this bra is very tight and uncomfortable... maybe not so if you are very thin. The cups are also very large and pronounced. But as for the return and refund process, 5 stars. For reference, I am a bra size 36A, 160 lbs."
2.0,Not very strong two times have already tore off. I would save your money.
2.0,"I'm normally a 18/20 and this 2XL dress is too small and very tight -- has none of the flow of the item picture. It also tries to keep creeping up in the back and get all breezy on the backside. As for the material, it is very thin and it ever so slightly scratchy... If it fit better and wasn't so tight I could probably get past how itchy it is, but since it is basically saran wrapped to my body, issa no from me. Will be returning this."
2.0,Cute dress but super right across the chest.
2.0,way too thin and ends are not even finished.
2.0,The hat is cute but I should‚Äôve listened to other reviews. The second I took the hat out of the packaging the little purple squares started falling off. I decided to return it.
2.0,The skirt hit as pictured and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9. My issue was the fabric felt cheap and was very clingy. I had to return because it made me look bigger than I was.
2.0,"This dress doesn't lay flat on your abdomen. It's all rumply in a messy-looking way. I'm 5'5"" and the small hit below the knee, looking wierd. I was so excited to get this but it just doesn't work."
2.0,"Item received was nothing like the picture, the fabric was very thin. I think if you are very small & have no bumps/bulges/love handles or fat this perfect for you. The concept was a great idea - the execution not so much. I would not recommend this product unless your looking for a very thin fabric jumpsuit , also it had a ton of loose strings all over the garment! I returned it ASAP!"
2.0,"I should have taken more time to thoroughly read the reviews. These leggings are soft (LuLaRoe material) but incredibly sheer. The tag is visible in the back, not to mention my unmentionables. They also don't suck in my chub and smooth things out as I was hoping. Pockets are great though!"
2.0,I like the item it very very pretty but the construction ... I dropped it a short distance and the 3 of the stones fell off!
2.0,Se borr√≥ muy r√°pido el escrito y cambio color no me dur√≥ mucho
2.0,did not like i figured if it was an oversized design that the sleeves would be big too but they were too short and too tight and i did not like the material it was uncomfortable and feels super cheap
2.0,Stitching came out of a couple of pockets.
2.0,Kinda on the small side go a size bigger
2.0,"Fabric seems to be well made. Looks average, not cheap, but also not high end looking. The pocket on the outside back is shallow, and seems to be good for holding a slim pack of gum or some tickets. The front outside pocket is large enough to carry a passport. The front pocket under the flap doesn't have a zipper or snap, so I rarely used it. The biggest two problems with the bag are the main compartment pockets and dividers, plus the velcro securement. The inside dividers are essentially useless. To me, there is so much fabric used inside that it's awkward to reach in and grab an item. I think it would have been much better without the flimsy fabric dividers. Next, the velcro securement is weak. Unless you press the two pieces of velcro together just perfectly, the flap will not stay in place."
2.0,Much shorter than the photo.
2.0,Pants fit ok but top is small.  I ordered a 3 x  to compensate for size differences and shrinkage and am glad I did.<br />I am  xl to 2xl depending on cut of the top and this top is cut very small.  Size up ladies especially if you have a fuller bust.  I hope they don't shrink. Also material is a little thin.  They are cute and I live in this type PJs.
2.0,At first it well but be aware when you buy this dress wash in cold water and not hot. Because it will shrink.
2.0,"I was disappointed in this necklace. For the price, I should have expected it. The silver looks very dirty."
2.0,I was hoping that it would look similar to the picture on the screen but it was very cheap looking and I just placed it on my dresser.  That's ok it's my loss.  I still Love Amazon they are great at what they do. I will always be a faithful customer.
2.0,"Stiff, rigid, scratchy, and not small enough."
2.0,"It's exactly that, just ok, it's all stretched out, the OU is just a plastic piece stuck on and came right off, I tried to glue it back on but it won't stay. The colors aren't a true white and red but an off white, more of a cream and red, really disappointing for a die hard Sooner fan, I don't recommend it at all, I made my own that came out much better.Also the plastic clip broke right off."
2.0,Made of cheap material. Some are too small and don't fit. Others broke after one time use. The quality is worth the price I guess.
2.0,I wore once and washed and the second time to wear it tore along the behind . I never put my leggings in dryer I let them hang dry. The hip area was snug and the ankle are loose and the tummy part was just right
2.0,This fit much smaller than expected.
2.0,"This was tight in the shoulders and arms then extremely loose in the bust area. Even though it was exactly the right color, the fit was definitely NOT flattering so I returned it."
2.0,Fits a little too small order up 1/2 size
2.0,"I‚Äôm a size 6 in pants, wear a size small in dresses, a size small to medium in tops and am 5‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô.  This dress awkwardly gets tighter as it goes down. It fits perfectly on the top, but then gets super tight in the waste area, and given that it has slits on each side, it didn‚Äôt feel casual. It reminds me of the tight skirts girls wore back in the day to clubs with slits on the side that were way too stretched out."
2.0,Material ripped after one wearing!
2.0,It‚Äôs too tight.
2.0,Long in my arms small on my chest and the lining was only on the from you could absolutely see through the fabric on the buttocks.
2.0,"Yea these are cute but they sit about 4 inches away from the face so all the sun gets in from the sides!!! What's the point??!?! Yes the package is pretty, but its pretty useless when the shades don't protect your eyes, too bad i really wanted to like these :("
2.0,"Son thought this robe would be perfect with hood and pockets but when he touched it, he was immediately turned off.  &#34;feels like a very old towel with prickles.&#34;"
2.0,"With the weather warming in the East Coast, I was hoping to revisit my grunge garage band 90s childhood with a hooded tartan/plaid button up.  I normally wear an XL top in women and this definitely fit like a M-L. It's also quite thin and made me feel constricted as it has no stretch either. The color is true as pictured and didn't look bad at all but I was disappointed in the hood as well. It was very thin and cheap; I expected it to be a soft thick T-Shirt material at the least. Returning it this weekend for sure."
2.0,It‚Äôs only a plastic not colorful bomb<br />No BT speaker
2.0,The clasp is so small hard to get on would not reorder
2.0,"The velour is way too thin.  I wanted comfy cozy, not sexy."
2.0,Looks good. Unfortunately if you have a slight frame this isn‚Äôt really a good option for you and after attaching a magnet to the harness and shield it broke. Back to the drawing board.
2.0,I mean it‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not quality. It lasted about two weeks until it became green. The bar might be stainless steel but definitely not the jewel itself. I put a clear coat of nail polish and that had helped keep my upper lip from being stained green.
2.0,"Quality seems ok.  Colors are good.  These are adult sizes, not child's!  It will take my 7 year old another 5+ years to be able to fit in this hoodie, he is so disappointed!  I will be returning this."
2.0,Too small to wear. Pretty pattern
2.0,Too big. And really cheesy looking.
2.0,got stuck in my ear and couldn't get it out
2.0,Weren't comfy at all. Had to return.
2.0,Rings two small and writing to small
2.0,The necklace chain broke the 1st day ‚òπÔ∏è
2.0,"I ordered the 9.5mms, but received one 9.5, and one 7.5. They were also very different colors. :("
2.0,"Fits a small face or child only. Wont cover a mans face unless you have a small head.. bummed. The fabric and color were fine. Sizing needs work,"
2.0,After multiple attempts trying to figure out how to put the top on like pictured in the photo I have given up. I even asked one of my girlfriends to help me figure it out and we cannot. Please include some instructions on how to put it on!
2.0,"I did like that this boot jack is simple, wide, heavy and stable. I like the tooled leather piece on the front. But that's about it. The soft leather in the 'U' for your boot heel is poorly attached, and was coming loose. The sides were already scuffed and scratched, it was obviously either used or badly treated before shipping as it was well packed and the carton was intact. The lower end of the jack was gouged and chewed up before the finish was applied, which tells me that not a lot of care was taken in the production of this item. It was definitely not worth the $43+ that I paid, and I am in the process of returning it with no plans to reorder from this vendor. A pity, as the concept is great!"
2.0,This jacket was very skimpy and there was no return info connected with it so I am stuck with it!
2.0,Cheap bend easy
2.0,"This product did not fit well. It was a little tight. I am 5'7"" 190 lbs. It is a one piece in front but a 2 piece to the back. The back piece did come all the up the waist. Most importantly It did not give the lower abdomen tummy control it promised."
2.0,The glasses frame broke after a week. Not as advertised
2.0,It's much bigger than I expected and not as pretty as I'd hoped.
2.0,This was bulky and not a digital pedometer - it's one of those that click when you move.  Should've read the description more carefully.
2.0,Bought the largest size to fit my size 12 body and it ended up fitting my petite cousin who is a size 0-2.  I would have been more satisfied if it fit as expected but gave it two stars since I found someone who could wear it.
2.0,"The earings are very well made and cute, but they are so difficult to put on. That are very small and they squeeze your earlobe to lock."
2.0,I really wanted to love this ring but i'm disappointed.. Its thin and looks like wire.<br />Not my best buy..
2.0,When I bought this for some reason it seems to be making a statement Im not sure of. What was the artist trying to say?
2.0,"Was so disappointed because I loved the bag, but I also like a long strap. The long one broke after a relatively short time of use, so without it I don't use the bag anymore - bummer!"
2.0,It ran small and wasn't very high quality material
2.0,Didn't know the back of the shirt is white....wish the whole thing was black with the design.
2.0,Seemed to be a bit small. Not a fan of the way the top shaped your breast
2.0,"The shorts seem fine, cheaply stitched but the real problem is that you don't get the belt with the shorts. If I am buying an item and the pants or shorts show a belt there better be a belt otherwise that is VERY DECEPTIVE marketing. If I was buying a blender I would expect it to come with the canister and not just the base. Kinda the same with a bicycle. I would expect it to come with tires, wouldn't you?<br /><br />Update - For a size 32 these are too small. My bad as I already washed them. The other pair from same seller are way too big. After this I will stick to going to the store and trying shorts or pants on. just another pair of low quality shorts being sold on Spamazon."
2.0,"Be aware! The white is see through<br />I was exited about this dress but the fit was just a little too frumpy (I ordered a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù 115lbs)"
2.0,"This would have been an adorable top if it<br />1.) Had not been obviously used, complete with makeup on the collar and reeking of body odor and cheap perfume<br />2. If it hadn't been so poorly constructed; the sleeves/mesh insets were tearing off their solid fabric counterparts.<br />The seller should be docked for selling a filthy used garment as new"
2.0,"Pretty cool, but the screw that holds the pendant keeps coming undone."
2.0,definitely size up
2.0,Very cheap... as the price would indicate.
2.0,"Sleeves were puffy and cute, but dress was sooooo small. Tiny and not stretchy."
2.0,Lovely idea but bad in execution.  I couldn‚Äôt get my shirt in there precisely enough to avoid wrinkles and the contraption weighed more than I expected.<br /><br />Probably ok for someone who uses extra stiff starch on their shirts and can carry a bigger and heavy bag than I can.
2.0,"I ordered this watch for my son.<br />It looks great, it is very nice.<br />I just hate that you have to wind it every day.<br />I knew it had to be wound up but that it would then be self-winding while you move throughout the day like similar watches.<br />I should have read the description better so that is my fault.<br />My son also thought the band was a bit on the small side.<br />Everyone loves his watch but being a teen he does not care for or always remember to wind it up so we have found that he does not wear it that often. Also, we noticed that even when he winds it up it does not always last all day.<br />Such a shame as it is a great looking product."
2.0,Inner liner torn after a few months of very light use. Also inner liner tends to pull out when removing gloves. Cheaper for a reason.
2.0,I really wanted to love these. I bought these while my sister was visiting so we could have fun in the pool. They fit great and are very comfortable but they didn't last two dives into the water before they fogged up. We made sure we fitted them properly to our heads and that the suction sealed fine but we had to stop using them because they fogged up so bad every time we'd go underwater. Very disappointing. :(
2.0,You get what you at for. It was not as impressive in person as it is in the photo.
2.0,Got these for my brother for a birthday gift he said he really liked
2.0,"The fabric is very thin.  The shorts are poorly made. I had to sew up a seam that wasn‚Äôt caught, which was not a big deal, but still. I will wear these around the house, but wouldn‚Äôt plan to wear them out anywhere."
2.0,Not the greatest quality. Showed up with a snag. Returned
2.0,Wow. I ordered a 4x and it fits like a large...<br /><br />I really would not recommend this at all.<br /><br />*I received this at a discounted price in return  for my opinion
2.0,Wish I could have received it by mail & not by email.
2.0,I returned these because the ran small but we're stretched out in the ball area of the foot. Weird.
2.0,They aren't very good for my night driving. I would not purchase again.
2.0,"Muy mala calidad, las costuras y el material."
2.0,It was to thin so I sent it back
2.0,"I had high hopes for this dress because it's such an interesting cut and color scheme. Unfortunately, it's not ideal for my body type (short waisted, wider hips.) The height of waist and the flare of the skirt draw a lot of attention to fuller hips and the waist location is not ideal for my proportions, so I didn't feel that cute in it. While it was quite comfortable, it was also larger than I expected...I normally wear size 12, so I ordered a Large and there was quite a bit of room in the waist area. My final issue was the colors...just FYI for this style: the black of the dress fades with one wash. :-(<br /><br />It looks super cute on other people, from what I've seen in the reviews...but it just wasn't good for me."
2.0,"The pattern is cool and Le SportSac produces quality goods, but this is too big for my pockets, so in order to use it I have to put it in a purse. What a bummer. I should have checked the size before ordering.<br /> Check measurements before buying."
2.0,Didn't care for fit or style of this dress.  It was very plain and drab.
2.0,The color is not the same as in the picture. Very cheap made. I don‚Äôt recommend this purse.
2.0,WAY too short and small. I am a size 10ish 5'8&#34; and 158lbs. This thing hit me mid shin and was super tight all over.
2.0,Not champagne. More of a yellow gold color.
2.0,"Shoes looked great, fit well, my daughter loved them, but after a short time the glue/ adhesive that was used on these shoes started to bleed through between the  purple stripes and the pink mesh. They look pretty bad now, yellow/ brownish stains seeping through. These were supposed to be her new shoes for the beginning of the school year and now they are ruined. I have bought this brand of shoe before and never had a problem, not sure why this happened."
2.0,So far only tried one on. The adhesive is just falling off the inside of bra by a single touch. Or I wear the bra and the adhesive sticky party sticks to my body. I don‚Äôt see these lasting very long.<br />I‚Äôve purchased from this seller before and was very happy but something appears very wrong with my recent purchase.<br />I‚Äôve purchased many of these types of bras before but never had an issue like this.
2.0,"The design on this shirt is super stiff and heavy. It's a cheap iron on, not silk screened. Feels like cardboard. I doubt it will last one washing. I feel ripped-off."
2.0,Quality is overall a downgrade from the original but you get what you pay for. The strap does not mate up with the watch fleshly
2.0,Love the color and the softness but they run a little small.  Also came wadded up in the bag so they are wrinkled beyond anything I've seen outside of my kids laundry basket.  I purchased 3 and they all look like rags that someone threw in the corner.  They will all be going back.
2.0,"Im 5'6"" and this barely touches my ankles."
2.0,"It is not a full size sarong and the print is only on one side, plus it‚Äôs a cheap material. You can buy these in Bali for 1 to 2 USD.<br /> I bought another sarongs from this company and they were full sized with a nice soft, strong material. I was dissatisfied with the quantity of this sarong at the price. Patten is nice, but it should be full sized and the absolute cheapest cloth with only one side printed!"
2.0,Cute but not well made. Can't read some of them.
2.0,"Very pretty, thin and lightweight. I think I would've loved it if the clasp hadn't broken 15 minutes after I put it on."
2.0,"I liked the design of the necklace, however it was so small you couldn‚Äôt read the sentiment."
2.0,Opening too small
2.0,"Bought for a photo shoot but will not be wearing it. The bottoms elastic is very tight and uncomfortable while the lace part itself felt long and diaperish. The top, while having an underwire, has no support, and the wires poke up into your side/ under arm if you lift your arms. The design is cute though."
2.0,"They seemed well made, just ran way too small so had to return.  Couldn't really judge anything else since I couldn't get them on."
2.0,Material was ok but the color was clear off and the cut is terrible making you look VERY incredibly awkward. If it wasn't on sale I would have be insanely angry
2.0,The bottom of this dress is so pretty and the fabric is soft. But the top part wraps strangely and is not even a little flattering. Definitely should have ordered a size smaller but decided not to return it because I'll just make the fabric into something else.
2.0,Color isn't even close.  Not mint green but actually bright teal blue.
2.0,"Didn't quite fit right. Too tight on the nose, and if you slide it up then the shades ate too high.<br /><br />Also started falling apart 2 months later, brittle."
2.0,"These shoes came in a zip lock bag and tops were dented. I thought they'll go away as I wore but these dents got worse!  If they were leather, may be they'd have gone back to their normal shape. The inside support is very thin and hard, so not comfortable. The only good part is the bottom (sole) - very sturdy (reason for the extra star)."
2.0,"These were really cute, but the leg openings are completely loose where the non-slip part hits. I didn't take them for a ride since I knew that they would not stay in place. I do not have small quads, so I am not sure who could use these."
2.0,Too big for me and no case for them  will not buy there again  appear to be good quality but not for me
2.0,"I loved the look but after one wash, the stripes frayed at seam."
2.0,I found it to short and too full (making me look wide) returned
2.0,Glow in the dark option for the hands do not work.
2.0,They were too big and sending it back is getting to be a problem. Buy a size smaller!
2.0,"The shirt was really soft and felt good on the skin but it was so sheer that you could see EVERYTHING underneath. Not only the nipples but the entire outline of the breasts and even my back. The fabric really clings to your whole body. I looked like I had been in a wet t-shirt contest.<br />It looked good but it's not something I would ever be able to wear outside of my home. Even if I were to wear a bra with it, the bra would be 100% visible so it would just look tacky.<br />2 Stars because if you're ok with the wet t-shirt/tits-out look, it's a decent top. Just wish it wasn't transparent."
2.0,The metal piece that goes across your nose was off center & wouldn't budge
2.0,"It‚Äôs a fine cheap watch band. I wore mine to work for about a month or two before the clasp broke, you get what you pay for."
2.0,It‚Äôs not sterling silver it will tarnish mine lasted about a month. It‚Äôs beautiful just as pictured but it will fade.
2.0,It runs small and the front straps are to long. Awkward fit
2.0,i fell in love with this anklet but it broke apart the first day. very unhappy about it.
2.0,"I'm pretty disappointed in this, I saw the reviews that people used this as a Stitch costume but it looks nothing like Stitch. It's a very baby blue in color with magenta ears. The ears are really short. It's just not cosmetically what I was hoping for."
2.0,Gave it as a Christmas Gift and still couldn't give it away to anyone else.  Just didn't work like I expected.
2.0,"These were cheaply made, not worth the money."
2.0,"Beautifuk watch, but it fell apart within 1 ¬Ω week of normal wear"
2.0,"These overalls were much smaller than the size chart indicated. I am on the tall side at 5'8"", but they were not baggy enough, as the description said, to compensate for my height."
2.0,"Could be great but with the way my thighs are, they don't want to stay up.  The lace parts do have the sticky stuff to help hold on and it your thighs are pretty straight, I think this would work.  But sadly, mine aren't and they just fell down."
2.0,Material is nice just seems to be designed for a very very petite woman
2.0,"The charms on this item are very cheap looking and this is one continuous pc like a necklace, not 3 different pcs like it appears to be in the picture."
2.0,Only received one pack of three shirts. Totally inconvenient to return
2.0,"I received my bags today. I'm very disappointed with the color! The bags are a salmon color. The pictures showed a true orange, which I need for my trip, and was so happy to find. I have no time to return or exchange it before my trip. The bag insert that I bought is the exact color that I was expecting the large bags to be. So be warned that the advertised orange is a very red/pink/orange color or Salmon."
2.0,Loved them until they broke 2 weeks later. The whole piece that goes into your ear fell off randomy and I couldn‚Äôt place it back in.
2.0,wasnt shiny enough for me lol its more of a faded holo and not very obvious. Also I wish I got a larger size
2.0,"Cute enough but bad sizing. Size up 2 sizes at least. Very small & short waisted. Ordered ""wine/red"" but it's really brown, not red at all."
2.0,These are basically a thong.  I threw them out because they wee uncomfortable and disgusted my wife.
2.0,"It was way smaller than I was expecting. Real thin, it is cute though."
2.0,Much smaller than would of expected
2.0,"It‚Äôs pretty and looks nice but broke 2 days after when I dropped it with keys accidentally ... I mean it looked very sturdy so I didn‚Äôt expect that at all, kinda sad though"
2.0,Order 2-3 sizes up.
2.0,"These socks are NOT grey (which I love).  They are PURPLE...not slightly purple or greyish-purple but a medium hue of grape or plum.  This was not a product sent in error - the cellophane packaging was also labeled 'grey'.  They are otherwise soft and the fit is good, quality okay and just enough stretch.  For the cost of the item, too much of a pain to return them and figure I'll wear them around the house."
2.0,"Fabric wise this was a great purchase - nice and stretchy if a little less give on the waist band.<br />The big upset was this particular print. It makes you look like you might have had an accident. Sailor Moon's elbow, with the red bit of her glove, wrap under the crotch area and onto the rear making it so awkward (see back photos to get an idea then imagine it even worse). Every person I saw within the first 2 hours of wearing (thankfully all friends while I was home), very first thing, commented that it looked like I had a bowel movement."
2.0,"I really like the style and pattern of the dress, but the size is way too big and the top/neckline is very loose. I ordered a small which is my usual size but I cannot wear this dress."
2.0,"The case only has the adhesive on the edge of the screen protector. Although it is pretty thick, it's more of a negative because it's so thick you have to really press down on the screen. I can't even correctly pull down the notification bar. I am definitely buying another one from another company."
2.0,"One already broke after a month of use. I was optimistic about this product after having used these type of devices for over 15 years.  Yet another failure.  The metal mechanism came undone and will not go back together.  So, I am just left with one working side while the other is now inoperable.  Save the money and go with the classic ones.  Simple and they won't hurt the wallet."
2.0,"Fit good  for the first time, washed them once and they were real tight"
2.0,"I don't like the material, the way it feels, or the sizing of the strap. Doesn't look that great."
2.0,Sticks out pretty far but if you like that it‚Äôs cute
2.0,"I went for one 3 mile run right after I got them and the thighs were already starting to show wear. Definitely see through with doing squats or deadlifts, but not see through for running or light gym activity. I won't be buying again. Check the Bayleaf co for better ones."
2.0,1 the sleeves look different than the picture.<br /><br />2. It goes to look as well tailored as in the picture
2.0,This is our second pair. One shoe on the first pair stopped working 15 minutes after my son put them on. They had been charging all night so we know it wasn‚Äôt the battery. We tried charging it again after it stopped working and it still didn‚Äôt work. Second pair are still working but they are rather stiff and also run on the small size. Super cute colours though and fun for the kids when they do work.
2.0,Hat was to big.
2.0,Cute but came with missing pieces
2.0,hat looked nothing like this... it was oddly purple and had winy bits in it
2.0,"Ordered a size 10.5-11. It fits a 4 or 5 year old girl. In a few months the slippers will be too small. It's now too complicated and expensive to return it overseas. The size numbers are confusing and there are no size parsing tables. It also turns out that some slippers appear to envelop the foot all around, while others have an almost open heel back-side, which disappointed us."
2.0,Didn't look right in the chest area when wearing
2.0,Very cute! Unfortunately after one wash it completely faded.
2.0,...would have been a fun piece of costume accessory but it was smashed in shipment so must go back to the seller.  A more sturdy shipping container (like a small cardboard box rather than a plastic bag) would have protected it in transit.
2.0,The color was not as bright as i imagined. It took awhile for the product to arrive. The product seems cheaper then what you would expect
2.0,Dress was super cute but as mentioned in other reviews the zipper sticks and it was a little small on me. I would exchange for a bigger size but I think the next size up would be too big. Thinking of just getting it alerted to be a deep v backed dress.
2.0,Would be a very pretty shirt if it fit! I wear medium/large and I couldn't even get the XL past my shoulders. If you're petite than go for it! Otherwise don't bother. Took a long time to come in the mail as well.
2.0,Fits very very small.
2.0,Width is big so it does not tight enough.
2.0,"This dress feels like a paper napkin. And it looks like a paper napkin to. Is a photo from the front it doesn't look half bad but from the side or the back, it really does have that paper quality to it. It just looks and feels cheap. I love the color but that's about it."
2.0,"The dress fit, but it's not very flattering.  Kind of hangs and looks like a Little house on the prairie dress. too short. Im only 5'4&#34;. pretty color."
2.0,"Pretty band but the pins weren't long enough, didn't stay clipped"
2.0,"These are very tight in the waist. Maybe they're girls, I'm a miss."
2.0,Logo is what I wanted but the material is not very comfortable.  It is too thick and not very stretchy.  It's ok if you like your shirts a bit over sized. But will not be comfortable on a hot day or you have wide shoulders and a small waist and like your shirts to be more fitting.
2.0,Seeds arrived rather smashed up inside the necklace and it really wasn't pretty to look at. I was going to give this as a gift but decided against it based on the smashed up seeds and cheap look.
2.0,Nice quality but had to return because it was too small. Got XXL which would compare to US size L
2.0,"This bra is a lovely color I love the materials, it appears to be well made, BUT the sizing is too small for me. I ordred the largest size, and its not comfortable at all."
2.0,I thought it was it itchy. Not soft at all. I returned it.
2.0,"These are indeed Kerrits breeches, but the whole reason we ordered them was because in the description it states they have pockets.  Sadly there are no pockets."
2.0,"Very cute good quality! The bar is to short in length for heart shield. Recommend buying tongue rings to replace.. beyond that , they‚Äôre perfect"
2.0,"This is some cheap fabric - thin polyester.  The colors are OK, and it fits fine, but I really don't love the feel of it on my skin.  Polyester has come a long way over the years and they do have the ability to make it soft or resemble another fabric like wool or cotton, but this is straight up stretchy polyester.  I received it as part of the vine program so I'm going to wear it for sleeping anyway, but I don't know what I was expecting.  I don't think if I saw this in a store I'd even stop to look at it because it looks and feels cheep."
2.0,These jeans are nice and have a good shape to them however the material is very hard and not stretchy at all. I ordered a size I up and they were still way too small. I would recommend these for those with little curves.
2.0,"I have basically no torso and unfortunately this dress just hit me weird and made me look bigger/even more hippy than I already am. Will be returning :(  otherwise length/overall fit was good and I loved the pockets. Definitely size up if you're busty, the top will stretch out easily."
2.0,Color is not even close to the real thing. Looks plum in the picture and i got a pink color. The medium is really tight and small so I would size up
2.0,so disappointed... its pretty but no pink in the stone at all. Returned :(
2.0,"One of the french hooks started to turn black and irritate my ear. Never got them wet, only wore them about 20 times. I would not buy again, at nearly 20 dollars I expected higher quality. The stones are beautiful"
2.0,cant say much about comfort they did not fit
2.0,"A little too short, and not fond of the hemmed cuff."
2.0,"I found this shirt a bit bizarre. The description says plus-sized? Yet when I ordered it, it didn't say plus-sized, no where in the description. I am not plus-sized and ordered a large (which should of been on the bigger size) and it was too snug and a bit too long. It wasn't flattering at all. I am returning it."
2.0,"As others said, its not the same outfit or material.  Even though its wearable, you feel completely duped and know that the seller was deceptive."
2.0,It does stick and it is easy to remove as for support there was none. It did not work as I had imagined at all.
2.0,"Fabric feels cheap and is clingy, doesn't flow nicely either, not flattering fit"
2.0,I did not like it it was way too small the material is cheap I ended up returning seller was fa st to respond but It is deffently way too small
2.0,"Appear to be loose in the picture, more like cardboard. Even after washing. Smaller than expected."
2.0,"I wanted so bad to like these. I received so many compliments on them. Unfortunately, the backs provided do not stay on the earrings and most of mine have fallen out and disappeared."
2.0,Nice feel of the material and color.  Runs small.
2.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and about 120 pounds and these fit awkward. The material seems thin. I bought them for work, found myself pulling them up a lot. I don't like them."
2.0,Con: If you plan to give this necklace/bracelet/earring set as a gift you will have to rewrap it.  The packaging looks incredibly cheap.  Pro: The necklace and bracelet are made from real leather.
2.0,Do not fit correctly on my face.
2.0,It was stitched so tight I couldn't get it on or off without help. I returned it. Too bad because it was very pretty.
2.0,Cheap material. Not as good of quality as some others i found on here. The backs of them are like a felt material not faux leather front and back as i hoped
2.0,Works but the suction cups are a pain to stick to the wall. In the middle of shaving they just pop off making an even bigger mess than if I had just shaved towards the sink.
2.0,my foot size is 10.5.  L/XL socks are a stretch. Would definitely be too small after washing.
2.0,"Idea was good, end product is poor. Spring is so flexible that hard to get your shoe without having to reach down and grab the spoon with your hand to hold it steady enough to help put your shoe on. Defeats the purpose behind buying it."
2.0,I was not impressed with the fabric and the shirt was much bigger than expected. I order as small and I am a size 2.
2.0,The design is ironed on and started peeling off after the first wash and I washed it using the delicate setting with my other tank tops.  The peeling design makes the shirt look cheap.
2.0,"This shirt is cute, but it is not made for larger ladies. It fit just great, the material was great, but the cut is really weird. The first ruffle started right between my chest and my stomach and emphasized every place I would not want it to emphasize."
2.0,"Im around 170, 5'4 and usually wears medium. The medium in this dress fits more like a small, my recommendation is to order a size up."
2.0,"I bought 2 100 piece packs of these anchor charms. I made 50 pairs of earrings over the course of a month, placed them on a jewelry rack. After a couple of weeks the anchor charms turned from silver to almost gold/brass. I liked the silver. All the findings I used are silver. Now I‚Äôm stuck with 50 pairs of earrings that look mismatched!"
2.0,I wore it trying to hide the nose piercing and someone though it was an infected piercing hole or they also said it looked like a pimple. I wore a smile gem stud and less people noticed it than when I was wearing this. I suggest if you are trying to hide it get a colored plug.
2.0,"These earrings are too big and too heavy for me. The latch was stuck, and was hard to open and close."
2.0,I expected this product to true to size but runs very small.  I was disappointed as I wanted it for Christmas Day
2.0,"The leather shoe strings on the slippers broke within the first week. Other than that, the slippers are great."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, but when it arrived it looked like a proverbial old-lady's dress rather than a cheerful dress for a girl.  Judging by how wrinkled it was from the shipping process, I think this dress fabric will wrinkle a lot when worn.  The way the waist was sewn didn't look nice at all.  Unfortunately, I've returned this dress because it didn't live up to my expectations at all."
2.0,"This product is beautiful, however it is too small. I bought three necklaces with a pendant, and each one is a different size."
2.0,Cute but ran big for a small
2.0,"Cute, but WAY too small. Probably not good for women with boobs."
2.0,"Ordered the swimsuit with black strappy bottoms and received plain black ones. Very disappointing. Ordered a medium and it took over a month to receive. im a 36 D and the top is loose. The bottoms fit but then again, they were not the ones I wanted."
2.0,Too large looks ugly. The cloth is very stiff
2.0,Pay close attention to which shape you're buying. The ones that look like they will go to your knees will just barely go past your butt...and I don't have a particularly large butt.
2.0,Cute color but material is cheap looking. Oh well!
2.0,I'm 5&#34;2 and this dress was extremely high wasted so not good for petites...bummed becaue it is very cute.
2.0,The ring came almost perfect except there is a smudge/mark on it when I got it. Would be nice if I could exchange for a new one
2.0,"Super cute suit and a beautiful soft blue, but the seam along the chest came undone within an hour. It is easy to be fixed, but it was annoying to have happen while out and about and in a very obvious place on the suit."
2.0,It's pretty but it came broken..
2.0,"Nice bag, however the long shoulder strap broke the first day of use.  Didn't send back because it has two more handles."
2.0,"Fit ok, I am 16-18 and they were fine. Not super loose but ok. However, the color was very iffy. When I just tried them on and removed immediately. I noticed my thumbs became blue almost afterwards. Returning because of that."
2.0,Would have liked it but it is VERY large. I have the 44mm and I assume that they think only men own the 44s because this is Enormous‚Ä¶ And I by no means have a little rest I am pretty big boned and this is huge! Really disappointed because otherwise it would‚Äôve been a really nice band
2.0,Definitely not what I had hoped/expected
2.0,I loved it but it didn't fit my head. üòë I had to return it.
2.0,Ordered a small since thats what my wife wears but would probably better fit someone who wears medium.
2.0,I love the look of this but it really doesn‚Äôt work well. It doesn‚Äôt stick because the magnet isn‚Äôt very strong. It was hard for me to move my lip in certain ways due to the weak magnet.<br />this is good for a person who wants to test if they want this piercing or not. i would not buy this for daily use.
2.0,I geel the crimson color on this jacket is too red for a wsu product.
2.0,"Glasses are small, probably a better fit for narrow faces."
2.0,The material is nice as is the design bit the shorts ride up into the lady part area which was too uncomfortable to keep them
2.0,Cute for basic top but very thin n see thru. I always get a 2 x n this 1st one that was small
2.0,"Great material, feel and fit.  I wish this had worked.  But I ordered the burgundy and the color is nothing like the picture.  It was BRIGHT red."
2.0,"It's a beautiful piece of jewelry... Except I can't get it open, the chain broke while trying to open it, I ordered what I thought was a necklace but got a bracelet.<br />I have arthritis so trying to open this bracelet hurts my fingers and now that the chain is broken seems fairly redundant ... I wish they would post a video on the best way to open one of these items because they came with no instructions."
2.0,Unfortunately the socks are not good quality at all. The rubber at the bottom literally starts to fall off. They are really thin. I definitely would not recommend them
2.0,The plastic shoe is worthless.  It slips and slides all around your foot until suddenly your heel is hitting the floor or ground.  Its impossible to keep it on your foot.
2.0,So pretty! The butterfly is bigger than I thought it would be. Doesn't stay closed and my daughter lost one.
2.0,"Beautiful and nice design, but paint comes off too easily. I even bought, and used, the $20 bottle of their sealer and the paint is still rubbing off WITH VERY, VERY LITTLE USAGE. It started rubbing off after just a couple of months. I won't be buying the other ones I planned to get."
2.0,"Loved the tanks when they arrived. However, DO NOT DRY THEM! I washed them and now they are 2 sizes smaller. Super disappointed."
2.0,"I originally got these shorts to wear around the yard when I do my yard work.  We have a rather large yard so I am always gardening, weeding, and doing other work around the property.  Having shorts like these seemed like a good idea.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The fabric of these shorts is soft and well worn.  They will last a summer maybe.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style fits well and is actually big on me which surprised me.  At least in the waist and hips I mean.  The 2XL in other clothing has barely fit my kid who is a size 12, so I got the 2XL expecting them to be small.  They aren't.<br /><br />LENGTH<br />Look, I am a clothing designer and have made and designed clothing for a long time.  When you have shorts that fit the way they are supposed to, the front is shorter and the back edge is supposed to be LONGER to cover the larger area of the buttocks.  You are not supposed to cut them off at the same length.<br /><br />These shorts are ridiculous.  The front is okay, but the back exposes the rear.  If that is what you want, then you will like these.  I don't.  I like to keep my underwear to myself.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These shorts fit well on top but the legs are cut off wrong.  They expose the rear a lot.  The front is okay.  The only way I would wear these is with bike shorts under them.  I don't see myself doing that any time soon.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  The fit on top is nice,  IF they had cut off the back tapered longer than the front edge, these would look much nicer, especially in larger sizes.  As they are, they are awful unless you like showing your rear.  I do not.<br /><br />If I have some time in the future, I will alter them into something fun, but I won't be wearing them as they are."
2.0,Wish I would have ordered a whole size down
2.0,"explain to me, why someone wearing 34G bra would want to go 2 cup sizes up? i just finished with breastfeeding and wanted to wear something other than ugly maternity underwear, so i bought this. i received this bra a day before going on vacation, so i had no time to look for other options. it has thick padding inside. i tried it on, it fit. i wore it for half an hour with all the tags attached and 'the dough started rising'. my boobs started falling out of it. i was desperate to wear it in florida, so i thought i'd make a little cut in fabric and pull out the inserts. heck no! they are glued together. i was determined and cut out the damn inserts leaving just a see through mesh. when i put the bra on, the fabric started curling and splitting my boobs in halves. i hate that i threw $38 in trash. i should have gone to nordstrom and tried it on instead. they have it at the same price. just so you know, if you wear a solid a you're gonna end up with d poking through your shirt. if you're like me,size g, people will be wondering how you're still able to remain vertical with those watermelons on your chest."
2.0,"i did not like this product,ther is no shine to it and the one they sent me looks pretty bad"
2.0,The sunglasses fell apart right out of the box. Very disappointing.
2.0,"One of the top ""prongs"" that are meant to keep the foot in place separated itself from the sole. I like the inner sole and the design but at $25/month of sporadic wearing these are the most expensive flip flops I've owned.  Useless and unreturnable they are not flip flops; they are just flops."
2.0,"I just received mine in the mail and loved it at first; the size and appearance is great, however, it is slightly scratched, revealing a copper color underneath. In the light, the scratch looks like a booger. This is upsetting!"
2.0,"I ordered the pink on and the yellow one,the yellow one is way thinner than the pink one.My son loves the yellow color,I will keep it anyway."
2.0,"Super cute, but a chain was already broken off upon opening the box."
2.0,These are cool looking but they run very small and my friend says they are uncomfortable.  I think they are cheaply made and will not hold up well.  I do not recommend.
2.0,They hurt my eyes.
2.0,way too long and did not like the color.
2.0,The ring that holds emblem is a piece of junk kept coming apart nearly lost the emblem few times get another small ring to hold it in place
2.0,Doesnt hang like this on the body. Very frumpy looking.
2.0,The mask looks good but it doesn't fit. It's made for skinnier necks than mine. I wish it had some type of elastic strap on the back. I might have to modify it.
2.0,"The face mask is not darkened and completely see through, but the biggest disappointment is the star on the head is upside down. The photo displayed is correct, but they glued cheap hard fabric upside down to the face and it‚Äôs not correct. Not a big deal to me, but to my 12yo this was a deal breaker."
2.0,Super small be careful
2.0,Some frayed bits that stick out and hurt.
2.0,"Love the color and shimmer, I really wish it fit! Will be sending back. I‚Äôve attached a picture of it (size 2-3) on my almost 3 year old (27 pounds, 34 inches), and a picture of it next to a XS size in the GK gymnastics brand. We‚Äôve learned our lesson and will stick to the well known brands from now on."
2.0,"Not made with longevity in mind. I've been using for a little over a month, followed all washing recommendations, but the back where the straps meet the band has the seams splitting apart. Additionally, this bra offers little support and the pads in the cups slide around everywhere.  Not my favorite maternity bra."
2.0,material poor
2.0,Just not in love with the style.
2.0,Not what I expected and the straps are too tight.
2.0,"Within a week or two of purchase,  threads started to come off the sides of the wristband.  Within two months, the Velcro pulled away from the strap.  It‚Äôs only a wristband so we repaired it with needle and thread.  Very disappointed!!!"
2.0,Had them on for just a few hours and the string broke on on of the bracelets.
2.0,"Very cute, for a small person. Ran way way way too small."
2.0,Not very supportive. Bled colored all over my washing machine the first time I washed them.
2.0,"I have purchased several shirts from this company and they are usually prett good, for the price I don't expect a whole lot but this shirt is a bit disappointing which makes me sad because it is really cute, don't get me wrong I still wear it sometimes I just wish it was more.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Looks exactly like the picture<br />-Cute for casual dress<br /><br />Cons<br />-The shirt fits true to size until you reach the bottom and it is smaller, I wear a size medium and it fits great except the bottom seam is tight around my body<br />-The material is cheap and I personally knew it would be because the shirt was cheap to buy but it is see through, I usually throw a white cami under it so no one can see my goodies."
2.0,They do not fit in my frames. Not sure if they are correct lenses for my glasses. Must be multiple sizes.
2.0,Very cute dress but it is see through and so I had to return it.
2.0,"Cool keychain but the outer area scratches everything it touches. Sad, but I had to can it because it was ruining a lot of random items from my actual car key to various items in my purse."
2.0,"The pjs's are adorable, but quality is not so great. The cat design is disintegrating after only a couple wears/washes."
2.0,Pretty pattern. But way too short if you have long legs. 5‚Äô8 and this hit me mid calf. Don‚Äôt do it if you‚Äôre looking for a maxi skirt floor length skirt.
2.0,Very tight I recommend going one size up if toy don't like a snug feeling
2.0,Strange fabric. Not what I expected.
2.0,Disappointing. I used it for a week (and liked it) before threads came loose and it unraveled.
2.0,they are ok just not what I thought they were. would return them if I could figure out how
2.0,I love the print but is a very thick material. I am normally a size med but really wish I had gotten a small. I might like it better if it fit better.
2.0,Runs very small. Odd material with no stretch
2.0,I liked the color but I did not like it because it's not like the picture that the model was put on its not worth the price.
2.0,"The shorts I received had an attached tag that read ""SO WHAT basic"" (see photo) and a sewn in label that says ""KY"".  I'm not really sure why they call these JackieLove shorts.  I also asked for a Men's waist 29 and got something labeled ""M"" so I am not even sure I got the right size.  They are soft and all, but they are not as form fitting and have funny pleats in the waist band that causes it to not look all that great while wearing.  I first tried to reach out to the company to ask if I received the correct shorts but no one responded...hence the review."
2.0,"This would probably work if you have a svelte figure.  I've got too much stomach and not enough hips and butt.  I tried it for a couple days, but I had to have it stretched so tight that I was afraid it would ruin my belt loops.  It would work well for those who don't need much help keeping their pants up"
2.0,Material cheap for the price. Its small cant even breathe or speak in it. Hurts my ears after worn for work.
2.0,no instructions on how to wear it.  coundn't get it to fit the right way
2.0,"Sent it back. I feel like the stitching would probably pull out after a few uses, and the torso was very very short in comparison to the rest of the fit. Fit well everywhere except for the wedgie part. I‚Äôm not really that tall either, 5‚Äô9‚Äù"
2.0,"I have dupuytren's contracture. These gloves do not help. They give ample compression, but do not alleviate pain and discomfort like the copper compression  gloves do."
2.0,"Poor quality, came apart after two weeks of use. The pin holding the latch came undone. Fortunately, I was able to recover the spring and use a nail (cut to size and filed down!) to replace the pin. Other than that (ha!) I like the way it works and fits, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1."
2.0,"I wished I tried the next larger size.  I went with &#34;Large&#34; for my size 12, 4E feet.  What a hassle to pull on / take off.  And they only compressed half of my foot.  From mid arch, back.to the ankle and then up the calf.  But they survived a typical wash & dry cycle like the rest of my clothes.  So I guess that's a plus."
2.0,Fit great for about 2 days then it started to ride up and needs constant adjusting which is annoying. It's hard to tie in the bag without ripping out my hair at the same time. It's so cute but not practical as it always comes close to slipping off completely
2.0,They broke the first time. They were pretty.
2.0,"very small, made for a child"
2.0,"It's super adorable! The metal pin came out of the fox head before I even wore it though, and even that's fixable, after wearing it once an ear and nose fell off of one and totally ruined it... Thought it would last me one than one time for sure. Poor quality."
2.0,"As soon as I unfolded it I knew it was too small. It looks like a medium, but it's labeled XL (which is the size I always order for a typical sport bra). I also ordered the Amazon brand 2/pack in XL, which was very similar to the standard Nike sports bra (but Amazon's has pull-out foam pads for each cup), which fit just like Nike and other brands I've worn. For the price, it's not even worth returning but it is disappointing I couldn't even get it over my head. The fabric and trim seem typical of a basic sports bra."
2.0,"I liked the fabric, but for me that is where it begins and ends.  The garment was several inches too long in length ( TALL ladies this is for you perhaps) and the  hip area stood out each side (yes , where the inseam pockets are), but added to that was the fact that when you held it up you could see the pattern was cut in an hour glass shape to begin with, so the hip area on me stood way out and it looked terrible!  Then there was the problem with the width of the hem,  it was so narrow you couldn't walk very well in it at all .  Needless to say I had to return it."
2.0,"The tie doesn't look in person as it looks in the picture. The pictures show bright and well defined white dots over a bright red background. In reality, the dots look washed out and it takes away from the overall look."
2.0,Fit great but the bill bent in all the wrong directions so I had to rip and cut the wire to make it work...
2.0,"Literally so see through. No wonder it‚Äôs $10. Also VERY TIGHT, maybe size up"
2.0,The large fits my sister and she wears a size small
2.0,"The padding is great but the band width is not accurate and because it fits a bit snug, the top of the scallops around the band dig into your skin and can cause irritation."
2.0,"I bought this dress for a summer wedding. I got an XL, which is my normal dress size, and I couldn't even get it on. It was such a cheap material and ran about three sizes too small."
2.0,Cute but the material is quite thin and the seams started to unravel after a couple washes. Not the best quality.
2.0,The top was tight in the shoulders making arm<br />Movement hard
2.0,"Ordered sized based on their size chart, too small. Returned and ordered a size larger. I think they sent the same dress back. Returned. Size chart inaccurate"
2.0,Too small for a pregnant woman<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô & 149lbs got a medium 30 weeks pregnant<br />No stretch what so ever
2.0,Really cheap material and fit kind of small. Bummer!
2.0,not made very well
2.0,"EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY FLANNEL, it's already ripping at the cuffs and have only had it since Christmas. Color, style and fit were spot on.  SO DISAPPOINTED ..  Especially for  the $$  :("
2.0,Looks nice but had to stop wearing it because it catches your clothes constantly and snags them.
2.0,"Fits ok, but I did not like the material. It is Shiny, and not what I expected. ."
2.0,The bottoms were really big. But the top fit just right
2.0,"Low quality material and sewing.<br />The first time I ordered this dress, I did not get the reviewer price and so I ordered it again with plans of returning the one that I paid the higher price for.<br />I contacted the company and they never followed up with me...AT ALL!"
2.0,"The finish is okay. I bought it for my 2013 SBDC001, but the strap came before the watch, so I fit it onto my SBDC003 (the blue version), and it wouldn't fit correctly at all. The ends of the band that connect to the lug have a hard time pushing in, and even with tools, it's EXTREMELY difficult or impossible to push the lugs into the holes.<br /><br />Otherwise the material is great. Delivery was great. Packaging was great. Just didn't fit the product."
2.0,too small - order one to two sizes up. material is somewhat cheap feeling.
2.0,"My kid loves these. I am told they fit well and are comfortable. However, they wore the shoes for a couple of weeks and one of the soles broke away from the heal to mid foot. We had it repaired and it happened again. I realize we didn‚Äôt spend $100+ initially but after repairs, we might as well have."
2.0,The remote screen does not display the camera image as advertised which is my only major issue
2.0,I was expecting a silver earwrap as detailed in the pictures and the item description. I received a gold one.
2.0,I've tried to wear this bracelet several times but the size of the beads and the stiffness of the leather make it very uncomfortable to wear. I think I'm going to return it
2.0,"I was so excited to get these hoops, after 10 minutes my entire earlobes were bright red and painful from the weight of them!!"
2.0,In love like crazy with this nose ring! Yes it takes some work to get in. But with two pairs of plyers I got it in in about 5 min. Within 4 hours a stone fell out so it‚Äôs trash now. Really dissipointed!!
2.0,The lens are very flimsy
2.0,Quality is okay. It did not fit me properly.
2.0,"This is a &#34;One Size Fits All&#34; but it is Way too small.  I'm by no means a big girl, pretty average in fact.  Not only is it too small, the pads are pretty poor as they have funny wrinkles that make it look &#34;lumpy&#34; under your shirt."
2.0,"FIT SMALL , PETITE"
2.0,Very thin you to have to wear something thick under it. I thought it would be lined at least. My fault ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2.0,Item arrived as described and is a very cute product.  However the chain quickly broke and the elephant is actually very big
2.0,Belt sent was not leather and have to return.
2.0,"Not what I expected,returned for a refund"
2.0,Good for skinny leg girls.
2.0,"Cheap , get what you paid for I guess. It was for Halloween so I wore for a short period of time. We did a grease theme for family theme and every one else‚Äôs costumes bought off amazon looked great but mine just looked cheap"
2.0,It will work.  but the there is still a hole in it for the wire to come back through.
2.0,"I returned these, just not a style i liked. I felt it was odd to have shorts on top of shorts, i was hoping the liner underneath would be more like boy short underwear vs another pair of shorts."
2.0,The color was off and it didn‚Äôt crisscross in the front like shown.
2.0,rolls down as soon as you lean over.
2.0,Started off fine but broke after only 2 rounds. Very poor quality
2.0,I returned these because the were very tight on the baby.
2.0,Made for small women even in the largest size
2.0,Cute but offered no upper body support.  I guess I should have assumed that with such thin straps there would be no support.  Lesson learned
2.0,disappointed  did not help with sore feet
2.0,"This dress looked nice, but it did not fit me. Matter if fact I never wore it cause it didn't fit my chest area. I bought the size according to their chart and it was still way too small."
2.0,Jeans was thin but comfortable  but was very disappointed in the length of the pants. Was very short and I am 5ft 6. And the left pant leg was shorter and more flared likeva boot cut at the end  while the right pant leg was longer and had a skinny jean fit
2.0,Was a cute shirt but the pockets kept hanging out like bunny ears. I returned.
2.0,It was far too small for me. I had to give it to someone else. She enjoys it.
2.0,"Runs big, order 3/4 and it‚Äôs more of a 5/6"
2.0,"The Chain Stitch Men‚Äôs short sleeve check shirt seems to be well stitched and the material is very comfortable, especially for the hot weather that we are currently experiencing.<br /><br />I am a consistent ‚Äòmedium‚Äô size as 99% of medium shirts give me a good, comfortable fit. The Chain Stitch shirt length is medium, but the chest size is smaller than expected (even if it were a slim-fit) and sleeve length is short. It almost seems like a size medium fit below the chest and a size small size above the chest?!!<br /><br />It was too uncomfortable for me to wear. ‚òπ"
2.0,"Really not great for the price. The stitching is half hazard and fabric is poorly aligned, bows are not made with actual attachment hardware and affix with a safety pin which is not strong enough to support the weight of the fabric. The apron in the photo does not have a KFC logo on it but the one I received does... So they obviously stole pictures of someone else's costume and recreated it cheaply."
2.0,"Cute-ish, but it's kind of shapeless. There's no waist and the corset-style lacing looks really fragile and useless. The worst part is that it's ALMOST COMPLETELY SEE THROUGH!!! You best get a black under shirt unless you want the world to see your bra or nips clearly."
2.0,"I selected large by the sizing chart given. I was hoping it would be at least slightly loose but it was pretty snug. I'm not sure it is worth $70, the beard that comes with it is essentially a flap with hair glued to it. The hat had a wire sticking out of the brim. The best part is that it is a onesie that has a removable cape but even then you could find something similar at a store like walmart or target for cheaper."
2.0,"This cropped bra was the cheapest price on amazon that I believe, so I decided to try them. I ordered the white one L and the pink one XL. White one was very cheap thin material and the pads were wonky. I wear 36D and L fits me well. Material was not durable at all, felt like super cheap cami- bra. I haven‚Äôt decided to keep the white one. The pink one was nice material, so I would recommend you get the pink one. You can wear it at the gym but not the white one though"
2.0,I only used it for a couple of months before it broke.
2.0,Product looked fine from the front but the backside showed a fatal flaw which caused the stone to break off when attempting to wire wrap.
2.0,This dress was HUGE and also very cheap material. I returned it with no issues for a refund.
2.0,"There is a red line across the suit.  The first one I bought had it too and I returned it thinking it was a freak mistake. But the ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù has it too.  Disappointing, because we otherwise really liked it."
2.0,"This was cute online. however in person the shirt smelled pf some kind of Chemical, Stinks! and the skirt is very very PAPER THIN also see through, If wore I suggest putting  little shorts underneath.  Not at all what I expected, I returned no thanks for my granddaughter."
2.0,Quality is very poor.  Very thin. And very difficult to tie the straps back and hook them.
2.0,You put them in with rubber bands.  Some didn't work and they don't last long when they do
2.0,"The quality seemed fine, but it was so tight on my head that I couldn't wear it for more than a minute."
2.0,"I really loved this light pink color but when I received it it was hot pink - a color I wouldn't have ordered. I feel it's inconsiderate of the company to switch colors without asking. I would've returned it but it's too much of an inconvenience. Also, my almost 5 year old girl has an average size head and this was really tight on her and it didn't cover any of her face as the picture might lead one to believe. I would not order from this company again."
2.0,Loved the material of them but was not necessarily high waisted. They kept falling down and sagging and was uncomfortable. Then the top part of it ripped before washing them!
2.0,This took a long time to arrive. Bloomers were a neon green and didn't go well with the top.
2.0,I just received my package in the mail 5 minutes ago and I was opening it everything was great. That outfit is totally cute my only negative about the outfit is that it is very thin mostly good for something to wear in the spring not recommended for winter unless you're going to put thermals underneath the pants and the hoodie. Inside the hoodie there was some very loose threading that I posted overalls the remainder of the inside being intact nothing that you can't take a pair of scissors to I guess. I am hoping that when I do cut it it does not unravel the whole thing Therefore I may just leave it the way that it is.
2.0,"Its a cute enough dress. The material reminded me of lining material, almost like what you might find as the top layer of a crinoline skirt you wear under a wedding dress. Didn't like the way it fit, I'm sure my proportions had at least a little to do with that, but there was definitely something off about the way it was cut to the point that it ended up not even looking like the picture."
2.0,Like the shirts but the sent the wrong size was supposed to get a small and they sent mediums.
2.0,"the trim on the neck and shoulder sleeves give it away like its a dirt cheap low quality item... other than that, i love the pattern of the lace."
2.0,"I fell for the reviews - all the ones that said these, both skinny leg and straight leg, were great work pants. There is absolutely no way I could wear these to work, and I work in a casual environment. The external seaming, the fabric, the cut - all inappropriate for a pair of work pants. These fit like, and the fabric felt like, workout pants. In addition, I wanted them for travel and walking around when touring. The fabric is very thick around the torso area. I was hot just trying them on, I can only imagine how much I'd sweat in these walking around in warmer weather. I also felt they were too workout looking to wear for traveling. Sent them back."
2.0,"As others reviewed, it does run small.  I liked how it has a high neckline, but be aware the material is see through.  My biggest complaint is that one of the straps broke after the second time of wearing.  Another strap broke yesterday (after many more wears).  I was diappointed as I have only had these camis for 2 months."
2.0,"Pros: lightweight, good water-resistance, durable rip-stop, large zipped thigh pockets that don‚Äôt stand out<br /><br />Cons: waist measures 2-4‚Äù too large, loud swish sound, pretty baggy (maybe due to improper sizing), limited stretch: not 4-way<br /><br />Buy Again? Maybe only if they‚Äôd fix the waist size or offered a smaller waist size.<br /><br />1.) Incorrect size: Ordered size 32x34 (I‚Äôm tall and skinny). The tags say 32‚Äù, but the waist is much too large. The waist actually measures 34‚Äù with a measuring tape (without stretching the elastic - refer to picture), and even goes up to 37‚Äù when stretched. So these are actually 34-37‚Äù, not 32‚Äù. Unfortunately, they don‚Äôt sell size 30x34 (which would actually be size 32x34).<br /><br />2.) 2-Way Stretch Material: The seller said the material is 4-way stretch while responding to another customer‚Äôs questions about using them for golf - this is definitely not true. The material is 2-way stretch and only stretches horizontally, but not vertically. I purchased these for ascending mountains, so I wish they would stretch more vertically in the knees. The description now says 2-way stretch, so the description is correct (don‚Äôt refer to the seller‚Äôs response).<br />Also, the material is noisy - it has the distinct nylon ‚Äúswish‚Äù sound when walking.<br />As a positive, the coated material seems very water-resistant - water droplets seem to bead up nicely and not soak in. Usually coating degrades over time, but I‚Äôm curious to see how durable it is.<br />The material is very thin and lightweight - great for hot weather. It also appears to be rip-stop, which is nice for durability."
2.0,"Has no support at all, by saying it's a sports bra I would have imagined it would have some sort of support..."
2.0,"So tiny they get lost under my fingernails, can't even put in my hole"
2.0,"Loved the material, but sleeves way too tight. Will be returning."
2.0,"Be very careful ordering from this company.  If you look closely at the watch face in the picture (I didn't) you see it is reverse of a standard clock.  It actually runs backwards.  It is like all the mechanisms are reversed.  The watch and chain are appear to be a high quality but it only appears correct when you look in a mirror = maybe that is why they send one with it.  This was not mentioned in any of the obvious descriptions, but is in the picture.  Blaming this on myself not questioning more.  The box also came falling apart in multiple pieces."
2.0,The patter leaves imprints on your leg after a 12 hour day. I bought a simple striped pair from this brand that did not do that. Will only be buying socks without patterns. Otherwise does a great job for compression.
2.0,Exposed screws are sharp and things get caught on them
2.0,Item arrived and was a bit smaller in diameter than sellers advised
2.0,La falda est√° linda pero la tela es muy trasl√∫cida tienes que usar un fondo. No me gusto
2.0,"I gave this to my granddaughter. The hat is cute, fit nicely, but without hardly any wear, once or twice, the strap separated from the Velcro. I returned it."
2.0,It's very cheaply made. I bought one at TJ Maxx and it broke after playing it a few times. I reordered two of them from this seller and they were both already broken when I opened it. The game is super fun but poorly constructed. For $6 I should've expected that.
2.0,"The purse arrived with a broken clasp for the shoulder strap. The feel of the purse is very stiff and it is on the small side. The appearance is nice, but beauty is only skin deep. I don't think handbags are something you can buy online. It's like trying to buy a food you've never seen, tasted or smelled before based on someone else review. Handbags should be purchased in person in a store so you can feel them and try them on and see if they are something you want to make a commitment to. I ended up going to a store and finding a really nice handbag, that probably wouldn't have looked good to me if I saw it online."
2.0,I have purchased several replacement canopies over the years.  This one by far was the WORST fit.
2.0,The shirt material is stiff and manly looking. Does not look anything like what is pictured.
2.0,"Hard to put in,"
2.0,"The cups are way too small. I like the clear back strap, but I will need the shoulder straps to hold the bra up and that defeats the purpose of it being backless. On to the next bra..."
2.0,"I'd been on the hunt for a backpack bag and loved the styling of this bag. So when my son asked what I wanted for Xmas I gave him this link. I was so excited to receive this bag, but upon unpacking the top zipper pull feel off. I attempted to tighten it,but it has fallen off again. I also noticed a seam rip at the bottom right side of the bag. Sadly I guess the quality of this product is lacking, but I love the look and utility üòì. Since I received this as a gift I doubt this merchant will fix this."
2.0,I read the measurements and would fit a large and wanted a size bigger to move in smoother so I went xl and def not a us xl. 5‚Äô7 at 180 and this shirt cuts just below the belt and has no flow just tucks against the skin at an xl. Runs Too small for its shirt type designed to be loose.
2.0,"I wore them about a month and a half every day and I've worn through the sole. I'm disappointed in the quality. I can't afford to have to buy a new pair of shoes ever couple of month because the soles don't last. I wasn't even doing anything crazy in them, just walking around to work and just living my life. It's ridiculous."
2.0,"I tried it on once, decided to keep it. I put it on for the second time two days before my event in order to style my hair and the loop that holds the headband fell apart. No time to return it for a new one, so I decided to sew it back together. Then the felt backing started coming off. glue didn't work so I had to stitch the backing to the fascinator netting. What a mess. I wore it to a wedding and received tons of compliments. Not sure if I would buy from the same company again though"
2.0,This was just ok it looked weird on and I never could make it work
2.0,"While I initially liked this bag for the simple styling and multitude of pockets, I have grown unhappy as after only three months, the inner lining has ripped free from its stitching causing a lot of fraying strings and two useless pockets. Beware, the price is low for a reason."
2.0,This item arrives without the cord not good
2.0,"Too confining up top, too free after chest. Definitely look pregnant in this dress AND can't move. Returned it."
2.0,See through leggings
2.0,Very thin fabric. Two of them had holes in them from the start and it only got worse after I washed them. But you get what you get for the price. Still going to use them but I doubt they'll last as long as other brands I have. They are also rather shallow compared to my other ones so if you have a big head or fluffy hair then these might not work well for you.
2.0,"Just too small. Sleeves were basically 3/4 sleeves, and cardigan was much shorter than depicted. If you're petite, probably a great sweater. I'm 5/7."
2.0,"These sandals were bought and returned. They were too big for my daughter and also fit weird so I didn‚Äôt think that she‚Äôd even grow into them. This is payless‚Äôs brand of shoes, which I‚Äôve had success with in the past, but these seemed of less quality.  Definitely size down if you‚Äôre going to purchase them."
2.0,"They're really cute, but break and fall apart really easy. I have to keep reattaching the chain in places where it comes apart."
2.0,"Really cute and comfortable, but I wear an 8 to 8 1/2 depending on style of shoe and these are way to big my foot floats in them! Should have gone a size smaller"
2.0,This product was a good material but it‚Äôs not Queen written on it it‚Äôs written BITCH WAS NOT SATISFIED BECAUSE OF THAT
2.0,You better have really flat feet to fit comfortably in these
2.0,Too Small... I bought a 3X and it fits like a medium<br />\
2.0,These are not for anyone over 3 years old. It was a waste of money for our adult 80's themed party.
2.0,"Mask was to large, the face was off centered and the skin color was pink and orange"
2.0,"maybe its my fault selecting slim fit, but it way too tight and barely move hands, I do have a little paunch so...guess its me!"
2.0,I got a lil bit too much fat to rock this fit!
2.0,Cute but the mustache piece was very small and fit around my husbands chin.  No way to get it to look like picture. Disappointed.
2.0,"Very delicate, material is not pure. My skin reacted to it, since I am allergic to nickel."
2.0,Poorly made.  Doesn‚Äôt lay right
2.0,This must be returned as sizing is so wrong . I am really a medium but ordered large for comfort. This large is made for XS.  Aside from horrible sizing material is nice and it is cute.
2.0,I really thought this would look and feel like a lightweight rain jacket.  It‚Äôs actually too lightweight like a drug store poncho!  Disappointing.  I decided to keep it to throw into a travel bag instead of a plastic poncho
2.0,"Color isn't the same as in add.  Dress is also see through in bust/Chest. Dress fit properly and as expected, but quality was terrible. Returning.  I am a size 14 with large chest. Purchased XL."
2.0,"The watch it self is really nice! But they added a very faded photo. I think to have the inside match how nice the outside is, on the hour marks of the clock they should have been actual diamond studs. Instead, they have white dots in the place of them."
2.0,It's to small but cute
2.0,"I know the saying, you get what you pay for, but this thing just looks cheap. Might as well have been costume jewelry. The supposed center diamond had a black spot like one setting was missing. Upon inspection, there is nothing missing, it is just cut really bad or something and looks terrible. The chain is so flimsy it looks like it might break if you pick it up. Girlfriend refused to even take it out of the box."
2.0,Really adorable...but did not it my particular phone.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:ee3d7686ae1f696e1a5f236e7e31de02]] As soon as I put them in my shoes, they popped off. I'll just put some crazy glue or gorilla glue on them."
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt really impressed with color I wanted black and red and I got black and a dark pink definite not red
2.0,I know these were cheap but they look even cheaper in person. Mine had dirty lenses and it feels like the whole thing will fall apart at any moment.
2.0,"Material is cheap, flimsy, thin and wrinkled like crazy when you get it.  The only nice thing I have to say is it is comfortable to wear.  Using them as pj's."
2.0,"Love the Rich green color. Love the flowy trapeze style. Unfortunately, dress got caught up in dryer and shrunk a lot... probably an oversized top now.  Hand wash line dry...wish it came to with instructions."
2.0,Straps fell apart after one wash.
2.0,Loved the fit but the pockets just hung out which was weird because pants were loose. Just not enough denim on the pockets
2.0,Too small. I wear a size 7 and sometimes 7.5
2.0,Looks good but kind of small doesn‚Äôt cover my 5 yr old face good
2.0,"This is a paper thin ""sweater"". You can almost see through it... I must have been confused thinking it was a heavier knit."
2.0,To small for my wrist
2.0,This is pretty but the material is thin and there isn't much to support covering up the ladies. If I went a size bigger I would have been lost in the dress but the small did not cover my up nearly enough.
2.0,Cuts down glare in the day . Just makes lights a bit less bright at night. Nowhere like their advertisements show. The movies are a con
2.0,The globe is mounted loosely and rattles every time I shake my wrist.<br />The &#34;continents&#34; are completely random (you can see this in the product photo) and bear no resemblance to earth.<br /><br />The cufflinks themselves are unusually long.
2.0,"I bought this for a conch piercing and figured I could maneuver it into my ear by sliding it up or down until it was set but, it‚Äôs just not right.  The fish prevents enough movement one way or the other to fit it into your ear.. I was so sad about it because it would be really cute in my dang ear‚Ä¶ since I can keep a ball screwed on the top and remove the bottom one, I might just cut the post and put it in my ear since I can‚Äôt return it.. but, just consider this when you buy.  If you have larger than normal ears, it will probably work great."
2.0,"Bought as a graduation gift for a friend. The stones are pretty but, the clasp is so flimsy and cheap, I was too embarased to give it to her."
2.0,"Although I love the look of these glasses, they are much bigger than expected.  A bit too costume like."
2.0,Did not like the feel of the material
2.0,"Fabric is pretty and looks like the picture.  No stretch at all.  5‚Äô 3‚Äù and 145# bought the large, too small, couldn‚Äôt zip it up.  Will have to return."
2.0,I ordered based on my normal size and this was somewhat snug. I love the color and style so I kept it
2.0,All different sizes and the metal has sharp points that ruin clothing and the gold colors are awful
2.0,Buttons weren‚Äôt lined up. I guess that‚Äôs what you get when you order cheap stuff from China....
2.0,Why can't they make these in normal adult sizes that allow things to breathe?
2.0,Two of the belt holes split after wearing it only 3 days. But it is still usable.
2.0,"This is a nice garment; as others have noted it is a somewhat thin fabric. However it is extremely poor quality control to send out a garment that has a hole half the size of a dime. It is too much trouble to send back and I am only wearing it in the house, but this will dissuade me from purchasing anything else from this vendor."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt really like the color. Size a little too small.
2.0,"Meh....  Its girly and not the pimp style that LOCS is capable of... LOCS is a home run allllll the time, but missed it with these"
2.0,product didn't meet my expectations.
2.0,"Got the wrong color on the mail, not what I ordered. Very soft and warm though."
2.0,The XXL was too small in the chest area and it does not run big to have the oversized effect
2.0,Too big to be a size small 5. The shoe label on the it is annoying you can feel it on tne bottom of your feet. Nice color but I'm going on Target.com to buy a better fitting slippers. I should of returned them but I was too lazy to go to the post office.
2.0,"This band allowed my Luminox to be ripped off my wrist while surfing Makaha in overhead surf. Do not use in heavy surf.<br />Went back 2ith snorkle next day, couldnt find watch. Easy way to lose $200."
2.0,"Mordenmiss Women's Long Sleeve Thicken Warm Winter Hooded Down Jacket Coat STYLE 4 BURGUNDY. I am 5'8&#34;, slim built, Medium/Large Tops. Long arms and wide shoulders. PROS: Burgundy color, Length of arms, Length of Jacket to mid thigh, White Jersey Sports Band on Hood. CONS: Runs 2 sizes too big and the shell of the coat is more of a pear/egg shape. PICTURED: Size XL"
2.0,One antler came off within two weeks. It‚Äôs totally missing. Came completely off with the windows shut ???
2.0,Returned- changed mind
2.0,It came today what's disappointing is that the battery wasn't included and the left support that holds the glasses broke they should really improve on the packaging if only we could get a new one
2.0,Went by the chart and still recieved a pair thats a bit big. Material seems a bit cheap as well.
2.0,I love the look of these brackets but they are extremely fragile.
2.0,I bought these and the first day my daughter wore the outfit the iron on vinyl came off!
2.0,"This dress kept falling below my daughter's chest. The shape/size fit her perfectly, but after just a few minutes of moving around, no matter how tightly it was tied or how scrunched (or not) the chest area was, it just wouldn't stay up.  The halter strap pulls from beneath the chest area and it ended up being a huge design flaw."
2.0,SMALL AND THE COLOR LOOKS FADED
2.0,"Looks cool, arm holes are huge, sleeves are a tad short but I'm taller than avg so that's debatable."
2.0,I love it but it had a whole on seam üò´
2.0,The stones fell out pretty quickly :/
2.0,You get what you pay for. Beads started coming loose right away and underneath the fabric was all of the stitches- they didn‚Äôt even add a backing which... I mean.. would help the beads from coming undone. Sent it back and honestly going to try and make something instead.
2.0,"Did not fit at all, ordered it for a child's birthday present. I had to add two inches of material,  literally had to make the cap over to make it fit. It was not as described NBA advertisement."
2.0,The gloves do not hold up for my use. I use disposable gloves when I prepare my food. This was the first time I ordered from this vendor. I have used similar gloves from another vendor but they were out of stock. Every 4th or so glove came out of the box already torn. After very little use the glove would tear especially at the tip pf my fingers. The gloves seem to be a bit thinner than the others I have purchased. I will not be buying any more. I have lost 25% due to poor quality.
2.0,This was a gift for my granddaughter.  It ran really small.  Almost too small.
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress.  Going to go on vacation and need an evening outfit.<br /> I wear a 38 DDD  And ordered a size 12.  (My normal pant/ dress size) the body of the dress fit fine, nice  Stretch.  the area covering my breast did not fit at all.  I liked the stretchy thin straps they probly do not offer a lot of support for someone with natural breasts."
2.0,Loved the style and color. Only downfall is that it feels and sounds like a percale bed sheet.
2.0,"The image on the product description is not accurate. It isn't that long, its not a sweater either, its of very cheap material with lose threads around. Looks cheap ( so is the price so not complaining there), not as good as on the picture. Will let my daughter try it and if she doesn't like it will return it."
2.0,Too small to fit
2.0,"Cute designs but very cheap metal, that was expected though. We were disappointed because they are very small. Only a few fit my daughters tiny hands. Definitely not a size 7, closer to maybe a 4 or 5."
2.0,I recommend sizing up. It's tulle not lace and the quality is as expected for the price.
2.0,"You can't read it, even with the magnifying glass."
2.0,"You get what you‚Äôll pay for, I ordered a small and definitely received an ill fitting large"
2.0,Too short and even for small busted women the neckline is too low and loose.
2.0,The sweater was actually Red not Marion. The draw strings where maroon. All together my daughter likes it and that‚Äôs what matters.
2.0,It had a hole in it
2.0,This is a waist of money
2.0,"so disappointed. i got this pair of boots a month ago, i liked it. wore it for 3 or 4 timezs,the lining broke. I am not sure if it was broke in the beginning because I never checked. :( it shouldn't be broke after 3 4 times wear anyways..not sure if they let me return it. :("
2.0,The colour was much lighter. Completely different than the picture. Disappointing.
2.0,I thought colors on side did not match front
2.0,I was so excited but was so disappointed.  I ordered a size up and they were still tight.  They were also ask see through when bending. The material was thin.
2.0,bought this for my daugther... she loves them but i bought it too big
2.0,"I loved these underwear. Always wore boxers, but these help with moisture buildup that can lead to chafing. I liked them so much I bought some more, but after washing one of the new pack it seemed to fall apart at the seam."
2.0,I bought this anklet and within days the little metal balls on the ends of the dangly things fell off on over half of them and overall the anklet looks cheap
2.0,"Stitching is poor and came to me weak; threads coming apart after only one or two uses, and I'm not even rough with it. Also, the ear straps aren't attached evenly. One side is like an inch longer, but with the adjusters it works ok. However, but my left ear has no room for adjustment as it's at the edge of the strap. It should have been made an inch longer to match the other side and to give room to adjust it. I'm afraid it'll fall off any moment. Plus having one an inch longer on one side looks weird."
2.0,"Cute glasses and lots of compliments. Unfortunately, didn't last more than 2 weeks of lifeguard use. The idea that the ear pieces can be changed out is great; however the nub that holds them in place wore down too quickly and the right side wouldn't stay on - the top of the nub was nearly flat. A little 2 part epoxy revived the nub and all was good for another week, and then they fell off the kitchen counter and the frame split right under the lense. Won't buy again. (Maybe material of the frosted white frame is poor quality and others are ok.)"
2.0,This watch set is very nice looking. The down fall to this set is that they run very small as they are made in China.  My wrist circumference is 6.5 and the fit is very tight and umcomfortable.
2.0,"xs was way too small for me.  I am 5'2"" and 106 lbs.  Legs and arms were so tight I could barely get them on.  I have worn wetsuits in the past and know its supposed to be tight but not to the point of cutting off circulation.  Will be returning."
2.0,"This product did not look as pictured.  I didn't bother to return it because it was more trouble than it was worth.  Rough soldering, looked like what it cost vs as pictured."
2.0,"Chain is very light duty.  &#34;If&#34; you have children, and one grabs is while you are wearing it.  Th e chain will break.  Not the quality I expected."
2.0,"WAAAAY too big to be a nose ring, the hoop looked ridiculous! Would have been awesome if it was the right size"
2.0,"I knew they were cheap, but not that cheap... Should've gotten better quality glasses."
2.0,"The top was see through and loose, if I lifted my arms I‚Äôd be fully exposed. The bottoms were an odd length and saggy in the front. Less than ideal"
2.0,Unfortunately they pulled after one wear and very snaggable! Very comfortable but not the legging you get to look good and feel good in when you are dressing up.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this hat because it seemed like it could be useful for summer runs and camping, but one very important detail is missing that renders it pretty useless. The pictures show a snap near the chin area for the side flaps so that they won‚Äôt fly backwards, but the hat I received didn‚Äôt have one. The material is very light, so even walking through my house where there is no wind, they were flapping backwards away from my face- you know, the part that I want covered from the sun. Between that and the fact that the stitching seemed weak and the material was already fraying on the inside of the hat, I sent it back. I had planned to be sweating in it and throwing it in the washing machine frequently, so even if it had the snap near the chin, I don‚Äôt think it would have held up for my purposes."
2.0,I loved it but the second day I had it the headband started messing up
2.0,"Fits fine, looks fine, the wrinkle resistant statement is a fantasy. It came out of the package wrinkled, then came out of the dryer wrinkled. My standard dickies shirts are less wrinkled."
2.0,"Very thin, easily breaks through, poor protection and loose fitting. Will not purchase again."
2.0,Cute but came smaller than I thought and no phone pocket
2.0,"It's pretty, but not reliable. The fact always pops off and the band is not reliable üòí"
2.0,didn't like material.
2.0,"I like the idea/style of this dress, but the fabric was pretty thin. I am about 5'5&#34;, 140lbs and ordered a Medium, it fit fine, just didn't flatter my body shape. The skirt began at my hips rather than my waist."
2.0,Cute but posts wore down to brass within a couple of weeks.
2.0,The anchor is cute but much too large for any ear.  Wish I had seen a picture of it in context. Would definitely not have purchased it. Had previously purchased a couple others from juju beads and am very happy with them.
2.0,i don't like it at all
2.0,Nice dress but shorter than shown.  Returned for a refund.
2.0,Runs VERY SMALL -returning it
2.0,Straps broke and leather is peeling.  Not pleased with this item.
2.0,Very poorly constructed.  A true disappointment
2.0,"credit cards are too difficult to insert & remove, especially for people with arthritis. had to return wallet for a refund."
2.0,"I like the style but it was made poorly. It had a lot of threads hanging, the string in the hood was pulled through and the sleeves are NOT full length"
2.0,very tiny & don't see it glowing in the dark
2.0,Finally showed up after 2 days of saying it was already delivered . Also its a light weight metal very easily bendable wish it was a fabric mask guess I didn't look at material
2.0,inexpensive for a reason........
2.0,material is horrible. giving 2 stars because it did fit on my pregnant belly.
2.0,Black coating came off shortly after purchase
2.0,The &#34;pearl&#34; feels fake.
2.0,"I would love to give this five stars as it appears to be a very sturdy mask, however there are splatters of what look like plastic drips all over the mask which would require a lot of sanding to even try to smooth the mask out. It also looks like it got ‚Äútoo hot‚Äù at one point and it has a melted rippling look to it around the chin, mouth and nose area. The edges of the mask look like they were sawed off and have sharp edges. All in all this mask looks like it should have been tossed in the trash, not sold to someone looking for a sturdy, well designed human appearing face. This may just be a ‚Äúbad‚Äù mask but to even sell it says something about the company manufacturing and selling these masks on Amazon. In regards to the other review with the five stars‚Ä¶..the mask you had photos was NOT the mask I ordered and yes I am aware it is a DIY mask but that does not excuse poor products,"
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture.  The collar is much smaller - the feature I was most excited about - and it apparently runs very small
2.0,It was blue and black and white . Picture looked black and white . I hate blue and black combination
2.0,"Bought this for going to the beach.  The bag is SO big that it's too lunky to really wear and use.  It will carry a lot of stuff.  The zip pouch on the front only zips one way and if you leave it slightly open, everything will fall out.  The water bottle pouch tie wouldn't stay closed.  The zip pouch on the inside was easy to use and worked well for phone, money, etc."
2.0,"Runs really small in the arms and across the chest. Ordered a large, still waiting to see if that will fit? The leather is very soft though."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like the material made me scratch!
2.0,The piece of jewelry in the middle is not a Diamond or atleast a fake Diamond it looks like a ball of paste with rhinestones
2.0,"These bras are smaller than what they are listed as. I wear a 44C. I've worn a 44C for years. I bought a 44C and the cups were not a C cup. At least not the cup size I am used to. They were small. If I had to guess, I'd say they were the size of a B cup. They are comfortable around...but what's the point if they are too small to wear to begin with?"
2.0,Good quality but wayyyy too small!
2.0,"I like them however there not for plastic frames the thick plastic clamp won‚Äôt allow the sunglasses area to fit over all of the lens so its not good it fits over metal frames perfectly but not plastic, had to return it."
2.0,Very poor quality. Sent them back.
2.0,They're very very cute but the back of one of the earrings is broken. I opened them and the earring back fell right off and the part that goes through your ear is broken. Not very pleased because you can not even wear them.
2.0,"These are literally needles with two rounded caps on each end. They snap open fairly easy, so they don‚Äôt hold the garment for long."
2.0,These gloves fit my grandbaby like bags and fell off. That would've been acceptable if there had been decent elastic or stretch around the wrists. The quality of the material was poor as well. I returned them.
2.0,Length and arm length are super short on the larges. Fits everywhere else but way to short in the arms.
2.0,Looks good in. Falls out easily and is thick and hard to put in. Wouldn't recommend.
2.0,"Unfortunately, they didn't fit my Maui Jim sunglasses!  Incredibly, disappointed!  The ends need to be made so that they can fit MAUI JIM‚Äôs (yours are way too small)"
2.0,"The dress was listed as a woman's extra large, but by no means was it. It was more like the size for a girl. The cape did fit properly."
2.0,"I must not have paid attention to the description.  It is pretty enough but is a very LARGE cross that could be worn by a large man or woman, a rap star, a performer....... I bought it for a small child to wear at her private school.  Its almost comical.  We didn't send it back.  She might be able to wear it with the right Halloween costume.  Would have looked nice on &#34;John&#34; in the move Green Mile!!!"
2.0,"I really really liked this purse. I liked the size, I liked the style, I liked the color, the dimensions being wider than deeper, the design of the interior pockets........Unfortunately, it has not lasted long which makes me appreciate that the price was so low. But you get what you pay for. I have had purses lasted years that I didn't pay much more for. It has only been a few months and the connectors on the purse for the long strap have both broken. Which, ok, was fine, I really like a long strap but I could still use the short handles. But now today the main zipper has broken and won't close, the zip is off track. Then, when I finally get it closed, I can't get it open. I am very easy on purses. I guess if you like the size and style, this would be good for an occasional purse, but it can't handle daily duties."
2.0,"I am very disappointed in this product.this product fell apart at the seams on the fingers within the first week of use. For the amount I spent on these gloves, I expected a lot more out of them.<br /><br />Mike s."
2.0,"Not long after I started wearing them, the sole started leaving tiny black bits on my floors. It didn't happen on my wood floors, but on the slightly stickier surface of my kitchen and bathroom, where it also left a lot of scuff marks. These slippers were comfortable, but I had to throw them away."
2.0,"sizing is absurd--30 inch belt was at least 3 inches shorter than the 32, making it too small for me, a person who normally wears 29 inch pants. other than that, fine product."
2.0,"it is definitely not girl's size, it is too wide for my arm and the lock broke at the same day"
2.0,"Poor quality, not true to size at all. I bought up a size and it still was too small. Don't buy. Only reason I didn't return it is because it was not worth the effort since it was inexpensive.  I gave it away."
2.0,"One of the 'ribs' broke after the first day of use. There was also a sharp wire that caused a cut on my finger. Of course, it has been 2 months since I purchased this, and it was not used until after the warranty period that I discovered the above.  Very disappointed in this purchase and too late to ask for a replacement or money back."
2.0,Pants are cheaply made they don‚Äôt stay up the waist is way to big if I lose weight they will fall off z I don‚Äôt like the pants the tops okay but runs small these are made in China and it took about a month to receive
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:30de011f86929977af659c062c716e49]] Surprisingly given some of the other reviews here, the charger I received seems solidly built, with the prongs providing a satisfying ""snap"" when opened or closed. And as a slight bonus, the blue colour makes it easy to locate in a bag amongst other electronics.<br /><br />Sadly, despite the description stating that this charger supports USB-C PD, it doesn't fast charge my USB-C PD compatible Note 10 Plus; indeed it charges even slower than the 25W charger that came with the phone."
2.0,"They worked at the begining but after my first ride I felt them too loose,,, I guess it was because I washed them off??"
2.0,"This mask is soft, has a pretty print and I like the adjusters. It is definitely not breathable. I felt very claustrophobic. It is also huge. I wouldn‚Äôt say I have a small face, but this was enormous."
2.0,Top is beautiful but would have rather had full bottom instead of thong
2.0,Pin was great and as described.  The yellow wrist-bands deteriorated quickly and broke within a few weeks.
2.0,"Four pleated ends/corners stick up. Size is fine but loose against cheeks. Great patterns, great material, needs to have better control on the corners to stay against face. My suggestion would be to have elastic go inside through material like curtain rod."
2.0,Not as pictured at all. But kept it because I can still put it to use but wouldn't buy this print again thee other one I bought from the same company was great!
2.0,The earring came without the backing attached Pretty but not worth it
2.0,"Good idea but poorly made, fell apart"
2.0,Was adorable until I realized it came with a broken leg :(
2.0,Love the cut and style. I had so many compliments till all the buttons fell off by the end of the day. It should be a great apron because it is sturdy and color safe. I wish I could have given a better review but now I need to fix it.
2.0,"It was stiff material.  Not soft at all, and lightweight for a robe."
2.0,"I really wanted to like these native flats. They are decently comfortable, affordable, and a chic option to wear in the rain. However, after a few months of daily wear and tear the material started to break down and to smell! I started to wash them before I wore them each day and spray the inside with essential oils, but nothing seemed to work. I think the material is just porous and absorbs sweat really well. Thus leaving you with stinky shoes. Maybe your feet don't sweat that much and you still want to give them a try. I would suggest ordering a size down."
2.0,It was too small and very thin material
2.0,"They didn't use normal jibbit backs so they stick up amd are difficult to attach and fall out constantly, charms are very thin in comparison to others I've purchased."
2.0,Order 2x reg size if you want to wear these. Very skimpy on size. Really need to give to a smaller friend.
2.0,"the ""size chart"" for this item is incorrect.<br /><br />This garment is NOT true to size, runs Small.<br /><br />I ordered 1 size up (an XL vs a L), for a loose  fit.<br /><br />NO LOOSE FIT HERE.<br /><br />Goodwill donation.<br /><br />Material is very soft, garment is well made - all edges are finished,button holes are the right sizes and stitched correctly, pocket is lined well, piping is perfect. collar is attached and lays well."
2.0,I had been looking forward to this colorful bracelet.  Unfortunately what I received was a brown (light and dark) assortment of tiger eye beads.  I won‚Äôt bother to send it back but had been looking forward to an assortment of colors as shown in the picture.
2.0,The fabric of this gown was so thin I could not wear it. It was very see through. Disappointed.
2.0,Didnt strech much
2.0,"This keychain is super cute and I love the design on it. However, what I got in the mail isn‚Äôt like the pictures. In the pictures, the gold one, looks red with a gold stem. But when I got it, it was orange with a gold stem. If I could‚Äôve gotten the keychain that was in the pictures, I would‚Äôve given it five stars."
2.0,sleeves were short and the bottom hem did not keep its shape
2.0,Very thin. Chain broke as soon as I took it out the package and stood in front of the mirror with NOTHING inside of it.
2.0,"I thought this was like the other watch bands advertised on Amazon showing an incorrect picture but being EXACTLY like the OEM apple bands when received. This band is ACTUALLY reversed from the Apple design, exactly as depicted in the photo - The tab sticks OUT of this watch band and catches on everything - It comes undone constantly on my wrist, and is NOT XL in size - Its about the same net size as the regular Apple M/L set bands...<br /><br />I was so excited that someone finally made an XL band in more than just Black and for less than $50 - Too good to be true."
2.0,I had to send these back.  The bottoms HUGE and the top ok but not as loose as I prefer.  It was just all a wierd fit and the bottoms hysterically HUGE!
2.0,"Eh.... material isn‚Äôt very stretchy, seams sit in weird places. I‚Äôm returning mine."
2.0,cheap flimsy made in china glasses
2.0,Not really like the photo....cheap . Color was exact. The tie belt is not a tie its just two strings in the front you tie in a bow.
2.0,"Too small, was absolutely not sized right. I bought a size 20 just to be safe, as I normally wear a 16, and the top fit like a size 8."
2.0,"Started falling apart after a week, purchased something else after a couple weeks as it was unusable to hold cards once it started falling apart with light use."
2.0,"I like the shoe, but it is way too large and wide.  Definitly NOT an 8.  It's at least a 9, falls off my feet.  I have a closetful of number 8 Sketchers that fit fine, and I always buy them on-line without trying them on.  Something is wrong with this one!  I returned it for a refund, which is a shame because I love the shoe and wanted to wear it."
2.0,CHEAP !!!  Came broken
2.0,I am usually a medium in high waisted jeans but i went off the measurements given and decided to try an XL. They were still too small. Pay extra close attention to sizing chart before buying as there is no give in the jeans.
2.0,"Sock Material: Very thick for a sock.  It‚Äôs like wearing a sweater on your feet.  I live in Florida and find the material thickness just too heavy.  The material thickness might be appreciated in cold climates.<br /><br />Fit: Uncomfortable.  I wear a size 10 shoe.  So I ordered the L/xL size.  When I first put the socks on, my first impression was that they fit properly.  But the socks continually seem to move around and stretch off my foot.  After about one hour the socks ‚Äúelongate‚Äù and I find that I have about 1/2 inch of material hanging over my toes.  At that point they are disturbing and uncomfortable to wear.  The only solution is to take the socks completely off and put them back on again.  But one hour later, I again have material hanging off my toes."
2.0,I had to return it because it looked like a bathrobe.
2.0,Too long in the crotch. Went back.
2.0,Dislike the fit dress is so cute.
2.0,The shape and color are great.  The card slots are too small and very difficult  to use.
2.0,Material is extremely thin.  Will send it back for a refund.
2.0,Fuzzy looking through these glasses.  Plastic lense.  Style is cute unfortunately not usable
2.0,No long enough. Rides up when moving around
2.0,I like these pants but they have a snap instead of a button so they come unsnapped when you kneel or trying to climb.
2.0,Really nice design but definitely not 100% cotton - it has synthetics blended in you can feel it
2.0,"Title says most of it.  The style is really retro, but that is personal taste.  Kind of a ZZ Top look.<br /><br />Look the nerd, be the nerd.<br /><br />Added:  These aint rinestone shades.  These have actually held up pretty well considering my handing. Ususally I lose them before they break anyway.  One of my neices loves the look of them, except for the bifocal, but she wears them anyway.  Quoting ZZ Top: &#34;What really knocked me out was the cheap sunglasses&#34;.  They have the look and I like it.<br /><br />Edited:  I really do like to the look and feel. Unfortunately these are really fragile.  I have had a couple pf pairs and they all broke in the same spot.  My last pair just broke and I will be looking for something similar by another manufacturer. I really can't recommend based on the fragility."
2.0,"The shorts run really small, like 2 sizes too small, I wear a 16 and got XL's...not even close.  Also, the pocket does not fit my Iphone 6S very well.  An IPhone 6S is not a very big phone and it's kind of stupid to make such a small pocket.  Don't spend your money."
2.0,"Super cute dress and received many compliments but was only able to wear it once. The first time I wore it, it was to a friends wedding and the seam on one side completely tore/shredded by the end of the night. Wedding was only a couple of hours and the dress couldn‚Äôt even last. Good thing the dress was only $12 bucks!"
2.0,"After 2 years something, this belt is done. Won't stay closed anymore. Little movement and buckle opens up, makes your pants slip down."
2.0,I thought it was the original. I have seen it so I have the comparison. Sorry.  We can use it though. It could be worse.
2.0,Lovely print but concerned about weight for proper  Face covering protection. Definitely not heavy enough for a winter day if looking for that type of protection.
2.0,"A lot of issues with this order.<br />1) I ordered ""color 4"" thinking it was black but it's not. It's more like very dark brown. It looks black but when you wear it with black clothes then it becomes obvious that it's dark brown.<br />2) The ratchet slips constantly. Imagine walking down the street and the buckle releases the belt. That's what happened to me! I constant have to push the belt back in to hold up my pants but a few moments later ... the ratchet slips again!<br /><br />This is my 8th ratchet belt and this is the first one that has this issue."
2.0,"I ordered these, I do not like the material, it does not breathe. My calf‚Äôs and feet were sweaty, almost like I had them wrapped in plastic in my shoe."
2.0,"Nothing special. Yes, the patterns are pretty, but after 2 washes they have holes. The size in the description says one size fits all, but the tag says size medium. ?? Was planning on returning the three pairs I purchased, but ran out of time. The $30 I spent could have bought me a nice pair. Best advice quality over quantity! Sure you can spend less, but be prepared for holes and thin material. Better off purchasing other ones."
2.0,"As far as durability, it seems the clasps and everything would hold up. The face bumper it comes with matches. However, the color is extremely yellow. I‚Äôm returning for that reason. But if color doesn‚Äôt seem to bother you then I would recommend."
2.0,"Looks great, but to thick to work on Chevy or Honda keys. Gets stuck in the key opening an did not allow keys to hang freely. Bummer. Returning üò¢"
2.0,It ripped apart first day of use.
2.0,"They look good, but they are itchy.  Thought maybe it would get better after a few washes, but it didn't."
2.0,"Cute but sized wrong. Ordered xl, fit like s/manager. Had to return."
2.0,Its ok and it seriously chokes you
2.0,"I had to return this due to a defect in the shoulder seam, as well as it being a good deal larger than my previous sweater also a russell medium,  as with all amazon purchases there was no hassle with the return/exchange and hope i can give a better review when i receive this in a small."
2.0,sadly i love the design but i can't with the material. It feels so cheap and for the price i dont think its worth it. sadly going back :/
2.0,Cheaper quality than I expected. A bit disappointed
2.0,"I should have heeded the warnings - product definitely runs small.  I wear a 12-14 Misses in most blouses and knowing that the description and reviews indicated this ran very small, I bought the XXL.  Still too small.  Fabric is extremely thin so I doubt it will wear long.  But for the price (&#60;$5 and free shipping) there was no risk in trying.  Might make a good gift for one of my smaller female friends!"
2.0,"Ran small, button closures are a joke and don't actually hold dress shut unless it's way oversized, see through, and a poorly attached waist string... but beautiful cut and fit overall."
2.0,"Pretty to look at, not great to wear.  Hangs on everything"
2.0,"While this ""skirt"" is super cute, I would not have paid $15 for it if I had known it was basically a stretchy tube top."
2.0,The glasses are very cute however they are totally flat. With no curve to fit them to your face the inside of the glasses catches a reflection which make it difficult to see through.
2.0,It does not fit properly
2.0,"The dial is very hard to read.  Too much gold without contrast. looks great as an object of jewelery (bracelet) and looks intriguing, but as a watch, I have to pass on it.  As long as you have a clock on your phone, you can wear it for its good looks.  The mechanics work well and it keeps time.  I bought it because it is fully mechanical and self-winding which is a dying art."
2.0,I do not  care for  this Fitbit band.  It has discolored and no  longer matches well  with my Fitbit.
2.0,"Hat is nice, but didn‚Äôt come with face shield. The face shield was the entire reason I bought this hat."
2.0,"I usually wear a 1x , I bought a 3x and it is tight, the material is soft and strechable so I am keeping it."
2.0,"Too big, ordered a small, still too large. Im 5'3, 130 lbs. super thing fabric and you can  see the fold over part at the top, returning."
2.0,The Yesno Casual Loose Fit Unique Skirt Patch work runs small I am between size 10 and 12 to tight and you do not get the full look like on the model very disappointed.
2.0,Not worth 14 dollars at all. Very small and cheap looking. Only giving two stars because I like the print
2.0,"Although the product is sturdy, and the frames are really cool they were sadly crooked and I am unable to wear them, I‚Äôm sure I just got a bad pair but regardless it sucks"
2.0,Pretty color but to big for me.  Did receive it quickly
2.0,This looks like a cool contraption! Sadly it doesn't work like it looks like it should üò•
2.0,material is very thin and unsupportive
2.0,"The shoe is a very nice shoe. Unfortunately, it's not comforting because of the top lining of both shoes. They are scrapping my daughter's feet to the point where they both get red. I checked the shoe and what I see is that the sewing/stitching is what is wrong and is causing the issue. I'm unable to return because she wore it to a party Friday. I am disappointed because the shoe is lovely otherwise, sole is very cushiony."
2.0,It was not really what I was expecting and the material is really rough and it‚Äôs not very comfortable
2.0,"The dress was really, really cute and I loved the style. Unfortunately there is NO elasticity in the chest area which doesn‚Äôt make fit a comfortable fit."
2.0,"It is nothing like the picture, I am very upset"
2.0,"2 out of the 3 pairs have a weird effect when looking out the sides of the glasses as if it is bubbled. They still work, but definitely not the quality you would want."
2.0,Pictures are stolen from vicci dolls and white fox boutique. The leopard print looks different from photos when you receive it. Material is like a shiny neoprene fabric. Returned.
2.0,Unhappy because of the week that was on the waistband but not shown in the product photos
2.0,Did not fit off shoulder.  Regular T-shirt
2.0,"I do like the style and design. This dress runs small. I don‚Äôt have big arms, but the arms are too small. I will be returning."
2.0,Ordered the cap in picture. Got a Miami Marlins cap instead
2.0,"It's a good tie, but I needed navy & pink & this is definitely not navy.....It's purple!"
2.0,"These are great when they're brand new out of the package. After about 4 weeks of daily wear 8-9 hours a day they start to pop off. This is the third pie I've bought and unless they have a good answer I won't be buying anymore. The straps seem to get stretched out as well as these aren't the best for someone over 6'. I'm 6'2&#34; and these barely fit height wise, I'd recommend something else if you're a tall person."
2.0,I took the tie clip out and it started bending<br />It felt like aluminum foil
2.0,"I ordered this hat hoping to get a stiff-brimmed sun hat that wouldn't blow around.  This one ain't it.  It doesn't really say this anywhere in the description, so anyone looking at this hat should know that it's another floppy brimmed, mushy mess.  I tried starching the thing to make it wearable, and even that wouldn't give the brim any shape.  Not sure what it's actually made of but whatever it is would not take starch so I suspect it's not natural fibers...<br /><br />If you're looking for a very floppy sun hat, order this one.  If you want a structured brim, forget about it."
2.0,Product description states for girls and they are large and heavy
2.0,"Too small, I have to return them."
2.0,I was so excited for these. Not sure why they decided to mail me incomplete earrings. Pretty sure the picture shows two bears on 1 earring each. Ordered a replacement. Returning.
2.0,"So I've ordered these a couple times now... & sadely have returned a few pairs... either they sent the wrong color, one fit way off! Ordered small but it looked like idk maybe a large! They looked huge lol & then another pair I ordered came & the hem on the bottom inside was open! I coulda easily gave that to my mother-in-law to fix but it woulda taken so long! And I wanted to wear them now! My cousin really loves the ones I kept & would steal them from me to wear but she's a size bigger... so I will attempt to order 1 more time! & really hope all works out! Lol ü§ûüèº maybe I'm nuts but it's not difficult to return and get a refund so why not try. But if it's another bust I'm afraid I won't be ordering again. She adores mine so I hope I can get her a few colors for her birthday next month!!<br /><br />Edit! I ordered a bigger size & the fit was to tight so I compared to another pair I already had & it was a small when shoulda been a medium!  Labeled was medium! But size is all wrong!  I'm so Over buying and returning and trying again and again only to be disappointed!  üòû"
2.0,Beads fell off before I wore it.
2.0,"Curved lenses, was told they were flat. Could not use them."
2.0,I did not like this product. I expected something better.
2.0,It was way too big. Nothing fit. Even the neck area to put off the shoulder was too small. Even a small would‚Äôve have done justice.
2.0,"This shirt is not my favorite. Looks super adorable on the model, but the shirt is not the same one I got in the mail.<br /><br />The model looks like she's wearing an cute oversized sweater/shirt with cute lace on top... Definitely similar to what I got except for the fact that it looks like a small t-shirt that got the top part cut off and lace sewn on to the top.  The lace part kept rolling up as the day went on. Also, if you have anything bigger then a C, don't get this top. It won't fit that part."
2.0,I love the idea of this wallet but.... Seems plastic-y and feels cheap. First time I opened it the blue edging stuck to itself and came off.
2.0,The pants are out of proportion to the clothes. The pants are big
2.0,Bought this for my mother for her birthday and it started tarnishing. Not happy at all about it.
2.0,strap was twisted
2.0,This Blazer Sucked It Was NOT What Was Advertised On The Website It Definitely Is Not A Slim Fit
2.0,I did not know the product was mesh like in its fabric. I thought it was going to be a solid material and I‚Äôm honestly pretty disappointed about that. I would not have made the purchase if I knew that. It‚Äôs quite difficult to see in the pictures posted. Just feel sad about it.
2.0,It was cute but it fell apart and turned green way too fast.<br />I wish it was just better quality.
2.0,Length is great for a long tunic. Fit is really strange and just isn't flattering. Neck is too high.  Fabric is kind of thin and cheap. I don't know... I will wear it around the house I guess.
2.0,"Fabric not too great, looks like one wash and that was it: I need to return this order."
2.0,"Product went out on me after a year , warranty was out so I need to replace on my own."
2.0,Really really cute jeans for my 13 yr old daughter But the day that she put them on to wear them for the first time the button broke off so she hasn‚Äôt been able to wear them. Big disappointment hopefully it was just a fluke.
2.0,We ordered a 2XL and the shirt that came had the 2XL tag but was not a true 2XL.
2.0,Very cheap and fragile the charms keep breaking off
2.0,Made ok...but to small
2.0,The belt looks wider on the picture than it actually is. I kept it because I may use it in the future.
2.0,"Nice Mask, but do not get it for snowboarding, skiing! It‚Äôs really thin so it won‚Äôt keep you warm"
2.0,The color of this shirt is not what I expected. Not a color I would have ordered for myself.
2.0,"Love the coat. But to small. Had to send coat back. Arms to tight and midsection to tight. Ordered size Large, is what I wear. It was to small. Sent it back ordered the XL, but it was as tight as the Large. If they had larger sizes I would have ordered them."
2.0,"The material is very thin and see through, and not good quality. It is not good for the price, but it is the same style as the picture shows. The top part is definitely not long enough to cover you if you have any sort of a bust."
2.0,Cheap flimsy material. Returned.
2.0,I only gave this 2 stars because i love the material and theyre so soft and i love this pink but they look nothing like the picture. Theyre longer shorts almost like bike riding shorts. The sides arent cinched as pictured either.
2.0,"This material was so thin and flimsy!!! And the seams needed to be re-sown, there were threads everywhere."
2.0,The shoes work fine and I have not use the pedal ( I already have pedals for my spin bike) The rear part of the shoe the part under the heel peeled away after 1 day of having them. I only wore them in the carpeted room in my home and never walked in them more the 10 feet.  I have not returned them because don't want to deal with the hassle.
2.0,They are super soft mittens and would be adorable but the owls do not have eyes like shown in the picture and so it doesn't look like owls.
2.0,The clasp continuously slipped off glasses.  Did not work for me.
2.0,Was bigger than expected
2.0,Watch seemed way to big for a boys size.  Had intentions of giving this to my 7-year old son but it would have been huge on his wrist.
2.0,"Great material, but needed to re-stitch to make tighter as it just fell off my nose."
2.0,"Not case friendly as listed, not very clear. Adhesive didn't stick well. I'm really disappointed in this product. Go ahead and spend a few more bucks for a screen protector that functions properly."
2.0,I do not recommend these
2.0,"This company is the absolute worst to deal with,  and I have yet to get anyone on the the phone.  The goggles are great,  but I will not go through the hassle of ordering any additional pairs."
2.0,"I LOVE these bows, but every time my daughter has worn one, the middle loop comes undone.  I'm so disappointed.  I guess I'll have to try my hot glue gun to get them to hold."
2.0,But The Straps fall off my shoulders & are always coming unhooked in back<br />Disappointed because<br />I am getting compliments on it every day
2.0,the back looks nice but the front will not work well for my daughter. i have returned it
2.0,The top is short in length. Great if you have a hour shape not so great on other shapes
2.0,Fur falling off the material!
2.0,Looks cool but rubber band breaks easily.
2.0,"Upon initially receiving this, I was in love with it. I loved the color and the design. After wearing it for only a couple weeks though, the rose gold plating was already starting to wear off and looked dull and tarnished. I did not wear it to the pool or beach, but I did leave it on when I showered. If you purchase this, I would recommend that you take it off to polish it every day. This is not one of those anklets that you can just leave on day and night. :("
2.0,"As mentioned by others, not quite good enough. There's not enough elasticity, and the back side is too short."
2.0,I disliked that it snagged on everything
2.0,Didn't like the material- it's shiny and thin. The length is shorter than the picture and more of a flare than shown. I'll be returning them or giving them away.
2.0,"The two stars is because it is very pretty and looks just like the picture BUT it is fantasy jewelry, not 925 silver and it turned my daughters finger green in just one day of wearing it."
2.0,They did not fit my boyfriend (men's size 11.5) so now they are mine.
2.0,Totally cute.. For kids or people with pencil thin necks. Unfortunately for people with shorter necks or ogre necks this is literally a toy...
2.0,"This is more for teenagers, though listed in women's. Not for curvy women. It is super fitting even though I bought a size up and is not as long as stated. Was pretty in person though."
2.0,Not great styling or shaping.
2.0,"I got their XL and it is SUPER small.  I am not a plus sized woman.  I wear a 34DD and the cups were tiny.  I have 41&#34; hips and 27&#34; waist and it was WAY too small for my hips, and they didn't cover my butt.  I am built a little different than most women, though, so for someone who is a little less curvy than me, it would fit; however, go larger in size as it runs extremely small."
2.0,Nice Quality but the size was not close.  VERY small.  Ordered XL and band barely stretched to 32&#34;.
2.0,"I've bought better sunglasses for $5. I don't write reviews on many things I buy, but I wanted to make sure prospective buyers were aware: most of the reviews on this item are faked. All of the faked ones are 5 stars. Read them. If you are a native English speaker, it will be obvious. I wish I had paid closer attention to them.<br /><br />Now, to the actual product review. The extras (hard case, cleaning cloth, soft case) are nice but they don't make up for the poor quality of the glasses. They are cheap plastic, on the tight side, and most importantly, DON'T DECREASE SUNLIGHT. If anything, these make the scene brighter. I purchased SUNGLASSES to wear on SUNNY days. My eyes are easily visible when wearing these. These MAY be good for night time driving. However, I will not take the risk with these sunglasses because I'm afraid they may not hold up to their much more important claims of being UV-blocking."
2.0,This billfold is so small you can hardly get anything in it.
2.0,"VERY CUTE,BUT THERE IS NO LINING SO IT IS VERY SCRATCHY"
2.0,couldn't even get it on well enough to stand. Returning this item.
2.0,I always order a size larger for compression gear so this fits as expected.  I did not like the seam placement on these.  The seams rubbed me in the wrong places.
2.0,"Look great. Very sturdy material. Shoes appear to be well made. However, my son has worn them for 3 weeks and the lights already don't work. At least with other brands the lights last the couple of months that he's able to wear them before they start falling apart."
2.0,The shirt broke the first time I put it on.
2.0,Loved the shirt did not like the shorts.
2.0,I wish that it had a little more bling to it..in the pictures it seems more glam than it is in person..
2.0,Lenses are larger than described.
2.0,"Won‚Äôt stay on my face because one of the legs seems to have been bent or something,<br />Not clear at all, I got the medium and they‚Äôre still pretty big but I‚Äôm not upset about that just that they won‚Äôt rest on my face"
2.0,Material thin and not a good quality.  This fit every part of your body...just does not look like a quality piece of clothing
2.0,"Shipping was fairly quick and packaging was good.  One of the function buttons fell off in the box.  Overall the watch's quality seems ok but it is a $29.00 watch.  Couldn't get the button to stay on, so the watch has been returned."
2.0,Chain to long and not exactly to<br />Quality I was hoping for
2.0,"Junk - terrible - not well made, eye shields are wrinkled and cloudy."
2.0,The pictures are just for you to buy it
2.0,"Disappointing. The top of the bra will not stay up without straps. It's not even that it &#34;sags,&#34; more like it's permanently bent and keeps trying to fold itself in half horizontally. The loops for the straps are way too close together so that the strap wraps around my arm rather than going over the shoulder. Also, the straps I received were odd. I received 3 nude colored straps that seemed about the right length, and 2 clear ones that were several inches shorter and unusable. The bra might have been salvageable if I could have used the clear straps, but as it is, it's worthless."
2.0,"too small, didn't like material, not as pic"
2.0,Would not buy if you are taller or have a large butt. The top part is nice. This looks more like a top than a dress on me. I am 5‚Äô 7‚Äù for reference.  If I move my legs at all I am showing all my goodies. This needs more fabric in the front.
2.0,"The straps were too tight and not flexible enough. I felt I was going to endure too many blisters before breaking them in so I returned them. Cute design and quality looked nice, though."
2.0,Cloak is nice but but everything thing else was very tight
2.0,Suuuuper Cheap.
2.0,Not a synthetic material. Should had read more before I bought. No band at the back to keep tight while riding a motorcycle. Bought 4. Will use them but not my favorite for sure.
2.0,"I am 5ft, 125lbs athletic build and I ordered a medium but should've ordered a Small. The medium fit pretty loose, top was super baggy and almost coming off my shoulders. I didn't replace with a small because the design of the top is just weird. The ""scrunch"" is diagonally across the top instead of down the middle, which makes it looks really weird. Color and material were good quality so the top had potential but didn't live up to it due to the fit."
2.0,"Not a good quality,"
2.0,"The size and style was what I expected.  However, the wallet has a strong, unpleasant musty / moldy smell."
2.0,"Bracelet is for children, if it is wider, the photo shows the buy as if it were large, but it is not. the return was fast and easy."
2.0,This is not worth the money cheaply made<br />It works as it should but The size is way off<br />Ordered a medium received a it says medium but it more like a extra small
2.0,"Item is silk material, I ordered a Medium (normal size) & the elastic was tight & not ruffled across my chest like shown in the pic. Looks okay on but would not order again"
2.0,For five year olds first jewelry box and I have the real kind. There is no comparison from mine and gift for a childs
2.0,"Bad, not I expected"
2.0,"These drawstring pants are cute and were almost perfect, except for one major design flaw.<br />*This review is about the light grey with black leg stripe. Not all the styles are constructed the same.*<br />There is a 2 inch wide elastic band in the waist band. The drawstring is basically a decorative addition. This band of elastic is tight and not easily forgiving. I have a very small waist, so it‚Äôs not terrible when I am standing (& maybe sucking in my gut a little), but the moment I sit and relax, it‚Äôs pretty tight on my mid-section. For reference, I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 108lbs, 26‚Äù waist. I bought the small.<br />The length is great. I love that there are pockets. And as for the rest of the pant, it is cute, fairly comfortable, and good for walking/yoga/lounging. The material is lightweight, but not see through.<br /> It‚Äôs just too bad that there is an uncomfortable, unforgiving, wide band of elastic at the waist.<br />Make sure you look closely at the photos provided here to see the waistline. Some of them look like the drawstring is sewn in properly and that they might have more give at the waist, where others (like the pair I bought) just have a plain looking waist band.<br />I honestly should have returned them and gotten another pair of the Amazon Terry Joggers, but I waited too long. Maybe I can find someone who knows how to sew to take the elastic band out and then I could use the drawstring as it‚Äôs intended."
2.0,Made of cheaper material and fits smaller than advertised
2.0,It was an oversized cheap t-shirt.  I hated it
2.0,Don't stay up very well.
2.0,Good for a themed party perhaps. The shape is gat but the frame itself was tacky and looked quite cheap
2.0,Sweater size of one size smaller.
2.0,"you need to be under 5'2&#34; for these overalls to fit like they do on the model! I'm closer to 5'8&#34; and these come to the knees on me, like something a Revolutionary War soldier might wear. I expect some things to be a little bit shorter on me, but this is laughable. they also have buttons all along the crotch and legs, like baby clothes do? I don't understand why, as even though the straps don't undo, there's plenty of room to step in and slip them up on your shoulders. these are totally goofy looking in real life. I will say they look well sewn and the denim is good quality."
2.0,I thought these were very cheaply made overall. I tried them on and immediately requested a refund. Not a quality product.
2.0,Cute and comfortable pants but they snag too easy. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2.0,"Bad purchase, trash pants"
2.0,Oldy small
2.0,I have owned several wind up pocket watches. This one has a weak main spring that broke after a couple days. T did not over wind it.
2.0,"The Shirts also didn't have the bold print I ordered , This was very disappointing"
2.0,"I took a chance on this because I‚Äôm trying to wear more prints and florals instead of just solid colors. I really was hoping I‚Äôd like it.<br /><br />However, it is not flattering on me at all. It‚Äôs a medium, and while I do wear a small, mediums can fit according to how they are made. But this medium fits like a large.<br /><br />It‚Äôs not just the large fit, it‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs constructed. The fit is nothing like on the model as in reality, on me anyway, this blouse hangs like a shapeless bag. The tie is too big and doesn‚Äôt tie up enough to do anything but hang unattractively. And in the back it just looks shapeless and boxy. There‚Äôs no nipping in at the waist as it shows on the model as the tie is big and makes everything hang wrong, and the cut of the blouse doesn‚Äôt allow for nice draping.<br /><br />The material is a polyester feel, not super cheap feeling but not quality either. At just under $28, it‚Äôs a reasonable price so I don‚Äôt expect quality material, but I did expect it to fit better.<br /><br />The sleeves are pretty. The blue color is very bright and pretty. And the flowers pop. It‚Äôs a great color for spring and summer. That it has going for it so if it fits you, then you may like it.<br /><br />I however, did not like the fit at all and would not/will not ever wear it."
2.0,When we opened package one was already broken. One day of wearing them on croc lost them. They easily fell apart. The black button came off the charms. Charms are super cute like pictures.
2.0,Cute design... NOT  THE COLORS IN THE DESCRIPTION.  I was expecting  typical Southwest Terra Cotta and Turquoise as shown in pictures... Do not be fooled! Actual necklace is lavender and faux turquoise.
2.0,Very thin material wrinkles easy and small
2.0,"Medium is usually a safe bet for me, as I am a size 6-8, however this set looks really large on me and has a masculine look. The feel reminds me of cheap bed sheets; could use quite a few washes with some fabric softener."
2.0,"These are from china. The quality is really bad, and im not sure if going up a size wouldnt fix anything.if they stretched well enough it woulsnt have botheres me Doesnt surpise me amazons quality has really gone down the drain lately"
2.0,"I got a small, the bottoms are super tight like I need a medium and the top is loose like I need an xs o.o<br />I am a pretty normal/even hourglass, this must be designed for busty girls with a smaller booty, so if that's you then order away!"
2.0,"The actual item has a picture that is MUCH, MUCH darker than is shown in the listing... so dark that it's almost impossible to even see the cat's body.  Without knowing what was pictured on it, it's a struggle to even make out what is shown.  The blue of the eyes is almost indistinguishable, it's so dark.<br /><br />This item also has a tremendous chemical stench coming off of the neoprene when first opening the package."
2.0,"I bought these dresses for maternity purposes. I bought one in an xl and the other in a xxl. I am 5‚Äô6 203 lbs and wear a 40DDD in the bust. Both dresses would have been fine for now but not later in my pregnancy  because the fabric is so thin. Even now I would have needed a slip. Both sizes were virtually the same. One didn‚Äôt fit better than the other. Also there is less fabric in the skirt than other brands so it was less forgiving and more clingy. I am 4.5 months pregnant so when my belly gets big the fabric would have pulled on my bottom revealing every nook and cranny if you catch my drift. The length was fine on me, coming right to the tops of my toes. I wish it would have worked out but not for me. I returned them."
2.0,"Stitching is off, one side is bulging up and the rest seems fine.  It's warm and would look great if that one panel wasn't a bit too big."
2.0,"Not pleased with the fit of these or the fabric quality. I knew immediately when I took them out of the box they would be too tight and uncomfortable and indeed they were. Wore them anyway hoping they would stretch with wear.... And they did, but it was the cutouts that got wider and wider and are now showing signs of almost ripping. Wore them twice and washed once. I don't think I'll get much life from these. Next time will order up and avoid cutouts around my hips and thighs."
2.0,I‚Äôll be wearing these around the house but they are a weird fit and not very cute in person
2.0,The shirt fit decent a little on the short side but the pants were way too short. Looked like high water pants
2.0,Did not come with the belt as advertised. :(
2.0,Love the design but if you have a small head stay away. This hat sits so low it wants to swallow up my ears.
2.0,"The leather is lovely, and the purse is a bit smaller than I wanted, but doable, would make a great travel bag.  However the strap is not as pictured. Instead of a clip on strap it is sewn on, which I might have overlooked, but the buckle is also not as pictured, and will not stay buckled, which I cannot overlook, as the purse keeps falling to the ground."
2.0,"I ordered based on the size chart and found the pants too big.  I have a 27&#34; waist so ordered a small but the pants hung loosely, fell down a few inches and gave a saggy waist/crotch profile.  The fabric is somewhat heavy so it hangs and pulls instead of fitting snugly.  I requested and received authorization to return but shipper would not pay for return.  Cost of return (to Canada) was a little more than $16 and since the pants only cost $20 this was not an expense I was willing to make.  Hoping I can gift them to a girlfriend."
2.0,Too wide size 7 is too big

2.0,"I've ordered numerous tank tops from &#34;Tough Cookie&#34; that all were great, but this one, as well as one other I received from them, are freakishly small.  I normally wear a medium in tank tops, but ordered this in a large due to reviews.  What a joke!  It doesn't even go down to my belly button!  When I took it out of the package I thought &#34;You've got to be kidding me, this looks like it's a little kid's shirt!&#34;  I am a size 8, and have a 36D cup.  This looks like it is made for someone without boobs though.  If you are going to buy this, buy 3 sizes up."
2.0,"Nice dress, but came in XL, and I ordered L. Both sides of dress was torn below the sleeves . I ended up sewing it myself to be able to wear it as it was last minute and nothing else to wear."
2.0,Very pretty and unusual.  I do not like the fact that it is split in the back and you have to spread or pinch it to make it fit your finger.  It would be much better if it came in sizes because by moving it back and forth sooner or later it will break.  I would not purchase it again and will probably see if my daughter wants it.
2.0,"poor quality, very tight fabric."
2.0,Way too long. Even as roll up. And snaps to hold in place are difficult to access with arthritic hands.
2.0,"Bonito dise√±o pero mala calidad , el Zipper se arruin√≥ el mismo d√≠a que mi hija lo puso por primera vez"
2.0,I got them bigger as I knew shrinkage would happen.<br />I am disappointed in the elastic. So thin around legs and around top of paintes.<br />They fall down Ugh. Usually wear an 8. They fit after washing but no elastic support.<br />Cheaply made but I get you get what you pay for.
2.0,Hat is much smaller than shown in photo. This hat will only fit a very small faced adult the way it looks in the photo.  Seams are crooked and it is not something I would buy again.
2.0,"Not worth the price,cheap feeling and looking. Retuned"
2.0,"Cute but cheap.  My husband did not like it at all, he thought it looked plastic. It was so inexpensive that I'm keeping it because Halloween is coming up and I can wear it as a tiara but I won't wear it for a night out."
2.0,You get what you pay for. Honestly the fabric reminded me of crafting felt. I wouldn‚Äôt buy this for anything beyond a Halloween costume. Returned it.
2.0,Was nothing like the picture.  Workmanship was not on point.  Ordered plus size and didn't even come close.  Was not a wide legged at all.
2.0,i‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 145 pounds 38 d cup. large was too small.
2.0,"We ordered a 4-5T for my 4T birthday girl. Waaaayy too small. Will regift to a smaller kiddo, but pretty bummed."
2.0,"It just looks &#34;ok&#34; on.  Not as sexy as in the picture-it looks kind of like a cheap grandma night gown, instead of a bathing suit cover.  It  was not for me."
2.0,"It was cute and my son loved it for the short time it lasted. The fan would not stay in place so it wouldn't stay inflated. Fortunately, my son was a good sport about it and was okay trick or treating with a deflated costume. Not worth the money spent."
2.0,Very cute but way too big for my newborn. She will grow into them but disappointed she has to wait to wear them.
2.0,"Light weight but not the best quality. Stretches out of shape easily which causes the cups to fit poorly. Cup material is a little rough and jaggy in areas.  While others may like it, I did not."
2.0,Such a disappointment!<br />This frame makes the Blaze band stick out on each side of my wrist. Maybe I put it on wrong?
2.0,It is nice but starts to unravel after about 3-4 weeks of heavy usage.  The main part of the bracelet stayed together but the gold threading and the piece that is used to tighten unravel and do not stay closed.  you end up having to make a knot to keep it from falling off.
2.0,Liked the feel and flow but was short through the body ( I even sized up to a L when I am usually a M) but still not long enough to cover the tummy when I raise my hands in yoga class ( I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 140 lbs)
2.0,Runs very big compared to other clothes in the same size.<br />Thenesie was mostly wide while the hat and pants were just generally huge.
2.0,"Color was much darker, dress was unevenly cut and fit awkwardly"
2.0,More than half of the lights do not work.  Try everyone out before you keep them.  Very disappointed.  Nice product if they worked.
2.0,"The material is thicker than what I think, it is more like scarf material, not really suitable to be wearing in summer on top of a swimming suit. I don‚Äôt think I will be wearing this piece. In addition, the white tie rope in the middle looks a bit cheaply-made to me."
2.0,The ring is absolutely beautiful but has turned my finger green and has now started to tarnish and I've only had it for 2 weeks.
2.0,Will keep them because it's too much trouble to send back.
2.0,Does not increase the breathing space enough to make a difference. I will look for something that creates a larger air space under the Mask to actually make breathing easier.
2.0,"Its a pretty skirt, good fabric, but it was too long for my frame, I am 5ft and even with heels was very long way past the length shown on picture"
2.0,"i got the size that fit my hand based on the chart, I measured with a tape measure. if the glove is too tight you can use it but your hands will go numb. I need to return these. but the design is good. the inside of it is very sticky. the ball cant get wet, however, then zero grip."
2.0,"Sharp spots on some areas, not well finished."
2.0,"Although the on-line picture of the dress does appear to have muted colors, I did not anticipate that it had a grey hue which makes the dress look dirty.  After reading the reviews, I ordered a Small although I usually am a Medium.  The small fit fine and the medium probably would have been too big.  The description does say &#34;Maxi&#34; but the picture shows the dress to be floor length so this is rather deceiving.  Perhaps the model is short.  I am 5'7&#34; and the dress is definitely a Maxi ... NOT floor length as depicted in the picture.  Last but not least, the material has a terrible odor.  I will be returning this one."
2.0,"The battery location.<br />The battery is in the palm side of the gauntlet and it's length is parallel to your arm. This wouldnt be an issue if the gauntlet was at least an inch or two longer.<br />Unfortunately there is very little room to get the battery in, and the entire inside of the gauntlet is swollen by the battery which makes putting on the gloves very difficult.<br />That is even further exacerbated by the glove cut itself.<br />The wrist is far too narrow, when added to the extreme bulk of the battery just putting the gloves on is very difficult.<br />If you are working outside and have to remove them a couple times to do something requiring dexterity, you will spend five minutes just trying to put them on every time.<br />Even then the battery fell out a couple times while wearing and was hanging by the wires.<br />I do like the aesthetics, which is what the two stars are for, but they are not worth the price.<br />I am returning.<br />Which is a bummer because I also ordered a spare set of batteries."
2.0,"Buy small, but it was too big. I guess is not an option if you are petite, not too warm, but the colors were just like in the picture,the product is the same as picture."
2.0,"Way too small. Not an XL or plus size, could not even get it on my body to see if it fit. lol."
2.0,"If this is thick, I would hate to see what regular is. It's no thicker than any other standard NATO strap.  Maybe even a bit thinner.  From my understanding,  a ZULU strap is supposed to be thicker material than a NATO strap. The metal hardware seems sturdy and it does have stitching instead of being glued. I say this because I bought a Barton NATO strap that was actually glued together with no stitching.  This product is made in China if you're wondering.  Definitely not a high quality ZULU strap."
2.0,Didn't fit and were too big when I was at a size 2g. Stretched to a 0g to see if they would fit and now they are too small...
2.0,"Had to return it and get larger size, shorts are very small and the design is snug, shrinks when washed as well"
2.0,"I really wanted to like these pants, but they just didn't fit me right. I have fairly long legs (I'm 5'6&#34; but proportionally my legs are long, closer to someone who is 5'9&#34;), but even then, the bows were down to my ankles, making these look like awkward, chubby full-length pants rather than cute crop pants. They were also weirdly bulky in places at the top (but they fit tightly at my hips, so I couldn't go down a size). Just kind of a bad fit overall, which is disappointing, because my legs look more or less like the model's (I'm usually a size 2 or 4), and they look fine on her. I returned these."
2.0,"These pajamas are the oddest thing. They are the exact design and color of the picture. When I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised and happy. However, when I tried them on it was a different story. The fit is very strange. Not to big or small, almost as if they were sewn incorrectly. I considered maybe I put the shorts on backwards not paying attention but nope. I hate to say it but save your money on these."
2.0,"writing on charm too small, hard to read."
2.0,Fit was nice but colors were waaaay different than what I was expecting. I thought this was black with orange and yellow flowers but what I got was blue.
2.0,This ring is huge. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. If you don't like rings that take up your whole finger don't buy this
2.0,El estilo es muy diferente ala de la foto
2.0,I went by the size chart and they are much smaller than we expected.
2.0,"Skirt patterns are done with glitter, which will get all over the house. I returned it as soon as I saw the glitter. There are many versions out there that don't have this issue."
2.0,they were very small. I bought a size for my husband and when it came it would fit a med. child.  It was supposed to be for men. The size was way off.
2.0,The shirts were way smaller than expected.
2.0,Way too small. Material is also very cheap and itchy. would not recommend.
2.0,The material is thick and heavy; the fit is loose.  The quality is the lowest of four jammers I have ordered from Amazon.
2.0,"I bought 3 pairs of these jeggings - the colors are great, but as others have warned, they don't stretch. The sizes are not consistent either. One pair I could wear if I didn't plan on sitting down, but they were too short in the crotch, no matter how much I pulled them up. I'm 5'4&#34;, 115 - not heavy, not a stick. I really wanted them to work, but sadly, I returned them."
2.0,Too tight and low cut. Cute shirt otherwise
2.0,Very shiny looking and color true to picture. Hope they fit when we get our second order as first order sent was different size from what we ordered.
2.0,"Product runs small. I'm normally a large and to feel remotely comfortable in this dress I'd have to order a 2x. The fabric isn't stretch and very see through, even the underslip. Returning for another dress."
2.0,POS chain. Very thin. Had to get another chain.
2.0,They look nice and have the correct size but they lost their shape and they are very slippery. Better with rubber sole.
2.0,Very cheap quality and much smaller fitting than expected.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress! It definitely did not fit as expected, it‚Äôs very baggy and long. I think with a woman who is taller, this could be what they are looking for. It just wasn‚Äôt flattering on my body and felt like a huge drape. It‚Äôs very warm though, would be a nice winter dress for a tall gal!"
2.0,Have purchased 6 different pairs of the shorts through Costco. Every pair I have purchased has either popped a pocket zipper or stitching directly below the bottom of the main zipper in front. After 2 months of owning the shorts I now only have one pair remaining.<br /><br />If they work for you they are comfortable shorts but I cannot recommend them.
2.0,scratches no Good
2.0,Although I'm not the first to mention this they sent me the wrong one.i ordered a grey cat purse.they sent me a brown cat purse.i dont care for the brown one.plus the zipper pull was broke off so disappointed other than the zipper they seem made well at least.
2.0,It fits weird. The material is nice.
2.0,"(Original review:) Nice and comfy and gives me a much-needed one-inch height boost, but sometimes it feels like I'm about to step right out of them. When I tried to adjust the buckle it left an ugly creast in the leather and didn't help at all.<br /><br />(Addendum, 11 months later:) Coming apart already. Only started happening this last summer, so I guess it's due to sweat. I shouldn't have to wear socks with sandals."
2.0,These look just like the ones that came with my engraver in the printer but when I got them they are so dark it's more like welding glasses.  I can barely see anything with them on.
2.0,The dragon on these earrings are not as clear in person . In person they were not as impressive.
2.0,"Color is pretty, tight around the top with no give."
2.0,"Cheaply made, not what I was expecting! The fit was smaller than size I ordered."
2.0,I am usually a 34B but I order a 36B to be safe. It is way too small!! I actually ripped it when I clasped the back. I would return this if I could.
2.0,"I feel this shirt is a little small and tight even indicated size M.  I'm not a large size men & I'm wearing all my shirts size M.  The package was delivered few days ago & I'm not sure what to do next: return for exchange or keep it.  Unfortunately, sizing issues turned to be questionable or misleading more and more  often.  With my previous order, supplier noticed me they mailed to me size L instead of ordered size M.<br />I rated product only two star because of this"
2.0,Very large.. It is the size that fits for adults.. Lol..
2.0,"I bought these for my wife and so sad to say that these shoes are way too narrow!!! She is a size 8 1/2-9 and I maybe should have ordered a size 10 for comfort. I don't know if that would have helped because she says they are painful!! Steve madden shoes seem like they tend to run small. I would recommend going a size up, but in this case if they are too narrow I don't know how much that would have helped! Were going to try and stretch them out to see if that will help. She says they are beautiful suede but that she won't be able to walk in them :("
2.0,To large and was disappointed in the quality of a Desigual product.  Returned it.
2.0,So uncomfortable! Kept moving! Dug into my skin and left marks. Worst strapless ever
2.0,The dress was too wide in the shoulder area
2.0,"I was so disappointed to receive this with the chain broken! it is a nice, pretty item if I didn't have to get it repaired first!"
2.0,"I was really looking forward to this dress, and super disappointed with what showed up. If you follow the size chart, the dress will fit as expected which is why I gave this a 2 star rating. The red on my dress was more of a coral orange, but the worst part was this dress isn't just shiny, its really similar to bathing suit material, not breathable at all. Will be returning this tomorrow."
2.0,"Normally wear a medium and went one size larger so it would be longer. The fit is OK but it still wasn‚Äôt long enough. If you‚Äôre doing a lot of overhead reach as part of your workout and have a long torso, it still probably won‚Äôt cover you."
2.0,Chain tangles with keys. I purchased this one specifically because of the chain. Was disappointed when the chain became a problem.
2.0,This item will be returned shortly.  The dress is not cut to size.  It is extremely short waisted.  Print is nice tho.
2.0,"I loved the dress, fit perfect. The o Lt problem was that I wore it once and the zipper split and now I have to have the zipper replaced. Disappointed to say the least"
2.0,"Product was described as 2 pairs of reading glasses packed in storage tubes.  When I opened the tube and removed the first pair, one of the nose pads was missing.  It was loose and at the bottom of the tube.  There is no way to re-attach it.  Thankfully, the second pair was intact.  So, I paid for two pairs and got one.  Not worth the effort to return them as defective.  I'll be buying a different brand in the future as I doubt I'll hear anything regarding my dissatisfaction"
2.0,The blue scarf had pink in it! I was hoping for just shades of blue and hints on white but they were pink instead. :(
2.0,Too shiny and thick material.
2.0,"The shirt in the photo appears to be a pale pink color, but the shirt that arrived with my order is lavender. The fabric is very thin, which is cool for summer, but also did nothing to camouflage whatever bumps are under it. I was disappointed and decided to return this top."
2.0,These pants did not fit properly. They were definitely long enough with a roomy waist but the thigh area was snug. Plus the material was stiff and not soft. It had no movement to it. They were returned.
2.0,"Bought this watch for ruggedness and style to wear in and out of uniform. Exchanged first two because I thought maybe manufactures defect was causing watch to stop intermittently. On third one now and problem persists. Additionally, no way to see time in dark without shining light on watch. Ironically, talked to a coworker who has same model and his too does the exact same thing. Looks great and I'd actually been wanting this particular one for some time, but now wish I'd never bought it. Would not recommend purchasing, and really wish Casio would've addressed the problems with this model. DON'T BUY!"
2.0,I did not like the material so I have returned it.
2.0,"The description says 'bootcut' but based on the picture, the pants look more like ankle pants with a slight flair.  In actuality, they are extremely long (I'm 5'6"" and ordered a Medium) with a huge flair / bell.  Waist also seemed large for a Medium.  I only recently changed sizes to a Medium from a Large, and these fit more like a Large.  Material was as expected."
2.0,"Order a large.  The size large description states size 34 - 37.  I know for a fact that I have a 34&#34; waist.  The belt was way too long, couldn't fasten it in any of the holes."
2.0,Broke the first time she put it on.
2.0,I for the black set a while ago and was so happy with how long the pants are. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and it‚Äôs so hard to find any pants I can wear with heels besides skinny jeans. The black pants were so long I loved them. I‚Äôve seen a lot of reviews with how annoyed shorter girls were with the length so I think they started making them shorter or something. I‚Äôll probably give this set to my short friend since the pants don‚Äôt hit the floor üòî
2.0,Not bad. Looks nothing like the picture
2.0,EVERYTHING sticks to this material. They are a little see through with light colored underwear.
2.0,"This dress was not appealing AT ALL. I returned the dress because it ran big, the stitching was coming undone, and it was almost see through."
2.0,Fits but its is definitely not the material shown in the picture. It does not flare out like a vintage dress it just comes straight down and very cheaply made. You will have to put something under it to make it flare out like the picture.
2.0,"This belly ring looks nice but since it is one solid piece, it doesn't sit properly."
2.0,Very pretty and i love it.ihad no regret in buying it.thanks alot
2.0,"Beautiful picture, but the ring that holds the pull and the lock together fell apart after less than a week of use."
2.0,Was not a fan of the material and overall quality. Felt cheap. Good design but be aware that this is sized smaller due to manufacturing in China.
2.0,Not as it appears
2.0,"Unfortunately, it's very cheap looking. There are no zippers or anything to fit in, but the lace part of the material isn't stretchy enough to really form around you, so it ends up sort of loose in weird places. Great idea, not great execution."
2.0,I was very excited when the slippers arrived. A week later I‚Äôm disappointed. The nose on Luigi is already coming off and the suspenders on Mario :(
2.0,"These fit great, except they are really short... think crop top."
2.0,The knit is warm and soft but runs really big. 34DDD and I ordered a medium that has lots of room to spare.
2.0,"I just received these and they're leaving my confused. They say 8-12 men's size in the description as well as on the soles. But when I compare them to my older insoles, they match them exactly in size even though I wear a size 9 and these are supposedly size 12. So I didn't have to cut them at all and that match size 9 randomly. It's odd."
2.0,Sleeve has a tear at the seam when it was delivered
2.0,"I got these when I was around 4 months pregnant. Switched to them at 5 months when my regular navel ring wasn't fitting anymore. The length of these are great, but no matter how many times I pushed it up, the top ball was always shoved all the way down so much so that it created a &#34;permanent&#34; dent in my skin. I never wear tight clothing either so I'm not sure how that happened. After a month I couldn't take it anymore and took it out for good. It took almost 2 months for the dent in my skin where the ball was to go away.<br /><br />Luckily it was pierced for so long that it stayed open, but overall I was not happy with these."
2.0,Disappointed in the size of the slipper. I wear size 14 on all of my shoes. This 14 is extremely large and actually dangerous. They fall off my feet when I am going down stairs.
2.0,"I normally get a 3xl because I like my shirts and tunics to be flowy, as they are designed to be.  This is not the case with these tunic tops. The arms are skin tight, the bust is skin tight and see-through and I cannot wear them to work, which is what I bought them for.<br />I will agree with the other reviewers that the material is super soft, but it‚Äôs a moot point, since there is no way I can wear these. I ordered 6 of these for my new job and unfortunately, they will all have to go back."
2.0,Much bigger than I thought. Will probably return them.
2.0,"Had bought these to were during my wedding ceremony on the lawn, but they were simply way too large. I had to return them :("
2.0,Color is not a true navy or as pictured. It is closer to a royal blue than a navy blue.
2.0,Not a fan.Actually is not made that good. The material is soft .The dress itself is a disappointment.
2.0,"Eh for the price..I mean I can‚Äôt really complain but I am anyways lol. They ran kinda big, see-through (the yellow and blue)-but honestly I ended up cutting them into shorts and they look totally better"
2.0,"Item is way too big. I ordered xs.  I'm 5'1"" and 97 pounds."
2.0,beware this product is super thin and small. not really what i thought it was
2.0,The slippers were 2 inches longer than the stated size. Amazon was great about refunding immediately. We will order a different style from amazon.
2.0,i would size down. im a 135 size small 5'5 and it just is a little long and wide on me
2.0,Purchased for my cousin's renaissance wedding. Skirt and corset were beautiful but I only got to wear it for a half hour before I had to change out of it. The lace started unraveling and the boning started poking out of the fabric and jabbing into my side. The clasps were also flimsy and started bending. I was so disappointed especially for the price. It looked bomb before it started falling apart. I ended up returning the product.
2.0,"I‚Äôve bought three pairs, i‚Äôve loved them all. However in the 6 months i‚Äôve owned them, maybe the 5-6 times i‚Äôve warn them there‚Äôs already a hole and not even in the seam. I haven‚Äôt worn them a ton because it‚Äôs been the summer months. They‚Äôve never been in the dryer and i‚Äôm just disappointed there is a hole in them already for the price that they are."
2.0,"Pretty, but not what I expected."
2.0,The item sheds and gets fibers on almost everything it touches.
2.0,"Purchased these collar extenders as I have been gaining weight and my 30+ dress shirts with size 15-1/2 collars were getting too tight to button up. Based on my personal experience with them, I would not recommend them for the following reasons:<br /><br />They are very difficult to button into the shirt. After sliding the loop side over the button, getting the disc into the button hole was extremely difficult and annoying. It reminded me of the first time I tried to put contacts in my eyes 30 years ago.<br /><br />The stretchy extender sinks into your neck all day and makes wearing the extender for a full day very uncomfortable.<br /><br />Finally, it is really hard to make the collars look good with the extenders on. Even with a large tie knot over the extender, it looks like you have left the top button unbuttoned (which, technically, you have).<br /><br />Unless there is another product available that is a viable alternative, these extenders probably won‚Äôt do the trick for you."
2.0,They break
2.0,I bought size L but it is too big. And material isn‚Äôt good.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt heat the body like I thought plus bought it too small.
2.0,The graphic print of the shirt is the correct size but the graphic itself is of such low quality I was pretty disappointed. Definitely not what's advertised in the picture.
2.0,"No No No, this looks different from the pic online, my husband was like ‚Äúwhat is that, it looked different online.‚Äù The color was off AND you can see through the dress, very inappropriate, I returned this very quick"
2.0,Soles are very slippery. Be careful walking on wood/vinyl/tile/linoleum floors. Basically anything but the sidewalk or a street. Lol
2.0,Ok this is a nice looking band when I opened it up. But it took me like 5 minutes to put it on my watch face. The little black links that slid into the watch kept getting caught and only on one side the other went in fine. Once I did get it on it felt very ridiged and stiff. I have a semi small wrist and it just wasn't comfortable. It looks nice but not for me.<br /><br />I was hoping it was a keeper but alas it is not.<br />Maybe it might work for you.
2.0,"Very long dress, which would ok if you are fall. Whilst the pockets are are a great adddirion they are not sewn in and are bulgy which just adds a lump of fabric in your dress. The overall style is somewhat ok but I am not a fan and also need to mention the heavy fabric . Returning this one!"
2.0,Very cheaply made. Stockings are extremely thin. Ended up not wearing them.
2.0,NOT AS SEEN LIKE THE PICTURES
2.0,"So even though this show is lovely and fits the length of my foot, if your foot is on the fatter side the middle across band will be tight as it was for me. I bought size 8 which would have been perfect if it wasn‚Äôt for the tight band"
2.0,"not a quality product, but i guess you get what you pay for.  the lights are in a weird place and the song is screwed up"
2.0,not satisfied at all
2.0,"I like the polarized lenses, but they are ALWAYS smudged...no matter how I've tried cleaning/buffing them. The color is cool, too. Easy to install."
2.0,Too large for wallet
2.0,It‚Äôs still a cute shirt but it doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. It has the ‚Äòradiate positivity‚Äô on it but it‚Äôs not washed out it‚Äôs a brightish teal color. It also hangs different and is more formed fitting.
2.0,Such a cute bag BUT when I took it out of the packaging the bag smelled terrible - like dead fish. It still smells horrible and I've tried everything to get the scent out.
2.0,"Only kept it because once washed it didn't reek anymore. Doesn't fit at all like the pictures, but is thick and works for winter."
2.0,"The dress is adorable but extremely small, the sizing chart is incorrect. The workmanship is great. I am a size 14 and the large dress doesnt fit over my head. Also, the side zipper does not help if you have a chest. There is no give to the material. Recommend a 2-3XL if you are a 14."
2.0,really cute but magnetic piece broke after a couple days could not wear it properly
2.0,Read the product carefully - the hats are tiny and you have to shape them into cones yourself. We returned - it just would work for us.
2.0,"I am pretty disappointed in this item.. The photo shows it as a light sweatshirt like material with a lower neckline.  What I received was a more casual office attire knit shirt.  The sleeves are a little longer than 3/4, they sit a couple inches above my wrists when my arms are extended.  I purchased a XXL as I wanted a really baggy comfortable knock-around shirt, and it is just barely baggy.  I am 5'8&#34; and am about 175lbs (typically a size 14-16 or Large-XL).  I will be returning unfortunately"
2.0,"I ordered a larger size, but not sure if that helped or hurt. It was big in some areas, and fit better in others. Regardless, it was not flattering and I don‚Äôt think a different size would have changed that. It just hangs, but not freely, so it looks bulky. The material isn‚Äôt flowy enough. I thought it would be more like a chiffon, but it‚Äôs not. The color was also not bright white, but more creamy. And lastly, the other reason I am returning, is because there was also a small stain."
2.0,"Good looking watch but I had a reaction to the plastic after wearing it for two days. Honestly, never have skin issues or reactions but after two days of wearing this watch got a red, itchy reaction under the band. Has anyone else experienced this? I had to stop wearing it because it only got worse."
2.0,"Not a great fit!! Super high waisted, they reached right under my bra line. They smelled so bad they went right into the wash!! The stitching was super itchy and the size pocket is a bit small for my phone. I will be giving them away. Will be buying a better pair."
2.0,I just wanted some small turquoise studs. Maybe I was being unrealistic that their diameter was so tiny.
2.0,The color and design was not like the photo.
2.0,Thankfully I am only wearing this shirt for Halloween and will have a jacket covering most of it. Buyer beware: The shirt runs VERY small.
2.0,"If you have thicker calves, these won't work. I couldn't get them past my calves."
2.0,As commented before the lens appear to be orange when looking through then. I bought these to go riding with my motorcycle. With everything an orange tint this will not do. There is no mentioning of orange tint in the description of this product. They are blue but thats just one side.(the side everyone else can see) They fit perfectly into my oakleys though.
2.0,"This was ok, but I ordered one from else where a few months ago that was much better quality.  This does not have the items needed to attach and picture or the globe to cover the picture on the charm,  the other I got had double sided tape to hold the picture in place and the globe had sticky tape to help it stick to the charm. Spend the few more dollars and get everything you need to put this together correctly."
2.0,I didn't love them. It does hold my breast in place but it does nothing for them. I wouldn't repurchase
2.0,Stopped working after two days.  Case is thick compared to most watches.
2.0,very disappointed!  dress came in ugly mustard color and  with  ruffles around the knees. not as shown  on picuture at all!  ion pictures all dresses look very pretty.
2.0,"I loved this when I got it, but it ripped very soon after receiving it. I‚Äôm not a big chested girl, so I was very disappointed."
2.0,Smal. Not the XL expected.
2.0,The shirt was nice. Quality was good but for some readon they sent me two sizes larger than wgat I ordered so it was too big. Gave to a family member and she likes it :)
2.0,"The sweater was really cute, but had a bad smell to it and was way to small."
2.0,"Material has marks on it that don't wash out, made well just cloth marked with white marks.pockets arrived sewn shut. Not as described"
2.0,Both mine & my boyfriends broke in about 2 weeks of having them
2.0,I am used to the product &#34;fashion forms&#34; sold at Target but they are always out of my size.  This product has ho support at all.  The holes in the adhesive cause it to not work as well.  I will not purchase again and instead went to target.com and got the fashion forms version.<br />One advantage... the case they come in is nice.<br />Overall I am out $25.
2.0,I ordered 5 different pair here on Amazon but this brand the top runs small and it's shorter than it looks.  Also pants are silky and top is cloth
2.0,"I wasn't able to wear it, ad it was a little too tight. The fabric was heavier than I expected, also. I have to return it."
2.0,I was disappointed with the packaging and the physical appearance of the item. It arrived wrinkled and in a small plastic bag.
2.0,"Nice pants.....but size was wayyyyyyyyyyy off.....They run large, and are very stretchy... I need one size smaller.  I would give the pants, and their customer service, 5 stars  if they would send me one size smaller, at NO CHARGE....I would even pay for the return postage of the larger size !!!!"
2.0,"Cheap, Wavy brim."
2.0,It‚Äôs to small for a x-L
2.0,"The fabric was bulky and heavy (would be a good winter dress). Looks great on the model, but didn't really work for me. Also, seemed to fit a bit large compared to other dresses I have purchased.<br /><br />I returned the dress no problem, which is great, but really not what I was expecting."
2.0,"The item itself is stunning. Very beautiful. The unfortunate part is that the clasp to hold the cage part together did not work, so I never even got a chance to try it out. I was so excited about this too. I searched for a long time to find the perfect one, and this is the one that spoke to me. But of course, with my luck, it was not meant to be."
2.0,"Was way too small to be a 2X, it could fit a small or teenager"
2.0,"Disappointed.  I was hopeful that they would not slip, but they did...just like all the others I have purchased over the years.  I always wind up taking them off and going without."
2.0,"Cute, but it not very well made.  The strap that falls behind lost a stitch and is beginning to fray.  I like the gold details on the ends, super cute."
2.0,Loved my ear vines but they broke after wearing just twice !
2.0,"I should have read more deeply into the reviews -- plenty of people here warned me that this is terrible quality, but I believed the first few reviews and that lovely picture of a full, fluffy scarf on that customer. Honestly I wonder whether they were given a different product, maybe the manufacturer changed production factories or cut down on material expenses. What I received is worse quality than  the fur collar attached to a $20 sweater that I wore in middle school (a la Spice Girls, Bratz, That's So Raven). I mean, I've never owned faux fur that felt so polyester. This collar was reminiscent of the plastic grass you get in Easter baskets. It didn't actually feel like that, but it was reminiscent -- in my opinion, no faux fur should be compared to Easter grass.<br /><br />I wish I had taken a picture, but I was so eager to return it.<br />For me, 2 stars = I really didn't like it and 1 star = legitimately had problems. In case you were wondering why I gave it 2 stars if I disliked it so much."
2.0,It was cute in the picture. Not so cute when it arrived. There was s problem getting it delivered.  All very upsetting!
2.0,"It's okay.  Kind of flimsy, but serves the purpose.  Thought I would like the fold up design, but it is bothersome."
2.0,It fit ok
2.0,"Took this on a trip to Amsterdam. NO SUN. NO POWER! Had one day of sun and it did not charge for the next day.<br />The straps do not stay securely on your arms, should have put a snap strap across the chest!<br />Has no outside mesh holders for water or anything else so you have to open the thing every time you need to get in it.<br />It was exhausting."
2.0,The shirt is pretty but it was way too big. I ordered a large because that‚Äôs normally a perfect fit for me. It was more like a XXL. Unfortunately I already threw away the packaging so I‚Äôm stuck with it.
2.0,Returned. Looked silver plated. Not what I wanted.
2.0,This was so much smaller than the picture and what I expected.
2.0,I liked the shape but stones were dull and not impressive
2.0,Very tight fit.  short sleeve lenth.  thin material.  its more for a tiny girl or junior.  not an athletic woman.  Won‚Äôt last a couple months.
2.0,Beautiful color and make just a bit tight
2.0,"I ordered these for my brother's wedding. My mom and I are both wearing different size heels, and when we measured them for sizes according to the websites instructions, we were happy to find that my heels were the Super Skinny size and hers were the Xtra Small... and they both came in 1 pack. They arrived today, and I just tried them on the shoes. Based on the measurements, they should have fit. Unfortunately, the Super Skinny was way too small for my heel... it didn't even go in. However, the XS fit just fine. Needless to say, XS didn't even come close to fitting on the heel of her shoe, even though we measured according to the instructions. I just ordered another pack, a size up... and that's fine, they'll get here in time for the wedding... but it's frustrating because we measured correctly and the product came up short."
2.0,"Will not buy again , Way ste of money"
2.0,"The dress is a bit thin, almost see-through. Not great quality."
2.0,"Thin, rough material.  Very tight fit."
2.0,"These are fine except they are significantly smaller than the IRIS charms I have, so I can't use them as I'd hoped (spacers between glass beads and also to hold charms).  When they say they are compatible with Pandora style charms, it's not really true - they are way too small."
2.0,I didn't like the tassels.
2.0,Pretty but broke
2.0,Fit was not good on me.  The waist came up really high and had a bad shape.  The material was stiff and not good.  Maybe after a wash or two it would be better but the fit was so bad they went back.
2.0,"Does not fit as expected. I normally wear a medium in rompers- this one was extremely large! I'm a size 4, 5'5 130 lbs."
2.0,Screw fell out after wearing only a couple of times.
2.0,It's cute but it doesn't fit quite right didn't pull around to the front it's more of a shrug than a sweater
2.0,These are not tube socks. They are thin material with a small band at the top.
2.0,The neck is very tight and I don't have an overly large neck.  Also the dress part on the inside barely goes over the butt and is very snug making what would have been a comfy easy dress into something tight and uncomfortable.  Really too bad because the color is lovely and the style is so easy for a sea side vacation.  Returning it.
2.0,The quality is not worth it buy another brand
2.0,"Not the color displayed, a hot pink instead"
2.0,"The idea was good, but the pattern layout made the straps not fall in places that would make this look sexy.  Also, as others may have said, you have to have NICE looking and firm boobs in order for this to even look anything near sexy.  If you are small or especially have sagging breasts, then this product will accentuate the defects and it does not look pretty, believe me!"
2.0,"This vest is the perfect thickness (thin) for layering and adding core warmth, which is what I was looking for. However, size and fit are way off. I'm 5'2 136 36b and the small is huge and way to long. The length I get. Im good with a product that fits taller women<br />but the sizing? Come on. And the if your going to make super-sized clothes, then also have xxs and xs."
2.0,It‚Äôs tiny has sharp corners
2.0,"I expected the arny logo to be embroided,, very disapointed"
2.0,This is way too sheer to be a mask. It could only be worn as a mask cover.
2.0,It‚Äôs see through. Would make for a perfect tie dye project dress.
2.0,I love the color and pattern but the fabric is so tight it hugs my body too much. I'm full figured and I don't want it to show everything.
2.0,"This thing is way too large for a front pocket wallet. I guess the chinese have big pockets. Nice wallet, excellent quality!"
2.0,I ordered a 36&#34; waist it says extra large on the label but they fit my son who has a 28&#34; waist. he likes them.
2.0,Keep your money......my hubby ordered these for me for Christmas and once they FINALLY arrived from China I was sorely disappointed.  1. even after soaking these in alcohol to disinfect them the Right ear ring always hurts my ear.  The Left one will not stay clasped.  Although I like the look of these ear rings they are not functional.  I'm very disappointed in several of the purchases we've made with Amazon.com/<br />AmazonPrime.....they seem to care more about the quantity than the quality.  Very sad......
2.0,I didn‚Äôt care for the material. It is odd. It feels almost like a lightweight felt on the exterior. I can see it pilling in the future.
2.0,"I ordered both XL and XXL because the description says sizes run small. First, the fabric was different on each dress: one was stretchy cotton, the other was a silky fabric (think bathrobe because that's what it looked like on me). I am only 5'4 and the XL (stretchy cotton) is very short (you can see my feet), which means I can't wear heels with it because they make it look even shorter. All around, I am not a fan. I'm returning the XXL for sure, and may end up returning the XL, as well."
2.0,It's beautiful but very small
2.0,Was really looking forward to these.  Bought them in my size only to find them to be super tight with the elastic cutting into my legs.  Why can't people make plus size items that really do fit plus size people?  I'll be giving them away.
2.0,"I wish I could give these earring a higher rating because my daughter loved them and they have cute designs however, about 75% were defective. The glue was either really old or not enough but the actual design easily comes off from the clip. I‚Äôm hoping to fix them myself but wish I didn‚Äôt have to."
2.0,Way too small. I think the size chart may be off.
2.0,"This is my first ukulele clip on strap I ever used, as I just purchased a Kala UBass and wanted to try it instead of a shoulder strap.  It appears well constructed, adjusts easily, and works just fine. My only gripe is that the material that loops on your neck is very uncomfortable to me. It feels like seat belt material in a automobile only thinner, and felt like it was chafing my neck after 15 minutes from the sharp edges. For 10-12 bucks I'm not bothering to return it, as I can just put a small towel between the seat belt and the skin on my neck, or wear a collared shirt. Functionality: A Comfort: F (on bare skin)"
2.0,Color wasn't as expected and I didn't like the material
2.0,I only had the silver one on for few hours and my wrist was green. The black one is fine. I don‚Äôt know if it will help yet but I‚Äôll continue to watch for any progress.
2.0,The sizes are not us sizes. The med.is like a size 2 in the u.s. Good product if size was right.I am a size 8 a med. should have fit.
2.0,"I had written a positive review on these items, but I just had to edit it now because I am truly upset.  This is supposed to be Sterling Silver bangles, but I just wore them today for the 3rd time and I noticed they are turning yellow on me.  Already!  I am upset b/c I thought the product would maintain it's shininess. Now I'm stuck with them b/c it's not worth it for me to return them.  It would cost me more to return them than what the items are worth. I had bought a total of 3 all together.  I would not recommend these items to anybody."
2.0,"I am on the fence about these. They fit a little large. Feels a little slippery when walking will have to put some skid resistance pads at the bottom of shoe. Overall, they are ok for the price of $7.00.  Probably wouldn't buy again though."
2.0,2 stars it's cute I loved the idea but cheap materials. Wore it once and it broke already on the latch.
2.0,see through...too short...too small
2.0,"The smell, the texture, everything is awful. I wore this for a murder mystery dinner party I was throwing and honestly, I almost had to change the whole plot because I couldn't bare to wear it more than 10 seconds. I got through it though. Maybe I'm just too sensitive. I have been known to be high strung, but if you've been called that too then you'll prob feel the same as me so don't buy it."
2.0,"Love the design, but it looks like it could unravel at any moment. Returning tomorrow"
2.0,These dresses are very poor quality material. Cover yourself underneath as they are see through in the sunlight! I was very disappointed. I will not order this product again.
2.0,"This was adorable, but fell apart within 24 hours on my 5 year old. She was very disappointed. It cost me under $3, so you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Measurements all wrong. Shorts very long , hat bill very long."
2.0,Nice style but I wish leopard  pattern looked more natural  colors are off.
2.0,"I ordered this in black.  There aren't nearly as many flowers as the picture shows. im 5'7&#34; 145lbs &ordered a large but not sure if thats what i got since there are no tags at all..no size, material, washing instructions, no brand name!  It fit, but i did not like it! I did not like the fabric or the neckline or the lack of flowers!  I sent it back :("
2.0,Shipped fast but the shirt is very low quality.  Cheap shirts with cheap dies.  You won't want to wear it.
2.0,Ordered a 3x and it was like mens s-m.  gave it to a kid for use at ren fest
2.0,"Not adjustable, I'd need tools to pry it open. Don't recommend unless you got small skinny hands of 12 year old."
2.0,Product was so large it could not really be used as knee warmers
2.0,"The glasses are adorable; however, when I opened them to put them on, the arm of the glasses was completely broken. While I know you get what you pay for, I was disappointed that the glasses were received broken. Just be mindful!"
2.0,They wouldn't fit. The lenes were l larger than my original lenes.
2.0,"This dress has a very strange cut.  It might look flattering on some people (I bought based on some of the pictures in the reviews), but it totally looked bizarre on me.  (The sleeves stuck straight out at the shoulders, for one thing.)  The material is also VERY thick and didn't seem comfortable to wear.  All in all, it was awkward and only took me 3 seconds to try it on and realize it wasn't going to happen.  I returned this.<br /><br />**I returned it, BUT did not get my full refund back for some reason.  Only got about 80% of my purchase price - what the heck???"
2.0,Red and white hem on sleeves and bottom fell apart on first wear
2.0,Kept it for my girlfriend.  I could not even put it on even though I choose the size according to the size chart. Like to design but you may want to buy 2 size above recommendation!
2.0,"I wanted to like these! :(  I normally wear a medium, but these (in medium) arrived & fit like an extra small.  Like, obnoxiously small.  The fabric was nice & the potential was there, I just feel that the sizing was way far off; had to return."
2.0,"The heels I will be wearing are pretty this but they are not like pin. This have 2 protectors of 2 different sizes and both are for pin thin shoes. I could not get them in my heels for the life of me. I had to cut them on the side to be able to push them in. It sucks because protectors do not run cheap. I tried to walk in them after putting them in seems off balance, sadly."
2.0,"I just wash them couple time and wear them couple time but it‚Äôs look so old fabric,and got prinkle so much..plus the trap side been ripped off ..not good"
2.0,Used the sizing chart they provided and the sizing still not accurate. The measurements are off and even though I am returning I can't get my size because they don't have XL in the red stripe. It's a shame because it is cute and there aren't any others like it I can find on Amazon in that color combo. Will be returning.
2.0,"I bought this to wear for easter however when it arrived it was so small I could not wear it and ended up giving it to a family member as a gift.  I am 5'5"" and normally wear an XL.  This was small everywhere.  I sized up to a XXXL and it still didnt come even close to fitting."
2.0,The clips were extremely tight and couldn't be adjusted. I simply couldn't wear them.  They're on their way back to the seller.
2.0,Very skimpy and flimsy
2.0,"Unconfortable, too much reflection on glasses that cuses bad vision, cheap material..."
2.0,My 11 year old played with it for 2 days and the belt broke off.  Looks like the belt is just glued on with hot glue.
2.0,"I am 5'8 145 lbs and DDD. This fits mostly, expect my chest is basically showing everything, so I have to wear a higher sitting bralette to compensate. So that is disappointing. I have a black bra that works well but I dont have a tan one, so I cant match the fabric. So that one I basically cant wear...I got the largest size they had. Unless you are very petite AND have smaller boobs, then I DO NOT recommend this."
2.0,Good seller but the item I never wore but i am trying to sell it.
2.0,color not as shown... very robin's egg blue tho looked slate in pic.<br /><br />Extremely heavy... returned
2.0,Not as dark as I would like them....nothing like the original...good transaction.
2.0,"Advertised as &#34;extra large&#34;, but size is really no more than large."
2.0,Didn't get the variety shown.
2.0,The watch didn't last two days before the stem broke
2.0,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift, but after one wear and hand-washing, the logo is already peeling off. Definitely not worth the money for a plain, gray hat."
2.0,Was small and it broke before i could even use it i dont have a big help either child size maybe idk
2.0,The black part of this dress is a lot shorter than shown in the pictures. It ends just below the boobs and gives me a ugly boxy shape.
2.0,"The material is ok, I already got a hole in it and only wore maybe a few times. The clasp below in between the legs is very annoying, it's too wide so it rubs on both legs. At the time I was a Size Large and the actual body suit fit true to size!"
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like the pinkish color‚Ä¶too loud. I think I order an XL and it was too big. Returned.
2.0,"These pants are fine except for the fact that they have no pocket or belt loops. Had to return because they're slightly too big around my waist, and I can't wear them without a belt."
2.0,"They're nice tight, thick, and I don't think they're likely to get a run in them, but they have no stretch! I could barely fit myself into them and was super uncomfortable during the time in them."
2.0,Really loved the color and feel of material however it runs small around chest area . The line under the boobs is like in between which makes it look weird. Going to order a Large and see how that fits !  For reference I‚Äôm 5ft 36c and about 130
2.0,I had to return because the cut was super crooked. Idk it was not good and returned immediately.
2.0,"makes me look like I have a big nose! The seam juts out on the top and bottom and doesn't lay flat...Too bad. I like the sequins, but not happy with the fit."
2.0,My new fitbit blaze band today. A little disappointed as the frame is bent and wouldn't hold my blaze. Cant remove the pin on one side so can't even use it with my old frame. What a hassle. Will be returning.
2.0,The colors are not vibrant & the photo isn't clear. It looks purple.
2.0,Too see-through.  Not very flattering for short curvy women. Too big.
2.0,It looked a lot cheaper on than it did in the pictures. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù4‚Äô and 107lbs and ordered a small. I was too self conscious to wear it for my reception. It just looked.... cheap.
2.0,I bought a size 9 in these and they fit like a size 10-10 1/2
2.0,"I dislike the uneven tail of the dress I've ordered multiple colors in this dress but never received one with the tail like this, that's why it didn't get a five star.. I love my other dresses, I almost sent these back because of the tail!"
2.0,"I am really not impressed with this belt. When removing it from the packaging and trying it on, I noticed that my hands were starting to look black the more I handled the belt. The belt is also very thick and wide meaning it might not fit with all belt loops. From what I could tell, the belt feels and smells like real leather but I think the stain isn't the best as it left my hands black and has a funky smell.<br /><br />This belt comes in a black polyester drawstring bag that is supposed to feel silky and classy but doesn't quite. I received a 36 inch belt. The belt is almost 44"" long including the buckle, the leather portion is almost 42"" long and 1 1/2"" wide. The first hole is just short of 34"" long with holes every inch thereafter until just shy of 38"". The thickness of the leather is 3mm. I ordered this belt for my husband whose usually wears a size 36 in pants and shorts. He tried the belt on and while it did buckle on the last hole (38"") he said it was a bit tight. I'm not going to blame that on the belt since I measured him with the same measuring tape as I measured the belt and his waist is a 39 1/2"". Seems like men's clothing lines are also trying to make men feel skinnier these days. We will probably end up punching a new hole in the belt to accommodate him and have him wear it only with black pants.<br /><br />The design of the belt is very nice and has a masculine feel to it but the buckle isn't the best as the prong doesn't quite line up with the indent in the frame (as shown in the picture)."
2.0,Grunge look. OK if that‚Äôs your thing. Not mine.
2.0,I'm not to happy whit  very cheap made
2.0,"I expected a soft lemon-lime yellow like the picture-- it's actually Big Bird or school bus yellow. It came with a snag in the front. The size chart is inaccurate--it suggested an XL based on measurements but I could have used a large or even medium because it fits like a tent. The bottom of the dress doesn't taper like in the picture, but that may be because it's too big. It's also VERY polyester, almost like a Halloween costume. I'm disappointed because i'll have to return it-the design and dress shape seem like it could be very nice if in the right size and different color."
2.0,"Simply put, they are not clear. They're blurry. Makes then useless. They don't lighten enough for indoors, nor darken enough for sunlight. Bad purchase!"
2.0,The wormholes are way too big.
2.0,"When this robe arrived, I was instantly in love. Super soft and comfy! But then I washed it and everything went downhill. The first wash resulted in fine gray fuzz all over the rest of the laundry in the load. The second wash turned the fine lint into clumps that pilled up all over the robe. After a third wash I still can't get rid of the lint pills and decided to write this review. Very sad that it will never again be the robe it was when it first arrived."
2.0,"It looks nice but wen i put it on i got allergic and that happened wen i wear fake jewerly only, so i dont know..."
2.0,Doesn't fit to size but well made and super cute - had to give to<br />My daughter :(
2.0,That looked good the fit was not good for an adult female to wear
2.0,Frame wasn't just right ...but for the price I guess it was ok...
2.0,The material is very flimsy. They send a panty bottom that doesn‚Äôt match.  The color was more peach  beige.has zero stretch .
2.0,"The fabric is soft and nice, and good coverage on the back, but everything was too tight at each opening. I ended up cutting the elastic to make it work."
2.0,"The material is cheap, super light and see-through. The dress is ok for the price I guess (I got the one with ruffled  short sleeves)  but it's not nearly as nice as it looks on the pictures... I wanted to wear it to a wedding but I'll have to look for plan B. It fits well, I'm 5""3', 180 lbs and 18 weeks pregnant.. I ordered a large and it's spot on. The only problem I have is the fabric."
2.0,This was way too small and the sewing was bad.  One side was longer than the other side I just had to return it. It also didn't arrive as promised. The design is so pretty but too bad it poorly made. Hopefully its just one in the bunch.
2.0,"I bought this for my son but it didn't fit over his helmet. If you want to wear it over a helmet, go a size bigger."
2.0,Didn't hold my wife's shoulder in good posture. Costs way too much for such failure.
2.0,"I recently bought the Benyar Explorer Homage as a fun watch to wear occasionally. Right of the bat, the Benyar claims on the case to be stainless steel but many reviews have shown that to be a false claim. That alone is troubling. The accuracy of the timepiece is less than stellar as well with mine gaining about +22s every day. This makes it my least accurate mechanical watch I own. Now for the pros, the dial is very clean and Benyar has made a good looking Explorer Homage watch. The accuracy while bad isn't unwarranted for the price. My biggest gripe is the lies about case material. Overall for under $50 this isn't a bad timepiece but I'd suggest a Pagani Design or Invicta ProDiver for a bit more oppose to this is you want a mechanical watch."
2.0,Very polyester like cloth.
2.0,"It worked for approximately 3 weeks and died. It's not the battery, just stopped keeping time."
2.0,"This product will not fit properly a foot with a high arch.  Also, they are too tight."
2.0,"I ordered size 18-24 month and when I received it today, was shocked to find it was 24m. The pants are HUGE. They say 24m, but I would bet they‚Äôre bigger than that and they definitely won‚Äôt fit my son. But I don‚Äôt have another option because I need the outfit in a few days. When I checked my order, it says I ordered 24m, which I know is not correct, because my son isn‚Äôt that big yet, so it may have automatically adjusted for not having 18-24 available. But I was never notified. I‚Äôm not happy. He‚Äôll fit in it eventually, but now I‚Äôm scrambling for an outfit for our family Christmas pictures in a few days. Quality seems good. All 4 pieces included."
2.0,"True to many reviews, this necklace does look very cheap. I bought mine in the rose quartz color, and it is very plasticky. There are small details that imitate a &#34;rocky&#34; quartz feel, however. The silver colored piece on the top was poorly placed, and is sloppy. In some places, you can see the glue that brought the &#34;stone&#34; and the silver piece together.<br /><br />But, for the price paid, its a decent product, and shipped somewhat quickly."
2.0,Cute but didn‚Äôt stretch enough to fit my hand and broke after few wears
2.0,"This dress was very thin and see through.  I ordered XL I'm 5'10 180 pounds.  I couldnt even squeeze into it. I gave it to my 15 year old size 7 daughter who is 5'6 130 pounds. It fit well on her, not too tight and not too loose."
2.0,"The main part, the KISS logo is the first thing to start coming off. Would of expected a brand of this caliber would of made the lettering at least be the last thing to go.... not the first... but as per functionality, it does its job."
2.0,the cap is OK but the imprint is just cheap screenprint - not embroidered<br />The circumference of the cap is ok but the height of the cap is to short or not much room ...
2.0,"CHANGED THE COLOR,"
2.0,"Kinda flimsy materials but wasn't expecting much.  To be honest, the pipe is what really stands out as it is ridiculously scale-sized for leprechaun use!! It's literally 2 inches long at most. Fuuuaah, fuah!!"
2.0,The dress is listed as a medium but was considerably tighter than other similar dresses.in medium that I have recently purchased.
2.0,"This shirt looks great online, but it is actually pretty poor quality. The fabric is VERY thin and the shirt itself is very sheer. You can see through it worse than most sheer shirts. This one doesn't  imply being see through by the picture or the description, so be aware before you purchase. It is also pretty small in sizing. I wear a large in most tops because of my larger bust. I'm  familiar with the smaller sizing that comes with most asian clothing vendors, so to be safe, I ordered a 2X, and I'm  glad I did. It fits just right. Take these things into consideration before ordering, returning this stuff is quite a hassle. Save yourself the hassle."
2.0,Nice but does not fit an iPhone 7 + as stated.  Very nice material and lots of room and organization.  Great for a smaller phone.  Disappointed since I was going to buy several for gifts.
2.0,I bought these for my 5 small dogs to keep track of them.  I was excited to have a different color for each dog.  Unfortunately the red and pink look exactly the same when lit.<br /><br />More concerning is that the dogs are turning them on by themselves - so I wake up to blinking dogs.
2.0,"I like the leather band but the bracelet is a mess. One of the pins broke as I attempted to take a links out. The other pin got stuck and would not come out at all. The when you try to put them back in they dont go in all the way making it unattractive to look at. I could not use it all , a waste of money, poor quality."
2.0,Length good ( will b wearing w/leggings ). I don't like tops that STOP at crouch area. I didn't like that length when I was young and now at senior age still DON'T. I can layer it with sweater in winter and wear alone in spring & summer. I thought I ordered grey and got light olive. Will keep bcause I have olive leggings and booties.
2.0,Too small for any adult ankle. Wearing it as a bracelet.
2.0,The white letters are all yellowed and look old.
2.0,Didnt fit my Russian Vostok Amphibia dive watch.The band feels super cheap and flimsy. It is also very sharp when trying to attach it to my watch.
2.0,"Very good and comfortable, but the chemical odor does not get away. No treatment helps."
2.0,"Too wide and a very uncomfortable, but pretty looking."
2.0,The crotch of the pants was very  snug. I rarely come across that. And the material was far thinner than of what it looks in the picture. It also ran very long. They are a cute idea but the actual product wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting.
2.0,Is not as wide as the photos
2.0,Did not know it is a nursing top
2.0,Could not bend the prongs<br />Threw the guards away.
2.0,"Recieved this dress today, and the tag strins were caught in the zipper, plus the zipper is sewn on the outside of the dress, and given it's a cheap gold zipper, it really detracts from the look of the dress. Will be returning."
2.0,Not sticky after one use .... disappointed
2.0,"These are extremely tiny. More for a baby or toddler. If your looking for average size studs, these are not it"
2.0,"Great looking shirt! But I ordered the XL because that's my usual size, but I couldn't even get this shirt buttoned!"
2.0,"the pants looked brown and were tight all around, not a good size and heavy material"
2.0,Just a cut off piece of fabric not very warm wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Only if your a Deadpool fan like me.
2.0,The dress was cute and comfortable the first time I wore it. It shrank from a dress with a tie at the waist to an emire waisted shirt the first time it was washed. Very dissapointing.
2.0,cute but doesn't look like the picture.
2.0,"The material is very flimsy, and completely see through shows every bit of cellulite i have, due to the type of material which is thin."
2.0,"The black filled area was considerably darker on one than the other. If it weren‚Äôt for that they would be great. They‚Äôre light in your hands, but I haven‚Äôt worn them to speak for the weight on your ears."
2.0,"So it shows purplish red in the description, not the case its straight up red. So disappointed in the color. the material is like cardboard texture, but i guess for the price i shouldn't complain.Wont be buying from this company again is this is what I'm to expect."
2.0,Bust area is cut smaller thank expected.
2.0,"Boots run small. Nice styling, comfortable but my pair had a screw coming up inside the heal on left boot. I had to return."
2.0,"Too long, material is cheap and thin, not what I expected or what the photos show."
2.0,Does not reflect display
2.0,Does not look like picture at all!
2.0,Hangs like a sack
2.0,The product runs very small
2.0,Like the fabric and design.  So disappointed in the XL fitting like a Medium.
2.0,Great sunglasses but only had them for a month and the lense came out. Sad because I would have given them a better review.
2.0,The paint is literally wiped off with my finger. Cheap.
2.0,"I have always loved tiger eye stones so this bracelet was a no-brainer for me. Especially when I saw it was from Big Cat Rescue! It appears well made and the band isn‚Äôt overly stretchy. My only disappointment is the gold beads have started to tarnish, however, there are instructions to help keep this from happening (as you can guess I put the bracelet on first and didn‚Äôt read the wear instructions until later...) So overall I am pleased with my purchase!<br /><br />Update: The bracelet just broke last night. It fell right off my wrist while I was sitting on the couch. So disappointed! Only a little over a month of not even daily wear. I am just glad I was home and able to gather up all the beads so I can try to re-make it myself..."
2.0,Very cheap quality but it has a rather nice design
2.0,It was cute at first but after a week of wearing it on my vacation..... it fell apart!  :(
2.0,"Definitely not a dark charcoal color, it's literally light gray."
2.0,"The material is very, very cheap polyester that clings to the body and doesn't breathe. It feels like a swimming suit, not a summer dress.  Not wearable."
2.0,so I loved them till the night I tried to w w wear them . I was walking out the door and the rivet that connects the two back clasps broke and they fell apart... Id say spend a little more money on something not these cuz I didn't even get to wear them before they broke. also they are eta big I  6foot 6in tall or 198cm and I had to go to the first loop on them when tightening them down....
2.0,The &#34;leather&#34; strap is a bit wonky but the pendant is cool!
2.0,I expected pink and light blues but got a pretty but not what I wanted lavender and red Kimno.
2.0,"Ordered a lard and got an XL, zipper fell off after 3 washes."
2.0,The quality wasn't what I thought it would be.
2.0,Too small. The sleeves are too short and the shirt barely comes to my waist. Nice thick material though
2.0,"I was pretty excited for these for Christmas.  Sadly, I do not like these at all.  First off, I would order up.  These run very small and run low in the back area.  I wear a 2x in all of my leggings, and I could not get these on.  If you do have any stretch in the fabric, it turns white and you can see through it.  So, even if you can get them to fit but they are stretched, you will not want to wear them.  I personally do not want my leggings loose and would not wear them for just the design."
2.0,"It got gross and corroded, even though I cleaned it, quickly. But it is pretty"
2.0,"I did not get the same colors I ordered, but my kids did like the quality"
2.0,Very cute but ripped within hours of wearing them.
2.0,Dislike they are see-through pants. They should say that in the description.
2.0,its colors were not like the picture
2.0,"Ugh...ugly dress on, cheap thin polyester, sewn weird...not flattering at all.  Would've sent back but I accidentally threw the packaging away.  Oh well."
2.0,These shoes were so cute but only wore them 3 times before the bottom of the shoe came off :(
2.0,"I really loved the coat the style and color were so amazing. however I ordered one size larger than normal which was still snug. I then ordered two sizes larger and it hung at the shoulders the sleeves were too long, but too tight in the upper are arm."
2.0,"Snagged my clothes, so I couldn't wear it for the wedding I ordered it for"
2.0,"This looks like a tablecloth on,  not flattering at all"
2.0,gave it away to someone about half my size...
2.0,"Analog clock stopped working after 30 days so too late to return. Nice watch otherwise and fairly waterproof considering i barely took it off while I was at the beach for 10 days and showered every morning with it on. If I was you though, I would probably just buy the Casio Tough Solar for 10 bucks more. It should work for longer."
2.0,"I receive my order today.  Although it looks like the picture shows, I am very disappointed. I purchased it because it said satin and cotton. I really wanted it because it was sayin. However, the tag says it‚Äôs 100% Polyester. Had they mentioned that in the description I would have never purchased it. I don‚Äôt recommend purchasing this if your looking for satin. You would be disappointed like I was."
2.0,They came very quick but are not easy to use and hard to stay in place
2.0,Ordered a medium. Fits okay but small in the bust. Quality is crap. Was already falling apart right out of the package. Not impressed. I'll use it as a cover up for the beach but not what I had hoped it would be at all. I'd pass on this dress.
2.0,The Pom Pom was all squished when it arrived. I haven‚Äôt been able to get it fluffy yet. Even tried blowing it with a hairdryer. For the price I expected more.
2.0,"Ok, three were broken."
2.0,I‚Äôm typical a size 32-34B. I ordered a medium. Unfortunately they were way to small while I could put the on and zip them I literally couldn‚Äôt breathe. For not having ‚Äúbig breast‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe how tight it was.<br /><br />Returning and hoping to order a size up.<br />Will update my review once I try the next size up.
2.0,"Feels cheap, did not fit my head well (Hat Size 7.5&#34;) and did not look great."
2.0,Super small. I was able to give it to my Granddaughter and it fit her perfectly.
2.0,"The lenses were a perfect fit into my Oakley Dispute frames. The color is nice, and worked well to keep the glare and sun away. I loved them at first. But, they are not scratch resistant. My glasses stay in one of three places when not in use: on top of my head, on top of my dresser in a lined basket just for them, or on a clip on my sun visor in my car. None of these places should cause scratching, yet my lenses were completely scratched up with tiny little marks within 3 months. It looks like a brillo pad was taken to them. The funny thing is, the front side of the lenses (where the color coating is) don't even looked scratched, only when you look through them can you see it. So, it must be on the inside of the lenses...which means my hair scratched them?!?! And I have super thin and fine hair...so I just don't understand this. Basically, I got what I paid for, so next time I will be spending a bit more so they will last longer than a few months."
2.0,Follow up after 2 years this watch gets condensation in the glass . This is very upsetting.  I would of expected better resistance. I don't even go swimming or deep diving with the watch
2.0,This dress is much longer and larger than it appears to be on the model. I am 5'3&#34; and this dress goes past my knees.
2.0,"Poorly made, the chains were uneven, took forever to ship. However, it wasn't hard to adjust using a pair of jewelry pliers and i can wear it now that i fixed it myself."
2.0,I ordered 12-18 mo size and its way too small. Everything else I've bought in that age range fits him or is slightly too big. Waste of money.
2.0,The product was a little smaller than we expected. I measured it and it was 7 inches but just too small for my wife's wrist.<br />She's average hight and weight but we had to return this for a larger size.
2.0,I don‚Äôt like them after all
2.0,"It was a bit smaller in width than expected but it fit nice (size large). I liked the extra elastic bans which offered more back support. However, it isn't made of the regular ""rubber"" material to help you sweat. I received on 1/14, and wore it for the first time in 1/19 and the stitching broke and the support bar came out. Thankfully, it was wrapped otherwise it could have really hurt me. Had my husband take the photo. Overall quality isn't as sturdy. Second photo shows stitching broke in two places on the side and top."
2.0,"I ordered up after I saw reviews and the bottoms were still too big. I'm a 10 and got an XXL, I should have gotten XL."
2.0,The cups need to be closer together. The cups on this bra are closer to the rib cage than the front of the chest where the boobs are. Nothing stays in place. Otherwise very pretty colors and nice materials.
2.0,"I really liked this sweater.  It was so cozy.  But as you can see by the picture, the sleeve split within the first two weeks."
2.0,"Thin material, poor quality"
2.0,Material was thin and cheap not expected for a known brand.
2.0,Not 2x like advertise its actually a MED/LG im very disappointed my son really wanted this sweater.
2.0,I like the design and cloth but the size was bigger than what I thought
2.0,"I gave this 2 stars only, for good quality  material. I would have given it  a better rating, however I feel that this cut of design is definitely directed for women who are shorter and have more weight in the stomach/breast area. I am 5""11 and 180 lbs. Based on reviews I ordered a size up for the style shown. The bottom length came up around my belly button and the neck area came down to my elbow...instead of wasting my time sending it back I'll give it away. Not worth the money spent"
2.0,"I like the fit of these boots and the style is great. They only thing I'm worried about is that they feel as if the ""leather"" would disintegrate on contact with water. Besides this they look great and feel good on my feet.  I like that they zip up rather than have shoe laces. It just makes it that much easier to put them on and go.<br />**Update** After wearing these for a week or so I noticed that every time I walked on a smooth surface like tile, linoleum and Hardwood, that every step I took these boots would make a squeaking sound. It wasn't like it was a slight squeaking sound it was pretty loud and I could see people around me noticing how squeaky it was. At first I thought that maybe it was because they were wet from the rain. So when it kept doing it when the nice weather was here, I knew for sure that it was the boots. They are really cute and I don't mind wearing them to work because we actually have carpet throughout the office but it is a little embarrassing when walking through the grocery store and everybody's staring at you because you're shoes are squeaking so loudly. Because of this I am giving these boots 2 stars."
2.0,Blue color is not a bright blue. It looks faded. The shirts had a strange smell
2.0,This is a good quality product but the sizing is very confusing.  The XL is not even Mid.  I have to return this.
2.0,I did not like this dress. I was very disappointed. I order online quite often usually I don't have a problem. This dress does not fit properly. I considered maybe I should have gotten a smaller or larger size. Smaller would have shortened the length but made bust and waist area even tighter. Larger would have been too large and even longer. It's already too long. I'll have to spend more money and have it tailored.
2.0,Twice these pants have torn in the crotch area. I've returned one pair and now the other pair did the same thing.
2.0,Baggy in the top of the dress. Very shiny material.
2.0,It ripped on the seam the first day I wore it.
2.0,Too small order one size up
2.0,I returned this item because the fabric didn't hold its shape well and didn't perform in hot weather.
2.0,"I love this design! The colors, the concept, that it's a fairly dramatic piece... Unfortunately, it's pretty poorly made. The ""flower"" components fall off a fair amount and need to be reattached, and worse, the metal tube ""spacer"" beads in between the flowers scrape the coating off the cord everything rests on. The cord is constantly losing flakes of the coating, and with some components frequently falling off, the whole thing is made really fussy by shoddy workmanship.<br /><br />If I'm ever really going to be able to wear this necklace for a full day, I think I'm going to need to replace the cord, and then make it so the components don't really move along the cord--at the very least, the metal tube spacer beads really need to be locked down."
2.0,"It is an okay quality, but it is completely sheer!!  This is not what I am looking for. I need a dress, not a swimsuit cover."
2.0,Not what it looks like in picture. The head of the camel will not stay up.
2.0,"I don't like the way the bottom front fits. The gathering keeps it from being long to truly be tunic style as it causes it to hike up. I put  this top aside to wear around the house, but not out."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress. Fabric is good, color is great. Very wrinkly but easy fix for that. The problem is the elastic needs to be less tight and the sleeve needs to be a bit longer. Every time you bend your arm, it like pops off your elbow. it has pockets! So that‚Äôs good. But I did not love the dress. It is too big and too small at the same time."
2.0,Nice color but fits larger than expected.
2.0,Weird sizing... The triangles on the top were a little on the small end. She kept having to adjust it to make sure it was covering. The bottoms were cut kind of high in the back. Unfortunately she will not be wearing this bathing suit again :(
2.0,"I had previously rated these with 4 stars, but can't see where to change that review. My husband had reported the last couple days that the boots were keeping his feet warm. We've been above 0¬∞F. Today he is working in -1¬∞F and after a couple hours his feet are cold. Very disappointed, because these are rated for much colder.<br />They fit snug even with 1 size bigger, but not to tight with normal socks."
2.0,"This is just okay. It's cheaply made and there really isn't anything special about it. However, its a nice beach  bag and the customer service was great."
2.0,Legs on it were plenty long but body was pretty short. Couldn‚Äôt even wear it once :(
2.0,It's huge and one is bigger then another and very heavy
2.0,"Looks good but the word &#34;Polarized&#34; that's printed on the left lense is a killer for me. It makes me feel there's a smudge at the top of my glasses. Although the bamboo looks great, it's a bit too thick. The top of my ears feel sore after a while of wearing these. Otherwise a decent pair of shades."
2.0,My wife‚Äôs review:<br /><br />Not flattering makes you look like a grandma. Ewww just not nice at all.
2.0,"I like it, would like to wear it but it is too small. I was formerly an XXL and have lost 35 lbs. I am now an XL and ordered the XL. Nope. Fits like a L. When I get down to that size, I'll see if this fits but the sizing is misleading. It wont even zip."
2.0,Too tight and lightweight.
2.0,material is terrible. Its like feeling a...a....umm i dont know...just dont like it!
2.0,To Small around the arms and too transparent
2.0,Aun no recibo el producto.
2.0,"The look and polarization is great for the price. However, mine broke after only wearing a few times."
2.0,"Not thrilled with the quality of these masks at all!  Thin, cheaply made, easy to tear, easy to rip, fit fine on my 7 year olds face, comfy thin breathable material but probably won't last long at all for the price I say skip these not a great purchase at all"
2.0,"I'm so disappointed. I saw the pretty pictures from other customers and good reviews so I was confident this was a good buy. I bought this dress for my daughter for Easter, which is 4 days away and I get the dress and it's missing the sash. So around the waist of the dress you can see where the tulle is tied.... did I mention Easter is in 4 days and I need a gold dress?"
2.0,Fit as expected but the material is soooooo cheap!
2.0,I bought an XL and I usually wear a size 12 and I couldn't even get them on.
2.0,"I loved the gloves, first set were a gift that was too small. Got a size 8 in exchange, BUT  the right glove was an 8 & the left one was a 7.5! NOT a happy camper right now and the return process on this set has been nothing less than a hassle. Very unlike Amazon! I wonder what is up...getting too busy, or too lazy or what."
2.0,They slip off my head
2.0,I did not love this sweater. Half way down the sweater is a design that is hard to tell in the pictures online. It also had a very strong smell of vinegar.
2.0,Way too small had to give it to my daughter
2.0,Talk about a drop crouch! These things were WAY too big in the waist and fell off of me.
2.0,"Yes, it's super big but that also means it won't fit into a cup holder which then means it's difficult to keep it stable while in the car.  This is important as it absolutely will leak as soon as it's tipped over.  I bought this for my husband who's in construction.  He tried a variety of things, from bungee cords to duct tape, until finally he'd had enough and tossed it into the dumpster.  If they could fix this design flaw it might really be a great thermos but until then it's really only proven to be a huge inconvenience.  It's sad because it really is a lovely looking design."
2.0,"Beautiful, but breaks very easy! Had mine for a week and I fixed it twice, the third time it broke it fell off somewhere. Lost forever."
2.0,"The waist fit was a perfect match.However, given the product photo, I anticipated a longer inseam 11inch or more.It measured closer to 8 inches"
2.0,"These run extremely small. It's to bad I have to return them because they are really cute and from what I seen, made pretty well.<br /><br />I was offered this item for a reduced price to leave the seller my HONEST review, in which I have done.<br />I will not leave a good review for a bad product regardless of discount. It in no way influences my judgement or opinion."
2.0,Super cute but some Fly London are super comfy and some hurt my feet. These fell into the latter category :-(.<br /> You need to try them on yourself to be sure.
2.0,A little small and bled in the rain...for shame.
2.0,Cheap looks like a toy watch
2.0,looked too ‚Äúmature‚Äù for my 6 & 12 yr old.
2.0,These are HUGE! They appear cute from the pics but are shockingly massive. Returned them after receiving.
2.0,"The colors don‚Äôt match those of the picture. I ordered the rose gold and it looks Orange bronze. The rose is fluorescent pink. I ordered the smaller size and it‚Äôs toddler size, really really small."
2.0,"Me & my husband share an Amazon account so I ordered this off of his name... My first reaction after opening the package was wow this is huge and clunky, it wasn't what I expected. The cards aren't easily accessible. It's hard to pull out cards and put them back after use. I end up just throwing my card back in my purse along with the wallet. After a day use of this wallet I switched back to my old one."
2.0,doesn't clip on well and hard to handle
2.0,It's cute but it's too small or my head is too big. LOL
2.0,"The image made the baroque pearl look the size of a fireball and the dimensions listed appeared to confirm this, however, when I received this pearl it was much smaller. It's nice, but thought I was purchasing something much larger than what arrived."
2.0,Look nice easily to break and change color
2.0,The background is NOT clear White.  it is like Grey color background.
2.0,Its advertised embellished cuffs but mine came with nothing on it. When I contacted manufacturer they said customers complained about the cuffs so they are no longer embellishing them!! Yet not one of your reviews mentioned that....Its going back asap!!
2.0,Bought two sizes larger because of the reviews and still could barely get it over my shoulders. I really like the coat but I have to return it.
2.0,The product fit as expected but the material is really cheap
2.0,"Well, I did receive the watch within 7-10 business days, which is considered a &#34;professional and timely business transaction. However, when I received it in the mail I opened the package and discovered (actually, the first thing I saw) was this huge face staring back at me with a white band. Now, I am telling you this watch has a huuuuuuuge face! I have a very small wrist and I usually purchase watches that are petite looking; this watch is not! I have been told the watch looks manly on my wrist. Women, if you are petite and have a small wrist and you like to see your wrist and not this huge, gigantic watch face staring back at you, don't purchase the watch. I do still wear the watch because I paid for it...but plan on getting a different style."
2.0,neck opening is tiny.
2.0,"Bought this as a gift.<br /><br />Was a bit flimsy.  Look at the picture though, i mean, I knew what i was in for.<br /><br />Not as stunning as the other reviewer let on.  Not sure what expensive baubles are (and I refuse to google it) but I know the person i bought this watch for has never taken it out of the junk drawer after the first day."
2.0,This would be a great product If I had a smaller chest. I wear a size G (DDD) bra and the crop tank top is more like a small bra that squishy me out. I wish they made it in a bigger size. I bought a size 12
2.0,I normally wear a small and went up one size after reading other reviews....I should have gone up to a large or even xl.  The top is so snug its uncomfortable and the material has no give to it (synthetic).  It is a cute shirt if you get it two sizes larger but it does not breath at all due to the material so makes wearing during summer uncomfortable.  I would opt for one with better fabric.
2.0,"These are cute and awfully fun, but the charging plug/power switch pokes out right into the ankle, and rubbed into a bloody mess on my daughter's foot so she never wore them after the first time."
2.0,"The watch stains your wrist after wearing it for a couple days,"
2.0,looked ok was to small for her hand
2.0,Super cute but is see through. Not a comfortable material either. I returned both pair that I bought.
2.0,these shoes definitely run small as other reviews indicated...i purchased a half size up and was disappointed.  i would not recommend these shoes to anyone.  they are flimsy and not very durable<br /><br />i received these shoes at a reduced fee in exchange for my unbiased review of the product
2.0,I had to return this because the fit was nowhere near as described. This was entirely too tight. Looked cute but no good in the fit particularly in the chest area.
2.0,Picture looks better than they are and they broke within a week.
2.0,"Usually I love Carters clothes because they last well, but this one just didn't hold up to normal wash and wear. The blue fabric started to look faded and felt unusually stiff after a handful of wears, and eventually went in the trash before the baby outgrew it."
2.0,"I'm always on the look out for skirted bathing suits. This has peplum on the top as well as a meshed cut out at the neck and breast areas. I'm an 8/10 and the top was tight.  When I put it on , i felt it more suited the ice rink than swimming pool."
2.0,"My kids loved these initially, were worn twice for 30 minute swim lessons. Neither kid removed the goggles, and afterward I put them into their bag. But after removing them the second day, I noticed all lenses were foggy, I wiped them with a 100% cotton cloth, and they scratched immediately. Returned them."
2.0,This is the third ring I have purchased from this company.  I am really disappointed in the quality of the band.  I love my other rings from this company and hope this band was just a one off.
2.0,I'm a petite women and can barely get it over my head. I've decided to let my westie dog wear it as a neck gator. Lol<br />It is very cute. ;)
2.0,"Flimsy for the price and vastly too small.  I ordered a 2xlarge. The coat I received is labeled 3xlarge . I don't know who this company is consulting about sizing for the U.S. market but they were clueless. This coat is a standard American large, not 3x large. I guess their size small will only fit a one year old. Don't bother unless you are short and small.<br /><br />Edit: Since leaving this review I have been contacted twice by someone claiming to represent the seller offering me gift cards in exchange for removing this review."
2.0,Very cute. Loved them for the week I had them. Cheaply made. The side piece snapped off with in a week.
2.0,"this case fit everything very well, but the plastic/gasoline smell got to me so bad I had to buy a different case. It made everything around it smell bad and gave me a headache any time i opened it. reading the reviews I didn't think it would be that bad but it really is. If you can get past that this is the perfect size case, but do be aware that the smell is really bad. my only other thing would be the red text on the handle is a little ugly to me, but if you don't care about that or are somehow immune to this smell, then by all means it's a good case"
2.0,"I like wearing leggings-- especially those that are ""different"" in some way. I ordered these because they are different-- and they look amazing online. Unfortunately, when mine came they ended up being capris, not full-length. Other than that, the material felt great, the product was made well, etc. As capris, however, they looked totally different, so I sent them back. :(<br /><br />They took them back and credited my account right away, so the customer service is 5 stars, in my opinion."
2.0,The description says at top ‚Äúsaffiano leather‚Äù. That‚Äôs what I looked at when purchasing. Can‚Äôt believe I spent $40 on a plastic purse.
2.0,The socks hit about 2 inches below my knees- not knee high! Very disappointing.
2.0,"Material to thin,"
2.0,All other Toms were true to size and these were too big. They were wider in the heel than other size 8 Toms I have purchased.
2.0,It was advertised as red ‚Äî it is orange.  It is not an XL size.  I did not like the feel of the fabric .  I am very disappointed because I loved the look of it  On the computer. I will be returning it.
2.0,Esta a la medida es comodo pero al enrollarse es inc√≥modo
2.0,Cute design but the style makes me look pregnant
2.0,I liked these for about 2 weeks. Now the lenses keep coming loose and slipping off. They pop back in place but then pop off again with activity
2.0,I wore them even though I didn't like them.
2.0,"The chain says 18‚Äù, and it‚Äôs definitely not. It‚Äôs 16‚Äù, and that is when using the 2‚Äù extender. The way the necklace is designed, you can‚Äôt even swap the chain out for a longer one. It seems pretty flimsy for being $30. Especially because the pendant itself is tiny."
2.0,ordered this for myself but gave it to a child. it was too small/tight for my head.
2.0,"Very cheaply made. Not worth the price. Giving it away to someone that wants it to bum around in, as I dont feel like going to the post office, which is ridiculous. I should be able to just put it in my mail box for the postal carrier to pick up ."
2.0,it peeled after being worn a few times
2.0,The first one I put in broke within 5 minutes....
2.0,They broke pretty fast.
2.0,"Seams don't match up and one side of the front is 1.5&#34; longer than the other and it is unhemmed with a ragged edge along the bottom. I decided not to return it but unsewed/resewed the front then hemmed it, a task that took about as long as sewing a similar top from scratch. Although the fabric is much stiffer than I expected, I liked the look of it enough to go through the trouble of making it wearable rather than return it."
2.0,I gave it a two star instead of a one-star because my son who is 15 and a huge anime fan adores these pendants. However it's absolutely ridiculous what he has to go through to change the pendant on the chain. He actually has to use a needle nose pliers. Clearly something's not right. The little round metal Circle that holds the pendant to the chain is not big enough. The end of the chain cannot slip through the circle so therefore he has to use a needle-nose plier to bend open the circle in order to put it on the chain. So ridiculous. Junk.
2.0,"Went with Large, should have gone with Small. Hopefully a wash and dry will shrink them some."
2.0,You get what you pay for with these. They are cheap and look mediocre
2.0,I returned it. My husband has a large head and even the large was small on me. It's also a very light material not more of a thick wool which I was expecting
2.0,Returned because not as soft as the Capri style that I have from the same brand that I love. Just feels not comfy.
2.0,"I didn't realize the armpit section is cut out.  not sure how I missed that.  This dress is a nice thick material and pretty color, but this style just didn't wok for.  The sleeve also seemed to poof up a bit at the top on the shoulder.  It is a very pretty dress, it just wasn't a good look or fit for me."
2.0,"I really liked my customizable v-neck short sleeve shirt.  Right up to the 3rd time washing the shirt.<br />I found a long thread wrapped around the rest of the garment. It was the shirt sleeve hem, completely unraveling and no longer hemmed.<br />Frankly, I expect more than being laundered 3 times to destroy a shirt-especially a $30.00 shirt!<br />Sure, it fit well. But the sleeves were shorter than I like.  And, the unraveling hem. I don‚Äôt think I can recommend this clothing."
2.0,I ordered the color brown and got this...feels nice but wrong color
2.0,Not good quality.  Frame gets hot in your car
2.0,"Disliked how light  the knot was. It had no shape, and it fell apart ."
2.0,"Love the look of this watch.  The silicone chain looks pretty cool and the face is easy to read.  But it barely fits my wrist (way tight).  I'm a nurse, so I need to be able to pull it up to wash my hands since it's not even marked as being splash resistant.  My biggest complaint about it, though, is that it isn't accurate.  I kept having to reset it all day because it kept losing time.  It usually runs about 15-20 minutes slow. Would return it if I hadn't already worn it."
2.0,"I love the style and size of this wallet, It fit my Galaxy S9+ with a gator case inside perfectly and zipped up so it stayed safe.  The problem is that the ""Pink Vinyl"" chipped off within 3 days as shown in the picture.  I am too anal to live with this case as it looks like crap."
2.0,Way small. Feels like it's cutting off circulation under ribs
2.0,Not cute. It looks like a fleece leotard. I‚Äôm a smaller but so keeping it in place on the shoulders is rather interesting- I see a costum failure in my future. Recommend tape. But the mater is to thick and the rouching looks tacky. Decent for costum piece not for a formal event.
2.0,Nice material but sewing on straps fell apart on both items I ordered. A quick needle and thread and all seems well.
2.0,This is suppose to be an ear crawler but it fall off my ear and hangs at a weird angle.
2.0,Shipping was fast but cord broke after the first week. I have yet to find a cord that could replace it.
2.0,"It's a decent watch as watches go, but the description is for a boys/girls watch. However, it is huge and even looks big my husband who is 6 ft tall  & 200#. It is NOT a child's size watch. It is made for a large man's wrist."
2.0,"Compass is inaccurate. Finds ""north"", but East South and West are all off by at least 10 degrees. Buying something else."
2.0,Not the best quality. The nose pads were not attached evenly and were loose.
2.0,"Very cute, but had a sad little girl cause they sent the wrong size. I double checked I put the right size and they sent a different size than what I ordered. Tried to contact someone about it but never heard back. Very disappointing"
2.0,too difficult to get fastened.
2.0,"Overall, I loved the color and style of this pack, but the straps were very uncomfortable and I couldn't figure out how to adjust them and get them to stay. The snaps on the straps were low quality and every time I put the pack on they unsnapped. The logo sticker is big and I was planning on removing it if I kept the pack, but I returned."
2.0,Like the band and scrunched but as I suspected would happen with the scrunchie it‚Äôs stretched out and takes more times around my bun now to actually hold in place.
2.0,Wouldve been perfect in an entire size larger than my normal size
2.0,"The tights for as expected and seemed to be good quality, but we found a hole on the leg within the first hour of wear. It was just a normal dance class and there was no reason for it to have torn."
2.0,Returned too small kids socks
2.0,"Bought this for my teen driver. This is really cute and very functional for someone who doesn‚Äôt want to carry. Purse. The light pink color is very pretty.Unfortunately the lobster claw type clasp on the end broke within 6 months of use, making it unusable."
2.0,"I like the cut and length of this dress, but it's a bit on the see through side. The seams are starting to fray after a couple of washes. Also the pockets are really small and constantly come out. Can't put anything in them. Very comfy dress but wouldn't wear it out much."
2.0,"Very pretty, but a bit tight.  They snag way too easily,  making them not so pretty anymore.  Wouldn't purchase more."
2.0,I ordered a size up just in case and it still ended up being WAY too small
2.0,"Just received this jacket 2 weeks ago and wrist and waist elastic banding is already coming apart.<br /><br />At first I thought the jacket was too small. Product is starting to mold to my body.  I just wish the wrist & waist area didn‚Äôt look so worn & torn !!<br /><br />I really love the jacket, Is this even fixable?"
2.0,"Got this for my son for Christmas. He put it on, fit great and liked it. However within a few hours the straps. Some out of the clasp and broke."
2.0,"Does not stay on, I put it on and it smudges and goes away before I can really get the lashes to stay"
2.0,Not the best quality. But cute style.
2.0,Jewelers was very cheap looking not at all like pictured.
2.0,As soon as we opened it and unfolded the glasses one of the lens fell out. I was able put it back but with great effort.
2.0,"I was disappointed by this product. I received it for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback. It says it's a size 34B but it is SO loose. It seems like it was stretched out or something (it wasn't - but that's just what it feels like). Even with the removable straps on, it's too loose. This definitely is not accurate sizing or something I could ever use as a strapless bra. Size down if you're looking to purchase this. The shape on the cups feels a little off too. Like, almost pointy. You're better off just running to the store and grabbing something you can size and feel the fit immediately. I wouldn't purchase this one."
2.0,"the pattern great.....the fabric, great for swimming.<br />The photo is not the same as what I got. DONT BUY THIS"
2.0,"Zipper is on the left side, hood cord broke the first time used."
2.0,Not as cute as the picture. It‚Äôs like wearing a square box with no shape. The material is to heavy to even make it lay cute and baggy
2.0,Very cute. Nice material but This suite is not made for 5‚Äô9 girls.
2.0,"Took a gamble and ordered this because it was so inexpensive, but you get what you pay for- quality is not very good."
2.0,Wings start to come apart when wearing
2.0,Cheaply made. The tooth is way to big for the necklace and had a hole at the bottom.
2.0,quality cheap
2.0,The quality on what's expected
2.0,colour was too dull not as dark as shown in the picture..and fit too large I am 5'6&#34; and ordered M size.. small would have been better
2.0,The dress I got sent was not the color of the picture and the fit was way off.
2.0,"This pair I received felt a size too small, very narrow."
2.0,"Super super cute, but but very thin and zero grip on carpet.  I can't wear to Pure Barre, which is what I bought them for. Works great on hardwood...too bad I only workout on carpet. :("
2.0,This came way bigger than expected. Wrong measurements and wrong fittings
2.0,This is more of a stylish piece than one that actually holds pants up.
2.0,Great comfort but fell apart after a few washes
2.0,"Material not so stretchy, i pulled on one side and it ripped"
2.0,Was a jean material like a jean jacket and fits small.  Had to return it but return was very easy to do.
2.0,"Of you're looking for the well made sushi cats, these are not it. If you don't have any sushi cats and have no set standard then these will be fine."
2.0,They are really cute but my belly turned green in a day smh
2.0,"They are very cute, but also super flimsy and they turned my ears green so they are not real sterling silver. Very disappointed."
2.0,Sized real small
2.0,The material was cheap and see through. Didn‚Äôt look like as nice in person. Not worth $30.
2.0,Junk....junk....junk...barely fit any of the adults. Gave to the kids
2.0,Just doesn‚Äôt fit right.
2.0,It worked for a few days but then the front zipper kept getting stuck. It became really annoying because I was at Disney where they open every pocket of every bag so I had to stop using it. Very disappointed.
2.0,The picture shows a Sean down the middle of the mask. There is no seam
2.0,Bought a large based on the sizing grid but it was way to large in the arm holes.  Good length but material was really thin.  Wish it had been lined also b/c it definitely would have needed a slip or something if i'd worn it instead of returned it. Very sad to return b/c i was otherwise in love with this dress.
2.0,These arrived with three different backs and none of them actually fit. The posts bent easily and broke. Cute earrings but not worth the price.
2.0,it is too small for my ray bans but I already used it so I‚Äôm stuck with it what I‚Äôm going to do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2.0,"update: took this to Maui and wore it oce at the beach. Got a sunburn on my body underneath. Since I just finished radiation treatment and need to avoid sun exposure, this suit was a bust. I can wear it and carry an umbrella, like I did the first few times, but protection, nope.<br /><br />This looks adorable and feels comfortable. I get compliments every time I wear this."
2.0,"Not what I was expecting, I could make it work with the right pair of leggings or jeans and some cute boots but I'm not very excited about it.  Not worth what I paid for the quality."
2.0,"Wanted a shorter heel for work....thought these were cute. When I first got them I was happy (last shoe I purchased on Amazon were too small so be warned take the measurements in the guide seriously).  Until I wore them out to work, then I discovered why cheaper isn't always better.  They were pretty uncomfortable as I could feel just about every little pebble or anything that was on the floor.  I also realised that the ruffles were starting to peel and this was the second wear.  I have had cheap heels before which did not hurt as bad.  Guess if you work for a three or four hour day these may be ideal - not for me though...."
2.0,There was no in-between sizes. So these were way too big.
2.0,"The body sizing was fine, but the design has very tight neckline & armholes making it binding & uncomfortable. I don't think sizing up would fix the issue, as then it would be too large everywhere else. Otherwise, this would have been a great top!"
2.0,It was not what I was expecting.
2.0,Not very attractive.  I won't wear it.
2.0,"El vestido es muy bonito. Lo ped√≠ talla M pero es muy peque√±o.  El material no era lo que esperaba, se ve muy barato.  Lo voy a devolver."
2.0,"I read reviews prior to purchasing and ordered a size up. Bottoms are a little snug but they fit. Top is waaaay too big tho, which I don't understand because I read a review of a girl the same bra size as me that ordered a large, a size bigger than what I ordered, and said hers fit perfectly. Is there any way I can return top for a smaller size or do I have to order another suit in a size small?"
2.0,This product is not true to size.  The product was way too small!
2.0,"I've worn it the black dye comes off a bit onto my fingers (mostly visible around my nails).  At first I thought it was just due to it being new, as some clothing items will do that. BUT after several wears + washes  (tried both air dry and machine dry) it still does it.  (I've only washed it with dark/black items so I cannot confirm nor deny if it transfers to other clothes in the wash)<br /><br />Comfortable fit, comfortable material.. hate that it isn't color fast."
2.0,Its loose in some areas and just right in others...and it sorta rides up doesn't like lay flat against ur chest and waist area like a regular crop top
2.0,These are cute by very thin - could not wear for COVID protection
2.0,Very disappointed. The attachments accessories do not fit in the purse. It‚Äôs hard to insert the phone.
2.0,Can not make it smaller. The tool that came with it doesn‚Äôt work. Necklace is very pretty but won‚Äôt lay flat because it can‚Äôt be made smaller.
2.0,Shows my side boobs for some reason and looks really odd and boxy. The cut is just weird.
2.0,"Pearl are not white, more off white."
2.0,Loved the design but the band broke kinda easily not sure why was very disappointed.
2.0,Shirt doesn't fit like it should at all!!!! Ordered a 3x and it fits like an Xlarge. Guess it's a good thing I am trying to lose weight so I don't waste my money lol.
2.0,"He said it looked too &#34;Bro&#34; - whatever that means!  He does not wear it. Wish I had ordered a thinner chain but if you want a bigger, macho looking one, order this. It is good quality and arrived quickly."
2.0,"I know what ""compression"" means! This is not a first time bought compression tops. With 5.3"" always size S, weight &lt;130lbs. Description of product is definitely mislead! after wears & washes those are not as described! Just a normal long sleeve T-shirt, fabrics really thin and cheap made.<br /><br />Only size ""SM"" and IS NOT A COMPRESSION - loose fitting<br />NOT SUN PROTECTION<br />NO MOISTURE WICKING"
2.0,This was gorgeous and it worked effectively as a ring holder but it was such flimsy metal that it bent as I took it out of the box. I know I'm a little rough sometimes and it wouldnt have lasted.
2.0,Too small.  Will need to try again.  Next sixe
2.0,It wasn't a typical large.  I'll be returning it
2.0,"The pack contains 3 leggings, however the sizes are all over the place. My pack has 1 large, 1 medium and 1 small."
2.0,Does it fit my six month old head. Even though I got the smallest size. But will be wearing it when he gets older
2.0,Sheer and showed every little bit of cellulite you might have. Soft though and liked the design.  Returned.
2.0,"Described as a 'embroidered' cap. It is not. It has a crooked, cheap looking sticker on the front. 2/10 do not recommend."
2.0,Washed up ok w no shrinking but this is weird thick material for a tank top
2.0,I returned this item because I didn't like the material.  It seemed too thin and didn't stretch at all.
2.0,Just got it and had white stuff all over it ... not happy
2.0,fits okay. makes the nose sore and falls off face if you tip forwarder
2.0,I like the length and feel of the fabric. What I didn‚Äôt like is that the elastic inside the waist band twisted and I can‚Äôt get it to lay flat anymore. It makes these uncomfortable with it twisted.
2.0,"Runs small so beware! Product was delivered quickly HOWEVER the item itself is poor quality front is completely see through, strings are coming out of the sides and I have just taken it out of the packaging"
2.0,I liked at first but the stretchy waist band didn't last long.
2.0,"Please note: Seller does not accept returns! Nothing is wrong with the chain, but  I just didn't realize that it might scratch my glasses. The silver is a bit rough so putting chain around your neck and then taking it off for awhile is tricky as the silver is a bit slippery and rough.  My glasses are prescription and I can't afford to scratch them."
2.0,was not described properly
2.0,The cufflink is great but the water in the level is clear rather than green.  I will send them back.
2.0,Bought it for my 8 year old for a Harry Potter birthday party. The seems started to rip after the first day. It was not sewn very well.
2.0,"I bought this bikini for a vacation and it arrived on time and in package! Unfortunately, the bikini is very cheaply made. I moved the adjustable straps to the tightest setting and the top was still loose. It also looked very tacky having the hardware for the straps visible in front. The bottoms are just basic with full coverage. Not very forgiving or flattering around the seams. Very little stretch to the bikini at all. I‚Äôm usually a small but I ordered a medium and it was pretty true to size but tight in all the wrong places."
2.0,It was cute but more like a shirt then a dress.
2.0,omg! I used it for 3 days and it burst. Delivery was also late
2.0,"It‚Äôs a cool looking watch, but it is for a really small wrist. Had to return it."
2.0,"This tank was the perfect fit, until I dried it. It literally shrunk to a child size length. I've never seen anything like it."
2.0,"Came wrinkly, looks like a sheet with straps."
2.0,I was going to wear this for my bridal shower. The Ruffle is like a foam fabric. It was way too small and I normally wear a medium. Very cute for a less curvy person.
2.0,Wrinkled
2.0,The product description said that the waist sizes for large would accommodate men with a 34 to 37 waist. I have a 35 and they were simply too tight even so.  This is an obvious error and should be corrected.  After reading comments from other shoppers it became obvious that I should have read the comments prior to ordering the product!!
2.0,It is two sizes too big.
2.0,"I was looking for a 20"" necklace.  Description say 18"" + 2"", but it's actually 18"" at it's max."
2.0,Nothing special.  Cheap lookiing
2.0,Unfortunately two out of the three stopped working within 3 weeks of using them once a day.
2.0,"Looked like a great umbrella, but it began to rust after using it only ONE time. Unbelievable!"
2.0,Neither pair had progressive lenses. Very disappointed in these. Made in China
2.0,Not what i was expecting but it‚Äôs ok
2.0,"You get what you pay for, it's very thin material not bra straps like I thought, looks ok"
2.0,Sleeves are short even when I sized up x3
2.0,"Stitching busted when placing money inside on the right hand edge.  Looks good, leather fine, sew job is lacking on interior.  Sending it back is of course not feasible."
2.0,Came missing two very important medals...AGAIN.  missing the St Benedict Medal and the Crucifix
2.0,Cute and all but too tight for my baby.
2.0,No support at all. Just for pretty. It couldnt handle even walking on the  elliptical.  Unfortunately I have more support and less movement from my daily bra. I do not recommend this for  anything other than another layer under your shirt.
2.0,They weren't tall enough to keep the rain out
2.0,"This bra is cute but it's not a true 36 size. It's more a 32-33. The bust is close together for my fame as a 36, (my breast looked pushed together), compared to my natural frame. Yes it does have the lift. I wish this bra had a true sizing chart. I don't recommend."
2.0,"Purchased these about three months ago. I really wanted to love these pants. In the long run they have disappointed. Newly washed, they fit well overall; however, by mid-day I am constantly having to pull them up.  Annoying to the point that I can't wait to take them off.  Also, disappointed in the 'straight' leg description. In my opinion they are boot cut.  No I would not recommend them to a friend.  Sadly my search continues..."
2.0,"Cute design, something different. There's not much swing to the dress - it just sort of falls and clings. The material is not what i expected.  We hit 100 degree plus days during the summer, and i think i would feel the heat in this. Also, purchase a larger size - it runs small. I gave it to my friend's daughter."
2.0,A bit disappointed. The bags are super thin to the point that you can see the contents of the bag. Will not order again. Not even worth the hassle of returning.
2.0,These were good quality but way too big for my 6 year old in first grade
2.0,Didn't work for me. The foam padding on the inside of the glasses is way to small. Most did not come in contact with my face and would not prevent dirt and dust from entering. Fogged up quickly as well.
2.0,No tiene para nada el largo que indica la foto
2.0,It is very pretty but was disappointed that it shows that it had two sides and what I got delivered was a single opening for the price was not right!!!!!!
2.0,bad quality leather
2.0,Delivered super late was uncomfortable and big
2.0,It‚Äôs a little disfigured and deformed.
2.0,You size down in this item and I got the tan color and it was a little bit sheer not too too bad but it is comfortable I did not like that it looks bunch in the croch area at all I got small I'm 129 pounds and 5 foot 7and in the pants I definitely need a xs and the jacket i could wear a xs but would like to keep a s but u can't don't that way but over all it is comfortable and I'm going to keep it and see what washing and drying it really good does for it its not that bad but it not worth the price at it at most its worth like 15 bucks that's it so don't pay this price for this
2.0,"POS! Fit great, but scratched in two months... only 100% wipes were used..."
2.0,"Not really happy with this. It‚Äôs too big and it‚Äôs a very heavy polyester. It looks very matronly, almost frumpy.  also a longer hemline than in the picture. I‚Äôm going to try and shorten it."
2.0,"This is a nice skeleton watch for the price, just be extremely careful with it.  The glass is in no way durable. Within the first few days of owning the watch it had fallen off the bathroom sink and the back glass shattered when it hit the floor.  A linoleum floor, not even tile. Bits of glass ended up in the gears and stopped it from running."
2.0,The image is printed off center on the shirt I received. I loved the design concept but the reality is that I won‚Äôt wear it much because it‚Äôs poorly placed on the shirt. :(
2.0,overall poor quality.  upper separated from sole almost immediately.
2.0,"slightly bigger than expected, they broke in a matter of weeks."
2.0,"They were comfortable, but they are way too long for me and reach up to my chest"
2.0,Described as having a zipper closure...it does not!
2.0,"I don't think I can actually wear these earrings. The dangles clank around too much and the materials are noisy when this happens. I think it‚Äôd be too distracting during any social interactions, etc."
2.0,Too big and wasn't pleased with the material.
2.0,"I got an XL from reading the reviews thinking it would be better to be a little big. It bordered on being too small. Go a couple sizes up from what you would normally wear. I also thought it would be silky fabric but it's not silky and it's not cottonny. It's OK, but it's a little heavier than I was expecting. It's kind of a weird fabric."
2.0,"Keeps good time, but without a band it is now useless.  I have looked all over for their warranty dept. but it obviously does not exist."
2.0,"I like the concept, but they fit super weird. The underneath shorts were long but the outer layer was super short and tight and kept riding up. I have large thighs and I wouldn't recommend these to anyoneelse that does."
2.0,"Ran small, should have bought the 2XL, I bought the top in 2XL, and that JUST fit him, and he normally wears a XL."
2.0,It was a cute dress but the fit just didn't work for me. The bottom fit great but the top was loose. If I had gotten a smaller size the bottom would have been too tight to be appropriate for work.<br />I ordered the lemon print and it is really see through. I would suggest a darker color.
2.0,"I guess I'm going to have to return this, can't find anywhere to contact the seller directly. Got this for a Christmas gift for my son and he was SO excited because it's always cold in their school. Only had it two weeks and the vest will no longer turn on. Not a good buy at all if this is a normal occurrence."
2.0,The keychain seems to be good quality but the product I was received did not match the picture of the keychain I ordered.
2.0,The necklace was too long
2.0,"Earring backs don‚Äôt stay on, they are flimsy, but cheap, so what can one expect. Good for costumes, nice colors"
2.0,The white/ under part of the bottoms show
2.0,I did not like the material it was like microfiber shrunk and tore easily
2.0,"This should not be described as a sweat suit. It‚Äôs very cheap, nearly see through polyester. I don‚Äôt know about 65% cotton. My son normally wears an 8/10 and I got him the Large 9/10. The top fits fine. The pants are a little big but will work. There‚Äôs no information about washing. Not on the description or on tags. The only tags say ‚Äù150‚Äù. So cheap. I must admit my son still looks cute in it but I expected something completely different, especially for the price. I paid for the the fact that it has Among us on it which I highly doubt was even legally used."
2.0,I was very upset on 4th of July I wanted to get dressed and look festive! Well the shirt came and it‚Äôs too big. It fits to big but they say it‚Äôs a small. This is big on me all I know it can‚Äôt be a small I don‚Äôt wear it!
2.0,"Flimsy zip, be careful the little tab at the end is engaged before zipping, otherwise the zip can come undone from the wrong side and is a nightmare to get back to normal. Wind resistance is OK but water resistance is minimal to non-existent, soaked through in minutes in light rain."
2.0,Bought one and wore to my softball tournament after getting off shift at the plant. Had some beers with the guys during the game (who doesn‚Äôt?) next thing I know the watch stopped working.<br /><br />Lesson: ‚ÄúWater resistant‚Äù is different than ‚ÄúBeer resistant‚Äù.
2.0,One set broke within days of my grandson using them.
2.0,"See through, flimsy, weird fit, tacky embroidery, sleeves much shorter than in the picture."
2.0,Ran extra small for a 2xl fit like a large
2.0,Nice quality but buckle is bronze or like rose gold. Brown belt has different end then black one. Why did I ordered 2. Big mistakes and would like to return. Also ordered bigger size in brown but both came as same size.
2.0,"I was impressed with this bag at first other than the strong chemical odor. It was purchased as a work bag, one I could walk downtown in the city hands free. It worked well, but after day 4, I was wearing the bag and the strap clips snapped. There wasnt even very much in the bag yet, keys, wallet, and gum.<br /><br />If you have no interest in the crossbody strap the bag is fine. The odor still lingers a little, but not too bad."
2.0,Top fit great and even though I do have a big butt this thing was hanging off. Im too short for it. Needed a longer torso for it to look right.
2.0,I bought this in mid Feb to change out my daughter earrings and this weekend the latch broke off !
2.0,This jacket runs large. And the ruffles on the bottom give it a maternity look.
2.0,"Love the light weight material and style, however I ordered a xlarge hoping it would fit a bit loosely.  I read several reviews said fit as expected.  I normally wear a large ordered a Xlarge to be safe.  It is more tappered fitted cut and is tight...  I will end up altering.."
2.0,"I loved these. Wore daily for a few weeks only indoors on carpet. I sit a lot, btw. Video games and knitting encourage that. Then the bottom rubber wore through and tore less than two months in. That ‚Äòthick rubber sole‚Äô is a fake out and less than a 1/4 inch thick overlay on some white material.<br /><br />I‚Äôm bummed and my search for a decent house shoe continues. They were fantastic in every other respect ‚Äî comfort, fit, style."
2.0,"The fit is okay, a little higher cut at the neck than expected. I'm 5'7"", 135 lbs and I got a large, after washing it, it fits about right. I like the dress, but BEWARE the olive color is a light army green, not the dark beautiful green it looks like in the pictures. Pretty disappointed in the color, it's the only green color offered."
2.0,Too narrow for groceries
2.0,Have owned the purse around 6 months.. the lining has holes and swallows my stuff.  I am not hard on purses so this is ridiculous.  It is enormous as well.
2.0,poor quality - magnet cover came off after a few uses
2.0,Beautiful dress but I ordered my exact size and it did not fix correctly. The design kind of comes up too high and looks weird. A belt may fix the awkward line. Just disappointed I can‚Äôt wear it to a wedding I had intended on wearing the dress too... now I have to find a dress last minute...
2.0,This sweater wasn't what I expected the quality in all honesty could be better for the price. I ordered a medium but the tag on the sweater says XL so the sizes are way off. The zipper is plastic and looks like it can break easily. It also smelled funny so it would definitely need to be washed before wearing but it has no care instructions as far as how it should be washed and if it can be dried like most clothes do. It was purchased as a gift and the reaction will determine if I return it or not.
2.0,Could have possibly worn it had it not been for the sleeves. They cut off my blood circulation they were so tight. If you buy anything from Allegra K make sure you are tiny. It's just not going to work with someone who acually has meat on their bones.
2.0,Very disappointed in the color. Doesn‚Äôt look at all like your picture it is very dark almost looks black. Can‚Äôt return because need it right away for a gift.
2.0,"comformable but to hot to wear under mask, sticks to face"
2.0,"I've done a lot of miles with UD flasks, but had yet to try the straw tops. In the end, I'm going back to the standard bottles. I don't like how the straw flops around out of the top of the holster, and the added fluidic drag through the straw means water is not as free flowing as standard bottles. The added convenience of having the straw more accessible than the nozzle of the regular flask was not significant to me.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that that they changed the size of the opening so that my other tops are not compatible with these bottles. Dropping from 3.5 stars to 2 because of that.<br /><br />If you really like the convenience of the straw, don't mind the reduced flow, and don't need to be backwards compatible with existing ""regular"" flasks, then these will probably work for you. Not for me, though."
2.0,Cups are awkward and material is itchy!
2.0,They say elbow length they only come to the wrist
2.0,Works okay but way too heavy on the face and falls off when bending down.
2.0,Symbol is small and I don‚Äôt really like the clasp on the back. Not great quality
2.0,"I expected the stripes on this shirt to be part of a pattern, like a tie-die, but they are actually screen printed on. Returned the shirt."
2.0,Shirt was too small. I‚Äôm a medium in size and I ordered a large thinking it was gonna fit a little loose...NOPE!! It is a small in the US and large in CHINA! And I received it torn. Was not very happy with this!
2.0,"This shirt shows everything. It looked great on the shoulders but from the boobs down not so much. It highlighted Every bump, love handle, belly button, ab. Not attractive"
2.0,"i had problems with this dress.. it was heavy, the material was rough and scratchy, and the neck line was very constricting and irritating my skin.<br />i had to return"
2.0,"I love the look of these. The fabric isn‚Äôt too thin or too thick. The print is cute and the printing itself is well done.<br /><br />Issue is I have washed them twice and they‚Äôre falling apart.<br /><br />One arm had a rip in the top of the shoulder. The other arm has a rip in the armpit, and the cuff of the sleeve is unraveling.<br /><br />They weren‚Äôt that cheap to say no big deal. That‚Äôs just too much damage for two washes, and that‚Äôs on cold and delicate with baby detergent."
2.0,"The lace trim only went up about midway between cleavage and strap, not fully up to the strap like the picture. If you have a larger chest it won‚Äôt fit loosely, and if you get a larger size to make it fit looser, the sides under your armpits will do that saggy thing that makes your bra show on the sides and then the shirt doesn‚Äôt look cute.<br /><br />Also, it fits and looks like one of the kind of reject shirts from Ross or TJ maxx that make you go ‚Äúthis is why this is on clearance AT Ross.‚Äù...you know what I mean."
2.0,"wish that it wasnt so poorly made.. the belt has clue all over it... if it was made better, it would have been perfect..."
2.0,Transparent material
2.0,"This is very lightweight and cute overall, but the bust and shoulder area is too tight."
2.0,This stocking is supposed to be 20-30 mlHg in strength.  It is not! Beware what you believe!
2.0,"Super cute and comfy, and I love the button detail, but sheds LOTS of fuzz!  I highly caution against wearing with a black shirt. :) It seriously looked like fur balls were all over my shirt."
2.0,Material so thin that the color white shirt is see- through. I would pick a different color.
2.0,The idea of the outfit is cute but the fabric is cheap and makes a rustling sound
2.0,The pendant is beautiful. It says it is oxidized but the wings tarnish every time it has been worn. While gently cleaning the tarnish a piece the connects the wing broke. Can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs still in place but expected better quality all around. I also purchased 2 of the ball chains and they both broke at the clasp and would need a jewelry to reattach. Company only assisted with one of the chains so I am stuck with a useless chain I paid for.
2.0,"Many issues with this helmet. First the visor is very flimsy and was cracked and broken in multiple places on arrival.<br /><br />Second, the left rear side is warped inward so the helmet has a substantial dent in it.<br /><br />Third, the helmet is advertised as adult male size, however the actual size is smaller than my suns two piece Jango Fett helmet. It is definitely too small for me.<br /><br />It is sturdy hard PVC which is nice and the paint job does match the tv show.<br /><br />Probably will wind returning it due to damage and size."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:42ca371ff7a2d1a8c18e8e6c22d55b5e]] Recibi este reloj con la segundera da√±ada, es decir, no se le ven en la pantalla, pareciera algo insignificante pero mi temor es que se me vaya borrando las horas y minutos en los pr√≥ximos d√≠as."
2.0,Disappointed- extremely small
2.0,These were huge for my 9 year old. Way too big for kid
2.0,This dress looks super cute.....in the picture. I ordered a medium and it barely goes to my ankles. I'll about 5'7. The material reminds me of an umbrella. To be clear I ordered the dress with the stripes going in different directions. I post a picture of the one I bought. I'll be returning it.
2.0,"Wanted to love this suit.  I love the colors, the fit.  But there is one big problem that can‚Äôt be overlooked.  The seams don‚Äôt sit flat.  So the white inside lining rolls out and are completely visible, especially on the bum.  So basically you have to walk around with the white inside lining peeking out.  That alone makes it unusable. It looks like a diaper is peeking out from under your suit. It only happens on the bum."
2.0,Super cute! but very itchy
2.0,"For whatever reason, they decided to make the two pieces with the blue fabric on the shirt instead of doing a shirt and jumper and the result nearly guarantees a significant amount to alterations if you want it to look like Dorothy. Really disappointed."
2.0,I really dislike leaving bad reviews but this looks awful. There are globs of hot glue stuck everywhere and the gold beads were falling off straight out of the bag.  I can't believe I paid nearly $17 for this.  Its going back I'm afraid. It was shipped quickly though and might be wearable if it weren't for all the glue.
2.0,Sized for a child.
2.0,Bought for my RV.  Made of styrofoam. Does not appear to be very durable. Sent is back.
2.0,Lovely panties...but pantyliners won't stick to material.  Just not going to work for me......
2.0,"Poor quality, too big"
2.0,Product runs very small. Not true to size. Was 2 sizes too small.
2.0,These shoes stopped working after 1 day. They lit up but lights went out when my daughter walked on them.
2.0,It broke after 1 week
2.0,"It seems as if they are low rise, which is strange for exercise pants."
2.0,"It's most likely a very warm hat, tho very small, circumference and 'depth' of hat."
2.0,"Did not like this. The stitching is different than expected from the photo, and the seams seem barely held together by a piece of string. It also feels very synthetic, almost plastic like, and I feel like if the pilling won‚Äôt get the sweater, the seams will just come undone within a couple months of purchase. Not worth the price, I‚Äôd rather buy this on wish.com for five dollars. Don‚Äôt love it. Sending it back."
2.0,Returned didn‚Äôt like
2.0,Cute dress but runs very small. Returning.
2.0,Wife didn't  like  them
2.0,The glasses are a great color of read and the case is nice that's all that is good about the glasses. My grandson is 5 year old and the glasses are huge on him. The lens are almost adult size and the frames are very wide. I would not recommend to purchase them.
2.0,Shoes were way too small and return shipping costs were high. I have bought several pairs of these in the past and they just aren't made as well any longer.
2.0,"Measurements directly below breast is 33.5, measurement directly across breast is 39. I wear Wacoal bras and always wear a 36D. I ordered a 36D and trust me it is a 34A. Quality seems to good, but sizing way off. Gave it to a friend."
2.0,Was a lot smaller than it should have been
2.0,"I like the length and the additional padding sewn into the palm of the gloves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these gloves are way too thin to do any work around rose bushes. My forearms got stuck as the (faux?) suede did nothing to prevent thorns from poking through. And the leather around the hands were also too thin as a couple of really thin/spiny thorns stuck me a couple of times too!.<br /><br />These might be decent for working with fruits/veggies in a garden bed but for handling any plants or bushes that have thorns -- you need thick leather gloves!<br /><br />These are not it!"
2.0,I didn't care for this skirt. It was so big. Wasn't flattering at all.
2.0,"I returned it, not a good quality magerial."
2.0,"For a little baggy.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 150 LB, and the Medium is too loose"
2.0,I bought these for a 12 yr old boy because it states that it's for men. The mask were extremely too small for a young boy.
2.0,They seem much longer than a 6&#34; inseam and the ends of the legs are very tight.
2.0,The zipper on the dress was poorly made. Every time I would zip it up or down it felt like the zipper was going to break. I would have to literally zip it real slowly. Also the jewels on the dress where flimsy and falling off. The strings from the jewels where sticking out. Very disappointed. Planning on returning it.
2.0,Didn‚Äôt really give me the support I needed. I‚Äôm 40c and everything was on the tightest hooks and I ordered xl
2.0,Only complaint is the material! Cheap soccer jersey fabric :/
2.0,"No stress to check at all.  That can mean more cotton less elastic but elastic is important in Sox.  Fit , comfort are priority but more cotton means breathability and foot health. My feet are great with elastic though and I would not buy these again.  No stretch at all."
2.0,"The cost may seem attractive, but make sure to scroll way down in the Amazon product profile to find out the base is not included.  Tack on $140 more."
2.0,"Very uncomfortable fit. Not dipected as shown on webite. Symbols are different, Disappointed.  But still an intersting ring none the less."
2.0,"The photo isn't visible without a camera,  and it came later than expected.  Not exactly what I thought.  My recipients don't wear them."
2.0,way to small i think they sent teen size
2.0,"My husband was not happy! The hat arrived in an envelope!! and the cap was flat. So, since it was flattened, it lost its form and does not fit well. You would think it would be in a box, I cant imagine why they would ship it in an envelope with no, fragile or do not crush labels on it....."
2.0,This dress was so cute. I wanted it to work so badly but the white is totally see through. Definitely size up! Ordered XL and it fit perfectly.
2.0,Lleg√≥ m√°s peque√±o
2.0,Got what I paid for. It is quite large and looks and feels very cheap.
2.0,"I ordered an xxl because I'm usually an xl and the reviews said this runs small.  Tiny would be more accurate.  The straps didn't even cover my chest up.  However, the skirt is very pretty."
2.0,Nothing like the picture to dark and dirty...what a shame they look really pretty on the pic...
2.0,I loved the look of this purse so I was so disapointed when the strap started fraying and the logo lettering started coming off letter by letter. It looked ghetto after 2 months. I'm so sad about the lack of quality.
2.0,Not the same color as picture
2.0,I could not get the hold to fit into the slot for the fitbit.
2.0,"Cute, but 3/6 chains broke apart while trying to put them on my girls. After 2 days of wearing this product the chain began to change color. Not worth it."
2.0,"product is small for a 10-13, snug on feet and cutting off circulation in calf."
2.0,Image is perfect looks great.  Material is solid not mesh like.  Less breathable.
2.0,Ties too short for my size
2.0,"The ""chain"" does not stay cinched, the pentacle is too heavy."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this, but I didn‚Äôt like the sheen on the fabric, the arms were a little tight.  The back didn‚Äôt lay right because there is not back slit so it puffs up in the back.  The return process was easy."
2.0,"Have prescription glasses with UV blocking coating, but wanted blockers without a prescription to wear with my contacts when working and purchased this two pack. I have tried using them for several days, but they do not perform to my liking or like my $$$ prescription glasses‚Äîmakes me feel like I‚Äôm in a fun house."
2.0,Only wore a few times material tore in crotch area now scared to wear them
2.0,"Love the bracelet, just the magnet will not stay closed.  The bracelet fell off at least 10 times in 2 hours and I just took it off afraid to lose it.<br />I have a black one that did not do this it stay closed.  Not sure what to do now as I am afraid to wear it."
2.0,Loved it the first time I wore it but washed it once (hung to dry) and the length shrunk so now it's not very cute anymore.
2.0,"One of the wheels began failing, meaning they would not remain outside of the skate, so when my daughter step on them, the wheel will slip inside, I had to open the compartment to fix this, and they seem to work fine now."
2.0,Shirt is irregular
2.0,"The edges are soft and limp. Semi-rigid borders along all sides would go a long way to making a product such as this much more practical. We have another set with the more-rigid edges, and I would gladly have paid 2 times more to get that same feature if buying again."
2.0,real stiff not soft stretchy cotton.
2.0,Very thick hard to breath also run small. Very disappointed wish I had read the comments from others first.
2.0,Rather disappointed.  The shoulder to waist is short and I am not long waisted. The belt sits just under the bust not at the waist.  The forearms are tight.  The back ground color is teal not blue as in pictures.
2.0,There is a curve in the lens that makes me have to tip my head a certain way in order to see out of these - disappointed though they do look nice!
2.0,The material was nice but it had pockets and that was a huge ewww for me! They were also too long which I‚Äôd have to get hemmed and I didn‚Äôt want to spend anymore money than what I already have
2.0,I bought these pins for my friends birthday. But when I received it I noticed that the mockingjay pin was bent and that the bee pin clip was very loose and I'm not sure if it will stay on very well. Other than that awesome pins great detail.
2.0,I dislike them because some of them have holes in them and they are not tight enough on my arm
2.0,Nice jacket but runs really small. Bought for my grandson he is a small in men. I should of ordered a large.
2.0,"There is very little room to put anything other than a regular sized wallet in it. If you put anything in the side pockets, it makes it hard to zip, close or try to add anything to the other compartments because it get crammed easily with very little in it."
2.0,Way too small. Good for organizing but too small for a diaper organizer
2.0,They're cute but I couldn't stand the smell.
2.0,"I usually take a small or even an extra small in some rare instances. I ordered this shirt in a small but the material does not give at all. I don't want to be bothered with returning it, so I will keep it and see if I lose a few pounds so it will fit. :-)"
2.0,"I LOVE the style of these glasses. I've been buying them again every time they break, with one replacement from the seller in May due to it shipped dead on arrival. Always breaks the same way, the arm breaks off. I never fold them, always put them on carefully and they will pop off my head while I'm wearing them. It's such a shame too, the shipping is fast and they are the only style I've found to be able to wear indoors and out. Giving 2 stars because the seller's shipping is good, they attempted to replace one pair, and the problem is just the product."
2.0,"The quality seemed to be fine and I liked the colors I received, but the socks were not crew socks as I understand the term.  They barely covered my ankle bone.  Another three inches or so of ankle height and I might have given them a few more stars.  I returned them because I don't like shorty socks and the description failed to mention this."
2.0,Kind of small not the size its just a small ring better for a lady
2.0,Really don't like the color leeching.
2.0,True to size. Very strong nasty chemical smell. Weird cut at neckline/bodice... pleats do not match... sewing error?. Don‚Äôt think I will be wearing this or buying any more from them
2.0,"Here's something that various potential buyers might find interesting. There are various sellers here on Amazon who sell &#34;this very same&#34; product, using the same product pictures as this seller. See, for example: [[ASIN:B01I880V0O Pink Queen Women's Elegant V Neck Long Loose Belted Rompers Jumpsuits Black Large]]; [[ASIN:B01K1TXPYM Dlgjpa Women's Rompers Jumpsuits Long Wide Leg Dressy Sleeves One piece Jumpsuits Pants black Medium]]; [[ASIN:B01E5CTW7A HOTAPEI Women V Neck Belted Sleeveless Wide Leg Jumpsuit Medium Black]]<br />However, they are *not* the same products. I wanted to order different sizes (M and L) because I wasn't sure which size would fit best. But the seller I was looking at only had one of the sizes available. So I ordered the other one from a different seller. I was astonished when I received the clothing and realized the two pieces were not even made of the same material. I got curious and so ordered the &#34;same&#34; item from yet another seller, hoping it would fit better. And, again, I received an item that was different in material, cut, and sizing. I am not sure what exactly is going on here but these sellers definitely shouldn't all be using the same product pictures if they are shipping off completely different items to customers.<br /><br />In case it is helpful to anyone, the product that this seller shipped to me runs small and is made of very stretchy gym-clothing type material. The Pink Queen version of this romper seems true to size and is made of a less stretchy, better quality material. The HOTAPEI version of the romper was made of a type of chiffon-ish material and was true to size but the cut was weird under the armpits; the fabric sort of stuck out and away from my body."
2.0,What the heck is up with the sizing! On my third order trying to figure out something that works. Read about new improved design with higher waist but it is overboard for my body type and goes to under my bra :/. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 140 with an athletic slender build.
2.0,"Mi hermana es S por error lo ped√≠ en XL, el mismo d√≠a solicit√© me cambiaran de talla y no me hicieron caso, y cuatro d√≠a despu√©s luego de hacer el env√≠o, me responden que ya no pod√≠an . P√©sima atenci√≥n , no quer√≠a devolver solo quer√≠a cambio de talla. Esta bien si no fuera por la talla"
2.0,Could have came in a better package didn't like the idea that it was in a bag and the product doesn't fit very well for the size
2.0,"I am not sure whether this was too small or too large, because it's both at the same time.  It's a weird cut that is short and wide.  The neckline sits up in a strange way, and I don't think the overall fit was very flattering either.  Which is too bad, because I though the print was cute."
2.0,It fell apart in days of receiving it. I gave it 2 stars only because fast delivery.
2.0,I went a size up and they still didn't fit. Pants are cut super small. To short at the legs so if you tall these pants are NOT for you. Super cute but not made for big girls.
2.0,Looked great broke super easy. Lasted 2 wears.
2.0,Definitely needs lining. Too sheer and runs large
2.0,I have a long torso. I bought a large and it's to small. I lift my arms and I don't like people seeing my waist. I'm average weight. The fabric is soft on the inside though
2.0,These were too sparkly and looked fake and cheap. Returned them.
2.0,I am not a large person at all and this outfit made me feel like godzilla broke loose. The shorts were just dumb looking they ride up and have a waistband like bad old 70's shorts. The top though is just something else.....the straps were literally not even sewn into the items and had like a thread to hold them on. The outfit looks like it cost 2 dollars to make. It was uncomfortable also. The plus my husband sure liked it because the shorts ride up so high.....lmao I need things to be cute but practical. Not riding up into the magic lands.
2.0,"We are UGA fans, got the glasses.. Very cheap, Cleaning the lens and it popped out. Took a few mins to get back in . My 8 yr old boy wears them but he said they are a little tight.  We are just going keep as shelf material. Not for adults.  Go Dawgs!"
2.0,Ped√≠ mi talla y result√≥ ser muy peque√±o
2.0,"They are very narrow - hurt my head and had to give them to a friend. Otherwise, great looking for price."
2.0,Very pretty and light fabric but came late and was stained.  Disappointed üòû
2.0,Very thin cotton material.  I normally fit into large pull over shirts comfortably.  Material is much thinner than I had expected.  For me it's overpriced compared to Henley shirt that I purchased at Costco for $5 less.  I would not really recommend this product.
2.0,The 36 is more like a 34 :/ disappointed no time to return them before work party.
2.0,"It‚Äôs definitely not what I expected, the quality of the graphic on front of the top is low grade and the size runs smaller than sited in the details. Not happy with this purchase."
2.0,"I ordered an XXL and was shocked at how small it was.  In reality it was, at best, your typical L size.<br /><br />Material is thin but not surprising considering the cheap price."
2.0,"The very best quality, but I wear a 12EE shoe and I didn't have the strength to get the socks past my toes.  I had to look several times to be sure that I got the large size.  I did.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Myles R.Omel<br /><br />&#60;omel.myles7@gmail.com."
2.0,"I was disappointed in this product.  The item shipped was neither the model that I selected nor was the finish on the medal what was specified. That being said, I thought the website for the product was informative and attractive.  I may try again to purchase a medal for a friend."
2.0,"This product arrived dirty- there was a weird globby yellow stain on the collar.  Although the print is very pretty, the sizing is inconsistent.  The top was huge and the pants smaller than expected. The material is very silly, but thin and staticky."
2.0,It would look better as an Aline and loose the elastic waistline
2.0,I'm probably going to return this.  I don't like the material it's made of slippery and fake feeling
2.0,"Did not expect it to be knit, thought it's<br />100% cotton voile."
2.0,After a couple washes the fabric gets weird and fades pretty fast.
2.0,"I wear a lot of  wedge type sandals so I had high hopes here but these shoes are dangerously tippy.  I don't know if it is the shape of the sole which may be narrower in just the wrong places or the material they are made of.  I nearly twisted an ankle twice on the first day.  I will not put them on again, it is not worth it."
2.0,"Not leather, at least not the one I received. Well, for the price, it's definitely will constructed."
2.0,i was not happy with these.  for one they are REALLY thin.  two they do not stay up at all. and three the white and gray look almost the same cuz the color is not true to photo i would not recommend unless u want really thin thigh highs and lighter in color than the photos
2.0,Came all gift boxed up and pretty...just wish they fit. So annoyed because the length is perfect for my 5'2&#34; height but was way too baggy in all the wrong places. Maybe because Im super skinny but they just didnt look sexy on me. Maybe someone else it would look amazing. Plus the shine was alot shinier in person than the pics.
2.0,The color is not as vibrant as pictured in the purple floral
2.0,"nice hat, but it doesnt fit me so i gave it to my husband.  the bill is miles too long, too."
2.0,Its very pretty but its to short especially if you have hips & a big behind!!
2.0,"Clips don‚Äôt fasten. There is a large gap in the plastic clip, making it easy for mask strings to fall out of clips, defeating the purpose of the lanyard. Does tighten nicely in the back."
2.0,kinda ugly.
2.0,"Pretty, but didn't quite work for me clasp kept coming a loose, but ironically didn't fall off bracelet will fall off"
2.0,"THEY FABRIC IS FABULOUS AND THE WEIGHT IS PERFECT.  THE ONLY THING IS I WAS EXPECTING WHITE AND IT IS A WHEAT COLOR.  WITH GRAY HAIR AND OLIVE SKIN, IT JUST DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME.  I REALLY NEED WHITE!! I WILL FIND SOMEONE TO PASS IT ON TO."
2.0,"I'm 5'6"" and the shorts ended half-way down my lower legs.  Shorts are designed for very tall men.  I gave them to my buddy who is 6'5' and they fit him fine."
2.0,I dont like too much look diferents than the picture
2.0,It is made for little girls. It does not cover the whole bust.
2.0,Non slip is good on oil but not too good on surfaces with water. Not very water resistant. Seam at the sole and shoe is cracking. I think it‚Äôs going to separate in 6 to 8 months. I‚Äôve had them for 1 month
2.0,"The worst part about these is the quality. I wore them for an hour workout and they already show signs of fading and pilling in the knees. But they look great on and are very soft and feel nice. The length is also too long, which is another drawback. I wanted to love these but Unfortunately these are going back."
2.0,"The front of the dress is absolutely gorgeous, but the corseted back with no hook or button closure for the insert just detracts from it. Plus YOU NEED someone to help you get in this dress. Too cumbersome. But the dress really is a beautiful dress overall"
2.0,Ordered the white pair and they came in an ugly burn orange color. They are soft and comfortable but did not want this color
2.0,"I like the style, but when I wore them to play golf, within a few minutes in the heat, my forehead turned black above my nose.  Either sweat or sunscreen, not sure what made that happen."
2.0,The colors are very different than what I expected.
2.0,"I returned this, it was super cute but runs really small."
2.0,"Too tiny, for a child, not  for an a adult , very disappointed.."
2.0,The strap can not be adjusted so the case of your watch and the buckle of the band are centered on opposite sides of your wrist.
2.0,"They look nice on the picture but in real life they look pretty cheap, probably they are made of plastic. The closure didn‚Äôt work for both pairs so I had to fix it, the problem is that if you constantly use them it doesn‚Äôt work again so I would not recommend to buy these earrings."
2.0,This shirt is too small around the shoulders.
2.0,"HUGE ! I dont think it matters what size you order , the fingers are gigantic and not shaped like real fingers. So you will need to alter this glove"
2.0,"Txwo of these chains broke within two days, very dusappointed in them"
2.0,"I was so disappointed, the top for perfectly but the bottoms ran small"
2.0,The gloves smell so bad!! Reminds me of the time I visited a farm for a school trip!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!
2.0,"Not strong enough ,But it was worth the money !!!"
2.0,Poor Quality tore when i put it on.
2.0,This is NOT a wide brim hat.  This is a short floppy hat similar to the wool-like ones for fall and winter.  Picture is very deceiving.  It just doesn't cover the face completely and causes unwanted sun exposure.  Will return.
2.0,"Not true to size and not very good quality, had to return :("
2.0,Material is cheap and gets torn
2.0,Too much for a pair. Not as secure as I expected.
2.0,"Nice looking, nice enough quality for a pair of Dockers jeans pants but I bought it to replace a 30-year old work.  The leather looked thick like the belt I was replacing buy it has stretched at least six inches since first putting it on.<br /><br />Buy it for looks, not for work."
2.0,The quality of this shirt is poor.
2.0,"I'm afraid they did not work for my boyfriend. He has the type of colorblindness that these are made for but his case must be too severe. The directions say to keep trying to wear them for up to two weeks for your eyes to adjust but after just a few minutes, he got a headache and was nauseous. He kept them on for another half hour but didn't see any difference other than what he always sees when he has on sunglasses. No red or green, purple or orange. They did arrive in good condition and promptly. Just wanted others to be warned not to get your hopes up too much."
2.0,"This is a pretty little anklet, but it caught and broke within a few times of wearing it. It would be easy enough to fix with some little pliers, but I haven't taken the time to do so. It looks like nice metal, and the little turquoise piece is pretty."
2.0,It‚Äôs cute but I had it for maybe a week and a half and the flower gem part detached from the earring when I was adjusting it so the flower wasn‚Äôt all the way behind my ear.
2.0,"I generally wear a size large. Even though this jacket came as a size large, it was too small for me. I could barely put it on and zip up. Furthermore, it is just a single layer of fabric so it is meant for early fall/late spring when it is crisp but not very cold outside. I am also not a fan of the style -- maybe just a personal taste. Order a size up for those interested but I would have passed on this."
2.0,"Bought these as fun shirts for my daughter and I as we love Hallmark Christmas movie time!  The fit was smaller/tighter than expected and the material is so so. Thin, slightly itchy. Not horrible, but not great.  They are a fun thought, but I would not buy them again."
2.0,Strange fit and ended up returning. there are better options on amazon to put your money towards
2.0,I like the bands very much and they arrived quicky. The set included tools and pens. The only disappointment was there was 2 pink bands and no orange one. I had wanted the orange particulary.
2.0,So this product is actually beautiful but the sizing is way off. The largest size available barely fit my 92 pound preteen.
2.0,Returned item.  It was too small
2.0,The worse quality I bought on Amazon. The robber stickers cracked and peel even before the first wash. Colors are not as vibrant as on the picture. Fabric is a solid color with stickers that don't stick - it is not normal fabric knit. Carter would never make anything like this. Overpriced junk.
2.0,Very very very cheap made. I bought two pairs for each of my daughters. The straps broke on both pair after only wearing them a couple times. I sent them back to be replaced and the replacements also broke even though my daughters didnt using the straps on the replacement. The company will not replace again but my girls don‚Äôt want to give them up for a refund so they are stuck with broken brand new boots. They‚Äôre definitely not worth the buy.
2.0,Size too small for adults
2.0,"I love the product, super soft but not true to size, too small for the size listed. The hood tie/strings look cheap or just had long shoe strings put in by manufacturer."
2.0,Stopped working after a week
2.0,"My old ones were made in El Salvador, latest ones I just got are made in Mexico. The fabric in incredibly stiff even after multiple washings.<br />It's just so different from the olds ones I have. Very disappointing."
2.0,very loose on the pandora chain.
2.0,"Big bag, shoulder straps are cheap."
2.0,So tiny I gave it to my 4 year old granddaughter
2.0,"They were great for the first month,  then they developed a squeaking noise. Very annoying when walking on carpet. Tried using powders. Nothing worked. Threw them out."
2.0,No pouch here....pretty much a flat front to it....was not happy with it on arrival and sent straight back!
2.0,Size is ok but the shirt fabric is for one time usage.
2.0,Not comfortable at all even with insoles. Don't go on walks with them;)
2.0,"Fast shipping, the necklace looks nice, but it is poorly crafted! Tried the necklace on and one of the pieces came off, luckily I was able to fix it.(One of the wires that holds the necklace together fell off! I was able to fix it myself, I ended up tighten and checking all the wires! So hopefully I can get a couple of wears out of it, and it won't be a complete lost!)"
2.0,Yeah this is size really small. I had to return it. If you are a small cup size it might work for you but go up a size
2.0,"The received item is way darker than the pictures, you cannot distinguish the hour."
2.0,"I wear a 10.5, ordered the 11 (45EU) and it was easily an inch too long.  Unwearable, returned, smaller sizes weren't available so ended up buying a different brand/kind."
2.0,Stopped working after 2 days of use.
2.0,Not a good fit for shorter women and arrived wrinkled
2.0,Very cute for the price but unfortunately fell apart after two weeks of owning them. For that reason I would not recommend.
2.0,"I just couldn‚Äôt make them fit, they are way to heavy to stay put"
2.0,Good news- the ear rings are very cute. Bad news- the stone fell out shortly after I bought them. Boo!:-(
2.0,I ordered this screen and was fairly simple to replace. I started playing a game and noticed that the colors started to fade then the scan lines started taking over the screen. I contacted the seller and was shipped a replacement within three days. The replacement wasn‚Äôt better. It arrived with a broken ribbon cable and the ds wouldn‚Äôt boot up
2.0,This is not a booty for fall/winter use in the Midwestern USA.
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the colors of these socks. I bought the Ghibli set, which are all really cute in the picture. The coloring on the socks I received is more like weird zombie versions, and far less cute. The girl on the broom and spirited away socks colors are reasonable enough (although the colors still don't match the product picture), but Totoro's stomach is atomic blue, as is the skin of the children on the totoro socks. The people in the howl's moving castle socks are also blue, unlike in the picture presented. Would not recommend, unless you like ghibli-zombie hybrids."
2.0,"Before the COVID-19 crisis, I used to buy 3.5 magnification reading glasses for $1.00 each at a discount store. Worked well and lasted 6-8 months on average. With the COVID-19 crisis, I am shopping on line. These glasses were worse than the 1.00 glasses. Blurry and ill focussed. They now reside in the garbage can."
2.0,No me llego el color rosa que pedi me enviaron en color blanco la cadena de leder demasiado grandes el cierre no entra el dije
2.0,"I like the material, and the pockets. I just wish it didn't go nearly 7&#34; past my feet. It's unfortunately unwearable. I'm 5'2&#34;, if you're tall it might work for you."
2.0,I like the color and fabric of dress but it is far too small
2.0,Product was way to small for a large. I gave it to my step daughter for christmas. She's 9yrs old!
2.0,The shirt was a little too short. My baby doesn‚Äôt need to be wearing a crop top.<br /><br />And the little decorative puff balls fall off easily
2.0,"This bracelet was disappointing. Very cute on the surface but it does not stay tied no matter what I do or how tight I tie it. A better quality string or a different way of securing it would‚Äôve been nice. Too bad because nice design but after a month, I can‚Äôt wear it anymore."
2.0,Buckle pin broke
2.0,First of all this shirt runs VERY small.  I usually wear a L or XL.  I bought this in a XXL due to the reviews of other buyers.  It fit perfect.  The problem is that you have to have a neck like a linebacker for this shirt to fit anything to close to a turtleneck.  For that reason I returned it.  I was very disappointed.
2.0,The strap broke the day I wore it. The product is cheaply made.
2.0,They fit good. Not tight but are see-through. I wouldn‚Äôt wear in public unless I wear a long shirt. Expected them to be a little thicker. Oh well.
2.0,I just received the sunglasses and when I put them on I noticed they had a bend in them> They sat on my nose slightly crooked which is annoying. I'd tried to bend them to correct this but was afraid to break them.<br />I'd like to return these and order another pair that are in perfect condition
2.0,"kind of dull and is made of cheap materials. but hey, you get what you pay for. Maybe I might get 5 wears out of this."
2.0,Decent quality for the price but not as expected with advertised price. It was a gift and by the time we figured that out it was too late to return. Very disappointed.
2.0,"It is pretty but arrive broken, i had to put some glue on it."
2.0,Terrible construction. There are loose threads all over the elastic. The elastic is cheap plastic and bunched up in places. I wore it today and hope it survives being wanted because it's cute!
2.0,These don't really feel like compression socks at all. The only place they're tight is at the top.
2.0,"Too small, poorly made and impossible to get in or out of easily.  Horrible craftsmanship."
2.0,The sizing on this product is off. I was very disappointed. This is the 3rd time I have tried to purchase clothing from Amazon and each time the sizing has been wrong. Doubtful that I‚Äôll ever try to purchase clothing again.
2.0,Small and cheap material.
2.0,"Disappointed. Fit, not good. And it says, ""Outfly"" across the front! What is that supposed to mean?! Stupid. ""Outfly""?!  That doesn't even refer to ANYTHING! I'm not about to wear something with stupid writing on it. It has absolutely nothing to do with fly fishing, so what does it mean?! Sent back."
2.0,The V line on the neck was poorly made it did not fall in the middle of my chest it went towards one side of my chest
2.0,"This was too short, even for a summer dress; and it gapped in the Burton‚Äôs.  Had to return."
2.0,"I read the review from 10/2021 and thought,  maybe they just had bad luck.  Well, be forewarned, there is a terrible smell.  It is NOT a mild smell.  I soaked this apron for a total of 1¬Ωhrs in OxiClean and washed it twice before the smell dissipated.  I don't know if the smell will come back when it gets wet again, but I have run out of time to exchange it for something else."
2.0,"I am allergic to the sun. I get awful painful bumps on my arms. The price is good for 2 pairs, material is really good, unfortunately they don't stay up. I tried to hot glue the tops I saw a hack on FB. It works better but not the best. Ill probably modify them , just wish they stayed up"
2.0,Earrings were bent upon arrival and distorted so I couldn‚Äôt bend them back.
2.0,very stiff purse and the inside is very noisy material
2.0,This is not a true Baggallini.  It is a knockoff.  I should have known better.
2.0,Cheap looking and not a good fit
2.0,These are capri pants!!!!! Not long or even ankle length.
2.0,"I ordered a size D-cup. I am a 36D normally and these just kind of hung on me and didn‚Äôt provide the support like I‚Äôm seeing on these other women. My breasts are bell-shaped so maybe that has something to do with it, too. I will say I love the pasties that came with this set. Just the regular bra did not work for me."
2.0,I'm about a 38 or 36 D...this was much too small for my chest
2.0,Very flimsy and bend easily
2.0,Greatly darkens the boot color.
2.0,"I sincerely wanted to love this sports bra.  Loved the color & fit when on (& I didn‚Äôt move), but any movement caused it to bust open‚Ä¶.seemed to be a zipper problem."
2.0,"My complaint isn't that there is anything at all wrong with these shirts, just that I didn't know until I received them that the material is ribbed, and has a somewhat shiny sheen to it.  I assumed based on the description that it was a more or less plain dress shirt.  Also, be very careful when ironing.  I forgot to set the heat down from the ""Cotton"" setting and melted a part of the shirt."
2.0,Got all other shirts the size he wears but this one was too long
2.0,Really disappointed in this outfit. It looks super cute on my daughter and fit well but the entire crotch of the overalls split down the middle before she has even worn it for a full day. I'll keep it because the shirt is still good quality but disappointed that the panda couldn't hold up to even a day's worth of toddler activity
2.0,rather cheap feeling for the price
2.0,"The shorts looked nice when they came in. When I tried to run in them, ny thighs started sweating like crazy. The friction is really bad. The shorts also retain sweat for ever. After running 1.5 miles, I couldn't take it and had to change to some of the old shorts I had before.<br />The built in pocket is so small and useless. Also the top layer keeps riding up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, It's too late to return it. Should have tried them when they were delivered."
2.0,"Cute but large.<br />I tried to wear it to work, but it kept falling into my eyes if when I leaned down. It would not stay secure over my nose.<br />Very annoying."
2.0,it looks like the picture but the ring is very cheep it is so thin i'an afraid to put it on it might bend would not buy it again. Michael
2.0,"Not as depicted in the photos. Not of good quality, somewhat see through and the colors are very purple compared to what is shown on the web page."
2.0,"Meh.  Ok, but not quite what I was looking for."
2.0,These are very flimsy and do not hold up to multiple washes.  They are a nice color and length but the straps are already breaking and the fabric is thinning from being washed which causes them to ride up when I am wearing them.  I've only had them a couple months.  I won't buy them again.
2.0,I only used like 2 out of this set. Some are ridiculously large. Ended up tarnishing after a few wears.
2.0,"Very pretty, but cheap material. Perhaps great for just taking photos in, but not practical for wearing more than a couple times... it will fall apart.:("
2.0,"Material muy duro, no se siente c√≥moda."
2.0,Difficult to put it on.
2.0,"I received my pants on time, however they were obviously worn before & returned with the tag on. The pocket of the pants has a used chapstick & baby girl pony tail bow."
2.0,Strange material. Very thin and see through in the chest area where it is tightest. Also too short comes to a few inches above ankles and I am 5'5.
2.0,Fabric was cheap and itchy tbh - didn‚Äôt fit well at all
2.0,"I received the outfit and it is super cute, loose fitting, not see through however i cannot get it past my thighs. Please size up in this outfit."
2.0,I‚Äôm highly disappointed in this order! I bought the same pants I always buy but this time got a two pack. The material is almost see through now and feels flimsy! I‚Äôve mever had a problem with your pants before and now I‚Äôm so disappointed!! Did they start getting cheaper material??
2.0,"Super small. Can barely tell what it is. I have yet to wear it, I tried, but I couldn't even tell I was.."
2.0,The clasp does not hold. Pops open at the most inconvenient time
2.0,Snap broke the first time i tried to put a buckle on
2.0,"Uncomfortable, not soft, toes too short"
2.0,"Very poor paint job on the red one, I ordered a blue one also and it came in great condition."
2.0,Way shorter and thinner than expected. So bummed this didn't work out.
2.0,I did not like the way the shirt looked in person. It was shiny and a strange material.
2.0,"I read the reviews and the consensus was order 2 sizes up.  My daughter is small so I ordered a large.  The coat that arrived was an XXL relabeled as a L.  It was huge on her and on Medium me as well.  Wish the size issue was not so difficult.  The coat itself was soft inside and out.  It was long, almost down to my knees.  The zippers stuck and it felt like they needed to be zipped carefully.  Seemed to be quite warm.  The drawstrings worked nicely to tighten around the waist and lower jacket.  There are buttons as well as front zipper so if the zipper fails it could still be buttoned."
2.0,Runs smaller than normal so order one or two sizes larger. Other than fit shirt looks good.
2.0,"The color is bright and the hoodie looks nice, but fabric is loosely woven and a noticeable amount of  fuzz balls appeared on the sleeves the first week."
2.0,"Way too small. Was an XXL and did not fit - I wear a Women's Size 18 pants. Also, the belt had a terrible chemical type of odor. That irritates my headaches and was unpleasant. It was returned."
2.0,Returned only because it looks frumpy on me.  A bit looser than expected.
2.0,Actually a blue color. The tie doesn‚Äôt really make sense and it bunches to look unflattering
2.0,Isnt long enough to cover your lower neck so you have exposed skin above t shirt collar.
2.0,Runs very small bought for my self had to give to my daughter who's 12 and it was a little tight for her as well
2.0,It's not bad for the price but the gold tone on the bee is a little too yellow for my taste.
2.0,The seam under the chest is too tight.  Way to small for an XXL size.  Had to send this back.
2.0,One slipper started falling apart at the seam almost immediately
2.0,I get more compression from my old navy tank & it's 5 years old
2.0,"I'm 5&#34;7 and weigh 190 I got an xl in these tanks, there is no compression at all, and the black one is longer then the other two, it's like they are different shirts all together. I am not happy with these."
2.0,These sock are way to thin. I might as well go barefoot.
2.0,"Didn't realize how small these were. Cute, but tiny."
2.0,Top is nice. Sizing wrong
2.0,Damn this dress is shorter than it looked on the model! It kept riding up on me too because material is weird. Need to return.
2.0,The cz is absurdly large.  It looks totally fake.
2.0,These are VERY small.
2.0,at one year they randomly snapped while they were on my face and the lens fell out. were great until that happened
2.0,"I used this for my FitBit Blaze, however the band is too snug for my wrist."
2.0,Wanted to like this sweater but had creased lines on front. Unable to tell if thread flaw or packaging either way disappointed because a cute top.
2.0,"Fabric was very heavy, almost denim weight. There were no fasteners, other than the belt and it is a wrap around. Had I kept it, it would have needed some snaps or velcro at the waist."
2.0,"I loved these earrings, BUT, after wearing them 3 times, the clasp simply broke off. Poor quality."
2.0,20g was too large for my 20g piercing. Was unable to push through.
2.0,"These were fun for our whole family and my boys (4 and 6) enjoyed them. We turned off the lights and played with them for about 10 minutes then went on a night time walk with these on all of our fingers. It was fun while they lasted. After about 20 minutes, they start to loose power. They are very cheaply made and the white is the only one that is really bright. They would be a great cheap party favor instead of a cheap throw away toy, at least these provide more entertainment while they work."
2.0,The shirt is not as pictured. Not even close. Walmart shirts are way better and inexpensive compared to this.
2.0,"The bag looks very pretty in the picture. I think the bottom is supported with a cardboard piece. I received the bag folded in half so the cardboard was bent already. I did not mind too much. However after less than a week of use the ""straw"" knitted pieces are coming apart everywhere. The bag is no longer usable. A canvas tote might have been a better pick for durability. Also the sequins snag your clothes. It is a desirable buy for it's cheap price, however it will only last one trip to the beach."
2.0,"So, I thought it was an OKAY product. The material is see through which nice for the summer and if you live alone. The two down side of the product for me was that it wrinkled sooooo much. It super annoying. I slept with it and the straps kept stretching by the time it was morning it was super loose. Another thing an dthis is the last one.. When looking for the tag to see how it washes, it was in another language.  No direction so you are pretty hard guessing how to take care of the item on your own. It wasn't worth the money. It's not horrible but it ain't great."
2.0,Fades quickly.
2.0,"I really like this charm very pretty, but the stone fell out so I‚Äôll probably have to return it!"
2.0,"Lasted a whole year and then broke the second I opened it in the wind.  The year that it lasted is the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars and not one.  If you live in an area where it's windy a lot, get something more sturdy."
2.0,I only gave 2 stars because I still think it's a cute top. But the quality is poor and it runs small.
2.0,These would not fit snug to my face and the straps where you loosen and tighten would not stay attached it became really inconvenient and annoying.
2.0,"Im 5‚Äù flat and around 100 lb and I ordered a size 0. It was too long and the waist was wide, which made my crutch area looked unflattering."
2.0,doesn‚Äôt look like the one in the photo !  7 gray beads
2.0,The sleeves are way too tight. For the extra larger size I ordered it should be obvious that I am a larger woman So my arms are also larger. So disappointed.
2.0,I absolutely loved this dress when it came in however the one time I wore it all of the lacing came apart at the seam line on the front of the dress.
2.0,ankles are way too small.
2.0,Expected high waisted. Falls short on the backside which makes it roll down when bending over or squatting. Material is high quality and pattern is very pretty. Fit just didn't fit my body. Going back
2.0,"Compression was great, but the silicone bumps at the top ached after a few hours‚Äî plus, the overspill of top thigh made my thighs rub together- when they normally don‚Äôt. I sent them back."
2.0,"The t-shirts arrived in different sizes, although they all have M tags, where only one of them fits me. On top of that, the t-shirts run very short in length."
2.0,The package was left in the snow during a big storm.  It was buried except for a small corner we saw when looking for a pkg.  It was soaking wet and is now hanging up to dry.
2.0,Cute dress but fits pretty big the bottom is heavy
2.0,Cute but too small. The photos are deceiving. I would have sent it back but I didn‚Äôt want the hassle so I carry my things to work in it...just temporarily until I purchase a bigger tote. The straps are also short.
2.0,"Love the color, material, and how the top part of the dress fit. Hated literally everything else! I‚Äôm a solid size 6. I ordered this dress in a Large because I wanted it to be a little loose and casual. It was anything but loose! Also, I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô5‚Äù and this dress was SHORT! I‚Äôm super bummed because I could never wear this thing to work."
2.0,This sweater is not a normal length sweater as portrayed.  It fits more like a crop top.
2.0,ordered two pair.  one pair broken not repairable.
2.0,Had to return these as the thick part of the ring would swing down and stick out of my nose. I wasnt sure what was supposed to hang out it looked awkward.
2.0,Nothing like the online picture
2.0,"La tela se siente un poco bien aun que no es gruesa, si calienta. Solo el sueter azul presents algunas manchas en la parte de atras."
2.0,Rubber band like very loose and flimsy
2.0,"It was not the belt I was expecting. It has metal rings attaching the leather (about 4 or 5) and made it difficult to get the belt through the loops of my pants. Not to mention, I thought it would be all leather with metal studs. Its a nice belt, but not what I was looking for. Definitely sturdy."
2.0,Fabric is coarse and looks far too much like concentration camp clothes.
2.0,"Too thin, scratchy and doubt will hold up. Doxie design is very cute."
2.0,"Such a cute dress, but because of the material, there is no give, so when I tried the dress on, my chest either was squeezed below the babydoll hem, or choked my neck. If you're average size is a US 10, thats about what it feels like if you buy XL. I just wish this dress fit because I would get so much use out of it!"
2.0,Cute for the 2 times a was able to wear them.  The bottom seam got a giant split after 2 wears.
2.0,"It looks nice but doesn't work well with 1.5 inch belts. From all appearances that's the belt size this is made for but I have a half dozen belts that size and it doesn't work with any. When trying to use it the loop at the back that attaches the belt to the buckle just pops off. If this is made for a 1 1/4"" belt only then that should be in the description. Guess I have to buy another belt now."
2.0,"Beautiful, but won't stay on!"
2.0,"Fit in the body was fine, arms were too short. Also, the stitching was off. I ordered this coat thinking it was the Steve Madden one I liked, I tried it on, and realized it didn't fit well, and the how it was made was off. It didn't bellow at the bottom like in the picture. The front was, really weird. I ordered the actual coat from Steve Madden, and the sleeves fit fine , and of course the stitching is correct. Beware if you're looking for the Steve Madden coat!"
2.0,Very large - not at all delicate.  &#34;Green Turquoise&#34; is misleading . . . . 'stones' are black. QUality comensurate with price.  Service very good.
2.0,"Cute style, but VERY see through.<br />Even nude underwear was visible. Will be returning."
2.0,"Large fit exactly as expected, however the material was some kind of polyester and the creases from being packaged would not come out of the material despite multiple washings. Also the color is not even close to &#34;Ivory,&#34; it was more of a yellowish beige, so returned it."
2.0,Took forever to arrive the quality is not great it has seams and thread lose and the sweater is itchy to wear
2.0,"These are huge.  I know it states the size, but I really wasn't expecting them to be so big.  Fortunately, I was able to give them to someone with tackier taste."
2.0,We haven‚Äôt even used the lunch box and it has a huge hole. The backpack is super cute and seems to be holding up fine.
2.0,"Upon removing the necklace from the box, by first thought was ""cheap and flimsy. It feels like it would easily break so I am going to have to be very careful with it"" (at least I won't have to worry about that now).<br /><br />I was not impressed with the necklace on first impressions. It is nothing special, and again, it looks cheap. Then I tried it on. The ring to insert the clasp into is pretty small, so if you struggle with that sort of thing, you will have a hard time with this. If you think it will look like the one on the girl in picture in the ad, you'd be wrong, as it is smaller than that. That false advertising really aggravates me. Once I got it closed and looked in the mirror, the ""final straw"" problem with this necklace presented itself. The gold heart does not stay right side up when the necklace is on. It goes sideways and a bit upside down. This is a no brainier. Back it goes. I wouldn't pay more than ten bucks for a necklace of this quality (at the MOST), and it was 3 times that amount. I find it suitable only for children/teens, but I have seen similar or better for less on Amazon. I gave it 2 stars just because I have seen worse."
2.0,"The matching belt does NOT come with it, the description is deceitful."
2.0,"On the second day of use, the mittens already had a rip at a seam and multiple cracks."
2.0,"Love the look, but in some places was poorly put together."
2.0,It shrunk after a couple of washes
2.0,Weak on holding togetherzippervand a couple of seams split with little pressure or might by some be considered overload. Though material was not in our opinion stretched. Just poor quality or workmanship.
2.0,This I got for my photo shots for a 2 month old baby. Real nice but too small !!!!! It is so small it almost fits in my jewelry box! Get the Idea!  So no i would not buy it if i new. I rather spend $10 more and get a bigger one...
2.0,"Cute, but only colored on one side"
2.0,"One missing from pack, but they were to bing"
2.0,"The post is so long that this stud can't really settle nicely in your nose.  It's always sticking out.  Unless you've got an extremely wide nose, I would not recommend this one."
2.0,The top was too tight. I have a larger bust and I cannot even close the buttons on the top. I am giving it away to someone that has a smaller upper body and curvy hips.
2.0,"The shirt in the picture is super comfy and relaxed looking...the real product doesn't fit right and has a very cheap look and feel to it. The material is heavy and clingy and the seams on the shoulder are half way down my upper arm while the overall length of the shirt is barely enough to hit my shirt. I was definitely not impressed. Surprisingly, I ordered the same shirt in a different size and color and received it from a different seller....this shirt (from Haola) fits great, is really cute and feels way less cheap. If you order this, don't order the Weigou version or you'll be disappointed."
2.0,"too teeny, tiny for my pre teen granddaughter"
2.0,Not great fit for anyone with a longer torso.
2.0,"attractive bag that holds a lot of items, however the mesh of the zippered compartment came apart as soon as added items. Not good quality or quality control."
2.0,2 of the 5 arrived broken.  They were cheap enough that I didn't bother returning. The other 3 are fine...
2.0,"Do not allow yourself to be fooled by the picture online. It's not as great as it seems. It arrived to me and when I opened up the package, it looked like I just purchased a flimsy theater vest for a floozy costume. It's that bad. Not as extravagant as it appears on the Amazon picture."
2.0,"I liked how it looked online, but in reality It is quite cheap looking. I have had it now for several weeks and have not worn it."
2.0,Darling dress idea! I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 175 lbs. my bust is a 38D/DD or 40 D depending on make/style of bra. Been wanting a Jean dress & after reading so many reviews on so many dresses‚Ä¶ purchased this one with hopes of coming back to purchase in pink and with floral faith Hope love.  Well‚Ä¶ I love princess waist or high waist tops‚Ä¶ but this waist cut across my nipple line! (I‚Äôve had a reduction & lift so my breast location was not the problem here‚Ä¶)<br />The length was perfect for my long legs‚Ä¶. But the back of the dress went OUT past my booty and could have fit literally 5 of me in the bottom of this dress!!! ü§≠<br />I don‚Äôt know if I happened to receive a really misname mistake of their line‚Ä¶ but I TRULY HAD HIGH HOPES!!!üò¢ I did unfortunately have to return it!<br />  It totally was a darling concept for the dress!! I had an acid wash Jean skirt in high school that was my absolute fav! The looks of the back of this dress reminded me of that skirt‚Ä¶.until it arrived!<br />  Shop Owner: please consider a remake of this dress as it is such a cute concept if it could look just like the pics!!
2.0,"When I first received these eyeglasses, I thought I had found a great deal.  After trying on all three pair and examining them closely, I realized I was wrong.  Compared to the Newbee Fashion eyeglasses they have &#34;Pros'.  Mainly the arms are long enough to wear them on the tip of of your nose.  However, that's where positives end.  First, the 3 pair are different.  One of the pairs are put together with screws,  the other 2 use rivits.  The lenses cannot be easily removed from any frame.  They are pressed into the frames and don't have any way to loosen or tighten them back.  The frame that has screws on the nose pads and arms have bad lenses.  Looking at my phone, the center appears cupped and I get headaches.  Since that pair has the better frame, I tried switching lenses.  Removing them was hard enough, replacing them was impossible. I took photos comparing the nosepads.  Unfortunately, I got frustrated and threw them out before taking photos of the hinges.  I wouldn't buy them again!"
2.0,Dim lights on some
2.0,"After measuring and going by the size chart, I ordered this top and it arrived and to my disappointment it was incredibly tight around the breast and the material is unforgiving. The design looked cool but it was just not going to look good on a larger chest (DDD)."
2.0,"I haven't used the product because it hurts my nose oh, it's too tight on my nose"
2.0,Not for people with thighs... You would think these would work under your skirts to keep from changing NOT 8if you have bigger thighs these won't work. They just roll up and are really not long enough.
2.0,"I like the pattern and the pockets are a great size, but the waist line is all wrong. I'm pulling them up every two minutes!"
2.0,"They are pretty large, like triple the size of a standard Pearl. But the part I don't like is these little rubber things for the backs of the ears, they fall off."
2.0,Way too thin! I will not be putting any pendants on it and that it what I purchased it for. My pendants were not cheap and I am afraid the necklace will break and I will lose my pendant!
2.0,"I loved these cute sandals when they arrived.  They are well made and very stylish, however I had to return them.  My feet are medium width and the straps over my foot were too big.  If you have wider feet or if the top of your foot is high, these sandals would probably be perfect."
2.0,"Was so disappointed, product said Red, it was not, it was Orange.<br />My picture shows a true Red sweater up against what they consider Red.<br />Very cheaply made, and would advise against purchasing it if you want a true Red."
2.0,These are not sized for American women. A 5x is about a medium in America.
2.0,"We sent these back.  They were two sizes too big and they smelled so strongly of the packaging that even if they had fit, we wouldn't have kept them.  I can't speak to if they were comfortable or worked in the water - we didn't keep them long enough to find out.  The color was great though!"
2.0,On the positive side this is a beautiful dress.  Unfortunately it runs SEVERAL sizes too small.  I ordered according to the size chart provided by the retailer and I sized up one more size.  It didn't even come close to fitting. The jacket fit across the shoulders but fit like a shrug jacket across the chest.  And the zipper didn't zip at all!  I recommend ordering several sizes up if you are a plus size or curvy.  I am in the process of returning it for a refund.
2.0,"From the pictures you cannot tell if it is a man's or a woman's bracelet. A male friend of mine liked it and wanted it. I ordered it for Christmas. It is too small for a man. Plus there are not measurements (that I could find) on the page that I ordered from. Also, it is not adjustable. As for quality, it appears to be good and strong. I still like the appearance and style, but sizing is the problem."
2.0,"Loved the color but because there were so many loose strings and the shirt was so big under the arms, I couldn't make it work.  The color is more like picture 2 and 3 (don't know why the lighting changed so much between pictures)."
2.0,"t's not ""loose"" as stated in the Description, or the way it's shown in the picture. The band/cuff area is quite tight, and doesn't drape the way you expect it to from the picture of the product."
2.0,"Inaccurate sizing! The listing says it fits 2T-4T which is a joke. The hat might fit a 1yr old and the gloves may fit about a 3yr old. Needless to say, the hat does not fit my 2.5yr old and the gloves have a little growing room. Very disappointing that the cute hat doesn't fit."
2.0,"Definitely poor quality; I wish I would've just saved my money and bought something nicer. I'm a size small, and ordered a medium, but it was still way too small, and way too short on me. I constantly have to pull it down, as the shirt will ride up; super annoying while trying to run - I've had to just try to tuck the shirt into my shorts to get it to stay in place. The fabric is also very thin compared to other athletic shirts I've bought in the past; makes me afraid that it'll fall apart."
2.0,"It is SO sheer that I really can't see myself wearing it anywhere but around the house. The pockets give your body a weird looking shape too. It's definitely comfortable, but it wasn't worth the wait."
2.0,The bathing suit is of good quality but I follow the size chart and it still was not the right size to small ;(
2.0,"I like how they look but they are falsely listed at .25&#34; but they are really .5&#34; and bigger than I was looking for, 2 stars for not having accurate product description"
2.0,"I love the look, but the metal on the ones I got was very flimsy.  When I took the earrings out of the box part of one of the backs broke off in my hand."
2.0,Didn't like the fit on me. I ended up returning it.
2.0,Ski goggles provide little protection with a foam liner. I am a beginner skier so these work fine for me.
2.0,"I like the shirt, it's great quality, looks classy, but I am 5'10&#34; and this shirt stops above my belly button, I'm modest, I'm not the type to show off my lower torso, that being said, it's too short, a bit too tight around the armpits, but it looks classy on me, so I wear it with a shirt under it, which looks hideous. Please make this shirt longer."
2.0,Some watches could not be programmed.
2.0,"I think I would be much better pig with a combination, sock and calf compression, instead l of the stocking. Am returning."
2.0,"I didnt like arm part.You have to have perfect fit arm to look nice.Like in that picture, thin girl and everything looks great!I am size L, ordered dress XL, and beside that arms didnt look good, also waistline very high and didnt fit, I had to stretch it out! Lace was pretty!Together all dress for seemed a little bit sad!I tried different little shoulder covers and nothing really fit!Black color made the dress darker!Fabric under the lace felt good, but it was yellowish, which didnt go together with my skin color.I sent it back!"
2.0,The other reviews are correct. I would order a size larger because when you put it on the color fade to white when stretched. Also the material i not that great.The look and style are great just wasn't for me.
2.0,The socks look nice but I had a hole in the toe before the end of the first day
2.0,Unable to hook it.The hole is too tight.
2.0,It came in an 8√ó10 envelope. Paper thin and short nothing about it says high waist. Disappointed
2.0,Of the three bands received only the black one works.  The magnets are so weak on the other two they come off with very little movement.  After having the bands come off several times while walking I'm afraid to wear anything but the black for fear of losing my fitbit watch
2.0,Nice design but broke after a month
2.0,way too small like three sizes
2.0,These ride up my backside terribly.  I‚Äôm constantly picking my seat.
2.0,Got the wrong item
2.0,Did not work with included remotes
2.0,They don‚Äôt hold up with the bra to absorb sweat.
2.0,"I looks very nice, but mine has arrived with a scratch :(<br />I am very upset, as I don‚Äôt feel comfortable to use it. New things do not suppose to be damaged from the very beginning."
2.0,Pictures that are advertising are not what you really receive
2.0,"It's cute, but runs small and thin fabric."
2.0,The glitter was pretty faint on it I‚Äôll be touching it up before my daughters birthday and I did not receive the matching bow that was to go with her outfit.
2.0,Shirt is runs a size smaller. Love the material of the shirt
2.0,Way to small and material is not good as well
2.0,"The shirt had some weird shiny spots in several spots, which made it seem lower quality. Plus, I can‚Äôt see myself being happy wearing a shirt labeled Coofandy‚Ä¶ I just keep seeing Goofcandy. I didn‚Äôt try it on, just decided to return it."
2.0,"I ordered this in a S (5'4"", 112, 34a) and the fit was great and the colors cute, but the collar was wider on one side than the other. I liked it so much I tried ordering a second one, but it also had a collar with different widths on each side. It was also a little more stiff and seemingly less flexible than some of the others I tried on. Going back."
2.0,I disliked the fact that it was advertised as cotton but it is polyester! False advertisement!
2.0,"I am not impressed by this suitcase. It is the right size, but the wheels, handle and interior clips look cheap and flimsy"
2.0,All the wrong size only two fit
2.0,It was a larger lense than the Bolle edge 2
2.0,I like the color and the print. I would size up 2 or 3 sizes! It fits but it‚Äôs super tight. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äô‚Äô and weigh about 160. I usually wear a medium and ordered a large and it was still super tight.
2.0,"They shoes are soft, but run much smaller than expected."
2.0,No real help for night vision. Kept falling off.
2.0,Runs very small and narrowüëéüëéüëé but are super cute
2.0,"Muy anchos en la parte de atr√°s, parecen de mujeres de avanzada edad."
2.0,It‚Äôs a nice shirt with a decent design and feel but definitely order atleast a size if not 2 sizes up. Was small and then it shrunk a lot on first wash
2.0,"Poor, not clear."
2.0,"Followed the sizing instructions written by the seller and read some reviews and the skirt fit horribly, way too big. It‚Äôs a beautiful skirt, great material and doesn‚Äôt seem cheaply made, just the sizing was totally wrong . FYI, I am 5‚Äô4 145 pounds and I ordered the medium. Will be returning."
2.0,"There cute but the craftsmanship on some of these was poor. Some of mine had leftover rubber around the cut out I easily fixed it but I‚Äôm not into doing someone else‚Äôs job and some of them had a black face and white body, one eye was black one black was white, there was a random white girl in there too so Yeah kinda sloppy so just look carefully."
2.0,We've had this watch less than a year and it no longer works.  Wanted to try changing the battery but can't get it open to try that.  Can't find any information on manufacturer or who to call.  Watch has a 1 year warranty (per instructions included and Amazon info) but what's the use if one can't find any info.  So tired of cheap crap from overseas!
2.0,I purchased as a gift but the person I gave it to  was not a fan. It is an okay product
2.0,Material was ok but too big had to return it
2.0,Doesn't work well for someone with a large chest. Ended up returning
2.0,"Extremely late shipping date.  By the time we received it there was not time to find another one.  Ordered a 3x, my husband wears a 2x8 and this was way to small. Seller sends an templated response.  Only decent thing about the suit is the beard.  Cheaply made and crotch seam was not completely sewn. Would Not recommend."
2.0,Cute but doesn't hold glass arm tight for long.
2.0,"Cute cardigan, but it only made it through the washer once (flat dried) and the threading started to come out. I fixed the hem myself."
2.0,It looks cool I really liked it and it was really cheap the problem is it was really cheap like a week and a half after getting it it is broke I don‚Äôt know why
2.0,You will not be putting these on in a hurry you have to put them in the hole to fasten I waited to long an can‚Äôt send back
2.0,"I have purchased AJ Morgan glasses before. I really like the Castro ones they make. Unlike those glasses, these feel cheap and have a harsher look than in the picture. I returned them the same day."
2.0,Really had high hopes for this jacket but the sizing is way off almost 1 complete size smaller
2.0,It look like cheap fabric
2.0,"Received this from a Mugen Authorized reseller, in a genuine unopened box with label.  But the keychain itself seems very cheaply made - lightweight rings, poorly cut leather (clearly not rectangular, more trapezoidal in shape) and the metal Mugen plate is stuck on with very cheap glue.  Bending the  keychain slightly easily separates the metal plate from the leather.  Very glad I didn't pay full price for this, but IMO it's more of a $10 piece."
2.0,I gave this a 2-Star because I ordered a pack of 2 pairs and I only received 1 pair.  Due to the pandemic there's no customer support so I will be returning it
2.0,It looks good but I don't like the material.
2.0,"These shoes were about 3 inches too long. In addition, the rainbow was poorly glued AND way off center!"
2.0,No real support in the cups. To thin.
2.0,"Really thin see through fabric, too short."
2.0,too difficult to program
2.0,"I ordered the pink sweatshirt because I loved the dusty pink. However, I received A pepto pink sweatshirt. It‚Äôs pretty cheap feeling and not quite true to size, slightly smaller fit. I plan To return mine."
2.0,"Very cheap feel, very thin, caused a reaction for me the first day. They look ok, but the quality is not there."
2.0,I usually love this brand but the sweatpants I ordered from here fit like a small 3x but I had a stain on my knee and the fabric seemed like it had holes in it. Like little teeny tiny holes like the fabric wasn't woven together enough. I will be sending back unfortunately.
2.0,Charm is hollow in the back and the chain pop easy
2.0,"The sizing chart is two sizes off, easily more. Way too small."
2.0,"Unfortunately, these slippers gripped too well which increased my dad's fall risk. He wore them for a few hours &#34; to give them a good try&#34;, but had to remove them because they almost tripped him. In addition, he said the elastic left a mark on his foot. Since he has diabetic neuropathy, this increased his chance of skin breakdown. So....not a good choice for him."
2.0,They are not as nice as pictured. It looks like there is missing gems around the boot.
2.0,"The quality of the jogging suit was really good, the pants were droopy in between the crouch"
2.0,Too small.  I ended up donating it b/c I was too lazy to send back.  Very thin.
2.0,The color was more of a pinkish then a red.
2.0,Item was not sized as described.
2.0,"The ring came on time however, upon further inspection of the piece I found certain details in the ring that I did not like. The braided border was kinked and uneven and the ring runs a little smaller even though I made an allowance in sizing and ordered the next size up. I'm just so very disappointed."
2.0,They fit well but only come with one not 3. I got the white and grey and they both only came with one not the 3 it states
2.0,Fell off and lost within a week of purchase and hanging
2.0,Too small around waste area
2.0,"Didn't  like  any thing, would not buy again or recommend"
2.0,The gadgets on the glove fell off immediately. Leather is nice but disappointing.
2.0,They changed colour after 3 wears
2.0,"Fits small on the waist area, returned it."
2.0,These gloves are too thin and rip every time I put one on.  Also I had ordered large for my husband and they sent small.  Too much of a hassle for me to return them so I‚Äôve been using them for myself.  Wouldn‚Äôt order again.
2.0,was excited to get my package for this item. was disappointed to see there was a rip straight out of the bag.
2.0,"The material felt like a table cloth and not soft like flannel.  I sent it back and ordered a different robe - an oh-so-soft cotton jersey.  Hopefully, it won't be itchy and scratchy like this one"
2.0,The mask doesn‚Äôt give me any comfort for breathing. I don‚Äôt like them at all
2.0,These pants look nothing like the picyure and have pleated fronts which you can not see in the picture. Poor stitching threads  sticking out all over.
2.0,They were metal. Nit very comfortable. Meterals need to be described.
2.0,"The style is super cute. However, the got is awkward. The top gives no support. Would be great if it was sized like bras for a better fit."
2.0,The zipper broke the first time I wore it. So disappointed.
2.0,"One pair arrived fine, the other pair, not so much. The finish is bumpy and tarnished. They look old and beat up.  Waste of money. üòî"
2.0,"Small!! I have a 27 inch waist, I couldn't get it around me. My daughter loves it though."
2.0,"Completely different product - different leopard, different cut & bright white buttons. 2 stars for price"
2.0,"This item looks of better quality in the picture than what was actually received. The jacket seems more like a short robe than a stylish jacket. I have not been able to position it on my body so that it looks like it does in the picture. Even though the item came 40% off of $39.99, the $26 and change I paid still seems a little too much. It is warm however and has deep pockets, the grey doesn‚Äôt have a zipper like in the description. The material used could pass as a child‚Äôs Halloween costume of a furry animal, like you find at a retail store during Halloween. Disappointed with this item for a stylish jacket."
2.0,"The clasp is nice, but the leather is stiff and takes a long time to lay down. Did not last very long."
2.0,"I was very excited to order this dress. The picture looked so cute and the dress looked so fancy. The color in the picture is very elegant and a person would think that this is the perfect dress for night parties and wedding. That is why I liked it when I first saw it online. It was newly listed and there were no reviews on this dress yet. I wanted to check some reviews as anyone would do since clothes online tend to be so different in real life. So I got this dress for free to try it on and give you guys my honest review about it. I received the dress recently and I was shocked. I mean I expected it to be different but not to this level.<br />I have attached a picture for you guys so you can judge for yourselves.<br />The bottom part ( the blue skirt) is very cheap quality. It is very thin and soft fabric, closer to fake satin. The color is so off, you can compare both pictures and see how the quality and the color are different. The top black part is kind of better quality in comparison to the bottom part.<br />I will never wear this to any event. Maybe I could wear it to a Halloween party lol.  Other than that I do not think that the listed price fits the quality and the shape of this dress.<br /><br />Disclaimer. I received this product with a discount to give my honest review about this specific product. I was not influenced by the seller to write a good a review, but rather I gave my honest review.<br />when I write reviews, I rate the product by the following labels:<br />1 star: I hate it.<br />2 stars: I do not like it.<br />3 stars: It is okay.<br />4 stars: I like it.<br />5 stars: I love it."
2.0,Luckily I caught the little gem that fell out Not only was the gym not secure but trying to screw in the lip ring it extremely difficult it is to small
2.0,Just a weird fit and poor quality .
2.0,"This product has a great look, is light and comfortable, and has done its job protecting my watch from scratches and nicks at work. The issue is the plastic buckle that hooks into the band, as it is the weakest part of the whole unit. After about three weeks the buckle snapped off the band on the first one I received, so I returned it for a replacement. The second one only lasted half as long. If they could strengthen that particular link of the chain, it would be a great product for the price they're asking. Return process #2 is only allowing a refund and not a replacement."
2.0,the watch looses time about two minutes a day.
2.0,"The two starts are for fit alone. The fit would be 5 stars for me, but they lost soooo much on the wite screenprinted design that I almost gave this a 1 (because they don't let you give a zero). I thought this was either embroidered or a stitched on applique. But it's plastic screen print. Did I keep it? Yes. Will I wear it? Yes. But that's because I need a light-weight solution to to dress up the leggings and t-shirts that fit my current postpartum body during office hours. I actually wish this were just a plain color because I do love the fit. I'm just disappointed in the quality of the design."
2.0,"Looks cheap, my bad. I did not used it."
2.0,"I needed this shirt as part of a work uniform.  Usually an XL fits perfectly. However, not this particular item. Either it runs very small or it shrunk during shipment!"
2.0,"Comfortable cloth mask, but way to small for adults. Not like the gray masks from them."
2.0,"I liked the look of the boots and they seemed to fit fine but the first time I put them on the loop at the back broke on both boots.  Not a good sign of quality and, for these boots, you really need the loop to get them on properly.  I sent them back."
2.0,The anchor finish is coming off and looks very bad.
2.0,"If you are planning on using this as a conch jewelry like the image, it is too big! Wayyyy too big. I cut it in half so only 3 stones were on it, and it's still far too big for my conch piercing.<br /><br />It also screws from both sides of the post, which is pain and I'm worried it will get lost.<br /><br />But pro, it comes in a pair which I wasn't expecting."
2.0,"I ordered two of these and although they fit great, the material peeled badly after less than a handful of washes.  I washed them in delicate cycle and hung dry but that didn't stop the fabric from peeling and having lint balls all over.  Too bad because I really like the way they fitted and wanted to order more in different colors.  I also ordered two in 3/4 sleeves with ruches on the sides from the same shop and LOVE them; those were made with different fabric that was soft and doesn't pill."
2.0,"Dress is to long  for me, material cheap."
2.0,Cute but too damn short. So the length in the pic is not what you get!
2.0,Not worth buying. Very thin
2.0,"These are not near as fluffy and cute as the picture. You can definitely tell they are very cheaply made. They're pretty much flat, so if you like big fluffy flower bows this is not what you will get."
2.0,"Loved the amethyst, but the rest was of poor quality and way too big. The stone is heavy and rotates on the wrist to where ist lays underneath it which will easily scratch and damage a soft stone such as an amethyst. Returning it."
2.0,My GF really Liked the colors but the jewelry broke in the packaging seemed like a hassle to try to return or refund.!. please beware OK?
2.0,"Use to order these all the time, my husband loved them. Now the waistband is different, they're too short in the legs and ride up. Thought we just got a bad pair so returned and reordered but 2nd pair was the same. Wish they would go back to the original manufacturing."
2.0,I gave this shirt away it was HUGE and I could not wear it
2.0,"Definitely not the sweater pictured. In the picture, it appears to be thinner and flowy at the ends. The sweater I received is so large that it‚Äôs almost comical, really thick, and sinched at the ends to make me look like a balloon. It is well made and seems strong/sturdy, but just not what I expected from looking at the picture. Also, there is no way to verify if I actually got the size I ordered because there are no tags sewn onto it."
2.0,Odered twice and twice they sent me the wrong size. They were both Med and did not fit
2.0,"Ordered 3 packs of the pink/black/white and we got the pink/blue/white with stars patterns on all 3 bags.  Good price, nice variety but my picky kids are not happy they didn't get the correct packages.  Why allow patterns choices if you are just going to send something else?"
2.0,"Good at holding my shirt down but it felt too tight. I nneded more slack, something a teller guy can use"
2.0,"I ordered this slipper, but broke after 2 months. Very sad :("
2.0,"I intended to wear this pendant on a chain I already own, and good thing, too, because the chain on which this pendant arrives is incredibly small, weak and cheap looking. The pendant itself is very large and heavy.  It's too heavy for any chain that I own.  It's a very &#34;solid&#34; piece and not dainty or feminine to me.  Also the blue in the stone is a little dark for my aquamarine preferences."
2.0,"I could have done without it. The material is low quality, the sleeves look silly, but fast shipping."
2.0,"The camel color is not khaki, it is more of an orange mustard nude. I attached a khaki colored beanie to show how not khaki the ‚Äúcamel‚Äù color is. I am normally a small but I bought a large to fit super thick sweatshirts under and for it to still be lose, but I should have just gone medium. I would say they run large, this large feels like an XL.<br />If you‚Äôre going for a specific color, you can‚Äôt trust the pictures at all so I would look somewhere else. But if you don‚Äôt care about color, they do feel thick and warm, if that‚Äôs what your going for I think this is good. I would wear something warm underneath to be very comfortable, I get cold easily."
2.0,These are great...if you‚Äôre a baby. So small the post barley went through my cartilage
2.0,"Half the button holes were too small for the button to pass through, and had to be fixed.<br />More than half the buttons were literally hanging by a single thread, and the rest were so loosely sewn that they unraveled at a touch. Had to hand-sew all the buttons.<br />Disappointing. A seller I will have to avoid."
2.0,The size is too small (for the one listed). Inaccurate sizing but the fabric is fine. What a shame. 2-stars Given
2.0,"The top is cute, the sales picture looks far more ruffles than real product<br />The bottoms are 6 sizes too big and short."
2.0,I love the length but the neck is poorly constructed. It just flips sloppy. Material and length is great but I just resold it at my garage sale. It made me look sloppy
2.0,"The cover isn‚Äôt quite as dark as the photo lets on, but it isn‚Äôt terrible. The sides were chipped when I got them, the packaging left much to be desired. Aside from those annoyances, not bad."
2.0,The sizing is more for a child than an adult.
2.0,"These were super cute and fit my daughter perfectly, but the quality is VERY cheap. They have fallen apart in just a few weeks. The bow fell apart in a few days. I wouldn't recommend!"
2.0,The orange color shown in the picture is wrong; the color is actually a bright neon orange.
2.0,"I like the bag. It's quite sturdy. I have only used it on one flight so far and it has held up very well. I'm not sure it will last much longer. Certainly a great option if you need something that you can use for a few times. I loaded the bag with 70lbs and it held up well without any issues. I agree with the other reviewer that the straps are too long. Makes it very difficult to carry.<br /><br />Update, the bag completely tore on the 2nd flight. Pictures attached. A bit disappointing."
2.0,"I like the fact that there a few colors strings attached, this way u can always match it to your outfit:) I disliked the fact that strings snapped pretty quickly though& would actually like to return my item&get a FULL refund. TYlike to"
2.0,"I ordered a size 4 for my 3 year old, and I also ordered a blue one in size 2T for my 1 year old. The blue one fits well, but the pink one is the exact same size as the coat for my 2 year old, and is too small for my 3 year old. I gave it to my sister with an 18 month old. It had a stain on one button and the tags were already removed, as if it had been returned and they did not size it correctly when they received it back."
2.0,"Does not look like the picture, the crescent moon and cent diamond are way bigger."
2.0,"Received promptly. Packaging was decent. Watch same as site pic, HOWEVER, watch was defective-either dead battery or other. Returned same day as received."
2.0,SO pretty but insanely small. I'm 5'7&#34; and 150lbs - I couldn't even get it over my average size butt.  So disappointing because the fabric is gorgeous.
2.0,"This product runs very very small I bought an extra large like I normally wear, and their way to small"
2.0,"Beautiful bracelet that I purchased to remind me to live in the moment. Unfortunately, the bracelet links opened up after a week of wearing it and it's broken. Would love to speak to the seller to see if they can make it right."
2.0,I know the difference based on the feel and breathability of cotton.... these are not cotton despite being listed as such.  The tag even says 100% cotton but they're not.  They feel like possibly polyester.  I am returning.
2.0,Way ros.all my daughter takes a 10/12 so I ordered up a size 14/16 and it is really tight and small.
2.0,I about to return this very cheap and way to big
2.0,"This is actually quite a lovely watch. It‚Äôs pretty and delicate and basically everything I wanted in a watch design - except for *functional.*  At first, I thought that maybe I had just forgotten to push the button in after I set the time, but every time I reset it, it is completely wrong (though the hands have moved. And the second had is moving) and hour or two later. I need a watch for situations where I can‚Äôt use my phone, not just an accessory!  It is literally a bracelet at this point."
2.0,Cute reindeer design but there seems to be a too narrow cut of front panels. Probably size up if you want to try this.
2.0,It's pretty but I thought was more long.
2.0,Product was so big wouldn't fit around my head. Ear loops 2 different sizes so they fit everyone else crooked. Cant wear them!
2.0,Poor material. Seemed low in quality
2.0,Cut is not flattering to anyone with a figure. It's very boxy and baggy. But as a lounge shirt it's comfortable. I have the ability to alter my own clothes so for the price for me I can make it work.
2.0,"I bought them as a gift, but decided to toss them. The quality is very poor"
2.0,"I ordered my size based on their chart. The entire dress is a misfit.  The shoulders fall off mine, the bodice is cut so low 1 1/2 inches of my bra is higher than the dress front.  The waistline hits mid ribs, just the length of the dress is good.  The material appears faded and worn even fresh from the package.  This is the first item I‚Äôll return in a long time.  I‚Äôm not sure what size or age it was made for, but certainly not for me!"
2.0,"Out of 40, 14 were not working.  I emailed Amazon and received a prompt reply that they were not able to replace the defective items since the seller does not always have them.  They processed my refund and sent me a mailing label to print out to return my items.  I had written asking for either replacements or a refund.  I repackaged the item and am dropping it off at a nearby UPS outlet.  Very pleased with Amazon and the speed at which I received my shipment and response to my email.<br /><br />I had seen the reviews that said they received some lights that didn't work.  I was hoping it wouldn't be that many but with 1/4 of the shipment defective I would rather not keep them.<br /><br />*****Another note: they were coated with some sort of white powder.  As I was going through the lights, it was all over my hands.  I think it was on the bands that you put around your finger.  I have no idea if they are made from latex but beware if you have an allergy.  I asked about the powder and didn't get a response about it.  I am not allergic so it isn't much of an issue for me."
2.0,This worked out great for the top of my Alice in Wonderland Christmas tree. It wouldn‚Äôt be a good buy for a costume. It is cheaply made.
2.0,"looks better in picture,  the string to hold/ tie to make it secure on your head against wind -its too skinny that will  not last."
2.0,It's ok for a cheap hat.
2.0,Over half of the rocks had chips or were broken.  They will need to be spackled in order to be painted.
2.0,It's a beautiful watch but the day of week hand fell off the second day I had it.
2.0,Runs small& tight. Order at least 2 sizes up. Other than that it's pretty.
2.0,Very cheaply made. Smaller than expected & dimensions are off - even shorter than pictured. I won‚Äôt be able to wear.
2.0,"Top was a great fit, but bottoms are made for a child size person. Have to return."
2.0,Horrible quality stitching. The waistline was way off.
2.0,"This is the 2nd pair in size 14 short.  the first one fits great (although I wear a 16 in Talbots stretch relaxed jeans  so I originally ordered a 16 short at it was huge hence the 14 short, which fits great.  So I ordered a second pair and it is big, pull right down without undoing button or zipper.  its like the 16 short, checked tags all marked as 14 short.  so I am sending back to exchange for another 14 short.  I guess that will determine if the 14 shorts that fit are actually more like a 12 short or actually a 14 short."
2.0,Cheap metal but stoned are beautiful
2.0,Poor quality. Is not according to picture show it.
2.0,Broke in one week /:
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt look at all like the picture
2.0,Beads did not fit my waist. I have tons of waist beads.....these were pretty but extremely delicate.
2.0,Shoes look nice but they run very very small for boys.
2.0,"I have a few pairs of stretchy CK slacks for work (all aid which are size 12). Usually the 12s fit like a true women‚Äôs medium, but have enough stretch that they never feel too tight that I can‚Äôt bend down or so loose that they‚Äôll stretch out and sag by the end of the day. These pants were way larger than any pairs that I‚Äôve purchased‚Äî like XLs or even XXLs. I can‚Äôt even say that I would know how far to size down because that‚Äôs how much larger these were than any other CK 12s I own. Good luck!"
2.0,"I typically wear 18W, 1X, 2X, or XXL in women's US clothing sizes. This vest in size XXL was way too small for me. It fits more like a medium. It seems well made, but the material is thin. One of the outside pockets has a hole in it. There is one pocket on the inside. Even though I can't even dream about zipping this thing up, I was able to get my arms through, so technically I could wear it under a jacket for added warmth. I'm not going to do that, though."
2.0,Not the best material and the waist bend moves when wearing it. I don't recommend.
2.0,Band does not look like pictures.  Would not fit my brand new Samsung Galaxy Active watch!!  Was really bummed and extremely upset ‚òπÔ∏èüòî!<br />In the photos it appears to taper and states for men/women.  This is definitely a man's watchband!!
2.0,I was hoping for a much better quality.
2.0,I was so excited to receive these BUT they don‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôm bummed about it. As out of all the pants I was most excited to get these in.
2.0,"Way bigger and heavier than I thought, or would have bought in person. And I ordered the smaller one. Can't just remove bars for handstraps because it leaves holes. Otherwise beautiful."
2.0,I ordered a larger size than I usually wear and it was too small. Also the material was itchy. I am returning.
2.0,The look was cute.  It felt way too bulky
2.0,"Very disappointed.  I got this a size larger because I know that items coming from overseas can run small, but this is ridiculous.  I purchase an XXL, and couldn't even get it over my shoulders.  I wear a size 14 in US standard size."
2.0,"The material is strange, not what I was expecting at all, feels like its made out of thin plastic almost."
2.0,did not like. leaked.
2.0,"They are a bit small, no elastic at the waist... not comfortable"
2.0,Love this dress but after just one wash it came apart at the seams.
2.0,"I am 5'7"".. usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.. 38 E/F  I ordered the xxl.  The top and body are loosely fit.  The bottom with the tie is oddly shaped.  You have to tie the tie very tightly because other wise there is a big loop that shows 'open' if you try to loosely tie.  The real issue is that the should cut outs are so poorly placed the holes are to the BACK of your arm!  I tried to reposition several different times and the openings will just not stay forward.  So weird looking, not ideal.  The color is a very pleasant true coral (pink/orange).  The material is very soft, but wrinkly.  Honestly, in my opinion this blouse is poorly made and the material is poor.  I would pass.  I would donate this, but in all honesty, its just too poorly made even for that. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."
2.0,"So, first of all, the company sent me the wrong size...I ordered a small and they sent me a large. So I cannot speak to how accurately this swimsuit actually fits. The swimsuit material is okay, but where the cutouts are the material is very thin so I worry that it will easily tear with normal wear and tear. I guess for the price it isn't horrible but it's definitely not the best."
2.0,Didn't last long in the salt water. Lens scratch very easily and purple color comes off fast
2.0,THE FOAM PADDING IS ALMOST NON EXSISTENT
2.0,Got these in an 8 but they do not fit like a size 8. They fit my aunt who is a size 7. So order a size up in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall they are very cute and they seem to be made very well but with the price and them running down that small in size I‚Äôm really honestly disappointed because they can‚Äôt be worn and I‚Äôll have to donate them to My aunt.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful for you.
2.0,"It looks okay, but it's pretty uncomfortable (it's not flexible at all). Also, the clasp part broke off as soon as I went to take it off to replace with a new band."
2.0,No different than regular compression socks. They are still difficult to put on and take off. When I get them on and wear them all day they do not do anything different than regular compression socks.  Just all lot of hype for these socks.
2.0,"The length of the shoe is perfect to my size 7.5-8 foot. The arche support feels great. However, it is too tight around my toes. It seems to run narrow and no room to stretch or give since it‚Äôs plastic."
2.0,"This watch was on a page that sold Timex watches - my first choice in a watch.  When I received the watch, it was VERY heavy , and I noticed it has no second hand. I use this feature daily.  When you set it, you can only turn the dial in a clockwise direction, which turns the hand in the opposite direction needed.  The directions caution you to not turn the dials in the opposite direction as you may damage the workings. It is clunky and if you don't wear it every day, it stops. Bad investment for me."
2.0,I thought that it was going to be a soft material as I own another pair that is and instead is was cheaper made and shiney.  Very disspointed.
2.0,"Disliked how the shoe is sized, don't know what to order."
2.0,Wish it came bigger.  Xxl was more like xl.  I‚Äôm too fat for size.
2.0,"after having the band for a while, the band has completely fallen apart. not an everyday wear for sure. you get what you pay for."
2.0,"Super soft. kinda stretchy, but waaaaay too small. I ordered the XL. They are more like a small/medium."
2.0,Too thin and see-through. Cheap looking.
2.0,The white color rubs off and turns black very easily
2.0,"Nice wallet, but too hard to get my iPhone 6 in and out of. Also, only one main compartment no side pocket."
2.0,Didn't fit me
2.0,"Thin material, the waist falls lower than expected. I returned this and got a similar dress from a different company that was much better."
2.0,"I bought this coat as a gift for my husband.  When it arrived, I was shocked that this was just a thin windbreaker like rain coat with decals that look like iron ons.  With a price tag of over $200.00 I thought was going to get something more like a ski jacket. Honestly, I felt totally ripped off.  However, after  my husband opened the gift, he told me that all of these F1 racing items are way overpriced.  He was not at all surprised by the high price tag (unless he just acted that way because he felt bad).. Anyways the item is as described.  It is a very thin wind breaker.  Without the team logos, I would imagine that a jacket like this would cost around $30.00."
2.0,I had to send it back because it was too small.
2.0,I ordered xx came as large size. Once it's washed it will be kids clothes.
2.0,Cute. Nice fabric. However they need a draw string it something because it's very large and doesn't stay up
2.0,The material is cheap and it needs to be taped or pinned under the knees so they don't fall down.<br />It works if you mean to wear it only once like a generic cheap Halloween costume.
2.0,"Works OK. Elastic straps are the weak link - stretched out by third wearing. Nice looking blue plaid, though. Price point about 4x worth"
2.0,Spend your $30 on a different dress. This dress is see through and the material feels really crappy. I wanted to love this dress so much but I can‚Äôt. I really thought i was going to be getting a decent quality dress for 30 DOLLARS!!!
2.0,"The material is ok and the colors look just like the picture. However, it is an open back that you have to cross the straps yourself and put through a single loop (I think anyways). Was slightly confusing as it came in plain unmarked packaging and no direction as to how to do the backside of it properly. Plus is was way too big for my 6 month old. Returning."
2.0,Poorly made. The coating chipped off on day 2 and it was very difficult to put on.
2.0,Thought it was leather üòû
2.0,"Liked the ring design liked the stone size but did not like the stone, a teeny tiny sliver of fire on one edge tge rest brown!!!!! Not as depicted online, contacted company they responded that &#34;fire opal&#34; is like that!<br />I didnt buy a fire opal I thought i was purchasing a Mexican fire agate!!!!! as shown Returning it. Two stars one for the design one for stone size minus five for saying it was a Fire Agate when it wasnt!!!"
2.0,"Plus: strong material; looks like it won‚Äôt run easily. Con:<br />They kept falling down around my ankles, either because their elastic is not strong enough or they‚Äôre too short or they‚Äôre not good for women who have non-twig-like calves. Ended up giving the remaining packages away."
2.0,Very pretty but the points are sharp and dig into my ear causing a sores.
2.0,This dress is huge. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3 and weigh 165 lbs. I ordered a small and the dress is large on me. The top portion of the dress does not have an umpire waist. The waist band hits below my belly button and fits very loose. The sleeves are loose and extra long (and I have thick arms). Super bummed because I was excited about this simple classic style.
2.0,"This bracelet is beautiful! Exactly as shown in the picture. However, even though I ordered the largest size it is still very small! It is the size of a pre-teen bracelet. Ive added pictures to show. I do not have large hands at all and I couldn't even fit it over my knuckles and fingers to get into my wrist. I'm under the impression that even if I did get it into my wrist that it would fit snuggly, not loose like a bangle should."
2.0,I ordered a medium for my husband and what arrived looked like xxs and definitely will not fit him.
2.0,"I guess the price did serve to warn about quality, but these were quite disappointing. Too transparent and the shape is odd."
2.0,"I love the glasses, but the plastic frame has an awful smell, and after wearing them for about 30 mins, the smell makes me nauseous."
2.0,I wasnt expecting greatness for disposable party masks for $5.95 but they arrived creased/scratched. Also much smaller than expected. I returned them. I dont think theyre worth the price at all.
2.0,"I got this pant and the Coyote Brown at the same time. This one was to short the pockets are not the same not as nice as the Coyote, The belt loops are very small hope they last more then 6 times I ware them. I do not like them. The Coyote Brown are nice They are OK I cant see what the color would do in the change of all that they did???"
2.0,This dress runs very large and is not made well.  The material is thin and rough.
2.0,Did not fit over my glasses
2.0,i couldn't connect the mask part too hard
2.0,"The shirt hung on me like a dress and if you have any back fat at all, this will show it for sure (because of the material). I am giving this to someone else who likes it, though. All is not lost."
2.0,"This dress is made very cheaply. I will keep it only because I hate sending things back, but it is terrible."
2.0,Opal rock came loose
2.0,"These have been worn twice and they are already falling apart, very disappointing."
2.0,These are weird! The fabric has so much static
2.0,looks cheesy in person.
2.0,"Pros: Really cute, perfect summer dress<br />Cons: Super small. I usually wear a medium in dresses, but I ordered a large based on reviews... This &#34;large&#34; dress was more like a small. Boo..."
2.0,Not very happy nothing like what picture is plus the hanging backs broke
2.0,The back ing earring want stay on.
2.0,Shrung alot when washed.  Not soft.  Okat fit before it was washed
2.0,Beautiful vest but zipper is very poor quality. Cant even zip and beware cant unzip once zipped!!!
2.0,"Dropped relatively 2-3 ft, cracked the screen.  This is NOT hard rubber, it is thin rubber."
2.0,very danty. Broke on second wearing.
2.0,"Size is accurate which is why 2 stars. Shipping was slow but mail time is slow now since covid. Poor quality, for it looks like something you would buy at dollar general."
2.0,Hoop was too small. Did not fit for my nose. Can hardly see the opal color
2.0,Very cute but was falling apart after one week of taking back and forth from preschool. Poor quality!!
2.0,"Fabric was too thin, not supportive."
2.0,I had a hard time telling the color of these in the picture but I figured the description of ‚Äúwhite‚Äù meant there would be some white on them. These are grey and beige lackluster hoops. Sizes are bigger than I thought they would be. MEH at best.
2.0,"Way too small. I wanted it to fit like the picture, but the body is more fitted and the neckline too high. I ordered a large, I'm 5'6&#34; average build around 140lbs. It was right enough the pockets showed. Maybe a 2xl would have done it. I returned it. Maybe I'll order a bigger one."
2.0,more for a large men's size
2.0,"I loved the look online, and the angle of the pictures makes the band look thicker, wider, and more durable than what I received. While removing the extra links (which I love that they make it so easy with the extra clasps), the clasp that is not removable, attached to the chain itself, broke in half the first time I went to clasp it. Very disappointed that I didn't even get to wear it once before it broke. The second star is only for the ease of removing extra links."
2.0,"I thought I was getting an ivory colored flower.  Mine is yellow, very yellow.  Not loving it, and I bought two of them."
2.0,This product did not fit as expected the size ordered was not correct
2.0,"quality could have been better, it doesn't absorb much sweat"
2.0,I like the story‚Äôs a lot HOWEVER it‚Äôs very awkward to use the pocket. Also they don‚Äôt last very long. They‚Äôre already starting to fall apart.
2.0,"Top is okay but unusual material. Thick but slippery to touch..not sweatshirt material I was expecting. But, since I'll only wear for 1-2 days, during the season the price was right and I've decided to keep it!"
2.0,"Bought a men's medium, because the sleeves in the photo looked snug/well fitted. WRONG! I could have fit 4 of my arms in the sleeve. A bit of false advertising, unless the model is wearing an XS."
2.0,The watch face and the watch band are too small for an adult. It would be fine for a child.
2.0,The Red of the shirt and pants are a different shade so it does not look like a matching set. Looks like two different pieces thrown together. Quality seems good.
2.0,"The material is great. fits good for a broad guy. The feeling is nice. I know the shirts aren‚Äôt costly but I was hoping a few uses out of it. I hate to do two stars but it‚Äôs worth the fit. But, for some reason my shirt the material melted in the dryer after the second wash. My dryer is new and I use it all the time. Low heat. So I‚Äôm not sure why, just be careful with the material. I only got one good use out of it."
2.0,Too small In  chest
2.0,"if you're tall, don't get this bathing suit. Fits awkwardly in the bust area."
2.0,Very pretty but too short/right on neck and breaks easily.  Clasp is not steady either.
2.0,Shirt did not cover my midsection AT ALL. The middle of the front actually didn't even cover my belly button. Returned item!
2.0,The backing isn't stainless steel and my ear reacted so I gave them away
2.0,The dress is cute but deceptively not black and white but blue and white. Now I must return a cardigan I bought in black for one in blue. Quite an inconvenience
2.0,Came with the stone lying in the bottom of the box.  Otherwise quality seems fine. Unfortunately was unable to give it for a gift as it was broken.
2.0,It feels and looks great but the stitching on the inside started ripping the first day.
2.0,They changed color within a week.
2.0,My toddler loves the shoes but a unicorn fell off the first day. I glue gunned it back on. A week later the sole fell out. Super cute but poor quality.
2.0,This dress is sooooo poorly made. the off the should part is so awkwardly tight and the rest of the dress looks like it was made for someone whose body looks like a potato. Idk how to explain it. it has no shape like a pillow case and when you pull the shoulders down it doesn't look right.
2.0,"Nice idea, poor material. Because of the fabric, this dress CLINGS to everything! Looks like a walking ad for static cling. I simply cannot wear it anywhere, too bad.And no, a slip won't work!"
2.0,It was a little bigger than expected.
2.0,When on it looked weird and did not fit well. The material is nice though and it is very pretty.
2.0,Poorly made. Tail is just stuck on with glue. Thin sole. And poor stitching
2.0,"I give this 2 stars because if it were a foot shorter, it would be perfect. I'm 5'7&#34; and it goes to mid-shin on me. Don't by this if you're over 5' tall, you'll be wasting your money."
2.0,The product did not fit properly I ordered a small and tag said large and I had to wash it several time as it has some sort of uncomfortable feel until I wash it
2.0,Followed other reviews and ordered 2 sizes up. They fit in the waste but were baggy in the legs. The quality of the shorts is not good for the price. They look like shorts I can go get at Walmart for 10 bucks. Will be returning.
2.0,"The socks are nice ,but they are not plus-sized as the description states ."
2.0,Not as sturdy as I like them.
2.0,"When I bought this bag I tried it out before I left for vacation to be sure it would hold everything I needed for travel. The things I liked were it held my iPad Pro, great size, comfortable crossbody strap, good sized pockets on the outside, locking zippers and lightweight.<br />The reason I‚Äôm giving it only 2 stars is because it will not stand up on the flat bottom so you cannot set it on a chair, table... without it falling over. The other main reason for 2 stars is because after using it for 2 months on vacation in 2018 I got it out to use it for an upcoming vacation and looked at it and realized it looks quite worn. There is a place where the fabric is actually worn through. What a disappointment. I expected better from Travelon."
2.0,"I bought for 4th of July, in the heart of the summer. Dress is kind of insulted. There‚Äôs a type of fleece lining. I would die in July heat with this. Returning it."
2.0,"I have had this ring for 32 days and the silver is already wearing off, showing the copper color underneath. The stones are all still in place, but the ring in unwearable now. I didn't expect a lot for $15 but I certainly expected to be able to wear this for longer.<br /><br />The one perk of this ring being the stone are flush with the band. But I won't be purchasing this again."
2.0,"Cute shirt. Runs bigger than sizing chart. Very thin, shiny material. The red looks more orange than red."
2.0,"This necklace is not red or cherry colored, but the balls are alternately gold and brown colored beads. Nice if you like those colors, but I ordered a red necklace, so returned it. Otherwise, very nice beadwork."
2.0,"So, number one, it's a nice heavy feeling bag, which makes it feel like leather and of high quality. BUT... I just couldn't get past two problems.<br /><br />The edges of everything-- all the black lines along the edges of pretty much every single part of the purse-- are sticky. Not just a little tacky, but actually sticky enough that when I put my hand into the purse to feel the bottom, it stuck to my sweatshirt and followed my wrist until I unstuck myself. I also noticed a distinct chemical smell-- probably if I cared to keep the purse, I could air it out on a windowsill for a few days-- just something to note.<br /><br />Also, and equally annoying with the stickiness... the belt around the purse. It actually has a function, not just decoration. The ""buckle"" piece will slide (with great difficulty) along the belt, which tightens or loosens the amount of play all the way around the bag. This means that when you get the purse and open the box (nicely packaged by the way-- dust bag, tissue paper, even a roll of foam to keep the crease where the bag is folded in the box to a minimum).... you will see that the buckle is towards the side of the purse, not centered as it is in the photo. This keeps the belt taut around the bag and so it definitely restricts how wide open the top of the bag will open. SO, I thought, I'll just loosen up the belt a bit, I'll move the buckle to the center front and that will also allow me to open the bag ""mouth"" and fit a wallet, checkbook, etc in there without having to slide my skin/clothing against the sticky Venus fly trap edges.  UGHH nooooooo, because moving the buckle is a major pain, and once you have the buckle centered, the belt sags horrifically, because I think I mentioned, this is actually fairly heavy material, so you will end up with the buckle facing the floor, hanging even with the bottom edge of the bag, and it just looks awful. And because the ends of the belt are stitched to the back of the purse, so it's not even a complete circle of belt all around, you can't adjust or play with it to center the buckle but keep the belt taut. All in all it's just a nice try to imitate the original designer's bag, but fail on execution."
2.0,"Pros: The color is great<br />Cons: The material is noisy. It feels like you're wearing a parachute. It's too small, too. Go up 1 or 2 sizes. It seems like this is a Chinese mfgr. I'm usually Medium, and I went with Large and it seemed to be mostly OK. One of the biggest issues I had with it is that the buttons are so small. If there is even the smallest of tugging on them, they come unbuttoned easily. My shirt kept popping open at work. Maybe this is what you want at your job, but it did not go over well in my office."
2.0,Very awkward fit. I am 5'2 119 lbs. Hated that the wasit was elastic and sits at breast height. Would have been so much cuter without that. Will not be wearing ! Very disappointed
2.0,"Had a pair before and lost them.. Ordered these and they do not feel as comfortable as my previous pair.  They work and are compact, just wish they were like the old ones."
2.0,Very nice fabric and cut. I waited so long and now I can only wear it wide open. The model must be the size of a 5 year old.
2.0,"Material was decent and not too cheap looking. I wanted to be one of the lucky reviewers that got these to fit perfectly, but sadly that wasn't the case. I'm 5'3, 150, muscular calves. The boots fit my foot comfortably (true to size), but I struggled to pull the boots past my calves. By some miracle I finally got them up and the top of the boot hit about 2 inches above the knee. Couldn't wear these with any socks or over jeans for that matter - which is the reason why I purchased them. Returned."
2.0,"It looks cool, but it easily gets snagged and it causes runs. If you only plan to wear it a couple of times, it is ok. If you are planning on making it a repeat staple in your wardrobe, look elsewhere!"
2.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; with an athletic build and I ordered a large because I read that they run small, it was WAY too short in the front, like any type of movement and it would wiggle up and show my naughty bits. If you're short then go for it lol"
2.0,The item is sheer. Disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"These look nice but don‚Äôt keep your hands warm at all and the parts that are supposed to allow you to use your phone don‚Äôt really work. I had to take off the gloves to use my phone. I will most likely be returning, unfortunately."
2.0,"First off, the largest size runs very small. My son wears a size 10 shoe. These socks leave tight sock marks on his skin. He gave me the pink socks. My women‚Äôs size 7 feet are really snug too.  The yellow socks are mental. You can‚Äôt read Oakley on the sock. They just look like a cat with bright pee stained them. These are not comfortable at all. I‚Äôve had worse. 1-10 scale with 10 being good, I‚Äôd give these a 3 for comfort. Value: 2 Looks: 3."
2.0,It was cheap flimsy material. It did nothing for me
2.0,Shorter than expected. I gave it to my daughter.
2.0,Too big getting rid of the 4x and changing the tags
2.0,Not worth anything
2.0,"Looks tan not champagne. Funny fit, fabric seems cheap and doesn't lay right."
2.0,"Not the best value, very thin, just a step up from a solo cup."
2.0,Love the color but no flexibility.
2.0,"Was way too big, but it Will be perfect for pregnancy one day I guess."
2.0,Ordered this dress for my sister and I'm not too impressed. The color is off and the style isn't as described. My sister unfortunately hasn't tried it on yet but I'm thinking of just returning it before I give it to her. Plus the chain around the neck is uncomfortable.
2.0,"I bought this ear cuff for $9.95 before it turned to $15.95. It's just a plain super thin cuff. If it's not worth the $9.95, it's definitely not worth the $15.95."
2.0,Way way way to small I ordered a large and wear a size 10 in jeans and they wouldn‚Äôt go past my thighs. So disappointed.
2.0,"I never received any info about the online access to resize photos & also did not receive an adhesive cover or sealing strip! I tried hot glue but it shows. Elmers glue‚Ä¶forget it! That was a mess! Finally used super glue that seemed to work, but was a pain trying to figure that out. It‚Äôs cute once it did work, but not happy it didn‚Äôt come with the things it said in the description."
2.0,"The earrings were beautiful.  However, I was unable to wear them to the event that I purchased them for.  The metal stud broke just as I was putting it in my ear.  I would caution anyone who purchases these, to check them over before your event.  I really wished I could have worn them."
2.0,"Although these tags look really nice, they aren't durable enough for checked luggage. I put these on my luggage as soon as they arrived. I travel a lot for work. After my first flight of the week, the tag was bent in half. After my second flight of the week, it was bent in another angle. By the time I got home it looked like someone balled it up like a piece of paper. I would recommend this for carry on luggage only. The metal is too soft for anything else."
2.0,This is a very pretty ring and looks just like the picture but it is not sterling silver. The first night of wearing it my finger turned green and it had just gotten worse since. Also I would say if your finger is a size 5 or smaller this ring won‚Äôt fit even if you squeeze it to make it smaller. very disappointed in this purchase.
2.0,Can‚Äôt see well. Touches my eye lashes.
2.0,Way to loose keep falling off. Unable to adjust. Skip this one
2.0,I bought this for my husband.  It is very solid and well made - he loves it!<br /><br />I am editing this review - changing it from 5 stars to 2. My husband just put it on his kilt for the first time for a St. Patrick's day parade.  The pin is just below halfway down the brooch.  This causes the brooch to tip forward quite a bit from the top.  It doesn't sit flat on the kilt.  I am going to have to sew it to the kilt around the flower part of the thistle so that it looks good.  The manufacturer needs to move the pin to the top half of the brooch.
2.0,Wallet too big for regular back pocket.
2.0,This shirt does not stretch AT ALL and it was smaller than expected. The arms were very tight as was the rest of the shirt.
2.0,They are cute but are heavy and they dangle a bit below the earlobe instead of sitting on the earlobe
2.0,"These start out amazing. After a couple weeks of constant usage, the clasp don't hold onto the material and keep slipping. For the price you would expect a much longer use."
2.0,My only problem with this tankini top was that the clasp for the strap was not sewed in correctly and you cannot adjust the one side. Rather than go through the hassle of returning it I'm just going to fix it  but I was really disappointed.
2.0,"I have a small head and this was pretty tight. The headphones in this hat are not the best, you have to turn the volume up very high to listen to things. If you are in a high noise area, this means the sound WILL hurt your hearing/ears. There is a large battery pack on the right side which can hurt the ear, it is not comfortable at all. If you are in a very quiet area and need to keep the sound just to yourself, for a short amount of time- this works fine. All in all, I would not recommend it. I do dialysis sessions and thought this would be perfect but there is too much noise in a dialysis center. Childs headband headphones that plus in would do a better job for audio and comfort."
2.0,"Great price, but I didn't love the color and it was too small"
2.0,Okay....
2.0,"While it looks pretty, it does not stay tight to your face.  It doesn't have a nose piece, and the whole thing has elastic around it.  While holding it open, it reminded me of the shape of a diaper with all of the elastic.  The rhinestones weigh it down, so without the nose piece it doesn't stay up.  And it is very small.  I have a small face and it barely covers the front of my chin."
2.0,"looked like they might not actually be vans, but can't be sure. They ran very big! Will save them for him to grow into as it is often more difficult to return products"
2.0,Charm seems fine...chain is very poor quality...definitely nothing like the picture makes it seem...I already have a locket and was ordering it for the chain because it looked good in the pic...don't recommend it if you are getting it for the chain...I don't believe it is actually sterling.
2.0,Thought this was going to be big and it wasn't üòî
2.0,ordered an 18g and it won't even go into my nose
2.0,The wire came off super easy. Not the lart that is supposed to detach it broke qhere its not supposed to come apart. It broke right when we were leaving to go trick or treating so my son had to wear it with no lights which was sort of pointless. Its to bad because he was psyched to use it.
2.0,I ordered a 9-10 for my 8 year old and got a shirt that could fit my 4 year old.
2.0,Cheap & clingy weird fit. Not at all as nice as the photos. Also runs small.
2.0,This dress fit like a knight shirt. It had little shape and the material was very thin. It wasn't very expensive but I wouldn't recommend this product.
2.0,"I ordered 4 bags of 40 finger lights and 39 of them did not work.  Great price and quick delivery!  The ones that did work were good.  I purchased these for trick or treat bags.  I was glad I only had 120 trick or treaters, because I would of been short.  I was glad I tested them all before putting them in the bag."
2.0,Is nice is nothing to do with the picture or linen at all
2.0,"The buckle broke off in mine like a week in. I'll buy a metal buckle next time. The brown belt still ok, it's harder to clip down then the black one for some reason."
2.0,Its a lil small
2.0,I wear a women's size 13 medium and these are extremely large on me. They are a little tighter in calf only. The compression is very very moderate.
2.0,Didn't fit at all. Way too tight for a large.
2.0,It‚Äôs just not like the old ones. This one doesn‚Äôt have tummy support. The band is weirdly at the top of the tummy compressing lower tummy. Seller said to contact them if you have complains but never heard from them for weeks. I bought three and I‚Äôm returning them all.
2.0,Not at all soft. It is big for active headwear.
2.0,"The watch have multiple scratches probably of an screwdriver. they only replace the old watch band, the watch looks good but it feels so cheaper for the price"
2.0,This product fits well but the material has a dye flaw in it that runs the lengths of the right thigh and on the backside of the pant.
2.0,Nice dress but the sizing was very small and it did not fit.  Easily returned to a Kohl's store for Amazon Return and quickly received a refund.
2.0,pouch is way to Smallville not hold you in placr
2.0,"I usually wear a size medium in USA sizes, I ordered a 3XL based on sizes hoping it would be a little baggy, and it is still too small. Due to a stretchy waist band I can still wear.<br /> The Obi (sash) in the picture is short... for it to hang down the leg like the picture, you would have to let it hang from one belt loop."
2.0,The dress is sheer so underwear or bra will show The sleeves are not connected and are very long. I‚Äôm 5ft tall and the dress reaches mid thigh maybe a little lower
2.0,"I am 5'10 and normally wear a 12 dress/blouse. I ordered an XL and wow, what an odd cut. The fabric was beautiful and high quality, the top fit perfectly across the bust and shoulders, the tuck looked very pretty and draped nicely‚Äîand then things went really off the rails. The blouse did not even come to the top of my trousers, which were basic Old Navy pixie ankle pants, not low-rise or anything weird. There was about a 1-2"" gap between the hem of the blouse and the waistband of my pants. I get that this is a hi-low design, but I wasn't expecting the front to be a crop top. Either I got a faulty top or the design is not suitable for tall women. Returned, unfortunately, because I loved the color and style...just not a fan of an exposed tummy at work."
2.0,"The material is very stiff and, when combined with the tightness around the neck, is uncomfortable and unpleasant to wear.  It does not soften up with washing.  I wish I had sent them back."
2.0,I love the shirt but it arrived with many permanent stains. Some look like rust. Havent washed it yet. A little disappointed it is new there should be nothing on it. There was about 7 stains. I take size small but ordered a medium and it fits perfect with percect bagginess.
2.0,I ordered the medium and it was way too big
2.0,I loved the color but they were too heavy for my ears.
2.0,"Even though CDC states that neck gaiters are not good for Covid... it is better than the standard face masks if you have a big head.  Unfortunately, I guess I have too big of a head because the gaiter was still a little too tight.  Also, a bit too warm for the summer  in TX.  Its better than alternatives until I find a 3xl face mask."
2.0,"The sizing is not accurate, it was really tight on my daughter. If was very bad quality, ripped on the first use. I don‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,I was kinda disappointed I got a 2XL and it still didn't fit around me and I'm usually a XL. The material I didn't like it was very thin.
2.0,Looks really cheap. Something $2 worth.
2.0,I don't like how the sweater doesn't come to the top of the shoulders.  It stops right about the arms and I will have to wear a belt to pull it together.
2.0,The shoes run small I wear an 8 should've ordered an 81/2 .
2.0,Too much extra material on the top.  Not happy with it and not worth returning.  Wouldn't recommend the grey one.
2.0,"A friend recommended this brand to me, so I ordered this top.  When I opened the package, it was clear the top had been worn and it had a stain on the front and right elbow.  It had also been washed and discolored, like it had been in a load with darks.  Obviously I am returning it.  If I'd gotten a new shirt, I would have kept it.  It is a cute style."
2.0,"These pant fit me just fine, but the problem really is with the quality. It is very thin (although not see through) and not very soft. I suppose they would be fine if you were someone that only cared about the look, because comfort and quality are really lacking.<br /><br /> I will likely be returning these."
2.0,I have worn this band for about six months. The quality is a disappointment. The top of the leather strap has a dull paper-like finish. After only six months the edges are frayed and the band underside is severely cracked. Don‚Äôt be fooled about it being ‚Äúleather‚Äù.<br /><br />The band is not whole grain leather. It‚Äôs a thin laminate of skin melded to fabric in the middle and a spray-on rubber coating on the underside.
2.0,"I thought the picture looked like shorts and a shirt, but it's all one piece. Maybe I just didn't see, but that is my fault. My issue is that i looks like shorts, and it's pants. It throws the whole outfit off."
2.0,"I purchased this bag about 2 months ago and used it for the first time today, the zipper came off so I am disappointed."
2.0,Ordered 00 got some that were slightly smaller
2.0,"Gave this as a Christmas  gift and the zipper heads already broke off, so disappointed that they were plastic instead of metal"
2.0,"Hard to take apart. Smaller than i expected. Not comfortable. I tried them all different piercings,  I have 3, wasn't a fan of how they fit."
2.0,there gorgeous until you hand wash them for the  first time. They loose all there luster after one wash.
2.0,"it may have been my mistake to not read the tag for this tie, but i washed it as an ordinary white material and it turned yellow."
2.0,It is a little big. It is comfortable. I will not used it to go out . I am 5.2 it was too long for me
2.0,"This shirt is interesting. I didn‚Äôt realize it had built in shoulder pads. The pads are sewn in and not removable. I didn‚Äôt like the fit. The material is nice and so is the color, but overall I didn‚Äôt like the fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5, 150 lbs and ordered a medium."
2.0,"Cheap, fit well. Very low durability fabric started to wear and fray very fast. Bit sharp in the groin..."
2.0,Too small and doesn't grip.  Nice color.
2.0,"This is a cute little purse.  However, when I opened the package the hairclip accessory was already broken on one of them and neither of the two purses I ordered came with the bracelet shown.  The purse is good for my 2 year old niece.  But don't expect much regarding the extra accessories it comes with.  I bought this for a Christmas present.  If I had more time to return it for something else, I would.  Like I said, the purse itself is cute and my 2 yr old niece won't know the difference."
2.0,Was too big.  Needed to return it but time ran out.
2.0,"Seams on sides rub under armpits and make skin sore and raw. Fits small, I would normally wear a medium but ordered a large and it was still too small. Easy feeding access."
2.0,While I'm excited to use these and they look great. The description says three cubes were apart of the purchase. I only received the two large cubes and the bag they were placed in was ripped at the top. I am missing the third. I tried to contact the seller with no response yet. Still waiting.
2.0,"I order lots of wigs and this one is my least favorite, its very plastic like and hard to maintain."
2.0,Horrible fit! Misleading advertising photo. This IS NOT jeans! The look is a cheap looking pattern up close. This is nowhere near what I expected! I WOULD NOT recommend these pants.
2.0,The dress is cute' but my husband asked if I had a new nightgown followed by my 15 year old grandson asking the same thing. This says something about the silky fabric. I think this dress is relegated to wearing at home. Too bad it does fit well.
2.0,"Cette montre est tr√®s petite et l'attache n'est pas s√©curitaire, malheureusement elle est jolie mais je dois la retourner."
2.0,"I ordered a size L which according to the sizing chart, should have a waist between 28and 33 inches. This one was 24 inches, so it is unwearable. Very disappointing because the skirt was lovely otherwise"
2.0,One of the pairs broke within the first 2 weeks of use. Otherwise they would of been 5 stars.
2.0,Too many loose feathers and messy. I ordered one for under 20$ from another site and it is much better quality.
2.0,"My mom LOVED this gift last Mother's Day (May 2019). But already it's lost 3 rhinestones and the sodder has detached the locket from the chain. So, cheaply made and didn't hold up.  We loved the look and the whole idea but I wouldn't buy this one. She didn't wear it daily but does report frequent wear."
2.0,The color was unfortunately much paler than the picture and too close to my skin tone.
2.0,didn't work out well for me
2.0,"These glasses could be so much more. The actual frame is solid. Great fit to your face and accessories are easy to change out and functional, but the frames are absolute rubbish - so cheap that both pairs I bought scratched the first time I used them. How? I have no idea, but they did. I've worn glasses since I was a kid and this has never happened to me with rayban, oakley, warby, etc. These glasses are way overpriced for what you get. If they used comparable lenses to oakley or rayban, these would be solid glasses."
2.0,I thought since it was a KW mesh hat it'd be good. Well it wasn't the soft mesh I was thinking it'd have. The sides were bunched up around the ears and didn't fit right. To the donation center it went.
2.0,The embroidery was nice but the jacket looked very CHEAP
2.0,"The fabric is good quality, thick and soft. It's too large to be flattering if you have a defined waistline. The pockets are awkwardly located to give you a pouch. Wish I could return."
2.0,Small frame and lenses.
2.0,"The look and appearance of the quality of this shoe is nice.  Unfortunately, my son did not like this shoe at all.  The sole appears to be 3/4 to 1 inch or so, and he wasn't comfortable when trying them on.  He felt like he was walking with blocks tied to the shoe."
2.0,"This bra runs small, I'm usually 34C or 34D depending on the brand, bought an L and it's pretty tight. The straps are not adjustable either, so meh, not my favorite sports bra..."
2.0,For the 1st time I got wrong order so disappointed! I ordered watch with wing but I received butterfly Instead. ITs all good.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay tight and one second next to Velcro it‚Äôs ruined.
2.0,Fits WAAAYYY small. My suggestion? Buy two sizes large just to get the right size.
2.0,"Okay for a grammer school child, not for me. Owl much smaller than appears in photo."
2.0,"Bought to wear to work for our Valentine‚Äôs Day theme party, but it arrive two days late and was a bust. Also, the fabric is so rough and not flexible at all-very stiff and uncomfortable."
2.0,"I received this as a gift in a size medium, but it was way too big.  I bought a size small to see if that would fit better, but it did not.  I decided that it's the cut of the jacket.  It flairs out like a tent in the front instead of being cut closer to the body.  It was not flattering at all so I returned them both.  Other than the cut, it was nice."
2.0,"Larger than expected.  The the space between the front and the back is too wide, definitely does not look like I'm wearing gauges earrings."
2.0,Returned not liking it bulky and cheap looking.
2.0,I bought these for my 15 month old and on the second wear they broke! The string came right off!
2.0,I wore them once and looked like I was wearing someone else‚Äôs clothing. Can‚Äôt even sell in yard sale.
2.0,Does not fit to size
2.0,Nice looking sweater but I ordered a size up and it was still to small.
2.0,"I returned this dress sadly. I actually loved it and tried to come up with a way to make it work. Though I am quite large in the chest, this dress was still huge in the bust."
2.0,"I loved the patterns and they are super comfy but they are thin and the strings break fairly easily. They are made in China, not Korea, so that is deceitful. They even have Korean writing on the packaging, but these are NOT Korean masks.<br /><br />Update: I keep getting emails asking me to remove my review in exchange for a refund. Just so you know...<br /><br />I have been contacted by the seller daily for a couple of weeks offering me Amazon gift cards to remove my review or change it. Beware of any positive reviews on this product."
2.0,While the watch itself is beautifully crafted my wife bought me one less than a year ago and the minute hand has simply come unhinged and spins around inside the watch housing. The company only offers a 60 day warranty so even though I have had it for less than a year they refuse to replace it. They offered me a coupon for 40% off instead of standing by their product. I would not recommend this to anyone which is sad because it is a work of art. Sadly it is a nonfunctioning watch though.
2.0,Overall item is JUST OKAY.  Definitely don‚Äôt even walk on moist pavement never mind wearing them to water your lawn. Definitely not as comfortable as they make them seem and within 24hours the right sleepers front end and started to separate. The slippers I bought these to replace I had to keep so I have another pair to alternate these w throughout the day or night due to umcomfortability
2.0,First we got the watch and a black piece from the band weren‚Äôt even on. We exchanged it and the next we we got without a batyery
2.0,Product is decent but shipping was terrible. It was supposed to be two day shipping but ended up being two weeks which defeated my purpose in purchasing this to wear as a groomsman in my sisters wedding. Very disappointed
2.0,Color was dark brown and not as shown
2.0,Not the same item
2.0,The front is longer than the back... weird
2.0,nice style but material is cheap and felt gross
2.0,Snagged first time I wore it- not sure if it was my fault or it was faulty somehow.
2.0,"Purchased an XL.  I'm a true size 16, and it fits as expected.  It could be a bit looser to get the draping effect like the picture, but overall I'm happy with it.  Unfortunately, as some other reviews have noted, it has this weird sharp point on the left side.  A little bit of an inconvenience, but I will take it to my seamstress to have her fix it.  I also wish the slit was a bit longer.  I may have that done too. Quality of fabric is nice.  But I wouldn't order it again, I feel like I may be able to find something similar from one of the many &#34;cheapy stores&#34; all around town."
2.0,Un poco peque√±os
2.0,i washed the outfit before I put it on my daughter a and it faded so bad
2.0,"The packaging of these socks declares ""New IMPROVED Design"".<br />These socks are substantially tighter around my calves than the 'old' design. New out of the bag, this is very noticeable. So unfortunately, they are too painful for me to wear and have been relegated to the rag bin.<br />Perhaps the ""new improved design"" is for people with really skinny legs like Popeye's girlfriend Olive Oil.<br />So, if anyone at Wigwam reads this and cares, please bring back the 'old' design."
2.0,"This review is for the ZSHUJUN Women's Vintage Puffy Swing Dress A2458 in ""Lanhua"" print.<br /><br />This print is a beautiful navy with pastel pink flowers and light turquoise leaves, exactly as shown in the photos. It looks most flattering when paired with a belt.<br /><br />I'm 5'4"", 110 lb, 32A-25-34, women's size 0/2/XS out in the world, and I got this dress in a size Small. It fits like a standard women's XS should fit, so you will likely want to go up one size. The hem hits at my knees, which isn't the most flattering on me (looks really ""1950s housewife"" length), so I would need to hem it an inch or two.<br /><br />That's really where the upsides end, unfortunately.<br /><br />The fabric is thin, cheap, threadbare, and on the verge of pillballing instantly. It's about what you'd expect from polyester Asian clothes available on Amazon, and probably won't last long. If it stretches out a lot, it gets kind of sheer. Because the fabric is stretchy, I was surprised to see (after I put the dress on over my head) that there's a zipper on the left side of the bodice.<br /><br />The main downside, though, is that the dress I received smells terrible, like Lemon Pine-Sol. I'm not sure if it will wash out. Hopefully the dress others receive doesn't have this same smell.<br /><br />I think they are asking way too much for this dress (at the time of writing, $27), given the really cruddy quality of the fabric. It honestly shouldn't be more than about $12."
2.0,Did not like this ring its cheap and way to big
2.0,"I really liked the look of this shirt on Amazon, sadly mine was just balled up and thrown into a bag, it was super wrinkled and wet (what‚Äôs up with that?). The shirts cute enough I suppose, but the quality was also lacking. You can find a better made (and similar) shirt at Old Navy or H&M. Also it runs small, order a size up."
2.0,Runs small ...
2.0,More suitable for teenagers.
2.0,"I am 5'11&#34; 185lbs with a body builder/athletic build and thought a sweatshirt with &#34;athletic&#34; in the name would fit me well. I was mistaken.  This sweatshirt fits me so bizarrely, it seems borderline defective. I followed the advice of fellow consumers and purchased a size smaller than I typically would, a medium instead of large.<br /><br />The body of the sweatshirt barely reaches the waist of my pants- and I don't sag my pants- the chest fits fine and the arms length is appropriate but they are baggy almost to the point of being goofy.  I showed my wife and she started cracking up, saying it looked like it was made for Tyrion Lannister.  I'm assuming that because I have a fairly broad back and bulky shoulders that it makes the body pull up short of my waist- its a frequent problem I have with shirts- but I have no idea what's going on with the arms, and because the arms are so big already I think a large would just be silly.  The material is very nice and just the right weight, and the color looks great. If it fit me properly I would probably wear this sweatshirt until it fell apart, and then buy another one.<br /><br />Thankfully Amazon issued me a no-hassle full return payment and actually let me keep the sweatshirt, I'm guessing because the cost of return shipping and processing isn't worth the value of a no longer &#34;new&#34; sweatshirt.  It's a nice gesture, and although I wouldn't wear it out in public, I may be able to enlist it as a &#34;bumming around the house&#34; sweatshirt."
2.0,Not that great and did not fit well.
2.0,I loved the length before I washed and dried them. They shrank a lot. So buy in a larger size to account for shrinking.
2.0,After about 3 wears the flip part starts to unloosen..
2.0,This is more a review of the material band than the band itself.  I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear rubber watch bands.  The band that cones with my Fitbit Versa is okay and I have no problem wearing it.  After I put on this band within a minute the skin under the band broke out in a rash.  It also is a little stiff.  I wanted to like the band but can‚Äôt wear it
2.0,I liked the band but it did not attach to the watch.  I tried to get it to click in place but I couldn't.  Also if you have a small wrist it is too big even at the smallest setting.  I am returning.
2.0,"A total waste of money. I am usually a medium but order a large to wear as a comfy bed shirt. It fits like a small, is very thin, and movement restricting. Into the donation pile it went."
2.0,The writing is SUPER SUPER tiny and when I finally got something to where I could read it parts are in English and some in Spanish??? Really?!?  Not a fan at all and a waste of money.
2.0,I was trying to find lightweight glasses that didn't make any marks on your nose and from the reviews I thought this was it-but no they are not. They make marks on your nose and they are very flimsy and lightweight. I would not recomment.
2.0,The chest was too small. I am a 40DD and ordered a 2x
2.0,It's a nice blouse.  Compliments my curves.  I biceps are bigger so the arms tend rise up a lot.
2.0,when I received the top the only thing that showed me that it was the same top was the print and color. Nothing else was the same from the length and fit . The fit is nothing like the picture it is much shorter and boxy.
2.0,These are very large and distort the image.
2.0,"Cute but arrived broken, luckily I have the tools to fix it. Good item for the money."
2.0,They were much larger than I expected...
2.0,Unfortunately one of the arms came off these after only a month.
2.0,"Its nice, but the material is all hand wash an it just hangs on me i am 5‚Äô5 an 115lbs i should of gotten a small size"
2.0,Wrong charm
2.0,Its acrylic.
2.0,"It should clearly say for kids. Had to give these to my younger brother, they were meant for my boyfriend"
2.0,These were too small and the button came off after one wear.
2.0,I ordered an XL and it would be closer to a medium.  The quality is very good and the color is great.  The sizing is WAY off.  These pants are useless to me because of the sizing.
2.0,Material is decent but runs small.
2.0,Suggest getting one size bigger than your shoe size
2.0,"the skirt fit tts. i just can't bear to wear it because it feels soooo cheap and scratchy. i guess i'd expect to wear something like this if i was in a production of Grease and this was just my costume; but as real clothes? no, girl."
2.0,"Pretty color and it fit well but not made well. Tried it on and the seam on the bodice is already splitting. It does get two stars for the fit and color and because I can repair the seam myself. Still, if you aren't handy with a sewing needle... beware."
2.0,It came all crunched up in a bag..it did not go back to shape. It was not comfortable.  Too big..I couldn't get it to adjust right. It kept hitting the back of my collar..I just wasn't happy with the style and how it felt. The material and color was very nice..Sad that it didn't work for me. I had to return it.
2.0,You can see through these pants
2.0,This shrug looks good but the quality just isn't there. It fits more like a 16/18. One little tug and the stitching busted while trying it on for the first time.
2.0,Priced way to high for  the quality<br />Very small. Not as nice as pictured.
2.0,These are cut small and are not 88 % polyester and 12 % spandex.
2.0,This is my 3rd order of the kid size masks (not because of lack of durability but because my son loses them and also like to have extras just in case).<br />This batch seemed bigger when I first unpackaged them. Compared them to the other masks I‚Äôve ordered and yup definitely bigger which was disappointing because the previous 2 orders fit PERFECTLY. Also noticed that some are slightly bigger and some are just too big for my 6 year old to wear so basically paid the price of 5 masks but can only use 2 that fit right.
2.0,"I have a small build and a small is usually my size. A small in this is a little tight - which is fine, that's what I wanted - but my normal movement has literally torn the material in numerous spots after one wear. I'm not moving like crazy, these are normal movements and the shirt is essentially falling apart and I've only worn it once. Don't waste your money."
2.0,Such a beautiful dress but it fit funny so I sent it back
2.0,"The wrist band is perfect which is the most important part, however the lock pins in this kit are way to small. The band doesn‚Äôt stay connected. Picture: left is original, right is what‚Äôs in the kit."
2.0,"This product disappointed me. It fits quite small and I had a hard time getting it on my head (which I never thought I had a big head). However, it's exactly like the photo. Shipping came quickly."
2.0,"Cool and comfortable, but not very supportive. Made with very thin light weight fabric."
2.0,"I love Gowntown dresses and I usually opt for the fit and flare style. By looking at the pic, I thought this would be somewhat of a flare, but it's more fitted. It was unforgiving as it showed every bulge, etc. I've never had that issue before. If you are hippy like me (size 20) you want to stick with traditional fit and flare. Sorry to say this was a fail. However, I still love GT and have six dresses in my cart. I will just stick to what works for next time."
2.0,"It's ok, good enough for a small kid, but idt it's worth  $10.."
2.0,"Super tiny, bad quality."
2.0,"Product arrived earlier than promised and I was happy to have them. They heat up nicely but the gloves have an industrial smell I cannot tolerate. I‚Äôve washed them, hung them outside for days and still they reek with the smell which lingers on my hands. The seller was great about getting them to me early and in good condition but the product itself leaves a little bit to be desired. To sum up, this seller‚Äôs service was excellent, but don‚Äôt buy these gloves unless you like an industrial odor."
2.0,Not the same color as the picture.
2.0,It took forever to get here. Even with prime. It‚Äôs thinner that advertised. I‚Äôm waist 36 ordered a 40 and barely fits.
2.0,Peeled in a week.
2.0,"I did not think I had an especially big foot (shoe size 8), but these socks were snug and uncomfortable for me.<br />I even washed them thinking they would stretch a little, but not enough. I am going to donate them to Good Will."
2.0,Pouch was to big..
2.0,a combination of barely 16g and approximately 14 gauge piercings‚Ä¶ the captive ball ring was both broken and the ball fuzed to one side‚Ä¶ pretty much a waste of time
2.0,"The safety aspect is good but working in a lab and staring at a computer screen all day, I purchased these for the blue light protection. Unfortunately, these did not deliver on that. There is no blue light filter at all. The lens are just plastic lenses and they scratch very easily."
2.0,"Beautiful band that looks very sharp. However, the band keeps separating causing the entire Fitbit to  come off and drop. After a half dozen times of this, hubby decided to lose the band before he lost the Fitbit."
2.0,"I noticed immediately that it is not seamless. Both shoulders have seams. And all the edging has zigzag stitching and still frayed easily and with these threads coming through, my daughter would start picking and pulling them."
2.0,"The quality is nice and it feels nice but at least once a day the clasp on 1 side keeps popping off.  I have tried everything to prevent it, just a poor design I guess.  But one of these days it will pop off into something where I can't retrieve it."
2.0,I have owned this approximately two months and appears stretched out and old.
2.0,"Not cloth, nothing like description."
2.0,Top way to small to be with the dress. Pic makes it look nicer .
2.0,Although beautiful and fits as expected the blend of material makes this nearly unwearable as all under garments can be seen even with slip.  I ordered a size up to see if there would be a difference but stayed same.  You can even see outline of belly button on both sizes.  I was sad to have to  return.
2.0,hi I'm 5 foot and I had read the reviews where they said it was super short. I don't usually have that problem since I'm not tall. But it does run super short. If I bent over I would be showing things that I would not want the public to see. Definitely would have to wear leggings or something under it. Which did not have the effect I was hoping for. I ended up returning it
2.0,"It looks beautiful in the pictures, but the quality is so bad. It is paper thin. Super cheap quality."
2.0,"If you order, go down 2 sizes, I wear  medium and it needs to be extra small.8 There is no shape, and the back is sheer, which is fine since I wear tanks anyway, but would be nice to see the back of the shirts in a photo.  It's going back"
2.0,Doesn't look like pictures
2.0,Sad that they were huge for my 12 month year old . Its made for more like a 5 year old.
2.0,Unfortunately the green and gray sweater I ordered came in blue and tan.<br />The colors are ok but not what my niece wanted.
2.0,"Beautiful shoe, ran small and had to return."
2.0,These were much smaller than I expected and the material was scratchy.  They do not work as I had hoped.
2.0,"Im pretty small boned so this was not the issue - however, I clipped the anklet on (very cute btw!) and it snapped & broke within an hour.<br />The most I did in that hour was walk to the beach bar to get a drink, and lay down. =("
2.0,Not warm and inside of shoe gets wet if you walk through snow
2.0,Not really glittery. A picture of glitter. ü§£ also uncomfortable material. Took FOREVER to ship. Huge. Just not my favorite. Expensive compared to ones I actually wear and like for half the price. Don‚Äôt waste your $ on these.
2.0,Really long like a dress
2.0,"My daughter is very petite. She‚Äôs 5.5, 37 lbs and 43‚Äù. This suit was too tight in a 6! Also arm holes are very wide on sides. If I tried to size up I think it would be very revealing on sides. Will need to return."
2.0,"Not the color shown at all, the purple is more of a plum color. Doesn‚Äôt fit great either. If you buy I suggest just getting the black."
2.0,The anklet itself is super cute but will turn your skin green if you wear it too long! Not sure that the nail polish trick will work on this one
2.0,very thin material and poor construction
2.0,"I purchased these Yoga socks at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.  First I must tell you that the socks are cute, and they fit me well.  I really like the non-skid bottom which didn't entail a bunch of bumpy dots on the bottom.  These were actually comfortable to walk in, and were comfortable overall.  The toes fit nicely which was nice, since I have tried other brands where the toes were too short.  The only downfall, and unfortunately the most important thing for a pair of Yoga socks, is the fact that they won't stay on your feet during Yoga practice.  This actually created unsafe situation in most of the Yoga moves.  So, if you want a pair of socks, that are comfortable, that you can maybe wear around the house, these might be nice.  I would not recommend them for Yoga practice though."
2.0,"One sock the top rolled down, feeling like my circulation was being cut off. Not easy to take off. Used a Sock-Aid to get on. Not easy either."
2.0,Arrived quickly but were too small for my husband to wear.  They are also very thin material.<br />beware of low price.
2.0,too small/short. I'm 5'6 and it fit like a cropped sweater..
2.0,Extremely thin material - unlikely to provide substantial protection from the cold. Hole for eyes a bit narrow.
2.0,"The materials used are nice, so I have no complaints there; however, the top portion of the dress is cut too short, so it ends up causing the skirt to come up too high, which leads to a very unflattering look, if you're someone with hips/curves. It gets even worse in the wash. Sadly, I cannot recommend this item."
2.0,Way too dark for wearing while driving.
2.0,"Sizing is off, I normally wear a medium or aarge depending on company. I ordered a large so it would be a little loose for the summer. It fits like a smaller medium. I ordered a white shirt and it is very light pink. Returning it because it is just not what I wanted."
2.0,"Willing to give this a second try. Wasn't sure if I'd like the style... In person I enjoy it quite a bit! Main problem was my pair was smashed into itself (could be shipping, could be lack of quality control.. who knows?) Right arm bent and twisted.  Nose pad and are bent out of place. Top of frame is bent outwards some how... Returning and retrying. Will update"
2.0,They are really pretty but very delicate which doesn't work well for a six month old. My grand daughter wore the white one for pictures. Within an hour one of the flowers had fallen out. They seem to be made out of foam
2.0,"Too small for me, tight, can‚Äôt wear it to sleep as I had intended too"
2.0,The microfiber started falling off the moment I pulled out the suit from the bag!
2.0,"I ordered the brown pants and received a disgusting yellowy beige colored pair of pants that will never leave the house. I don't think they would be terrible, the fit seemed ok, but the weird color I received is aggravating."
2.0,I bought the first a summer event and as soon as I opened the package I instantly knew that the dumper was too small. Needless to say the event started off wrong at that point.
2.0,"These earrings were exactly what I was looking for and I was happy with them for about 5 months.  At the 5 month mark, though, they became tarnished - brown and old looking.  I tried cleaning them with silver polish, which seemed to work, but the tarnishing returned just a day later.  I will not buy this product again."
2.0,"These glasses constantly slip down my face. If I adjust the back to prevent that, they cause a sharp pain behind my ears. I hate them and they make life miserable. On top of that, they are big, bulky, and ugly as sin."
2.0,"I ordered the solid green in XL as a summer dress.  The fabric is 95% cotton and 5% spandex.  The color is pretty and the fabric nice.  However, the dress does seem to run a bit large and it's stretchy.  My main complaint is that it fits everywhere but the arm cutouts.  It's cut out too wide under the arm and the fabric flares out.  I'm going to try washing it in hot to try and get it to shrink down a bit."
2.0,The jewel/stone part was bigger than I expected. The backs were hard to get on and off.  They came in 2 little baggies and had to try and match up with the match.
2.0,I liked the designs on the rings but they don't really go on my fingers good. If i wash my hands or done anything with my hands the rings would come off.
2.0,"Maybe I got a defective one, but the gemstone was loose and made a rattling noise."
2.0,"Pretty skirt, but it is not ‚Äúmopping‚Äù at all.  It also runs really really small, and the color is way off.  I ordered the purple, and it‚Äôs closer to an eggplant than that pretty bright purple color.  Will be returning, unfortunately"
2.0,This really showed off every body flaw. Not a fan.
2.0,I've been disappointed by SheIn before and this time was no different. Obvious 2 inch hole in the seam at about the sternum
2.0,Love love these leggings wore them for the first time to the gym today. They‚Äôre so soft and for great. BUT I noticed when I got home they have a huge run in them in the crotch area.. after wearing them once. I‚Äôm super disappointed.
2.0,Beautiful piece but broke several days after purchase. The part that the key hangs from the cord is thin.
2.0,ok but too big
2.0,"You get what you pay for, these look cheap. Look better on the picture. I am not going to wear them."
2.0,"Great pants , fit comfy and are warm and water proof, however the zipper on the leg broke"
2.0,Sadly the material wasn‚Äôt soft so i had to return. Also ran big.
2.0,These are so much bigger than expected. They make me look like a weird bug. They are for someone with a big face.
2.0,Do not like the material.  For a hoodie it should of been something else.
2.0,Very light weight! Put wholes  in them the first time  he wore them! Super fun pattern though! Bought for  daughters wedding!
2.0,I want to like this but it is sooooo tight. I had to give to my 8 year old as it gave me a headache. :(
2.0,"I ordered two different styles of beach cover ups, the Z-white and the White4, and was completely disappointed with both of them, for the following reasons:<br />1. They're One Size (Fits All), but the White4 came labeled ""L"" on the bag and it was waaay too small through the shoulders and arms, and the Z-white came labeled ""M"" on the bag and fit much larger throughout than the White4 size L.<br />2. Both came with front tie closures, though neither are pictured with them. (Not a biggie, really, as I could simply cut the ties off.)<br />3. Both are pictured as almost floor length, but the Z-white barely came to my knees and the White4 came just below my knees. I'm 5'4"", so not model tall, and I expected duster length cover-ups, not bathrobe length.<br />4. I personally don't like the stretchy, cheap polyester lace material. I was hoping for a better quality lace (but I got what I paid for, I guess).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I will be returning both and will continue to look for a good quality cover-up that can be worn outside of the bathroom/bedroom."
2.0,Comfortable in the sole but these causes your heels to blister and always have to wear blister band aids whenever wear these. Too late to return so basically stuck with them
2.0,Wore these twice and they are already stretched out.
2.0,"Looks great, and my girlfriend loved it, however the working was backwards, which is kind of a mood killer. Guess you get what you pay for"
2.0,Tshirt type dress. Runs extremely small.
2.0,Was not able to use gave to sister fit horribly. We are DD girls and she was fall out horribly...
2.0,"Wanted to love these. Cute colors, soft, comfy, and the elastic seems like it'll hold up well; however, I am wearing them for only the second time right now and just noticed a hole in the toe. WHAAAT?? Gosh darn it, had high hopes for these."
2.0,Pretty shirt but it was a half size too small and the zipper gets off track easily.
2.0,Was perfect but I snagged it and it broke. It is so tiny there is no way to repair it.
2.0,Jersey knit material. Cute but far too big to be a XS.
2.0,Cute but too thin. Snags again everything
2.0,The lenses are paper thin.<br />The frames have rough edges from not shaping from the mold.
2.0,"The idea is good but the fact that the stay is around your thigh it actually doesnt stay throughout the day.  The band will gradually ride up your leg until it's in your crotch.  Stick with the ones that attach to your socks.  Also one of the fasteners came broke, but I fixed it.  Just way too uncomfortable."
2.0,Bigger and heavier than what it looks like in the picture. I wanted a small cute one. This is BIG and not cute at all.
2.0,Here is another item that I thought with thicker or heavier then it is also it is very very short.
2.0,Thick material ended up returning
2.0,"While these shoes look cool, the front rubber bumper is coming off of both shoes, and they weren't even a week old.  We have had Vans before and they held up great to the abuse my 7 year old puts them through, but not these.  I am really disappointed."
2.0,"You can't tell from the picture but this watch is HUGE !....while it's not heavy, it  is  unnecessarily  large.  Also, the dial  is prone to smudges like a phone...I  have to constantly wipe it off"
2.0,I got the biggest size available and it is snug and short. Could be comfortable if it was bigger.
2.0,the boots are very narrow and tight.
2.0,"Item wasnt clear on which size i was getting i needed thev16g but i got the 14g, even though it tells you on OR the other."
2.0,"Just got these, wore them for about 6 hours, lost one somewhere in Vermont. I will probably reorder, as I love them. However, will try to slide little rubber protector on them this time!! A suggestion for everyone!"
2.0,It‚Äôs a nice dress don‚Äôt get me wrong but it is not true to size
2.0,"While cute and sassy, order two sizes up if you have any type of chest!! This was extremely snug so I returned it."
2.0,I didn't receive the same necklace as advertised. The chain isn't twisted like in the photos and it's hard to clasp. Feels cheap.
2.0,I love the material but the zippers don‚Äôt stay up. It‚Äôs a little awkward to have the zipper wide open. I loved the first one I bought and thought it just had a faulty zipper.  I ordered two more‚Ä¶ none of the zippers stay up.
2.0,"Im bummed. The gray ones came with a snag in the leg you can 100% see through them the waist band is a little in the thick side for me(about a little over a inch) which makes them roll down as I walk. I was hoping the other reviews were wrong, But they are not. You can even see my legs in these. I wore them in Las Vegas with REALLLY long tops because I didnt want anyone to see my underwear. Don't wear a thong! just in case you bend over and your shirt lifts up. Man its like wearing nothing at all with how much you can see through them, To me these are more like a panty hose not a legging!!!! I guess ill just use these to layer with in the winter."
2.0,Its tight around the thighs and calfs
2.0,They feel great but my puppy got thru the thumb in a minute or so
2.0,My 5yr daughter was so excited for these only to end up in disappointment. They are pretty tight to get on and off which made her uncomfortable. The fabric is soft and we loved the designs but they are very thin. The description is off as well. Says they have a filter pocket but ours did not. I ended up returning them.
2.0,Cute but poorly made and too small
2.0,I'm just a bit disappointed that on the initial wash before wearing them the colors seem to not be as vibrant as before. That's dialsappointing.
2.0,I can not wear these.
2.0,The fit is actually fine even though they look tiny. I‚Äôm a 10.5 but they have a good stretch to them. The reason for the low rating is that one of the socks opened up two holes in them within 3 hours of the first wear. They are super thin and I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware.
2.0,"I bought two sizes, 14 and size 16. The size 14 is too small for my slim 12 YOD; I kept the size 16 for her. After a couple of machine washes, the color started to fade and messed up other washed clothes...be careful!"
2.0,Pretty glasses but stick wayyy off of my face I love big glasses these just didn't fit me right.
2.0,Lenses are polarized but...the frames came slightly bent and the top of one lens keeps popping out. Would have returned if it was worth the hassle. it sits in the glove compartment as an emergency spare.
2.0,"The length of the shirt barely meets my hips and if I raise my arms, it looks like a mid-drift. I am only 5‚Äô2‚Äù."
2.0,Pockets lost stitching after two wears so had to return.  Very warm though!
2.0,"What was I thinking ordering these?  The material is cheap and shiny, and the flare at the bottom made me think, ""clown pants"".  Not flattering, not well fitting and they are going back."
2.0,"The necklace was pretty, exactly as expected however part of the engraving was missing. It was noticeable so because of this, I returned for refund."
2.0,Too small .. about the size of my fingernail .
2.0,"It's better looking in the pictures. It's thin material, it's baggy in certain areas. Not what I was expecting, will probably wear around the house."
2.0,Great shirt it fits a bit big I got a medium buy a size smaller
2.0,When I received the fascinator it was crushed & the top was not attached. I had to glue it on!!! Due to deadline of party could not return! Very very disapppointrd!
2.0,Back sticks straight out and hits your hard hat
2.0,"I bought this swim suit for my mom and she said it was small and see thru, that you could see everything!!!!! So I bought her the green one and it looks way better and she liked how it fits, it runs small."
2.0,A little flimsy. Not as nice as others I've ordered. Did not ship on time. Took a week longer
2.0,"Beanie arrived before Christmas which was excellent. We were delighted also that it came from London. Unfortunately as far as the beanie itself, it doesn't really slouch as it was pictured. Hardly slouches at all.  Just wants to stand out in the back which makes rather comical and ridiculous looking. So no matter that it arrived before the date estimated and that we were impressed where it came from the most important was a disappointment. The beanie just wasn't what we hoped it would be."
2.0,I sent this hat back. Looks better in pictures.
2.0,Just one problem:  the hands are hard to see amongst all that hardware!
2.0,The dress is shorter than I expected.
2.0,Made from smelly plastic the horse showed up in a plastic bag and was bent very bad the foam on the inside does nothing to support the heavy plastic of the horse on to of the cam its self dented I have put it on a bust a d trying to get the wrinkles out. Double stick tape for wings is your best best keeping it on your head.
2.0,I love polka dots and tankini's and was hoping his would work bit it was more constricting than I hoped.  It didn't fit comfortably across the chest and it also didn't offer much support
2.0,"I purchased this shirt in the hopes that it would provide me with the same effects as my Three Wolf Moon Shirt. (AWESOME by the way) Rather than females swarming me, I had them slowly crawling away. Instead of feeling the power of the majestic wolves coursing through my blood, I felt weakened by the presence of the sloths on my thoracic cavity. This rating must be considered a two rather than a one only due to the fact that it is rather amusing and entertaining to see female shoppers instantly drop into a crouch and slowly drag themselves away from me. Other than that, this abomination has no other benefits. I did not pass GO, and I did not collect two hundred dollars."
2.0,closing doesn't hold. watch falls off
2.0,Just didn't like style or material.
2.0,"Ends were not secured and unraveled within the first few days. They are really cute, but the quality isn't there."
2.0,"I purchased a medium and it fits more like something that would be a large + but not quite an extra large. The material is &#34;plasticy&#34; and not soft looking like the picture. It looks super cute on the model, but it does not fit that way at all. I haven't worn it for these reasons, but due to the plastic like material, I can't imagine it will keep it's shape either. Not impressed unfortunately."
2.0,"Returning this item.  It is the size of a throw blanket.  Far too large for someone my size.If you are considering this item, double check the dimensions are what you were expecting.  I will now have to pay for the return shipping thus paying ~$7 for the experience of trying this scarf out."
2.0,"El bolso es muy grande a como se ve en la imagen, no me agrado mucho. Muy bonita la bolsa pero no para lo que lo necesitaba"
2.0,Runs a little small and the holes are just slits. Not nearly as cute as pictured.
2.0,"Love the look but, there's a empty space on the inside that digs into my finger a little bit."
2.0,Leggings ripped after wearing them three times and absolutely has zero tummy control.
2.0,These socks our very thin. I bought then as a gift gave them anyways but was not expecting them to be so thin.
2.0,Not cute. And flimsy material.
2.0,"These are super cute, but the lip balm falls out all the time. I have lost several. I wish it had a closure on it."
2.0,"I'm a little disappointed with the cardigan. The fabric is very thin, almost flimsy & the sweater doesn't fit right. I'm typically a size small but ordered a medium based on the reviews. The sweater is a good length but the arms are extremely tight. It is still wearable though just not a good fit."
2.0,"I was so excited to receive this dress, as it's advertised as a tunic, but on me, it looks like an over-sized house dress with ruffles.  I ordered a L & XL.  Let me say that this dress would be perfect for someone who is 5'8"" or taller, has a small upper body with a large lower body.  The overall shape of the dress is triangular.  I am 5'2"", 160 lbs, wear a 40 D bra and have more of an athletic build, and I was swimming in the L from the waist down with the top way too tight.  Not to mention, in my opinion, a ""Tunic"" could be worn as a short dress or as a long top, over jeans, for example.  The front of the dress - on my 5'2"" frame - hit me below the knees with the back hitting mid-calf.  It was not at all flattering on my body in any capacity."
2.0,I ordered this dress a size up and it was still too small.  I have missed the opportunity to return it and now I am stuck with a dress I can't wear.
2.0,Very cute dress.But waist is sewed in such a way that it lays funny. Top is slighty tight. I typically wear a medium and that's what I ordered; and I am small busted. Could wear a belt over waist line and that would cover the issue.....<br />Returning this dress.
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like the material nor did I like the fit. I‚Äôm not going to return it because it‚Äôs too much trouble but I‚Äôll give it to someone.
2.0,"This review covers two items.  I bought a large and medium because the suit didn't come in separates.  The prices were very reasonable, so that was okay.  The large was fine, but the medium top had a strap that wasn't sewn to the adjustment piece.  I could sew it on myself, but I shouldn't have to immediately repair something that was brand new."
2.0,Not rigid plastic. handle is foam-filled fabric. My child was disappointed.
2.0,It‚Äôs OK but not a whole lot better than just the old regular rings
2.0,Cheap overpriced not very bright for what you pay for.
2.0,The foot was so padded his foot would not fit in his cleats.
2.0,The layout of this dress is cute BUT it‚Äôs not made very well. The buttons part has gaps even if it fit loose or tight. I am 5 0 weight 175 order an xl because of the reviews but it‚Äôs definitely big. Have to alter the dress now! And it does have some stretch.
2.0,Great fit but they tend to Frey very easily only after about 3 weeks of use.
2.0,I wear a size 9 on my ring finger and this looks dumb as there is a huge space between the dino and the band.  Maybe work if you are a size 6.
2.0,The backs on these are absolute garbage. One wouldn't snap on at all to begin with and the rest fall off with the slightest pressure
2.0,"The necklace looks just like the picture image wise but it doesn't really glow. I have been trying for a long time to get it to glow but only a few specks glow. I took a picture of it and it's a bit hard to see because it didn't glow bright enough for my camera to pick up. The necklace was under a uv light for over 15 minutes the other picture is my wedding ring that cost only 25 or so for two to be made and it was under the if light for 30 seconds. If you just want a picture of the wolf it's not that bad of a buy, but if you want it to glow I wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,I was going to use the socks to protect my<br />bare feet.  I don't wear shoes every day so<br />my feet need to be covered by something.<br />I am confined to a wheelchair and I need something<br />comfortable on my feet.
2.0,"I've been buying Isotoners for years and always liked the fit. This pair was a bit loose and even at that a seam failed in just a couple of months after I received them, very disappointed, won't be buying this brand again!"
2.0,I am a very small under 5 feet person--weighing about 100 pounds--I can't wear this dress at all. They don't show how you have to wrap it somehow all around you--and maybe get the front to close at all.<br />It is for tiny sub teens who have not yet formed a shape.<br />It is pretty--rather like a frilly table cloth.
2.0,Didn't last 9 months before the paint started coming off. Not impressed.
2.0,"Although the site said that the xtra large would fit up to US size 7 and 5/8, it's nowhere near that size.  Giving it to someone with a smaller head."
2.0,"Looks good but it is difficult to open it, wouldn't recommend"
2.0,Demasiado peque√±a para ser una L .
2.0,"I ordered this shirt in an XL and when I tried it on, the fabric was very thin and the size was skimpy.  I do not like to wear clothing that is too snug, so I am not able to even wear this item."
2.0,Don't like the material and it's not oversized as expected
2.0,A bit too small for a large and the length is too short.  Picture shows full length to ground.
2.0,"1 color had a strong odor and all of them fit differently, not the same size at all, poor quality, disappointing for the money spent."
2.0,"I bought these for 10$, it lost the stones with in 2 days. I am very disappointed. Not worth price!!"
2.0,"They were fine for 2months, then one of the soles split. Ones that happened I could see how thin the soles are.  Will spend a bit more on a quality slipper."
2.0,"Had to return this, which was easy, thank you to the seller. This wallet is nice except for one huge flaw. The design of the card slots is difficult to place cards in and out of the slots. This is inconvenient when you're standing in line making a purchase, trying to struggle pulling or pushing the card in and out of the slot. I won't deal with that. Women need to demand better functionality in products the same way men do. You won't find a man's wallet with slots that are so difficult to use or they would throw the wallet away. If you decide to continue using this wallet with the faulty card slots, those slots will eventually loosen to the point that your cards will fall out. You'll have cards floating around in your purse because they fell out of the wallet. What if you're using this as a clutch? You will lose your driver's license or credit card on the street, what a nightmare that would be. I would like to purchase this wallet again if the card slot design is improved, but I wouldn't use it as a clutch because the card area is not enclosed. It's too risky."
2.0,The earring broken aftee first use
2.0,"This was sold as a mans medium. As shipped it fits an younger boy roughly between the ages of 6 - 10. The body is amazingly short. Unuseable.<br />After reviewing it for a moment, it took mere seconds to give to a new owner, a girl, who was suitable in size for this products dimensions. What a shame!"
2.0,"When I originally got the package, it looked like it had been opened before, even though it said it was new. When I got the watch out of its packaging, the actual watch part wasn't working, even though the sound was. The sound on the watch is understandable, but you have to listen to it ten times to be able to understand it. Customer service is horrible. I've sent a few emails to the company, asking them how to fix the watch part. The watch part finally started working after a week, but I still have not gotten a reply from the company. All in all, this would be worth $40 if it had a metal case instead of a cheap plastic one, and if it had better sound. I would only recommend buying this if you wanted an overpriced plastic replica that doesn't work."
2.0,These are way to small. Look like they are for a kids head.
2.0,It's a nice purse for the money. Maybe get rid of the the middle compartment and use the zipper on the purse instead a snap button.
2.0,"I ordered a 16 and they fit like a size 8. They are gorgeous but the size is not true to size. The tag even said 16 üò≠ I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 180lbs"
2.0,"If your going to get this product make sure you go up one or two sizes , they come small.<br />I had to return mine."
2.0,"Really cute,  it definitely runs too small."
2.0,Muy grande padi M y parec√≠a XL. La calidad bien
2.0,"I ordered what I thought was a mauve shirt, waited a really long time for delayed shipping, and got a bubblegum pink shirt with cheesy printing on it. It's not worth the hassle to ship back to wherever it came from (China?), so I just gave it to my daughter, who was fine with it."
2.0,"I bought this for my daughters birthday, I received it faster than I thought we would. I thought it was a great gift that was until the front hinge came apart the same day she got it."
2.0,They‚Äôre great but within the first washes start getting ruined/ look very worn out.
2.0,I like the support however the straps dig into my shoulders and caused pain. I‚Äôm returning the product.
2.0,These earrings arrived tarnished and a very small window of time to return. Would not recommend.
2.0,"This is cute, but it‚Äôs so so big on me. It‚Äôs a little itchy too."
2.0,"Cute dress, but zipper  busted the first time I wore it. Also, the material is very strange...manmade and plasticky."
2.0,Bigger than expected....
2.0,"Look to cheapy, sorry!"
2.0,Cheap and almost paper thin. Too plastic for my taste so I just threw them out.
2.0,They clips only open enough to fit a standard size key ring.<br /><br />The clips seem cheap and not what I was expecting.
2.0,These are very poorly made
2.0,not easy for markers
2.0,Band broke after a few days of wearing. Going to try to reset clasp but doubt it will last.
2.0,Product liked as pictured. Nice weight but did not lay flat. Kind of disappointed.
2.0,LOOKS CHEAP IN PERSON AND ITS HUGE!
2.0,It's very short and the bottom half is very sheer.
2.0,I would not buy these. The LED lights pretty much stopped working on day two. The girls took them to the park and the pink film is literally peeling off. They are unwearable now. I gave it two stars because I don't hate it. I like the design and the wings. But be warned: they will fall apart on you very quickly and are definitely not worth $20.
2.0,awkward fit
2.0,The fabric was too thin and see through but I generally liked the dress design but cheap fabric
2.0,"The product is sized smaller. The clothes felt too tight if I did any kind of movement.<br />I ultimately returned the shirt because the material was thin and of a poor, cheap quality. The shirt is not worth $30; it's not worth $15.  It's a $7.50 shirt you can wear for a season. After that, it will be threads."
2.0,"The paperwork is fake and despite the unsymmetrical cut of the stone, it was still pretty. The middle of the cut was crooked. It was clear, colorless and sparkled on the sides like an emerald is supposed to. The mold of the ring itself was a little off as well. lt‚Äôs a good buy if you don‚Äôt want to spend too much and want to avoid the silver/plated rings.  If the stone wasn‚Äôt a bit too big for my taste and the ring actually fit my finger, I may have kept it. After returning, the company sent a very distasteful email telling me that it is a budget ring and to go to Tiffany or Cartier. Thankfully Amazon handles the post-purchase issues because the actual seller is not professional or kind in regards to problems if they arise."
2.0,Kept sliding around and the flower on the ring fell off right away.
2.0,"For the majority of this boot's life, I mostly just walked in them, about 5 miles a day, 5 days a week as a bowling pinsetter mechanic. I didn't start to be really hard on them until 4 months ago when I became an elevator  mechanic. They never really broke in and they were pretty uncomfortable the entire time I owned them. The sole on right boot started to split as well as separate about 10-11 months in. The seam on the left toe deteriorated about 6 months in. See pics for details. Would not buy these again."
2.0,"I liked the color but the design is flawed.  You cannot flip the lens from one eye to the other without taking the glasses off.  It comes with a see-thru plastic case.  Most others, if not all others, didn't show a case was included.  I have returned the glasses for refund."
2.0,"Looked soft so bought it for my elderly mom who has sensitive skin.<br />but it's not, it's nubby, and very thin. The fabric, is not the quality I would have expected even at this price. I do not recommend this item."
2.0,Too small but able to refund
2.0,Looks like a ladies belt.
2.0,I like a lot of things about these waders but I wore them 1 time in the field and a seam on one of the pants legs ripped. I was in the middle of a field day so my right foot was wet and soggy for 6 hours. It was miserable. I'm disappointed in the material. Brand new waders shouldn't rip at the seam during their first use.
2.0,"In my opinion this is not a 'shapewear', only a crop top. Therefore I returned it."
2.0,"These don't wear well. After only a few washings (on Permanent Press cycle with cold water), the sticky dots on bottom are falling off. Poor quality."
2.0,"Honestly, I thought the quality was very cheap. it keeps coming undone when you fasten it to your wrist. Not pleased with this purchase"
2.0,The gold look doesn't last long. The strings fall apart after awhile. If you wear this daily it won't last. Overall it is below average because it will fall apart after a month of wearing on and off.
2.0,dress look nothing like picture when you put oi on
2.0,"The ring is of good quality, however, even though this says that is is 3/8 16g, it is not.  What i received is 18g and 5/8 for size.  I measured it and it is not the size that I ordered."
2.0,"Cute, but disappointing that they ran to small to fit my feet."
2.0,"I'm sorry to say that I have buyers remorse. The waist is so tight that it's like a corset. It hurts my back when I put it on. A lot. The bra does not cover enough area. Side boob should not be exposed in a sports bra. And where you would like control, in the thigh area, there is none. So, it's tighter everywhere than where it's supposed to be. I know that women want to be sucked in in the waist area but this I'm concerned will actually hurt my health. I don't even have a tricky body, so I'm very confused as to who/what the model was for this design. I'm sure this is a lovely company but I've bought much much higher quality workout pants at Walmart. I only wear these when I have a workout wardrobe emergency and I should stop."
2.0,Material is like Pjs.  The elastic in the waist don't accentuate the waist line. Make you look pregnant. I'm going to keep it to go sleep with it or sit in my back yard.Will never used it to go out
2.0,Nice quality sweater however it does NOT look like the picture. Picture shows a flowing type hem but  it's actually more of an old school sweater hem. Not as expected.
2.0,I read the product reviews and knew this was plastic but for the price for one bag I expected better quality. It may surprise me but don't see it lasting through my daughters several Halloween events.
2.0,"Disappointing.  Picture makes it look shapely, but it just looks like a sack when you put it on.  Also seems to have extra long sleeves"
2.0,"I bought this to wear during my 4-day trip to Lake Havasu over 4th of July weekend. At first, I got a couple compliments and was happy with how it looked. But by the end of my trip, all of the color on the top ball had completely come off!!!!! WHAT THE HECK?!?! Such a waste of money! I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was cute while it lasted..."
2.0,Picture looked like it was blown up on an old computer. The resolution is horrible. Do not recommend
2.0,"Very tight, very pretty, but made for kids, or of course all the skinny korean,and China women ,I have a normal size kneck 16""17"" and one of them I coupdnt even latch  the other just barely was latched, but so tight, and the 3rd one was ok , But if I wanted to buy 1 necklace I would do that ,U need to remember were u are selling your products AMERICA,"
2.0,"The scarf was pretty and warm, however, I returned it due to it not being sewn on one side and I noticed that it began to unravel the very first time I wore it, and it left fuzzies all over my shirt."
2.0,"Great at repelling rain, However the hook and loop tabs for the wrists came apart and ripped out leaving holes and no adjustment.<br />That was with normal wear and tear, I never pulled hard on them, They were barely stitched in."
2.0,"Oddly, cups too small, ribcage band too large. Also, bottoms much too small. Unfortunate proportions for this 5'5&#34;, 135-lb. 34DD, typically a size 8-10 (depending) top and 6-8 bottom."
2.0,Low quality fabric and will never feel the same as shown in pictures
2.0,The pants were the same measurement front and back.  the back should be higher than the front.
2.0,"Bathing suit fitted nothing as advertised. I tried on and the top part was too large, couldn't tie around my neck without it pulling. When I tried to pull up to tie it pulled the bottom area too tight.  Just wasn't the right fit in this design."
2.0,"Good fit but the light color is totally see through. Material is light so would be good in a hot office, but not the see through part."
2.0,I did not like the quality.  Two pairs has the thread coming out at the top.
2.0,"Top was a bit weird, low cut. To be completely honest is wasn‚Äôt terrible overall but it‚Äôs defiantly cheaply made and you can tell in this. It just looks inexpensive overall. I‚Äôm a larger gal, I‚Äôm a size 16 in pants and wear a large in most shirts. I wanted a bubbly fun dress, this wasn‚Äôt it. Ended up spending WAY more on a dress in a department store that was this style but it looks 110x better so it was worth it. This made me feel yucky. My husband also said it looked like cheap pajamas."
2.0,"I loved this watch, but after wearing it for around a month off and on, it broke. The wood that connects the watch face to the wooden chain band broke and I have little hope of being able to repair it. Soo sad, it really is a beautiful watch, but not durable at all as I had barely bumped it when it broke."
2.0,"I‚Äôve gotten some really cute earrings for pretty cheap, but these felt are below costume jewelry quality. Very thin and one sided quality"
2.0,Super cute item but I ordered these to use on my crocs and they didn‚Äôt have the backings.
2.0,Really cheap looking. Very large and disappointing
2.0,"This review is for my husband. He loved the Dickies EMT pants I found for him. He works hard. A.C. and home repairs. He's on his knees and impossible positions. He also carries a ton of tools so loves EMT pockets.<br />Unfortunately he decided he would &#34;save&#34; some money. He hasn't had these for a full 2 months and 3 out of 5 are already ripped in different areas. Also they are a tad snug in the hip compared to Dickies, but the crotch has only ripped out of one LOL.<br />These may be ok if you aren't a rough laborer. If you are save your money....like I tried to tell him ;)"
2.0,"I was pleasantly surprised upon opening this package. A bright shiny blue jacket fitting to the top of the thigh (I'm 5'10&#34; with medium length body), extremely lightweight but very warm in 5¬∞C if wearing sweater, hat and gloves, toggle hood, elasticized cuffs, classy zipper. I was hoping to not like it and save some money but I fell in love with it right away. It's now my go-to jacket. I followed advice in the reviews and ordered an XL even though I'm regularly a medium. Perfect fit and sleeves are nice and long. Includes pouch for storage.<br /><br />Was just out in the rain wearing this jacket it is 0% waterproof. My clothes were soaked underneath. Changing my rating from a 4 to a 2 for false advertising."
2.0,"Works fine under a dress or something, but these are super see through.  I have actually owned tights that are less see through than these are."
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute and soft. Exactly how it‚Äôs described when it comes to appearance. However it‚Äôs smelled so bad. I don‚Äôt know if I can get the smell out. When I opened it, it smelled like chemicals and Body odor. Completely disgusting. I‚Äôm guessing its the dye or whatever material they use. Just be warned"
2.0,They needed a little stretch to the material and could have been a bit better quality (some have ripped) but for the price and they were cotton so okay.
2.0,Didn't fit like the model.  Definitely need to size up.  Also was made of a very clingy material.
2.0,"Not flattering on me at all!<br />The bust flows into the swingy bottom like a maternity top & the cap sleeves are cut really short & narrow... I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 140 lbs, 36B & got the Medium. While it fits fine, it‚Äôs just yucky.<br />Blah off-white fabric with a brownish stripe in a dizzying pattern & 100% cotton - the thin, kinda coarse cotton that feels like it will wrinkle up after washing (I haven‚Äôt yet).<br />It‚Äôs flowy & fairly comfortable, but on me, it stops right at the bottom of my crotch where the widest part of my thighs show - I need either shorter or longer to look nice!<br />Tried to like it, but can‚Äôt.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope it‚Äôs Helpful!)"
2.0,I ordered these earings for prt of my Egyptian Halloween costume but unfortunately I was afraid to wear them. They are awesome earings but slightly heavy and the backs of the earings do not stay on. I put them on and instantly they both fell off so I was hesitant to wear them and unfortunately had to return. I tried using a different earing back and faced the same problem.
2.0,For the price I paid I though it would had been better quality
2.0,"sizing is much smaller than they said, sleeves are very short and it is extremely light weight"
2.0,"As soon as I put them on the first time the stitching tore. The first day I wore them to work, three of the tool holders ripped off the pants. They have potential with all the pockets, but definitely need to be made stronger."
2.0,Lovely style but the bone and ball are way too small and easily come out.
2.0,Arrived broken missing the screw for one side. Bummer.
2.0,Not what I ordered or expected to receive. They shoe a sizeable item in the photo with the right buckle and what I received was the wrong buckle and the length was included with the buckle size
2.0,"I do like the style and the feel of the material, but I feel the x-large 40-42 is really a large. They seem to run small. Will give them away or lose some weight."
2.0,"Recieved bra , it was perfect but 3 days after I bought it my thumb went through the lace in 1 small spot , three weeks later the lace ( which is half of the bra) is holy just from wearing it . I guess you get what you pay for"
2.0,I order the purple hat for with hopes that it would fit and look like the picture.  Well it is not yearly as big and it is too small to fit my head.  I will try to extend it but not really sure that will work.
2.0,"I just didn‚Äôt like it very much.  I thought the top was a little fuller than I thought, not really bright or vibrant."
2.0,"Beware, the quality is good, and fitting is nice, but the sewn in organza is super scratchy. You would have to wear something underneath of prevent the scratching but I can't see myself wearing another layer so.. amazon it goes."
2.0,Not very happy with these. I followed the sizing instructions and based on my height to have the pants stop below my ankle I should have bought the short which I did. Upon delivery and trying them on the pants are significantly shorter than advertised  and the elasticity of the material is also very poor. After putting them on for just a few minutes they were already stretched out and didnt want to stay up.
2.0,"I received it, put it on and 10 minutes later a piece of it had already fallen off. I can't find the missing piece and I hope my dog did not eat it. It was not assembled as it should have. I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"I wanted to love this sweater. It is SO comfortable and looks really nice. Unfortunately, the underarms became discolored after wearing it a couple of times. I am really disappointed because I love how it feels on."
2.0,Pads move. Makes breast look weird
2.0,"I‚Äôm a size 16, 38DD and the XL fit perfectly across the waist and chest but the arms were so tight that I ripped the shirt trying to get it off.  Also very low cut, definitely need a cami underneath.  Larger ladies, if you‚Äôve got toned guns it might be worth it - it‚Äôs very cute! - but otherwise don‚Äôt bother."
2.0,"This dress looks exactly like the picture and  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and found it to be a nice length. However, the material is extremely thin and looks cheap in person."
2.0,"I did not find this dress to be flattering at all. The shoulders were pretty wide and kind of pointy. I have enough curve that it should have filled out nicely, but it didn't."
2.0,Not stable. Does not clip strongly
2.0,"The sizes seem to vary in shipment.  Also, the leg seam rips with minimal pull."
2.0,No real padding.. Ouch
2.0,"as the headline says....<br /><br />been using it for a couple of weeks:<br />Pros:<br />- cheap<br />- light<br />- molded toe rubber (that was a feature i was looking for - apart of course from steel toe and puncture resistance)<br />- build quality seems reasonable ...but hard to say at this point<br /><br />Cons:<br />- no support in sole...too flexible like an Converse allstar type sole - so painful after some time<br />- built too small for wide for foot<br />- no real ankle support<br /><br />so in short - you can use this if you are looking for an all around low-medium duty work boot with steel toe and PR....but it is NOT one of those super sturdy work boots that you usually buy (eg Carharrt, Timberland etc)"
2.0,it's too small for me to judge the cut.
2.0,"I liked the heavy weight of this dress. The material is soft and has a silky feel. Unfortunately, this dress looked like a sack with wings on me. It was just overwhelming and seemed to be without a shape. It could be because I'm 5'3 and 180. The length was great for wearing sandals.  I should've ordered a size down to see if it made a difference."
2.0,Ordered these and what a disappointment.  At least half of them did not work.  And the half that did work had a hard time staying on.  Some of them would turn off on their own.  Waste of money.
2.0,The scarf is not satin like its stated. The scarf is 100% polyester.
2.0,It was smaller than it looked in the picture
2.0,Its a shame these do not last. My husband loved them. Super comfy. Super light. Super soft....super dead in 3 months
2.0,I dislike the fabric it's see through and the size for XL is really a M.
2.0,Would've been cute but way too small for an XL...
2.0,"It would have been a nice set, but the hat had an unknown orange stain on it. I tried washing it, several times, and it did not come out.  I would have returned it, but figured I couldn‚Äôt because I had already washed it."
2.0,Too short for older women.
2.0,"I ended up returning this sweatshirt immediately. After spending the same amount of money ($50) on my Carhartt hoodie sweatshirt which is warm, thick high-quality material ‚Äì this thin, crappy material yet still $50 north face sweatshirt seemed completely not worth it in comparison. I would expect more from North face since they are supposed to be well-versed in clothing meant for the outdoors. It honestly was the cheapest sweatshirt ... I might as well could have ordered it off of wish app smh."
2.0,The cards were too tight in the back and I had trouble getting them in and out of the case.  I bought something different and do not use this.
2.0,Not a sweater like I expected.
2.0,It was kind of cute for the price but the 1/2 inch metal connectors at the end bracelet that hold the strands together had rust spots.
2.0,Way too big.  Looked like a potato sack on my wife.  I will be returning.
2.0,very very cheap but pretty
2.0,"I liked that it came with free returns. One set had defective knots and rather exploded when tried to put them on. The other pair seemed just fine. Due to time constraints, I didn‚Äôt reorder to see if defect was a fluke."
2.0,Nice quality bug huge! I have a very normal sized head and it slipped right off. So not functional. It should be offered in sizes.
2.0,Disappointed! Nothing like the picture at all! Def go up a couple sizes than your normal so it doesn't fit too snug!
2.0,The sparkles come unglued from the shoe with her second time of wearing them.
2.0,"So I ordered this shirt a few days ago and I can say it arrived very quickly. HOWEVER,  I put it in the washer (on the gentle cycle) and when I took it out all of the letters (towards the bottom only...weird) had faded terribly. I didnt even put it in the dryer. For a $24.00 plus $6.00 shipping shirt I do expect better quality. I would not recommend spending the money unless you want the &#34;distressed&#34; look after the first washing. Very disappointed in this product. üëé"
2.0,"In picture, the earrings look dainty and small. When I received them, they're huge! Oh well :( not what i expected."
2.0,I dont like them
2.0,"These are too small for an adult even though it says it works.  The ears look like mouse ears on top of your head.  Unfortunately, I can't return now so money wasted."
2.0,A lot bigger than expected. Nice quality.
2.0,I really loved these because the designs were pretty and it was a great deal. But in a little over a month the design started to fall off.
2.0,"This organizer fits well into my purse and give me more pockets and dividers so I can keep things organized.  I am currently using it in a smaller handbag, but it does expand for when I want to use one of my larger purses.  UPDATE: After using this for several weeks I find that the pocket stitching is beginning to come apart where it runs down the center of each side. Also the organizer has no structure to it so that it now squishes down and I have to lift it up and open the center partition each time I try to put my wallet back into it.  I really can't recommend this product as it is too floppy and poorly constructed."
2.0,"They do their job, but all of them are not cotton. I like them, but I just dislike that not all of them are cotton."
2.0,Have had a couple of these and both have torn at the seams. Not very durable.
2.0,"These earrings are not at all elegant, like in the picture. They are small and flimsy. I planned on giving them as a gift, but I won't even keep them for myself now. They appear to be very cheaply made."
2.0,Beautiful but broke on first wear in two places.
2.0,This bag is very small and cute. I only wore it maybe three times before the strap broke. Save your money and time.
2.0,"I bought the purse because the stadium requires you to have a clear one. The first time I opened the purse, the bottom came loose from the frame. I had to keep the shoulder chain wrapped around it to prevent my items from falling out."
2.0,The beads are lovely actually but I can't wear this because of the bright fuchsia elastic it is made with. It makes it look like it for a child not an adult. If it had been strung with white I would have loved it.
2.0,fabric is  nice but so thin that you need to wear a slip so you don‚Äôt see thru it. Summer dress so to hot out for that.
2.0,Description says auto open and close. Does neither. Also seems a bit flimsy
2.0,Unfortunately they sent me the wrong color and some of the flower embroidery already looked like it could unravel. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and 200 lbs with some curves and I didn‚Äôt really like the way the dress fit on me. I might‚Äôve selected a size too big but even then I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of how it looked in person.
2.0,"Fabric was too thin and combined with the light color, the effect was too shear for me."
2.0,"First of all, these are great looking shorts. I bought them 1 size bigger based on reviews, and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />The problem is that they already ripped about an hour after I washed them for the first time! About a 10 inch long tear along the right back pocket as I was sitting down on a couch.<br />That's a shame because I love the look and feel of the shorts, but if they're going to last less than a week I can't recommend them.<br />1 star plus 1 for appearance"
2.0,The color isn't even close to the picture. Disappointing.
2.0,"The watch looks as pictured. However, the clasp hardly stayed closed. It isn‚Äôt durable at all. Worst of all, the metal started to unravel pulling at sweaters, etc. Would not recommend!"
2.0,"The top was fine, however the skirt was longer than pictured in the photo.  I would say the length of the skirt is more ankle length - extremely long. It would make walking very difficult.  Returned."
2.0,bought this for my son who wears medium/large shirts.  This was huge on him.  The pad doesn't sit near where it needs to be at.
2.0,"This item replaces one that the furniture movers broke. I could not find it anywhere else. I paid almost $30 for it. The used box has $12.99 on it that someone tried to mark out. If I could have bought this Olef  Cassini fish from anywhere else I  would have returned it. I do not think that this was a new item, perhaps sold as one. Even the box it came in was damaged."
2.0,Made of silky material that doesn‚Äôt stay up and fabric is too thin for protection.<br />Waste of money.
2.0,It was good at first. But the butterflies wore off pretty fast.
2.0,"When this product arrived, there was a small hole in the area that would have rested against my chest which I needed to repair with a sewing kit before use. To have to receive a damaged item that would have otherwise been a great purchase, was disappointing."
2.0,"This dress stinks...literally. I don‚Äôt know what kind of chemicals were used in the making of this dress, but I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out just walking by it. I‚Äôll be washing it in hopes it will help"
2.0,This was my mistake in ordering these joggers. They have an elastic band on the bottom.
2.0,"The neck opening is Not as big as pictured so it is a challenge to get it to stay ""Off Shoulder"". Also is not Sweatshirt material, more of a polyester feel.. I will probably wear it around the house."
2.0,Rings were WAY too small for my nose.  Other wise very cute
2.0,elastic band in middle does not cover over the girls Item will be returned.
2.0,"I ordered white and the top was completely sheer/see-through, and sizing runs small.  I normally wear a size 10 and purchase large in these boutique style tops, but the large was very clingy.  Returning for a larger size and different color."
2.0,"Well i dont like to write bad reviews just the good ones, but this one was for a gift, and my father just didn`t Like it, no because they look bad, just because it was uncomfotable to his foot, he was complaining that it bother his foot, the walking hurt the top of his foot. Well from all of this i just can said sorry about my spelling my main Language is Spanish.... trying to help buyers"
2.0,"It's only one size to fit, they need to make it for expesific sizes too."
2.0,These just don't fit right at all. Runs very small. The top bunches up and I'm constantly pulling at them. Uncomfortable
2.0,"Cheap metal caused infection, ball would fall off constantly on"
2.0,To tight around the leg & foot not soft.
2.0,Disappointed in the quality. Very cute outfit. A little larger than this size typically fits. Washed as per the instructions and hanged to dry. First time washing it there is a large hole in the seam of the skirt. My daughter is going to wear this for her first birthday and now it has a hole before it's even been worn!
2.0,"The cut of this sweater was just not very flattering on me. It does fit, but it definitely does not run baggy and oversized as it looks in the Amazon photos. It was a bit difficult to figure out which side was the front without a neck tag. Strangely, once I figured it out, the length seemed longer in the front than in the back, which is not how they portrayed it. I found the neck to be tight, and the cut of the shoulders to be boxy. I do like the waffle knit, and it's nice and thick, but the fabric is on the rougher side, not very soft. I will try to pass this along to my daughter, who is much thinner than me. If you do order this, I would for sure say size up if you are looking for a relaxed fit sweater."
2.0,Tight and VERY VERY thin!!!!!!  Paper thin.
2.0,Shipping times were an issue but my niece did like it once it finally showed up.
2.0,"Would be great if they were made to fit the human form. Mine came as 2/3 legs with length to spare & 1/3 body, fitting like I was Quasimodo."
2.0,The zipper is poor quality and keep a getting stuck
2.0,Wife ordered an XS and it is huge. She is 4'10 105 lbs. She gave it to friend who wears a large and it fit her perfect. Size way down.
2.0,I expect to receive a brand new authentic Addidas T-shirt. I Can‚Äôt understand why there is plastic melted onto this  T-shirt.
2.0,Huge and super plastic-y
2.0,The suit looks cool but the lights only work when squeezing the battery case.
2.0,"I bought these to wear to my husbands hockey games because it is so darn cold. But these are somewhat sheer, and not because they are too small, they fit fine."
2.0,did not know it was felt material
2.0,"These socks are just OK. They're attractive but the quality just isn't the best. After a few washings, they're very stretched out and now slip down under our foot in the shoe"
2.0,It‚Äôs really nice and sturdy and the box is cute. It smells so strong like tire rubber and so plan to wear it outside! The scarf is super cheap so I also switch it out!
2.0,"Loved the gray color, but don't need everyone seeing my underwear."
2.0,Tangles VERY EASILY.
2.0,Poor quality..poorly constructed...
2.0,These are not made for full figures. I ordered one size bigger than I wear and they are still extremely snug
2.0,Slightly disappointed
2.0,"My husband bought this as a surprise for me and while it is gorgeous, I can't wear it. We bought a ring sizer awhile ago and Husband ordered a seven and not sure how but they sent a five. Five isn't even a number on their list to order. So it's pretty but their sizing is way off."
2.0,Fell apart within the first week but cute non-the less
2.0,too small I usually wear a size large glove and there's just not enough room for me between the fingers so the glove doesn't fit snug there's extra space floating between my fingers these are probably meant for women hands or somebody with small hands like teenagers
2.0,"I wear size 6 clothes so I ordered a M in this zip jacket.  When received, I have never had such a small size M on.  I could barely tug on it enough to zip it.  Way too small.  I sent it back but haven't reordered another."
2.0,I am thin and this shirt is bulgy
2.0,sweater fit like a short box.
2.0,It‚Äôs really cute but snags easily so I have nothing but snags all over.
2.0,I was anxious for these to come in just to be disappointed when they came in as they are suppose to be 18&#34; not 16 !/2 :( Won't be buying these again.
2.0,"The white skirt is so SHEER! Almost completely unwearable without adding an underskirt. There is no lining. It fits tight in the waist so if you‚Äôre between sizes, go up to a bigger size. Falls nicely. Has a strange smell when taken out of packaging."
2.0,"I really like this cute angle wings heart necklace design. It's very cute and sparkling. I was very happy with it when I opened the box. But very disappointed when I put it on, it broke on the first wear where the connection between the wings and the chain. The necklace is make with very cheap material, very very disappointed. I gave 2 star for the design,but 0 stars for the material quality."
2.0,"these slippers are really cute and comfy looking but run way too small, I would've had to buy two sizes up to fit my son's feet properly."
2.0,Its basic and looks rather cheap to be honest.  Wouldn't actually wear it. Maybe as a costume?
2.0,"Super cute once it is properly fitted, but I would return this if I didn‚Äôt need something promptly. It works in a pinch and adjusts to fit a broad range of children.  Things to know:  1.) The suspender adjustment operates through a precarious tension mechanism.  It works once latched, but it falls apart and must be reassembled with each adjustment. 2.)  The bow tie stitching is poorly finished and was unraveling before the package was even  opened.  3.) The color is supposed to be bright red but was more of a burgundy red and is completely untrue to the photo used to market this product.  4.) Also, note the fading of red onto the packaging.  I wouldn‚Äôt pair this with anything that will sweat or become wet.  Your clothing could very well be ruined. 5.) If you plan to use this, do so with caution with young children.  I would never put this on a very young child due to the obvious choking hazards due to low quality of the hardware.  I‚Äôm more hands off with my children so this would be a no go for me in a home with anyone under 4 yrs old.  6.) Sizing and adjustments for each piece seem disproportionate to me, but human bodies vary widely, you might be able to make it work.  One could wear one but not the other I suppose..."
2.0,Returned. Made me dizzy.
2.0,"So i thought these would be smaller, and a lighter green. Theyre more emerald and fairly chunky. They also look pretty cheap. Its like those clip on earrings you had when you were five. I mean if its the look youre going for then theyre fine, but i was suuuper underwhelmed. Theyre fine. That‚Äôs it, just fine. Plus one of them wasnt even glued in correctly. It‚Äôs also prettyyy heavy so it‚Äôs definitely not for small piercing holes."
2.0,Would be dood for working out
2.0,They were cute for the price
2.0,"A little big, very scratchy fabric. Could be used as a swim top. Shoulder straps were to long, but not adjustable."
2.0,very short. crappy print quality. took ages to arrive. not very happy.
2.0,"This product was very short (I'm 5'8&#34;) and hit at an awkward place for me. if i was shorter and had smaller hips it would have been adorable. The fabric was as cute as in the photos, so that's a plus."
2.0,"The shoulders are very narrow, and I am not a wide-shouldered person."
2.0,Said it was a XXL obviously a M
2.0,The band was wider than the watch.
2.0,It tarnished very easily. But it was true to size. Maybe you could make it to where it does not turn you green or tarnish the ring so easy
2.0,Very thin ; too easy to break. But beautiful.
2.0,"The picture makes it seem like pants, but they are capris. Not what I wanted."
2.0,Both zippers came off the 2nd time I closed the bag.
2.0,I didn't like the feel of the material and the neck line is entirely too large.
2.0,These glasses are not as clear on a dismal day as my other pair that I own. They tend to make everything look like a yellow haze on all the coming vehicles windshields.
2.0,"Very cute ring, but it warped badly after wearing it several times. I have a similar sterling silver ring that I have worn almost every day for the past 10 years and it is still in its original round shape."
2.0,Es muy bonito el collar pero una noche me lo puse y se me olvido quit√°rmelo y una parte se descoloro. Jajja bueno a lo mejor por el precio .
2.0,"I really wanted to love these sunglassses, however, they are just too big for my face.  I'm not talking about the esthetics of the glasses because they are really cute.  What I am saying is that the bottom of the frames rest uncomfortably on my cheeks and I think I have pretty average cheeks.  I took a picture so you could see what I am talking about.  The glasses move up and down when I smile which just looks wierd.  I hope you have better luck than I did because they really are cute and appear to be well made.  The actual lenses do great in bright light so I may try to wear these only when I'm driving in the car.  Even though I received these at a discounted rate, I really wanted to give you my honest opinion and I hope this is helpful to you before you purchase."
2.0,A little disappointed in this purchase.  It is really a BRALETTE.  Runs on the small side and no support.  Does have a hook in the back not just pull over.  I don't think I would buy it again.  Looks ok.
2.0,This is way smaller than expected. I‚Äôd order up.
2.0,"The fabric is not what I was expecting.  Very slick, like a swimsuit."
2.0,Ran large and was heavier than I thought.
2.0,"Not fitted as in picture. Straight, sacky cut, low quality."
2.0,I used this as directed.  Did not stiffen my hat .  Applied several times and it worked somewhat but not as advertised.
2.0,I bought them in anticipation of a long airline flight.  They just do not work for me.
2.0,I bought the XL (which is the normal size I would buy) and looked like Joe Dirt in a half-shirt with my stomach showing.  Waste of $40 for me.  If you buy... go up at least 2 sizes - I end up giving mine to a girl that's a friend who is 'well' endowed but otherwise petite and she can only wear it to bed!!@
2.0,I wear large but ordered xl just to have a comfortable fit. Shirt was really tight around the chest area and way too tight around the arms (I had to cut the sleeves just to wear the shirt).
2.0,This suit would be perfect if it didn't have a built in bra and too much padding. I wear 36f/ddd and it smashes my boobs. You can't tell they are smashed the materialistic great sizing exact to the chart.
2.0,"This fits super weird and the pants are not a good material. The shirt is way too short, like for someone with a mini torso. The neckline is extremely high and uncomfortable and it's basically a crop top, but the width is really big. It's somehow too big and too small at the same time. Do not buy this if you have the proportions of a normal human being."
2.0,"they are getting pressed flat in short order,,,"
2.0,I am in my mid thirties. This made me look 12. Not flattering.
2.0,"I am 5'11 so ordering sweaters is always hit or miss. This sweater definitely hit at my waist, with no wiggle room for shrinking in the wash. It just looked very boxy on me. I returned it."
2.0,The choker is so cute and sexy but it didn‚Äôt fit.
2.0,Ordered a size up and they slide down my butt when I walk. Too tight on the thighs.
2.0,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM.  THE HARDWARE IS SILVER INSTEAD OF GOLD AND THE STONE IS ACTUALLY<br />LAVENDAR INSTEAD OF PURPLE.
2.0,These looked kinda cheap and ran really wide in an 11. Couldn‚Äôt keep them on comfortably w/o gripping my toes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and 145 lbs. . Returned them.
2.0,Nice for a kid or for Halloween or dress up or something. Not something I would actually wear for real. It is large too. Not dainty and small.
2.0,Reviews reflected that the sizes ran large so I took that into consideration... DON'T!!! Mine fits snugly when unzipped and WAY too tight when I do close it up. Looking to regift and forget!
2.0,"POOR QUALITY, AND LOOKS CHEAP.  THE ROSE GOLD WAS AN ORANGE COLOR.  THE STONES WERE WORSE."
2.0,"The stones are pretty but the chain is an alloy, 14&#34; chain, child size bracelet & adult size earrings. Very cheep made. The Necklace & bracelet are ok for a child, over 5 & under 12."
2.0,"The waist and length are exactly as ordered but the cut of the pants is just terrible. they're super baggy and unprofessional.<br />Tactical, sure. Useful, no."
2.0,This product fit awesome and is so comfy and I would have given it 5 stars BUT I ordered black and it looks navy! I took a picture with a black pair of joggers next to it to show the difference.
2.0,Can‚Äôt give it a review product was sent back cause not a true size.
2.0,it started falling apart within one week of me wearing it.  the chain that comes with it is a joke.
2.0,"This cover up runs VERY small.  I'm 5'1&#34; and somewhat large chested (34D) and it just barely hits my bikini line.  Also in person, this cover up sort of resembles the pirate shirt from Seinfield.  This would probably look best if you ordered a size up and had a smaller chest."
2.0,Once wet the strap cannot be adjusted so it was stuck around my waist after my shower (was too uncomfortable having drains around my neck) so I had to cut it off and now it‚Äôs useless after 2 uses. Buy one with a strap not made from shoelace material so you can adjust it when wet. Waste of $$$.
2.0,The are not true to size order next size up i ordered a 10 they were to short
2.0,"My earrings look nice, but they arrived broken.  The clasps do not lock on either earring....bummed out. Will not buy from this seller again."
2.0,Expected the off the shoulder look got closer to a turtle neck than off the shoulder. Fit ok just not the style in the picture
2.0,The t shirt was too small. The image on the shirt is very blurry and yoy can't even read the text at the top. This is way too much money for such poor quality
2.0,"I returned this shirt. It was quite thin fabric and is a little more tan in color than yellow. It didn‚Äôt fit super well on me, and I was bothered by the ink smell on it probably from screen printing."
2.0,Quality not great and I usually wear a sm iris and the Medium was too small
2.0,there really tiny and weak they protect your eyes though i would not recemmend this crap to anyone looking to spend there hard earned money
2.0,"this is more like a large, squared blanket rather than a scarf - its soft and the quality is good, just disappointed that its more like a blanket than anything and will use it like that."
2.0,Size 10 in men ran very small
2.0,"This suit is a nice suit, but it could be better.  I wanted a retro suit and this was a retro.<br /><br />Problems:<br /><br />I ordered this size due to the reviews on needing a bigger size.  I did order this one too big.<br /><br />1.  For me and probably most with boobs, me 42C, I knew I really needed underwire, but I tried anyway.  The bra was too big, but I know even with the correct size, having no underwire would be a problem.<br />2.  This suit seemed thin, compared to the other Cocoship suit I ordered (Black Inspired Fashion Sweetheart Neckline One Piece Maillot Solids Surplice).<br />3.  This suit lacked tummy control.<br />4.  Kinda a guessing game on trying to pick the correct size to order.<br />I liked the boy shorts in this suit and the bow in the bra area.  Cocoship should offer more suits with underwire."
2.0,"The onsie came with two holes where the hood met the base of the rest of the costume.<br />Luckily I can fix it, but the product should come whole and intact."
2.0,Bad wrist strap
2.0,The dress was way too tight and short
2.0,"Hangs like a sack, denim looks cheesey, belt is cute."
2.0,"Not for me, didn‚Äôt care for"
2.0,How can it shrink lengthwise but expand width wise after washing in cool and hang drying? Should have saved my $
2.0,"I normally wear a size 6 or 8 in pants so I got the Medium for these and they just fit weird - the waist and bum area are quite baggy and loose but they bind in the knee area (despite the stretchy fabric and articulation seams).  Mine were NOT like the item photos in terms of the fact that they had a full elastic waist, not just at the sides as pictured (see my photo).  I think that definitely added to the &#34;granny panty&#34; fit of the pants. They don't show it but the pants come with a nylon belt but, even with that, it was a weird combination of too loose in one area and too tight in another.  It is also worth mentioning that the inseam is only 29 inches on the Medium.  I'm 5'7&#34; and that made these high-waters on me.  I returned them."
2.0,"So I bought two one for and friend and mine, I was only able to use it once which isn't the best sound quality, and now it won't even charge nor turn on, but my friends works"
2.0,I was excited to get this shoes for my daughter so she could use them at school ( she has autism and this are the only type of shoes that she will use ). I bought another pair of the same brand but different color ( pink ) they fit great ! ( size #6 big kid ) but this pair are way too big !!!!!!!!! I decided to keep them just because she will grow up and ended up using them anyways.
2.0,The seams split while I was wearing them. A little disappointed
2.0,The shirt runs just a little bit small.  It had a few tiny stains on it when it arrived and the lips are too off center to ignore.  My daughter decided to keep it but just to wear around the house.
2.0,The pin keeps falling out and after that happens the wallet won't shut tight
2.0,"I just got the pants and tried them on. The fabric material is not soft at all, maybe that's how they make the pants sturdy? There is also a  problem in stitching, see the photo. This is the first time I buy pants online. A little disappointed at the quality."
2.0,Sticky parts don't hold! Buyer beware! I even emailed them because they said they would send another set for Free if I wasn't satisfied no response.
2.0,Don‚Äôt buy. The watchband insertion is held in place by small flathead screws. The jiggle and rattle. I tried tightening them and it doesn‚Äôt help. Went through two watches and realized it‚Äôs a model issue. Don‚Äôt bother with this one. For $200 I expect no rattling.
2.0,The color fades after using it for the first time. I haven‚Äôt wash it yet
2.0,"Just now received and took out of package. Pretty color, a tad thinner than expected and runs really big.<br />Could‚Äôve dealt with all that but there are a couple small discolored (dark spots) on the front and the stitching around the neck is shoddy & is coming undone. I will be returning this."
2.0,Quality not there - flimsy.  I personally found them to be sort of goofy looking - I do use them as a extreme backup though.
2.0,Poorly made. Very small!
2.0,"The hat is OK but it's not the one with the ear flaps as expected. Also, it's polyester (not wool) and is a different color. Top is roomy but the band around head is tight - you'd have to have a small head to wear this. It's not my style, although in the pictures it doesn't look bad."
2.0,No inside buttons to hold wrap. Very odd. I had to take the dress for alterations. Not a good price  because I had to pay extra to make it fit. Hopefully it will when the alterations are completed.
2.0,Not a bad product if you don't have to use a keyboard but if you do the slide is not comfortable under your wrist.
2.0,"Errors in the stickers. Glad I caught the misprints the night before our draft so I could make additional stickers. It also has an extra row on the board. In this case you get what you pay for. Cheap in price, Cheap in quality."
2.0,I am so disappointed because I thought I was buying a burnt orange bikini top and the one that came in was NEON orange. The white bathing suit is also see through...save your money and find a different bikini!
2.0,Good Quality. But I wanted a 3X and the products tag said 3X but it should have been labeled just Large.
2.0,ITS HUGE!! If you‚Äôre a giant and have a huge head ... this will be perfect for you!
2.0,"The socks are a little small and thin. More like dress socks. They are pretty, but not worth the money."
2.0,very difficult to insert in the ears. crude looking
2.0,I really like the colour combinations. Ladies love them too. The straps start get tangled up ad the cross fell off after two days of wearing it. Inferior because of those issues. looks great. Would not buy it again!!
2.0,The seams came  unglued 2 weeks after wearing them. I guess that is why they were priced low. I'm giving them 2 stars because the insides were fuzzy.
2.0,This was marketed as denim.  It is NOT denim.  It is a polished cotton.
2.0,Not what I was expecting. The neckline was awkward and the hem wasn't flattering. I sent this back.
2.0,"Made from the cheapest, heavy, oddly shiny material. Hard dress and fits boxy not flowing as one would expect."
2.0,Material is very thin and ripped by the drawstring opening on the first time they were put on when trying to tie them.
2.0,"Cute jewelry but the quality is not good. The middle part on one of the rings does not face up, it keeps facing down and one can't even tell what  it is."
2.0,It says dialy instead of diary . I mean come on .
2.0,Difficult to secure to from of glasses.
2.0,I loved this because I have two kids and one loves to pull my nose ring. Unfortunately it broke after two weeks and it wasn't by my kids. I was at work and my nose felt funny. I rubbed it and my nose ring fell out. Disappointed. I loved the concept.
2.0,"Torso is short and I'm petite and in shape .  Love the style and it fits fine everywhere except torso is so short ,you need to get size larger then they inform you"
2.0,I am a size 6 and I ordered the small. They are waaaayyyy tooo big!! But they dont have anything smaller :(
2.0,Too small XL
2.0,I have ordered a total of 7 pairs of socks from this dealer and this pair was significantly larger than the other 6 pair. I asked for a return/refund and questioned why I was being asked to pay return postage when this item was too large and obviously was defective. Got tired of the back and forth emails. I won't order these again. If the quality isn't consistent and I am going to have to pay to return it isn't worth the risk. It is a shame because we really like the other six pair of socks.
2.0,Was not impressed by this shirt.  The color wasn't the same as the photo and the shirt is not what I would consider an XL.  Uncomfortably small.  I will not wear it unless I drop 20 pounds.
2.0,The quality is not what I expected. These look very cheap in person.  Too  much trouble to send them back.  Would not purchase these again.
2.0,"Way too short, returning. It is thick but by the picture it looks a lot longer"
2.0,It‚Äôs ok does the job but the magnet is so much bigger than the opal stone. Also hurts when it‚Äôs in designated area .
2.0,The safety pin was lose and  it looks cheap.
2.0,The inside lining ripped and has become shredded with just a few times wearing this jacket. The exterior is soft and it didn't smell like chemicals. The fit was perfect. Just poor quality on the interior.
2.0,stops working after 1 mo.
2.0,Was not as happy as with the shirt.  White lettering on blue was bland and did not show up very good
2.0,"Very cute on the site, but when receiving the product, I was very disappointed. It very very very small, unless u have super short hair, it doesn‚Äôt even show at all"
2.0,Wayyyy tooo small based on the oversized look in the photo I ordered a smaller size it's a skintight sort of spandex instead of a loose fit with a swoop back I can still find a use for it I'm sure..like pair it with a skirt to go out but not the relaxed fit that is shown here.
2.0,"I ordered this gaiter primarily for cycling. Masks that stay on primarily by ear loops tend to come loose during a ride, so I wanted something that won't fall off my face so easily.<br /><br />This gaiter looks good at first, with ear loops to help hold it on and a very soft fabric. On first trying it on, I found it was a bad fit - too wide, easily rides up over my eyes, and yet doesn't cling to the face well enough like a mask. More importantly, the fabric is thin, a single layer, and it fails the breath test - if you put your hand in front of the gaiter and breathe out, you feel most of your breath.<br /><br />This may block dust and dirt, which is still important when riding next to a roadway or during dusty conditions, but it's not suitable for wearing in crowded areas or while shopping or at an indoor setting during COVID."
2.0,I ordered 3x an its more like 1x. So it dont fit.
2.0,"Does not keep feet warm although if you want super slippery sliding socks, tons of fun"
2.0,"Returned, not as pictured."
2.0,"Purchased a large, fit like a child‚Äôs large.  To cheap to return so I gave them away."
2.0,"The picture made the boots seem a lot darker. But they were actually more of a lighter grey then I thought. Seemed kind of flimsy too, like they wouldn't last very long. Did not end up liking them. They were returned."
2.0,Don‚Äôt have a band or elastic so that it fits on you. Basically useless and doesn‚Äôt really fit like the picture.
2.0,Like others said the waist is for a baby. I opened it up and put a larger elastic.Material is nice and washes well. But the quality of stitching is awful. It came all the way from China in the mail. I kept because it would have cost too much sending it back.
2.0,"The dress is beautiful (I already had one in white); however, it arrived reeking of cigarette smoke. I tried it on and it immediately activated my asthma.  I put it straight in the washing machine. The seller should be ashamed to ship a product smelling like that."
2.0,"Comfy but the top fit more like a large and the pants an xl. Sending back because after washing, the seams twisted so badly on both pant legs and twisted slightly on the the top. I read other reviews saying the same. Should have listened. Washed on gentle cycle btw."
2.0,The product with a  underwire still not enough  support for large busted women 36plus
2.0,"These bracelets are super cute and my daughter was mega excited to wear them. She was very gentle with them and it still broke after one use when she took it off to wash her hands. Very, very disappointing. We didn‚Äôt ask for a refund because she wanted to keep it for the sentimental value.. she waited years to become a big sister and this bracelet is how I announced it to her. It was sad to watch her collect the little pieces and cry and tell me she didn‚Äôt want to give it back :("
2.0,The gold ones turnished after 1 wear..the black ones were defective
2.0,Very cheep looking! &#34;Stones&#34; are cloudy looks like plastic. Will be throwing it in with the Halloween stuff
2.0,Not brite enough<br />plastic bulky and very large
2.0,Mine also had the gold stripes down the legs. Would have been very cute without them but unfortunately I am returning the leggings. I usually love Delia leggings for their durability; I‚Äôm sad the item wasn‚Äôt as pictured!
2.0,My little one ware these for an afternoon and jumped in puddles for hours. Well they held up no problem when we got home she had 3 cuts on her feet from the boots rubbing. Will definitely not be wearing these again.
2.0,The vibrant beautiful blue color is false. Its a pastel light blue
2.0,The hat is nice but it‚Äôs a little too flimsy for me. After I‚Äôm in the water and this hat is just to floppy need something little more stiff if you plan on being wet on a regular basis
2.0,"I ordered this necklace because I thought it would look good with my prom dress. It came in packaging that had to be ripped to see the necklace, and once ripped, it can not be returned. The necklace is significantly longer than the photo made me think it would be. Now, I can not wear it with my dress and I can not return it which is a big bummer."
2.0,The fabric is very heavy and the dress is matronly in appearance. I was very disappointed. The return was easy.
2.0,Earrings are much smaller than anticipated. Dull looking.
2.0,Size chart was off. They were too small.
2.0,The picture is so blurry on this shirt. I'll be returning it asap
2.0,Zipper broke right out of bag
2.0,"These fit great. They are super comfortable and stay up well. However, they snag very easily. Any time the Velcro from my jacket touches my leggings it sticks to it and snags a thread. Also, these are NOT thick enough for real winter weather. I know they‚Äôre cheap so what can I expect but they are not what I would consider ‚Äúflannel lined‚Äù. I‚Äôm keeping them and not returning them because they were so cheap and are nice for wearing around the house and other places where I don‚Äôt care if I look nice."
2.0,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, floating through the wind? Yes, Katy. In this I do. Not recommended for large figures. It highlights all the wrong areas. I donated it quickly so I wouldn't have to see it in my closet after wearing it."
2.0,"Not as pictured, poor quality & fit...very disappointed,"
2.0,"Definitely not for taller or ""leggy"" folks. Fit is okay, waistband was looser than expected. To have the band at my ankles the loose legs fit closer to leggings than a jogger. I returned."
2.0,"it was great quality hair,  however, the white streak was actually PINK!  it was too late to order something else so I ewnt ahead and wore it for Halloween."
2.0,I wouldn't consider this a dress.....over leggings but not a dress.
2.0,There's nothing knit about this - it's tshirt like material with color stripes printed on only the outside of it.
2.0,Got XL for my son who's men's M. It was tall enough for 5'6 but not big enough for 32 inch waist and bum.
2.0,hard to get on ear don't wear
2.0,I normally were a size large easily and loosely I ordered a large and it fits slightly tighter than expected I would go a size up
2.0,"I believed I ordered this item before (it is not shown on my orders)  Again it fits, has good spandex material, but the dress smells like fish and spray paint. I will not waste my time attempting to wash it as it should smell clean and new. This item will be returned!"
2.0,Too small for anything but silk/nylon scarves.
2.0,Flimsy scratches easy.
2.0,Seller refunded without issue. Just wasn't comfortable to me...a bit stiff and bulky.
2.0,It was way to small.
2.0,I work in a hospital and wanted something that I wasn‚Äôt going to be too upset over if it got dirty or damaged. But I opened the box and plastic and it doesn‚Äôt work. A battery to change it would cost as much as the watch I bought.  If you need a watch (cheap or not) just keep scrolling.<br />2 stars because it visually cute to me.
2.0,Returned. Dark navy-wish it was black.
2.0,"This dress is cute, but you get what you pay for...the fabric is cut off grain, and sewing together unevenly, which made the collar fit crooked.  Returned."
2.0,Good fit but the glare is awful.
2.0,The rim of the hat is odd and so is the shape. Not as well constructed as I hoped it would be.
2.0,Not breathable. That Mattel rings will hurt me sometime...
2.0,Not quite what the description leads you to believe.  They do have the non slip grips on the bottom but they are not fluffy ot thick. They are quite thin. But will serve the purpose of not walking around on my hardwood floors with lotion on my feet.
2.0,One of the gems fell out a month or two after I purchased these.
2.0,ORDERED A SIZE LARGER THAN NORMAL STILL FIT TIGHT ALSO MINE WAS SHORT SLEEVED NOT 3/4 AS STATED.
2.0,I had high hopes for these because my hair ties are always cutting off my circulation. These are very large and keep slipping off my wrists. They aren‚Äôt easy to manage or make smaller.
2.0,"I love these socks...so soft and comfy...but after only wearing these for only 2 months they are developing holes on the sides!  Not sure why, but they should last longer than 2 months!"
2.0,I bought these for my backpacking adventure in Europe to throw away. I'm glad I threw them away....not comfortable at all.
2.0,Very stretchy material used more so for a night gown not causal out side Wear
2.0,Way too big.  3/4 length sleeves were longer. Gown was to my ankles.  I will keep it anyway.
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter who had her ears pierced in the past, but due to a sensitivity issue can no longer wear any type of earrings with a post. She loved the look of them and loved the idea of them 100% - she was excited to be able to wear earrings again. Unfortunately, EVERY SINGLE TIME she's worn a pair of these magnetic earrings, she's lost one or both within half an hour. The magnets are just not strong enough, and the earrings are guaranteed to fall off. If these were made with magnets that were stronger, I would absolutely rebuy, but as they stand, I feel like I've just thrown away money."
2.0,"I am 5 ft 4, 34C, and 120 pounds and this dress was way too tight in the shoulders and the sleeves were super short. The dress length was also much shorter than expected. The pockets were the only nice things about this dress. Definitely order a size up or from a different company, I am returning this dress."
2.0,"the vest doesnt fit as it seems to larger then a small, the buttons dont line up straight so it looks like the vest is lopsided/crooked. And the texture/pattern reminds me of cheap hotel drapes from the 80s.<br /><br />dont waste your money, i have a coofandy vest and i am far more pleased with that purchases then this."
2.0,"This earrings are soo, soo small!"
2.0,It wasn‚Äôt what I expected
2.0,The cut is different from the picture shown...even the fabric is.<br />Disappointed
2.0,I didn‚Äôt realize they were going to have such a yellow cast to them. I kept them. Wish I would have returned them.
2.0,Fabric began to pill prior to washing and I wouldn't recommend it for any dressy functions. But it's a good everyday dress next time I won't be buying a dark color because of the pilling.
2.0,these are plastic and although comfortable I wouldn't wear them out of the house so I have some new slipps
2.0,"nice look, nice fabric, too small"
2.0,Fairly large bag. The zipper came broken so I wasn't able to close the back and the middle compartment in the bag proved to be more hassle than help. This is being returned!
2.0,I have a small head. And this piece doesn't fit the way it should. It doesn't come with any extensions on it. But fortunately I do charming so I plan to extend it through my knowledge of that.
2.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; 210 lbs.. So I figured XL would fit.. So when I received it.. it was more like a large.. sleeves were way too short and fit a little snug. So I sent it back and ordered a XXL. Well it wasn't that much bigger than the XL I first bought..now I'm a bit worried how it will fit after the first washing. also, It's a men's jacket.. So why is the zipper on the left side and not the right side like most if not all men's jackets.. I guess if your 5'7&#34; or shorter.. this jacket should fit you just fine.."
2.0,The color is more orange and I ordered a large but should of gotten a medium. I missed the return date and now I am stuck with a shirt that‚Äôs too big :(
2.0,"Too snug! I'm 6'3&#34;, 240...2XLT usually has more than enough room for me. This one fits very snugly. Won't be able to wear it."
2.0,sent it back due to it being unrealistic for a woman with a 36 c cup
2.0,"The flower is large. Too big for the nose in my opinion. It says it‚Äôs made of surgical steel, but it made my piercing very irritated. It was also difficult to put in. Very beautiful overall, would consider wearing as an earring if possible."
2.0,This our great for the person who does not have big girls to carry around.  Didn't work for me.
2.0,"Very dissatisfied. I was going to send them back, as they are very small, and did not lock properly.<br />I decided to keep them, and just use them in my second pierced hole, not the primary piercing on my earlobe.<br />They are hidden however, with longer hair.<br /><br />I also had to adjust the hinge, to get them both to lock into the space on the opposite side.<br />They did come in a timely fashion."
2.0,This is a great sized wallet and worked for what it was intended to work for i bought it the end of july and its the beginning of september and it already has frayed edges and slightly coming apart unfortunately so i dont think its made of the best material
2.0,I had ordered A half-size up because they ran small. I'm returning these because the  foot bed and arch fits weirdly. The arch is too far back towards the heel.
2.0,Narrow and short. I should have ordered 2 sizes up.  Other brands are truer to size for my grand daughter.
2.0,I'm 5 1 and this sweater hits me as at belly button
2.0,"The fabric is really cheap. The print is a good lookalike, but one that I wouldn‚Äôt wear<br />It feels inconfortable-it is shiny cheap.<br />It even has golden stripes"
2.0,"It‚Äôs a decent mask. It‚Äôs of fair quality; I was hoping my kids wouldn‚Äôt run away.  But, they ran in terror."
2.0,"Says metal frame but its not. Huge and the clips would not fit over the lenses. In spite of that, we had to pay return postage. Rip off."
2.0,very loose fitting even ordering my size per the size chart
2.0,Very pretty color. Very short shirt. It cannot be tucked in.
2.0,"This wig is nothing like the picture displayed, it's difficult to work with and very stiff like. To ME it in no way looks like Elvis's look."
2.0,"Didn‚Äôt fit right for my body type, wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable and confident"
2.0,Pretty - but from Chine way TOO small
2.0,Grandma Dress
2.0,"Not crazy about these, will not order again"
2.0,Gonna say the color is kinda tacky for my taste.<br />The ribbon is something you need to tie in front of the zipper so that it hides it in the back. The stitching is really weird and shows through.
2.0,"The paper that goes over the emblem was hard to peel off and it peeled off some of the emblem.  Additionally, we have had the capes less than two weeks and have played with them maybe twice and the Velcro has already come off.  I was very disappointed in this product.  My godson loved the idea of running around with his cape but the product disappointed."
2.0,"Is Ok, but only OK. It seems very thin. Depends on your needs."
2.0,"Light weight and good color. Hood stays up, but overall perhaps a little small. Sheds water in light rain UNTIL IT SOAKS THROUGH. NOT WATERPROOF, ONLY WATER RESISTIENT."
2.0,"I loved how it looked and it is stamped 925.  Therefore I added my charms and wore proudly along with my faney-expensive Pandora.  The removable screw will open itself and if it wasn't because I am extermely lucky, I would have lost it.  I can't wear because I can't be checking the screw all the time to avoid loosing my bracelet.  Therefore I do not like it and would not reccommend it."
2.0,"Several fell apart,  poor quality"
2.0,"When I put a pair of these socks on, I was very surprised to feel the rough interior. They were so uncomfortable that I‚Äôm wearing them inside out, which is working out fine. I was also hoping that they had more cushioning on the heels. Disappointing."
2.0,Not horrible for the price but everything appears smokey.
2.0,"My girls were so excited to get these so they could match each other in class, however, when they tried them on everything fit except the left shoulder.  The strap for both was too long. It didn‚Äôt fit snug like the rest of the leotard. I ended up having to cut and sew them so the straps were equal to the other side. You can see now on the teal one I have cut out about 2 inches and it‚Äôs now even with the other side.  The pink is clearly longer as I haven‚Äôt corrected yet. Very cute leotards but not ideal since reconstruction was needed."
2.0,"Like everyone else, I ordered two kaftans from this company and received the wrong colors. I ordered a green kaftan tunic and got a purple floor length one. I also ordered a purple kaftan tunic and received a red wrong with all the wrong print on it. Odd. The prints are completely different.. Odd."
2.0,"At first this belly ring was okay; very long, but I attributed that to the fact that it will grow with you as your belly grows. It was a bit uncomfortable because it was so long & plastic-like, and always seemed to be getting in the way & I tended to hit it every so often, After a few weeks, I ended up with a slight irritation/infection (although I cleaned the area every day) so I had to take this out. It went away a few days later after treating it with peroxide & a cream. So overall, I would've given this a 4 star since I didn't like the length & feel, but after my belly button hole got irritated and I had to take the ring out - now it's worthless and just sitting in my bathroom drawer."
2.0,"Once I got this thing in my body, it fit ok. But the band was way too tight and hard to maneuver to be worth keeping, so I sent it back and ordered the one with a hook back that is perfect."
2.0,The concept is cute but it doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. It is actually quiet blurry looking.
2.0,Not the fit I  was expecting.
2.0,Used for putting chains and binders on equipment and the palm material tore from moderate use
2.0,"Cute, material was decent but a little odd fit but wearable. Basically true to size"
2.0,Very very cute but tarnished after a week. Now it looks like tarnished garbage.
2.0,Fell appart
2.0,The color was faded looking so I returned them.
2.0,"Super cute, but runs extremely small!"
2.0,"I felt the cups run slightly large. Didn't do much to lift, just kid of held ""the girls"" in towards the middle and acted as pasties. Might work better for lift with the addition of some tape, but there are definitely better porducts for the money."
2.0,"Like all soundtracks if you heard the tune at all during an episode you probably just heard 30 seconds or so of it, (some tunes were over 10 minutes in length‚Ä¶the entire scene wasn't that long). I listened to the whole thing and may not ever do that again.<br />I thought the sound quality was poor, most of the selections didn't amount to much. I like a tune that makes me think ""I wish I had some video to use that in""‚Ä¶not this one. I think that of the three Supergirl soundtrack CD's this one is the worst. I don't see a fourth listed, maybe they haven't been selling well enough to justify  making more."
2.0,These are very thin and far too small. I have ‚Äútiny‚Äù feet by many people‚Äôs standards (size 7) and these feet restrictive and stretched more than comfortable when on. The cut is nice (I favor the straight across style vs the rounded) but the material is very cheap and far too thin (see photos).
2.0,"Cute top,very short and runs very small."
2.0,"Gym, felt like I had on a medium, still wearing them . Just tight on lol"
2.0,"i loved these, they are ADORABLE.  Unfortunately, the SMELL was unbearable.  I aired them out for about a week and they STILL smelled like straight up chemicals. In the process of returning now."
2.0,Could not get them over the sides. If you glasses are thinner it might work better.
2.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): Like another reviewer on here, I found the posts way too thick to get into my ear holes.  In addition to being thicker than normal, the posts also have a little hook on them so when I was trying to put them in my ear the little hook was catching inside my ear hole and made it painful.  So unfortunately these earrings are totally unwearable for me.<br /><br />If you have wider ear holes that can accommodate the thick posts I say go for it.  The earrings are extremely beautiful.  They will not fool anyone into thinking they are ""real"" but the green crystal and the faux diamonds are pretty stunning."
2.0,"Huge with small arm holes. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 135. Got the small. It‚Äôs as long as a sun dress. But arm holes are too snug. I‚Äôd imagine the medium would fit like a potato sack. Not linen, Very course. Every piece of dust and lint from a mile around is attracted to it."
2.0,"These were good for one day. I bought them for my daughter to wear at her mermaid themed bday party. They looked great for the party, but the next time she wore them the knees were turning black."
2.0,Some of these were dull and some were great.<br />I am a great fan of sparkle.<br />But getting them so fast is great.
2.0,The fit was way too small.
2.0,"I ordered 1 of these masks for my 9 year old daughter and she loved it.  Good fit, cute and has a filter pocket. She doesn‚Äôt like the masks with the elastic as they bug her ears.  I ordered 2 more masks and they are different sizes in compared to the first one we got. Disappointed in the variation of sizes. The first masks I would give 5 stars, the two that just came are too small."
2.0,Poorly made and not as picture shows
2.0,"This top is very cute, however I ordered the X-Large which is the largest size they offer and it is still too small. It fits more like a medium so I would order at least one to two sizes up if you are wanting to buy this top. Also keep in mind that it is on the thinner side so your bra might show through the material, mine did and I didn't want to have to wear a cami underneath either. I will be returning this top."
2.0,"Love the color. However, when I wore for the  first time, a hole in the crotch occurred. I don‚Äôt know if they fit right."
2.0,Expected a dimensional &#34;tear drop&#34; crystal. This has a flat back & I did not care for the design in glass. I'm a great fan of Venetian-Murano glass art but this just didn't grab me.
2.0,Thin material. Made for odd shape.
2.0,"For tall people these pants are way too short. The crotch is also really awkwardly long. I had to buy them for work, but I will never wear them in public outside of the fitness center."
2.0,"Ugly, poorly made gloves - no surprise for the price. A good choice if you need a disposable fabric glove"
2.0,"The sunglasses are way to cool but the polarized started to fell off the lenses just the week after i received them(the lenses are half black and the other half is transparent), that sucks, i used to have vonzipper and arnette sunglasses, and that naver happend."
2.0,"Bought as a costume for an adult but found to be way too small, it's sized for a small child. Other wise reminds me of Tom Hanks hat in the movie."
2.0,"So, this is listed as Asian XXL, US L. Yeah, no. I'm 5'9"" 175 lbs. Full length hit me 7"" above my ankle.  The waist is a good 5"" too big and that cute little skirt is sooooo long. It's about 2"" above my knee.  Ugh.  Don't waste your time."
2.0,"I am keeping these but they are pretty cheap looking and very snug. Other reviews said they were very stretchy, and they do stretch but if you have a waist above 32 inches, these are not for you."
2.0,I bought this specifics for the septum rings. They were so flimsy that I couldn't actuary get them into my nose so I ended up not using them.
2.0,Very easy to break but it's really pretty.
2.0,longer than expected
2.0,Dress looks cheap.
2.0,"Although the dress is great..ok material and beautiful pattern, the zipper doesn't work at all. Looks like it will be a great fit once i take it to the tailor to get a functioning zipper."
2.0,"It is so much smaller than every other XL dress I have bought, many of them from Asian companies.  This one looked far more like a Small or Medium.  No way my ribbcage will ever get into the bodice of this!"
2.0,These were much smaller and thinner than expected. Wouldn't order them again.
2.0,Material is thin. Shows every bump and bulge
2.0,"The floral fabric is beautiful. I was hoping this would be a casual dress that I could wear to work or on vacation, or slip on for church. Unfortunately, I will be returning it. I am only 5‚Äô4‚Äù and this dress is way too short."
2.0,"Bought two for a friend and I. Doesn't appear like in picture, too small to wear comfortably, doesn't fit friend at all, and visor isn't dark enough to obscure features."
2.0,Definitely not TTS shorts. Very disappointing because I really liked these online! They were just to tight and accentuated my mom pooch.
2.0,"This is a nice, soft scarf, but it is not worth $8.99. It's literally a strip of jersey fabric that has been stitched together at the ends to make a loop, the edges aren't even hemmed. Also, after one wash, it's already starting to stretch out and lose its elasticity.  It's also getting fuzzy and I anticipate it will start to pill in another couple of washes.<br /><br />While I like the look, and it is comfortable and functional for spring/summer wear, the mark-up for this scarf is too ridiculous. I could go to Jo-Ann's fabrics and buy a yard of this material for $4 and make 6-7 of these in ten minutes, which is exactly what I guess I will do this weekend.<br /><br />If you're looking for a scarf to last you one, maybe two seasons, and you don't mind spending $9 on a $0.50 strip of fabric, then this would be a good scarf for you."
2.0,"The corset top is not the one received. The skirt is an XL as ordered, but the top is ML. Will not fit anyone over a B cup. It is pretty but completely useless to me."
2.0,"Would not buy again. Very odd, shiny material. Shirt is very long and runs a little large. Would return but not worth the trouble."
2.0,Findings were sticking out and hurt fingers.
2.0,I like the gown however it runs small in size!
2.0,"did not fit my nose piece , they fall off when I clean my glasses."
2.0,Reasonably well made but otherwise overpriced for the poor quality fabric.  The dress was HUGE.
2.0,Not true to size.  Did not like material at all.
2.0,"liked that the toes were exposed, but they were very tight.  I ordered a large, and I wear a size small 4 or 6, and they were still too small and constricted.  these were returned."
2.0,so pretty but broke in a day :(
2.0,Glass where gift.  Subject said he like and was using then each day.
2.0,"Very cute, but broke the first day worn"
2.0,It was a beautiful stone but it was a little bit damaged and I was disappointed
2.0,"really cute rings, wish they were a little bigger. I feel like I have small hands and they were pretty snug can only wear some of them"
2.0,If there's a wider one I am thinking of trying it. I hope they sell a wider variety. Cause this one isn't doing it for me. Now I will say it does take your tummy fat away. I just didn't like the fact that I couldn't breathe wearing it.
2.0,"However, this time they were very dried out!  I was very disappointed!"
2.0,I was so excited to get this shirt in!!! Wore it one time an washed it an the print turned yellow (at first was white.) This was washed inside out an not with anything that would or should turn the print yellow. Also the print started coming off. Is cheaply made or I got a faulty one.
2.0,"Too tight in the arms, elastic on the sleeves is way too tight"
2.0,I was really disappointed when I opened these sunglasses. They look nothing like the picture. The frames are solid red instead of black and red that's in the picture. And the lenses are just regular color lenses instead of the colorful lenses that it shows in the picture. Unless you prefer regular solid red framed sunglasses I wouldn't recommend purchasing these.
2.0,It‚Äôs not actually peach. It‚Äôs pumpkin orange. Probably good to wear only this month ( October) . Otherwise I look ridiculous. I should‚Äôve ordered a different color!
2.0,I sized up and they are still way too small. Even if they were the correct size they wouldn't have been high wasted. Frustrating.
2.0,They fit me small n tight
2.0,The glasses didn't help. Still saw halos and starbursts. My doctor suggested polarized ones.which these were suppose to be.
2.0,"It seems ok, but I did not get a zipper bag for easy storage as the description said. A bit disappointing."
2.0,Cute shoes but they are cut soooo small. Ordered the next size up and they are still too small.
2.0,"I've given this mask 2 stars because, for me, it's not a good choice. But someone else might like it. I find the fabric, which isn't cotton, to be unpleasantly thick and oppressive. It makes my face feel clammy and sweaty, especially if I talk. Also, it's enormous. The adjustable ear straps are nice, tho they don't help with the size issue for me. But then, I'm a woman with a smaller/narrower face. It would probably be great for someone with a large face. But the problems with the sweaty material--I don't know. Maybe in very cold weather it would be fine. Ultimately, I find it unpleasant and so don't use these masks. Money wasted."
2.0,"I really liked these socks, they were comfortable and great for running. One sock ended up developing a hole by the toe after about a year. So I decided to take them up on the lifetime guarantee. After filing a warranty claim, I had to spend more money mailing the socks to them and never heard back from them."
2.0,"I like the product my only concern is because the stones are not red ...,they look like a pink dark<br />But I really like the product üëç"
2.0,I didnt expect this shirt to be so thin and see through
2.0,Decent for the price but gold accent pieces on either side fell off with in days of wearing them.
2.0,It was really thin more like a shirt
2.0,"Fits at minimum 2 sizes too small!<br />Otherwise, really cute! When I lose my ‚ÄúCovid weight‚Äù I will enjoy it:)"
2.0,Looks good but fits poorly
2.0,That sits too far of the face and the wind gets in and it‚Äôs just blowing in the eyes. It‚Äôs easier to not wear them.
2.0,Couldn't use my phone with this.
2.0,The fleece is soft but the product runs small and shrinks significantly in the wash. My son was only able to wear this once before it shrunk too small to wear again. Very disappointing
2.0,"Product arrived a bit earlier than expected which was a plus however, the print is very blurry. Quality Isn‚Äôt quite what I expected."
2.0,"The band is not secure enough. There are much better bands out there. It looks nice on and that‚Äôs what hooked me, but I‚Äôm afraid I could lose my watch."
2.0,beautiful but sized for a 3-5 year old and the scarf is short but it looked great on my 3 year old
2.0,"The good:<br /><br />They fit perfectly<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />They seem to be very cheap. They are more than half as thin as the original Oakley lenses and weigh significantly less which makes the glasses feel very different on my face. Also, the lenses have a lot of red tint in them on the outside, just as much red as green, you can see it in the picture I included. In the photo description of the lenses you can't see red anywhere. Viewed from the inside the tint is actually red and not green. Oddly, there is green tint to the outside as you look through them which is really distracting as looking directly ahead is red but it transitions, sloppily, to green on the outside spectrum.<br /><br />Also, I don't believe they are polarized or If they are it is a much lower quality polarization than my original, if that's possible.They do not affect any LCD screens in my car or anywhere, viewing my phone is just as easy if I weren't wearing sunglasses whereas I could barely see the screens in the car with the original Oakley lens. Hard to explain but they also just don't feel polarized to the eye. They do however turn black when looking through them at a computer screen and rotating them 90 degrees (a test to see if glasses are polarized.)<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the color.. I wanted green or as Oakley calls it &#34;Jade Iridium&#34; the product picture shows these matching very close to that green but in fact they have a ton of red and purple in them as well as the blue that is shown. I would think with a green lens the view through them would be tinted green but it's not, it's red. I find green much cleaner and crisper than red. [[ASIN:B00ZJSJ2C0 Revant Polarized Replacement Lens for Oakley OffshootEmerald Green MirrorShield]]<br /><br />Disappointing."
2.0,Not as think as I thought.
2.0,Just got them in the mail. I had my son try on the black one and it broke right away. He is also complaining of being too tight.
2.0,"I thought I could pull off wearing the medium, I was wrong. Needed one sz up. But, I honest didn‚Äôt like the quality as much as others I‚Äôve purchased on here. Material is very thin. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 140#"
2.0,"It turned my finger green in two days, other than that it was really pretty."
2.0,"Not so crazy about the way it fits.  It is basically cut like a square or rectangle, so it appears bigger and thought that it didn't enhance a figure.  Maybe if I tied it like the model in one of the pictures shown it would help.  The colors are bright, but in some lights it doesn't appear as bright."
2.0,"Wore this for not even 1 day & the chain broke. It was pretty & exactly as pictured, just didn't last...at all."
2.0,"Very nice rings, but all the same size! I now have 50 rings that fit ONE of my fingers. I thought, if I'm getting 50 rings, they must be a variety. Because who wants 50 of the same size... But no... So now I have 50 rings that only fit the ring finger of my left hand. Super convenient..."
2.0,"This bra, ordered bigger than what I normally wear, could not possibly be the size I ordered.  I couldn't even get it on!  It has two different hook strap sections in the back that are impossible to hook while they are in the back.  I had to pull them around to the front to hook the hooks, and then couldn't get the straps on.  I also tried hooking them and then pulling this on over my head.  That didn't work either."
2.0,"Cute costume but not at all true to the Chucky character. Says ‚Äúgood boys‚Äù instead of ‚Äúgood guys.‚Äù Sizing is smaller than expected. If you‚Äôre looking for a more authentic look, this is not it. However, if you still want to order.. order AT LEAST one size up. Possibly two."
2.0,Can't adjust it and it is too loose.
2.0,The size was not true to fit!!!
2.0,"The sunglasses are made from a good material and they come with a high-quality case. The only problem is the shape of the sunglasses themselves, which makes them awkward and completely unwearable. Wanted to like them, but they need a redesign."
2.0,"The exterior ooks beautiful but the construction feels cheap once you get it home and open. We ordered two maybe two or three months ago and are already in the position of replacing both. The handles have pulled out from the top, and a drawer is broken on one. The day we received them there was something in the &#34;close&#34; part that came loose and needed gluing down immediately. On top of that, just on a practical note, it's a little bulky for kids to tote. There's too much weight on the handle, which is why I think both of ours pulled free. It does fit an American Girl Doll with plenty of room to spare but with the thin ties rather than Velcro straps (which some use) the doll really isn't very well stabilized in there. It definitely had some wow factor when we unpacked it but with things coming apart and the inconvenience of it in practical use I would not consider reordering."
2.0,"Cute design, strange shape. Wear a small (rarely a medium) everywhere else, ordered a large because I was warned they run small and it‚Äôs still barely big enough and clings unattractively to all my little imperfections (and strangely the sleeves are very long which doesn‚Äôt bother me but might drive some people crazy). Wanted to love this as the fabric and construction quality are both great, just couldn‚Äôt."
2.0,"After only wearing this ring for only 1 day, the shiny coating is coming off. I‚Äôve only washed my hands with soap and water so there‚Äôs no reason it should already be wearing off."
2.0,Cute pattern but small. Would probably fit a standard small/medium
2.0,Shirt was too long in body and sleeves<br />There are short fat people.  Went to costco<br />-- much better fit.
2.0,"This stress stretched out and looked gray instead of black, so I gave it a 2 star rating for that reason...other than that it is cute for the price."
2.0,really thin material
2.0,"It looks ok, but it is a cheap product. The slider has come off from the inner zip liner, and the 24&#34; case has cracked on its first use. I'm currently pursuing a claim with the airline."
2.0,"The chain was awful quality, the one I received was BROKEN right out of the box. Chain is large & cheap-looking... looks like plastic from the dollar store. Also doesn't hang well if you have any breasts to speak of."
2.0,Not as loose fitting as shown in photo. Would not buy again.
2.0,"Weird, camo 34&#34; fit great, but black 34&#34; is way too small."
2.0,I bought two dresses the same size. One fit perfectly but I could not get this one over my head.  The other one that fit-the stitches were coming out. I returned them both. I am leery of buying now because of the inconsistency.  I am sad as honestly I wanted them all.
2.0,1st one of these I had lasted about a year and half which was good but idk what changes you made but the one you just sent lasted 5 mins before the quick release broke so this a no go
2.0,"I like the quality. However, I normally wear medium but reading that these run small, I ordered the large size. These large are smaller than any medium I‚Äôve ever owned! They are uncomfortably tight on me."
2.0,See through :(
2.0,It is oversized even for toddlers.
2.0,Bought it because the color was great but the quality was not so much. Zipper won't zip probably but you get what you pay for.
2.0,"I loved the raw gemstone but after wearing it a couple of times the finish on the small beads came off, so I returned it."
2.0,"This didn‚Äôt look anything like it was pictured. I got the peacock blue in a small, my usual size. The fabric is ribbed and it does not show that way on the model. Secondly, there is so much extra fabric between the neck line and the scrunch, it just looks 2 sizes too big. The sleeves were the correct length, so even those who wear above a size small, wouldn‚Äôt benefit as the sleeves would then be too small."
2.0,I have a Marshal Key holder that has 5 spots for a key chains and I have not bought 5 extra key holders because these just keep falling apart. My wife's fell apart and I just thought she was too hard on it but then mine fell apart so we now have 4 broken key chains. I found some Fender one that seem better quality.
2.0,"Material fine , but fits small"
2.0,Good Size ring but it came defective. Buyer beware the images on the ring came messed up.
2.0,"The belt is high quality, the design of the belt buckle is great, it is why I purchased it but it has one major flaw, the unlatching mechanism.<br />To put in one word, its crap. At the third day of wearing day it decided for itself to stop working and I couldnt take off my pants, the only thing<br />I could do was cut through the belt with a scissor, I regret the minute I did it, but the locking mechanism just didnt work.<br />I would buy it again only if they change their locking mechanism, sadly its the only bad thing to say about this belt, other than that you can<br />see and feel the excellent quality of the product.<br />Shame"
2.0,"This item emits a very offensive odor. As a result, it's not something I would use."
2.0,Eye holes were too far apart and I was unable to see
2.0,"Started falling apart on me within the first week of normal use. One of the hooks for the laces snapped. They started developing rips on the side and the soles started coming loose far too soon. After about a month, I needed new shoes."
2.0,"These gloves are comfortable, but disappointed in the color.  It is not a gray or a true brown.  I wanted more of a Neutral or calfskin light beige color glove, as shown in the picture.  Not impressed with the color as not as shown."
2.0,"liked the style, but the romper was too large for my frame (size medium - 5'3&#34; 125 lbs, 36C) and i was not a fan of the fabric. I think it would've been better in a softer more flowy fabric."
2.0,Mmmmm.... not very good qualilty.
2.0,I returned it. Too big
2.0,"Need to have direct sunlight for fan to operate properly. If solar panel is not pointed directly into the sun the fan slows down to almost nothing. If used in the shade, even at high noon on a sunny day, fan doesn't work!!! When fan IS working well the breeze will dry your eyes. A better option would be a hat like this that is battery operated with some kind of speed control."
2.0,"I can't run in these, they rub the inside of my thigh.  Fit is awkward, as though the hips are too small and the waist isn't even."
2.0,"Poor too small, no screws to put together."
2.0,Size is all messed up.
2.0,Right out of the package the collars on all 3 shirts looked/felt stretched out. Ordered medium (like every other shirt that I own) and these fit like they are size large. Only good thing is the material is nice.
2.0,"The top was extremely too small.  Needed a size 12 for an extremely thin daughter and it fit our extremely thin size 6 daughter.  Although the shorts fit as expected, I was disappointed in the quality."
2.0,"The item seem cheap in person, didn‚Äôt like how the outfit fitted, it seem too big. Ordered a large."
2.0,To small  didnt like it .it more like for little  girls
2.0,Es super trasparente
2.0,"Thin, light weight latex mask. Closer to what I'd expect at half the price point."
2.0,Runs very small I ordered a large and it fits like a tight medium.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay ‚Äúgold‚Äù
2.0,Two stars for the price. It's a good inexpensive value which is what you're getting .  It's huge and super fake looking.  Didn't fit right and when I went to return it they wanted half of the purchase price for return shipping.  Now I'm stuck with a big fake I'll fitting ring I'll never wear. Good thing I paid less than 15 for it.
2.0,Is pretty and my daughter was really enjoying it but after wearing it only 5 times the chain broke.
2.0,"I‚Äôm embarrassed that I bought these. And ordered two. Don‚Äôt do it. Just stick to brands you trust. These are a waste of money, completely. ‚Äú FASHION DESIGN STYLE WITHOUT THE the specifics and tries to be extrsordinsry ‚Äú. What even the hell?!"
2.0,"Other shirts in same brand fits good, this one not"
2.0,This top arrived ahead of estimated arrival time. Unfortunately the top does not look at all like the picture. The only thing that was the same was the top had a gray background. The floral print was way off. I do not care for this top at all.
2.0,"I ordered a small based on reviews, but it was huge.  I am normally a medium, but the dress was really big and the pockets seemed odd right below the hips.  There were no tags on the dress to be able to tell what size it is.  I didnt care for the quality and returned it"
2.0,Received order and was quite happy with leaf. I had ordered a 30&#34; chain but this chain was significantly shorter. Returned pendant and chain.
2.0,I've ordered the product twice same size each time. First time they were too big above the knee second time too small only up to mid calf. The quality is great if only the size was as ordered and consistant
2.0,Huge and cheap quality
2.0,Was very thick and hard to breathe with it on !!
2.0,"I ordered this dress in a size small (I am 5'3"", 119 lbs -  muscular build).  The Beige color was dingy, making it look like it was a well worn dress that was many years old.  The main negative point for the dress, though, was the fit around the hips.  I have a larger, muscular butt so I usually have a problem with things fitting too tightly in the hip/butt area.  I had the opposite problem with this dress.  The dress is cut for someone who is VERY curvy as it did not even slightly hug my curves; the material poked out around my hips."
2.0,Runs small. Not as full in the body as depicted in the picture.
2.0,"Cheap, the hair kept shedding and the mask was hard to see out of"
2.0,Distorted vision and did not help the glare of lights at night
2.0,"The &#34;coin&#34; which is a very, very thin piece of metal was mailed bent so first I had to straighten that out before I could figure a way to tie it on my wrist.  The &#34;coin&#34; will capture any substance and keep it in its crevasses so be careful of that and keep a brush handy for cleaning."
2.0,Size: I got a 2XL so that there would be plenty of room - there is not. It fits like a small XL. Be sure to order size up. Material: It does breathe but it has absolutely no stretch to it at all not even as much as cotton. The material is satisfactorily comfortable but again not as soft as cotton. The iron-on logo on the left chest after just a few minutes of wear is starting to flake off. The sewing seems satisfactory. Some people may like this shirt; I really don't so hopefully someone at Goodwill will get some benefit out of it.
2.0,I felt like the band was flimsy
2.0,This dress was extremely big for a large. I wear a 40dd and usually order large to x-large to accommodate my bust.  I could swim in this dress and it did not fit right under the arms.  Very disappointed
2.0,"The boa looked fine. When we took it out of the package, feathers started dropping off. And they just kept on dropping. My wife borrowed another from a friend and I dropped this boa at St Vincent de Paul."
2.0,"The band has a good weight, nice thickness and has a scratch resistant black coating.  The problem I had was a pin on the clasp failed.  It sheered right off and there is no easy way to fix this issue."
2.0,I ordered a 2XL and this is like a small smh definitely sizing fit for a child not an adult
2.0,"Loved the color, but the armholes were huge and the shirt was long and tight. I returned it."
2.0,"the backpack image is good but there is only 1 pouch on the whole bag and no storage anywhere, if I would have seen that I would have purchased something better for school"
2.0,"It changed color right away and that was truly disappointing. It seemed to be a good product at first, but then it wasn‚Äôt. The metal does hide the Orula beads very well, maybe purchasing a silver one instead of gold is a better choice. The bracelet has very good quality, but there is a down side which is the color."
2.0,"The compartments are nice but the entire case is very un-sturdy. the dividers started coming apart immediately and the entire frame of the case is coming apart, I've had it for six months, never leaves my house and doesn't take a beating so there's no reason for it to come apart. Wouldn't recommend buying at all."
2.0,In photo looks like a nice quality material.  Not the case when you receive.  Lots of threads hanging around and needed to trim.  Would have returned but it was a Christmas present.  Ended up giving to daughter.  Color was not white was more of an off white.  Completely different from photo.
2.0,They didn't account for women with large buttocks. It didn't go over my read area at all.
2.0,"Super cute dress and my daughter loved it! Giving two stars because the bow wasn‚Äôt attached and it arrived the Saturday before Easter, so we had to do some quick thinking to get the bow attached"
2.0,"It's as pretty as it looks, but if you've ever had allergic reactions to cheap jewelry I wouldn't recommend. I've never had an issue with belly button rings before (likely because they're typically surigical steel), but only wore this thing for a few hours before my skin became painful and irritated."
2.0,"Its very long and fits oddly.  I don't know if it was just cut differently, or what.  I ordered a large.  The fit is okay, but on me, it's about 6 inches longer than the picture shown, but yet cut higher in the neckline.  I am an average build and an hourglass shape, so I was disappointed.  My daughter actually bought the same top through another company and hers looks/fits completely differently.  It was a little disappointing."
2.0,"The material is very thin and flimsy. It slides around and looks baggy and feels really uncomfortable. I solved the problem by wearing them on top of thicker, stretchier leggings, but the crotch still slides down and is a pain to deal with, not to mention the uncomfortably thin waistband. The graphic is done really well, though. I do like them well enough when I pair them on top of better leggings."
2.0,"These would be perfect except the blue color is more of a power blue than the royal blue pictured. I bought the same set of rings for my husband since we're both active and his ring is the bright royal blue pictured on the website. All of the other colors matched the picture and my husband's rings exactly so I'm not sure what happened with the blue ring. Since the blue color is the main reason I bought the rings, I'm returning them."
2.0,"The bottoms are bigger, but too small... Like a diaper."
2.0,"These are very similar to a pair I had years and years ago in design and look. They are warm and thick, though at first a little too small for my hands (I wear size 7 gloves at the hospital if that means anything to you and have long fingers). I bought them for a trip to Iceland, and was happy until they started to fall apart. I wasn't even doing anything too adventurous with them on, but the fold-over mitten part started to come off the main body of the glove after just a few days."
2.0,I received other shirts from this same seller and they fit just fine but these were a bit too small.
2.0,"Super cute top, I'm 5'2&#34; and 115 pounds and bought a small. It fit perfect. But I wore it once and the button BROKE. :("
2.0,My husband is hearing impaired and we thought these would be great. They steam up so much he can‚Äôt see to read my lips ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  They are now just sitting on a shelf. Very disappointed
2.0,The shirt is not even close of the one at the picture.  Quality is not the best either.
2.0,I was looking forward to this dress but was disappointed. I normally wear large or 12 in US size. This dress was advertised  as XL. It fits like a M or 8.
2.0,"These are not the same Defender products I've purchased in the past.  These are very thin, cheap compression shorts.  Not the high quality materials I'm used to receiving.  I'm not sure if Defender changed their products, but the last 2 sets of their base layer products I've ordered are made of much cheaper materials.<br /><br />I guess I'll stick with the supply I have and look for another brand.  It's too bad.  The previous iterations of Defender compression gear were top-notch and a good bargain."
2.0,closing doesn't hold. watch falls off
2.0,not to happy over al look of beads
2.0,Didn't really compress much. Still had moobs. It's like a compression shirt that doesn't do its job. Will not buy again.
2.0,The sweater too was not as long as the picture. So I was disappointed. It‚Äôs about half the size of the picture. The dress fits fine.
2.0,I didn't like the feel of the fabric.
2.0,It's pretty but not as long as it appears in the picture
2.0,"Dress didnt look anythibg like the picture. Breast part is stiff. But pretty for someobe else. Runs small, maybe 2 sizes."
2.0,"The dress is really cute, but the small was too big in the top area and I‚Äôm not small there!  You could also see through it."
2.0,I wanted to like this! I pulled it out of the box and it was so soft and perfect for winter but then I put it on and it was not good. It has an odd split at the hips which makes you look like your wearing a loin cloth which is not the look I (or anyone) is going for haha. Maybe it would work better for someone shorter )I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7) I almost kept it to wear at home because it is so darn cozy but it just looks so silly
2.0,Good Quality but too large
2.0,Beware!  The product color choices are pink and purple.  I ordered pink and received blue.  (The picture shows blue but when the  choice was pink).  The color selections need to be corrected.
2.0,Purchased this for my 3 year old. First thing is that it is very tight when you first get it. I had a hard time stretching it to put on his head let alone him trying to get it on himself. Now after only having it a little over a month the covering over the ear cushion is coming off from the base. Looks like it's heals with a very light glue. I didn't give it 1 star because it did a good job at what it's meant to do and that's help protect my sons ears but I'm disappointed with the quality.
2.0,Very cheaply made... was nothing like the photo... not satisfied at all
2.0,I did not like the fabric.  Pants run small.
2.0,"This was very small - I cannot wear it on my neck as is. Thank goodness I do a lot of jewelry making, so I can add some loops to the end to make it wearable."
2.0,Way too large than my usual 'L' size.
2.0,"the material is almost thread bare, it looks really inexpensive.  I will not wear it out, it is a house dress at best!"
2.0,Runs small and does not flatter curves or fit them well
2.0,These rocks were too big to do the craft I bought them for. Upwards of 4‚Äù across.
2.0,The two pair I got were both black. I only received 2 pair.
2.0,Did not like @ all would not go on or stay on
2.0,I am missing the beaded necklace
2.0,I have to say I absolutely love this come on but I was a bit disappointed because if it's small and I went on size up just so I could fit perfectly but it did not so I ended up giving it to my mom she ended up loving
2.0,"The kit is great, but I have yet to receive the right size I ordered.  Twice I ordered the XS which would be perfect.  First I got a S, the tar one I got a M!!!  So frustrating!!!!"
2.0,"Warm, comfortable, good grip and ok looking. BUT, as some others wrote, the opening to put your feet through is way too small. I ordered a size too big, but 3 weeks in, and I have already ripped out the stitching on one of them. Too bad."
2.0,"The stones don't look anything like the picture, not blue almost clear."
2.0,There's a hole in the heal earlier than I would have expected.
2.0,It didn't fit very well and some of the sewing was off.
2.0,Zipper broke first time i put them on.
2.0,The belt gave it shape and the purple color was pretty. I wore a slip dress under it because I felt like it was pretty see through.
2.0,LOVE SHIRT - JUST A LITTLE SMALL
2.0,The fit was ok I am upset because the price went down four days after I ordered it
2.0,"These are certainly cute!  That's about the only positive thing I can say about them, other than they don't make your feet too hot, or fall down.  The EKG ones (the ones I'll probably never wear) definitely work the best, and it's INCREDIBLY DISSATISFYING that there is such a noticeable difference between the EKG ones, which feel like they're about 10 mmHG compaired to the super cute heart ones (the main reason I bought these), which feel about 2 mmHG, and the stripes, which feel about a 5 mmHG.<br /><br />If you want something cute that'll stay up, then these are the compression socks for you!  If you want compressions socks, I'd say pass on these,"
2.0,"cheap as expected, clasp kept coming off -.-"
2.0,The arm broke after about one month of use
2.0,Fell apart after first wash.  Good thing I had my son wore it before washing due to lack of time.
2.0,MUCH smaller than I anticipated
2.0,Would order big for washing this shirt shrunk up to my daughters size.
2.0,The dress looks nice from far away. But when you look closely you see just how poorly the dress was put together. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm keeping this. I do like the pockets and the feel of the material but other than that it‚Äôs of poor quality
2.0,"Was hoping to find a cute romper for my daughter.  This definitely did not fit her correctly.  She doesn't have a particularly long torso, but this romper was far too short for her torso.  The shorts portion fit well and were as expected.  We will be returning to find something that fits correctly."
2.0,This bag is very small. Just for girls. But looks pretty!
2.0,Cute but way too small for a large
2.0,Looks cute on but broke when I bent down to pick something up. Wear it if you're not going to be doing much moving.
2.0,"Don't get me wrong with my two stars. It looks as I expected it. It's pretty nice as the picture. But I just wore it not too long ago. About an hour doing my errands I just realized I lost it. So, two stars for not being secure and loose."
2.0,"Maybe my head is too big but the brim on this thing is tiny, probably fit my daughter's head"
2.0,"They look really good. But after 2 days of wear, the clasp on one of the necklaces is bent. I guess that's why you get 4"
2.0,Material not light.
2.0,I love the dress but the first time I tried it on the zipper broke.  I may buy it again because I like the style and will just not use the zipper next time.
2.0,"I knew to order larger than my normal size, and while the fit was fine, the material felt very cheap and I am returning it."
2.0,Bad oder and shoe fits to short at toe.
2.0,"I have finally figured this watch out.  But I should have paid attention to the other reviews.  Many said it was complicated and difficult to even set the time.  But Noooooo  I figured &#34;I'm a smart guy&#34;  &#34;I have had plenty of digital watches over the years&#34;  &#34;I can teach my 11 year old how to do this - no problem.&#34;  Well, I was wrong.  This thing is a nightmare to use!  Even setting the time requires careful review of the instructions and even then, it's done in such an illogical fashion, it is difficult to follow."
2.0,It wore out quick.
2.0,Terrible fabric quality
2.0,"It is frumpy on me, but I'm sure someone else would look nice in it."
2.0,"This hat is fine, but it cam pre bent in a VERY wonky way and can't be undone. Also, very large on our newborn."
2.0,"theres no way of sticking it on very cheaply made. Not as much hair as picture shows. Had to use eyelash glue to stick it, but it does do the job if you're looking for a fake hulk hogan costume."
2.0,The rings ‚Äúlook‚Äù nice. But I ordered size 20G and received 18G.<br />18G is bigger than 20G.
2.0,Very cute Nightgown and quality seemed fine.  he only issues was that it was not sized well.
2.0,Had to send back-was to small for my wrist
2.0,Very tight waistband. Shrunk after washing. Beautiful material.
2.0,"This hat has a super wide brim and I imagine it would be good sun protection, but it was either shallow or oddly shaped, so it didn't really want to sit on my head. Even with hair through the pony tail hole, it still wanted to ride up my forehead.  I could have exchanged for bigger size, but I wasn't sure that was the problem."
2.0,Way to small band doesn't unzip
2.0,Was smaller then the size ordered
2.0,This is my second time doing this review since my first one never did show up.  This is not swimwear ladies. It is not lined. Maybe you can wear it as underwear if that is your thing.
2.0,"I returned big-blue love the color, just too big and heavy  robbie"
2.0,Too tight and too far up your nose.
2.0,"These socks are NOT for thick thighs. These are misleading, was wayyyy too tight on my 22"" thighs. Supposed to fit up to 25""!<br />Super displeased!"
2.0,They are more for sports then everyday shopping and visiting.
2.0,2 buttons came off the first time I wore the shirt.  Only had one replacement.  For the price the button should last longer
2.0,"This sweatsuit is a very poor quality, runs small, and isn't comfortable. Not what I expected from the picture at all. I expected sweatshirt fabric, but this is thin, shiny on the outside, and a little rough on the inside. The tie dye also looks like it is printed on the fabric. The top is very short and the pants are very tight. The fabric doesn't have much give. If you buy definitely size up."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like the style of the dress
2.0,"The gathered top and stiff fabric made me look like an elephant. This skirt needs to be on someone very thin and straight up and down, with a small derriere. I returned it."
2.0,The white color of the material is yellowish and doesn't match the the trim very well.
2.0,velcro stopped working quickly
2.0,I washed this dress before wearing it and the hems came came off. The finishing is very poor. Not recommended.
2.0,I know they are cheap earrings but they didn‚Äôt last a week without breaking. Very cheaply made!
2.0,"I have a lower belly button piercing, it's a little short. and they do not glow in the dark."
2.0,"The body of the shirt fits, the sleeves are extremely tight, so disappointed."
2.0,Slip into my shoe.
2.0,No mengusto el forro osea la parte de adentro es el mismo largor del vestido y no luce igual a la foto para q se vea igual se tiene que cortar
2.0,The color is horrible.  Didn't expect too much for the price
2.0,Material is thin and looks cheap
2.0,Cute design and fit is fine but they are VERY see-through!
2.0,"Good for items that can be squashed up like clothes. But for anything else, not much space."
2.0,I cannot get over the smell and the material is so soft it is too slouchy and the feels almost sticky.  I will keep looking and probably give it as a gift.  Nice design though.  Also the zippers are not a smooth as i would like.
2.0,The fabric is very flimsy and See-through. After washing it came out very wrinkled.
2.0,Ok shirt but the sizes are a bit off The large was a bit too baggy. I'm Six four 205.
2.0,"Not sure if we received the wrong size or what, but we did not receive a normal 6-12 month. My daughter is on the smaller size, but I think 2 of her feet could fit in each shoe. They are HUGE! She's 11 months. Wish I would have ordered another size down, but I think they still would have been too big. They did come in quicker than expected and seem to be a good quality, but we won't get to wear them for a while."
2.0,These don't fit over my glasses any better than a lot of regular sun glasses
2.0,"It's very cute, but not leather"
2.0,Cute shirt but pineapple decal was put on poorly and was creased together.
2.0,Nice jacket......not wind proof at all!
2.0,Not as good as the one I got 3 yrs ago
2.0,The shirt looks nice but it didn't fit my daughter.  Even in a 3x it was too small for me who wears a L
2.0,Don't fit right to big for my face
2.0,Don't get wet turns color the next day
2.0,came with red stains around the hemline
2.0,"Pearls all varied sizes.  Two were really odd shaped and one had more consistent sized pearls.  I know it says ""off shape"", but with the included photo, it is very misleading."
2.0,"They‚Äôre so cute and small. However, they ripped so fast. ‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,"Cute dress, but the sash is a different color than the ribbon on the straps, which makes the whole thing look wonky."
2.0,The logos are crooked :/
2.0,Dress looks really cute; however the material looks really cheap and the dress is poorly made.  I was very disappointed; and returned it.
2.0,"I purchased these calf compressors for my daughter who is a sprinter and has shin splints. she said they do not provide the support she needs or the relief she was expecting.<br /> Even after putting two on one calf , the result was the same."
2.0,"This dress has a lot of room in the chest area so for someone like me who isn't very big in the chest, it didn't work at all.  The pleats in the front and back at the top of the skirt made the dress hang very awkwardly.  It's a beautiful dress and appears well made."
2.0,"This dress fit amazing! Hugs all the curves. So flattering. But the zipper broke, if that hadn‚Äôt happened this would be a 5 start review"
2.0,The material seems good but has little stretch to it.  The mask is too small so the chin pocket rides up when you talk.
2.0,"Product was inexpensive and looks that way. It looks different from the photo. It looks very much like a dark brass, like almost the color metal gets when it's tarnished and I could barely make the Cameo out which is sad because that was my favorite part! When it arrived the bow was off but thankfully it was just the ring that attached it too the bracelet got loose so I was able to reattach it. The good thing though is that it was sent to me quicker than it said it would come."
2.0,The nose piece is not secured. I can see the first time I wash this mask that the nose piece will poke out of the material.
2.0,"The fit is way too tight. In any other shirt I've bought, large is the right fit. I would recommend ordering one or possibly two sizes bigger than what you normally get."
2.0,The fabric is very thin. The size is more like a bandana than a scarf.
2.0,"I have been wearing Pearl Izumi bike shorts and gloves for 10 years.  Expensive, but top quality.  This brand is what you get when you don""t want to spend the money.  Low quality, poor fit.  Wouldn't buy again."
2.0,"I really wanted to make this work (shirts like this are hard to find!), but couldn't. I'm 5'0&#34;, 113 lbs and usually wear a small or XS. The medium was so tight it showed every bump or ripple, super unflattering. I ordered the large, and the neck gaped and hung, while the torso was still way too snug but the arms were too long and the shirt hung to my knees."
2.0,"These are made from a mold so they still have plastic on them from where they were attached. You'll need to use scissors, or sandpaper, or a nail file to smooth them so they don't poke you. The small fixture they have to attach them to your mask doesn't work. Basically you have to use the pressure of your mask to hold it in place."
2.0,If almost started to corrode immediately and the opal drop pendent caught on everything. I ended up having to use a new double/split ring to keep it attached.
2.0,The photo shows a deeper purple than what it really is.
2.0,"The jeans were sewed badly and unfinished, looked like girl jeans, waste of money, but I did learn my lesson about ordering them through this, never again. Shirt was to small"
2.0,"I am really hoping I learn my lesson about ordering clothes from sources with whom I am not familiar off the internet. It has not worked out well for me, but I tend to forget this every 6 months or so and here we are...<br /><br />The knit is okay,  and the fit is okay, even though I really do not like a band around the bottom of a sweater. The BIG problem is, I feel like I am choking due to the tightness of the neck. It's a mock turtleneck, but it's probably at least 2 inches smaller than it should be, and I feel like I am going to die when I put it on.<br /><br />I am never wearing this. If you have a particularly thin neck, this may be fine for you."
2.0,"I should have read reviews before I placed this order. It's cute, but way too big! I ordered a newborn. Our newborn granddaughter could fit her entire body in one leg! Haha!<br />We will be returning this item."
2.0,"I have a love-hate relationship with this skirt. It's cute, but it's constantly falling apart. When I got it, there were stray strands of thread everywhere, parts of the skirt were not sewn, and I had to sew it up myself. Since then, every time I wear it, some other part of it comes apart and has to be sewn again. It's cheap and not very well made. Unless you're willing to keep up with the repairs, I'd recommend springing for one of the more expensive options that might be better made, or making your own."
2.0,Super cool thought! Bought for my niece and one of the socks was totally falling apart. Can‚Äôt return it because she loved it. Sad and disappointed. $30 for 12 socks and she can‚Äôt wear a pair of them. Contacted the seller about the issue was told to contact Amazon.
2.0,Pretty design given but doesn't change colors and if you look in my picture you will see the two white oops in the ring (that's not a glare) it looks like just a bad cut sticker
2.0,The print is super nice but its so thin it's not worth it. I know you are paying for the print on sweatshirts like this but I have t-shirts that are thicker.
2.0,I ordered a small and it fit like a large
2.0,No way this is made for a 2X male. The shirts are so small and tight and short.
2.0,"I bought the white dress in S. Notes below:<br /><br />FABRIC<br />VERY elastic cheap fabric, similar to a bathing suit, which is nothing like the fabric picture they present. Also, it is very see-through.<br />FITTING<br />I altered it to fit my 5'2"" height (cut the back straps to make them shorter) and sewed a lining (which was of better fabric, how sad...)<br />DESIGN<br />Nice design but if you are busty, perhaps it would be too revealing. I am 28E and it was sexy but decent.<br />SUMMARY<br />I do not recommend this particular dress in this colour (white) because of the material. Perhaps in black or other dark colours it would be not so bad. I had to buy another dress (from Ever-Pretty) and give this one away."
2.0,Fabric is sort of shiny and just no good!
2.0,"It's cute, was packaged well and arrived promptly but the tie closure fell apart when I attempted to untie it to try it on...you get what you pay for!"
2.0,I love Nike it's my favorite brand and for this reason only I couldn't bring myself to give this one star. It doesn't fit right at all the material is weird. I really don't like it. I was very disappointed usually Nike is way higher quality than this. The only redeeming quality is the color.
2.0,Was pretty and didn‚Äôt bother my skin but the diamonds that hung down broke off after a week
2.0,Sent back. Hat is perfectly fine but Too large for my head.
2.0,They are cute... but at different angles the lens look weird. In some photos one lens was shining and the other was black--looked like I was wearing an eye patch. Not cute....
2.0,"Very hard to adjust. Both ends of the strap are magnetic so once it‚Äôs on, it‚Äôs very hard to remove. I struggled with not getting it. Snagged on items. Not so good."
2.0,Quality poor. Nothing.body flattering.<br />The dress was true Forrest green. Only reason it gets a 2
2.0,Cute but fell apart after washing twice (no dryer).
2.0,Not true to size. Runs small- this 3x is a 1x
2.0,this looks very different from the picture
2.0,I bought 2 sizes larger than I wear and it was too small
2.0,Dress was longer then in pictures super thick
2.0,very low quality.
2.0,"I couldn't believe how beautiful this necklace was! It was wrapped in plastic, but when I took the plastic off, one of the stones already fell off. I have a message into the seller to try to rectify my situation. If I have any updates, I'll let you know."
2.0,"I wore one the first day and a week later I'm still having pain from wearing it. I know it needs more time but i had to send it back for a diff size.<br />I don't like that the black one came with a bright yellow company name tag stitched in. I hate wearing clothes that advertise. üôÑ Also,  you can't tell from the picture, but the leopard one has fabric with a nap, and if they don't pay attention,  your shoes could look like they don't match.  Sent that one back but they sent another pair that the naps don't match. I'm going to give at least one pair a good try and see if I have improvement for achilles tendonitis and plantars fasciitis."
2.0,"I am 6-2 inches tall nd lean, and the large/extra large are too snug.  So small that there is zero air pocket inside the glove to keep my hands warm.  I gave them to my middle school son."
2.0,Good thing we only needed it for a costume because it pretty much fell apart after day 1.
2.0,It is VERY cheaply made.
2.0,"Very disappointed! I did receive 10 pieces, but many of them were duplicate!!"
2.0,chain broke 1st day
2.0,But the shorts had a little hole in it.
2.0,Very thin cheap material. It looks like they took a full pair of pants and just cut below the knee. I‚Äôm disappointed. I was so excited for these. They also run a little smaller than it said.
2.0,The ring is not like in the picture i am disappointed
2.0,"The material is soft, but they start riding-up almost immediately after putting them on. For work, I walk 3-5 miles per day and also spend a good amount of time in an office chair. Me: (generally) fit, 5'11."
2.0,It runs small! Cute dress though. For the $ I'll give it to a friend- not worth sending it back...
2.0,Turned out small so it was tight. Bought large but guess XL would have been my best pick even though I usually do large. Sewing was poor with threads sticking out and quality certainly not like I expected.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,Was great for the first wear. After one wash is more appropriate for a child. Not impressed.
2.0,The item Was too small and the quality of the materials cheap. I ordered an extra large and it was still too small. Chest size is a 38 DD.  I return the item to the manufacture. Return process was simple
2.0,The length is not as long as I expected and as same as picture showing even though I have a short body part already. I am 5'4&#34; with 120 lbs.
2.0,"The dress was pretty in the pictures, but I must be the completely wrong body type... First, it was VERY small, and it looked very odd on me.  I‚Äôm probably too short (5‚Äô5‚Äù) to make it work. I needed to return it."
2.0,These were wayyyy to small. I am 5‚Äô3 185 lbs and I got a 2x because I like looser fitting clothing... these things are skin tights. Not happy. If you‚Äôre going to order these.... GO WAY BIGGER.
2.0,These bras say they are wire free but they have some plastic boning in the sides that make them uncomfortable. I also wish they offered an extra small and more padding. I bought several and wish I hadn‚Äôt.
2.0,Would be cute if you could read the writing.
2.0,I loved these at first. They were soft and comfortable. But after wearing them for a while they pilled terribly. I've never had a pair of leggings do this before.
2.0,I purchased this watch on their website. It is a bit difficult to reset the minute hand to start the timer. My nails are short which made the pin hard to pull out...maybe its easier for others with longer nails. Does the job of timing if you can set it correct though.
2.0,It's cute but you can't wear the charm on a daily basis because it starts to fade from the silver look to the bronze underneath it. Wouldn't have bought it if I would have known this.
2.0,"I ordered an X-small but i received a Large size.  The fabric is not as good, good enough for the price you pay for.  Sending an incorrect size is not acceptable."
2.0,cheap and the color was awful!!! wasted 14.99
2.0,Fabric not what I expected
2.0,This shoe got torn and busted after two weeks
2.0,This is just ok
2.0,the copper color is cheesy
2.0,I requested one size up and still too small. Products made in China are usually two or three sizes smaller. Will make sure not to buy anything made there in the future.
2.0,"Little stones fell out within a week of having them.  I was wearing them all the time... while I slept too.... so apparently it was just too much for the little cheap earrings.  I love the huggie type earrings, but beware of the quality!!"
2.0,The material is nice and soft but after one wash the nightgown always sits crooked. The buttons go down diagonally instead of in a straight line. The buttons also are not as convenient for nursing as I would have liked.
2.0,More like a big box store athletic top than a running bra.
2.0,WAY too small. Couldn't wear..
2.0,"This isn't a purse, it's an overnight bag.  The pockets inside it are tiny in comparison to the actual size of the bag.  It also has a horrific odor that is nauseating.  And the shoulder strap isn't even the same color as the purse itself.  The only positive is that I like the distressed look and the seaming on the outside."
2.0,I love the design! But the shirt was a little snug and there is a home in the inside seam of the left leg.
2.0,They work but I can‚Äôt get my twins to wear them because they hurt their ears and head while wearing
2.0,"Colors were much, much brighter than those in the photo. I didn't try them on since they are not what I was looking for."
2.0,"Ring is really pretty but it‚Äôs WAY to big to be a toe ring.  It‚Äôs advertised as a toe ring, I bought it for my toe, wanted it for my toe, doesn‚Äôt fit my toe.  Who has thumb sized toes?  It fits my thumb."
2.0,"if you are petite id stay away, it runs huge and XS was still large, I wear a 4 mostly and I'm 5'2... this made me look like a sack of potatoes and I actually have a nice physic... so not for me"
2.0,The slit is in the center and comes up much too high for my taste. The color and fabric are nice enough. I just can‚Äôt make this dress work due to how it‚Äôs cut.
2.0,These do not stick to your head at all. They are open in a way that doesn‚Äôt allow them to suction to your head in any way at all. Don‚Äôt waste your money
2.0,"I love the pattern of these pants. Very vibrant and fun. The material is rather cheap, but given the price, worth keeping if it fits. The length was appropriate, however the waist was very high, and the overall circumference of the legs was too tight for me. On average. 5‚Äô2‚Äù.  About 125 pounds. Much heavier than I used to be. If you have thin legs or are skinny, I think you‚Äôd like these‚Ä¶ But I have to return them"
2.0,It had a hole in it.
2.0,The colors are very vibrant the fabric was as expected but it was a bit small I had to return it
2.0,flimsy post that bends off the angel wings and can easily snap - wore them once and now they sit on a jewelry stand.
2.0,one stem was bent. I straightened it but still not perfect.
2.0,the quality isn't great and the colors are much brighter in the picture.
2.0,"I didn't like it and returned it the same day. The handles were really short which they didn't seem from the pictures. The color was also not as in the picture. It was just not what I expected, but then it's always a gamble when you buy something online that you have not seen before."
2.0,nice but too small...gave it away.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this watch, it did look beautiful however there was a painting defect on the hour hand.  It goes along with what others have said, poor quality control."
2.0,"No complaints about the seller and their shipping, but the pin was poorly affixed to the back and is at an angle."
2.0,"Bow pretty much fell apart the first time I put it on. I gave it two stars because the elastic part is good, the fastner is good - they should make the bow out of elastic or fabric as well.  All in all I got what I paid $7 for."
2.0,"When I tried this on, it technically fit about how I expected to, but the material felt like a cheap prom dress (or a dress a little girl would use to play dress-up). I immediately took it off and started the return process."
2.0,"These are cool looking and super inexpensive, but overall the quality was just too poor. The screws fall out very easily, in fact one pair was missing a screw upon arrival. These glasses also have a thin plastic coating that began to bubble up and peel off after a short time. Would not buy again."
2.0,Size runs larger
2.0,"Overall length was too long, so it needed to be cut down. The problem is once that is done and if the cut is not  PERFECT, not enough material can be grabbed by the teeth of the holding mechanism. Also this should have been moved/redesign so the pull of the belt makes the connection tighter, instead when the belt is pulled it'll unfasten the teeth mechanism."
2.0,"Pretty but heavy too heavy had to return. Disappointed, big size"
2.0,I found the fabric a bit flimsy. I returned the dress.
2.0,"I like that I can fit my lunch, laptop, water bottle, pens/pencils, wallet and find everything without rummaging.  Small caveats, the shoulder straps are not long and I have to store my laptop so that it sticks out, but to me these are not deal breakers.  The bag material is very good quality.  However, all the clasps keep breaking off while carrying and then plus snagging my sweaters.  I have had 3 ruined shirts that have snags from the clasps.  I like the product wish the clasps were better quality so they don't come undone when carrying and snagging my shirts."
2.0,"Was meant to be a costume, but the fit was goofy.  Pants were fine.  Jacket was ok around the chest, but I could barely fit my arms in and I am someone described as wiry in the arms - in no way muscular."
2.0,"The device arrived with a low battery charge. When I tried to set it up the battery died completely. Yes, I know I could have gone to a jeweler and had a battery installed. But, dammit, I have other things to do. I really don't need to be fooled into what my probable life-span will be. God determines that anyway."
2.0,I didn't like that there wasn't any kind of breast support. Tried to find something that was cute being a new mom.
2.0,"I am sad. Overall, I like this dress. It fits a little smaller than a medium normally would but it works. However, it has these weird pockets or something of fabric near the bottom of the dress... it just looks really strange when you try to wear it. I am not sure what they were thinking when they made it. I will be returning."
2.0,"Not really a fan. I wanted to like them but I just dont.  They're not the best looking pair of shoes on the market and plus, one of the eyelets for my shoelaces broke already. They are inexpensive. Not too comfortable but not totally uncomfortable either. I'm not buying another pair. I'll say it like tha"
2.0,poor quality material and wrinkles easily
2.0,The socks are very nice except one was shipped with a hole in the top of it and I had to return it.
2.0,"I wanted the sister one instead i got a Mother Bracelet it was a cmas gift and my sister opened it i guess i had to tell her she was like my mom but she loved it yet, so wrong to do ! !! Totally unacceptable!"
2.0,see through and runs small
2.0,Peplum sits in a weird place and didn't fit my short torso / big breasted body. Tie dye was cute as pictured but the fit didn't work for me. I returned it.
2.0,Wanted this dress to work. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 142lbs brought a medium. So I love the way it hugs my curves but when I put it on it felt like the side seem by the zipper could break and leave my bare body exposed and embarrassed at work. The white stitching is cheap it‚Äôs exposed and fragile.
2.0,"I love travel and snorkel, and those bags are a savers to keep money, phone, etc. dry. I order them to share with my husband and sister, but one of them come with a broken piece and the quality is not as other ones I'd have been order in the pass."
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture when on. It was kind of loose around the top.
2.0,"When I discovered Sugar flip flops about 5 years ago, I was really pleased. I had bruised metatarsals and was having difficulty walking barefoot on my hardwood floors. The sugars were  a great solution for me and I bought numerous pairs throughout the years. I would say the cushion in this pair is less that half of what they once had. I am disappointed because I still need to baby my feet."
2.0,"These are very cute, as depicted. The colors are bright and the rhinestones eye catching. They actually looked better in person than in the photo. However, they are very fragile. 5 out of the 7 I ordered broke as they were being unpacked or as they were being tried on for the first time. They are very cute and fun earrings, but you get what you pay for in quality, so have some craft glue on hand. I gave them as gifts at a party and when I found out they had broken, I was embarrassed."
2.0,"The design immediately wrinkled after one wash and I bought it quite a while ago, so it‚Äôs been getting worse ever since. I wear it as a pajama shirt, so kind of a waste of money."
2.0,"To hard, didn't like at all."
2.0,It‚Äôs very small but it‚Äôs cute and  comfortable  To wear.
2.0,"It's a little small and while the material feels really nice, it just didn't look right. Returning it."
2.0,Bad quallity
2.0,To small for a shirt chain
2.0,"Look good, but don't last.  I've worn them on hiking/working shoes, which means they are not used that much (I'm retired).  Not worth the money."
2.0,too small and tangles
2.0,The watch arrived with a dead battery.
2.0,Go to Goodwill and buy a tie.  These are poor quality.  The red tie is actually more of a wine color.
2.0,"The shirt looks nice on the model, but if you have a chest, it's going to not fit your body. The material isn't stretchy either. Quite hard to put on and take off. Not worth buying."
2.0,Fabric is weird!! Not what I expected from the picture. But I did not look at details on fabric used so that's my bad.  I'm returning since the fabric is a no go for me.
2.0,"I purchased expecting something of a reasonable weight...I was wrong.  What I got was VERY thin and felt cheap.  The lettering on mine was hardly readable because the background was tarnished (that I fixed with a polishing cloth).  Perhaps for the price I had higher epectations than I should have, but I was just not impressed."
2.0,"My husband purchased this coat for our 7 year old who picked it out and absolutely adored it. The liner is nice, the material of the shell feels cheap to me. I'm sure it would rip easily and probably will when she wears it to snowboard. After a month, maybe less of wearing it as her everyday jacket, one of the hand pocket zippers is completely broke. the main zipper is a pain too and looks as if its on its way to breaking. She can no longer zipper her jacket by herself because it's that difficult. The breast pocket is also a faux pocket(another disappointment), but the zipper functions. I would have rather spent the extra $20 and bought her another Columbia or NorthFace jacket like the one she had that lasted for years and is still going strong on my niece since my daughter outgrew it."
2.0,"Disappointed in this product.  The dress is cute, but very cheap... it's practically see-through and super short.  I ordered a Medium.  I'm average height (5' 7"") and it barely touches my mid-thigh when standing."
2.0,Way shorter than the picture.
2.0,It didn't fit as expected.
2.0,I was unimpressed with the quality of the material.
2.0,These are not boot socks. They are very thin and too big for my feet. I wear size 5. They'd be best for an 8 but not a 5. If you're looking for warmth look elsewhere
2.0,Stitching on a couple of the fingers came undone within a few weeks. I shouldn't have to repair something that's brand new.
2.0,Not quality material or construction.
2.0,"I've tried many inexpensive reading glasses, and I liked the idea of these - folding and thus easy to keep around in a few places like my car, etc.<br />These glasses are pretty clunky - they're relatively heavy and boy are they ugly!  I will definitely never wear these, but I am not returning them because the little cases they come with are kinda handy!<br />Look elsewhere if you care about how they feel and look."
2.0,Ugh is all I can say
2.0,"So this thing fit, but it's a generic costume. It looks like the sort of suit you'd wear if you knew that you were already going to lose your case in court."
2.0,"very comfortable, but stitching is already coming off after just a few months.....made the mistake of ordering a 2nd pair after I had the 1st pair for a week.  It's probably a design flaw or cheap threading.  disappointed!  Will take it to a shoe maker, but repair may be more than just another pair."
2.0,There is nothing wrong with the item except the size is really large and you only get one (black). I returned the item as I really wanted the green on and I will not wear it as it is way too large.
2.0,"I initially liked the bag a lot. The price was great and it looked pretty good. But after just 3.5 months of use, it started to fall apart. The inner lining ripped away from the canvas exterior and the zipper started getting completely stuck. Now the zipper doesnt actually zip at all. It runs along the track but leaves zipper threads totally open behind it. Definitely a lesson in &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Didn't expect a $30 bag to last a lifetime, but hoped it would hold up a little longer than it did."
2.0,This was a gift and the spyglass pendant was larger than expected<br />and the chain was cheap--it was actually broke when received<br />in the mail.  I had to buy a new chain at the last minute to give as a<br />gift.
2.0,"I thought these were bulky in the toe area and they looked odd. Also, the tounge wouldn't fold down. They look cheap too."
2.0,Advertisement said the item was men's gloves. However the gloves were so small it did not fit my wife. Packaging did not reflect a size.
2.0,The band is hard to close. Tends to become unhooked. My girlfriend lost hers because of it.
2.0,Had to return- bought for my son but fabric so thin it‚Äôs see through.
2.0,"I loved it, but I broke after only wearing it for 3 days. It was tugged or anything it just snapped while I was walking. Bummed because I got a lot of compliments on it."
2.0,They r super cute but too big:( the waist falls down
2.0,"I was very disappointed. The description of the item read ‚Äústerling silver‚Äù, however the item appears, to me, to be sterling plated on the back of the medal."
2.0,I either didn‚Äôt read the description correctly or the description was misleading. I did t realize the pockets were in the shirts and not the skirt. I won‚Äôt use the pockets now because I don‚Äôt want to lift the skirt to get to them ü•≤
2.0,"This was the third (replacement) necklace I ordered. They were all very nice, but the spring clasp didn't &#34;spring&#34; back very well on any of them. I kept it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back a third time. I will just be extra careful to ensure the clasp is completely closed when I wear it so I don't lose my beautiful pendent."
2.0,They are beautiful but poorly constructed. The post immediately bent.
2.0,"Their measurements don't make sense. I have a 31&#34; waist after having my baby, but generally wear a 4/6 in jeans &pants. I went with a medium &on the smallest hinge, it feels loose. If sizing were accurate, I'd be happy. Seems to be of good quality &well made. Will be returning."
2.0,"This shirt isn't made well, looks slightly ridiculous, and simply isn't worth the money. The neck is so large is almost feels like a woman's off the shoulder top. The color is nice, and they had the right idea, but in a practical sense, this shirt just isn't going to work."
2.0,"Although it looks gorgeous and I absolutely adored it for the first day... I wore it for a couple hours with minimum wear-and-tear (I mostly sat around with it on, no real jostling or it catching on anything), and replaced it into the box afterwards.  Yet, the next time I pulled it out of said box and put it on, it broke - a gear falling off.  I might have considered gluing it back on, myself, but honestly it just wasn't up to par in general.  The makeup of it is essentially a half-cast mold, meaning that you don't want anyone to see the other side of it if you can help it, and the chain is a basic dog-tags chain... which is to be expected from the picture, except it is cheaper than your average chain of this variety.  It's stiff, making bending it at all uncomfortable, and I honestly switched it out for a different dog-tag chain that I had laying around.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I would recommend this for anyone that doesn't mind these issues because it is gorgeous on the front.  Just keep in mind the other potential issues I mentioned."
2.0,Sad.  The first time I put it on the neck ripped.  I love the shirt but can‚Äôt wear it now as it‚Äôs ripped.  The neck hole is super small.
2.0,"For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and have a 38‚Äù rack and this dress gaped on both sides. I ordered an xl because I wanted a baggy fit, but this was huge on me. The fabric is definitely not what it looks like in the picture and is a silky synthetic of some type.  It was also oddly long, coming down to my knees. I‚Äôm guessing the sizes are inconsistent at best."
2.0,The elastic came off on certain area I had to sew it.
2.0,Cute and cheap<br />Cute but only good for phone and Id do not overload chain strap will break
2.0,I went for a size L because I am 6' tall but it was still way to short in the torso for comfort. An XL would have been too big for the rest of my body type.
2.0,Too small. In accurate description.
2.0,Did not fit very well and it has cheap material.  I would not buy this again.
2.0,One of the earrings broke immediately upon trying the pair of earrings.
2.0,We purchase Brooks all of the time for our High Schooler Cross Country runner. This particular pair runs small.
2.0,"These are nice gloves, but the touch sensors do not work.<br /><br />I accidentally ordered two pairs; I don't complain, they are quite nice for the category of glove that they are; warm and snug, with a quality and cute knit & color aesthetic.<br /><br />When I need to access my phone, it's worth a shot, but it's a fool's errand to utilize their smartphone while depending on wearing these with their gloved & index fingers. When out, mine are often untucked."
2.0,way to small would fit a child
2.0,Didn't really like the material
2.0,"I ordered a small , going by the suggestion, from my arm it fits good , HOWEVER from the elastic end it is way too tight. A medium would have been better , but wonder if from arm it will fit like this small one ... seller should provide a better fit."
2.0,I have to return it
2.0,"Top is tight, skirt is long."
2.0,Not a dress at all. It a shirt really.
2.0,Muy hermoso pero es peque√±o para la talla L que compre.
2.0,"In the picture, the bottom part of the blouse seems to be loose, it looks like a )( shape.<br />In reality, it is tighter in the bottom, it has a \/ shape."
2.0,Super small!!!
2.0,"Very cute, but not right for the upper parts of my body. It also fit a bit longer on my short body than I liked.  That's all relative though.  Overall, I really liked the dress!"
2.0,"This shirt is listed as &quot;one size.&quot;  I typically wear a size 0-2.  My waist is 25 inches, hips about 31-32 inches, bust 32 inches.  The shirt fit, but not in a flattering way.  It was extremely awkward looking.  No graceful drape, just hip hugging and looking like it &quot;just fit.&quot;  I am a rather small person, so I don't know for whom this is &quot;one size.&quot;  If you are a size 4 or above, I can pretty much assure you that the &quot;one size&quot; will be too small. If you are a 0-2, it'll fit, but look weird. It is a pretty shirt, although the fabric is not the greatest--it added to the overall &quot;blah&quot; of the fit.  Sending it back, unfortunately."
2.0,"This item works fine.  Got it as a request for one of the members of our church as a high school graduation gift.  &#34;Again&#34;  it was her request which she is totally pleased with.  Came on time, sooner that expected."
2.0,"This dress is surprisingly really hot and heavy. On that note, because it is double lined it is not seethru which many dresses like this in linen or so seem to be see through. So I guess there is that. Not very flattering I guess unless you're a bean pole. I'm short and curvy so just not that great. Certainly cant wear it comfortably in the summer heat which is the reason I purchased it. *shrug*."
2.0,Very cute but Break very easily with gentle handling.
2.0,Completely see through in the back and the chest area would not stay in place correctly plus material looked and felt cheap
2.0,"Doesn't feel good, cheap fabric."
2.0,"I thought these would be very nice conservative reading glasses, but the frames are so thick that I look like Harry Caray when I wear them.<br />The photo really didn't convey that as well as I wished."
2.0,"I liked colors, I did not like fit; material was too stretchy for bra with little support"
2.0,"It broke the first time I took it off, and I was not rough with it nor have big wrists. But I‚Äôll give it 2 stars because it was really pretty and I really liked it up until it broke."
2.0,"Cute, but cheaply made - ended up returning."
2.0,"They ripped by the pocket almost immediately after I received them. Pocket placement is also a little awkward if you plan on putting anything in them. Price is okay, but I thought they would hold together a bit longer..."
2.0,I returned this dress.
2.0,The blue version of this dress looks so pretty but this one is not great. The pattern is kind of unflattering and the overall fit is kind of like a sack. The material is lightweight and it's easy to throw on and comfortable but I can't ever see myself really wearing this out. I do like the fact that it has a drawstring around the waist but I'm overall not impressed.
2.0,I'm tall (5'10) but this literally fits like a shirt :/
2.0,"Ok, not the quality o expect it."
2.0,"Wonky neckline.  This is the reason I limited my stars.  It is soft and cuddly, but the quilting gives it a strange neckline, if you want to not have it snapped all the way; which I did.  The navy was cute but gave it away after first wearing."
2.0,"Came in a nice case, glasses were in good shape, looked terrible on. They are for a HUGE face definitely don't order if your face is narrow"
2.0,Ordered medium but it looks like a large and the tag was ripped off. So I have no washing instructions or a way of verifying if it is actually a medium. The color and design is great but not very satisfied with this purchase.
2.0,Material is not structured like the picture. Thin and cheap looking.
2.0,"This top runs very, very small. I am 5'6""  and 165 lbs.  The largest size available lacked about 10"" coming together to attempt to zip.  The top also had a very strong chemical smell.  Had to return."
2.0,Much shorter than the average undershirt.
2.0,I like the band fabric that's about it.. the band is stiff and hard to adjust the band around the wrist..rubber bands are easier to adjust and has more adjustments
2.0,"I bought my size... but it is more tight then other brands. Also the cotton is not as soft.. it is one of those more &#34;rougher&#34; cotton. It is tolerable... but I would prefer a better, not so &#34;constricting&#34; fit"
2.0,Says 5x fits like 2x maybe 3x. Cute color though
2.0,"Stretches out a little which makes it hard to keep on. Color fades a little, the material starts to create lint balls"
2.0,"So I got myself so excited because everyone's booty looked amazing in these from the reviews, LOL I try them on and it doesn't really look that much different. I know if you want a big butt you have to work out, which Im doing. I did get these because I thought they'd help shape my figure more, but it didn't really show that much of a difference. The leggings itself are not comfortable. I like super soft leggings, the design in the pants don't feel good. They look tiny but they fit once they are on"
2.0,"Only reason I give it 2 stars is because the fabric is nice. Otherwise, VERY unhappy. WAY too small. If you have bigger boobs, there's no way this'll fit. I'm a 36DD and I ordered a large, thinking this will be a normal crop top... This thing is basically a see-through bra. It goes all the way up to my mid-torso and I can see my bra through it. Definatly not buying again. :)"
2.0,My wife never wears them :(
2.0,"It's gorgeous, and my gecko-loving niece of 15yrs LOVED the look/idea, but it had a cheap, flimsy post (which I didn't know would even be there) to supposedly fit into a pierced ear hole in the earlobe, and it fell off upon opening the package.  I had though it was just supposed to hang over the ear.  Since the post broke off, we had no other choice BUT to hang it on her ear, which then took bending to manipulate it enough so that it would stay put.  It only moderately worked."
2.0,"The pattern is beautiful, design was nice but  very short dress.  After I washed it, it shrank making it shorter. Material is thin making it almost see through, im 5'7, 125lbs, 38 bust and a Med was almost to tight around bust, can only wear with a pair of shorts under it"
2.0,"Warm nice coat, but zipper is so cheap it will not glide up and down easily. No zipper not warm coat..."
2.0,It kind of feels more like a cheap costume type of material rather than a soft/silk pj material for sleeping in. Still cute though
2.0,Not fleece lined. No zipper pockets. Just not as described.
2.0,"Unfortunately some of these arrived ON, and out of 40, 7 were already dead or never worked."
2.0,"The set is cute, yet the bracelet fell apart while on my arm. Low quality but cute."
2.0,"Very well made and of good material, unfortunatly the only way you could possibly get a good fit is if you are a specific shape (big chest and no waist). No options for people who would fit 46/46 (stick shape) and for sure there are 0 options for small chest and big waist.<br /><br />They really should have different select boxes for the chest and waist measurements, otherwise you have to fit their options perfectly or order the same outfit twice with the right sizes."
2.0,didn‚Äôt come with the glue.
2.0,Beautiful but caught on things in the inside of finger when grabbing or brushing up against fabric.  It was a bit tight.
2.0,"The blouse is not chiffon, it is not a good quality fabric its the cheap polyester. Returned it."
2.0,A lot smaller then I imagined even though there adjustable there still very small
2.0,"I‚Äôm over weight, 5‚Äô3‚Äù, 162, so we know that doesn‚Äôt help. BUT, I bought a large and OMG, so miserable to get into, seriously tight. This is truly meant for a larger women with NO extra weight. I would normally buy medium, 36D, but I‚Äôm up about 25 lbs over my real Norma weight due injuries and healing. But that being said, this still would not be a good fit, there is no room for flaws. Really great design and nice material for the price, but make sure you buy a supine up and have not a little bulge anywhere."
2.0,Material not reyon
2.0,Purse is in great quality... but I am trying to figure out how I was charged $29 for a purse with this pricetag... not cool.
2.0,"Ordered a small and was sent a large. Don't want to hassle with the post office and sending it back with everything that is going on (COVID). They are lightweight and comfortable but because of the size, they are not flattering on me. I gave them to my sister."
2.0,Product fits like Medium and not xl
2.0,"I want to love these, but I can‚Äôt.  I‚Äôve tried all kinds of backs on them and they just won‚Äôt stay in my ears.  It is soo aggravating.  They are also a little big.  I like big earrings, but these stick out too far somehow."
2.0,So adorable but they run very small had to return total bummer
2.0,Item returned.  Did not have the look desired.
2.0,The diamonds on the front fell off within a week of using them.
2.0,Sadly had to return because it would not stay in place.  So darn cute though!
2.0,It's a nice smapl wallet that can fit in your pocket but about 2 weeks in it is already showing signs of falling apart. The zipper sticks hard since i received it as well
2.0,"Four hours of wear, and I was treated to a giant hole. Disappointing, because I loved them otherwise."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:c44512347c10bd85b9d62f0707654014]] I like the color and design. But and big but....tell me how can I get this off my watch without damaging anything!? I tried for an hour and had no success so beware if you buy this and think you can easily switch your band like the actual band it came with.. which had a round lever to release it this one does not! And just because of that I'm extremely disappointed.
2.0,Seams/hems came apart in the washing machine. On delicate cycle too
2.0,Material not thick like a good quality legging. Spandex type legging w no support.
2.0,"I was excited for this pajama set. I‚Äôm sort of a jammie junkie. Jammies and lingerie are my ish. But this set fit awkwardly. The top was wide, tight, and short as heck. Sadly I returned."
2.0,It's a ok shirt but XL is small.
2.0,"Mostly made of plastic , including the hinges. Poor quality."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like fabric or how it looked
2.0,It‚Äôs cute but popped way too easily
2.0,Stem fell off and was lost. No directions for adjusting wristband.
2.0,the gold looks fake but if you just want something to wear that is different and its just a saturday with the girls okay but will not pass as something real
2.0,La calidad no me gusto
2.0,It fit but the seams were not well done. The fabric is stretchy and thin but doesn't seem like it would hold its shape well. The button holes are not sewn and seem like they will eventually start becoming bigger holes and wont hold the buttons.
2.0,its fake
2.0,"Color was nice. Durability, nope. First time dropped it broke and scratched the phone."
2.0,I made the mistake of not reading reviews prior to ordering. I‚Äôm not sure I will be able to get this hat wearable. It us so creased and misshapen. I tried misting with no success. I will try steam next.<br /><br />I will most likely have to return them.
2.0,What was given for fitting did not match the actual fit
2.0,Dose not work for me did help with back pain though
2.0,the rubber broke right away
2.0,"Nice bracelets, one of the three broke within the first wearing. Contacted the vendor and did not receive a response. Very disappointed."
2.0,Super cheap looks like a sticker
2.0,Glasses are very comfortable and fit nice. Which makes them all the more disappointing.  The whole lens is magnified.  I can't walk around with these on.  The whole point of safety goggles during COVID is to put them on and not touch them with my hands. Will be returning
2.0,This is a bit longer than I thought it would be. It fits fine but the material seems pretty thin and cheap. Probably good for warmer weather.
2.0,"These earrings are beautiful.  Unfortunately,  2 stones fell out; I then got a replacement.  This time one stone fell out. And I haven't worn these earrings yet!!"
2.0,Broke after 6 weeks.
2.0,I ordered ‚Äú‚Äùapricot‚Äù in the picture it looks much more yellow but when it came it looked like a cream/ beige color. I had to double check the label to make sure they sent me the correct one and they did. Color is just not accurate at all. Fabric has no stretch at all. Not in arms or torso. Returned
2.0,Very thin and sheer.
2.0,Slightly disappointed in the quality of this item
2.0,Not empressed
2.0,Way too small for an adult
2.0,"Came on time. Looks cheap, understandably no lighter fluid in it. Haven't tried to put any in to see if it would even work because I would never wear it with how it looks. I guess it does look like the picture. Overall, my dissatisfaction is my fault for forgetting to check the reviews."
2.0,"I understand that its a cheap watch but does it have to look that way,"
2.0,Weird cut for average women...maybe good for a super thin model but other women will look weird depending on your body...returned.
2.0,"These are cute, however they run a little larger than what is described, and the velcro on the sides are poorly put on and have already ripped off the side of the boot after being worn once."
2.0,This is very cute but the points kept stabbing and scraping my ear. I couldn't wear it long.
2.0,The watch looks nice but the belt with the stitching does not match well. The overall watch is very heavy and the numbers are bigger than they look in the picture
2.0,Does not look like the picture. Will maybe refashion
2.0,I like them but they're way to big. I'm a size 9 but those shoes fit like a size 10.  I'm naturally very disappointed.
2.0,Some of the do not come apart correctly.
2.0,This dress does not come with the petticoat as pictured.  I returned it because I'd have to buy the petticoat to make it look more like the 60's.
2.0,"Scarf is as shown in picture,  but couldn't find any label showing made from silk, does not feel like silk, neither."
2.0,This was not the same as in any pictures. Very disappointing. There are no black straps as portrayed in the pictures. And the patches are not real. Just images on the jumpsuit. Will bot order from this company again. And I'm shocked that others ordered the same item and posted pictures that do look like the selling image...but mine did not come that way! And I ordered this specific jumpsuit because of the customer reviews and photos...which are complete phony.
2.0,It's OK  Beautiful on the website but not that pretty in person and too small for my husband's  Head
2.0,Took so long to receive then fit so small
2.0,hard to put on (if your kid has a lot of hair)
2.0,the string holding it together came apart after a few days. I ended up having to restring the bracelet myself. beads are really pretty though
2.0,Looks like fack not real.
2.0,Came with a scratch inside right near the middle where my nose is . I'm keeping them cuz I need them the scratch inst in my view.
2.0,We were purchasing these for our look alike costumes. They're way too small unless the toddlers are wearing them.
2.0,This headband needs to be wider. It doesn‚Äôt do much to keep sweat from dripping off my forehead when I workout.
2.0,Cute dress but way too small
2.0,"Compression not up to par.  The band at the top (like many compression socks) cuts more than it needs to.  Cannot make it thru a day without having to release the tourniquet caused by the extremely tight top band.......and have decided to go ahead and trash them.  They are also on the 'thin' side with respect to the feel at the foot (more play exists with normal shoes and you'll notice it).  Ultimately, the brand/product that I've found making the best 20-30mm compression socks today is SB-SOX.  Unfortunately, DVT's developed in the one leg during a surgery and I now have to wear this type of sock (with the 20-30mm rating) every day (not pleasant but the alternatives seemed worse).  After a dozen or so different brands/flavors (including the type your doctor gives you an Rx for - and that cost $60 (a waste of money for the Rx in my opinion)), I've only found two brands of the 20-30mm compression socks that are suitable for every day use that won't break the bank (SB-Sox as noted above and the other one was Run-4-Ever.........with discounts for multi-pairs, the SB's ended up being the product I go to the most).  Anyway, best of luck to others out there that have to wear them.  Thank you."
2.0,"primero Gracias al Vendedor por su comprension, el vestido es bonito, aunque dice que es cintura alta, en la foto no se mira mal, pero al ponerselo. No queda bien especialmente en las Damas de busto grande, deben de tomar en cuenta que en USA. hay todo tipo de nacionalidades, la mayoria que compramos por internet somos altas de estatura, y muchas de cuerpos voluminosos,<br />por lo tanto es mu humilde opinion es: lo adecuado seria que hagan la cintura normal, asi a todas que sabemos nuestras medidas quedamos contentas, por ejemplo yo compro en Amazon muchos vestidos y articulos de damas. Etc. para mi y a veces para regalar, mi sugerencia es que dise√±en segun al mercado donde puedan vender mas sus dise√±os, especial mente online, porque uno compra su size y salen chicos la mayoria de veces, es raro que queden como se ven online, por eso cuando encuentro el size bueno, siempre compro toda la colecion de colores que tienen. Amazon tiene todo mi record y saben que No miento, y no creo ser la primera en devolver por la cintura demasiada alta, porque en este caso, la cintura quedo exactamente en el busto, parece que la Dama esta embarazada, aunque no tenga abdomen grande se ve como si lo tuviese, repito el vestido es bonito, pero queda. Horrible en la Dama por la cintura que queda exactamente en el busto, si hicieran la cintura normal, creo que solo en California tendrian muchas Clientas, en nuestras Corporaciones. Todas son de busto grande. Gracias por la devolucion del dinero. ESTAMOS AGRADECIDA CON EL VENDEDOR, SU SERVICIO ES EFICIENTE. soy la Presidenta general de dos Corporaciones y con gusto les doy la informacion de Amazon, segun su trato y precios, porque a veces son mucho mas altos que en el mercado. Tambien a veces tienen buenas ofertas. GRACIAS."
2.0,"They don't make a difference in starburst for me. However, it may be different for so.eone else."
2.0,Masks were delivered fast. But it came in an open bag NOT happy .
2.0,My son was excited to get these but complained they were extremely tight on his feet. We checked the sizing and ordered the socks that aligned to his feet size and they were still too tight.
2.0,Title says it all.  Zipper broke the first day.
2.0,Too tight on bust
2.0,"Smelled like they were soaked in gasoline. I have washed my hands and they are in another room, but I can still smell them. More like thick tights material (spandex and polyester) than legging material (cotton and spandex). Attempting to return now."
2.0,"Surprisingly, this one fitted the smallest out of the colors I bought. Maroon and blue."
2.0,wat to small on upper arm
2.0,This was not a size 7. It was more 3T or 4T.
2.0,Great product but I'm 5ft 9in and it wasn't floor length like I expected it to be
2.0,Wasnt happy with the quality and not true to size!
2.0,"I am so disappointed in this poncho! I love the color; it's soft and warm, but so, so small. If you are a S/M, it might work. But it doesn't cover the arms, and it doesn't fit nicely at the waist. There is also way too much cowl at the top."
2.0,"Does not fit. I ordered the 2X, fit more like a ‚Äúcrop-top‚Äù not USA sizing. It‚Äôs cute but unfortunately does not fit me. (Fits especially tight in the chest area)"
2.0,My grandson was thrilled. Unfortunately it shrank so short after cold wash he can barely wear it
2.0,Not soft at all. Not comfortable. The fit is really off across the hips vs the waist.
2.0,Inexpensive and runs very small.  Ordered the same dress from another seller for a higher price and quality was much better.  This item is a cheaper knockoff.  Would not recommend.
2.0,There is a card inside that says the purse will transfer color and to take care that is not acceptable
2.0,"Two months in and the inner seam is coming undone, should at least last a summer!"
2.0,"Driving, snow removal"
2.0,Pros:<br />The sole on the boot is nice<br />Inner liner is warm and keeps my kid‚Äôs feet warm<br /><br />Cons:<br />Zipper falls down ALL THE TIME<br />Fur on the outside catches snow<br />Straps are way too long
2.0,"it was nice, just didn't like how it looked on me, I'm petite :("
2.0,"So these were really cute socks but I wasn't super thrilled with the material and they were smaller than I thought they would be and I have small feet. I got other brands in a size small that fit a lot better and stayed on throughout the day. These I couldn't get to stay on for longer than 10 minutes. Too bad, cause like I said they were cute & everyone's feet are obviously different so they may fit you perfectly."
2.0,These tear very easy .
2.0,"Frames were made of plastic and the ""polarized"" lenses were just stickers. Pass on these and keep looking for something else"
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:66f4db48b799bd31df5e2b1fd9496947]] This was or should have been a precious little dress but again, no quality control.  The seams on the front appeared to be sewn on the wrong side."
2.0,Usually wear a 2X but ordered a 3X because I wanted it loose.  Still tighter than I wanted.  Cute and doesn‚Äôt feel cheap though.  Recommend ordering two sizes larger than you usually wear unless you want a clingy fit.
2.0,"The design is very blurry, was giving me a headache so couldn't use it."
2.0,"I swear this is nothing more than Elmer's glue. Bought it for use on fishing rod handles. Does not go in smoothly and does not soak in to the surface at all, leaves a rough, somewhat brittle surface that is not very comfortable to the touch. Haven't had it on long enough to see how well it works  or last, but I have zero confidence in it."
2.0,"I wanted to like this hat, and did, right out of the box. It's an attractive and well-made hat, but it ends there.<br /><br />The sizing is squirrely; sure, the strap is long enough to fit a bigger head, up to sixe 7-3/4 even maybe, but only if you have an oddly narrow forehead that fits the hard, narrow curve of the stiff visor brim.<br /><br />That curve is a very tight radius and feels as if it would only fit a small, round head. For me, the strap went out far enough that it should have fit my head size, but with no way to change the built-in curvature of the back edge of the visor I could not force it onto my head and the extra length of strap was just a useless loop at the back.<br /><br />I've never had a baseball cap that fit like this before - or, more accurately, didn't fit. I'm not sure how to describe it - maybe it's meant for children and smaller women? If so, all the extra strap length in the world at the rear won't help because you cant change the very small radius of the front."
2.0,Flimsy material. Weak fragile zipper. These won't last a couple of weeks in my world. These shorts aren't worth half of what they cost. They actually aren't worth a dime when you realized you wasted your money and your time
2.0,Bought top and bottom of the same brand and they're not the same color (heather grey)
2.0,"I like the watch and the fact that it looks ""old skool"". I am a grown man and the band did not even touch the clasp on my wrist. WAY too small."
2.0,Glasses had warped lenses.
2.0,"Not a good slipper at all and they suck @ refunding it. Its not well made, something you should get more cheaper. Like the dollar tree."
2.0,This dress is amazing! It fits great. Unfortunately I received a dress that has a 3-4 rip in the sleeve so am having to return. Extremely bummed because I bought this to wear to a wedding this weekend!
2.0,The hat is ok... its too large for me and there's nothing to make it smaller.  I gave it to my boyfriend (now ex!) in order not to pay for shipping back.  Nice color but had 2 stains!
2.0,Loved the look but HATED the care instructions. &#34;Dry clean or hand wash cold&#34;... Um who has time for that for workout clothes?? Nope. Returning.
2.0,One corner was already frayed just after opening the package.  I am not sure I will keep it.  It seems to have held up OK when tied though.
2.0,Not happy. They don't work.
2.0,I have been searching for a raincoat in local stores without success other than the ponchos.<br />If it would not cost me shipping charges I would return this item.<br />I thought it would be fairly good material since it said machine wash.<br />If the entire raincoat was the same material as the belt I would be extremely satisfied.<br />Buttons are difficult to button and I fear will tear the thin &#34;material&#34; if used much.<br />I usually wear a size 8 and it does fit ok (got a medium) however it narrows at the hips.<br />Again if it were durable material and not this &#34;thin like plastic&#34; I wouldn't be too concerned.<br />The pattern is adorable and the length is great<br />Very disappointed in the material<br />Just have to look at it as disposableüòû
2.0,One of these plastic lenses was out upon arrival.  Since then they pop out upon occasion. Lenses are dark as pictured so be sure you in brite lite.  Also these dont stay on the hat well. Maybe it's the head.  These jus not for me
2.0,Way too big for my reading glasses.
2.0,I liked it but it was such a cheap material i am disappointed  i bought size 4/5 my son is 5 years old /super barato material encuanto se lo puse ami hijo se desilo de los botones ...
2.0,"It's very cute....but I can't get it around my neck, very disappointed."
2.0,They were cute but left my finger green after a few hrs
2.0,It was too big which makes it look more frumpy than cute. I found the material soft but somehow extremly hot
2.0,"Purchased for my three year old Granddaughter. Size 4-5 and I thought possibly a little big which was ok but when I see it.... way to small.<br />Colors were really cute but size, no."
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and this dress was almost too short on me. Worse though is see through :( had to return
2.0,Fit perfectly and easy to replace however when put the glasses on there is a blurry line going strait across the lenses and the tint is different on top than on the bottom. Very disappointed. Will not buy again.
2.0,I loved this dress it fit really well until I bent over it was extremely short on me! Would of loved it to be 5 inches longer!!
2.0,"I have had several Orient watches without any significant issues but the quality on this watch is lacking. Worn perhaps 30 or 40 times over 6 months. With no 31st in June, unscrewed crown and it separated from the stem. Now unable to change time, date. Have attempted to contact Orient Service Repair but very slow to respond. Web page says call but when you do it states start repair request on-line. Frustrating. Probably no more Orient watches for me."
2.0,"Not like the picture, very pastel -- I wanted the vivid colors.  Also, impossible to breathe with the filter in.  Without the filter, the mask sucks into your nose and you still can hardly breathe.  Disappointed."
2.0,"Returned it. It's a slim fit, not regular."
2.0,Sleeves were longer than previous Hugo Boss suits. I ended up sending it back.
2.0,I realize that each piece is unique in its own way. However larimer is ocean blue and this is green. It's heavy it's clunky it's not polished it's dull. If this had been shipped from the US I would be returning it.
2.0,Fit kinda funny.. Rides up your behind. I shouldn't have bought it and really don't recommend.
2.0,"Hands are very thin silver<br />Very difficult to read, especially in low light"
2.0,stretched out after first use
2.0,No shape to it. Nice fabric though!
2.0,"Cheap jacket looking Jacket for the price, material was not so great. Should lower the price"
2.0,It looked like the picture.  But I thought it looked three dimensionsland it is flat
2.0,These wore out and got pills and holes in them quickly. Wouldn't recommend for regular use.
2.0,Cute shoes but not a cute fit I wore them out to the store and so glad a keep back up shoes in my car...
2.0,not a good description of shirt
2.0,"This tail was just what I wanted for an 8 year old's cat Halloween costume.  It fits great, stays put, and you can bend the tail however you would like.  Would have given it 5 stars except it looks like the one i received may have had the tip cut off, and now white fluff is hanging out.  It will be easier to fix than to return, just annoying as I paid for brand new.  2 stars."
2.0,Too small in the chest.
2.0,broke the very first wear and didn't come out as the picture it was all tangled
2.0,Sent it back. The colors were not like this.. they were very pale and dull.
2.0,"Initially I thought this bag was beautiful, but the quality wasn't great.  Although the leather was nice, the straps were not good.  They broke after only putting a few pounds of stuff in there.  It's a backpack.  It should be able to carry things.  Mind you, what I put in there wasn't heavy at all!  It was hopeless to use this as a cute bag for school though.  I wasn't even planning on using textbooks with this, but now I don't think I can feel secure carrying anything over 3 or 4 lbs without worrying about the straps coming out.  FYI, the straps are buttoned on, so when I say that they broke, I meant that they unhook, which is really annoying to stop and fix all the time.  I'm not a fan, so I sent this back."
2.0,It is soo big and the shirt didn't have the cute little flower
2.0,This runs very small. A 2X is almost like a men's Large! The high visibility lines feel cheap and like they will peel or crack off. I'm sending this back.
2.0,Pros: Really cheap<br />Serve their purpose<br /><br />Cons:  they're incredibly small
2.0,"The top isn‚Äôt like the picture and the bottom doesn‚Äôt fold like the picture either. Wouldn‚Äôt have gotten it if I‚Äôd have known. Its not elegant, but eh‚Ä¶"
2.0,"Smaller than depicted and not as vibrant in color. Nonetheless cute so I kept them. However the second day putting them on they slipped out of my hand and fell onto my dresser top, a very very short fall, and several beads broke off. I know I couldn't expect much at such a low price, but it was a disappointment none the less."
2.0,Great suit EXCEPT the shorts attached to suit have very LOOSE elasticity.  This causes the shorts to ride up your buttock and give you literally a WEDGIE!!!!  Also it is not long enough in back to cover your buttock so this shows wedgie !!!<br />The size was accurately ordered / it‚Äôs the poor make of the short under the suit !!
2.0,"The product looks amazing and shipping happened very quickly.  Unfortunately, the second time it was worn, once for a trunk or treat and one day for an event it lost it tassels and many of the trim pieces began to peel away from the foam they were backed with.  I am frustrated that the item cost $100 and didn‚Äôt even hold up through being worn twice."
2.0,"It was nice and thick, very comfortable, but was heavy to carry and popped on my 3rd trip."
2.0,"The length is good and it doesn't ride up the leg - BUT the padding is no good for us ladies. Most of the padding is in the buttocks area, which actually leverages your crotch further into the bike seat, causing crushing in all the wrong places! I felt like I had been wrongly violated after wearing these...lol. Later, I found a great set of bike shorts at TJ Maxx for $12.99 that had such phenomenal padding designed for women I'm shocked this is even advertised as being for women."
2.0,These are poor quality. I ordered another pack of 5 of another brand which was cheaper than this one pair and they were better quality. Fabric has already started coming apart and they also don‚Äôt stay up well
2.0,Beautiful and good design but super hard to put on and falls off very easily. I was wearing it yesterday and never noticed it fell off - waste of money now that it‚Äôs lost forever.
2.0,Very very cheap material
2.0,"too small, pretty disappointed"
2.0,I have locks and it's long and a lot of hair and have effortlessly been seeking a hat that can accommodate me when I put my hair up! Even when it's down the hat still rolls up.
2.0,"This ring, which is advertised as stainless steel and engraved, broke in half!! Ring was for my daughter and she loves it. Very upsetting."
2.0,"Pretty top but much too long! I wanted to wear it with work dress pants but I would have to tuck it in, and even then it didn't look right . More see-through than expected, will have to wear something underneath. I'll be returning due to length."
2.0,"The top is lined weird. So when I put on the bikini it doesn't line up properly, so instead of just the pink lace and navy suit you can see part of the white inside. I tried fixing it but it goes back to showing the second I let it go.<br /><br />The bottoms aren't Brazilian so they're revealing which I'm ok with. The ride lower then I would hope but main thing is because it's cheeky when I walk I feel like my butt cheeks are eating them. Maybe if you have a smaller butt or less fat on your butt. If you got some meat on your butt these bottoms might be annoying."
2.0,"Sorry, I  found the product too light weight.  I wish the product description had indicated that there was no backing material on the bibs."
2.0,"I really wanted to like this case when I received it. It actually looked really good in the package but as soon as I opened it, the smell was quickly evident.<br /><br />Many people commented on the smell so I was ready for it but I figured I could just let it air out for a couple of days outside (didn't help), then I ""Febrezed"" it and let it sit for another day (didn't help), then I let it sit outside for about 8-9 days figuring nature would do it's thing, (She didn't).<br /><br />The smell remained and it's just unbearable.<br /><br />The smell is probably from the manufacturing process where they probably use the same machines for many other things and it's defineitly a smell you DO NOT want to get on your clothes.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Looks nice<br />- zipper works well<br />- fits adult sunglasses easily (see images)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Smells like a gas station<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />Someone said if you wait 6 weeks the smell would go away...hmmmm...life's too short for that nonsense...Returned.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE PURCHASE:<br />I ended buying this case instead and it was overall better and ZERO smell...<br /><br />Action Sports Protective Semi Hard Sunglasses<br />http://amzn.to/1dBXxXM<br /><br />_______________________________________<br />Hope this helps another Amazon Shopper,<br /><br />Cheers  ;)"
2.0,Less than 24 hours and the underwear is falling apart at the seams. It is really a shame because I've been looking for quality girdle/panties for a while. It would have been great if the thread and stitching were professional quality.
2.0,I am barely a 32 A and this top was even too small for me. The pattern is cute. The material is ok for the price but I don‚Äôt think it would last long. The bottoms are too cheeky for me but  not terribly so. Had to return due to the weirdly small top.
2.0,"Locket cute, chain is very cheap. I will need to replace it."
2.0,"The size of this necklace is RIDICULOUSLY large.  The cat head is like 2"" wide.  It's HUGE.  We paid way too much for this, given it's appearance in person.  Sorry, can't recommend.  My 9 year old doesn't care for it.  Hope that helps.  You may like; just expect it to be large."
2.0,Way too big for an average woman's face
2.0,"in the image shown the  Cloak appears a rich deep burgundy color, and it was not it was a Santa clause bright red, did not sit well material  too flimsy ."
2.0,This is a full size too big. When the skirt is voluminous it makes you look bigger. The lines were lined up nicely. The fabric is rough and cheap. But the number one reason this is going back today is that it isn't red and white gingham. It is red and grayish. Not in a good way. It looks like you tossed in some black clothes when you washed it and the color bled. I've never seen a gingham pattern with a grayish contrast color. I typically wear large in this brand but this fit like an xl or maybe even xxl.
2.0,"To be perfectly honest I was super happy with the strap when it came in and it was extremely easy to switch out with the original strap on my watch, my only complaint is that I've had it on for about a week (everyday use) and its already started to tear. If you plan on putting this on to a watch you dont wear often or have multiple straps that you switch out with for whatever outfit you wear you should be happy with this product. It was wasnt made strong enough for the amount of use I put it through I suppose."
2.0,To thick for a summer dress not a col material
2.0,Little loose and see through
2.0,Was not a bright teal like picture. More like a dark green teal.
2.0,I wore it one day and as I was working everything was all good until I took it off to find out my shirt and pants were soaked I was warm tho
2.0,Tall ladies beware. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 135 lbs. I generally wear a US 6. I followed instructions and ordered the US 8. The skirt fit beautifully. The shirt just gets wider but no longer. The sleeves are too short but also very big and loose. The bottom of the shirt is super short on me. Doesn‚Äôt even hit the top of my underwear. I think a typical petite height could do well with this. Tall women will be disappointed.
2.0,Very baggy and thin material. No good!
2.0,The color was not purple at all and it is bigger than it looked I was hoping for a smaller ring. But it is light weight and the clasp is super easy to open and close but that's it and u can't really even see the opal.
2.0,I loved how they looked..... In the box! I don't buy wide with shoes.... Well I would have to get extra wide if I was gonna buy these. Super narrow! I give it a two star cuz they are cute but way to narrow
2.0,I was so looking forward to getting this outfit but I was disappointed. I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù 125 lbs. 34 D. I ordered a medium. The length was short in the inseam so when I sat down the neckline would dig into my neck but the top was gapping open at the arm holes. The leg length was too short to be ankle length and too long to look like the stock picture. The stripes where the leg seams meet at your lower stomach are off and the belt tie does cover it as long as you are standing still. The fabric was not soft but i could have dealt with it if it fit right. I have requested to return the outfit and I am now waiting for a reply. I really wanted this outfit to work.
2.0,"It's totally my bad, I made the order too quickly.  But I just HATE people how create the false advertising (picturing two items when it is just one).  It's just bad policy to try to get a few extra suckers out there (like me) - Hopefully not you too‚Ä¶  BEWARE"
2.0,ordered an XL and I usually wear a medium.  Ended up giving it to my 7 year old.
2.0,"The leather in the band was already splitting when I took it out of the box. Never even wore it. It's nice-looking, but the quality of the manufacturing is obviously lousy."
2.0,"Got these in Febuaray 2017 they were great when i first got the, now its May 4th and my insides of my slippers are falat n my feet are walking on the soles, the memory foam is shot. will not buy again"
2.0,My daughter couldn‚Äôt wait to wear this set to school. Such a pretty set. But 1st time wearing it and the thinner one broke. Looks like the Jump ring fell off. Thankfully she saw it fall off - but couldn‚Äôt find the jump ring so it‚Äôs worthless now. üò©
2.0,"I'm not really sure how this bathing suit is supposed to go on.... I have tried many ways and I just can't get it to look like the photo. My sister was able to sew the strap to get it to look a little better, but I can't."
2.0,Cheaply made. Has threads hanging off and seams pucker
2.0,This dress was very large and boxy. Looked nothing like the photos on. The material was stiff and scratchy. The arms were much smaller than the rest of the dress making it very tight at the top and almost too big throughout the rest of the dress. I was very disappointed because it had so many promising reviews.
2.0,"The hat is not as big as it looks on the model and the color is not white, but a yellowish cream. Very disappointing"
2.0,Too small for big legs. I got cramps during the night after wearing the socks all day. I'm going to throw them away.
2.0,forget it !plastic bezel !!not shiny  I wish I can find a nice one quality like this one !!!stay away !
2.0,Sleeves were too short and torso in back was short. Sent back.
2.0,Its not of good quality and shape is not good and design is bad
2.0,Color in the picture is much lighter than what I received... It looks dark grey.. This was a birthday gift and now stuck without a gift.
2.0,"Advertised as carbon fiber, it's not. The entire thing is metal. Heavy cold metal. POS"
2.0,"The colors and style were great but I didn't care for the material so I ended up returning it. It was more of a stretchy, shiny type material that just wasn't what I expected."
2.0,i was so excited for this shirt ive been looking all over for a white shirt for the gym thats not see through but it didn‚Äôt suffice
2.0,This was not really a tunic as the length was short a little longer than a regular t-shirt. The fit seemed about right. I was glad I didn't go smaller as others suggested.
2.0,Made it half a mile before these thing disappeared and gave me a wedgie
2.0,"My son has worn UA shoes for years and we've been very pleased with the quality and wear.  We've never had a problem.  When these came out of the box he was delighted with the look and comfort.  Another winner.  But 2.5 weeks after putting them on, the front part of the sole, the part that wraps up around the front of the shoe, has started peeling off.  It's about half an inch off at this point.  Can't believe it.  We have NEVER had problems with UA shoes before.  Very sad, as these weren't cheap."
2.0,Pero no son de buena calidad
2.0,"This looks okay at a distance.  Up close you can tell how cheap it is.  The opal stone is so thin that even with the prongs tightened the stone moves around constantly.  Not sure what about it irritated my finger, but something did so I cannot wear it."
2.0,"I should have learned my lesson by now that items on Amazon are not as they appear. And this top is no exception. I ordered the ‚Äúdark grey‚Äù and it is more of a light/silver grey which is not my taste. The material is soft and stretchy, but I didn‚Äôt find it very flattering. Will be returning"
2.0,Loved my ear vines but they broke after wearing just twice !
2.0,"This Scarf and Necklace are pretty, but from the listing Stone means Gemstones and these were Plastic, not real looking at all.  Really disappointed.  I never would have bought if I had known they were plastic.  The style is awesome, but the fake stones ruin the look."
2.0,"I really love infinity scarves. I have a few for the winter time, but I don‚Äôt have any lightweight infinity scarves so I was pretty hyped to purchase this product. Considering the overwhelming positive reviews, I felt like I had nothing to lose and that the purchase would be worth the while. When the product came in, I practically jumped for joy. The product came in a plastic bag. I purchased it in the color SF101893F, which I found to be stunningly beautiful. It had a floral design and it‚Äôs perfect to wear outside because it‚Äôs lightweight and attractive in appearance.<br /><br />The scarf is extremely comfortable. It‚Äôs not suffocating and it‚Äôs really soft. It doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin, which is great since my skin gets easily irritated and itchy. I would say that the fabric is breathable and anti-wrinkle. I crumpled the scarf to test out the wrinkles part and it stayed intact, which I found to be great because that means it won't look like it's all over the place.<br /><br />This scarf is the perfect accessory to pair with pretty much anything. It‚Äôs great as a cover-up dress when you go to the beach. It‚Äôs perfect to wear with a solid colored dress or top. In addition, the scarf can be worn in many ways. You can switch up easily depending on the look you want or your preferences. The scarf can be worn as a shawl, like a hood, simply as a scarf, and more.<br /><br />However, although, I really love the scarf. I question the quality and its sustainability. I think the scarf is not going to last very long. I think after a few washes and wears, it‚Äôs going to essentially deteriorate. After I purchased the product, of course, I inspected the product thoroughly. There are stray strings in a few places on the side and the middle. Afterward, I inspected the middle of the scarf inside and out. The inside of the stitching appears to be fine. On the outside, however, there‚Äôs a part in which the stitching is starting to loosen and there are a few holes. Therefore, I have reason to question how durable that the fabric of the product is as the product is extremely fragile and the stitching is not well done.<br /><br />All in all, I‚Äôm not really sure if I can recommend this product or not. Based on the reviews, everyone else had a pretty positive experience with the exception of a few reviews. I‚Äôm not sure if I received a defective product or the construction and quality are just generally that bad but based on my experience, I can‚Äôt recommend it. However, there is potentiality that my experience and a few others are just rare occurrences. To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it.<br /><br />I gave the product 2 stars because although the construction and quality of the product are bad, it‚Äôs still attractive. It just won't last long though and so, I don't find it to be worth the purchase. Maybe if the quality was better and the fabric wasn't skimped on I would recommend it. I have had better scarves in general.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Cute<br />-Has multi-purposes<br />-Does not irritate skin<br />-Anti-wrinkle<br />-Lightweight<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Bad stitching<br />-Does not seem like it‚Äôs going to last long<br />-Stray strings<br /><br />Disclosure: I have received this product in exchange for my honest review. However, my review is 100% my own unbiased opinion."
2.0,Runs small and not the best material.
2.0,The leather is very stiff and scratchy.  I will never wear it unless I take it apart and replace the leather with something softer.
2.0,Cute tote but I paid the upgrade for a zipper and the bag that was delivered doesn't have ANY zippers.
2.0,Great colors and style.<br />Fit was way too big in the back and really really small in the cup. Sad I had to return
2.0,"They might be ok for home kitchen use. But, they're not ok for using to protect your son's hands and arms if he's the dishwasher at the local BBQ restaurant. One pair lasts two 8hr shifts. Buyer beware, not for professional use at all."
2.0,"Very pretty but the piercing is too thick, can't use these ever because it hurts way to much to try and put them on. Waisted money."
2.0,I have this shirt in a large but grew out of it. I ordered XL this time. They are wider but the same length. On a skinny guy like me it is an awkward fit. A large tall size would have been better.
2.0,Listen..read this before buying. I didn't read the reviews. Hence the greater disappointment I felt. I bought this item for a maternity shoot. Ill add a photo later. Like every comment above its made of zip ties! ZIP TIES LADIES! OMG. MY HEART. Thr headband is light as well as the zip ties.. but don't make any doubt about it others can clearly see its zip ties too.. Now in a photo...well let's just say you can get away with the illusion.. but i had to call my husband because I couldn't processed that I bought almost 20.00 worth of zip ties. It's your choice ladies. I wouldn't spend my money on this again.
2.0,"This costume is a conundrum. The stockings that came with it are baggy. The dress is very form fitted and short. I had to wear pants underneath it because the dress didn‚Äôt cover my rear. The material itself is soft but it has zero give because it is 100% felt fabric. The Velcro belt was also extremely tight. With all of that said, it is still adorable in person, so if you are wanting to order it, size up 1 or 2 sizes to get a proper fit."
2.0,Buttons on wrong side.
2.0,"I bought these to wear with my loafers. They felt fine at first, but a few hours later they had rolled under my heel, and were bothersome. They just didn't stay in place. Will not buy these again"
2.0,"Firstoff, I don't see how a product like this could be ""one size."" Secondly, the right sleeve developed a small hole during my first use, which by the third use became a huge, elongated ""run."" I still use it and place the run on the inside of my right arm, but I have one particular tennis student who continually points it out... I could say that it is comfortable and lightweight, but think of it merely as a disposable sun protectant only. There is no considerable compression benefit."
2.0,Fits great but the Bebe comes off on first wash. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
2.0,The sweat suit is a good quality its just that its way too small.  Heavy weight sweat suit!  Good for the winter. Must order at least one or two sizes larger when ordering!
2.0,Was not comfortable
2.0,Sides are getting stuck on cloths snagging cloths. On a brighter note the magnetic strip is super strong.
2.0,"This literally fell apart on my wrist after only a few months of normal wear, The portion that connected the band to the watch just came apart and the watch fell off my wrist. I would not recommend this band for that reason"
2.0,"I wear a lot bandannas in the summer working outside or riding my bike, it helps keep the sweat from getting in my eyes, that's why I bought it. I also bought it. I gave it 2 stars because it looks cool if it's folded over, but it's very thin and I can even see through it. I plan to keep it as it didn't cost that much, but I'm disappointed in regards to the thin material and low quality. A lot of my other bandannas are thicker and much better quality. Just FYI for everyone."
2.0,Waist fits but the length doesn't even cover my butt! I bought a M and normally wear a M.
2.0,"It is pretty and it fits.  But I don't like the feel of the fabric.  Otherwise, it's a pretty top."
2.0,I purchased 2 sizes larger than I typically wear and it is still smaller than expected. It fits a lot shorter than the picture.  Still wearable but nothing like the photo shows.
2.0,Runs small could not get on feet would be great if was true to size
2.0,Color is very light blur and I need to wear something under it because it is see through.
2.0,"Supercute lightweight top, however, the red ran all over when I washed it, so I won't be able to wear it."
2.0,So see-through! Much longer than expected
2.0,It is nothing like pictured. It is skin tight and a belly shirt if you dry it. It is a weird stretchy material.
2.0,"Warmpth - 5/5 - I haven't had any super cold weather since I got them but at or just below freezing my hands stay nice and warm.<br /><br />Touch screen - 3/5 - Tapping and short swipes work well, but trying to enter a pattern password is impossible.  Plus, as I'll mention next, the extra length on the end of the pointer and thumb make it feel very clunky and unnatural.<br /><br />Fit - 2/5 - I got a medium size and it's about the same as my last pair of winter gloves that were medium.  However, the wrist part tends to fold inside the gloves when you put them on and digging then out is time consuming and annoying.  The worst part about these gloves though, is the extra half inch that sticks out from the pointer finger and thumb.  I assume it has something to do with making those fingers touch screen sensitive, can because it's only on those fingers in each hand.  It makes interacting with a touch screen a careful operation, and something as simple as finding a key on a keychain and unlocking a door infuriating.  Just wrap some tape around the ends of your fingers so it sticks out a half inch from the top and try to do anything.  You'll know what I mean.<br /><br />I've had these for less than a week and I'm already looking at other gloves, I'm just glad they were fairly cheap."
2.0,"Smaller<br /><br />Smaller than it look,very short."
2.0,This has two colors in it and the one color looks fake
2.0,good colors.  but there not as long as pictured.  they are getting thinner with every wash. hopefully they last a while.
2.0,"If your a heavy women like me don't buy. It's a nice product for thin women just to tight for a thicker women. I'm 42&#34; beast & 36&#34; waist it doesn't fit like shown in the picture, I feel like if I move to much it might break."
2.0,No le gustaron las mangas estaban demasiado anchas y el<br />Color no era igual que la picture era mucho m√°s claro y una trla mur corriente
2.0,Disappointed about this order because two pairs came with holes already in them around the ankles. The socks also do not fit consistently. 1pair fits differently the another. The QC for these is very poor.
2.0,"Disappointed as it is too short for my liking, it does not appear to cover the butt as mentioned or looks in the pictures.  :/"
2.0,Cheaply made and didn't seem as advertised. For one the label name was Toms Ware. The package looked like it was opened before. And the cuffs were certainly not reversible.
2.0,They are very pretty and look like faux Tiffany but I found them a bit heavy and dragging my holes down
2.0,"Nice fit, but seams came apart on one of the three on first west."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt get my dress I ordered.got pants instead
2.0,Very heavy material. Looks more maternity. Just an odd hang
2.0,Does not keep good time
2.0,My 21 yr old daughter has tiny hands and the ring came apart within an hr of having it on!
2.0,"It was advertised for as a ski hat, it's very thin cotton, wouldn't keep me warm. Ok if your just wearing it too look cool, or don't need much warmth."
2.0,I wish they wouldn't put the permanent padding in the top; but the bottom fit great (I am 125# and ordered an XL). Had to return it because the top made me look like a carpenter's dream (flat as a board)
2.0,"made my fingers look big, thick...<br />wanted them for my minnie mouse costume but i'll be wearing no gloves and painting my nails instead."
2.0,I am going to keep the shirts only because I needed black long sleeves for work this week but I‚Äôm glad I went with a Medium to feel some type of tightness- everyone says they run small but for me If I‚Äôm looking for compression shirts I‚Äôm looking for something to fit me tight and this was not it for me. Fits more like a regular t shirt. Not thick enough -no scrunches anywhere so not sure what its suppose to hold? Maybe the lines on the arm area (which is a joke). Someone mentioned the name needs to be changed and I agree- everyone that bought it for under their SCRUBS seem to love it so that could be a better fit.
2.0,One of the House dresses was made wrong. It is super tight and short(Above the knee) the other two were okay.
2.0,"Great photos, but in real time, it's made very cheaply.  Straps were uneven.  There are much better totes out there."
2.0,Use the large suitcase twice  and the zipper is broken and the stitching where the two halves hinge is coming apart. Had to use cord to hold together till we get home. The other two cases where used 4 times and are holding up.  The large case was never overfilled or over weight.  Both trips the suitcase never had more then 42 lbs . So be cautious
2.0,"True to size. Fabric feels cheap, and the images are cheap iron ons. Colors are bright and attractive. Will keep only because kiddo loves outer space, but they're not worth $17. Spend your money elsewhere."
2.0,I was expecting the top to fit closely to the skull but it's floppy. Disappointing.
2.0,If you are full-size on top this will most likely not fit you. Also it was listed as Prime and shipping time was misleading as about 7-10 days but took over 33 days to arrive. Does not look as nice in picture and length is good if you're petite. Do not recommend. Ordered XXL but wear L normally.
2.0,The lining is coming out!  The bag is very nice on the outside but inside is terrible.  I would not recommend this bag.
2.0,"these are loose fitting underwear bike shorts.  The pad is OK, but they would greatly benefit from a couple more inches of inseam, the 3/4 inch length on mine rub against my inner thigh.  There are no leg grips.  the tag is placed in front, rather strange.  have used only twice, cannot comment on durability.  I will try using them for longer motorcycle rides to see if the padding will improve my butt to seat tolerance."
2.0,Very firm and just not comfortable in my opinion.
2.0,I don't know why but they keep sliding down
2.0,"We ordered this mask for Halloween for my son,  it broke  as we unpacked it. It was nice quality just very disappointed it was so brittle."
2.0,Great glasses just the progression of the tint makes them somewhat dizzying to wear
2.0,The dress is beautiful and the quality is very good. The sizing was incorrect. It was listed as XL and it looked like a size 10. Five stars for the dress 1 star for sizing.
2.0,The neckpiece is made with terrible parts ! The beads on the chain on either side of the pendant don‚Äôt even match !! The round disc looks like a cheaply fixed after thought !!<br />Buying from Sansar  is turning out to be disappointing  more often that not !!!
2.0,falling apart. strings are separating from it. Not very happy about it.
2.0,"I returned this item, did not look anything like the picture and it was too small."
2.0,"I loved it at first, but after one wash it shrunk one size and then didn't fit any more."
2.0,Watch didn't last very long after it got wet. Good value good looking watch.
2.0,We received this product with 10 out of 40 lights that were burned out.  The lights were not good quality compared to others my children have had. The rubber bands to attach them to your fingers fall out and are tricky to reinsert. The price was still good for what you do get.
2.0,"I got a 4x thinking it would be too large, but it is more like a 2x. If you have thick thighs I would not choose this product."
2.0,"A lot smaller than what I expected , dose not make a noise, I bought a bell so it should ring , smaller than a bell on a cat coller"
2.0,"Mightve been just me, but i could never get them in."
2.0,Compared to an etsy purchase thiese were very thing metal  Usable but disappointed in quality
2.0,Pretty but a couple of the backs were bent and I had an allergic reaction to them very quickly which generally doesn't happen with stainless steel...
2.0,These are nice material but certainly not oversize/relaxed fit.
2.0,"These look okay, but do not last at all. They are made from cheap cloth and have developed holes very soon after arriving."
2.0,"I'm 5'10"" and about 175lbs, and the Large was too small.  The material is comfortable, but will only be wearing these around the house.  The Large fits like a Medium."
2.0,The size was not correctly labeled. They were way smaller than 9/16
2.0,"When I first received this dress, I loved it! It fit perfectly, and the pockets were a nice addition. However, after one wash (on cold) the skirt shrunk awkwardly - the pockets now stick out and the skirt is very bunchy around them, not flattering at all. No amount of ironing has been able to make them lie flat. It's really disappointing because I wanted so badly to like it."
2.0,The belt was a perfect fit. the suit was alittle on the small side but good. however the mask tore as soon as I put it on.
2.0,I wear it to sleep. Was too large and not flattering. If it was 2x smaller it would‚Äôve been cute. Like as my pjs nlw
2.0,"Left marks on top of foot, not like walking on cloud, kinda stiff."
2.0,"oadPerhaps it's the kind of temples I had on my old glasses - these slipped right off several times such that I wasn't able to use them. I recall when I was MUCH younger, playing sports and such, I had a strap that looked like these; however the rubber connection piece on those was broader and more adherent and stuck like glue. Sigh."
2.0,Nice product. Leather comes off and all over clothes. Doesn‚Äôt have the leather smell. Not sure if it‚Äôs genuine leather.overpriced product. wouldn‚Äôt recommend. You can find cheaper products for more value. 2 stars for style and look.
2.0,"This is a strangely cut zip up! It doesn't fit like a typical hoodie -the sleeves are plenty long and roomy, but the hood is small and it's too fitted on the waist and hips for a zip up, you can't really wear anything under it that's looser fitting. I took another reviewer's advice and ordered a size larger, as she warned it runs small. I'm a medium in most other brands, so ordered a large and the hood was short, sleeves very roomy and too long, however the waist and hips were too snug, and I'm not that curvy!"
2.0,"The dress I received was NOT THE SAME AS PICTURED.  Colors are more multicolored then basically BLUE as pictured, and VERY LITTLE BLUE.  ALSO, the SLEEVES ARE BARELY THERE. Closer to SLEEVELESS.  ALSO, the fabric is extremely thin, and some sort of ""blend."" Not even close to the picture."
2.0,"I washed this jacket on gentle cycle, no soap and in cold water and when I took it out of the washer the material ripped at the seam on the inside of the jacket right by the zipper. Beautiful color, love the color of the zippers and how there easy to open and close but it's made out of polyester material and will tear easily."
2.0,"These joggers looked good, and seemed fairly well made, but despite ordering 3 sizes larger than my son normally wears, they were still too small."
2.0,"The stopwatch only goes up to an hour, and then it starts over again. I did not realize this when purchasing. If you are going to use it for anything over 59 minutes (hiking, trail running, marathons, etc.) this is not the best choice. I really wanted to love it, and otherwise it works great."
2.0,Terrible material.... runs big
2.0,"The dress fits perfectly , the style is wonderful however I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric."
2.0,Only have it 2 stars because the price made it good. But the material used looked plasticy. The string ends are unfinished. And it's bigger than you think. Wouldn't buy it again.
2.0,The clasp keeps popping open. Other than that it‚Äôs ok.
2.0,Does not fit well. Buy bigger.
2.0,There's no flare. How do they stay in?
2.0,Didnt like the zipper
2.0,Smaller than expected. Fits perfect on my 12 year-old. But to snap for an average adult
2.0,Low quality. I gave it to my kid because it looks like something a child would wear. Thicker width but thinner metal than in photos.
2.0,"What do I expect for the price, off course cheap material. It looks good on the model though."
2.0,Too heavy and not soft at all... very uncomfortable when putting it on...
2.0,"Bummer. While the picture of the red is a beautiful and deep red, what I received is definitely not. I would call it burgundy - maybe even wine, maroon. I would never look at it and call it &#34;red.&#34; I'm disappointed because I have nothing these will match with. :( I'll probably given them away.  Also - FYI: the pattern doesn't go completely all the way around."
2.0,would be fine for a child or a child's party but not the quality we were looking for.
2.0,I wanted to love these but they cut the inside of my daughter‚Äôs foot up on both feet!! I felt horrible when I took them off of her. She had them on only an hour.
2.0,Cute but didn‚Äôt fit my feet well. Was sad to return them.
2.0,Order a size up if you can. Also its not all the way to the floor like the picture shows. It's tea length. I could tell right from opening the package that it was going to be too small. Super bummer.
2.0,They broke within a month and the black came off easily
2.0,Very light fabric and not for protection for the mask.
2.0,Item was returned the material was very thin
2.0,"bent on 2nd time using, flimsy waste of money"
2.0,their staff is okay but the return is NOT FREE as it says. BE CAREFUL!!!
2.0,You get what you pay for. I like the looks but wish it had not fallen apart so quickly.
2.0,Way too small. Not loose fitting like the picture.
2.0,"The watch is nice looking and works but within the day it was given as a gift the lug(piece that keeps strap connected to the face) fell out.  We found it once but not the second time so now I have to take the time to take it to a repair shop to get it fixed.  So, the quality doesn't seem the greatest."
2.0,Really cheap quality. It's super thin and breaks really easily into tiny strands. Will return this item and try another slightly more expensive bouffant cap from amazon to see if the quality is better.
2.0,One of the two set of stats works great and claps the shirt very well. The other side doesn't stay on at all. I attach the stay to the bottom of the shirt and as soon as I put the stirrup around my foot the shirt stay pops right off. The only way I can get the stay to work properly is to fold the shirt over and force extra into the clasp to get it to stay. The molded plastic is not sufficient to hold my shirt in place. I will be looking for a new set of stays immediately.
2.0,"the fit was horrible, way to small"
2.0,"the other reviews are right, looks nothing like the pic. bought for my mom at her request. was going to return it but she thought it was funny and kept it."
2.0,Shoe laces came in completely wrong...too large and too wide.
2.0,The good is beautiful but I was sent the last one and it was defective. It had been repaired. And the attachments were not staying in place. I returned it right away.
2.0,Loved this however the owl fell off within a week.
2.0,"I really liked the design of this band and slip on functionality however, it did not fit snug and slid up and down my arm. I did not see an option to select a size at checkout."
2.0,I have size 6.5 feet and I cannot fit my running shoes into the 'shoe/laundry bag'. Very disappointed at the misleading product description.
2.0,cheap.  these thinks are so cheap there is almost no fabric to absorb sweat.  I wish I Just would have bought a couple nice ones.
2.0,too big dont like it
2.0,"Ok, I love the way these pants feel! They're super comfy, and fit as advertised. I only have two complaints, but they're pretty major! One is that this &#34;boyfriend style&#34; is just regular,bootcut pajama jeans rolled up! I know this because I bought this and the regular pair, and these unrolled in the wash. They're identical... Second, THEY SMELL AWFUL!!! I've washed them 3 times, and the bitter smell still lingers. The first day I wore them I kept looking at my feet checking for dog crap before finally realizing it was my pants! I'm keeping them for the comfort, because they really are very comfortable. Hopefully with a few more washes they won't stink!"
2.0,Entirely too big. Not true to size at all. A large is more like a 2-3x . Seems like good quality fabric but they‚Äôre huge .
2.0,It‚Äôs gorgeous but I should‚Äôve read the reviews. They won‚Äôt fit at all. Don‚Äôt buy unless you have pin needle nipples.
2.0,"As I thought buying clothes through Amazon is a waste of time. I wasted half an hour to try to make sure I was getting cotton shorts of a good length that I could use while exercising outside. These are zero % cotton, so large they will fall off, and the pockets would keep absolutely nothing in it while I‚Äôm moving. Pictures are deceptive and I somehow got 0% cotton shorts when searching ‚Äúcotton exercise shorts‚Äù. Now I have to give up on my money or waste time returning them. (It would cost more to take an Uber to the return center than I would get returning them.) It‚Äôs a scam."
2.0,Decent quality but way too small.
2.0,Not as advertised. Not true to size make sure you order up two sizes. Especially if you are busty.
2.0,It was a gift for my daughter. I saw it in person and think it was cloudy. Not as pretty as I thought it would be.
2.0,I ordered a xxl & it was small I wish it was bigger
2.0,"The frame has sharp edges, look to big on my face"
2.0,"This is basically a cover up, not a dress. It's a piecs of cheap fabric made to look like a quality dress. Yhis is definitely not worth buying,  unless you want a decent looking swim suit cover uo or resort lounge wear. If  you're top heavy, go up one size. It fits true to size except in the bust area. It's actually very uncomfortable to lounge or sleep in."
2.0,"Just something weird about the fit.  It just hangs per say and leaves a gap under arm, so bra shows.  It's not a ""sexy"" shirt; go 1 size down if buying."
2.0,the pants fit well however i did not receive the color i choose.
2.0,Super cute. Bought for my Christmas party. Zipper broke when zipping up. Didn‚Äôt get to wear it
2.0,"Extremely disappointed!  The quality and coloring look so much better than in real life!  The blue looks regally bluer and the gold more metallic in picture.  Oh well, I will wear it.  Oh, also it is twisted in a wrong way."
2.0,"Had to return it and never reordered. First the order came in late and when they arrived they were way to small. I ordered 2 and sent them right back. Also in the pictures you hardly see it, but there is a thread that is used in the button area to highlight and it dosent look that great."
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and the dress is wayyyy too long - even with 4‚Äù heels it drags on the floor.<br />Not the softest fabric.
2.0,"All four aprons are the same size. Light colored, thin, cotton apron. I don't think I'll be able to keep it looking neat after the initial few splashes and splatters. I also don't fancy having to iron something like an apron. Not a low maintenance daily use product, in my opinion."
2.0,"Looked like I had on a tube......did not flatter at all. To look right, you must need to be 6'7 and 100 lbs."
2.0,The sandals are a good quality and very pretty but I had to return mine. They do not stretch and were way too tight on the top of my foot.
2.0,I liked the way it fit but the green top does not match the bottoms at all. The greens in the bottoms are completely different.
2.0,"The fit was on the small side for me.  I normally wear a 10.5, so ordered an 11.  They were too small.  I exchanged them for a 12 which fit well.  They are comfortable, but they have a bad smell.  I intend to use them only outside so I can leave them on the porch.  Otherwise I would return them.  The bad smell effected an entire room inside."
2.0,"I feel like it's false advertising, but it does mention in small text that it is ""solid"", its up to you to interpret that means it's only one color.<br /><br />I used a permanent marker to draw eyes, nose and mouth"
2.0,Have this for less than a week its already falling apart
2.0,I don‚Äôt know what it is saying in Arabic so you have to cover the writing.  It‚Äôs a bit tacky but fine if you glue things over the strange writing which could be hate writing.
2.0,"I wear a size 10, 12 normally and ordered a Large.  Too small with an odd fit.  It was like the crotch was short, I was not able to pull them up to my waist.  Returning."
2.0,Pockets came unravels already
2.0,I was very disappointed in the quality and small size. I would not buy this again.
2.0,"Broke way too easily, just fell apart but the design was nice"
2.0,These are too short.
2.0,Earrings are very cute!  I bought them for my daughter.  She loves them but she can‚Äôt wear them for very long and she has little bruise circles on her ears üòî
2.0,Shower only or wear for short periods. The strap adjacent to big toe is very uncomfortable
2.0,The material is too thin a flimsy almost paper thin material too weird feeling when you are working out
2.0,"the material was great and the making of it was great. However, I am short so the arms were too long and the fit around my chest was too tight. I typically wear looser fitting blouses and this was just too small."
2.0,Didn't like these shirts. Very baggy and extremely loose and wide around the collar. Feel cheap. Will be returning.
2.0,"I was disappointed. Not at all like other Jambu shoes that I have bought. These were stiff, plastick-y, very uncomfortable foot bed, but not enough room (in spite of being Wide) for an insert. (Also, I thought I was buying direct from Jambu but these came from ShoeMall.)"
2.0,Cute bracelets but they are NOT yellow.  They‚Äôre at best a yellowish cream color. Very disappointed
2.0,These run a half size too small. They look cheap also. I returned them.
2.0,Was very disappointed in the fit of this so I didn't keep it. I normally wear a 2X and this was no bigger than an extra large.  Looks great in the picture but order a couple sizes larger.
2.0,Completely see through. I wish it had a better lining as I otherwise loved the style.
2.0,Super small! Ordered a size 15 and it barley fit my mom whose a size 7! It does have a good materiel and looks nice it's just too small
2.0,"I‚Äôve tried contacting the company and Amazon but haven‚Äôt gotten any responses so I am writing this review in an attempt to get in touch with customer service. I purchased this item 3 months ago, it looked like a great bye as it is a very nice delicate piece. However over the course of the three months it stretched to the point that it was hanging an inch lower than when I bought it. A couple of weeks ago it finally gave out and the entire thing ripped in half. For something this price it should last more than a couple of months."
2.0,This shirt runs small. Be sure to size up. Had to return. It did not fit my twelve yearold son. Im assuming I would've had to order a large for it to fit him. A medium would not fit though.
2.0,Shirt isn‚Äôt long enough & it‚Äôs too wide.
2.0,Elastic waistband doesn't stay flat.  It's also very thick & uncomfortable.  Feels like cardboard.  Overall - poor quality.
2.0,the strap doesn't seem to hold well
2.0,"Pretty sure this is a men's shirt. I'm normally a woman's large, but this thing is big enough to fit my boyfriend. It would be super cute if it was sized right"
2.0,"Other comments and reviews said this fits very small and to size up, so I did. I normally wear a small and got a medium. Way too big. They also sent the wrong color and pattern. Returning it for a small and hopefully a different style."
2.0,Thin and one of the flags has 5 stars. There are only 4 stars on Chicago flag. Oops
2.0,It is cute but the snaps are plastic and just useless. The barely held it shut for 20mins before they'd come undone. He basically just ended up wearing it as a tucked-in shirt. Seams also showed wear after the first wash.<br /><br />12-18 month size fit my guy pretty well (maybe a little wide) when the snaps were holding. He is perfectly wearing other brand's 12-month sizes.
2.0,"My calfs, at their thickest part are 16 inches around. So not twig legs, but not huge either. I can get these on, but they're stretched tight. The weave of the material would stretch okay, but the very top stitch that runs around the circumference of the top (and bottom) essentially closing off the crochet or knit or whatever, is tight. They would work for arm warmer, and I could make them work for my legs, bare would probably be fine but over leggings (what I really wanted them for) they're tighter than I like.<br />It would be nice if the seller would post measurements so people could know before buying if the item will fit."
2.0,fabric light weight: not a snug fit
2.0,"This is one cheap bikini. Look, I know, I bought a bikini off amazon. What can I expect right. But sometimes amazon surprises you! I was hoping this was the case, but nope. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 125 lbs, 34D for reference. I bought a medium and a large, neither worked. Both tops were identical cup sizes, just longer straps. Poorly stitched seams. The yellow strap on the bikini bottom was longer than the others so it was kind of loose while the bottoms were tight. I can‚Äôt even post a picture because it would not be appropriate for the internet lol. If you‚Äôre a B cup or smaller, try it. Super disappointed in this one, the concept is verrrry cute."
2.0,Pretty flimsy. Looks nice but mine broke fast and leaves a residue on hands
2.0,"Color is very vibrant, which I really like. Short is textured and I don't like that at all. It has no shape at all. Fits right through shoulders and arms, but big through abdomen. Will be returning."
2.0,"I am pretty tall and this shirt was really short on me, like a cropped top.  I'm going to wear it when I workout at home, but unfortunately it just doesn't fit well enough to wear anywhere else."
2.0,Product claims to be unisex but even arrives with the label &#34;Woman's&#34;.  Clearly a woman's turban.
2.0,Backs difficult to  grasp as you trying to put on my daughter
2.0,"I'm going to be sending this back, the zipper is jammed"
2.0,I own two other pairs of tesla pants but these are made completely different. The material on these are semi see through and very thin so I only wore them once.
2.0,"Cute design but poor craftsmanship, particularly around the hip area."
2.0,Looks Very cheap
2.0,"Ordered a 30C, received a 32 with no indication of what cup size it was supposed to be. Seems like they're selling a free-size/general-size/one-size product as specific sizes. I've seen other reviews saying the same thing. Very thinly padded/lined. No wire. Very wide band. Flimsy cups collapse when you touch them. Comes with a band extender attachment in case you need it which could add a couple inches to the back."
2.0,the front pockets have holes after one wearing
2.0,"Actually quality is very cheap -- feels like thin blob of cotton (with holes). My daughter just loved the flapping part; as a cap it is pretty useless, odd on size and non protective."
2.0,"Not what I expected, plus it's too small for a man's wrists."
2.0,I bought this for a family member. Online it shows covering bottom and this shirt doesn't even completely cover her stomach. For all you that wear plus size do not buy this thinking you will get a long shirt.  The shirt looks like they added material to the width and not to the length. Too wide & too short. Very disappointed in this product
2.0,It gets dirty real fast. Wouldn't pay again
2.0,The seams are starting to unravel in two separate places on the sweater. Very warm but cheaply made.
2.0,Product is way too heavy does not conform to the ear you cannot bend this not a good value
2.0,"The socks were easier to put on but I have a big calf and the socks were too small, even at a 2x-3x size."
2.0,"The ring is good but my finger is a size 13, which is what size i ordered but its more like a 15.  way over sized."
2.0,Pretty but there's no way this is a large. Like I literally laughed out loud when I opened and tried it on. The top has to be a small. Im a 38 D and I don't even think a XL would have fit.
2.0,Its not an infinity scarf. Its very cheaply made. I wouldn't waste your money on this. Although the color is true to what it says
2.0,"Size M is a good fit for skinny teen. Picture makes it look like it's a better material. Beware, the cloth is that cheap kind that's very thin and crappy and the paint is a bad print on. Terrible for the price but my daughter liked it anyway. That's all that matters."
2.0,Fits like a diaper on my head.
2.0,"I was very disappointed. I thought the gems would be closer together, like a clover. They are very far apart with an ugly metal plate joining them. I bought it as a gift, I will leave it up to the receiver if she wants to keep it."
2.0,"I have owned many of these watches in the past and loved them.  However, something went wrong with the bands of the last two of them I bought. I was wearing my newest one for just a week when one part of the band became disattached from the watch itself.  I'll be returning it asap.  What gives, Casio?"
2.0,I bought the tortoise version seems like a toy made of cheap flimsy metal. Definitely not worth $16.
2.0,"The print is fine, but the apron is so cheap. It's like the dollar store put this on Amazon for a huge profit. You definitely shouldn't wash this, imo, because it'll fall apart easily."
2.0,"Though it is pretty, THIS IS NOT A BEACH COVERUP UNLESS YOU ARE VERY SHORT AND THIN...maybe this would work for a preteen but not for a curvaceous woman<br />It is also a weird shape and hard to get on and off<br />Very definitely on the small side"
2.0,Thin rough material. One of the seams of the sleeve was completely out of the arm when it arrived. Had already worn the others so don't think I could return.
2.0,"The material is very thin, and the pants are kind of short. The white pants are completely see through. Not worth the price"
2.0,Just a men‚Äôs T-shirt with a screen print
2.0,No tiene un buen polarizado
2.0,To small and disappointingly unattractive
2.0,Misspelled
2.0,It's too small and I purchased the largest size
2.0,This shirt is extremely short. I got a medium and it barely hits my pant line.. definitely not as long as the picture shows. not something you can were with yoga pants unless your okay with showing everything! for reference I'm 5'8 130lb.
2.0,This wallet did not end up being rfid
2.0,"So I‚Äôm giving these a low rating but why is kind of hard to explain. They have these raised seams all over them and you can tell they are cheaply made, like super cheaply made which is disappointing at best. I could have returned them, but I just keep them as backups. Some are better than others. Picture is deceiving, also they are a bit itchy."
2.0,The sunglasses are compatible to other fashion sunglasses. I don't see the benefit of polarized lenses.
2.0,"I wanted to fall in love with this dress, wanted being the key word there. I first ordered according to other reviews and ordered a size too large for me. Return was easy. I then ordered a size four but was sent a size 6, again it was too big. Had they sent the correct size I may have been able to alter the length (which was a tad too long for my preference) and really show this dress off but I decided to send it back and call it quits.<br />The dress will be a show stopper on the right person. For the cost and easy return process, if you‚Äôre on the fence about this one, I say give it a try.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù 120lbs, for reference."
2.0,"I was hoping to get a 46B with cups that fit - but these B-cups are more like C-cups or even bigger. Otherwise, the bras fit nicely."
2.0,Too many wrinkles too remove. Ruined trying to remove wrinkles
2.0,"Good fabric for the price BUT it was HUGE! Ha. I'm 5', 115lbs, 36c/34d. It's not adjustable, it's a faux wrap top with no give. Very boxy and runs very large. Ugh, guess I'll keep trying with stuff on Amazon, not everything is made for petite people."
2.0,"This will be going back.  We bought this for a halloween scene and discovered that in order for this to run, it also plays sound (and it is really freaking loud).  Not what I wanted."
2.0,This dress looks much better in photos.  It is cheaply made and looks more like a costume. The fabric is flimsy and stiff. Very unimpressive.
2.0,"I only gave it two stars because of the sizing. It runs really small. I normally wear a 1x or 2X and clothing, and I ordered a 2X in the robe, and it barely closes in the front. It runs super small. I like it it's really cute just not big enough."
2.0,Great looking but cheap. Charm popped off on its own after a few weeks. It was a waste of money for me.
2.0,I bought an XL and it is snug.  It works well and lucky for me I lost some weight this summer so it fits...but barely.  I ordered from multiple companies and they all fit small.  Be forwarned.
2.0,"The width was correct (I order 18mm), but the strap was about 1 inch shorter than a normal strap. It's too short to wear comfortably on my wrist."
2.0,Love the design but disappointed when that the item isn't true to size. It is 2 sizes off compared to what I normally wear.
2.0,The product is not comfortable wear but liked the idea I am a teacher in a infant room the children were fascinated by the changing colors!!
2.0,Pretty dress. Just sizing is not accurate.
2.0,Es un material que no se estira un producto  de baja calidad
2.0,Not sure if I should have ordered a large size.<br />But material is nice and strong
2.0,I tough it will be bigger but the design is very good i liked it the only and main problem is that I'm not going to use it.
2.0,The blue one fits fine but I guess I dont want to look like laura ingalls wilder today. My boyfriend said I look like Lizzy Borden. I will be returning.
2.0,Camel toe ladies!
2.0,It is super cute and looks very well made but it runs about half a size small if not a full size.
2.0,"It is too thick, and it gets in my way when I am trying to write.  Also makes my arm sweat. It is nice looking that's about all."
2.0,"I have to give these glasses two stars for the fact that they are advertised for children 3-12yo.  These are clearly for children 3-7yo unless your 8+ child has an exceptionally small head.<br /><br />**Seller, please adjust your product description accordingly -- Amazon has a great return policy but you have now created an errand for me that I really didn't need."
2.0,My daughter is tall for her age so I always order up a size or two for length. I did the same here and the length is still above her ankles. Also there is an odd defect in the fabric. It looks like there is a string on the cloth but it‚Äôs a color defect. Very odd.
2.0,They broke the 2nd week I had them cheap frames
2.0,They are a bit baggy
2.0,"This shirt does run bigger than expected. I normally wear a medium / large and I could of bought a small. Fabric is different, probably won‚Äôt shrink"
2.0,I am always a xs. Most stuff doesn't fit me on Amazon if it only offers a small but this small was too small to get up all the way....
2.0,Pattern is cute but dress is completely straight no flare as shown in picture.
2.0,"Made 2 sizes smaller then marked, couldn't get my feet in them at all. Marked 10.5 men's when they are actually about size 8"
2.0,Super cute but DOES NOT stay latched in place. It just randomly pops off. VERY ANNOYING! I lobe the pattern but that‚Äôs the only good thing I can say!
2.0,Too small but liked style
2.0,Not as nice as the silver cheap looking
2.0,but it was real short. i am 5&#34;8
2.0,Returned it. Straps in the back won‚Äôt stay in place which made it uncomfortable to walk in. Cute shoes though.
2.0,"When I 1st started using it, it was very shiny. The color fades super fast and then it kinda looks like there some yellow layer on the shinny surface."
2.0,I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù there is way too much at the bottom so now I have to have it altered. $$$
2.0,Love the fit on these but the button was defective & kept popping off. Order down because they run big.
2.0,Very short waisted.
2.0,"Too thin for spin class. If u take spin, you know what I mean. Might be good for other workouts, but I bought these w/ spin in mind."
2.0,Ordered women's size 7.5-8/ men's size 6.5-7.. Fits Dad size 10.5
2.0,I read this happening to someone else and thought it wouldn‚Äôt happen to me. Sure enough‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the cheapest tiniest piece of plastic that holds the lenses to the frames
2.0,Ordered my usual size panty but this fits as if 2 sizes smaller...disappointed in Maidenform.
2.0,"If you look at the product image, you can see only one side is adjustable. The other side needs to be sewn in. I missed it. Either be prepared to sew with fairly strong thread or look elsewhere."
2.0,It is just alright.  Nothing to brag about.
2.0,I would say for the size I purchased for my daughter that‚Äôs usually her size ‚Ä¶. It ran a one size smaller and it doesn‚Äôt stretch at all. Another problem is the zipper it gets stuck for her every time‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a cheap zipper. Overall thought it‚Äôs soft and nice color.
2.0,Two of the earrings were broken not at all satisfied!
2.0,Uneven hemline. Nice colors and flow but the waist to length ratio seemed like it was made for only very skinny middle height people.
2.0,A little too busty for this one. This would be a good one for somebody who's a little bit smaller.
2.0,"I assumed the hoops closed but they don't so they look strange and don't fit correctly, for me. The corkscrew style is super hard for me to get in. The &#34;L&#34; shape is good though."
2.0,Are they supposed to have sequins missing on them?? I just recieved mines today and they have spots with them not there and it's very noticeable.
2.0,I‚Äôve been wearing the Mickey Mouse watch band for about 3 weeks. It is super cute but the design is peeling off the watch band. It started about a week ago right near the clasp and now on the other side it‚Äôs peeling off one side. The price was certainly good but you won‚Äôt be able to wear these daily.
2.0,Runs small and came with 3 stains on the shirt. Going to return it.
2.0,The color and material of this shirt were nice but I found the fit too big and loose for my taste so decided to return it.
2.0,Fits great feels great but even though I have a very short torso this is still way to short. The corset stops above my belly button and frankly for a bigger girl that's not a good look
2.0,Super cute and my 2 year old LOVED them but they don't fit right... the padding in bottom part separates almost and slouches to the side so they are very uncomfortable unfortunately .
2.0,Product did not provide anti-fogging that was expected.
2.0,"They should show sideviews. Not sure how old the foam was, but now I know where the foam packing on electronics comes from."
2.0,"I'm 5'9 150lbs and ordered a large. The fit was fine, but it was a high rise pair of shorts, and as a result just kept riding up. Every time I stood after sitting had to pull the shorts down and out of my butt which was really uncomfortable so I'm returning."
2.0,Much lower cut than the picture indicated. Skimpy fit -- tight on my size 9 1/2 foot. I don't believe the claim that they're 80% cotton -- they don't really feel like there's any cotton at all.
2.0,Fall apart very easily!  Not well made
2.0,"I liked the style of the dress, and what I didn‚Äôt like about the dress it was too big. I gave it to my sister to wear. I brought it for my mother‚Äôs funeral‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
2.0,"The LED lights came in , as i was unpackaging the product. i realized 2 out of 10 of the lights did not work . sad moment. very disappointed and annoyed because these are priced at 50$ and for the product not to be at its best not to happy."
2.0,The sizes run very small. The design and material are great but the fit expected does matter.
2.0,one was to big and one was to small  Returned them but have not received my credit.
2.0,Material is itchy and was too large
2.0,Not what I expected too thin material feels cheap
2.0,"How are you supposed to catch em all with only one glove. Top and hat are fine, the only glove we received was very poor quality."
2.0,"Not as shown.  Picture purple with metallic marbling.  Actual earrings almost black, no marbling.  Feather really short.  Easy return."
2.0,Does not keep time. Does not wind easy.
2.0,"The wallet is fine, but the ID pocket is super tight. I literally almost need a pair of pliers to get my ID out.<br /><br />Also, on hot days, the three slanted sections for cards on the front seem to ooze glue onto my cards. The glue is pretty hard to remove.  Isopropyl won't get it off.<br /><br />Functionally, as a wallet to carry cards and cash, it‚Äôs fine. But if I can‚Äôt remove my cards when I need them...what's the point?"
2.0,They are alright they roll down if u wearing jeans on top..i wear them for the winter to keep my bottom legs warm but after 1 or 2 hrs of use the roll down
2.0,"loved the necklace, got lots of compliments except the first time i wore it the chain broke"
2.0,These socks are tight! They do not feel like cotton at all. Overall disappointed. Not comfortable.
2.0,"It's cute and I love that sleeves BUT I'm normally an XL so that's what I ordered.  I can barely even squeeze in enough to try it on.  Also.. the silver on the zipper and zipper pull is really bright, brighter than shown.. I'm just not a fan.  I may have tried to color it somehow if it was a good fit but I'll just return it.  I'm 5'3 and so the XL was really really long too.  Just not good for short & bigger girls, in my opinion."
2.0,I ordered two pairs for work and loved them but I haven‚Äôt even had them for three moths yet and the seams are falling apart on one pair. Was so excited to find a pair of comfortable pants that were long enough but now am extremely disappointed.
2.0,"It almost feels like plastic, it's not absorbent really. It takes in enough water to freeze you when your movement makes you rub against it. It's very stiff even after being washed 4 or 5 times. Not happy at all. Also, it isn't very adjustable. There are large pieces of velcro on the top so if it's too big or too small it probably won't fit correctly. Especially if you are large breasted."
2.0,Non-stretchy fabric & fit much smaller than expected. Can't wear it.......Pretty material though.
2.0,"my daughter only wore them once, but I guess they served a purpose."
2.0,The slippers were way too tight.  I will be returning them which is disappointing because I am finding slippers that are either too small or too big.
2.0,A lot smaller than I expected and it‚Äôs not a functioning watch.
2.0,The yellow is BRIGHT yellow. I returned it.
2.0,Necklace broke at the banquet
2.0,"I offered the one with a mesh on the side. Very cute, fit well, though too short (size S) for my 6ft hight. But this is not such a big deal. In fact, the problem is that when I tried these leggings on, the mesh on the sides on both legs had tears in multiple areas. I did not were it yet - just tried it on. I was very disappointed. The leggings did not seem to be a return... So  I guess it is just a bad quality mesh... I will try to order plain leggings not. Hopefully they are better."
2.0,"The only thing right is the material. The elastic at the waist is to tight, the waist itself goes all the way under my arms and I have to rolled it if I don't want to look like I popped in my pants or to let the pants a good 10"" too long just clean the floor... It's really a shame because the textile itself is really comfortable."
2.0,It looks good but hurts rlly bad its good for a quick pic but it gets painful and the magnet leaves a smell &lt;/3
2.0,"They may be good quality, packaging was nice, but the color was off.<br />The shoe strings were labeled red...they are orange, yes, a red orange, but orange. The picture looks red, but they are orange. The label on the shoe strings reads red, but they are orange."
2.0,To big. It is adjustable but it is still way to big. Cute but to big
2.0,"I loved this dress so much! It wasn't to short, the top was adorable, but the bottom was completely see through. I contemplated buying a slip to go under it, but I ended up just sending it back. Also the sleeves are longer than you'd expect, but I have short arms so that may have just been me."
2.0,Was very soft ! Ran large
2.0,The quality of the product is a bit lower than expected.
2.0,"I received this brown 100% leather men‚Äôs belt and I have a few things to say about it.  First, the emblem on the belt buckle is really strange.  Originally I thought it was some kind of tan sticker, or even scratches because it‚Äôs so small and I still don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs supposed to be.  Secondly, I‚Äôm not a fan of the red and white random stitching around the buckle and third and fourthly, it‚Äôs really wide (and thick) and extremely stiff.  Perhaps it would soften up with use, but right now it‚Äôs so stiff and wide it and it doesn‚Äôt really fit my husband‚Äôs Levi or LL Bean jeans belt loops.  I‚Äôm sure we can get it to fit them, but it wouldn‚Äôt look natural.  The one good thing I liked is that it comes with a nice little drawstring bag to keep the belt in.  That‚Äôs about the best thing I can say about this belt.  Unfortunately, this item isn‚Äôt as hoped it was."
2.0,I like it but they sent the wrong color.
2.0,"I did not like these shoes. They seemed to be sub par for a designer shoe, especially DKNY shoes. The material on the top is really hard and plastic looking, almost like it will crack where it bends. And they‚Äôre not comfortable at all. Very stiff. Not impressed at all"
2.0,"Either this fits a little loosely, or I've lost more weight than I realize. It's a nice, thin layer to wear under my scrubs.<br /><br />EDIT: After only ONE WASH (cold water, tumble dry low/no heat) the neck has completely split apart and there are three layers of fabric visible. I will still wear these under my scrubs, but I will not wear them out and about so the neckline shows."
2.0,I ordered this for my girlfriend a bit larger thinking it was Chinese sizing- bad choice. If she had enormous implants it would have been ok but I‚Äôm not sure anyone outside of that category would be a good match for this garment.
2.0,"First of all, it was totally my fault for not looking at the description more closely. I was intending to order a pair of ear climbers so when I just received one I was disappointed. But like I said, that goof was on my part as the description does state that it was ""1 pc"". That being said, one climber just didn't give me the look I was going for and was not comfortable wearing for longer than a few minutes. Perhaps my ears are not shaped to wear climbers such as this...I do hate giving a low review, especially when the product is beautiful and well made. The review is more for the fact that it was not comfortable and I think the description could be a bit more clear. On a side note, since ordering this item I now see that the description has been updated and now there is the option to buy a pair. I wish that had been the case when I ordered this earlier this year."
2.0,Very thin and see thru.  It was very small- maybe half the material that is pictured.  I wouldn't waste your money.
2.0,This tie is smaller than advertised.
2.0,"Very stiff, not worth the money."
2.0,Sheds like no other.
2.0,Tried sweater on. With a black t-shirt under. Took some time to brush all the lint off. Returned sweater.
2.0,The neckline is way to lg
2.0,Good fit. Give 2 stars because of inaccurate description. This was supposed to be 55 % cotton. 00
2.0,"Cons:<br />The brush is small ( My hands are not that big either). It's hard to keep a good grip when scrubbing.<br />The soap foams fast and looks like it's doing it's job but doesn't really get much clean (You don't need to use much, which is a +)<br />Towel is unnecessary.<br /><br />Pros:<br />My bathroom likes nice with Jason Markk products in it now. I feel more of a sneaker head.<br />It did a good job of cleaning the white tougher parts. To be fair, I think a regular cleaner and rag would have done the same.<br /><br />Pass!"
2.0,If you have big boobs this will not work for you. I usually wear a medium but ordered a size up because of my boobs that are a DD and the dress was pulling so bad
2.0,"It looks exactly like the picture, but a jewel fell out on day #2. Pretty cheap necklace."
2.0,"I bought 0-3 months. She‚Äôll probably be able to wear it in 6 more months, after Halloween AND Christmas. And why exactly is 0-3 months size more expensive than other sizes???Very disappointed. Will be returning this."
2.0,The lettering came off after the first wash.
2.0,"This dress is very tight across the hips and below.  I usually wear a size small (4/6) and have a normally proportioned figure.  Going by the product measurements (shoulder and bust) this dress should have worked. Though the top is fine, the rest is way too tight.  I ask the manufacturers to please put the hip measurements in the product description as well as a side and back photos so customers can see what they are buying.  I also found the material to be scratchy and not high quality."
2.0,Too small thats all.  If they had larger lens I'd buy!
2.0,Way shorter then expected
2.0,"The suit fit fine. However, the pattern was different and the color MUCH darker that what is on the website. I didn't like it all and returned it."
2.0,"Ordered the size I wear. When these came they were too short and tight. Emailed company and they asked for my inseam. Told them it's 33&#34; and they said 31.5&#34; is as large as they make. They said they were made for Chinese size individuals. Said I would like to return for refund. They suggested a 50% refund, I said no. They suggested that I just give them to someone, I said no. Then they sent me the return label for somewhere in China. This was about 3 days worth of emails back and forth. The pants seemed nice enough but I did not even trust them to refund my money so in the end I just gave them to my nephew. Bought a pair of Carhart work pants Khaki and really like them, a lot cheaper too. Buyer beware!"
2.0,"Flimsy quality, cheap material and the seam on the side was faulty, mishandled."
2.0,I no this ain't real but it was faded before I wore it
2.0,Too small for the size I ordered.
2.0,Material was thin and not sturdy
2.0,On the small size.
2.0,"I just wear it for 1 hour and feel hurt on the silicon band part. It is too tight. I did not feel any compression on my leg except the silicon band. Sorry, I have to return it."
2.0,"I bought this watch because it said it would come with a bracelet, neither the bracelet nor the pin arrived to lengthen it, only the tool arrived. Fortunately, 2 links came and I was able to adjust it. I give it 2 stars because neither the bracelet nor the pin arrived."
2.0,The shoe was small. The emblem wasn‚Äôt centered correctly on one shoe. To return costs more than half the price of the shoe.
2.0,One thing the tread came apart at the top of the umbrella had to re sew  it all the way around it
2.0,Really puffy. Not at all like photo.  The waist band is also a different color from the skirt. Will be returning it.
2.0,I loved this band and bumper screen protector but the band broke on me within a week. I‚Äôm still using the screen bumper but had to use a old band.
2.0,"For the price, I was expecting something of higher quality. This is a toy for young children. Or for easily impressed teens. I wanted to give it as a Christmas gift for my 14y/o daughter who is very much into Dr Who. When I received it and opened the package, I was very disappointed.<br />On the bright side, the return process was painless and the credit was issued immediately."
2.0,Wayyyyyyy too small. I gave it to my daughter. The colors were true but I guess I need to start paying closer attention to whether or not something is shown in US sizes or not.
2.0,"The designs are cute but the size doesn‚Äôt seem right. I was only able to use two of these, as they screw into place. The others were slightly large and won‚Äôt fit my size 2."
2.0,"somewhat small for a large and material not as soft as other Hanes products,"
2.0,"It‚Äôs ok. The fit was as expected. The red color was nice. I am tall with long arms and the sleeves were ‚Äúpassably‚Äù long enough for me. I just didn‚Äôt like the texture. It seems like it would be a really warm sweater, but it‚Äôs acrylic and not very warm. All the little waffle weave holes make it not warm at all. I‚Äôll be returning it."
2.0,"Two of the inside zippers seems to no work correctly, have to leave them open to avoid breaking it."
2.0,"Runs small and seems to shrink, so it feels tight.  Leg part of fabric rises when you walk."
2.0,"It looked thin in the picture but when it arrived, i was shocked. The width was wide, the stone was big. Hard to open and close and you have to be thin to wear this ‚ÄúWonder Woman type ‚Äú bracelet ."
2.0,What a waste of money üôáüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2.0,I bought this to use as a wrap at work because it's so cold in the building. This works well as a wrap but it leaves tufts of material wherever it lies so I barely use it.
2.0,bought two units to receive one decent unit
2.0,This was an order for 6 pieces. There were only 4 in my order.
2.0,The quality is nice- color is great- too bad the size is so off.
2.0,Oreldered a 2x.  Way to tight.  My daughter is a medium and fits her perfectly.
2.0,It‚Äôs a very low-quality material for the price.
2.0,"I love the colors and the fabric and it arrived quici, so 2 stats.  But I laughed when I took it out of the bag.  I even checked my order to make sure I hadn't ordered the wrong size.  Ordered a medium and it fits like an XXL.  I'm 5'7"" and 130 lbs.  This dragged the ground, even with heels.  I had a good 10 extra inches around the waist (the elastic didn't hug my body) and the back of the halter that should have fit at my rib cage was so loose, it hung below the waistline.  I'll reorder, but not sure a small will be small enough."
2.0,"Looks inflatable but it isn't. Very cheaply made, but what do u expect for the price. Glad I didn't need it for anything important as it looks nothing like the picture"
2.0,Quality control could use some improvement.  Buttons were crooked and had to be removed and resewn.  Meh....don't waste your time.
2.0,Well I really like the feel of the socks and the look they're very cute. But they are very small for women socks so be careful on who you buy them for because they are small and I don't think they'd fit any foot bigger than an eight and a half maybe
2.0,Way shorter than expected. Has huge buttons with the word &#34;rico&#34; on them. Nice fabric though.
2.0,"I have very mixed feelings about this product.  It was pretty at first (first few months), but after a while, I noticed the color changing and getting dull looking. Overall, it's pretty though,  just not the dullness after wearing it for awhile."
2.0,"Hard material, not easy to put on"
2.0,If you are heavy chested this is not for you
2.0,"Was brought to believe it would look real, it does not. Very disappointed"
2.0,"According to the measurements i ordered  xxl ,im usually size l/xl and it still runs supper small the dress. I cant close the zipper and the color is not what it shows in the pictures. Not worth the money."
2.0,"The cut and color are pretty, but a tiny hole appeared on the side of the dress the very first time I wore it (to work! Nothing extraordinary). It‚Äôs not noticeable now but is sure to stretch. Disappointing as it would be a nice dress otherwise."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:33496e10565457155316aef9ec89d2c8]] I just wish they didnt have ‚Äúmetal‚Äù as a part of the description. The gold part isn‚Äôt metal. The backside is. The gold part looks like resin. It‚Äôs matte. Very dull and it doesn‚Äôt shine. It‚Äôs not metal!<br />And it‚Äôs a really small face, so if you have big hands don‚Äôt get this watch. It‚Äôs for small handed people"
2.0,When I bought this i looked at the comments and i went with an XL. With tops I‚Äôm a size 40D. Once I got it the top fit like a small. The bottoms fit fine
2.0,Color was pretty. Material not as expected!
2.0,I was pretty disappointed when I got this. It‚Äôs not near as full as the picture shows. It‚Äôs pretty cheap to be honest. But I got what I paid for.ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èIf you are looking for a thicker slip type than this would be good.
2.0,Broke in 2 days. Don't buy.
2.0,"These earrings look just as pictured, I got them for an 80s party. However, within an hour one fell out. I found the back and put it back in, it fell out again. So someone else gave me an earring back and by the end of the night I had no earrings and I clue where they went. Disappointed."
2.0,Short but like it
2.0,"Seemed like good quality, was slightly smaller than similar Ray Bans, broke after about 50 days from normal wear.  I cannot recommend unless you have a smaller face.  Go get the real thing."
2.0,Itchy and not oversized as pictured. Size Large fits like a medium
2.0,The shirt is not long as it shows in this photo.
2.0,I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô5 but this bathing suit gives no where near the tummy coverage shown in the picture.
2.0,The product itself is very cute but the size in the listing is not correct. It says the socks are for 2T-4T but the actual socks are for shoe size 4-7 which corresponds to 12 to 24 months.<br /><br />We ended up having to give them away to friends who have a newborn.
2.0,The bottom of the dress was sewn on backwards. There‚Äôs a huge seam down the front of the skirt
2.0,I did like it a lot. Sadly because it's an open ring I lost it the second day üòû I will buy it again
2.0,These shorts are not true to size they were way too small and short for me! Order a size up!
2.0,They looked great on me but both nose pieces broke off within one week.. cheap production/ material
2.0,Don't like this bag. The zipper is hidden and covered with the top part and hard to locate. You really can't throw this bag over your shoulder like bags I'm used to and it has 2 extra straps that I suppose are to secure the top from coming undone but it is not necessary.
2.0,"My husband's sunglasses arrived today and well, okay nothing special. They are lightweight but I'm not sure that's a plus. Just not the quality I was expecting for the price. They appear more like what I would find at a Walmart but at a much lower price than what I paid. The case also was nice but the zipper Is broke. Not impressed."
2.0,So baught this product for work they seem to run small then I got looking the material is see through if baught probably buy 1 size bigger
2.0,"Honestly I should‚Äôve expected much, the shirts fits good as expected, the problem is the material isn‚Äôt really the best, it‚Äôs not the worse either it‚Äôs kinda average. The biggest problem is the neck, the space makes the shirt look kinda ridiculous but it‚Äôs a decent shirt"
2.0,"So. I like the watch for the most part,  it for my son who has some disabilities. BUT, the time keeps changing! I have reset the time 3 times in the last 2 days of having the watch! So that's annoying!"
2.0,"Great compression, however the armed holes are weird. the edges are rough and flare out. It became uncomfortable enough that my son didn't want to continue wearing them."
2.0,"Pants feel great and nice stretch except the waist band. No give at waist Band and it runs small, ordered a size bigger than my other pants and these are too tight"
2.0,"I'm giving this shirt 2 stars because the sizing was accurate and the cut is attractive and flattering. However, I was very disappointed in the look and feel of the fabric - the sleeves in particular are made from a cheap and coarse-feeling polyester. It's quite shiny, not comfortable against your skin, and is very obviously cheap and synthetic. The torso fabric is better but is definitely a mostly-polyester blend, so I think the description that says this is 65% cotton and 35% polyester is just plain false. It doesn't feel like there's any cotton in there at all - feels and looks very synthetic. Also, as you can see from the attached photos, what looks like a heathered fabric in the sleeves in the seller's photos is actually sort of a pebbled pattern that only accentuates the cheap look of the fabric.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rough and unattractive polyester fabric makes this a pretty useless garment, because it's too cheap looking to wear out, and not comfortable enough to wear around the house. Not sure it's worth the hassle to return this but if I can I will."
2.0,Really liked this lanyard until it started turning my neck green.
2.0,Cheesy. Not a vintage shirt at all lol
2.0,Did  not look very realistic
2.0,So many good uses and still more left for later uses.
2.0,"Fun concept, poor execution. It‚Äôs extremely oversized, even after sizing down. Also, and more problematic, is that the edges of the sleeves and the skirt are unhemmed, which makes the dress look unfinished. I will fix the sleeves and hem and wear at the pool as a coverup, but I don‚Äôt feel that  it‚Äôs really appropriate for regular wear."
2.0,"I was very disappointed with the way this dress fit. After taking time to lace the back, I thought I was going to try it on. The satin part underneath wouldn't go past my chest. I usually wear size 14 dress. I ordered size 16. In this dress, I would probably have needed at least a size 20."
2.0,Really cute suspenders for my ski pants but sadly they didn't hold up. One of the metal claps has started popping open after only 20 uses. It releases for no reason. Oh well.
2.0,It turns
2.0,This watch broken December 2018.  I've had it only a little over a year when it broke.  The spoke that manages changing the time does not work.  It's a pretty watch but now it's just a band that does not tell time.  I took care of this watch and now it does not work.  it should have lasted much longer.
2.0,"Based on the size guide, an XS would fit a 26 waist. I‚Äôm a 24 but I figured it might be close enough, but these actually run WAY small and even the extra small was too small for me when it should have been larger based on the description. On top of that they were not full length and were actually closer to capris. To be fair the quality seems good and the material is nice, but I wouldn‚Äôt buy this unless you have very short legs and be aware you should be sizing up. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 around 115 for reference."
2.0,"I chose this tight for my daughter because it states &#34;100% cotton&#34;.  My daughter has very sensitive skin and cannot stand anything other than 100% cotton.  Turns out after we got the product that it's 72% cotton, 26% nylon and 2% elastane!"
2.0,I am giving this 2 stars because when I opened the package and pulled out the shirt it had a horrible strong chemical smell to it. I washed it 3 times and it still smells like chemicals. It fits good and I like it but could not wear it due to the strong smell:(
2.0,"Purchased this for my nephew.  Arrived timely, fit well and good quality.  Why the 2 stars?  The WHITES of Deadpool's Fish eyes were not there.  Just all black where the eyes should be. Took the &#34;attitude&#34; away from the shirt, which is really why we liked it.  Not going to return it, but wish it hadn't been defective."
2.0,I guess I was expecting a more cotton type of feel. It‚Äôs like straight polyester or something and slippery. They look a bit cheap and fit oddly weird.
2.0,Lasted me less than a year before the soles ripped
2.0,Shoes were way smaller than the size I ordered. Had to return.
2.0,"I ordered the shoes for a Halloween costume. They fit perfectly, but half way through my night the top part with the straps came unglued from the bottom platform. I guess I should have expected that seeing as the product was so cheap. I liked the look they added to my outfit, but I wish they would have held up better."
2.0,"I'm not saying that the vendor lied or anything. They never said &#34;no line bifocals&#34;. And their pictures DO show the lines. But they do claim that the glasses are very fashionable.  The problem is that the reader-lenses are attached on the OUTSIDE of the glasses, making them extremely noticeable.  I bought two other styles of bifocal sunglasses in the same order, including http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FQTRAHG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  These glasses are far more attractive, as the reader lenses are attached on the INSIDE.<br />Again, I'm not saying that Very Hobby claimed that the bifocal lenses are unnoticeable. I'm just saying that, if you do NOT want the reader lenses to be obvious, do NOT buy these glasses."
2.0,"I would have to agree with others, it's not waterproof and it's on the cheap side. So if you're looking for something waterproof this is not a good fit"
2.0,This was too small and I am in process of returning it.
2.0,Medium fits like a small. Size up two sizes if you want it loose.
2.0,"These are NOT 8mm beads.  6mm at best,  It's a good size for women, not men."
2.0,"As pretty as these are in the picture, they are super super small. I should have read the reviews as these would fit and look normal on a small child. Just felt like these are a little misleading."
2.0,Definitely not worth the money.  This was a cheaply printed hoodie.  Took way too long to ship.  Pass on this one.
2.0,"The skirt was too small so I returned it, received my refund.  I just received an email stating that if I didn't return the skirt my account was going to be charged.<br />How could a refund be paid if the item wasn't processed and returned?<br />This is been an unsettling experience."
2.0,"Style was as pictured and is what I was looking for.  However, the polyester fabric looks cheap and VERY polyester."
2.0,The gloves were a disappointment. The effects were difficult & not interesting.
2.0,"These might work well but hard to know because they were too big. I measured at 29‚Äù so I bought a size down, as instructed. However, they were still too big. Also, the sticky strips were stuck together and I had to pull apart with some force to try them on... afraid this may have caused an issue later down the road had I been able to wear them. Going to try again...Ordering at least 1-2 sizes smaller than what I originally purchased."
2.0,"Very cheap, paint wearing off, no battery in it, way too big for my wrist can't even wear it unless I get it resized"
2.0,I ordered the glasses for a vacation and they looked super cute. When I un boxed them they are broken. Sucks because I have no time to return and exchange for new pair before I had to leave.
2.0,Love the shirt but it's way too short. I have to wear a zipped up jacket with it otherwise it would be an awkward in between between a regular shirt and a crop top
2.0,Just ok.  Runs small and wrinkles easily.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"It's not the same dress on the picture, I ordered a large and it was too big and extremely long"
2.0,"Overall the wallet has a very nice layout, it holds a decent number of cards and cash without getting bulky.  The reason I‚Äôm giving it two stars is because the pull tab to access the credit cards started to detach and become and issue within the first month.  It‚Äôs exactly what I wanted it just didn‚Äôt hold up."
2.0,I felt like the color of this shirt in person did not match the color on screen. It was more like an olive/black color. Because of that I sent it back.
2.0,Extremely short! Can‚Äôt bend over at all!
2.0,Sizes runs alot smaller than chart
2.0,Very cheaply made. The pin breaks and the clasp doesn't hold. Very disappointed.
2.0,Felt baggy and awkward. Maybe not for taller people.
2.0,"Waist rolls down,  legs ride up.  Uncomfortable.  I will not buy again"
2.0,If u stretch it too much the bead will fall off! one of the bracelet has already ripped by the second ise... So buy it only if u really really need it or else skip this product completely
2.0,"It's cute, but really I thought it was going to be more of a turquoise stone, rather than a print out of the image with a clear stone covering it. I guess for 10$ you can't expect much more than that. Oh well."
2.0,It looks just like I expected but it's made for petite size ladies. Plus size may have a problem like I did. I could wear it but I would have to purchase an extender. It's not bad for the price though
2.0,I loved this dress except the breast area was meant for someone who may be a B. I am a D. So it looks weird on me being tight af on the boobies and loose everywhere else. I was kind of hoping when you go up in size the chest also increases
2.0,"Very nice, high quality purse.  Roomy inside with sturdy zippers.  My only critique, and it‚Äôs kind of a major one is that I wish the strap was longer.  For a crossbody it‚Äôs pretty short.<br /><br />Update:  Strap ripped from purse after owning for only a few months.  The Sak provided great customer service and is offering a replacement.<br /><br />Update 2: After a few months of use the replacement ripped in the same place.  This is actually kind of a poorly made crossbody and not meant to withstand continuous crossbody use."
2.0,They felt good for one day then you could feel the tred through the insole. No better than Wal-Mart slippers in fact they appear as the same slipper or even worse and twice the cost.
2.0,It‚Äôs s bit small. The collar is not very good looking in my opinion. Oh well. Color was nice tho
2.0,Holes in several pairs.
2.0,Thin and color drab.
2.0,"I got this for a friend, and it was super embarrassing when I handed her the amazon package to open and it had a ONE EYED UNICORN in it. I'm not sure why it would only have one eye, but it did. :("
2.0,"Ordered a medium because of the sizing reviews, but I should have stuck to my normal size of a small. I'm 5 2 and 140. The reall offputting thing about these is that the material is a glossy polyester stretch blend, not how the model picture shows, more like the close up fabric photo but magnified. Cute for the price, but it still looks cheap."
2.0,Too loose and slip down. No any significant shin protection as promised. Got a hole after a few uses.
2.0,This is soooooo tiny! I ended up giving it to my 5yo to wear.
2.0,Just didn't work for me with my glasses.  Might work good for others.
2.0,Left terrible green stains on my skin within a few hours and cut my neck
2.0,"I gave it two stars because it‚Äôs soft and comfortable, not itchy (like it looks like it‚Äôll be out of the package). However, it‚Äôs beyond unflattering. I looked like a round stiff bubble straight out of Gryffindor. The color is so off as well as the fit. Doesn‚Äôt look anything like the advertised picture. For reference: I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 184 pounds & I got a size XL for the loose fit look. Big fail & will be returning."
2.0,"The fabric is not so great and you can see the lines of the thread and where everything were sewed... its poorly made and the price is too high for it, its not worth the money."
2.0,"I am so disappointed in these leggings. I was super excited to get this three pack, and very excited that they came for such a value for three pairs of high waisted leggings in neutral colors.<br /><br />First, the good: the fabric feels nice, very silky and smooth. I do tend to prefer a more cottony fabric for my leggings, but this fabric is fine! The leggings have plenty of stretch but also a nice firm hold, so I have no doubt that if the fit were right these would look great on. These are also nice and thick, so I have no doubt that they aren‚Äôt see through.<br /><br />Now, for the bad‚Ä¶.the SIZING! I absolutely can‚Äôt wear them at all. As in, there‚Äôs no saving these. I would normally wear a small in leggings, and I both paid attention to reviews that said the leggings ran true to US sizing as well as measured myself before ordering according to the size chart. I fell exactly in range for the size Small, which was really no surprise, since that‚Äôs what I would usually wear anyway. When I received these though, they were ENORMOUS! I in no way can wear the small. They are just too big. I definitely need the extra small, and I‚Äôm so disappointed. The leggings aren‚Äôt even just too big in one area; they are too big everywhere. I don‚Äôt know if there was a labeling mistake with the ones sent to me or what, but I am very sad that I can‚Äôt wear these. They are MANY inches too large in the waist, as well as noticeably too big in other areas as well. I‚Äôm not very curvy, so Asian made clothing usually fits me very nicely, but these leggings were an exception. Sadly, I can‚Äôt recommend these leggings at all, which is unfortunate because the fabric does feel nice, and price-wise, they are a good deal. In terms of size though, you are taking your chances! I don‚Äôt recommend these."
2.0,"They're beautiful on. Love the way they look. Not sure if they're sterling silver, though. I have sensitive ears. Have to wear sterling silver or gold.<br /><br />If I wear them for even an hour,  my ears swell up huge and  very painfully. They're so pretty, I've tried many times with the same results.<br /><br />The studs, at least, can't be sterling silver. Very disappointing."
2.0,It says XL and is less than small
2.0,there not a good fit at all I have small feet they only come up to my ankles wouldn't recommend
2.0,Looks like a party city costume. Poorly made
2.0,"I do really like this set, but the quality of the seams is not good. After wearing once & washing on gentle once there is a large hole in the inside thigh in the seam of the pants."
2.0,Not at all what I expected. Was very small and and poor quality. Oh well
2.0,I love the look of this necklace but it falls apart every time I wear it.
2.0,Much shorter in the front than I expected.
2.0,These are like neon rave color. Not a fan
2.0,"They look great, good size, and arrived quickly. Had to go back and order a second one because I didn‚Äôt realize they were sold individually but that was my fault. Con is that one of them completely bent when I tried to close it in my daughters ear and the other one keeps opening up randomly so I‚Äôm afraid she will lose it."
2.0,The design is nice but the quality is below low. Nothing aligns right. The zipper is on the wrong side for male clothing. The zipper also ends too high and misaligns with the opposite side. Maybe good enough to keep you warm at home but wouldn‚Äôt wear in public.
2.0,to small to read for me
2.0,"I gave it two stars because the description is misleading.<br /><br />Look it's a reasonable 20mm watch band. BUT BUT BUT if you are going to buy a watch band WITHOUT the Samsung quick release and just use the normal spring bars then ANY, and I mean ANY, 20mm watch band will do. It is not a Samsung Gear S3 watch band. The wording is technically correct, it is a REPLACEMENT watch band for the Samsung Gear S3, but in spirit wrong. You are led to believe that this is a specific watch band for the Samsung Gear S3, it isn't specifically any more than ANY 20mm watch band is a replacement for the Samsung Gear S3 Watch band. Nuff said."
2.0,"Yikes. I was really hoping to luck out here for $8, but you get what you pay for. The tag is clearly visible on the back (pictured) and that‚Äôs without squatting. These are an odd fit. The waist band isn‚Äôt very comfortable and that would be a nightmare bending and all in yoga. If you‚Äôre a size 8 and below, you could wear these, but if you‚Äôre bigger than that and curvy like me, these are a no-go."
2.0,"Ordered red,  which looks like dark red on the picture. However  received tomato red, what is absolutely different. Quality of material looks cheap. ON the other hand consistent with price."
2.0,"Great colors and soft when you first get it. However, after one wash it‚Äôs less soft and the fit around the ankle loosens so it‚Äôs not durable."
2.0,It's bit bright - so if you like to stand out than this is the color for you!
2.0,Gauge is a perfect fit but the circumference of the hoop is too big for my nose. Was very sad. Fast shipping though.
2.0,Nice fit but poor quality. Looks cheap!
2.0,They look like they have been painted with gold spray paint.
2.0,Nice but not as supportive as what I was looking for
2.0,"I did not like these glasses.  A lot of time and effort was put into the sunglass carrier but not the sunglasses.  The sunglasses are way to light in weight.  If you make certain moves or even bend down, the glasses will lift off your nose.  You have to constantly keep on pushing them back on your nose.  I would avoid these glasses."
2.0,"First, this took forever. Second, the colors seem different than what is in the picture."
2.0,"***Updated 5/11**<br />The large suitcase from the replacement set sent, unfortunately, did not last two 2 hour flights and is broken after it's first use. I had items that could not have been easily replaced had the suitcase failed entirely and broken apart. Even before the trip the combination lock did not work, the middle number wheel just spins freely. I will be returning the set.<br /><br />**Updated 4/16**<br />I was contacted by the company after initiating a return. They did send out a replacement set that arrived in a week. Thank you for the prompt customer service.**<br />Received on a Friday for a road trip on 3 days later. Zipper compartment in large suitcase apparently unable to withstand the weight of 4 pair of women's undies, 3 pair of socks and a 6 hour car ride and is already ripping, unfortunately, and case is not even close to being overpacked. Afraid I will have to return. Zippers seem to stick a bit on large one, too. Material feels flimsy, and the wheels on the large case were already dirty out of the box, I hope I wasn't sent a used set. That being said the large case is pretty roomy. Wish there was a handle on the bottom of the case."
2.0,Cheapo material. Do not buy.
2.0,Shirt felt normal but the skirt felt cheap. The heart was also positioned to low so was hidden by skirt
2.0,Very chea . The cuffs say &#34;freedom&#34; by the way! Just not what I thought is all.
2.0,"arrived quickly<br />but very poor quality - after 2 weeks looks like has been worn for a year, with the gold front part rubbing off near completely"
2.0,The shirt is very loose and just doesn‚Äôt have a fitted look at all. The v-neck is very shallow and doesn‚Äôt creat a flattering shape at all. Overall the idea sounded great but the product is definitely not a perfect fit tee
2.0,Looks just like the picture but This product is not stainless steel i wear it twice and the chain is already dark
2.0,This came very small
2.0,"This is a heavy spandexy kind of shirt. Size is true, but i didn‚Äôt like the material at all!"
2.0,Smaller than thought it would be.
2.0,Completely see through. Short. And no give. I got the dark blue. Super cute though
2.0,I'm 40 yrs old 5'2&#34; and 120 and it doesn't really hide any mid-waist imperfections ;) I'm a size 5-6 in all other clothes so ordered the 4-6.  Perhaps the larger size would have fit better. IMO - It'll look great and protect from the sun if you're skinny.
2.0,"I bought this to carry my phone and small wallet around at pools/beach/water parks this summer. There are multiple pockets that will hold small items that do not need to be protected from water (ID, credit cards, chapstick), BUT only one pocket that seals to actually waterproof items. Unfortunately, this pocket was just a fraction of an inch too short to hold my phone (an LG Optimus L90 with a small case. It measures 5 1/4&#34; long).<br /><br />I'm sending this back and getting a waterproof carrier designed specifically for phones."
2.0,Even with valve it is very hard to breathe.
2.0,I was expecting to receive a warm hat and neck warmer but the material felt like a t-shirt. I returned because I thought the material would never be warm enough for the cold winds and winter temperatures I expect.
2.0,"This mask fits well and gives you room to sing, but is made of one layer of thin fabric, which I don't think is very protective against COVID"
2.0,"The headband itself is nice. However, the one I received is very pink. Not mauve at all."
2.0,"The pattern and imagery on this ""ugly"" christmas sweater is great. Too bad the neck opening is way too large. I ordered a Medium. I'm a Medium in everything. The neck opening is way too large and the sleeves are much too tight at the forearms. It's just a very unusual or sloppy cut. Everything else fits as expected. The material is kind of cheap but what do you expect for $23.  You would expect the sweater to at least be cut to the proper dimensions -- that doesn't cost anything."
2.0,"I like the colors just not the grammar.  I thought it said ""Worn by Force"", but it says ""Wore by Force"". Not exactly what I wanted but it'll do."
2.0,Zipper broke!
2.0,CHAIN BROKE DAY ONE.
2.0,"This wristwatch is extremely loud. I thought there was a bug buzzing around in my car when I first got it. And I can hear it across the kitchen at night, even with two ACs running blowing in rooms nearby.. I hid it in the breadbox under some papers. Besides the noise issue, the watch is an inexpensive option for work and is not too big or gaudy."
2.0,"Product is flimsy, and the bag packaging didn‚Äôt protect it at all. It came crushed and deformed. I thought it would be made out of sturdier material"
2.0,Exceptionally large. Covers my entire butt exactly if that‚Äôs what you want. I‚Äôd go a size smaller though
2.0,"If you wear orthotics in your shoes, you'll need them in these, too. I was hoping to get a pair of around the house shoes with a built in orthotic, like vionic, but these do not. The arch is a good high arch, but too soft to provide support.  One of the sole inserts has a stiff bottom, which helps, but the soft arch still collapses.<br /><br />If they didn't play up the plantar fasciaitis angle, I'd give these 5-stars, and if you don't need orthotics, but sometimes your arches seem ""tired,"" these may be worth a try."
2.0,"Nice idea but Boy Oh Boy what a poor item. My primary reason for purchasing was for the engraving message, its not like the picture where it is so clear its nearly unreadable, strike one. Secondly the lid only hinges 90 degs, so it will easily snap off. Thirdly IT DOES NOT WORK, maybe the battery is flat, strike three. So it is being returned, great looking item in the picture but not so in reality. It is also made of very light weight materials which does not do the  product justice, its such a shame as it could be a fantastic gift."
2.0,"too large to my hubby, and give it to the person with this size."
2.0,Love the colors but too little for my nose
2.0,"These socks are so stinking cute.  My kiddo loved them and wanted to wear them immediately, and they are super soft and seem well made.  However, the most important part of wearing socks is actually wearing the socks... and these are pretty impossible in that regard.  They just don't stay on for more than a few minutes.  Even when sleeping, which is what we mostly wanted them for.  My kids are putting them on their stuffed animals now."
2.0,"This was the best necklace for a month. Then one morning as I was putting it on, it broke. I then tried to tie the two broken pieces together and it broke again. If your looking for something to last, invest in one with a chain."
2.0,"Not true to size, and it fits more like a oversized tshirt than a dress."
2.0,"The material is a thick, shiny polyester with a printed pattern, not dyed so, the reverse is white.  The fit wasn't as baggy as I was expecting."
2.0,"I just received my pendant,the chain that comes with it is, also way to small(children size). the only thing good is the delivery time, it do come on the date that they give you. I would have known before hand the actual size of the pendant."
2.0,We ordered a size up because others said they run small... But we got some small pants.. They look like they are made for girls..not teens or women. My daughter cant get them up.
2.0,"I like Viv but this pair arrived and the waits band was not really elastic. The elastic is in the band, but seen so tight that there was no give. This is my 3rd pair of these pants because I typically love the fit but these probably caused bruises trying to pull over my thighs.  Once we past the largest part of my thighs they fit great, but something is wrong with this pair."
2.0,Top rolled down.
2.0,Cute fuzzy slippers but run WAY too small. Had to return.
2.0,I have wanted one of these for years and it fits loose and if adjusted to much with the clasp it seems it would break I haven't gotten brave to even try lol
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and when I put this on the pants came up to below my knees, the fabric is thin, and faded. Also they are huge parachutes on the bottom"
2.0,"I wanted to like this sleepwear set. The material is super soft and nice color. However, the crotch of the pants was super long, elastic at the waist was uncomfortable, and ultimately it was very unflattering. It was returned."
2.0,uncomfortable and too small for the size
2.0,Everything about the band seemed just like the original when it first arrived. However I've had it for almost 3 months and one side refuses to snap into place. It comes undone constantly. The other side popped up a little from the rubber and i can't get it back in. Even my guy friends have tried and same result. I've been walking around with it in my pocket and asking different friends to have a try at getting the strap to stay. Now I'm going to have to buy another.
2.0,It's definitely very aesthetically pleasing but it's very cheaply made if you're going to wear it take it off in the shower or in physical activity it's cute but it did not stand the test of time from the time I bought it it only lasted a month but very cute would not buy again!
2.0,"Disappointing‚Ä¶kukui nuts look like they‚Äôre painted brown and the ‚Äúshells‚Äù look like lacquered unpopped popcorn. I should have returned it. Now, sitting in a drawer. Quick shipping though‚Ä¶ppfftt"
2.0,"For me it did not work.  I got a BIG copper taste in my mouth, which proved it was ""working"" but did not help me."
2.0,"Disappointed that these goggles are very uncomfortable. They press on all of the sensitive spots around the eyes. Much smaller than expected. No free returns. If you're looking for comfort, don't waste your money."
2.0,of course this piece wasn't expensive so don't expect to to not break
2.0,"Not as advertised, no logo on hat, no pom pom balls on hat or scarf, not even girly as I thought for me to have paid almost $20 for a set. Wanted it to match my daughter navy blue coat, so disappointed. Only reason I'll keep it is cause it's too cold for daughter to not have a scarf right now, but if management could send me a courtesy cute navy blue one with the unicorn or some type of girly character, I'll be satisfied. Thanks, in advance."
2.0,"I really liked this wallet, but the zipper broke as soon as I started using it."
2.0,They are ok but A LOT smaller than picture
2.0,"The zipper broke, would like to have the company replace it but they don't have them in stock.  This seems to be an ongoing issue with this bag."
2.0,These worked well in my adult shoes but were WAY too big for a child's shoe
2.0,"The reason I did not care for the earrings was the post, there is a ball at the end and when you put in through your ear. It hurt my ears to put the posts in and taking them out was worse."
2.0,Nice fit but too short. I have a short torso and this showed a little skin - not what I was looking for
2.0,You sweat in it like crazy and some of the adhesive is left on your skin
2.0,"Fits well about to the knees and then it narrows to the point that it inhibits walking. I'll probably cut off the bottom or open the side stitches, like the pockets tho"
2.0,It‚Äôs was to much childish
2.0,"Neither the material (really thick) nor the size (huge) was what I expected. The printed logo looks cheaply done, but I didn‚Äôt have high expectations. When I went to return it, they gave me a refund without requiring an actual return, so that‚Äôs something? Through i don‚Äôt know when i may actually wear the thing."
2.0,Wife loved them until she tried to put them on. The clasp part that holds the stem broke off as soon as she opened it.
2.0,"I have a skinny wrist, I did not expect it to be so big, had to give it to my mom"
2.0,Smaller than exspected
2.0,I didn't like that it had a defect in the Leather.
2.0,"After two washes, the fabric doesn't fit well. I would not buy again."
2.0,I ordered two sizes to big and it fit like a size to small. So keep that in mind when ordering. I usually wear a L or xl and I ordered a 2x and it‚Äôs fitting like a M
2.0,"I love the look and design HOWEVER, and this is most important - it doesn't track the steps very well at all. Which makes me feel like it was a waste of money."
2.0,Not at all like the picture. The colors are too much for me and makes it look cheap. The colors are nothing like the dress I received.
2.0,Bracelet not tight enough to stay in place...slides down.
2.0,Returned as the quality seemed very poor and they looked cheap.
2.0,Nice earrings but very heavy.  Also they would not fit  the holes in my ear.  way too large.  I had to return them.
2.0,This is a really fun Christmas onesie for the kids. Unfortunately the product I received is not what is pictured. This picture says &#34;The Grinch&#34;. This is what I wanted and actually why I bought from this seller. Other sellers say &#34;You're the Mean One Mr. Grinch&#34;. I didn't want this for my 11 year old daughter. This is what I received though. May not be a big deal for some but it was for me and my daughter. Seller needs to picture the exact product they ship.
2.0,Top not taylored. No cuffs on the sleeve. Would NOT buy again.
2.0,"Right off the bat it had a very weird smell. The texture felt very heavy and almost waxy. It fit pretty true to size. When I washed it, it took some of the waxiness away but after washing and rewashing It hasn‚Äôt changed."
2.0,I am stuck with four shirts that we will never use because I missed the return window. Poor quality and fit.
2.0,Neckline didn't show the sparkle underneath. The straps are too long for the sparkle under shots part. It is bit wide.
2.0,The dress was very beautiful but i had to refund it back due to size. Buttons kept coming a loose because its not big breast friendly
2.0,"Its a cute dress and all but it runs a bit small and the skirt part is way cheap material, but i do like it, she'll get atleast two wears in this dress till it stops fitting so definitely size up mommas"
2.0,"the top fits weird and the left sleeve was poorly sewn that it broke off from the shirt. The material is definetely cheap, like thin plastic"
2.0,"it fit well, but LEAKS!"
2.0,"It wrinkled up, and now littles like a little pink diaper."
2.0,"I wasn't very pleased with this sweatshirt,it was stated anti pill but it is terrible I've tried everything for it not to pill but with no success,too bad to because I love the color"
2.0,"Runs large, fabric is flimsy and the V is too low cut. Returned."
2.0,"The good: the design is pretty, as are the colors. The fabric is soft. The stitching seems ok.<br />The bad: The pants crotch is halfway down the thigh. If the crotch is pulled up to where it should be, the waist goes to the nipples and the legs turn into capris. Super awkward cut. Maybe good for toddlers in large diapers but otherwise terrible fit and on the short side. The photo shows the size 6 pants on my 20th percentile height 5 yr old girl. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2.0,"Right shoe didn't light up and they had to be returned. Very disapppointing for my daughter who waited more than a month for their arrival. Return was easy, but still a disappointing gift."
2.0,The bracelet didn't was too small for my daughter's wrist. It looked sorta cheap too.  I thought the picture looked better than the bracelet. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Someone else might really like it.
2.0,Very sheer. Awkward straps.
2.0,"Its too short. its really upsetting, i cant even wear it. The desgin is super cute."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt find it to look very appealing on. Perhaps someone with a very long thin neck would be able to pull it off better.
2.0,"Jersey is double-layered. Definitely not going to be comfortable on hot days. And I'm a skinny cyclist with little Tyrannosaurus arms, and the sleeves felt uncomfortably tight after just 3 minutes wearing in the house. I can't imagine how annoying that would get after 60 minutes on the bike. Unfortunately going to have to return it.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Edited to add: Excellent customer service, so added a star to update from one to two. After I posted my review the seller contacted me offering to send a new jersey with the elastic removed from the sleeve. Appreciate the offer, but an elastic-less sleeve will probably flap and cause drag; and the double-layer jersey will still be too thick/hot on summer days."
2.0,Returned‚Ä¶ This is an amazingly thin fabric that will never retain any shape.  The logo looked nice though..
2.0,"I liked the look of this top, that‚Äôs why I ordered it. But the material was not what I expected. It was white on the inside and the buttons did not go all the way to my pants. I tried to tuck it in but it kept coming out of my pants. The sleeves were not as long as what the picture showed."
2.0,"Zipper does not work well at all, from day one.  After a little time it just doesn't work.  Disappointed.  I would love it if the zipper worked."
2.0,These panties are high waisted but they run small and are not the ones pictured in the ad photo. They do not have the breathable mesh in the front. The panties also are very tight around the thighs. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.¬†¬†I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.
2.0,"Sleeves are incredibly shorter than the photo. In the photo it looks long full length sleeves, but it was half length, big difference. there are some ravels from rough sewing."
2.0,Granddaughter wears a 2T and these 2T were to small
2.0,"I'm 5'-8"" and dress drages on ground. Super thin material. Pretty print"
2.0,Its not the quality as i expected and the tag qas stitched outside..  the green shade was lighter and faded green.
2.0,"Cutter & Buck is usually my &#34;go-to&#34; shirt. The color choices were good but what I really liked was the breathability. Most polos that are breathable are usually paper thin or made of polyester that starts sticking to things via static electricity. This shirt is plenty thick but breaths well in warm/hot weather.  It's also seems very durable.<br /><br />The shirt runs big and I after purchasing a large, I had to return it for a medium.  Also, it's not a very soft shirt making it a bit uncomfortable in the collar.  The price was good, but based on the fabric softness alone I would not purchase this shirt again."
2.0,"Material is super scratchy, see through and overall cheap. It looked so cute on but I am returning it for that reason."
2.0,"Decent fit for the price. No real vents, and prone to fogging. Aviator lens especially. Got what I paid for, I guess."
2.0,I generally wear an XL or a 2Xl in my shirts and jackets / coats.  I ordered the 2XL version of this coat and it fit smaller than a similar large jacket I gave to Goodwill!  I hope the seller can rectify this issue for me.
2.0,The overall fit was not what I was expecting
2.0,"I wasn't a fan of the size. It was every deceiving because the inside of the purse was much smaller than the outside.  I should have listened to the other reviewers, but I thought I would take a chance."
2.0,"This is a bad shirt. I chose it because I liked the low-key pattern that wasn't too cowboyish, but I should have been more discriminating. For example, if I'd looked more carefully at the product photo I might have  noticed that the shirt lacks a pocket. What kind of button up shirt doesn't have a pocket? Plus, the flannel is weird - kind of stiff and cardboard-y, perhaps because the laundering instructions say YOU SHOULDN'T PUT IT IN THE DRYER. Wtf. It's a flannel shirt, for crying out loud, not a tuxedo... Anyway, it's a pretty crappy shirt. You can do better."
2.0,Size in description was way off.
2.0,"Two stars because it‚Äôs super cute, but also two stars because it‚Äôs extremely tiny! I‚Äôm not talking about shape and style, I ordered a large for top purposes and it could have fit a child ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2.0,Not what I expected and doesn't feel like a compression sock.
2.0,I am a 105lb girl with size 36D chest I ordered the XL.  It‚Äôs  almost impossible to get this sports bra on and when on its way too tight.  Back straps rub on shoulder blades it‚Äôs just very uncomfortable for something that‚Äôs supposed to be comfy.  These sizes are way off.  Do not order this unless you are flat chested because they do t make triple XL.
2.0,Broke out in a rash after this item came in contact with my skin
2.0,"These 2XL slippers were supposed to fit a Man's size 14.  I couldn't;t even begin to put them on, they were so small.  Fortunately, my wife thought they were cute and fit  her OK - she's a Woman's size 9.  So Buyer Beware on the size quoted!"
2.0,Super adorable and my daughter loved them. Until they literally started coming apart at the seams in the toe of both shoes . . . 5 days after the return window closed.  Two stars only because they were cute.
2.0,I bought a medium and I‚Äôm 145lb. This fits extremely large. I choose this size based on the size chart in the discription.  I need to get it adjusted to fit me. The positive side is the material is thick but it‚Äôs short and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù. I will need to wear legging.
2.0,Sizing is off.  Too large in the cups and the band it weird.  The material is NOT like the &#34;SA&#34; brand.
2.0,"Face mask works very good for my husband but for me it does not. It does not stay on my nose it, it constantly slides down to my chin, therefore leaving me unprotected."
2.0,I ordered this item 2 times. Two times I got the wrong product! The picture clearly shows dinosaurs. I keep getting supernatural. Why?
2.0,"I am 5'10 and this dress looks like a tween's jumper dress.  Nothing at all like the picture online.  So disappointing.  The color is pretty but again nothing like the picture on the website.  Nor does it look like the other pictures that were posted by women who purchased the same dress, just a different color."
2.0,Made for young bodies not older men
2.0,"I loved the way this band looked, however it constantly became unattached from the Fitbit causing it to fall off my arm.  The final time it fell to the floor and the clasp broke off the band. I won't buy another one of these."
2.0,"The leotard arrived and fit as expected.  Unfortunately within 6 months, the stitching along the entire front neckline came undone.  Now elastic is exposed, it's uncomfortable, and looks terrible."
2.0,"I saw an email from Amazon advertising their ""made-to-measure customizable"" tshirt and I was curious so I clicked.<br />Then, their cool little app did a ""body scan"" and I was like ""OK, I have to try this"".<br />I'm a pretty small guy - 5' 7'' and 135, so I'm always trying to find a good ""smedium"" tshirt. Smalls are too small and mediums kind of swallow me. So I thought this might be the perfect option.<br /><br />So yesterday, my t-shirt arrived and I eagerly threw it on... and was immediately pretty disappointed.<br />It's pretty blousy - at least as big as any medium I have. But somehow, even worse. The sleeves are extremely big (around) and the shoulder seams come down way past my shoulders.<br /><br />In other words, I would give this shirt a B- if it were a size smaller.<br /><br />But I definitely wouldn't pay $30 for another one."
2.0,I like it but it definitively needs ironing after every single wash.
2.0,Is the smaller tee i bought. If u used to buy sx buy it small. Im Disappointed.
2.0,"I didn't rate the comfort of these socks for my husband because they were way too small to get on him, but they seem like they will be very comfy once I return them for the right one. The quality is excellent and they're very well priced! My husband wears a size 11 1/2 shoe so I bought the L/XL because that's not a really big foot for most guys, so I figured these would be ok...not. I think the 2 XL is what he needs and will return the ones I bought for that larger size. I'm not sure why there is no size guide available...kinda weird! Or why there's not at least more information about how they fit because reading through the reviews and questions wasn't much help...also kinda weird. I mean, how hard is it to include a shoe/size guide for these socks??? I think not very."
2.0,"The socks are comfy and warm, but after just one wash the decorative stitching along the bottom came loose and the tread started separating from the sock."
2.0,These are large socks. They don't appear to have small sizes.
2.0,"Not real compression pants, more like leg thermals. Worked great at keeping me warm on a recent trip to the mountains."
2.0,They are all the same size and same looking
2.0,Don‚Äôt get it wet.  Varnish come right off
2.0,"I thought the blue strap would be large enough to go around your wrist but it is so small you can only put 1-2 fingers through.<br /><br />I seen a lot of people saying it broke, but it hasn‚Äôt for me so far. I also only have 3 regular keys and a car key (with buttons). So we will see."
2.0,"I know for the price I really shouldn't talk about quality, but I do expect for there to be no defects and there were.  This product has chains, and 2 of the chains were hanging longer than the rest of it.  Not a lot of money, but the shape it was in I couldn't use it so I consider that throwing money away, which I try not to.  I don't recommend this one."
2.0,"The material is very thin and holds wrinkles. In addition, the legs of the built in panty are too loose to securely hold a tennis ball."
2.0,"I am 5'3, 120lbs, and ordered a small. It was way too tight in the waist and several inches too long. However, the color was gorgeous."
2.0,Chain is worthless cheap. Pendent looks good but also cheap hollow no weight to it. Get what you pay for left more of a reveiw on same braclet . same quality junk. see other review .
2.0,After great reviews I bought it.<br />It‚Äôs too big on my wrist
2.0,Fell apart after two months.
2.0,"Unhappy, this was for our youngest son, had to put three patches on it for his school and now one off the snaps/buttons has pulled through the fabric.<br />Unacceptable. Do not purchase this jacket."
2.0,"Product description reads ""Package Included: 1 X Blouse"" which I took to mean size 1x. This top is a small.  Oops!"
2.0,"Such a cute print, but not chiffon, cheap fake pearl buttons, disappointed. ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è"
2.0,"S√∫per bellas todo, bien empacadas, traen un case que es una bolsita con la marca guess pero le doy dos estrellas porque vienen demasiado grandes yo hab√≠a visto un comentario y me dije quiz√°s sella tiene cara fina y le quedan grande y quiz√°s a mi no pero es que las gafas vienen demasiado grandes se caen cuando bajas la cabeza y es frustrante que est√°n tan bellas buena calidad bien empacando sin rayones y queden tan grandes. Busquen videos en YouTube de c√≥mo ajustar lentes y les va funcionar yo lo hice y ya me quedan s√∫per ajustadas."
2.0,It's a 10 dollar belt.
2.0,"I got these because I like the style of wearing rectangular frame black glasses, but I don‚Äôt have any need for prescription glasses. These ended up just being much bigger and more goofy looking than is advertised. They just look weird. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to wear these casually.  The only realistic application for maybe wanting to wear these, that I can imagine, is for a costume where you are pretending to be a nerd."
2.0,Proportions off
2.0,I went by the picture and thought it came with all 5 and you just picked size and color. I was mistaken. It only came with one earring. Earring was good but you can get a lot more for the same price.
2.0,"My vest arrived in a timely manner, but upon inspection I found a hole right in the center of the back. Be aware that the front edge of the vest is not a finished hem, only serged. The fabric is very thin, thinner than a t-shirt.  I expected better quality for the price."
2.0,I ordered a size up and for feast. But the zipper broke the first time. Sending back
2.0,They are cheap shorts. Material and weight are kind of cheap. Thin nothing that I would wear to go out in. I would use them as maybe cleaning shorts so I returned.
2.0,"After 10 months of use, the 'mode' button just fell out, rendering watch useless since that button is used for time setting too.<br />It's a shame companies ruin an otherwise good product with such sloppy/cheap failings.<br />It's actually has some nice design features, other than the fact that it runs slow (maybe 20-25 seconds every 6 months or so), but I could live with that. But buttons falling out? No excuses for that. I'm not the only one either, according to other reviews."
2.0,"Came apart easily and cracked. Overall not a bad buy, just not very sturdy."
2.0,"Although these were on clearance and cost hardly anything, the zipper will not open so that I can try them on."
2.0,"Dress is see through.  Because of the material, the pockets are useless for anything more than your hands or a lip balm.  It is a reasonable &#34;wear around the house&#34; dress, but not what I wanted"
2.0,Made cheaply and small
2.0,While the hoodi fits well the material that it is made of is absolutely garbage.
2.0,A bunch broke my first time wearing them. They're cheap so I didn't expect anything else but still sucks.
2.0,I got a small and it was still a little large in the bottoms and the top not too bad but still.  The bottoms were a very think cheapy material and the top straps that wrap around are much thicker than shown in the pictures I was very disappointed because it looked so cute but it isn‚Äôt what it looks like in real life
2.0,band rolls up
2.0,these are okay but they tore at the seams after a while.
2.0,I wear a L in US clothes.<br />I ordered an XXL.  Not even close to my size.  Fits like a compression shirt.<br />Wish non US manufacturers would provide a conversion chart.  The numbers provided on the page are off.
2.0,Fabric thinner and too clingy for my liking
2.0,"Bought this for use with a single Nikon D3400 camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Quick release clips<br />- Wrist strap has comfortable material<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cannot easily switch hand strap with shoulder strap, connectors are different sizes<br />- Pattern is a floral pattern, was hoping for just plain black<br />- Long Straps can easily slip out and don't have much support (don't use with heavy camera)<br />- Not easy to quickly take shots when using shoulder strap<br />- Camera sticks out from waist when using shoulder strap so it can easily get bumped when walking around<br />- Almost impossible to put short strap on camera, then impossible to remove once it's on"
2.0,Fabric was so heavy this could never be worn in the summer. Very tight around hips.
2.0,"First I must say that I purchased the 3mm size for myself. These little earrings are the perfect size for me. My hair is shoulder length and curly and I practice yoga daily so I needed earrings that I could wear during practice that would not pull, tug or otherwise interfere with my yoga. These are perfect. They're very lightweight to the point of which I have worn these to bed with no problems. They are small but no so small that you cannot see them. Most likely I'd say that if you have multiple ear piercings, then this size would be good for you. So far, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Edit: these earrings have already tarnished! Not that I expected much from a cheap pair of earrings, but buyer beware that you'll probably not have these for long!"
2.0,Really nice dress but be absolutely sure you want it cause they give the runaround on the return. The dress didn't fit and they approved the return then didn't want to take it back. They offered me $35 to keep it and never sent the $35.
2.0,The gloves I love but the hat is so small. Plus it looks like an old fabric football helmet. ü§£
2.0,Even though the outside part of sock did not slip it did inside the sock.
2.0,The the snaps that hold the buckle on do not stay snapped. Cheap Mexican import.
2.0,"I ordered a small based on other reviews. I am 5 feet tall, 126 pounds, 34DDD. The bottoms fit perfectly, but the top was HUGE. Even after tying it as tightly as possible, it didn't even come close to fitting.  Returned."
2.0,"the delivery was within the expected time, but the quality of the product is not very good! ties are not cedeüëé"
2.0,I love the sunglasses but I wish it had information about sizing. As they are a little bit small on me.
2.0,Did not fit as expected.  Much smaller than expected.
2.0,Got it as a gift and it ripped after two weeks &#62;:/
2.0,Very cute but top and bottoms do NOT coordinate in size. I am 5‚Äô and 115lbs. She shorts fit fine but the top is WAAAAAAAY to small.
2.0,"Very cute and denim is soft but there‚Äôs no stretch at all. You will definitely have to go up 2 maybe 3 sizes depending on if you have curves or not. I read other reviews and went up one size (M-&#62;L) and it was way too small. I may order again just because it‚Äôs such a cute date night, dress up but casual kind of outfit. And also because I just love a cute jumper. But I‚Äôm not sure."
2.0,"I bought these for my daughter, she is still crawling but walks around a lot while holding on to furniture. At first glance, I really liked these shoes. They seamed to be of good quality, my daughter likes wearing them and they slip on nicely with the elastic shoe strings.<br />However, with that being said, not even a week into wearing them and they are already getting worn down. The toes of the shoe are pealing off from her crawling, considering this is a toddler shoe I thought they would have been more durrable and would have lasted a few months, but that's not the case."
2.0,I actually liked the shoe but after my daughter walked around for about 5 mins two of the Pom poms popped off :(
2.0,"I got the red floral in a large- I am 5'3"", 170 lbs, 36DD, and thought this was more of a maroon color from the photo, but it is very much a red. The dress got returned because it was cotton and not a nicer fabric and was too red for the party I needed it for. It also came about high knee/mid thigh on me which I wasn't a fan of. The chest was a bit tight too."
2.0,chain broke after a week. Wife is very gently and it still just broke.
2.0,They‚Äôre reallly pretty but the post broke when I was putting the back on it.
2.0,"These are comfortable for an adult, but on the tight side.  The problem is I ordered these because they are OTG (over the glasses).  Maybe if you have a tiny pair of reading glasses they'll work, but they don't for an average pair of eyeglasses.  And this is two different adults trying them with their eyeglasses.  Not bad quality for the price, but I can't use them with either pair of eyeglasses I have.  I'll give them to my grandkids."
2.0,"Not for Mr body type, love the color"
2.0,"Didn't love the fit, pretty cheaply made which is I guess what you would expect."
2.0,Great looking shoe... except one was sewn larger than the other. Too much 'give in the rope.
2.0,I‚Äôve worn them for maybe a week and they have either disappeared from my crocs completely or the center gems have fallen out of their settings. Very disappointing.  ü•≤
2.0,The larger pearl weighs down the other one
2.0,"Ends are not genuine leather as advertised, but color is cute."
2.0,"I loved the fit and the material, it was super comfortable but this dress in white is completely see through ."
2.0,"Lasted under a year before tearing in two places. Didn't have high expectations, but still a little disappointed."
2.0,"Really loved this necklace at first. But the quality isn‚Äôt as great as I‚Äôd hoped. The color faded very quickly and the charm fell off about 2 months in with no wear and tear (wore it about twice a week). If the quality was better, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars so if you want to wear it just once in a while and don‚Äôt mind tossing it within 6 months, it‚Äôs fine."
2.0,This product some-what resembles bacon but it's a little too red which makes it not look that realistic.
2.0,"It was very awkward to get my Rolex to fit and set into the box, at least for me."
2.0,Huge.  I am 5'9&#34; and a G/H cup bra and I'm swimming In it. Size down.
2.0,"The socks are good fabric, the colors are richer than the ad photo -- but they are not wide calf, and they are not knee height (I'm between 5'7&#34; and 5'8&#34; tall, and my legs are in proportion).  I don't have a 19&#34; calf, more like 17&#34;, and these socks don't come close to fitting.  They are also short.  I like them well enough to wash them to make them shrink even more, and them wear them as mid-calf trouser socks.  But I wanted knee socks that were real socks, not haevy nylon knee=length, and these don't make it."
2.0,"Ok so I'm 210 lb, 5'8, and a 36DD. I ordered a medium based on previous reviews and good god this runs big. The bottom fit fine, but the top was basically falling off! Also the extra fabric at the bottom was so not attractive. Returned!"
2.0,"Lovely belt, but it didn't last. My daughter loved the style of this belt. Liked that it was two sided. But the as you can see in the picture, the buckle broke off. She doesn't wear her belts tight, either. Very disappointed."
2.0,Ordered a large. The top was very tiny and my boobs kept falling out of the bottom of the top. Even if it was tight...just made odd. No elastic around the bottom or anything to keep it snug. I wear 36B. Size 14. Returning
2.0,I wore this to my 15 minutes jogging everyday... it sweat me a lot and I lost weight over 15 lbs  the bad thing is the zipper is not  sturdy and no quality  it's broken already and I have to buy a new one to a different  seller
2.0,"Bzzt... i wanted to like it but it was a very boxy fit.  i had been wearing an Arc'tyrx vest that is cut to fit much much better.  i wanted to like this, im sure that it works well....but for the money it is better to buy something that will fit better and look better than this vest."
2.0,Fabric is somewhat thin for my taste but similar to what I expected based on the pictures. It's a light sweater but thicker than a cardigan. My bigger problem is that the arm holes are low and snug. They land about halfway down my upper arm and felt tight even without sleeves that extend that far under it.
2.0,"Today I went to pack the jacket into the self contained pocket for the second time I have taken it on a backpacking trip.<br /><br />Zipper broke.<br /><br />Far too late to return it, but I am seriously disappointed!"
2.0,"Great material, construction. However - I am 5'1"" tall/118lbs - ordered Medium - a size up, in case. Could not even get all the way on  a foot!  Sad, because I love Merino wool..."
2.0,The waistband is not soft - rather disappointing
2.0,They smell like something from China. They also run small.
2.0,Broke after theee uses
2.0,Pretty dress but the white was way too seethrough.
2.0,legs are too long and arrived with holes in the seems
2.0,"Took far, far too long to receive; these are not as pretty in person as in photos and are very cheap looking; will be ok for childrens costume jewelry."
2.0,"I was hoping I'd still have room in there with a 5X....I mean I could wear it open, and unzipped....but then it defeats the purpose of getting it. I had gotten a yellow mask for it too just for fun"
2.0,Buckle came off in one week! The little kit in hard to put together to repair. Too much work for a belt
2.0,Too small/short for my husband who‚Äôs 6‚Äô2‚Äù
2.0,"The necklace is super beautiful and I love it! ... but... I'm allergic to cheaper metals such as copper and nickel... I'm not allergic to sterling silver, gold, surgical metals... but I reacted to this necklace :(<br />To be fair, I think my neck got the rash only where the clip was... So that would be the only flaw... The necklace is for sure not sterling silver all around if at all... I have sterling silver jewelry that i dont react to at all..."
2.0,Does have a cute vibrant pattern.
2.0,"Cute shirt but the cut on the shoulders makes it look like 90‚Äôs shoulder pads. If you have broad shoulders then this shirts not for you. I usually wear a small to a medium, 34B at 140. I order a medium and it was the right size, shirt is higher than belly button. Sending back due to shoulders."
2.0,I ordered this in small and it's still HUGE on me I'll just keep it and only wear it in the house
2.0,Doesn't fit pandora charms
2.0,Very pretty but cut very small
2.0,"This dress doesn't quite look as depicted. It's very short on my 5'6"" frame. The hem rested just under my buttocks. So bending, dancing, any movement including a deep sigh will cause exposure. It's thin, see-through, not stretchy, but loose material. Also note if you have muscular, or broad shoulders, this may not be the best option.  You can see light being reflected thru the dress, also the hanger I used for display"
2.0,"I bought these neck gators for a mask option due to Covid. They fell off my face, the cute designs I bought them for were big and you couldn't tell what the full graphic was. I tried sewing elastic inside the hem to make them fit. They ended up laying in a dresser drawer."
2.0,please order two sizes up. maybe even 3
2.0,"I thought I was buying a magnetic necklace layerer.  Alas, it‚Äôs not, but still a decent buy."
2.0,The material feels soft and it fits really good but on the back the stitches don‚Äôt lineup with design ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it looks like a student practiced on it so I have to find a way to fix it
2.0,"The shirt‚Äôs armpits smelled like BO when I got the shirt. I know the shirt is short, but it was shorter than I expected based on the picture."
2.0,It‚Äôs ok. The material is very light and the reindeer look funny. Not exactly like the picture.
2.0,"Very thin material, can see thru"
2.0,I have very muscular arms and can't even get my arms in the sleeves.
2.0,Didn‚Äôt fit earrings and tried the different sizes on Amazon
2.0,"While these are not bad looking‚Ä¶ they are extremely flimsy. I am hard on my sunglasses since I spend a lot of time outdoors. They aren‚Äôt just worn for looks but for practicality. So for me, I wouldn‚Äôt buy them‚Ä¶ and I plan on donating them."
2.0,"Got this for my daughter. Looks adorable and she loves it. It‚Äôs more straw colored than the white in the product picture. The first day she wore it, she was sitting in my lap later that night and I caught a whiff of her hair which smelled terrible. I smelled the hat and that‚Äôs where the smell came from. The hat had an old/musty smell. I‚Äôve sprayed it with febreeze and left it sitting in the sun. That cut the smell but not completely. I‚Äôll have to try a few more times or possibly return."
2.0,"Just got the watch.  Is advertised as a mechanical wind up watch and in the description says to wind before each use.  So I start to wind it and dont hear clicking or feeling any tension in the spring.  Out of poops and giggles I opened the back to find a battery and that the crown is only to adjust time and date.  So its not what is advertised.  Now I have to figure out if I want to spend the extra in shipping to return it.  Otherwise for a cheap watch its adequate just not what I wanted.  I wanted an old school wind up because im sick of watch batteries dying then your stuck till you get a new one.<br /><br />Have decided to go through the hassle of returning the watch.  The seller was insinuating I misread the descriptions when it clearly stated to ""wind before each use"".  Im now going with a jaragar watch and highly recommend looking into them.  They have great reviews and are old school wind up watches.  They even make abpoint to say their watched DO NOT run on batteries. There arw even fideos backing up that these are quality old school wind up watches.  Now if my watch stops all I have to do is wind it up and reset the time.  No more making an extra trip to get a watch battery and fighting to get it installed."
2.0,I was quite disappointed with this pendant. Unfortunately it just didn't look like a real aurora borealis crystal and the size was so much bigger than the pictures portrayed. Returning.
2.0,Did not like the frames at all.  Too big.  Clearly more Feminine than the advertising pics.  They are great for woman but not men as stated.
2.0,"The designs are cute and the fabric is soft, but they used the plastic tags to connect both shoulders to the hangers, so snipping 10 little tags off just to get these off the hanger to wash them seems ridiculous."
2.0,"I don't have really big arms, and these were way small for me"
2.0,"Looks like it costs $10, which isn't bad but there is more expensive looking jewelry on Amazon for the same price."
2.0,Looks nice. Took an entire month to arrive and chain broke the second day.
2.0,"I wear a size 12-14 in a dress which prompted me to order the large according to the size chart and the reviews.  I could not even get the two sides of the dress to meet.  I returned it and ordered it again in the XL because it was a lovely fabric and print, and figured I should be able to wear a 16-18 for Pete's sake.  I was wrong.  Still could not close the dress.  Back it  goes."
2.0,Did not fit as advertised. I measured my glasses as suggested and ordered. They work great if you want tl wear them without your prescription glasses
2.0,I couldn't find the information for the width or buckle size.  I would suggest the listing have that information.  I guessed & I was wrong.
2.0,Back chain doesn‚Äôt work properly. Size not accurate. Bought this for present. Didn‚Äôt expected this.
2.0,"Definitely not what I expected, it came with no tag or anything so I don't know how I would send it back. Does I do like the length, and the color was a lot lighter than I thought"
2.0,"The tip of one thumb was cut off!  Wanted these because the thumbs were there.  Material was nice, seemed a little on the small side, but would have been great if the other thumb tip was there."
2.0,Got about 3 days out of these until the gem fell out
2.0,Was smaller and less cuter in person.
2.0,These are not what you think. The underlying spandex isn‚Äôt spandex but just a long liner.
2.0,"i bought these same pants a year ago and they were fantastic for a year, i ordered again and this time they were too long and had a huge hole in the leg. really disappointed."
2.0,They are what they are. Cheap plastic. Kids love them.
2.0,The material is way to thin to wear around anyone.
2.0,The design is only on one side.
2.0,Don't let the photo fool you.  I'm 5-5' and this dress goes 3&#34; below my knee.  Yes below my knee. The material is some what see through.  Colors just as shown though.  May have to think about hemming it up or it's going back.
2.0,I got this in 3XL and if you need to get a hoodie just order from Kingsize. There were loose strings in the sleeve that could have easily undone the stitch by the wrist if I hadn't reacted quickly.
2.0,I have a larger head but I think this is meant for kids. Besides that it is well made and looks nice. It should not be marketed to adults in my opinion.
2.0,"The top is great, and the pants fit fine but after just 1 time wearing the knees are already super faded."
2.0,Very cheap. Made out of plastic.
2.0,Do not look same as pictured
2.0,I don't have a big face and could not get this mask on. It was tiny. The wording was also very small.<br />Unfortunately I  had to throw it away.
2.0,Not happy. Colors are very faded/dull. Fit was large to begin with but then the fabric was easily stretched.
2.0,Youth sized
2.0,One of the 3 immediately fell apart. It was never even worn before it was in pieces. I am disappointed.
2.0,"I love this print and the price can' t be beat.  The problem is that I thought I should order a size or two up, and I really wish I didn't.  I usually wear a xs or s, I ordered a medium.  I am 5'5&#34; at 107 lbs.  If the had a small i would buy another."
2.0,"I don't know who thought a 3x was supposed to be and 1x but no, the colors look pretty but that's about all that matches the description. This is not a v-neck by any means, the material is cheap and my goodness don't get me started on the cut of the arms looking and fitting like it's for a child ,please do better these are supposed to be American sizes not the top fitting like it's for a teenager and the other half and adult."
2.0,"I bought this suit because I love the Retro Look, I went up a size to a XXL because of the reviews but it‚Äôs looser than I expected , I could have gotten a XL and the fit would have been tighter in the buttocks area, but that‚Äôs not the only issue, there are 6 buttons total on this suit, I  always wash my bathing suits before wearing them and immediately a button came off, I went swimming and 2 more buttons came off, another wash and 1 more button came off and the other 2 buttons remaining on the bathing suit were loose and threads were coming out of them! So I decided to sew them all back on and tighten up the 2 that were on it because otherwise I was looking at tiny holes that showed where the buttons belonged! When I started sewing them on I saw that the buttons were only attached to the outer polka dot material, not the inside liner of this suit!, so I had to sew 6 buttons by hand through two layers of material of this bathing suit! Needless to say it took me 1 hour and 15 minutes with arthritis in my hands. I was not Happy with cramped fingers!üò°if you‚Äôre going to design a swim suit with buttons, make sure they are attached properly and not half A$$ed!"
2.0,I am 5 ft. 2 and weigh 115lbs. I usually wear size 8 petite so I bought a small. This nightie fit much too large and the material wasn't as soft as I would have liked.
2.0,"Although very cute, the dress had two large holes when it arrived. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I got them today. They cane packaged well. They are cute however, they are completely see through!!! I am not one to flaunt my junk. I honestly cannot even wear them in the house that see though. Amazon is great at returns & these are going back tomorrow. Sorry, but Not sorry! I gave 2 starts bc, they could be cool, if they could use better material."
2.0,The shirt is too small to be an extra large.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of these, one for myself and my daughter, the zipper sticks on one of them.  It is a beautiful color and I like the inside.  Unfortunate."
2.0,Fabric was cheap...threw away
2.0,"offers minimal warmth. sucked my battery packs dry quicker than I expected. Overall, not thrilled with the item."
2.0,Beware doesn‚Äôt fit all frames.
2.0,"Runs small, definitely juniors fit"
2.0,"These are too short, make your thighs look wider than they are, and the material is stiff and too thick for summer."
2.0,Tiny. I order XL. They were so small I gave them to my friends thin 14yr old daughter.
2.0,I loved it the first night but got it wet the next day and iridescent plastic started to peel off
2.0,"Not as described by the seller! print is in bad quality, and doesn't look as good as the picture. It looks so bad, I cannot give it s gift, as I planned. I would return it but shipping  will cost more. The only reason for 2 stars and not one - it looks like the tote bag itself is pretty good and durable, didn't try it though, just giving it to Goodwill. Don't buy it!!!"
2.0,They didn't look anything like the picture. They was so rose gold.
2.0,Does not look like a picture. Feels like 100% polyester. poor quality.
2.0,Nice but cheap period!!!....
2.0,These are way to small. I couldnt even get then half way up my calf. I normally wear between a 12-14.
2.0,Wayyy too small. I ordered a large (I'm a size 12) and it didn't go over my shoulders. Def buy larger then you normally would.
2.0,Nice but very tiny!
2.0,Planning on fixing it myself but it came broken
2.0,"Fit is a little frumpy, shaped weird, quality isn't that great"
2.0,Tried to rerurn- told by company to keep - cheap looking
2.0,Shirt was too small. Shorts were too but.
2.0,"Not the best undies I‚Äôve had, not super soft and started to fall apart after the 1st wash. They also stretched out and rode up throughout the day."
2.0,Ok until it‚Äôs washed. It shrank. Tended to get baggy the longer you wore it.
2.0,"These felt like little more than knee high socks. My biggest complaint, aside from not providing as much compression as other compression socks that I have used, is that these repeatedly slid down to near my ankles. These did not stay up to the knee which meant that I repeatedly needed to visit the lavatory to pull them up."
2.0,Ball fell off of Key loop within 2 months .. Can't return it .. Poor Construction .. DON'T !!
2.0,"I tried these out in temperatures in the high 30s, and my fingers did not stay warm even at those temperatures.  Also the cuffs are a little short and allowed cold to get to my wrists.  Finally, the outer surface feels like fleece.  Not sure how well it would stand up to heavy use.  I'll be returning them."
2.0,To small for my ear
2.0,I was so excited to find this pattern. Within weeks one strap ripped off. Sewed it back together and now another strap ripped. Not worth purchasing.
2.0,Loved the color but the zippers were very slouchy like the material wasn‚Äôt strong enough to hold them up. I returned them.
2.0,I bought about 8 or 10 of these and paid for expedited shipping just for these to be received broken. It was a waste of time for me to go thru returning because they came from over seas and the price to return them was more than what I paid for. Will not purchase again.
2.0,"I loved the outfit on the model.  I'll be paying closer attention to all pictures in the future.The waist band is not as wide as it appeared on the model and that changed the look completely.  Also, the skirt is a lot more silky than I thought it would be.  It will be going back."
2.0,The blue coating in the lens started to peek and scrape off after a month of use.
2.0,I am extremely hard on boots as I am in grease oil and everything in between. I bought these on December 21st 2021. I am writing this on April 27th 2022. You can see in the pictures all the issues I‚Äôve had with the sole falling off leather on top easily broken. The biggest problem being the soles falling off. I definitely will not buy these specific ones again.
2.0,"*update: tried it again but this time in my personal item for an hour flight, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs in your carry on or check bagged. It will not hold well enough in any bag.<br /><br />So I was really excited for this to arrive! I bought it because I was traveling for a few weeks this year. It definitely should‚Äôve been in my carry on because when I put them in my checked bag it was easily crushed. The form/shape completely wore out and the adhesive around the case did not hold at all! I can still use it for now but it‚Äôs not sturdy anymore and for the price it should‚Äôve lasted a lot longer."
2.0,"This is much longer than it looks on the picture. I am 5'10&#34; and usually that's ok if its longer, but it was even too long for me. It just looks goofy."
2.0,This thing is kids sized ! Disappointing. Luckily I know a 5 year old I'm going to give it to.
2.0,Nice glasses but too wide for me. They poke out near my temples and the lense to ear rails have a slight outward bow in them. They feel solid. But they just don't fit my face shape well.
2.0,Waaaaay to narrow<br />Material cuts into my feet
2.0,I wouldn't buy it again. The thermal sleeves are alright but the gray part with the Lucky logo seems cheap and thin.
2.0,"They weren't what I thought they were.You can see through them which I misunderstood. When the stated hollow I was thinking not solid, not see through."
2.0,Poor decal quality.  Fine for price.
2.0,"When Buying items online, specifically clothing, it can be kind of tricky. For one, it's hard to know if the item fits even though a sizing chart may be provided. I decided to purchase this based upon hope that it would fit. Unfortunately it didn't fit correctly. It was too large, just to be honest. Other than that, it does look nice."
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt really look like the picture. There‚Äôs more gray in the shirt than expected. U have to be standing at the right angle to get the 3D effect. Not really impressed and it runs a little snall
2.0,"I've purchased 4 (red, orange, green, dark blue) colors of this bracelet for 3 of my friends and me. The red color (eligible to Prime shipment) was delivered in 2 days and I loved it. It took a month to get the rest of the order and ... I received them today and they are in very poor quality. The pendant for the remaining three colors is significantly smaller than the red ones, and they have dark markings on them. The quality of the metal is very poor, and I am extremely disappointed. So unless you are planning to buy the colors that are qualified for Prime shipment, stay away from this product!"
2.0,I‚Äôm almost embarrassed to give this to my 7 year old. I was expecting a cotton T-shirt. I don‚Äôt even know what kind of material this is. This short was not worth $22. Just a tad disappointed since today is his birthday and I don‚Äôt have time to return it.
2.0,This bracelet was of very poor quality. It looked more like a $5 bracelet than the $20 I paid for it. A lot of the antiquing was already gone and the pearls were extremely cheap. If the quality were better this would have been a beautiful piece of jewelry.
2.0,I opened up the packaging and got a strong unpleasant odor. This top stunk. After washing it a couple time it was ok.
2.0,"the idea is good, but any astigmatism and these are useless."
2.0,Too cheeky bottoms and size runs large
2.0,"Ok fit, not great"
2.0,Cheap material shirt if you wash it dont put it in the dryer it will shrink. These shirts are super thin and very fragile. I was very dissatisfied with it.
2.0,"The shoes are warm, but I have worn them less than two weeks, and all of the padding in the sole is flat."
2.0,Cute but they all broke
2.0,"Unfortunately this was made for someone much taller than me. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and the whole thing was a good 4-5 in too long (pants, inseam, and top). Otherwise good quality material, well made and comfy. I am a very good seamstress, but couldn‚Äôt fix this one. Returned."
2.0,"Out of the package it has a terrible smell that stays with it after washing. The colour is great, but it‚Äôs not a nice piece. The cut is weird and fits odd."
2.0,This ran a size small so I returned it
2.0,The bottoms fit perfectly but the top is two sizes too small.  The two don't even look like they're the same size.  Disappointed in my purchase
2.0,The size was correct however there is a weird sagging issue with the fit in the front crotch area....I returned because of it.
2.0,"Title is plural, the picture is plural, the description is plural. Received only one. Not bad if you're a pirate."
2.0,Would be great if the shirt was 2X as advertised.  The martial is good $ bottom fits ok.
2.0,These are like spandex....
2.0,"Rings seem of good quality and feel comfortable, however they run a full size smaller. I've measured them twice a size 8 fits like a 7 and a 9 is just slightly smaller than an 8 of metal variety."
2.0,"I bought this directly from PictureOnGold website. The claddagh looks like it was stamped on and not engraved.<br />The front looks polished, but the back does not look polished like the front and looks terrible in my opinion. They charged an arm & a leg to engrave a sentiment inside and a letter on the back.<br />It was a disappointment after spending all that money because I was going to give this as a gift to my niece and now that I see it<br />in person, I've decided not to give it to her. It's a shame because I can't return it since it was personalized.<br />Don't waste your money on this because you will not be impressed and it's not worth giving as a gift."
2.0,"Too saggy, I returned these as they were very unflattering! The material is not very nice, it's like a shiny jersey."
2.0,"Something has changed with the manufacturing of these. I returned a hoop I received last week after recognizing it did not snap tight like my other Sleepers do. I received a new one, put the earring in, noticed that the snap seemed off & I had to keep checking it to see if it was still connected - most of the time it had come unsnapped on its own. Sometime within the 1st 48 hours after receiving it, the hoop fell out & was lost. I have 5 other Sleepers that I bought over a year ago & rarely remove. I've never had a problem with my other Sleepers, but the newer ones don't seem to be the same quality that they used to. Disappointed!"
2.0,Just no. The sleeves make it so awkward.
2.0,"I bought an XS ( jeans size-(25) but these pants were HUGE. Both too long and way too big, these pants aren't exactly well-made. The elasticized waistband of the black and white check doesn't lay right and it's too big too. Very disappointed. Also a discount code listed on  Brad's Deals was for one pattern only."
2.0,"I couldn't wear it, it was so poorly made in the seat was ripped, and white tread pulling loose."
2.0,The feathers fell off everytime it was touched...even lightly.
2.0,"Ok, obviously this was made for a one year old. It was GIANT! Not even close"
2.0,It looked more like a thrift store purchase than a new shirt. The lace neckline was a lot nicer in the pic online. It looked as if it had already been washed.
2.0,"Light weight, pretty, not stretch, doesn't stay in."
2.0,These were very tight and my husband couldn't get them on his swollen feet and ankles.  I sent them back for a refund.
2.0,"The color and material was fine. However, they were pretty wide and large for my baby's feet."
2.0,"Zipper broke after 4th use.  I bought this purse for my daughter since she carries an iPhone and glasses.  It's super cute, but zipper is super flimsy."
2.0,"The swimsuit is really cute in person! Maybe my body is just weird for this cut. Im usually a small, fits like a small. But the bottoms have a bit more coverage then I prefer, and so does the top. I fit in the top but it is almost cut too high because there is no cleavage it just devours my chest, which is usually not an issue for me. I kept it because i got it on sale and might be good for a backup or a trip with family where I have to be more conservative with what I wear."
2.0,It's just OK. I'll keep it to wear around the house. It's actually kind of ugly. I got the apricot one and you can see straight through it. Runs a tad large.
2.0,it looks frumpy
2.0,Cute knee pads but were/are too tight on my 10 month old. Product too small for 18 pounder legs/thighs.
2.0,"Cheap quality, I‚Äôve gotten better swim trunks at Walmart for the same price."
2.0,Runs small. Even after washing this product it is so itchy against your skin. I gave mine away.
2.0,The dress definitely looks as if it came from China.<br />It was a Great company to deal with before I actually placed my order. But once I wanted to return the dress. They were unapproachable!
2.0,Poorly made charms‚Äîlost charms (2) within 2 weeks
2.0,Pants were too small and wouldn't fit despite ordering a size up. Chain that comes with them is flimsy and broke within two hours of wearing. A complete waste of money
2.0,itchy and rips easily
2.0,I am the average shoe size for men ... 10. They advertise this shoe for men. Not true. You have to be a petite woman to get these on your feet. I sent them back and I am through ordering shoes over the internet. Nothing but problems for me.
2.0,"If you have a medium to large chest, this will not fit."
2.0,"The necklace strings are a bit short, so it's almost like a choker on me. It's definitely a cool concept, but it feels a bit light and cheap. Someone else might like it, but I personally don't care for it."
2.0,Not really at all like the photo.. kinda disappointed
2.0,"These are nice comfortable glasses.  They claim to be ""light blocking"", and I assume they are.  But they achieve it by being tinted!  It is a light tint but changes the colors you see.  The photo of the glasses shows them as 100% clear which is not accurate.  I wish I had know that ""blue light blocking"" meant tinted for this brand (unlike other brands).  I returned them."
2.0,"I don't know who thay make XL clothes for, but I'm 180 with a 36"" waist.  Toooooo tight!  :-("
2.0,"Outwardly it‚Äôs very appealing. However, the amount of storage space leaves a lot to be desired. Would recommend purchasing a different product."
2.0,Material is not what I expected even though I did keep it.  Haven't worn yet.
2.0,Very cheap material and there were bleach spots on the shirt upon arrival.
2.0,Had to return these. The fell apart on one west.
2.0,clasp will not stay closed
2.0,"The look of these boots is great, but one try on proved they would crack and wear away almost instantly. I normally stick to Docs, but decided to try something else out. Would not recommend to anyone. I want this style of boot, but I will wait to pay a bit more. These aren't worth it."
2.0,Good fit...itchy even after 3 washings with laundry softener.<br />Had to take off..
2.0,Got a small and was way to big...ugh
2.0,"I loved these socks! They Worked great for flying & 3 days solid of Disneyland<br />I Wore them maybe a total of 9 days in a 2 month period<br />Yesterday the top of compression sock is coming unraveled & is falling down, unfortunately I really need them now as I'm having leg veins catheterized<br />It would of been a 5 except of unraveling top üôÅ"
2.0,This is extremely small. I'm 5'7 and wear a medium  (size 10). I ordered a medium and it appears to be a small....but it was very pretty. I'll reorder this in a XL to see if it fits. I'll keep everyone posted.
2.0,Marks too easily.Never looks nice.
2.0,Super cute dress. I light the style and light weight material but I'm super bummed because I wore it once (haven't even washed it yet) and the top of the dress by the lining has ripped...hence my lower rating. Since it's near the seam I can sew this but it makes me worry about the quality of the material / stitching and ripping again.
2.0,Strange fitting shorts. There‚Äôs a seam that runs horizontally just below the waist that is annoying.
2.0,"Cheap.  The eye is simply a inkjet looking print behind a lens.  They do not have that holographic look at all in person.  Look good from a distance, just don't expect it to look at all realistic in person."
2.0,Looks great clasp is great my dial to set time is broke and watch acted up day after I got it
2.0,The coat looks really nice but the fit was awful. The belted waist is super high and it looked ridiculous. I ended up returning it and getting a Calvin Klein raincoat instead. Similar but the fit is much more flattering.
2.0,These are too sheer to wear. You can see right through them. Cheap.
2.0,No good Quality
2.0,"I liked these glasses at first, but after a very short time, two of the three broke in the exact same place. I haven't worn the other pair, but I feel sure it will break there as well. Very disappointing..."
2.0,Very pretty but too warmüòï
2.0,They‚Äôre awful
2.0,Not what I expected. I'll be returning them. Not large enough and the clips didn't hold.
2.0,Beautiful vest but runs way to small had to give to my daughter
2.0,Not very happy with them one washing and was on delicate cycle and even hung them to dry and they sunken were I can‚Äôt wear them money wasted<br />Can‚Äôt return cause been washed unless your real skinny person I mean real skinny don‚Äôt buy
2.0,"These would be cute, but the clasp on one was broken upon receipt so I couldn't wear.  The earring would not close, and the back part just dangles open."
2.0,"Maybe it depends on color choice,  but i ordered the black. I wear a 2x and this fit like a xl at best, no flaring either. Very disappointed."
2.0,"look nice, but made my ears turn colors."
2.0,"The material of this shirt was VERY restricting. Hard to breath in. I almost tapped out to this shirt alone.<br /><br />After practice, I had to have someone pull it off me. If you get this, order at least 1-2 sizes bigger than normal."
2.0,Broke after 3rd use.
2.0,The Arms are really tight
2.0,"Cute, but very very thin material. Definitely need a slip underneath."
2.0,"I ordered an extra large, they were about a size 8."
2.0,I returned these. They get shorter as you walk.
2.0,"I have never had this happen before - the little bar holding the watchband to the watch fell out after a week.  Luckily, the watch fell off when I was reaching in a bag so I caught it.  I've had many replacement watchbands, but this was the first time that happened.  Unfortunate, because the band itself was really nice."
2.0,"Misleading, most of the earrings are small in size, probably good for kids not for women. I will give most of them to my granddaughter."
2.0,"I asked many questions,,read many reviews,,,all answered by buyers,,,seller never,answered one of many questions,,,I took time to find this,,,it arrived looking  very nice,,,until I took it out if the plastic bag,,,in a package with something else,,,loosely moving around,,,no box?? It as not round,,,only a few places would try to form your wrist,,,it seemed glued in places,,,not pliable at all,,,stones were not matched,,up n down n crooked,,not a straight line,,,these are $19.00 all over Amazon,,,I paid more for better quality n looks,,,I wouldn't pay $5.00 for this cheaply put together bracelet,,,I was very disappointed,,,SELLER did not want to get involved with questions,,,stones falling out,,broken on arrival,,,fading,,,questions I asked,,,but only the Amazon community answered,,,,I should have listened to my gut,,,be very aware,,it looks great,,,til you take it out of the (((  BAG. ))),,,,poor workmanship,,,cheaply slapped together,,,,no customer support,,,just another sale,,,very disappointed,,,I will never buy from this seller again,,,"
2.0,"Really bummed about this. It does not sit snug against the inside of my nose: the hook portion pushes against my septum because it's too long. The metal is either pushing uncomfortably against my septum or the jewel hangs too far out of my nose. It's beautiful and exactly what I was looking for, but the post is just way too long. I guess that's what I get for buying online without actually being able to look at the length in person :("
2.0,"The dress was not want I liked on me after I tried it on.  To long for me as I'm short, but like a below the knee length dress."
2.0,The fabric does not feel like cotton.
2.0,Very tight fit and very short. Ride up and chafe! Cool!
2.0,"This is a very attractive mala for the price, however, it is not made from 8mm beads - they are between 5mm and  6mm and strung on stretch elastic/stretch beading thread which is not the best material when counting prayers on the mala .<br />Service was fast but product was disappointing.  Another case of you get what you pay for."
2.0,"I ordered this same type of clothing from another seller and it was baller, but these are a bit awkwardly fitting. They don't flex quite enough in the hips and the material feels pretty flimsy."
2.0,Super cute if you don‚Äôt like your hat being on tight....
2.0,Disappointed I bought 2x thinking its pretty much a 14-16.  In reality it was a 10-12.  Needles to say either loose the extra pounds or give it to my sister.  I won't buy from this vendor again.
2.0,I wear a size 12 in women's shoes and am 6 ft tall. They fit comfortably in the foot and ankle area but too tight/small to go over my calves.
2.0,"I‚Äôm so disappointed. I did like the band, but after only 3 days of use I decided to switch to another band - which I often do and never had issues with - and the thing simply ripped. The worst is that the broken part was still stuck on my watch and it took me a while to remove it. I was scared the band had ruined my watch.<br />After this experience I will stick to Apple stuff."
2.0,"two of the four were so loose, they fell down on both my kids faces.  the other two had no stretch at all and compressed the face so much, they couldn't be worn.  had to return this item.  my children are aged 9 and 11."
2.0,"Title is misleading; says cashmere but it is only polyester. The scarf was very soft and well packaged, but I wanted a cashmere scarf."
2.0,"The dress is beautiful, but very snug."
2.0,"Beautiful, but I recieved the wrong bracelet."
2.0,NOT kids size. Was hoping to use for daughter's (8 yrs) costume but they fit me and I wear a Men's XL glove.
2.0,"After the first time I washed it on the suggested settings, the ND logo on the chest is damaged... otherwise it's a great sweatshirt.  Nowe it looks &#34;distressed&#34; after oneach wash."
2.0,"The print is beautiful, however, the material and quality of the actual pants are not great."
2.0,Super small and cheap looking
2.0,This necklace came with a missing stone. Can't really wear it now.
2.0,Elegant look but Carrying straos are a bit flimsy.
2.0,"The colors are nice, but the shape is weird. Doesn't fit well on my daughter's face which makes them pretty much useless."
2.0,"It's cute, but not as good as pictures"
2.0,Baggy and needs ironing. A no for me.
2.0,Only had these less than a month before the back pin broke off. I'm disappointed because I really loved how these look. The price still isn't worth only a few wears.
2.0,This gown is pretty but seems a bit skimpy in the sleeves and shoulders. Not comfortable with any movement. Decided to return it for another style.
2.0,Fit great but you can see right through them so I had to return them
2.0,"I was hoping this would look great and be comfortable. And it does... until you start moving. It doesn't stay in place (and it doesn't have to do with the size, it's just the shape of it that's weird). It also took sooo long to get here.<br /><br />Yes, cheap, but definitely not worth it."
2.0,"I got this neckless on a discount.  I wasn't expecting the cross to be as big as it was.  The chain is to skinny and lite weight for such a heavy peace.  It's pretty and all, but it would be better to hang somewhere than to wear because of how heavy it is.  when I took it out of the wrapper, the chain fell off and it was difficult to put back on.  The chain has a really tiny clasp, making it hard to manage."
2.0,The material is nice but it's actually not the bikini the model is wearing in the photo. Upsetting.
2.0,"I really love this set, but I have it now for 2 month and stones are coming off. It really did not look good.... I try to contact the seller, but I could not get a hold of him, otherwise I wish I could exchange it, for a new pair. Maybe the seller is reading this and will get in tough with me."
2.0,j no..
2.0,"It ripped at the shoulder seam just from putting my arm through the sleeve.  The stitching is flimsy and the material is so thin that if you wear the white one, you cannot get away with only wearing a bra underneath.  I won't purchase this again. I had to throw it out."
2.0,"Showed up super small.. I'm a size 8/10 so I got what was suggested for a size 10. I would suggest maybe going two or three sizes up next time. I'm not very wide so it fits fine in that way but it's so short that it fits like a halter-top almost.<br /><br />Would not suggest for anyone over 5'7&#34; unless you're getting a super large size and maybe that would be ideal for more heavyset girls?<br /><br />A shame, this thing looked super cute in the photos."
2.0,Very flimsy.  My glasses broke in a week.  Maybe it is a good buy for the price and you get what you paid for.  I would never buy this again.
2.0,Lovely green color. Sleeves longer than expected and overall a little short.  Barely comes to my waist.
2.0,"These are not really carbon fiber, but some type of molded plastic. The blue color infused in the plastic makes them look a bit like bicycle reflectors rather than real carbon. The mechanical bits look OK, so they would probably be fine for use to hold your cuffs and shirt together, if you like the look. Not for me, though. Sending them back."
2.0,"Very thin, not comfortable, Not made for the Northeast states cold nights..."
2.0,"Love the material and the softness and oh so comfy, I thought I finally found my comfort zone for the night. Until I washed it once and it shrank so bad. I‚Äôm so disappointed"
2.0,Cheap quality and the one size is too small. More appropriate for a child or a petite teenager no taller than 5‚Äô1. I returned this product
2.0,"no complaint about the size - they said it's small, and it is. size is just what they describe. since i wanted a small or mini crossbody, it's perfect for me. i can fit my phablet, keys, lipstick, freebie little change purse (nice, thick felt with a snap closure, very cute), and my credit cards. it's the quality i have issues with. the chain on the side is rusty and has left rust marks on the white cotton. the stripes are horizontal, NOT vertical that way i ordered and wanted. the &#34;drawstring&#34; is actually a 1/4&#34; wide piece of vinyl that won't keep the top closed. for a child or young girl, this is probably fine. it didn't cost very much, but still too much to return it. disappointed in all the great reviews. led me to buy a bag that's not worth half the price. part of the reason i bought this one is that if the stripes were vertical, it would have nicely matched a blue & white striped beach bag i have."
2.0,"The wallet is nice; however, I am returning it for two reasons. First, the logo plate on the back if the wallet is upside down compared to the photos online. Second, the wallet didn't function well for me and all the things I need to put in my wallet."
2.0,Shipping was very slow.  Bought for granddaughter.  It was way too small.
2.0,"The color is so nice. I do not care for the stretchy fabric on the side it seems to wear out too fast. I washed it and the zipper got weird, and the side material got all kinds of bebes. Not easy to get off."
2.0,Material is hard to breath thru. Cotton is better.
2.0,the glitter started falling off the first week
2.0,It's a little big but there is no support at all. The fabric is very thin. Just didn't work for me.
2.0,"The flower is cute. The color very pretty.  Solidly made.  Can't read the Ohana Blessing to save my life. The words are soooooo tiny and shiny, they are nearly impossible to read."
2.0,Gold coating wears off after a while. Not durable enough to wear in water.
2.0,"These socks were nice however the sizing was completely off. I needed an extra large I. These socks since I have to wrap my feet daily and I could barely get these on my foot, let alone they were not what I expected. If you are just looking for. Warm sock this is it but if you are looking for a large sock that stretches easily I would get posey."
2.0,"My granddaughter got hers for Christmas, so poorly made, they were broken in 5 minutes from her just trying to put on her face. Not for toddlers..maybe 5 or older."
2.0,"This product arrived promptly, and was packaged nicely with an attractive case and two lens cloths.  The glasses themselves, however seem fairly flimsy and not very durable.  The lenses are only weakly polarized, when tested against another pair of polarized sunglasses (by rotating them while looking through both pairs).  The main visual effect is to turn everything yellow but glare reduction is minimal if any.  They are more effective against those blue ""point-source"" type headlights, however., they are totally ineffective against high beams."
2.0,"Material is not how it appears online. More of a ribbed lightweight shirt,  not a sweater"
2.0,"If you're busty and it fits, it will not be a good time. I was hunched over, it pulled me into a turtle shell, shoulders hunched, etc. I am busty, it was a mistake. If you're not overly well endowed you may like this?"
2.0,Extremely plain and overpriced.  Not recommended.
2.0,"The silver faded to bronze quickly which made it look discolored , but I loved the wristlet part of it."
2.0,"I couldn‚Äôt give a good review on this product! However I will give credit to delivery and softness as well as the weight of the fabric! This is a gift and I don‚Äôt know how it will fit but I‚Äôm sure it will be fine but while unpacking the item to wrap for Christmas and inspect, I noticed a stain on the right  front chest area! I‚Äôve enclosed a picture! Not sure I will give it as a gift now!"
2.0,Runs really small. I‚Äôm a medium at best and an ex large barley fits
2.0,"Not only did i have to rip the entire packaging box open to use the gloves, thanks to someone bright idea of putting all the gloves inside a plastic bag and then inside the packaging. They are SUPER loose and thin for being medium. Overall, not happy."
2.0,"As stated by another reviewer (which I didn't see posted until after my purchase) I ordered up a size (or two) because I wanted it to be baggy not fitted. I ordered and XL and it is huge on me. I normally wear a Med/Large. I would say order typical size. Quality of material is nice and it is a thicker cotton and well made.  I Purchased on January 10th, received Feb 5th which is apparently just past the return deadline (convenient, huh?). While I had intended to wear it during the day it is now a sleep shirt."
2.0,Fabric is super cheesy and flimsy. Tummy control works only if you don't have a tummy. I do like the side pocket for my phone.
2.0,"These are comfortable, however, I bought them in March and they are coming apart at the seam in the butt area. They do not fit tight on me so there was no strain on them."
2.0,I loooooved it as a whole. But it was not long or flowy like the picture. It was skin tight. I ordered a 3x so it would be a little loose.  The bottoms for like a large (gave to my boss).  So just make sure you order larger then what you need.  Then maybe it will look like the pic.
2.0,"I just wanted a floaty dress. I love the pattern on this one. But when it arrived, it's too tight in the upper arms, it flattens my chest out and it is tight around my lower hips. I am a curvy girl, but I read the reviews, especially from someone around my size, and while I can button this up, it does nothing for my chest area. I do kinda like to leave it unbuttoned, and just tied shut, over shorts and a tank top. I really liked the pattern too, so I'm very disappointed."
2.0,"Was hoping this could be a replacement for an old, well-worn hat I got from a department store many years ago. Unfortunately the cap part is far too shallow to pull the hat down as far as it needs to go in order to stay securely on. I do have a somewhat larger head, and often find this problem with hats. However, I suspect some of the people saying it is &#34;too big&#34; are actually having the same problem. The hat does not go down far enough on the head to feel secure, thus making it susceptible to blowing off, especially since it has such a rigid wide brim.<br /><br />This problem is alleviated by zipping the hat part off and wearing it as a visor only, since you can then tighten it and pull it down as far as you want. However, I was hoping for the hat utility as well."
2.0,These are basically jeggings (jean leggings) for men hahahaha. Material feels mostly like spandex.
2.0,The color is sort of deceiving. This product is bright orange! Also it is extremely large. I ordered a small when usually a medium and it was way too large and didn‚Äôt lay like it does on the model.
2.0,Too small for size one little boy foot even though they were advertised for size 1-2
2.0,To small for my guy but very soft and nicely made.  I could have used a 2X.  I returned.
2.0,My Jesus piece clasp broke in two three days and I only wore it once
2.0,Ordered Pink and I received Fuchsia.
2.0,"Was expecting more from this dress. Unfortunately it is super short and super low in front. May be could be used as a cover up, but I wouldn't feel comfortable even bending over for something when wearing this."
2.0,The fit was perfect it was comfortable just the craftsmanship wasn't there ended up buying two pairs after this and both of them have been falling apart at the pocket
2.0,This product smelt really bad and felt kind of cheap
2.0,This product if fine I just have lower reviews because the tassel colors are not anything like what is pictured. And the fabric is a see through I thought it wasn‚Äôt going to be. I ordered two and both have the same tassel coloration than what I expected it to be.
2.0,"These are not 1/2"" pipe thread....."
2.0,It's a nice watch but I could not read the face- I think the white background was difficult too.<br />I need reading glasses and need a BIG watch- this unfortunately did not work for me<br />but it is a nice looking watch.
2.0,"so disappointed! In a really nice box, looks nice., then you pick it up..its really cheap feeling metal and the clasp is silver colored PLASTIC! was afraid to pull to hard on clasp for fear it would snap in my hand...for what I paid...very upsetting...needless to say..its going back."
2.0,Cheapest material and stitching I've ever seen.
2.0,"My wife likes this color and the actual design she says is flattering to her. She is 5'3"" and ~130lbs and typically wears a Medium and/or a size 6/8. Fitment is accurate in her opinion.<br /><br />She states she would give 2 stars overall:<br />1. Material is a little scratchy and thin, you'll need a slip or spandex<br />2. She does NOT like the seam placement at all<br />2a. There is a seam directly in the middle of the dress (please see the pictures I uploaded, and sorry if they are rotated, I have no idea why they are rotated)<br />2b. There is a seam exactly in the middle of each boob area, she states that is poorly placed<br /><br />If it didn't have the non-ideal seam placement and if the material was softer and more comfortable, she said she would absolutely rock it with this dress! For her, this is a 2 star dress."
2.0,Pretty shoes but way too large. I ordered a toddler size 7 and they're more like a 10.
2.0,One pair was already snapped by the time they got to me.. Very disappointing
2.0,"Much smaller than the picture, disappointed."
2.0,The band looks nice but it is needlessly difficult to adjust the size of the band and there are no instructions. The tool included was cheap and broke almost as soon as I start using it.
2.0,I bought three of these belts and the loop that is supposed to hold the belt is too small to allow the belt to pass thru a second time so I cannot wear it as it is intended to be worn. the other two that i got both fit fine. I think i just got an unlucky pink belt and I was most excited for the pink...
2.0,Absolutely love the saying but super small and cheaply made
2.0,Thin and uncomfortable. Not very water proof
2.0,Came apart after 2 uses at wet n wild
2.0,"Material is cheap, the case is constantly detaching."
2.0,"Gentlemen,<br />I am still expecting my return. I checked my checking account, it is not there.<br />Nothing was wrong with the product itself. It was just to wide and could not get through my belt loops.<br /><br />Joseph"
2.0,Fits snug and weird
2.0,Made for a 6' woman.  I'm 5'2 115 lbs and swimming in the size small that fits more like an XL.  Wayyyy to long and the sleeves are awkwardly big
2.0,This was a large. The other large that I received from same company fit perfectly. The arms don‚Äôt look anything like the pictures
2.0,Doesn't provide enough shade to improve vision
2.0,"I'm a 12-14, but it was too short in the sleeves and length. I'm tall 5'10&#34;.<br /><br />On reorder it was damaged on the right button sleeve.<br /><br />About a week or two of wearing one of the front buttons broke.<br /><br />I'm not very rough with jackets. Poor material for the buttons.<br /><br />It's cool though. Wears out easy."
2.0,"They look pretty sturdy, but they are too small for my full grown chickens. :("
2.0,"Fits as expected but poor quality.  Very thin material.  Faded with one wash and now looks like an old shirt.  Ok, for the price but don't expect high quality."
2.0,So thin good for under a dress or shorts or to hide spanx lol
2.0,Product tore after one try-on
2.0,"Super small, a large fit like basically a regular sweater. Not oversized by any means. Material is decent, basically thick ribbed knit. Decent regular sweater, not a sweater dress or an oversized sweater by a long shot."
2.0,Material thin.. Not like hoodie material.. It is wearable though
2.0,I was very disappointed in the size of this charm for the price. Smallest one on my bracelet. Engraving is almost too small to read.
2.0,"I think that travel cubes in general are great! However, I am a frequent traveler and these could not handle the wear and tear of hard travel. I was backpacking through Europe for months, not one or two trips every few months. Unfortunately the zipper jammed and broke on a few of them and the sides tore away from the zipper. I would not recommend these for a a constant travel trip, but they do help save space so if you only need them for a few trips a year, they are great."
2.0,The material was thinner than I thought.
2.0,"The balls keep falling off and one stripped its threads. Out of 3 pair I have zero that are useable because some have internal threads, some external, so I can't interchange with what I've lost or are no longer useable. I tried a different style one stripped its threads immediately. I did not tighten it too tight given fact the ends fall off so easily. I'll probably order from somewhere else next time."
2.0,"The gloves seem to be of good leather quality though I'm disappointed with the workmanship and sewing. I hope they do not come apart at the end as the stitching is a little shoddy. The fit is on the small side and maybe that is the the reason my hands are still cold inside of<br />them. The insulation is virtually one none existent though comfortable. Not what I expected and a little over priced as a result. Over all I would say they are OK, nothing special and certainly I could have found something similar for less."
2.0,"I like the design, but when I bought these, they were described as leather and the tag inside the tongue even says &#34;Leather upper&#34; - they are clearly faux leather/pleather and the description has been updated to reflect that.  Too good to be true!"
2.0,"The picture looks great, but the necklace in person looks like it might be fake. There is nothing on it to indicate that it is truly a Swarovski crystal. I suspect it is actually glass. It also appears to be from China, which makes me wonder even more if it is a knockoff. It is supposed to be a gift for a family member and I feel like a fraud giving it to her. I don't have time to return it and get something else unfortunately. I am finding that the lightening deals are not always such a real deal after all."
2.0,the  pockes wee sewn wrong had to do alterations
2.0,"The shirt fit like an extra large , the color was very nice and that‚Äôs why it gets two stars, but the shirt arrived late, and I am upset that I know have to run to the post office to return it. I can‚Äôt recommend it."
2.0,I think some photos of someone wearing them would give people a better perspective as to how they fit. They are very narrow on my average (not fat) face. Maybe better for a smaller person or narrow-faced person. Not sure.<br /><br />Definitely UV and polarized. Quality - hard to say. I have had expensive sunglasses die quickly and cheap ones live a long life. These feel like they are in the middle of that.
2.0,Unusually large arm holes. Would work with a hoodie but even The Rock wouldn't go sleeveless with these.
2.0,"My daughter wore these to school and came home with the bottom flapping. Mind you, this was her first time ever wearing these shoes. The bottom sole is a thicker rubber material instead of cheap foam like most boots of this type, so I gave 2 stars for that. But for shoes that a 7 year old will be wearing, they need to be a lot more durable than they are. So disappointing"
2.0,This dress was tight in the stomach and was a little longer than my knees. I'm 5'4. The pockets make it look bunchy.
2.0,"The color of these socks is so cute and the material has a nice thickness. Unfortunately after one wash they have multiple holes in them and still have a very strong chemical smell. I'm not sure I'll be able to salvage them to at least sleep in, but if I can get rid of the smell without them disintegrating I will because they do feel soft."
2.0,cheap material very thin
2.0,The quality is not as expected and I thought the shorts were biker but they are not. A little disappointed.
2.0,My chest is too big for them. There is no support in the straps
2.0,Did not like the material and the quality looks much better in the pictures.
2.0,These lenses did not fit my Asian fit Oakley Flak Jacket XLJ frames.
2.0,"It's okay, but not sure where you can wear this. Very thin material. If you decide to wear a bra or underwear with this you will definitely see it."
2.0,"I haven't tried to clean it up yet, but it doesn't look nearly as good as the picture. It's not shiny, and it just looks tarnished."
2.0,"The fabric on this product is so super thin you could almost see right through it. I cannot wear a dark colored inside shirt with this item because it is so obvious, it shows right through the jacket. The angel wings also seem a little blurry and not well defined at all. I'll cut my losses and keep this, probably hand it off to someone else, but it isn't worth my time to return this item. I really wanted to like this but it is just such a huge disappointment."
2.0,"The shirt looks great in the picture.  However, it looks nothing like this.  The picture is clearly a V neck, but the shirt is a scoop neck.  I got a large, and it fits well enough around but if you're larger than a B cup look for another shirt.  I'm disappointed in this purchase"
2.0,The sides were very loose and the suit fit perfet but there were large gaps under the arms and breast area.
2.0,thin and cheap.  would not recommend.
2.0,"Not a mens large. Asking for a return. Will repost when I get my refund.  Sad, this was a Christmas present"
2.0,Tight on 9 mo old and mittens don‚Äôt really match. Cute tho.
2.0,Design is nice Size fits perfect but fabric is a bad quality almost 50% transparent
2.0,3xl fits like an XL and short too. Print is ok a little off center.  Material is good. Be sure to order 2 sizes up.
2.0,"The fit is weird because the waist of the dress falls above your natural waistline and i am short also the colour of the top part of the dress is not quite blue, looks more purplish"
2.0,Small for expected size.
2.0,The wallet is large enough to carry all my stuff but it only lasts 2-3 months before falling apart. I have bought (5) of them this past year because when they are new they are good. They are low cost solution until I find something better. They are not good enough for me to decide to stop looking for a better wallet. Perhaps some day they will learn how to make a wallet that is large capacity that does not fall apart in 2-3 months.
2.0,"It's pretty but made cheaply, I thought it would be a tougher material but its more plasticy than anything."
2.0,Does not fit a 3x person unfortunately. 3x is more for a 2x person. Length is good. Nice vest if it fit..
2.0,Loved the pattern and it held all my stuff. Had it for 2 weeks and the drawstrings started ripping out of the holes.  Was very sad to return itüò©
2.0,I totally hate these pajamas; they‚Äôre unflattering and make you sweat when wearing them.<br />These are definitely going to the Goodwill.
2.0,"First of all, I made the mistake of not reading the description thoroughly before I ordered them. The ""sauna"" is just at the top. So why the choice with the length? The material is so thin, almost see through. Returning, I don't see how they can be effective."
2.0,"I was really excited and hopeful this dress would be my ""go-to"" but it fell short.  Tight in the belly and hips, so if you are self cautious, this dress does not hide flaws.  Sending this one back."
2.0,Dress was very confusing to get on. Belt was to short
2.0,"I have purchased several dresses on Amazon that are similar to this one that run big and I love them! This one runs quite small especially in the bust. The big problem is that the slits come up WAY too high. I should have just sent it back but I tried to have the slits closed up enough to wear it. Due to the way it's made, that doesn't work because now it bulges out on both sides. Even if I had been ok with the slits almost showing my heinie, the pockets won't lay flat so they look bulgey. I really wanted to like the dress and make it work but it was a waste of money. On the positive side, I love the green color and the lightweight fabric."
2.0,Not true to size..to small
2.0,This item is not as described .
2.0,Too thick for my taste and stone just a little big. Sending to my mom she will love it
2.0,Cool short but Ordered a women‚Äôs large looks more like Women small
2.0,"Too loose in the waist and way too small in the bust area. I consider myself fairly small chested and it ran too small for me. I ordered it in a Large and wear a 36 B cup. Also, the descriptions talks about how great the stitching is, but mine had loose threads everywhere. I returned it."
2.0,I used it and it seemed to clean the shoes but when they dried it left light brown and cream colored marks on my white shoes. When I contacted Crep about the incident and sent pictures they wanted me to send my 250 dollar shoes to them. Seemed a little weird and shady. Maybe good for darker shoes but it was a hit or miss for white shoes.
2.0,"I just received my pants, I really hope they‚Äôre worth the money I spent! Packaged like a $12 pair of pants, rolled up in a plastic  bag, totally wrinkled! Very disappointing... !"
2.0,"The dress is too small. I'm 5""7' and when I tried on the dress I thought it was made for a child or a woman of 5"". While the color is great the fit is all wrong for average height women."
2.0,"The fabric was nice and soft on the inside, but the waist was way too small compared to what the waist is like on my normal size.  I returned the product.  I couldn't use it the way it fit."
2.0,Overpriced...
2.0,These run extremely small and fabric very thin.  Returning all 3 I bought
2.0,"I wanted to like this belt so much... The idea of being able to quickly snap it together really appealed to me. That's not how this belt operates. You would think that once you have it set to your correct waist size, it would be good.. right?<br /><br />Wrong. The belt itself has no ""give"" at all. I have yet to go one day to the next with being able to simply click it and go. In order to get it to fit, one needs to adjust it by either shortening or lengthening the adjustable end. Is it difficult, no. But who want to spend 2 - 3 minutes making sure your belt is adjusted probably?<br /><br />Not me! Think about it. We gain and lose weight daily... even if it's just a fraction of a pound. That combined with the fact that if you don't wear your belt at the exact same location, your either going to struggle getting it clipped or having to tighten it.<br /><br />As ""neat"" of an idea as it is... the functionality is simply not there. Belts shouldn't require this much effort to put on."
2.0,"Like all others here, this one is a bait-n-switch. Contrary to the fun colors represented, I received 2 black and 2 gray. And the quality is substandard. Probably best for you to look elsewhere."
2.0,Nice band for the price but too thin at end to hold clasp on.  Keeps sliding off. Held up to my other Carrera and it's noticeably thinner
2.0,The inside didn't look like it did online.
2.0,Much smaller so if you order this order two sizes larger
2.0,"This looks like a nice dress, but it's made for a person with little to no breasts! Honestly if they had made enough room on top for boobs this would be the perfect dress. The way the dress sits on the body looks really nice.<br />I suggest if you have boobs buy 2 sizes up. Otherwise it may not fit."
2.0,This bead is beautiful and very sparky beautiful bling- because is it so shiny it it easy to see some of teh little jewels fell out.
2.0,Very pretty but to short for my taste it was mid thigh on me and I am only 5'3
2.0,So.small.
2.0,These are poorly made and uncomfortable. I wish I‚Äôd sent them back.
2.0,Great price but extremely see through. They fit great and have nice compression without being too tight.
2.0,Only two because I undesr estimated how small this wold be.  I should've read the reviews.
2.0,It's okay! Doesn't fit right but it was okay. She's only 29 inches tall and 24 lbs.
2.0,Handle broke first time I used it.
2.0,Beautiful Handbag but to small for me
2.0,"Not really happy with this but will keep it.  I wanted a RED cardigan for the holidays, the fit is a little sloppy and it does run small, I am normally a L or XL and got the 2X, not sure if an XL would have been ok or not BUT the color is more orange then red, it is not something for the holidays.  Extremely disappointed in the color, the picture looks to be very RED but I would classify it as orange/red.  SO if looking for a pretty red cardigan this is NOT it"
2.0,Nice but size ran way too small but my nephew liked it kid tho
2.0,"Please read before you buy: this material is Modal which should definitely be considered and researched before you purchase it. Modal is a blend of rayon and cotton made from cellulose. I won't go into detail but I do believe that should be stated as a warning due to the double dose of the you'll be wearing. As far as sizing, rayon is a form of spandex and cotton shrinks, this isn't as fitted due to the cotton but it will hug your curves. Also, you should  ALWAYS hand wash in cold water and hang dry rayon. The elastic waistband is just below the bust all the way around the shirt, the bottom does flair somewhat. The XL fits like a women's petite small or junior's medium. I'm 5'5, 141pds. (36D,28,39) The neckline is extremely cute, the sleeves are are long which I like and the hemline ends just above my bottom. Unfortunately, I've already cut a good deal of increasing amounts of loose stitching from the inside and out, so I don't think it will last long. It's cute, I just wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,to big and it fits ugly
2.0,"This was advertised as Titanium as I‚Äôm allergic to gold, nickel, sterling silver & surgical steel.  I was only able to wear it for a day and I started having a reaction."
2.0,"They were too small, did not even fit any of us! Only a child would have been able to wear them! I want them in a bigger size. The ones I got can not be used!"
2.0,The shirts that we bought were kind of small. But we like them and they are cute thank you guys
2.0,"It was too small for 12.  My daughter is about 60% in height and weight so I purchased age 12 to be safe, but the arms are too short and the body fit is too tight.  Sleeves look like quarter sleeve on her."
2.0,"It's suffercating, the material is not good, and the fabric give out bad odor when received."
2.0,"This item.was misleading in the fact it states in.the title ""Summer Casual TShirt Dress"" and is represented as a short sleeve T-Shirt. It is not short sleeve or a TShirt and not very fitting for summer considering the material I'd cotton and it is very warm and Long sleeved. They roll the sleeves up in photos advertising the dress making you think is it short sleeve until you receive it you do not know it is in fact long sleeved ."
2.0,"This mask is lovely except that it fits too close to your face. Adjusting the straps leaves it gaping open on the sides, leaving you with minimal protection."
2.0,The pictures do not match the product you are getting. I bought these for my husband and he was expecting the legs to be full wrap around like the picture shows but they weren‚Äôt and all the buckles were seen on backwards! We will be returning these!
2.0,Pretty and very thick. It is soft not itchy! However it runs very small. The length is good but width is tight. I ordered a Medium and it was too tight. I returned it and ordered an XL. The size difference was barely noticeable. The XL was also very tight. I am usually a size small.
2.0,"Ok. Cheap China brand üòï. Was expecting a better fit since I ordered the largest size available. Biggest size will fit a woman SZ 2. I'm a 4-6, 5'3&#34; 138 lbs and it wouldn't go past my thighs. I don't have large thighs either..."
2.0,"I ordered 2X and received what I would consider a ""large"".  Not accurate."
2.0,"This is a solid piece with a solid chain (which is unusual).  But it's not very pretty.  The back (not that it matters to most people) has an ugly oxidized look to it.  The chain is uncomfortable.  The front is very shiny.  The price is very good.  So what, you may be asking yourself is it I am complaining about?  All I can tell you is that I bought it for a friend for St. Patrick's Day and then felt it was not good enough to give her."
2.0,"Didn't fit at all, oversized"
2.0,"The material is pretty crappy. And isn't as long,as showed. I wouldn't purchase this again."
2.0,Like the material but way too tight and I even ordered the next size up.
2.0,"This scarf is metallic gold, not yellow like the picture shows. I returned it because it was so ugly."
2.0,"I don't care for how these fit on my head.  They slip to much and do not stay put.  I am going to use them for washing my face, but not to go out in."
2.0,Was the weirdest fit ever. Crouch area was to my knees. Not quite sure what was going on with it. Product returned
2.0,"I have been on an extensive hunt for black yoga pants that are not see-through and that are not Lulu Lemon. The product description and costumer reviews all said these pants were not see-through. Well... They're see-through. Sigh. I have definitely seen yoga pants that are worse, but if you're doing a downward dog in some unfortunate lighting, you're going to show your undies to the whole gym. They also run a teeny bit large. I don't hate them for lounging around, but I won't be wearing these to work out in public. My hunt for public-appropriate yoga pants continues...."
2.0,The fabric is cheap and itchy. Fit and look are nice but I can‚Äôt wear them because I itch too much!
2.0,"Being generous on the two stars. Does run small. Cheap iron ~ on lettering which will surely not last long after a few washings :( fabric isn‚Äôt too bad, pretty comfy!"
2.0,Big in the shoulders and not fit as expected
2.0,"Or more importantly my cats do not like it.  They will not go near the stuff, which is very strange given how crazy they normally are about cat nip."
2.0,Material brakes down too soon
2.0,cute but gets caught very easily on everything
2.0,"I really liked these at first because they didn‚Äôt show at all, but they quickly became too stretched out and loose and started bunching  up to where they were visible if wearing things like leggings. I still wore them under jeans, but then they started coming apart on the sides. I didn‚Äôt realize it at first, but they‚Äôre not even sewn together on the sides. They appear to be glued together, which would explain why they‚Äôre coming apart."
2.0,Not true to size was extremely small. The bottoms are see threw no mesh inside.
2.0,Tried it on when I got it. Looked great. Halloween however it never made it on since the cheapest smallest zipper ever broke. Waste of money.
2.0,A little tight when I got them and then they shrunk a lot when washed and dried.
2.0,Super cutel but much to big for my small waist. Guess I missed I couldn't pick my size. I'm pretty disappointed.
2.0,"No me gust√≥, me qued√≥ muy grande a pesar que uso esa talla. No la pude usar"
2.0,Very cheap material for the price. Looks better in picture.
2.0,"I ordered the blue & white dress with the leathery belt. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and it almost hit my ankles. Yet, the top fit in a weird way. It wouldn‚Äôt be a dealbreaker if it wasn‚Äôt for the noisy fabric. Not great for wearing casually, but good as a costume piece."
2.0,The skirt part on these leggings are way too short. ..at least for me.
2.0,Beautiful ring but don't wear it while washing hands one time and the writing fades drastically and the cross. Very disappointed
2.0,they do not last long
2.0,SUPER thin material
2.0,did not give me the hat that is advertised
2.0,"The sweater itself is very nice and warm, but the pockets are a joke.<br />They are a kind of light mesh that are way too shallow, and they are not sown to the sweater on the bottom.<br />If you put your hands in the pockets when the sweater is unzipped, it looks as though you are wearing undersized cheap mittens that are flapping all over the place.<br />I would not recommend this sweater to anyone."
2.0,Broke immediately too flimsly.such a cute design but dissapointed with how fast it broke considering the price
2.0,I thought this was gonna be a thin fabric that had good movement but the fabric is thick and it fits like a barrel.  I gave it to my mom and she likes it.
2.0,Way to small for the size it says! Order up if you want a looser fit!
2.0,"Definitely not my favorite, the chain is to long."
2.0,Made backwards. Ripped off the flowers and feathers and repositioned them correctly and with additional feathers I bought on Amazon. Netting also had to be removed and repositioned. I also added wide ribbon to it. It worked fine as a basic shape but not acceptable without reworking.
2.0,my wife bought this and loved it but was very upset about the false advertising of the buttons. they are not fake pearl buttons they are normal pink buttons she was rather let down.
2.0,Some Tassel threads loose and stringing.  Will return
2.0,The fit was accurate. The lace top was really cute but I didn't expect the bottom part to be really stiff. Almost like the top and bottom weren't supposed to go together.
2.0,Wayyyy too big! I ordered it for my toddler a<br />Girl and it literally came in a size for big girls. Super large on her
2.0,not at all what it appeared to be.  Would not purchase again.  Very cheap quality.  Gave it to my grandaughter/
2.0,You get what you pay for. They are not high quality but they are enough for my teenage son.
2.0,Liked the color but the fabric wrinkles.
2.0,"it hurts my head to wear it, disappointed."
2.0,"I am not happy with this purchase.  The hat is advertized as foldable and that is how it arrives, folded up in a plastic bag.  It looks nothing like the pretty picture.  No instructions on how to fluff to remove the creases and make it look like a hat.  I have tried smoothing it out to reshape and fluff it up but it keeps folding back up.  Maybe it will win worst hat at the Derby party.üòû I'll stick with purchases I can do in person, this wasn't a good experience."
2.0,"the 1st time i wore them i noticed i had to fight to get the button to fit in the hole, and back out, really sucked when i had to go to the bathroom. then the button came out from the back, which actually was able to rebutton that way. then a hole developed at the base of the zipper, I'm not sure if it came like that or developed after a couple wears. also i got the laegest size thinking it would be fine, but way too tight"
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the shirt. Material was very stiff and didn‚Äôt sit on my shoulders well or taper down my back very well. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù 155 with athletic build and ordered size small for reference. I don‚Äôt think ordering another size would have changed my preference for the shirt. Ended up returning
2.0,Very thin and cheaply made. Not at all worth the price
2.0,"Fitting was simple and very easy. The goggles worked well for the first hour but then the left side started letting water in.  I attempted to tighten it a bit thinking maybe they had gotten loose when I took them off, but no luck water still poured in when I went underwater. I'm not sure what happened. I tried them again the next day but the same results.  I received this product  at a lower price for an honest review."
2.0,Ordered my size large and was way too small.
2.0,"Pretty colors, however, package came with 9 pieces and 3 of them were broken."
2.0,"I wear a size 10 in every boot known to man kind, however, when I received these they were a little loose for a size 10. They were comfortable but too loose. I was going to swap them for a 9.5 but not after I paid $114.00 for them and then having to pay $25.00 to send them back to Australia!"
2.0,"Was hoping this anti-fog spray would help with eyeglass fogging while wearing masks.  It helps a ""little"" but no where near totally doing the job.  I followed instructions to the letter but my glasses still fog up, a little less but no 5 star rating.  Sorry!"
2.0,"Cheap made, not like movie. Worst ever. NOT WICK, sorry, like other products."
2.0,Logo fell off after about a week.  Couldnt fix cause i dont know where it fell out.
2.0,"One shoe fits fine, the other is practically cutting my circulation off. QC definitely needs to be stepped up!"
2.0,They snag on everything. Wore them with boots and they showed wear places all around the boots after one wear.
2.0,It makes a nice house dress but wouldn't wear in public
2.0,Super cute! However I only received 9 vice 10 headbands and 2 of them were the same.
2.0,"I bought a pair of these earrings in 2016 or 2017 and loved them... last year I gave them away to a lady who would always compliment me on them. I bought another pair beginning of this year and they are way smaller. I love the saying, but if I would have known how small they would have been I would have gotten a different pair of earrings. If you don't mind small to medium size earrings these are fine... but if you like them big with your afro, these are not the ones."
2.0,"No way. The ladies in the photos look so cute but the outfit I received is not cute. At all. Ordered Khaki - looks nothing like Khaki. Looks nothing like anything I would wear in public or to bed. Im not boasting but I look cute in anything from sweats to dresses. Mini dresses & maxi. Capris to short shorts. Tennis, sandals, heels, flip flops. This is not cute on me whatsoever. Not cute to me. Seller was reasonable so I will give a two stars. Im going to try them as lounge seperates. My bf doesnt like it either."
2.0,Cute print but sizing is not for kids. The socks advertised as kids size 7-10 and that‚Äôs what I was looking for. Fits 7.5 adult size
2.0,Fur us matted and awful. Took a week and they said next day shipping. Gett8ng a refund. Product is awful.
2.0,This ring was super comfy and I thought was really cute but the stones started falling off within days. It made me sad.
2.0,"If you have a sensitivity to itchy clothing don't buy this cap. I bought this for my daughter but she refuses to wear it due to the elastic material that is meant to keep the cap on during the night. It's a great concept because who wants a cap that falls off in the middle of the night, but it is not comfortable at all. :-("
2.0,"I had bought the exact same case twice. The first one lasted 2 months and broke at all 4 corners. The second one lasted 10 days. It's a pretty case and I loved the ring on the back but it does nothing to protect the phone. I just spent $300 for a repair when my phone fell out of my pocket in this case. Unfortunately the repair was a good wakeup call, had to get a better one."
2.0,Earring broke before I even wore them. I‚Äôm glad they were inexpensive but very disappointing
2.0,"It has a fashionable design and a popping color. It's also the perfect size for me, (not too big and not too small). The quality of material is quite poor and the workmanship is even worst. It's jokingly called the zombie bag because the appendages periodically tear off and I have to reattach with glue or thread. It's certainly not made for daily use. I would not recommend this bag based on the bad quality."
2.0,"Bracelet was nice, but one of the cz diamonds was missing - returned for refund."
2.0,To stiff has a permanent crease from being folded in the pkg. I'm on the fence with this.
2.0,Gen is way bigger then we expected.
2.0,"I was so hopeful for these leggings. I wanted a baby pink but these were more of a rose pink. I'm typically a sm/med but I like my leggings tight, so I ordered a small. They fit more like a medium and run bigger. I ended up giving them to my sister."
2.0,I expected them to at least last for a day. The clasp broke before being worn.
2.0,"I just received an order for the L'eggs thigh highs, used the 1st pair yesterday when I went to church.<br /> By the time I got home one 1 had stayed up; the other one had fallen down below my knee!! I had a dress on so this was very embarrassing and uncomfortable as I walking.<br /><br />I am very disappointed and don't know if I should try another pair (since I ordered 6 pair) or return them."
2.0,"I ordered 3 different dresses from 3 different companies and this one has pros and cons.  The pro is the fabric is the heaviest of the 3 dresses, but the arm holes are so large my bra shows when I raise my arm and the dress has no slit and tapers in at the ankles so I can't walk comfortably in it.  Side pockets stick out funny too!  Not keeping this one.:("
2.0,"The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" rings true here. Was not happy with the workmanship. No details in the ring. Feathers look strange. Nothing like the item shown in the pics. Good fit though and arrived early."
2.0,I bought these for my 8yr old.  She wore it for half a day at home and it already coming apart.  We loved the patterns and how it felt but not happy with the durability.
2.0,"The only thing that I didn't like about the dress, was that it was very big around the hips. If you don't have hips I wouldn't suggest it, but maybe I just got a defect. Definitely returned the dress."
2.0,Not at all like picture. Cute but not what i wanted kinda plain and ugly. Not worth it
2.0,"Item does run small, does not fall off the shoulder as shown. The material is very thin. I wear a small but got a large."
2.0,"The gloves are of a lower quality than I expected.<br />I was hoping for better, but it is what it is."
2.0,This cz ring would have been a welcomed purchase if there wasn't a large space between two of the stones. The space is very noticeable and takes away from the uniformity of the band. Not impressed with this purchase.
2.0,"The fit is so weird, it should be off the shoulder with the lace acting like the straps, but it's sewn too close together so it just looks like I have lace bra straps showing and my shirt is falling down."
2.0,"Cute outfit, except the shorts faded in color in the second wash. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying only due to this."
2.0,Low quality reprint
2.0,Warm and cozy. But.....I am a size 6... And they barely fit! Several pair have ripped in the seams.
2.0,Were a lot smaller than expected
2.0,I thought these were mid rings. they are nice but too big. they fit my pinky sort of. not really. just trying to make use of them cus they are plain and cute. just too big!
2.0,Sunglasses were super cute but are obviously not well designed for children. My son wore them once and dropped them on our tile kitchen floor and a single drop left a large scratch on the lens. Other reviewers had the same issue so I thought they were just rough on them. I would return them if I could.
2.0,"Because of the price, I bought both the brown and black faux leather belt.  The belts look good and are a good size in width.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in a weeks, both belts have started to show wear and tear on edges of the belts.  This won't last long!"
2.0,The mask is overly large and not formfitting to the face. It‚Äôs A little too heavy which makes it uncomfortable to wear.
2.0,"Beautiful color, but the flower arrived completely flat; flat as a pancake, maybe flatter even. I‚Äôve tried fluffing it up but it seems to be frozen in it‚Äôs flat state. I think it would be perfect if it had some dimension to it. I‚Äôll still wear it, but it‚Äôs definitely not my favorite."
2.0,"This watch crapped out after a year and four months.  Just stopped working.  It also had trouble with waterproofing.  The knob had to be tighted enough to keep water out, but not too much because it would stop the watch movement.  Pretty much a piece of junk."
2.0,"I tried viv's plus size legging and loved them, so I thought their plus size tunic would fit as well. But no. It's unflatteringly snug across the back and the pockets stick out at the sides. I wear a US 2XL or a 20W. It also has that horrible smell that some clothes have. I felt like I needed to shower after trying it on out of the package."
2.0,Not wide enough.
2.0,"From the pictures this looked like a dress with a regular waist, but the waistline is very high - even getting a larger size than I thought I'd need the dress was really short, more like a tunic, and the waistline sat just below my bust in a really unflattering way. What a shame! Might be cute on someone else, but didn't fit at all as pictured."
2.0,"I thought this was a hat. It‚Äôs more like a neck gaiter that could be used as a face covering too. It‚Äôs cute & fairly soft, but it is NOT a ‚Äúhat‚Äù. They should remove that word from the description and show both openings in the photos. A bit misleading."
2.0,Some came broken or without earing backs.
2.0,I love the looks of the shoe.  It needs to have a variety of widths.  I tried three different sizes in order to get one that would work by width and I was unable to do so.  Needs to have wider than D widths.
2.0,"I tried it on and realized it was ripped, I also have 2 others that are not ripped and the mesh matched the bra!"
2.0,"Nice variety of colors,  they are all different sizes. Way to big for my baby's head. I purchased when she was 2 months old. Now she is 8 months and only 2 of the colors fit."
2.0,Wasn't like the picture color different than the picture not happy with it
2.0,The problem with these pants is they're shiny polyester type material.  I've purchased 4 different pairs and the only pair that I love and feels more like cotton are the black ones.  All the others are thin polyester that show every dimple and imperfection.  It's weird that they're not all made of the same material.
2.0,It fits everywhere else quite well... however if you are even semi well endowed you will fall out. I had to risk safety pins all night...
2.0,"It's  cute but very cheap quality, I was expecting something better."
2.0,"Actually nice quality, but very small and tight.  I would say these are average size."
2.0,"2nd review, it Didn't fit."
2.0,"Well I played the game and lost. After reading mixed reviews I was prepared for what I got, very thin material. The kind that‚Äôs silky and behaves like water in your hands.<br />Unfortunately this leaves no room for error in the stitching of the star comprised of the same material.. my star was stitched crooked and the weight of the material pulls it to the most unflattering droopy/stretched position. I plan to just replace the straps, The rest of the ‚Äúdress‚Äù is salvageable for a super light summer dress/shirt. Certainly needs something under it, might work as a swim suit cover."
2.0,Seem fragile
2.0,"All bracelets and anklets were pretty. I wished to share them with my granddaughters, however 3 of them broke within 3 days"
2.0,I kept it but I wouldn't buy it again.
2.0,They are very pretty but a lot smaller than expected.  I was also concerned that they seemed very delicate.
2.0,Did not work for using my phone with the gloves on!
2.0,The product was good but in the picture it look bigger but to my surprise it was small
2.0,Very disappointed. The picture shows a palette with different colored paints. What I received was a palette & all of the paints were black- so silver & black - no colors.
2.0,It fit around the waist just fine but it fits weirdly. In the shirt it doesn‚Äôt have elastic so there‚Äôs nothing holding it in the way it should. The pants are baggy in the front giving it an awkward look to it.
2.0,"I have various credit cards and membership cards so the many slots available was a big part of my decision to buy. However, I have found inserting/removing the cards to be VERY difficult. I had decided to return, but now I am going to try it out to see if the slots stretch with use. Also, I was hoping to store my iphone6+; it fits, but it makes the wallet too thick to zip closed."
2.0,Looks like tablecloth on me it will collect dust in my closet üòû
2.0,Quality of material and seamstress was something to desire. 100% cotton and shrunk drastically!
2.0,I really liked the looks of this hat with the U.S Army embroidered and the Army Seal. Two problems I have with this hat. 1. the Army seal is not straight on the front. Its kind of off to one side. It almost looks like the brim was not sewed on the hat straight?? 2. The clasp in the back of the hat does not hold the hat adjustment at all. I had to sew it together the keep in the spot that fits me. Me as an Army Vet I'm very particular to detail and the detail of this hat is way off in my opinion. I'm not very happy with this hat because of these defects. I would like to have another one but I'm afraid to pay another 30.00 and get the same issue. I will likely find me a different one.
2.0,"The material was okay. A little heavy, but not the usual cheaply made clothing that is available for this kind of price on Amazon. However, the sizing was pretty off. I chose an XS, which fit my exact measurements on the chart, and it was loose and too long. If you are usually an XS or sometimes S in dresses, this might not fit as it does in the picture."
2.0,"I have 4 of these, and the lt grey is not the same material as the others. It's more like a cotton tee, whereas the others fit more like a jersey material. Lt. grey was not as stretchy, and tight, compared to the others. Will buy again, but will return if similar to grey one."
2.0,"I got the ones described as &#34;D5-3 Pairs&#34; (the pack of gray socks that come almost half way up the foot). They are pretty comfortable--though not as breathable as I would like, and there is no thick seam that digs into your foot. The first time I wore them they stayed up all day. The second time I wore them the fell down constantly while I was walking and even while I was sitting at my desk. It's a shame because otherwise they seem well made."
2.0,Picture does not match the way the product.
2.0,"Super cute, my kid loves them..... but they cracked within 3 months of normal kid use. Not super surprising for a cheap sandal but still a bummer. I‚Äôll buy a better quality item for our next pair of slides."
2.0,Did not fit as expected. Way too short and too small in the chest area.
2.0,The keychain was nice but broke within a few days.
2.0,See through and big and made very square fabric sucks
2.0,"Had high hopes for the three pack but was unfortunately let down. They run small (even ordering a size up), are most definitely see-through, and oddly are very scratchy. They don‚Äôt stretch as well as I‚Äôd hoped and they are not soft at all. I love the colors but I can‚Äôt wear them anywhere so they‚Äôre basically trash now. I‚Äôd keep looking even though they are a good price."
2.0,"I loved the shoe clips and they fit perfectly on my daughter's shoes, BUT they only lasted an hour.  The jewel in the middle fell off both shoes so they didn't last for the rest of the event.  I would not recommend these if you want to wear them longer than an hour."
2.0,"Quality seems good, but these were defiantly not knee high. They hit me maybe mid calf and I don't think they would have stayed up.  I ordered a 2x per the measuring instructions (measured multiple times) but these were way too short.  I sent them back."
2.0,"Very beautiful when they arrived. However, after a few weeks, they started turning rusty and green. Made my ears itch. I would not recommend these to anyone."
2.0,Looked more red than pink. Disappointed. Returned item.<br /><br />The blue one was weak.<br /><br />Only the orange and green one were just as described.
2.0,"The mask came and I was very excited however the filters that come with the mask do not fit the shape of the mask at all. Secondly there is a band that velcros behind your head which pulls down on your nose. Causes discomfort and with the filter problem, it just doesn't work.....it's just a fancy looking fabric mask."
2.0,"Really cheap fabric, like not even Forever 21 quality. The fit was super weird, for reference, I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and about 150lbs. and they we‚Äôre oddly long (I ordered a size medium). The ‚Äúbag‚Äù part at the top of the shorts were not like the picture shown either. They‚Äôre going into my scrap pile of fabric now."
2.0,"Absolutely love these blouses and have ordered three of them. Five stars for colors, fit and design. But all three are permanently wrinkled. I have tried ironing them, washing<br />and hang drying and machine drying - and nothing works to remove the wrinkles. I'm going to bring them to a professional dry cleaner to see if that will resolve the issue  Certainly last noticeable in<br />Black then the other colors but it's very disappointing and never looks quite right."
2.0,The quality of the dress is poor
2.0,I bought this hat mostly for the clear shield visor protection over my face. The  plastic portion is not very clear and difficult to see through with clarity which defeats the purpose of what I bought it for. The top portion of the hat is also a thin nylon material which I doubt affords sun protection.<br />This is cheaply made and not worth the money.
2.0,Wasn't the same color as picture so I was the odd ball out for the family Christmas photo shoot
2.0,The socks were too small and the material was so thin the material tore the first time I wore them.
2.0,"The large bottle ""for home use"" does not have a sprayer with it which means you have to go buy a different bottle.  Seems to work OK, but that is very inconvenient."
2.0,Material is very cheap feeling. Didn't get any better after washing
2.0,"Way too big, returning"
2.0,I bought it and it felt great just the logo was off center so I don't wear it too often unless it's under a sweatshirt.
2.0,It's fitted so I'd order one size larger than usual AND it doesn't lay off the shoulder loosley; you have to pull each side over your shoulders so it's not like the picture shows
2.0,"Little on the small side, but looks good. I am 5'11&#34; 170lbs and consider myself a Normal / athletic build. I ordered a 4XL (which was said to be a US medium) and it is too big. 3xl would have probably fit well."
2.0,Made too small. I wear a mefium and XL too small.
2.0,"The edges of the Tallit have threads coming off of them. The Tzitzit are very poorly knotted, with threads that are worn almost all the way through. These wouldn't even pass for &#34;seconds.&#34; Given they are very inexpensive, but in this case you really get what you pay for--not much. Do not buy."
2.0,"I‚Äôve been told that jack and jones product in store and online were different and I can say it is true, I bought the exact same jeans in store a year before this one and can still wear it, this one teared itself appart after a month"
2.0,"Bonita pero para que quede como en la foto, la modelo debe ser xs y no muy alta, no es cierto que pueda adaptarse a varias tallas, me qued√≥ muy ce√±ido en los brazos y la parte inferior de la camisa ni si quiera puedo cerrar los botones, adicionalmente la tela a rayas es totalmente sint√©tica, ten√≠a muchas espectativas y no voy a poder usar la pieza, lo voy a regalar :-("
2.0,Much larger than described but nice and durable
2.0,Snags on everything and now broke.
2.0,"Cheaply made. My opinion, tossed in trashed."
2.0,I ordered a large (Usually wear a size small).. and the arms were too short and it was a little too tight.  The arms are what really bothered me..
2.0,no lumunance
2.0,Picture is definitely prettier than it actually is.  Colors seem &#34;off&#34; to me and there isn't a lot of shape to the dress.  It runs small in sizing and I would most definitely NOT purchase this again.  Definitely a waste of money for me.  :(
2.0,"I ordered according to the size chart, but I have no idea how this dress is supposed to look good on someone. It is way too wide and while it is too short to wear by itself, it is too long to look right with leggings or shorts (IMHO). The sleeves were also too long and wide. Not for me. 2 stars because I did get it really quickly and it can be returned for a full refund."
2.0,"Very cheap quality and sizing is a bit on the smaller size. They will have to suffice for now, but I wouldn‚Äôt order again."
2.0,Uglier in person and super tight around the chest..  and im about 34 inch.
2.0,"Loved these, cute and lots of compliments BUT second pair now and both have had very little life on the elastic behind the little buckle ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wears out quick then the straps don‚Äôt stay on your heel ...bums me out"
2.0,"I am usually an XL, I ordered this in a 4XL bc reviews said it runs 2 sizes small. The sleeves are very long, the cardigan length is not what the photo shows. It does not cover the back end. The material is okay, I'll have to see when its washed. Overall its cheap but doable."
2.0,Overall it's comfortable and stretchy. Plan on using as base layer during hunting this year. Only reason I'm knocking some stars off is it came with stains on it. Most noticable on the logo b/c is white. Looks like mildew. I tried washing it and didn't change. I'm not returning as hunting starts too soon and I need the shirt but definitely not happy to get a stained shirt. I guess no one will notice since it's a base layer but still not thrilled.
2.0,The sweater is not the same color as the picture online. It is more of a light green.
2.0,"These earrings are very tiny, suitable for a 2 to 5 year old child, but not for any other age group."
2.0,This is tail ike way huge for a for a child I got it for my five year old and it‚Äôs really big and the ears have a really bad Bobby pin on the end. Better for an adult who wants a really big tail
2.0,"I should have listened to the reviews above and saved myself from ordering it . But the dress looks so pretty I couldn't hold myself from ordering. It a beautiful dress but I think it's a hit or a miss! being 36D I ordered a medium, it's weirdly loose there. Also it is very see through. The dress arrived all wrinkly. Overall unhappy with it so returning it."
2.0,I ordered a 2xl and it fits more like a xl. Good quality and thick pants but the sizing is off.
2.0,"Top does not drape like the picture, and the belt loops stick out really far. I think this one is going back."
2.0,"The clasp is very difficult to adjust, and is very difficult to closesecurely"
2.0,"The lens is much darker than shown. It's really not a rose ! More of an amber ! So , I was disappointed"
2.0,After a month there are large holes in most of the lace
2.0,"I was enamored with the design of this ring.  The price point should have tipped me off, but upon receiving it I loved it even more. A gorgeous little ring! It's open-ended, implying easy resizing, but I would not recommend it.  On my first attempt at stretching the opening, the ring broke in two.  I attempted to glue and solder it back together and eventually gave up and tossed it. It was a real shame.  But, if you don't plan on trying to stretch it, It's a gorgeous little ring!"
2.0,Queda peque√±o debe comprar uno o dos size m√°s grandes para que la parte superior quede bien
2.0,Mis-sized<br />Ordered XL; fits more like L.<br />Returning
2.0,a couple of the zippers broke after first use- one of the handles ripped off. pretty cheap material.
2.0,This shirt is very boxy not like picture shown
2.0,"Nice hoodie, great bright yellow color and pretty soft EXCEPT this runs SUPER small. I got the size 10 kid. It doesnt fit my 6 year old (56 pounds). I even checked the tag to make sure they didnt send the wrong size. They didn't. Size 10. This jacket is tiny. Wish it fit. I have to return due to sizing issue."
2.0,No letters. Just a blank crop top that was a bit too big and didnt fit right.
2.0,It's worked great for two uses then they stopped charging. Have a very disappointed 3 year old! Lost window to return.
2.0,"Love the style, hated the cheap quality material. Had to wear it as a pajama top too see through. Hate when that happens. Would not purchase again."
2.0,Quality of sticking on letters very poor
2.0,"Adorable print, but measurements listed for sizes aren't accurate at all. I ordered the medium, and expected the bust to be at least 36 inches (my bust is 35.5, so it was just about perfect), but the bust on this was definitely closer to 32. I was smooshed!"
2.0,"I don't like the fit, sleeves are to long, more like a 4x, med section fits like a 2x."
2.0,Not really good for hiking but probably work amazing when going to a four star dinner
2.0,Cheap looking up close
2.0,"This was not as nice as I was hoping.  The issues I had were as follows:<br />- Many, many loose threads on the shirt that needed to be cut and/or burned to hopefully keep the sewed edges from unraveling.<br />- The collar is very big....bigger than I like.<br />- The shirt was a little bigger than the same size shirt in more expensive brand names....not too big but still bigger.  If it were not for the items above, I would be ok with the size."
2.0,These were pretty but one had rhinestones missing and they aren't adjustable and wouldn't stay on my nose....
2.0,Cute bathing suit but wore it twice and anchor broke off already
2.0,"Great sunglasses, but you can get them off of the brand's actual website for 8 dollars less at the moment and 10 dollars less than what I bought them for."
2.0,Difficult to get on and the bottoms are super small.
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute but runs way too small!! Size up at least one, maybe two sizes!"
2.0,"So pretty, but way too big in the shoulders but too small in the midsection.  It just didn't fit &#34;right&#34;"
2.0,"So comfortable, but see through. I bought a large and an XL (I wear a large) and both pairs were completely see through."
2.0,The flower screen printing looks cheap. I returned the item.
2.0,"These shoes have an odd insole. There's a cushioned area under the ball of the foot, but it's raised so much higher than the rest of the sole it's awkward. They are not very comfortable and continue to rub sores on my heels despite having worn them several times and with no show dress socks."
2.0,"It looks cute in the picture but I had to wear a shirt under it because the shirt was so large. I'm 5'1 and the small was too large. The shirt looks somewhat strange on the sides, different than in the picture. I don't think the shirt is worth $30 at all."
2.0,Too big üò©üò© need the smaller version of these
2.0,The size was wrong because they were to small.
2.0,Fabric ripped off. I just wore once. I will not buy again
2.0,"Cheap bonded leather, not genuine."
2.0,"When I finally got it, it looked like a girls outfit. Not a boys"
2.0,Small as hell- I wear as a top.
2.0,Sort of a cheap material the cut is also weird. Crosses over chest bust has a baggy/extra material under one arm pit. Also shirt is short near the belly button. Not sure if I‚Äôd wear this out. Will probably return
2.0,"I puchased this sandals for my daughter. The first time she wore them, stones started to fell off the sandal. I managed to reattach them to the sandal, but they kept felling off. My daughter only got to wear them on three occassions before they started ripping from the thong. BAD QUALITY!! I'm returning them to Amazon for a refund. They're useless!"
2.0,Too small and the sewing is really bad.
2.0,Doesnt fit correctly in shoulders and the shorts roll down when sitting.
2.0,The jumpsuit runs smaller than expected and the latex mask came folded in the package so there is a massive crease down the middle. The hood is also very small and barely fits over my head and mask. Poor quality.
2.0,"I bought this specifically because I wanted to monitor the temperature when hiking/backpacking.  Since it only works when off your wrist (and it takes time to acclimate and was not very accurate), it was useless to me.  Lots of other nice features (not intuitive to me to remember how to use them all), but since the compelling reason I bought this came up short, I can't give it more than two stars."
2.0,"I love the way this looks and feels, but the purse chain immediately snapped when I started carrying it around the day I got it. It took one of the loops off and now I use it as a clutch or a wristlet."
2.0,Looks weird with three tones/strips I didn't like it
2.0,"I have bought the Starfish brand for years. Because I tend to be heavier in the hips I usually buy a large. That large is usually a 12-14 fit. The large is now 14-16. It also comes up SO high that even a smaller size couldn't possibly fit the description of  ""mid rise"" unless you were a giraffe. The legs are straight, if you consider straight leg to be the same size around your thigh as your ankle. They are still comfortable but hardly flattering. Returning. There is a $3.50 charge to return."
2.0,These stretch and continuously fall off which is not ideal for a 15 month old.
2.0,"The metal is soft, bent the first time I used them.  They are adequate for their purpose, but I would prefer a much sturdier product."
2.0,It fell apart the first week I had it. I would not recommend it.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress, it's so pretty.  I ordered the blue in small, according to their measurements the bust is 29.9, my bust is not big at all (34) but other reviews stated that it has stretch to it so I took a gamble. The bust area was gigantic! I don't understand, the only thing I  could think of was someone else wore it and stretched the crap out of it. The slip under the lace would not stay up, the sleeves also were stretched out. Unfortunately I had to return and couldn't wear it."
2.0,I really was upset with this necklace it looked well made  One of the teardrops were crooked to the side and was very obvious that it was not supposed to be that way. Tried to bend it back myself but it it was actually made that way and crooked.
2.0,had to sell them to someone else not true to size
2.0,"The band looks lovely, but the clasp frequently comes undone. Tonight, it came undone and my smart watch fell off, hit the concrete and the screen shattered/cracked. Not worth it."
2.0,"Just opened up my package and am very disappointed to see a hole in the neck line. Other than that, I love the look and feel of the shirt."
2.0,The seams were very poorly done so they don't lay flat.
2.0,"Maybe I just got a dud.  The clip to hold your key, let go within a week and almost lost my car key."
2.0,I ordered the purple and when it was delivered I thought it was the wrong dress as it is more of a navy blue than a bright purple.
2.0,Very cheap and if you have any remotely larger head than normal do not buy it
2.0,"The dress is pretty but it does not look like the picture. I'm 5'3 and the dress stops an inch above the knee maybe shorter for taller women. The sweater material is soft, stretchy and comfortable. The dress is not one size fits all, it runs small. It fits more like a bodycon dress than a Aline dress."
2.0,"This material is like thin swimsuit and it‚Äôs horrid! If it were cotton, this would be cute!"
2.0,"While I typically love this brand, this watch just looks cheap.  The face is alright but even it looks too plastic like.  If you were buying this for a young teen or simply a fashion watch maybe but not for daily use."
2.0,These shirts tend to ride up on the back or stomach.  Too short!
2.0,"The wrap is thinner than I thought it would be for a winter wrap. The item came in a vacumn bag, I still haven't  ben able to get it unwrinkled"
2.0,"When I received this the deer was upside down on the chain, so when you would try to wear it, one side was tight and the other side was really loose. It was fairly easy to fix with a pair of pliers though, so since I only spent about $3 it didn't really matter."
2.0,"These socks aren‚Äôt thick enough for outdoor activities, especially hiking"
2.0,Cute but not all long as show!
2.0,Tiny. Very small. Expected a bigger size.
2.0,Way smaller then expected thought they were bigger not sure if I can still use them.
2.0,Sleeves are way too tight
2.0,"I wanted to like this long sleeve white linen shirt, but it is undersized, and the quality wasn't what I need it to be.<br /><br />First note, I'm a 2XL shirt wearer and I ordered this product based on the sizing chart and unfortunately, it fits like a Large shirt.  It was so small I wasn't even able to get the shirt buttoned.  I would recommend ordering two sizes up if you go with this.<br /><br />There were also some concerns regarding the quality of the shirt as some of the buttonholes were sewn irregularly and had an open appearance even though they've never been buttoned before.  See the photos attached.<br /><br />The fabric of the shirt is very nice and lightweight.  It would be perfect for dinner or a stroll on the beach.  This shirt will need to be ironed, it is not a wrinkle-free fabric."
2.0,"UPDATE: Original review below still applies. After a lot of messy work with spray foam, paint, orange Christmas lights, a mini fog machine (dont use extra foggy fog liquid! It‚Äôs too much for witch‚Äôs brew but perfect for a stadium concert;) cardboard, drill, etc, etc, my cauldron turned out pretty good (pictures don‚Äôt do it justice, unfortunately) This ended up being incredibly expensive in the end & I don‚Äôt know if I would do it again but I could not find a witch‚Äôs cauldron like the one I had in my head anywhere! So after looking on and off for a couple years and searching you tube this year I decided to make it. It‚Äôs close enough to what I envisioned. Next year I‚Äôm making a younger, prettier, but still scary life size witch. As you may guess I‚Äôm a bit obsessed with Halloween Witchesüòâ<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I like the size, it‚Äôs huge! But for $60 + $30 shipping, not including tax I expected much much better quality. The rim at the top is all jagged and has some very thin areas which screws up my original plan of hanging in from a tripod I was going to make to make it appear it was hanging above a fire. Don‚Äôt waste your money! Most people won‚Äôt want one this big anyways."
2.0,"this is TINY, it's for an 8 year old child, I have very small wrists and it barely fits. I would not recommend this for somebody who has normal wrists."
2.0,"For big feet, size 8 0r larger"
2.0,Cute but not true to size.i order a size m and it was to small.i take a size small in most things
2.0,It fits small. I bought for my daughter so I bought xs in other Disney night shirts and they were huge. Bought small in this and it‚Äôs like a leotard on my daughter.
2.0,The ends do not stay tight to the glasses. I would not invest in this type again.
2.0,RUNS REALLY REALLY small my 10 year old don't fit in it and she's a size 0
2.0,"Product came with bend in one of the lenses (like when looking at the reflection in the lens, you could see a type of dimple) as if maybe the lens wasn't set right in the frame (seemed like a thin plastic lens). Didn't want to mess with it so I returned it. So possible it was just a manufacturing defect, cheapie plastic lens, or a combination of. Case was nice and return was simple. I worked at a retail sunglass shop for a few years, so I can appreciate nice glass however too many have been sacrificed to the ocean gods for me to continue to sport and I have been pretty satisfied with cheaper shades. I understand these are a low tier (I don't expect any cheap pair to last), but the pair I received appeared to be sub par even for the low end category. Would not recommend. Gave an extra star cause easy return, so if you really like one of their colors, no sweat trying out for yourself."
2.0,These socks were way to small to wear as knee socks. We ended up cutting them and using as arm bands.
2.0,socks are very thin
2.0,Size up!!
2.0,Cute and good material but it's kind of short for me and I'm only 5'2&#34;
2.0,"I got this for my pre-teen daughter who can usually wear a child 12-14 leotard. This Capezio leotard seems to be made of nice thick material, however we couldn‚Äôt  make it work. It was way too tight! My daughter complained that it was cutting into her shoulders so we returned it. (Went with a Sansha leotard in a womens small and it fits so much better! )This girls XL capezio leotard would be perfect on a girl that wears a size 8-10 (which is normally a girls medium) Just a heads up on how small this leo runs."
2.0,i definitely ordered gray. I like the sweater but they sent the wrong color. This defeated the purpose of the purchase.
2.0,bottom of dress flares and the photo is not correct. cheap fabric
2.0,Not as long as shown in the picture.
2.0,It wasn't as pictured. It is smaller than what it looks in the photo and the material is cheap. Another Amazon write off. Bad purchase. I should've just went to Nordstrom Rack and bought something for that same price with better quality. Oh well. Lesson learned.
2.0,"The design is okay, but this is pretty much a muscle shirt henley, at least if you buy at the size recommended for your measurements. Very tight - as in, if you have abs, this is going to outline them. As others have said, definitely buy a size up.<br /><br />The material feels exceedingly cheap, almost like a cheap bag. Stretchy, thick, kind of coarse. I like the look of the shirt, but it is not the sort of thing I would buy if I was looking for a henley. This is going to be a return I think."
2.0,I hit this is broken fast to
2.0,Ordered the jacket + scarf and did not get scarf. The jacket is fine but I would have paid less for no scarf.
2.0,"The ""leather"" is peeling off already all over... so they look so cheap now. I hate it because he's only worn them twice and these were quite possibly my new favorite shoes of his until now. :( loved the squeaker"
2.0,"You get what you pay for with these boots. I ended up returning them. They were too small, and the leather quality was poor. The boots felt very thin. I did not think they would hold up very long with how much I wear boots."
2.0,"I'm busty and have full hips. I normally wear a 12. Loved the look of this dress, but am disappointed. I ordered a L and XL just in case. The fabric is a little stretchy so that's nice, but the L is too small in the chest and the XL is too big all the way around. The L didn't come with the belt, which is sewn on either side like a tie, not a regular belt. The fabric also seems like it'd fade pretty badly after the first wash."
2.0,"Should have listened, but was oh so hopeful. These are no use for larger breasts. I am a 38D and they did not hold for more than a minute at most before they began to peel off. Very disappointed."
2.0,I love the rings but the twisted one came shipped broke and the other is already loosing it‚Äôs color so it‚Äôs now turning my finger green‚Ä¶
2.0,"Not too impressed with the product. It fits pretty small and after running with it, it seemed to chafe on multiple spots on my legs."
2.0,Cloth is too thin
2.0,"I do not like the color of the material, it looks ordinary, I expected some better appearance and quality. I was disappointed."
2.0,"Looks really nice, but after several months, the inside of the band began to rust.  I've got a rash across my wrist from wearing it."
2.0,This dress is the same as the Just Quella version. Same manufacturer and everything. This dress runs a bit small. Material is kind of scratchy and a bit see thru. It wasn‚Äôt for me. The straight across neck wasn‚Äôt really flattering on me either.
2.0,Very small although cute design and nice color!
2.0,"So, this isn't a bra. It's some foam cups that sit in a pocket in the appropriate location. I really need some support while exercising and while these do the job, I don't think the foam cups are going to last more than two washes--which is 2 workouts as I sweat a lot and need to wash my workout clothes after each workout. Not recommended."
2.0,"The socks are completely different sizes and the Blue Hawaii print is too tight to fit my average size foot (women's 8 1/2).  The sock was so tight it was cutting off circulation.  You can see from the picture that the Blue Hawaii is smaller around and at least an inch shorter.  The stitching inside the sock does not allow it to stretch very far.  It it can't fit the average size women's shoe, it shouldn't be labeled as one size fits most."
2.0,It was much smaller than expected. Barely fits my wrist.
2.0,"The glasses looks good on unfortunately one of them broke it immediately as soon as I took it out for the package. Still wearing some of them, I‚Äôm on the fence."
2.0,"My wife really wanted to like this shirt, but the sleeves are painfully tight. It fit well in the chest area but she couldn't wait to take it off after 1 picture. It's lightweight and seems well made."
2.0,Loveeeee this necklace. But it broke after a wearing it twice. One of the strings fell off of the center circle.
2.0,"The color is very nice and the fabric is pleasant on the skin but what I received doesn't look like the picture. The chest was fit the belly area was larger, the design is square-ish, it didn't fit me well. The people at Zity are very helpful, customer service is excellent, and they go out of their way to give the customers a good experience. I wish I had a better experience of the product."
2.0,"Yes, this is a V-neck, but it may as well just be a crew. The neck hole is so small that it chokes you to wear this. I like these athletic v-necks as undershirts for work, but this will not do unless you wear a tie. Just bad design in my opinion."
2.0,"The top piece is an actual piece of string, not very sturdy.  Cute, but cheaply made (you get what you pay for)."
2.0,"These fit really strangely. It was tight around the waist but then super billowy/voluminous around the thighs, and then sort of tapered down towards the calves and it is just NOT flattering. The color is nice, and I wanted to like the style, it's just not cute. I'm returning them but annoyed that I have to pay postage - I obviously missed that there weren't free returns when I ordered this."
2.0,"I was able to wear this for about 2 days until it started to rust pretty bad..<br /><br />If you purchase this, don‚Äôt wear it in the shower.. or get any water on it! It that‚Äôs very easily."
2.0,"I wanted a good size, noticable earring, but these were ridiculously enormous. Like street walker on steroids."
2.0,Extremely tight. These are not made to fit adults. I couldn‚Äôt get them past my ankles.
2.0,it fits everywhere but around my thigh area it bubbles up by the buttons .
2.0,"These made the post of the earring thicker and it was stretching the hole in my ear causing a burning sensation, I am sure that someone else might be able to tolerate the stretching and burning, but after not wearing earrings for many years this just wasn't for me.<br />I didn't have a problem ordering from seller. And I received the correct product on time."
2.0,"I loved the color, and the cut. But it was too small with little to no stretch. :/"
2.0,"Pretty, but to small for any real ear"
2.0,"The belt is really cute. I really like the detail and the color, my issue is with the elastic. It was good for about 2 uses and then it started to stretch in funny ways. I would say if you are a size 6 or below it would be great. I am a size 8/10 and it was a little tight and the stretched elastic no longer looks pleasant to wear. It's a bummer because the buckle detail is great especially for a belt this inexpensive."
2.0,"Well one of the chains was broken when it arrived. I luckily have small tools for jewelry making and was able to add a new jump ring to it to connect it. It is cute, but very cheap. Also will turn colors on your skin. 2 stars only bc it's cute."
2.0,"The screw came out of the hinge, fell apart, lenses not very clear, extremely cheaply made, I should have known. It was cheap, and made in China.  I will fork out the money for a decent loupe."
2.0,"The shoe fit my foot and looked nice. However, the adjustable strap wouldn‚Äôt work  and was very flimsy. I was afraid if I forced it to adjust that it would break. It wouldn‚Äôt move when I tried to adjust it. I wasn‚Äôt able to wear it with my cosplay."
2.0,Ordered a size 5 recieved a size 7. It looks a million times better in the picture than real life.  I needed a cheap stand in for my wedding band for pictures while my it was being resized so I ordered this. It was too cheap. I should've just waited or paid more for a better quality ring.
2.0,I don't know who i should be venting my dissatifaction to the seller or the manufacturer. But you should really think about improving or completely redoing the glasp that locks and unlocks the belt. Since i purchase the belt months ago i've nearly had two accidents because i couldn't get the glasp undone or to go into the unopen position. This is very troubling for seniors like myself
2.0,These socks are way too tight. Sizing is way off.  Disappointed.  Cut circulation off. Left marks. I'm not heavy at all. I ware size 7 shoe size. Will say there made well. Gave 1 star fit terrible  2 star for made well.  üòêü§î
2.0,Not for girls with large breast. I was sad this didn‚Äôt fit because it was a cute dress
2.0,"I do not know why I bought this dress, I should have listened to the other reviews. The material, color, fit, and overall look of the dress are cheap and off the mark. I love the look of the dress as advertised, but the dress I received looks nothing like it!"
2.0,"The quality was not something I'd expect to see on $30 slippers, I would have expected it on a pair that cost $10 or less - to elaborate these slippers came in a cellophane bag with a plastic ring attaching the two feet together; you'd expect to see a big bin of them in a discount store. I found them to be way too narrow,  I wouldn't  be surprised if as the sizes got larger they just made the slippers longer but never wider.<br /> I later got something awesome from new balance for the same $30 and I'd advise anyone to do the same."
2.0,Bottoms are way too small yet if you order a size up the top is too big.  Returning both
2.0,the length shown in the picture is longer than what it actually is
2.0,"This had to be returned because they were actually shorts, not capris."
2.0,Bought these before a planned family rafting trip. They served their purpose except for the horrible petroleum smell they were emitting.
2.0,I ordered these for two things water proof and steel toe where's the steel toe and how does a zippered side keep out water
2.0,Runs extremely small. Ordered an XLarge & gave it to someone that wears a small (fit her fine).
2.0,Watch did not work when it arrived.  Replaced the battery for $7 for which I was not reimbursed.  Watch with fresh battery works so I have kept it rather than return it.
2.0,"I love what this company stands for.<br />Unfortunately The cut of the mask isn‚Äôt contoured enough to fit a face, it‚Äôs just basically a flat piece of cloth and falls off our kids faces (we‚Äôve never had that problem in any other kids masks before)."
2.0,The rubber piece that is used to adjust the mask fit fell off as soon as I put one on. Mask appears thick enough but is not comfortable and not what I expected.
2.0,Weird cut on bottom. Was too long for a midi and too short for a maxi.
2.0,Way too small. Bought as a gift and was too late to return
2.0,"Recommend sizing down. I ordered a large and it fit like an extra large, especially in the bodice area. Not meant for those with a small chest. I also couldn‚Äôt figure out what to do with the tie in the front. Would have been better without it. The print was nice, but material was just ok."
2.0,Lacks quality. I purchased two in different colors. I will keep one for pj's  but will be sending the other one back. I don't need MORE pj's!
2.0,"This dress gave me a diamond shape, with hips being the widest. This is not a flattering dress. I'm sending this back. The bottom guess smaller so you have to take smaller, awkward steps.<br />I gave this 2 starts b/c it came so fast. It is the size in US sizing that it says."
2.0,"These look great in the ad but in person they look much cheaper. They also feel very cheap. If you are going on vacay and don't want to bring glasses you care about I would get these. I won't feel bad when I eventually break or lose these. They also have warped and don't fit my face as tight as when I first got them (only a few weeks before). For the price, there are better quality brands and styles."
2.0,"I love how these glasses look, but the arm snapped off after only 2 months of wear. It would appear the arms are only attached by some kind of rubber cement or glue -- not meant to last, and for almost $90 it just isn't worth it to buy them again."
2.0,Unfortunately ours broke very quickly. Cute concept though.
2.0,Metal bridge is too sharp on the edges and cuts into my nose making it uncomfortable to even wear. Maybe it was a defective pair?
2.0,"this product is very small, more for a child."
2.0,I guess you get what you pay for...both chains broke within hours.
2.0,"Looked decent , but they were fake sunglasses with elastic rubber band rather than regular glasses arms"
2.0,I thought these flip flops would be softer. The hard sole makes them rigid and have no give to them.  You sound like a horse walking through the house.  They are very flat and uncomfortable.  I would not buy or recommend them to my friends again.
2.0,"Purchased these thinking they would be of a heavier material than most gaiters.  That was not the case.  The material actually seemed to be thinner than other gaiters I already owned.  Also, the draw string was of poor quality and broke immediately on one of the gaiters.  I ended up returning these.  That part was very easy to take care of."
2.0,Super short and tight everywhere
2.0,"I am 5'7 with a long torso and it comes up like mid stomach pretty much and shows hips. I am typically a large and purchased an extra large, it is baggy but also is way short, I could never wear this too work without a cardigan. If you have a small short torso it will work for sure and is cute. But taller people avoid this"
2.0,"This was one of the main things my daughter wanted for Christmas.  When I lifted it out of the box to check it out, it was broken.  Very disappointing, and it appears it is not available now."
2.0,"I though this would be more of acute flowy summer dress but I put it on and instantly hated it, no movement to it. It fits fine so no problem there. Just didnt have the vibe the picture gives off"
2.0,The silver work is very nice but the earrings are so tiny they would be the size for a child. I should have listened the the previous reviews.
2.0,"The color is not how it's pictured...def not HOT pink :(<br />Also didn't have the different size options, pic shows 4 and this necklace only had 2."
2.0,"This item worked well, until upon using it the third time, it just came apart where the red braided fabric joins the silver part. The rubber must be old or cheaply made. The needles feel sturdy. No problem there.<br /><br />I'll check the manufacturer on the package, in order NOT to purchase anything made by them, again.<br /><br />Having multiple balls in my household, I will be purchasing another one, just not by this manufacturer."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like the fit or yarn they were made off. Felt very corse
2.0,The medallion was fine and was accurately pictured on the website.  The chain was completely inadequate.  It was flimsy (at best) and it had NO clasp.  I moved the medallion to another chain that I already owned and have been wearing it daily.
2.0,Not as described.  Was out in 6 degree weather and my hands were freezing with these gloves
2.0,Very shirt through shoulders. Kid like fit.
2.0,Alot smaller than I imagined. Son liked it but I was disappointed.
2.0,came with a noticeable scratch on the left lens
2.0,"Fits well, but alot of loose strings and a missing button under the collar make me hesitant to order another."
2.0,Stones above emerald are too bright. Looks cheap.
2.0,Did not like the product name &#34;zeroUV&#34; on the outside of the glasses. The description or picture of the product I bought did not show it. It showed the picture without the product name on the outside of the legs of the glasses. Arrived promptly.
2.0,"The sleeves are HUGE!<br />The sweater fits like an XL for the most part (I normally wear L/XL) but the sleeves feel like they belong on a 3X... I could probably fit both of my arms in one and I don't have small arms.<br />I tried washing it hoping it would shrink but no luck.<br />I am wearing it for the first time today with the sleeves rolled up and I feel slouchy, will probably end up a pajama sweater unfortunately."
2.0,earrings are really too heavy to be worn comfortably.
2.0,"Not as pretty as the picture,very hard,a pain to use.üòü"
2.0,Bent pushing through a tie.
2.0,Bra was padded which I didn't know and don't want. This was a disappointment.
2.0,"I returned these. They looked interesting on the picture, but in person they look like a 2 dimensional joke.  It's almost like cutting out a piece of paper and wearing it for glasses, lol. They weren't for me."
2.0,"The dress is very pretty but size is way off. I normally wear a size 14. Based on the reviews, I ordered an xxl. When it arrived and I took it out of the box, I thought this looks like a size 10. I tried to put it on and it fit like a size 10. Arms definitely did not fit. Body sort of fit because it stretches a bit but way too tight. Either the dress was mislabeled or the sizes are way off. Disappointed that I have to return it."
2.0,"seriously, I should have found out in plain ol' American english just how small these measurement are.  I can't even find a reason to use these now.  I have to find SOMETHING to make the straps from, then find something small enough to use this on....a rubber band could probable take the place of using this tiny ""clasp"""
2.0,Runs small and very thin. I normally wear a medium but ordered a large and it was tight.
2.0,I really wanted to like these. They are cute and soft but they came with a rip in the back at the waist area so I didn't even get to wear them. Just shows that they are cheaply made and not worth $25. Will be returning.
2.0,The size was off by at least 2 sizes
2.0,too small butl-- it is a really cute hat for the money
2.0,I only got to wear these once. I was extremely careful and they still somehow ripped.
2.0,"Was a pretty blouse, they just run too small."
2.0,I'm sure that some tall willowy woman could pull this off and not look like she purposefully cut the holes in the top but I cannot. The color was great but the holes just looked silly on me.
2.0,"Liked the bag and roomy interior, just couldn't get past the smell.I returned it"
2.0,"Wanted to give this a one star rating but, the jeans were really cute and the material was nice. I ordered a two XX size and they didn't fit me. I only weigh about 170, I've never worn bigger than an XL but I decided to go bigger just in case for these. They came in the mail today and I was highly disappointed that they didn't even go past my butt. BIG GIRLS DO NOT BUY!?!?!?!?!"
2.0,Looks pretty but my chunky legged baby couldn't wear.  To tight and binding.
2.0,Love the earrings however I had to just buy a new one because the cuff on old one even though we haven‚Äôt even had it four months has started to break.
2.0,"These bras are not made of cotton, so my daughter feels itchy sometimes, if you are sensitive skin, you‚Äôd better skip buying these."
2.0,The robe bleeds color and stained my white sheets. Disappointing for a product that looks good otherwise.
2.0,One earring arrived completely bent. Beautiful packaging. There's no way it was damaged during shipment.  It was put in there damaged. Very displeased.
2.0,These glasses are uncomforbly small for an adult female
2.0,"These are cute but, one is bigger than the other.."
2.0,"i paid $19.99 when i first ordered it then a few weeks later it showed up in my browsing and was $7.99 with an extra 10% off, so i am upset i paid that much initially. also the pad inserts were creased/crinkled so i had to use my own pad inserts."
2.0,Runs small too tights for these curves.
2.0,Super cute but only got to wear it 3 times before it ripped. I would get another one but I'm not sure on how good the quality is.
2.0,"It was fine for about 3 weeks, but it keeps coming apart no matter how much I crimp the ring to the attachment."
2.0,It's a gross yellow color with this completely disconnected tan flutter panel across the front. Not flattering or really wearable.
2.0,"Didn't come as colored in the picture, and also has a white line when I wear it, don't like it.."
2.0,Super small gloves. Todler size.
2.0,I liked the back but the front fit very awkwardly on me. Almost like a boy short in the front.
2.0,Product seemed consistent with a Walmart type shirt and while it may be comfortable to some (hence the extra star) it didn‚Äôt seem like it was good of quality/breathable or cotton blend which was what it appeared to be.
2.0,"Very cheaply made. Pendant is ok, necklace is dollar store quality. This even broke after wearing it 3 times!"
2.0,This dress wasn't what it showed in the picture.
2.0,"Not cotton on inside, makes my face sweat.more and not breathable.cotton."
2.0,"Fits great and I love the blue and green colors, very vibrant.<br /><br />Updating this review, went from 5 starts to 2. Color bled on one of my shirts in the laundry, I wore it anyway thinking it was a freak accident and it stained my arms."
2.0,Great band but the finish started coming off after a week... now looks like poop
2.0,There was no button or zipper to close dress. Material felt cheap. I returned  it.
2.0,Way wider than shown. Cold air will go right up arm.  Returning.  No where nearly as nice as they look in the picture.
2.0,"I have had 3 very extensive back surgeries in the past 5 years.  My back Dr. suggested this product for me.  It feels good when I have it on, but I live alone and can  not get into or out of it.  Even with the zipper.  I tried it again today and caused a severe spasm in my upper back.  I will probably not be able to use it."
2.0,It broke! Immediately! Bummer. Maybe I can fix it?
2.0,"I agree with the other reviewers that the wide fit didn‚Äôt seem very wide at all. The wide would probably fit a normal width foot. Also, disappointed that the boots were slightly scuffed on the suede part and the leather had what I would call ‚Äúwear wrinkles.‚Äù The soles were clean but I have a feeling these were worn and returned. Sadly, I had to return these but the overall shape and design looked really cute."
2.0,Clear stones were missing when it arrived. Super bummed because it's really pretty and I was looking forward to wearing it.
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù 130lbs and ordered a small and it was a little too small
2.0,Breaks easily...but I guess you get what you pay for.
2.0,Tight... waiting for spring to wear.
2.0,Very disappointed.  The dimensions listed are NOT accurate.  Way smaller than it says.  Returning it.
2.0,Don't use the measurement chart they provide it is way off from being accurate
2.0,"I'm reviewing style #197. What's up with selling three distinct products on one product page? I give these one star for the mesh fabric and the colors, which I like. But I don't have much else good to say. I followed the instructions in the product description and ordered one size up from what I normally wear but they're still way too small. There is some variation in manufacturing too, so a couple of them are so small they feel like they're slicing the edge of my scrotum. Some of them are big enough to be barely wearable, but the pouch is so small it feels like I'm always on the verge of falling out. It turns my basket into a weird cone shape and it's so low-cut that it looks silly. Too bad I had to buy a package of 8 to find out that these aren't any good. Maybe you'll like them if you're a go-go dancer with shaved pubes. I was hoping for something wearable, comfortable, and supportive. I guess I should have known better than ordering a product that only has one dark underexposed photo of it being worn by a model."
2.0,"The earrings themselves are cute. HOWEVER. The material/design/build of the earrings are extremely poor/cheap. Almost every back I have had has fallen out and/or is loose. In a pack of 12, I think I only have about 6 full pairs left because they backs were so loose they fell out of my ear. And in most cases they fell out sometime during the day when I didn't even realize until the end of the night. Cute design, very poorly and cheaply made. It is unfortunate and I will not be buying from this brand again"
2.0,Clasp broke pretty sure I can fix it. .. but I'm not happy paid $40 it should be made better
2.0,The detail on the top of the ring is much smaller and poorer quality than it appears in this picture. I am very disappointed.
2.0,"If you truly need UPF protection this hat won't work.  The inside is not lined so your head  will not be protected.  The brim is nice and wide and will cover your face and neck.  It is a pretty color and  I wish I could use it, but it does not provide the protection I need."
2.0,My feet sweat real bad in these shoes. They fit fine but...
2.0,I am not satisfied with the shoes at all. Slippery soles and bad material
2.0,So clear they look like normal glasses.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture; very cheap...
2.0,The top is a little tight and the bottoms run very big. The material is nice and offered good support but the bottoms are too long. Awkward fit for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 142 lbs 36dd for reference.
2.0,"Sewing in the neck part is horrible, took it to the cleaners and they lady asked me how much did I pay for it because it was a horrible sewing job. Too long and too big."
2.0,the gold strap is wayyy too heavy
2.0,"The band works just ok. It clips onto the watch just fine, however, at least 6 times a day it pops off and falls off my wrist. It's an inexpensive option, but just doesn't work for me."
2.0,Cheap fabric that was kind of twisted and didn‚Äôt just lay right.  For the price I could have bought something better at Target. 2 stars because the color was accurate as the image
2.0,"They claim to be linen but they are a cotton/polyester blend. I'm living in a hot, muggy climate and polyester is the last thing I would buy. I am writing this because people need to know what this company is actually selling!"
2.0,Cute but very thin and see-through
2.0,Wasn't true to size. XXX was too sml and wasn't happy with it. Love the print but just couldn't use it.
2.0,Not mach to samsung watch 3.<br />tried with no success.
2.0,Very slippery! Hard to handle dishes. No way I‚Äôm using this as an oven mitt - I can feel the water temp through them. Not very useful over all.
2.0,"Pretty disappointed, I received these today, they may be good for a kid costume but not an adult pirate costume.  The picture lets you assume that they are silver like the clasp.  the clasp is a silver in color but the skull is a stamp picture on plastic..  I won't be wearing them..  A better description would had helped.."
2.0,too large (in the small) and poor sewing. returned.
2.0,The studs are fine. Most of the hoops are not really wearable..
2.0,"Liked the magenta pink and the fabric.  It would have been great to get out of the shower, however, for a Plus Size 3X it runs very small.  I'll be returning it."
2.0,"I dont like the way it fits, makes me look bigger than i am"
2.0,"This is an ok looking bracelet, 6.5&#34; is the perfect size for me. I dont like anything else about the purchase. I feel like it would be too much of a hassle to send it back to Hong Kong which I did not know before ordering. I think amazon should display an item's location on the product information page; very crucial to making a purchase. Basically I paid a lot more for what I got, I think for custom purposes it says on the outside package &#34;metal bracelet that's worth $50.&#34; No information was included in the packet as to what kind of metal; yeah I see the metal stamp (which is very hard to read) but not even the receipt was included in the packet."
2.0,"Cheaply made, low quality Chinese product."
2.0,"No shape, I‚Äôll for"
2.0,I wear a size 6 to 8 and product said they run small so I ordered a large which was a 10 - 12 and they are still way too small they look like they are a<br />childs or at least a junior size.
2.0,It's huge. You'd have to have a gigantic head for this to fit.
2.0,Runs smaller than advertised
2.0,I really like the look of this bag and it's roomy!  But the smell!!!  It has a very strong gasoline smell.  I left it draped over a chair for a few days to &#34;air out&#34; and no improvement.  I decided to chance it and wash it with heavily scented fabric softener.  A slight improvement but I'm not sure I'll even be able to use it.  It is cute so I'm going to try to tackle the smell a bit longer before I return.  I'll update if I was successful.
2.0,Nice concept but didn't like the dress at all. The arms of the dress were super tight but the rest of the dress fit fine. I'm 5'0 so the dress did not fit me like it fit the model in the picture and the caged pattern on the back was very lose  (I purchased a large). The material is SUPER HOT and not hot like sexy I mean hot like a Texas summer day but leaves your back freezing cold. I'll probably give this dress away. It was a great price and would probably look better on a taller person.
2.0,It's too large and lacks shape.
2.0,"I like the color! The bar just seems really long and the bottom jewel is so uncomfortable, I think partially because the bar is so long! The prongs, top and bottom, were really irritating to me too. I think if your piercing is longer, it would be fine. For me, the bottom one was outside of my belly button, and pushed against my skin."
2.0,Not true to size. When order size up.
2.0,It stretches but it‚Äôll stay stretched and the material is really heavy so if you live in Texas like me you can wear this shirt and not die from a heat stroke maybe two months out the year but hey if it‚Äôs cold where you live you‚Äôll be okay lol it‚Äôs cute just not as cute as the model wears it though. It‚Äôs more like a gift for your granny on her birthday or Christmas type shirt
2.0,Weeny socks with no bulk to them.  might be perfect with dress shoes with dark socks.  just not want he needed for work socks.  all cotton great but not enough of it.
2.0,Broke second day.
2.0,"I am a 6'3"" man and this turtleneck comes just too the top of my jeans.  Would never be able to tuck it in, and would look quite ridiculous out, so I'm not sure what I will do with it."
2.0,Too tight across the calves.  People with muscular calves (like dancers) will find these too tight.  Gave them away to a thin colleague.
2.0,One of the coin like dagle was detached while i got this. It might be easily fixable but i have open the package for that which I didn't intend to. Since it was a gift. Otherwise it looks pretty.
2.0,Ran very small- unwearable
2.0,"Very small, looked pulled and not as draped or flowy - would go up several sizes on this one."
2.0,These run small. And the plastic ends to the drawstring tie fell off before I could wear them. These don't seem very high quality.
2.0,"The excess band holder has broken already.  Chalking it up to, getting what you pay for."
2.0,"The mask material is not soft or breathable, hurts my ears too."
2.0,Haven't worn it yet.  But it came intact and looks very nice.  It is smaller than the picture depicted.
2.0,Item should be in sizing not age group since body types are different.
2.0,"Not even close enough what shown on the pictures, just one wash (hand wash) color faded ."
2.0,These sunglasses are kind of ugly did too dark and also too big for my face you can barely see out of them you get what you pay for for the price I could have gotten some flea market glasses and did better
2.0,I like the watch but the day and date don't work
2.0,doesn't look like photo sadly. Top doesn't look like it and sleeves are loose past elbows and shorts are spandex not like photo. Disappointed.
2.0,Chinese sizes. Their XL is our small or medium. Don't trust the sizes they give you even if it is in the US format. I bought a size 11 and it fits someone who is size 8-9
2.0,"Very pretty ring but it broke already, too thin, bends easily."
2.0,"Slippers were very nice at first, of course‚Ä¶ but they are slippers, this item is what will have the most wear especially coming from me (pregnant, lounging around lady lol). The ‚Äúsole‚Äù pretty much diminished and it felt like I was walking barefoot. It‚Äôs a very cute style but just didn‚Äôt last, and I did expect that, so‚Ä¶ btw, I ordered my exact size and it widened A LOT."
2.0,Just not in love with the style.
2.0,"The buckle does not lock in place, so it constantly slips"
2.0,"I requested SMALL, and came like xxl ??  With No Size Tag."
2.0,"Son wore the new aqua shoe and didn't walk with it for 10 minutes before having blisters in the back of both his heels; he could barely walk with them. He wore them for two days to see if they would change- Will give it another try in a few days when his current blisters heal.<br />Otherwise, the size was perfect"
2.0,Found that the music volume needs to be cranked or receiver needs to be close to sound source.<br /><br />Need to see if wiring is copper and if so may try to extend receiver to reach a pocket for how I would like to use it.
2.0,I bought this for a Halloween party costume. The shirt was exact fit. Material was nice.  The corset was darker pink than shown in the picture. And the claps kept coming undone. I ordered the 6x. I am us size 18-20. The corset for perfect around my waist but the busy was too large for my double d.  I am returning this outfit.
2.0,"Don't be sucked in by the picture - this is one ugly, cheap-looking shirt when you actually get it, but too much of a pain to return, so you'll end up keeping it, but never wearing it."
2.0,I paid $30 for this. With sewing errors it is definitely not worth it.
2.0,"Disappointed. Very, very small.<br />Very nice size for a child."
2.0,"The tie was smaller than I thought. It also has a plastic holder in the back for the second flap behind the tie, its not the real cloth material."
2.0,"Same product was bought from the same vendor but two different Packages received bought size 9 which everything was great.  size 5/6 too small, UV key was rectangular according to the photo it should have been an oval type key,light sucked, did not work for the shirt!<br />size 6 seemed like the nock off version. For the 25 bucks I would have expected the same quality for both but unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt the case."
2.0,Very small. Too lightweight . Looks cheap.
2.0,I've gotten free tshirts softer than this one. The material is very scratchy. I got a medium and normally wear a medium and believe this item to be true to size. The print is cute but looks smaller and higher up in the example photo. I am returning it.
2.0,Bought for my son to wear at Schlitterbahn. Before the end of the day the toes were all frayed. Poor quality.
2.0,"Only use for shower shoes at the gym. Very hard plastic. Difficult to slip on as there seems to be no give. Though they may be good for summer wear, but not so. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"This ear cuff was certainly as represented in the photo, but the stone isn't visible when the cuff is on the ear--it's behind the ear. Pretty piece of jewelry with intricate design, but now I know not to get an earcuff with a stone."
2.0,fit very small
2.0,"According to the measurements i ordered  xxl ,im usually size l/xl and it still runs supper small the dress. I cant close the zipper and the color is not what it shows in the pictures. Not worth the money."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:a073ced5e135345cff95485459f3de7d]] NOT GOOD QUALITY!!! First it took 1 month and a half to arrived (i paid the fast shipping for nothing), second it came BROKEN! The keychain came broken, i also didn't like the colors, it looks so pale. And Third, it doesn't look like the picture, the face is flat (not puffy) anyways i just didn't like it. I have to look where else i can buy it."
2.0,Refer to above
2.0,It was nice but way too small<br />I got a M. 120 lbs!
2.0,"Was not too crazy about this top. The concept is nice but I dint like that the material felt a little cheap and see through. Its not like the regular polyester type shirts and it has some cotton which makes it seem through, something that you would probably wear 2 or 3 times and then toss. i ended up returning."
2.0,"Great idea! But sadly what arrives is substandard.<br /><br />The gift box that it arrives in came blemished, torn and adorned with a ""made in china"" sticker plastered on it. And that's just the outside.<br /><br />The printed 'card' is NOT what, or how, it appears in the sales photos. It's effectively a square business card: gloss printed on 16pt card stock. The neckless resides all jumbled up in a small ziplock plastic bag. There is little chance that one can recreate the effect of the dangling necklace within the gift box and have it hold in place.<br /><br />A FANTASTIC gift idea that has been very poorly implemented -- sad, sad, sad as I was really counting on this for Valentines day."
2.0,This dress is cute but thin as paper and is not true to size !
2.0,This suit fit very small the cups were extremely low and not high enough to support anything. Also the under wire was poking out.  I returned very displeased...colors were beautiful though.
2.0,Finish didn't last 2 weeks
2.0,"This dress is shorter than pictured, but is true to size."
2.0,This socks  keep my feet somewhat warm and dry but not as warm as I had expected.  The 35 degree name is misleading to the customer.  I definitely would not wear these socks at 35 degrees below Fahrenheit .
2.0,Was hoping it would be a little more pink but got over that. What I did not like was the first time I wore it a tassel fell off somewhere. Now I could see perhaps if I was out dancing or something but I wore it to work. Don't waste your money.
2.0,Wayyy to big. Order at least a size under what you wear
2.0,Good quality but Don‚Äôt ring
2.0,"It's okay, has a dumb pocket but just okay"
2.0,To small and didn't look anything like the picture. Do not buy for adult more like a child's jewelry.
2.0,Came smaller than I was expecting and I bought a size up. I would recommend H&M for future romper purchases.
2.0,I brought this dress in a 4X. I am a 3X and brought a 4X because the sizing maybe a bit off. The sizing is way off. This dress feels like a 1X.
2.0,Chain is too short.
2.0,Yellow lenses are not polarized.
2.0,The chain fell off right away.
2.0,"I have a lot of sunglasses and most of them are cheap. I loved these, but these broke within 2 months of having. These definitely weren't worth the price to me because they broke SO fast. I wish they broke within the first 30 days so I could get my money back."
2.0,"I loved this cardigan when i wore it first, it fit perfectly. But on inspection saw big gaping holes in both the under arm areas. Was really disappointed. Had to return it."
2.0,I got the burnt orangeish color and it was too big but I still like them (no belt loops) then got the off whitish color in a size smaller (had belt loops) but was extremely too small. Same with black‚Ä¶. So obviously it‚Äôs inconsistent
2.0,Even after you wash it it leaves black smudges on your face
2.0,Its not white as seen on the picture. Its silver. Its somewhat stretchy.
2.0,"The style of the skirt is nice. However, the material is soooo thin and almost see-through. Its like the type of material that you would make pajamas out of. Its soft and nice just not for a skirt. Unless, you are wearing it over top of leggings or tights, don't waste your time."
2.0,Clasp on suspenders broke after a couple wears.
2.0,"Order twice, both times not happy with the fit. Order large. Both time the jacket was to small."
2.0,"Loved the look of these, and could tell they were well made.  When clipped on the ear, they were too heavy and looked funny.  Had to return them."
2.0,"I wanted control top underwear that didn‚Äôt give me panty lines if I wore something on the tight side or an unforgiving fabric (some sundresses I planned to wear on vacation). These seemed like the perfect alternative, but I wound up not using them at all on my trip. Putting them on it seems they‚Äôre sturdy and pulled you in, but it doesn‚Äôt look good if you‚Äôre not perfectly flat like the model in the pictures. If you have a belly, these stay up only if you‚Äôre standing up and don‚Äôt move at all. One step, boom, they roll  down, and any midsection chub overflows and suddenly you have the worst muffin top ever. Not a fan, but I‚Äôm sure if I had the model‚Äôs body it would be fine."
2.0,"I purchased this wallet in summer of 2017 and loved it.  It was everything I needed, and slim.  Fast forward a year later, and the wallet was falling apart everywhere and couldn't hold anything without it falling out.  I attributed it to normal wear and tear and purchased the same wallet in August of 2018 -- The second one didn't last nearly as long as the first, as it's already destroyed and falling apart in the same areas as the first, possibly worse.  I wouldn't purchase it for a third time..."
2.0,Momma taught me if I didn‚Äôt have any nice to say don‚Äôt say anything at all.
2.0,"I purchased these because I ordered a different pair and liked them a lot. However, when I opened these ones, one is much longer and wider then the other. :/"
2.0,Runs really small. And not as long as it seems in picture.
2.0,"For the price, this was a cheap-looking piece"
2.0,Holes in pockets and rips alond side one zipper - after apprx 1 month of use.  Very poor quality
2.0,"The dress is very cute, but the off shoulder is uncomfortable and twists as soon as you move your arms. Wish i knew where it was made, before the purchase. I looked for that info but was not able to find it :("
2.0,"Finish started spotting off within a month.  Yeah it‚Äôs only $6, but that‚Äôs no deal if it only lasts a month.  If it it was more durable, it would have gotten 5 stars."
2.0,Runs small and fabric isn‚Äôt very soft or stretchy. Kinda stiff feeling.
2.0,Band is a lot thinner than you think - feels very flimsy
2.0,extremly small.
2.0,Work only for 4 weeks and now is giving me problem... I'm disappointed
2.0,These are hard to get on.  But the biggest<br />Problem is that they are toooo long!
2.0,I ordered an XL warmgrey and it fit me a little snug. But my main problem is that the cardigan i received appears to have a sickly yellowish tint to it that is not shown in the images provided. I attempted to contact the seller twice to discuss these issues and a week later still have not got a reply. I considered ordering a different one but if the color is that off; im not going to risk the hassle of a second misrepresented color. But i will be going to the UPS store in the morning to return this item. I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The good points for anyone whos interested are that the style is good. The fabric is very very warm for being so thin. Its also a little bit stretchy so factor that in when sizing.
2.0,It will make your neck itch..!!!
2.0,"This hat came up on a search for ""hemp hat"". The item description has the word HEMP in it, clear as day. There is no indication on either the packaging or the hat itself that indicates this is made with hemp. Why lie? The hat has a great look, hence the additional star I tacked on even though the seller is acting without integrity or honesty by lying about the fabric composition."
2.0,"If it were a loop, it would be one piece that attaches to the watch at both ends. This band consists of 2 pieces and it‚Äôs hard to attach to the wrist."
2.0,was a lot heavier than i thought it would be
2.0,Order a size up. Tight in arms.
2.0,Broke after first week...I can get it repaired...but will cost more than the necklace itself....but...my grandson LOVED wearing it!
2.0,The top and bottom are not proportioned well.
2.0,The zipper is sewn only half way across the bag.
2.0,"I ordered 4 sets. There's not a single strand of cotton in any of them, but they look cute. The sizes fit us all (we're on the skinny side though) even for length which usually is an issue. So I figured they'll be ok for a few nights.<br /> I went on to give them a quick, cold wash (as I do with all the new garments). All the white became grey. I don't think we'll be using them another season."
2.0,"Love the style, but the sunglasses arrived stretched out"
2.0,These arrived dirty like they had been worn. One was also stretched out.<br />Amazon returns are awesome though!
2.0,"Didn‚Äôt work for us. Back doesn‚Äôt come down far enough on skull; it doesn‚Äôt stay on securely. Couldn‚Äôt wear for the purpose purchased. Also, the brim is short. Was hoping for a longer brim and cap that covers back of head sufficiently to remain on head securely."
2.0,"The nose pad broke off on the first day of use. I like them, but for the price, they shouldn't be that flimsy."
2.0,Not as thick as I expected.  Would not purchase again.
2.0,Far too heavy for a think watch.
2.0,"18-24 months was maybe big enough for a new born, or an American Girl Doll. Not quite like the picture, the tulle was thin and the material was cheap. It is cheap but I‚Äôve paid less and gotten better quality."
2.0,"I bought the f-navy shirt, it fits great but half of the white flowers turned blue after one wash."
2.0,These slippers are very narrow and for a size 9 are tight.<br />I don't wear a wide shoe and don't know if going up one size would help.<br />Not very comfortable and had to send them back.<br />Not worth the price.
2.0,"The actual necklace looks nothing at all like the picture advertised. It is smaller with smaller links in the chain. I was looking for a bulky. chunky necklacce, and this was definitley not it. I'm pretty disapointed because the picture looked perfect. However, the necklace I got wasn't bad, it was just not what I was looking for. When you hold it in your hand, it feels so much lighter than it looks like it should be. the good thing is that it looks like it should be heavy and expensive. If you want this necklace, base it off of what I said, not on the pictures, or you will be disapointed."
2.0,"I have a couple of versions of this kind of popcorn fabric sweater. This one is pretty bad. It is very thin and overly stretchy so after an hour you get a misshapen, threadbare mess. For the price, I usually would not be picky (this was a lightning deal) but I wouldn't wear it if you paid me. It went back and I bought it from another brand and am happy."
2.0,They were a little small for my legs.
2.0,"This dress was a disappointment. It hangs on me like on a hanger. The neckline is too high and the bust is baggy. I have the same build as the model, but the cut is all wrong on me."
2.0,These are comfortable enough and the waistband is great- but where they stretch the fabric fades and stretches since the material is thin. I am returning them.
2.0,When i got this product.I was disappointed .It's not as pretty as the picture.
2.0,"had to return it, bottom fits well, top is too tight and i really didn't like the material...way too heavy for summer!"
2.0,Runs really small had to return my roper. I wish there were larger sizes.
2.0,An odd design to say the least. But it‚Äôs holding up. Worth the price but clunky.
2.0,The cups inside the sports bra are smaller than it appears they should.
2.0,This is made for a short body not an average length body. It's so cute too bad it's too small.
2.0,See through!!
2.0,"Super cute on. Material is not soft, more on the itchy side."
2.0,"Really like them, quality is similar to my more expensive blenders. HOWEVER mine came almost un-usably scratched pretty badly in the direct center of vision on my left eye.  Super annoying, wouldn't buy this brand again"
2.0,Should have looked closer at description. Glass Pearl
2.0,"Bag came in and i was Super excited! When i opened It, i was Underwhelmed to say the least. I gave It a 2 star because the size was exactly what i wanted, but it just didn‚Äôt look like something that‚Äôs going to hold up for long. The material looked very cheap and i didnt Like that."
2.0,Has a high arch support.... so if you have a lower arch it will be uncomfortable.... my arch is just on the verge of being to low but hoping it will become more comfortable after a few times being worn<br /><br />Revised: frustrating the Velcro doesn‚Äôt hold... my foot is getting use too the high arch but the Velcro fasteners don‚Äôt hold
2.0,What a waste of money. I accidentally threw it in the dryer and it shrunk 7 sizes! Going Into the trash
2.0,After the first wash it started looking like I've washed it several times. It already looks old. Looks like I had it for years.
2.0,When I received this product the other day I replaced them with the original black bands that came with my watch. I loved the vibrant red color but could notice right away that it was a different rubber than the original ones. They were easy to put on the watch but not so easy taking them off. I had a very hard time taking these bands off my watch. They only came in one size so the band's were way to big for my wrist.
2.0,I like the shirt but dark green is not the same in person has a lot of white with emerald green I would say more white and less green.
2.0,The don‚Äôt fit my glasses as expected. Hard to get smudges off. They seem low quality.
2.0,Within a week the bolts came on screwed and the keys fell everywhere. Back to a standard keychain for me
2.0,These keychains were so cute but sadly fell apart so quick. My keys fell off the chain and thank goodness it happened at home and not somewhere that I could‚Äôve lost them.
2.0,Very cute but not true to size.  Also not a great quality.
2.0,Merchandise doesn't look like picture
2.0,I don't recommend very bad quality
2.0,Much smaller than expected! Very flimsy and have only used it once.
2.0,"love the neck line but makes me look very hippy, the sides are too long for my 5 ft frame"
2.0,I couldn't read the time on this watch and had to send it back.  The face is both too small and poorly designed.  Too bad because the band is very nice.
2.0,I ordered a light blue color pair of pants and I didn't get them üò° I like pants I do have but not happy about the color.
2.0,I COULD NOT WEAR IT IT WAS NOT SIZED CORRECTLYNICE LOOKING PRODUCT GAVE AWAY
2.0,"They may look sexy, but it‚Äôs wedgie central all day."
2.0,Purchased these for my son to review before the next marching season.  He used them once and the seams began to come undone.  They are now in a pile with the other gloves he has tried and discounted.
2.0,"Made me look fat at. No flattering at all. The floofy swing bottom is too much fabric and sticks out too much. Had to return unfortunately. Other than that, it was nicely made. Thick, warm almost sweaterlike, without the bulkiness. Just not for me."
2.0,"Unfortunately, this wallet just doesn‚Äôt hold up. I like the look and minimalism, though. I loaded it up just enough to keep everything from falling out, so I didn‚Äôt overstuff or otherwise stress it. My belt from this manufacturer is also not terribly durable."
2.0,Cute top but fit??? Ordered a 3X. Its more like a medium.
2.0,"Nice for the beach, but the tassels fall off way too easily.  I wore it for about 6 hours and the strings were everywhere."
2.0,"In the past I've been pleased with Popana products, but this top is the exception. I ordered a size up to be certain the length would be adequate. I'm 5'5&#34; and it is way shorter than described. It is advertised as being 30 inches long, but it doesn't even come close. I purchased this in eggplant. The color is as displayed.Though the workmanship is not great, it's what you'd expect for the price. Other than the length the fit is as shown on the model. The fabric is soft and flows well. I will probably be returning due to the discrepancy in length."
2.0,"Purchased for my wife, her review:<br />Blah. The first adjective that comes to mind about this dress. I have several similar styles, and thought, a short sleeve in red would be a nice addition. That was so wrong. The material is lackluster. It‚Äôs a cheap t shirt material. The side slits are extremely high, that any wrong movement or wind gust will expose anything you have on underneath. The pockets are at an odd position to be functional, and protrude weirdly.<br />The best this garnet could be used for is a quick cover up for the beach or pool. Other than that, I wouldn‚Äôt waste my money."
2.0,"This was way too boxy and unflattering, it also came wrinkled and looked like it would be hard to keep from creasing and wrinkling with normal wear and wash. I returned it"
2.0,"Maybe I just didn't understand how to wear it properly, but both times I tried to use this, it did NOT give me enough support at all."
2.0,Came with a couple stains on it. I hope they come off in the wash
2.0,To tight and not flattering...
2.0,"Bought this in black and yellow, both size L. Black is perfect, yellow is so long that it‚Äôs unwearable and I‚Äôm returning it. Sloppy work.  Cheapy fabric, very polyester. It‚Äôs cute though. We‚Äôll see if the black skirt holds up..."
2.0,"It's adorable!!! Sadly, it only lasted me 3 days. I bought this about a month ago and it broke within those first 3 days. I've since put it in a bag and kind of forgot about it. I'm going to try to glue the diamond links back together when I have a chance. I didnt bother contacting seller cause I kind of forgot and also don't really want to deal with the hassle. I'm probably going to get the bigger diamond band and hopefully that should be sturdier than the tiny diamond links that this band has."
2.0,Too large and too long. I'm 5-2 and 135 pounds reviews guided me to large. I'm sending them back. They seem kinda flimsy too
2.0,Size was to small width wise. Sent item back. Did not like the feel of the material either. Looked cheaply made
2.0,This is VERY small. The thickest part of my waist/hips is a 37'. I can barely buckle this.
2.0,To me the price matches the quality. I was surprised at the deal I found the shirts with but understood why when they arrived. A point that had little bearing on my rating but worth noting if any has a similar experienced; the shirt smelled terrible when it arrived. Reminded me of a fish tank that hadn't been cleaned in awhile. But the shirts felt very cheap and I was underwhelmed by the quality of the material.
2.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): These socks are weirdly tight across the ankle area, and just small overall in general.  I wear a size 7.5-8 in shoes and have never had a pair of women's socks fit this oddly tight.  I tried on multiple pairs in the pack and they are all too tight, so it wasn't just a fluke on the first pair.  I'm sure they would get even tighter after washing.<br /><br />The socks are somewhere between thin and medium thickness; definitely not a thick sock as you would expect of a winter sock.  I do like the colorful patterns on the socks."
2.0,turned dark in one week of wear
2.0,Runs small.  Just barely fit.  Very sparkly.  I didn't really like it because the way the stones are set up they look like Mickey mouse.  Hard to explain but when you see it you will see the Mickey ears.  Even my husband thought it was a little girls Mickey bracelet.
2.0,Cheap looking and terrible gift box<br /><br />Very unhappy
2.0,Very Cheap. The elastic is very weak. Too expensive for the value
2.0,"You get what you pay for, too cheap looking for my taste and won't sit down properly on the collarbone area."
2.0,Runs small. All skin is pushed out. Not appealing.
2.0,Way too long for me. I'm a 5'4&#34; inch woman. I'll need to improvise something to make it work.
2.0,They're cute but I wish they didn't have finger prints all over them. Smooth them out - people will appreciate it. Trust.
2.0,Pic nice but real it's not gd so chip
2.0,"The gold coating wore off after a couple weeks... very pretty, but just not good quality."
2.0,Looked better on websire. Was more like a moo moo
2.0,Not too elastic and flexible. Very heavy and bulky for my wrist.<br />Suitable for big wrist guys. Quality OK. Not worn enough to recommend this product at this time.
2.0,"Too short, I'm 5'3"" and it went above my knees, but the material and design was great, too bad it was not long, disappointed."
2.0,"I was so excited for this nose ring, but the guage is way too big. I have studs and rings that are 22 guage and this was too big to fit through my nose. My advice is make sure to know what size guage you need before purchasing any body jewelry you buy online."
2.0,they are to costumey and way to big
2.0,"I was first sent just one earring, so sent that back. Then had to pay another $2 more when I reordered and what I received this time was two earrings but they are not a pair! They both leap the same way instead of a proper pair which should either leap into one another or away from each other as in the photo above. Mine either both leap to the left or right which looks very odd. So I would say that they are a waste of money and don't buy them!"
2.0,Just received these today and they look nothing like the picture.  They do fit the frame well but is the only thing right.  In the picture they look like a dark mirror finish but that is not at all the way they are at all. They have a blueish tint but are not very dark and you can even see your eyes through them even so barely block the sun. Returning them immediately.
2.0,"Honestly, I was so disappointed with this dress. The stitches were coming out immediately before I even put it on. Crappy craftsmanship. I'm not returning it as I can fix it myself, but I was really not pleased."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:ccf80652cf3670f2923da5449bc2235]] The jumper doesn‚Äôt  look like the picture. I thought it was actually jean material and it‚Äôs not, it just has the jean look. It was cute on me though."
2.0,"They are definitely not like what they advertised. They are cheaply made, but I guess they are okay for that price. Just look at my picture and you will see."
2.0,"Worked well for a few months, but the winder lock got stuck so the spring wouldn't hold any energy."
2.0,I actually returned this item. It seemed flimsy and I wasn't going to risk having broken luggage when traveling alone.
2.0,"After a week I lost the keys, the product is not safe enough"
2.0,"Cool hat, but it fits like those hats that the old vets wear.  It sits on your head with at least 1&#34; between the top of your head and the lid,  The bill is already formed as well"
2.0,Too difficult to &#34;get it locked down.  Had to finally tie it off.
2.0,I gave it 2 stars because I did like the heaviness and shine of the bracelet; however the first time I wore it. It got 3 separate kinks in it!  Now I can't wear it anymore.  What a waste of money!!  Don't trust this vendor again...guess you DO get what you pay for!!?!
2.0,Very light weight material. Sizing conversion too large
2.0,I ordered blue and received green. It is a good size pouch and nice for the money. But won't be using it because I wanted blue to match my purse.
2.0,Fits tight around mouth
2.0,"Fell apart within two weeks of first using it. Maybe okay if you just put some light gym clothes in it, but if you put anything too heavy like your shoes/phone/tablet, the bag rips and the straps come loose/the grommets break off. Very disappointing."
2.0,poor quality You get what you pay for
2.0,"This is claimed to be a one size fits all but it is not, fits very snug in mid section and thigh area, top of cover up was perfect"
2.0,Looks like prison garb
2.0,"I ordered the bottoms labeled as ""Red"" because the image makes them appear to be a bright neon red or fuchsia. They arrived today and although I'm thrilled with the cut and style, they are most certainly primary red. Kinda bummed. So beware, trust the label not the pic."
2.0,"This item should be $5, not $15. They look like a craft project that someone made out of felt, super glue and a head band."
2.0,It's waaaaay too big and the colors are muted to where it looks faded
2.0,The first time I wore this the zipper broke.
2.0,Fabric doesn't shimmer as shown in picture.
2.0,"These are very sun proof glasses, Great. The only problem was the nose mount part of the frames has a thin plastic line where the MOLD of the frames were made. Their is a thin line ridge of the plastic which hurts the top of your nose after several minutes of wearing. I was gonna sand down that part to see about a better fit. But have not yet."
2.0,"Really nice, but it broke within the first hour he had it on.  The top little astrological button just popped off.  Hasn't worn it since."
2.0,Goggles fit well but  depth perception is off
2.0,Bought this as a thank you gift for my daughters art teacher thinking it would fit him.  Product description says it‚Äôll fit male wrist but unless he has a super thin wrist this won‚Äôt fit.<br />It‚Äôs a cute little bracelet for the art lover.  I just wish they came in different sizes.  Not sure if I‚Äôll return it or just let my teenage daughter have it. Bummer !
2.0,"Shame on me for not measuring deck before ordering this product.  Umbrella base is way to big for the deck.  I requested to return umbrella to the company that hasn‚Äôt even been out of the box.  They granted me permission to return but I have to pay the postage .....  more then likely,  postage will be more then what the umbrella cost !  I have never had to pay postage on anything that I had to return in the past, which isn‚Äôt much. Shame on me for not measuring deck before ordering this product.

2.0,"I'm a watch guy and have a lot of Seiko's, which I would give five stars.  But unfortunately two of my Seiko solars developed weak power storage.  Even after charge in sunlight, they couldn't run a few days.  With the first one I was rebuffed by Seiko because the dealer I bought it from wasn't on their authorized list.  That dealer gave me the name of the authorized dealer that he bought if from, but Seiko still wouldn't stand behind it.  During the arguments the watch traveled back and forth to Seiko Japan twice.  Eventually, after very expensive freight charges, they agreed to fix it.  But a few months later it developed the same problem.  That's two tries and two failures.<br /><br />Soon after that another Seiko solar, this one, developed the same problem.  That totals three tries and three strikes.  I sadly tossed both in the trash.  More than $1,000 wasted.  There was no question that these were genuine Seiko, but they wouldn't back them.  If the company I work for receives a failed return, we thank the customer for taking the time to send it back and shoot him a replacement instantly.  It doesn't matter where they bought it.<br /><br />I'll continue to buy Seiko watches.  But their track record on solar watches is awful."
2.0,Disappointed because the frame of the earring is so cheap looking. The stones themselves are lovely.
2.0,Not exactly as shown in picture.
2.0,I ordered this charm. It is so small that you cannot even read the wording in the charm
2.0,"**REVIEW UPDATE**<br />I removed three stars! See photos. These are really cute, but after wearing them I noticed the toe seam is different on one shoe. On the right one,  seam lays down, on the other it stands up. They both need to do same thing. Very disappointed in this cuz it looks wonky. I bought these using prime and am thinking I'll return them. Quality control needs to catch these kind of things.<br /><br />**ORIGINAL REVIEW**<br />A different look than i'm accustomed to. But I really like them. They are comfortable and appear to be well made."
2.0,"If your kid is even remotely hard on shoes, do not buy this shoe. My daughter wore these shoes literally ONE TIME and the bow on the end broke off  and the toe tip of the shoes are so scratched and scuffed that the black coating is pealing off. She can probably wear them one more time if I do some serious doctoring to the shoes before hand. They are simply cheaply made and not worth the money."
2.0,"It broke after two days, so upsetting."
2.0,Very pretty but way to big
2.0,The band itself is great. The clasp holds well. The downside is that it has snagged/ruined my tops. :(
2.0,Nice bracelet but had to send back because it came with a broken clasp.
2.0,It is very ill fitting and does not leave a lot of room in the bust area.
2.0,"These are hearts, not dots! Unfortunately, on a smartphone, which is what I use when ordering, you can't see this! A cute dress for a teenager, but at 66, although I look pretty young for my age, not young enough for hearts! I was out of town with my son and travel was greatly discouraged when I placed my order, so by the time I could travel back home & open my packages, it was too late for a return. I am VERY UNHAPPY as I will NEVER wear it!"
2.0,"Order up a few sizes! This was tight and fit more like a shirt and not a dress at all. Very pretty colors though, I just wish it would have been true to size."
2.0,"The brim is not stiff all the way around the hat. The material on the back of the hat just hangs on your neck and is very irritating. The fabric is useful for the pool, as it dries quickly, but I was disappointed in the product as a sun hat for walking/gardening (which is what I needed most). The hat also fit somewhat small."
2.0,I love the design on it and the picture is deceiving because the shoulder part does not stay on it's like it elastik thing that just if you're not moving your arms.. it will stay put but the second you walk it'll pop up on one side like a papa wheelie just a weird fit
2.0,"I bought two toddler size hats from this listing, one in marked dk brown/sandstone, and one in plum caspia. They came both labeled as toddler but totally different sizes. Plum fits as expected, though seems a little rough compared to other carhartt hats I own. The marked dk brown is long like a sock and narrow, with minimal stretch. Totally different dimensions than the plum and will have to be returned."
2.0,This dress is not large enough in the chest area if you are bigger than a c cup. Sad the dress didn't fit.
2.0,No m gust√≥ se le cae las piedrecitas s√≥lo d sacarlo adem√°s no Leda bonito
2.0,These gloves are very small and tight so if you have smaller hands it will be fine for you!
2.0,"as soon as I opened the bag one of the very cheap thin lenses fell to the floor. so far, not good"
2.0,"Poor quality and cheap. Bought for Halloween, regretting upon arrival. Would not recommend."
2.0,"The heart is pretty but not finished well. It is not scratchy & won't snag your clothes or anything like that, but looks as though not enough time & attention to detail was given ( there are lots of nicks in the heart )I recommend this necklace for activities in which you want to wear jewelry but wouldn't be upset if something happened to it. It was packed well. I did not attempt to contact the seller. Ok for the price."
2.0,Flimsy and cheaply made. Took 2 months to get. Buy something else
2.0,"The material they use for this product it's awfully cheap.  We get what we pay for,  it is similar as it's shown in the picture but it comes tosmall I order a large and I am a medium and it still fits too small"
2.0,One of the necklaces was broken upon delivery.
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes down and it was still large too large and shapeless.  I wanted to like the shirt because I likes the picture (so I even bought it in a couple different sizes) but ultimately I realized it‚Äôs just not a flattering shirt. At all. It‚Äôs very square and wide ‚Äîwhich I thought would be kind of nice since I try to conceal my midsection‚Äîbut it ended up just making me look 20lbs heavier.
2.0,"The fabric has no flex so should be looser in the hips, crotch, and thighs.  The 34 waist was so small I couldn't get close to buttoning, even with the elastic waistband.  All of my other tactical pants (other brands) are 34 and fit fine so this pair was not a true 34."
2.0,"Beautiful charm. Necklace, not so much. Broke within a week. So I recommend the charm, it‚Äôs worth the money but might want to opt for a better chain to put it on."
2.0,Runs a lot smaller and shorter than expected. Order at least a size up.
2.0,Really cute shoes! I bought a pair in white and pink for her in different sizes because I wasn‚Äôt sure which size would fit. The bigger size had an ankle strap that was huge but the next size down was to small. Both shoes ended up getting returned and we went with a better known brand.
2.0,"They were really cute when I first bought them, but after wearing them for about two hours they began to turn my fingers green and loose their color on the inside."
2.0,Should have ordered one size larger.
2.0,"The material in general is poor. As a result, the collar deformed upon washing. The print is great and that earned it an additional star. Unfortunately i will never wear this shirt in public due to the poor material."
2.0,"I was disappointed, being Philly born and raised, in the quality of this hat. The issue is the quality of this hat. The materials and stitching. The size is on the small size and the rim is even smaller. I thought this would be a cool hat to have, the ‚Äúcool‚Äù factor replaced with disappointment....."
2.0,The too small size makes the product inefficient in breast support.
2.0,"Not burgundy, more like red. Very large neck hole as would normally be found on women's clothing. Image is inaccurate."
2.0,Daughter loved it...bit it broke the first day she wore it...glad I got it on sale for under $2.00 or I would be really mad.
2.0,"This shirt is thin and tight. I usually wear a large but this size was not accommodating whatsoever (I am busty), but it looked like a loose fitting crop style top?"
2.0,It came with a large tear in the hem
2.0,Very small glasses.  Not for a wider face
2.0,"Chinese sizing, to small, sleeves to long, sweater length to long for a shirt 5'3"" person"
2.0,Top runs very small in bust area. I am a 34C so I ordered a small and a medium. The medium was too big and the small is too small in the cup.
2.0,"I really liked the style of this bag and was excited to get it in the mail but this crossbody bag is just way too small!  I thought I would be okay with it but I just couldn't work with the size.  The straps aren't all that long either, I like bags that hang more at the hip, more specifically the lower hip, but this one sits on the upper hip.  I don't carry a lot of stuff in my bag but this one was just way too small, I couldn't even put all the stuff in it that I do carry."
2.0,"These shirts run REALLY narrow!!! I bought this for my skinny 15 year old daughter, and the women's small was practically &#34;painted on&#34;, it was so narrow, small and tight."
2.0,cheap material dont waist your money
2.0,"Very, very stiff. I thought that it might give a little as it warmed up and got used, but nothing. You cant even use the draw string at the top to close the purse. Its very open leaving my stuff on show. Don't really like it, but having spent my fun money for a month I must wait to try and purchase another. It is very large with nice compartments, I just wish it had been made out of better material."
2.0,"THE FABRIC IS REALLY NICE, BUT THEY REALLY FOG UP AND it's VERY UNCOMFORTABLE"
2.0,My bracelet broke in a week. 1 ball on end came off
2.0,had lots of space in the waist and under the arms. Cloth looks cheap.
2.0,"Wondering how to contact Customer Service. Bought these for my 4 year old son March 2, 2021 and they are falling apart. Expected them to last longer. He absolutely loved these shoes and was heart broken when I told him he couldn‚Äôt wear them anymore. First pair of shoes that he has wore out before outgrowing."
2.0,The shoulders on this shirt is like a tank top not thick shoulder as seen on display pic
2.0,Washed twice and shrunk to be so short I risk exposing myself and became so sheer it‚Äôs unwearable. This is a good beach coverup but even nude munderwear shows through
2.0,Men-Women Face Mask Outdoor Protection Dust Prevention of Pack 1 is exact the same as the pic. The only issue I had is that your lips gets projected out .
2.0,I really wanted to like this. It was just to tight in the bust and not flowy enough for me. Also very see thru.
2.0,"Super cute shirt. I'm a size 8-10, I ordered a size large. It arrived and it's very forming fitting on my 14 year daughter who wears between xs-s in clothing. She inherited a shirt without asking. I would have given it more stars if it was even close to being truer to size. Order minimum of 2, or 3 sizes bigger than your normal."
2.0,They don't fit up to the waist.  They sit so low that I would have to keep pulling them up the whole time I have them on.
2.0,felt like a good quality however they were too tight for me. Also I tought they would be a little thicker.
2.0,"I have what I thought was the same/similar watch strap in brown, but I'm much more pleased with my brown one.<br /><br />The edges of this strap are sharp due to their plastic-y nature. We'll see if they soften over time, but for right now it's fairly uncomfortable"
2.0,"Material is thin, can see everything"
2.0,"Meant for tall girls, too long on the crutch area. Not meant for short people. Very disappointed."
2.0,The style & color was nice.  Had to return it though.  Much too sheer for me.
2.0,Way too big! I can use it as an overnight bag or diaper bag.
2.0,I like it but because im sensitive to certain metals I got an allergic reaction to it.
2.0,"Nice looking, but the clasp broke almost immediately"
2.0,I can not really say how well this will wear or last as it was very small.  I ordered a size up and still had issues with sizing.
2.0,"Not a bad bag, but I  didn't measure assuming the photo was true to size.  I need to send mine back, but it might be just what you need."
2.0,These earrings were initially ‚Äúlost in transit‚Äù so I had to reorder them. They arrived today and I was disapprove find that both earrings were separated from the backings when they arrived. I didn‚Äôt read the dimensions so it‚Äôs my own fault but they are smaller than I expected as well. I liked that they came with an additional layer of thin plastic on them so that there weren‚Äôt any scratches but I don‚Äôt want to have to repair brand new earrings.
2.0,I would have expected more from the product. A few classes and it ha a hole in them.
2.0,I got a 2X for my husband and it fits like all the other 2X's except in the sleeves. The sleeves are skinny and very long. We could deal with the snugness but not the length. My husband doesn't have short arms or anything. I dont know if this was a one off situation or not.  :(
2.0,Doesn't hold a lot
2.0,"This mask was good.  It arrived with the strap broken.  After I fixed it, My husband loved it."
2.0,Cute but ran small if you like a little give.  Easy return.
2.0,Smaller than my expectations
2.0,"No me gusto , la tela es muy √°spera y gruesa, las tallas no son tan exactas a las de uno me quedo grande y es M p√°rese L"
2.0,This scarf is not chiffon material ( like the other 3 I‚Äôve ordered). It is cotton. It does not feel the same. The colors are pretty though.
2.0,The dress is gorgeous but there is no way to wear it in public without getting arrested. It was just simply too low cut and showed more than I was able to cover.
2.0,There's a warning on the side of the can which reads &#34;may darken leather&#34;. No kidding. By about 4 shades. I did one boot and unfortunately had to keep going with the other.
2.0,I got these earrings for a rose gold themed wedding I was in. The earrings looked nice and paired well with my real rose gold jewelry. I was disappointed that I only wore these earrings for one day and already the hoops became discolored and turned black.
2.0,"It's a good neckace, chain is OK but the color doesn't match thw picture,  the real thing is brighter it looks pink not red"
2.0,"Dress runs very small.  Very short hem, does not depict the era if that is what you are looking for.  If you are just looking for a cute casual black dress this will work, but go larger than your normal dress size."
2.0,"This bag was everything I wanted a college student: fashionable, large enough for a few notebooks and a small laptop, and best of all water-proof and able to close to protect said laptop. I thought this was my dream come true, but 3 days into the semester after only carrying one notebook, a wallet, a water bottle, and two pens (2-3 lb at most), the material is already coming apart at the edges and the straps. I adore the style and material of the bag and do not have the heart to give it only a 1 star review, but I am so disappointed, the amount of time I will get out of this bag does not warrant the $39 I spent on it."
2.0,These run about 1-2 sizes too big & are heavy. Not what I would consider comfortable slippers.
2.0,Cheap. Will break easily.... Probably before it arrives to your mailbox
2.0,"It's pretty. No denying that. After 15 days the ring tarnished and had green buildup, my finger was also green. Oh well. It was a cheap ring and fun while it lasted. If you take it off for showers and sleep, I'm sure it will last significantly longer than it did for me."
2.0,"The glasses look pretty cool.  Nice to wear in the daytime without darkening everything you see.  Gives you a yellow tint instead.  But they do nothing to help with the glare from either the sun directly, or reflecting off of objects.  Nor do they help with the glare from headlights during the night time."
2.0,a little flimsier than I thought-I must not have read the description correctly
2.0,"I was trying to find a robe for summer that covered all the parts that I wouldn't want my brother or dad to see. Turns out this robe is short, and oddly made. I ordered an XL. Please note, I'm 5'7"", have some extra chub, but by no means am a large woman. I'd say I'm pretty average. The seams on the side of the robes that were supposed to match up with my sides were more lined up with my boobs, and the whole thing was too large, yet too small (I know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what it felt like. The material was stiff, but it may  have softened up once washed, but I never did because I knew I'd want to return it. I was disappointed overall."
2.0,"Length was fine,  but it was not loose fit.  Have to return."
2.0,"I ordered these for a Christmas present, he opened them today & one of the clips was broken so he can only wear 1. Would rate higher if it wasn‚Äôt broken."
2.0,sharp edges on bands snag silky clothing
2.0,"It‚Äôs ok I guess ,not soft at all quality was poor"
2.0,One of the aglets broke after two months of normal use and the others are not looking good
2.0,The sandals are really cute but squeak when walking. I‚Äôve had multiple pairs of these and this has never happened. They are very noisy and loud. Super disappointed in the quality this time. It‚Äôs almost like something wasnt sealed correctly bc its not coming from my foot its the underside of the shoe.
2.0,2 stars because this product is obnoxiously small and made for girls with no tiddies.
2.0,It was cute but I couldn't even try it on because one of the armholes was stitched too small so I returned it.<br />I thought the material was ok so was disappointed I couldn't try it on.
2.0,Nice looking but very scratchy and uncomfortable. I would return but I feel weird about returning an item like this and am stuck inside due to COVID-19 so can‚Äôt anyway.
2.0,Maybe ok for an office worker. Can't stay up (no pun intended) with a golfer. Had to pull up my pant legs and remove the dangling straps that had come loose.
2.0,"Don't waste your money on these, the nose piece fell off both pairs we purchased within 2 uses."
2.0,Nice fabric loved the deep V but it ran short through the torso. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and ordered the xxl. Returned it. Ordered the CLOZOZ brand instead and it was more generous in the length.
2.0,CHEAP!CHEAP!
2.0,I am 5‚Äô4 and 135 lbs and a size 4/6.  This green one was enormous on me and fit like a xxl. Not good for s/m. I got the jean one and that fit a little better but still a big big. Im keeping the jean flower one cause its cute and will work for gardening but way to big to ever wear out
2.0,Thinner than I expected it to be
2.0,"This blouse was ok but once again the size was too small. Really rough material and really wrinkled. Please adjust sizes to match american standards so the right sizes can be sent the first time. Biggest problem is size, then material."
2.0,To tight. Can't tell it's the Finnish flag. Picture is very deceiving.
2.0,The button that snaps your chest area together broke as I was trying to undo it; I pulled just ever so slightly really. The material of this dress is not the best - would be so much better in a different material
2.0,I wore this bracelet two times and it broke!!!
2.0,Not very useful- was hoping it helped night driving glare but it seems the same
2.0,"I'm disappointed - the rings look lovely and appear to be the exact size I wanted, but I can't open any of them."
2.0,"Super weird fit, especially along the upper back/shoulders. Very see-through so requires a camo. The only way I found even kind of comfortable to wear this is unbuttoned."
2.0,The colors were not as pictured so returned it. They were very helpful about the return
2.0,Smaller size then advertised
2.0,"Make no mistake, this is not chiffon, it's bathing suit material. The sizing is goofy, I bought two in different sizes, medium and large the labels say large and XL, I'm a busty size 6, they both fit well enough. Regarding quality, it looks like my 6 year old niece made it. I'm giving this 2 stars because it's a $6 dress and it is what I would have expected. It's a good enough maxi for the beach or casual day. What do you expect from something labeled &#34;Sex Dress&#34;?"
2.0,Super difficult to put on. I actually started bleeding from attempting to put it on. I think it stretched my piercing because i had to adjust the way the bar went in and for it to latch onto the other side.
2.0,Is nice but the size is way off
2.0,Nope. Sending it back. Eafengrow has a bunch of really great knives. This isn't one of them. You can do much better.
2.0,"Quality was decent but it was way too short in the torso. I'm 5'4&#34;, size 4/6 with a 34d bust and ordered a 10/12 and I couldn't pull it up high enough to cover half of my chest. The cups are lined and also had extra padding underneath along the underwire for more push up which I didn't like."
2.0,I thought it was a little bigger
2.0,"Got a XL still too small normally wear a L in USA sizing. Shirt is nice, size way too small"
2.0,"Too thin, doesn't hold its shape."
2.0,Material was fine. But they do not fit as the reviews claim.  Disappointed but I did keep the to wear when I clean the house.
2.0,I ordered a small and it‚Äôs too big. I‚Äôm 125lb and 5‚Äô6‚Äù. It had deodorant stains on it right out the package.
2.0,"I should have took Noah W (March, 2015) advice. He said &#34;It would be difficult to explain how ill-fitting this underwear is without being overtly explicit.&#34;  But I will explain... there is not anywhere near enough &#34;Pouch&#34; unless you have a &#34;very small package&#34;. Not enough material across the front. The grey bikini in the ad is very misleading to the amount of pouch. But, the material itself feels very durable and WOULD BE comfortable."
2.0,"not quite as shown, eyes were to close to edge to be seen.  Looks like geo design instead of cat"
2.0,I wore the shirt once. The material is odd and the sleeves were too wide. Ended up donating.
2.0,"It was small in the arms but loose around the waist. Not flattering at all, so I returned it."
2.0,Nicely made hat but arrived smashed and kinked up and i couldnt get the brim to sit right so i pitched it no biggie
2.0,I probably would have liked this if it fit but the sizing definitely runs very small.
2.0,"I felt the dress did not ‚Äúhang‚Äù right, and the fabric was not what I expected. I was rather disappointed with it, and have not worn it,"
2.0,This item is cut weirdly. Normally a dress &#34;fits&#34; better in the body and is small on my arms. This dress is OK on my arms but the body is very very small. I may have just gotten a bad cut but it doesn't flatter me at all. Not sure what body type this dress would be good for.
2.0,These glasses are too small! Not what i expected
2.0,"ordering this online is hit or miss, as you would have to be the same exact size and shape as the bra. pretty, though."
2.0,"Looks very fragile and I wanted the same look as well, but the chains are thick. I don't think i can wear it. Its better to pay a dollar more and have the satisfaction in the store rather than having high expectations &being disappointed when it arrives."
2.0,Material is too thin. T-shirt material. I thought it would be thicker.
2.0,Took awhile to get to me even though it said it was prime eligible and the material is pretty thin. It's not really worth the price.
2.0,I'm 6'1&#34;. 190 and always wear XL<br />THIS SHIRT WAS XL AND WAS WAY TOO TIGHT IN THE BACK SHOULDERS AND ARMS<br />HAD TO RETURN
2.0,Nice material and draping  but 2nd time wearing it and all the stitching if coming out.  May have ro repurposed as a skirt or some such!
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:eb3303d0ce65ce0a1bfba0ef8441e32d]] So disappointed, was really excited for this top. Its beautiful and the fit is great if you don't lift your arms.<br />then its pulls it all out of shape.. Happens when reaching out too"
2.0,I returned this shirt only because it was a lot shorter than I expected. It's like a half shirt and I'm short waisted.
2.0,"These pop off over & over again.  Very frustrating.  Doesn't seem to matter how you clamp them, they will keep popping.  The problem got worse after about 1 month, so maybe something loosens or weakens (and probably most of the high reviews were written before this started occurring)."
2.0,"Ad states :True To Size"" but these are made way to small."
2.0,"I purchased the size based on calf size plus added 1 size bigger to be safe.<br /><br />Because they are tight, I expected some effort to get them on, but it took more than anticipated.  Once on - they felt pretty good until the top band began to cause pain.  During the 2 or 3 hours I had them on, I kept adjusting the position of the band up and down my leg, but finally could not stand the pain so I decided to take them off.  Uh, Oh.  It was a HUGE struggle to work these off my legs and feet!  I'm not as agile as I used to be but I'm flexible from yoga and dance and have above-average coordination.  Still, it was VERY frustrating and no one was home to help pull them off.<br /><br />The top band is supposed to be wide enough to be non-binding but it was so tight it hurt and left deep, red, imprints on my legs when removed.<br />I planned to return them but had to leave the state to care for my 90-year-old mom.  When I got home, the 30 day return window had ended about 10 days beforehand.  I contacted the seller and they were NOT sympathetic.  They refused to accept a return after the 30 days  -- &#34;Too bad, so sad, but we don't care!&#34;<br />Nice attitude, NOT.<br /><br />If you have a difficult time getting them on, be sure that someone is home to help you get them off.  Unless they are too big to do their job, they won't just roll down and they can't be pulled off in one fell swoop."
2.0,"Not as warm as expected, isn't form fitting like described."
2.0,Very disappointed already has a hole in it not very old
2.0,From the pictures I thought the hat was white with the NY logo. It‚Äôs not- it‚Äôs a strange tan/beige color.
2.0,"Didn't like it, gave it away"
2.0,"The sleeves were so long that I had to pin the shirt to my jacket, which meant I couldn't take the jacket off without taking the shirt off. I've owned several tuxedo shirts in the past without any problems. Since my event wasn't until April, it was too late to return the shirt."
2.0,Metal is too thin and painful to wear for a prolonged period of time
2.0,I did not like the fabric or the fit. The color was more yellow than green and to return it was a hassle to get the return label.
2.0,cute too but the strap broke immediately upon trying on
2.0,I like the design and color but it is too big. Thanks.
2.0,Incomfortable.
2.0,Very unhappy. The plugs do not match at all. Completely different colors.
2.0,"Other reviews right, logo too big. If you dig the Soviet look, find a different one. But for a nice snug balaclava, for riding a motorcycle, I‚Äôm keeping it."
2.0,"A number of the lights did not work.  I contacted the seller, giving the number of each color that did not work.  They promptly replied and shipped replacements.  Several of the replacements did not work.  I'll just take the loss."
2.0,These were soft and comfortable but completely see through. I had to return them.
2.0,The product it's self is good but size runs very small  other then that good she loved it but only had it on twice before she couldn't for it anymore
2.0,This dress fits small in the bust and is way too long. I am 5'10&#34; and it's too long for me even with heels. I think the material stretches to easily.
2.0,The inner panels (circles) don't work at all; they're only decorative. You can buy a better watch for the same price.
2.0,Nice looking but doesn‚Äôt keep time for longer than a day regardless of how long and active you are when you wear it.
2.0,"Cheap, cheap, cheap material. Pattern and style as shown."
2.0,Worse pair I ever bought
2.0,Very small for size and also very short.
2.0,Bought for my daughter‚Äôs soccer game since they are now required She says they are actually much harder to breathe then while running the standard mask
2.0,"Received today and when I opened the package, the shirt smelled like cigarette. Also the shirt is shorter than the picture."
2.0,Leatherate or leather like and great as novelty
2.0,super ugly on me. forget about it and never returned. one side just completely folds over . not flattering
2.0,The logo positioning and size is off to me which throws off the rest of the hat.  The logo is smaller than pictured
2.0,On the purse I thought it was bigger than it is. On the other order I was going to return it but it would have cost me more then what I paid for it so I had no choice but to keep it
2.0,It‚Äôs nice but It‚Äôs kinda Korny I have it too my kid.
2.0,"The material is pretty scratchy, the legs are super weirdly shaped (I plan on hemming them into shorts because of how strangley they fit), and the torso doesn't seem to be made for a human body.<br />Probably would not purchase again."
2.0,"Not what I had hoped for. After adding 2 or 3 keys to each ring, they bent out of shape. They‚Äôll work but they‚Äôre not great."
2.0,"Love the item itself, but I have bought two now and both of the puffballs have fallen off from my keychain!! Have not had the product long before each time the product broke. Thought it might of just been a defective one at first, but after second purchase I am very upset it has happen again."
2.0,"Have ordered several of these shirts and love them, but this one came with a scorch mark through the packaging. I tried to contact the seller, never heard back from them. If/when I do, I will update review."
2.0,Stiff and rough
2.0,Functions well. It broke way too quickly.
2.0,Order a size larger than you think. Low waisted and shorter than I expected.
2.0,HUGE earrings!!!
2.0,"They ARE leaking, have not returned only because of shipping cost."
2.0,"Very cute but extremely small, could fit a doll."
2.0,"I heeded the advice in the other comments and ordered the largest size, since I wanted it loose fitting. The shirt was as mentioned, smaller than I expected. The material was see-through except for the stitched seams which made for an odd appearance. I sent it back."
2.0,I was looking for pure white scarf but when it was delivered it is an eggshell color
2.0,"Pants did not hv enough stretch to them in the buttocks! My rear end is the highlight of any outfit and she could not shine.... the first was very Plummer butt-esk.  Jacket was ahight, not crazy about the white lining but I guess I get what u pay for."
2.0,Socks are very small and not comfortable
2.0,When did not fit I was told to donate it and was issued a refund of $10 when I paid like 90 for it.
2.0,"It‚Äôs okay at best. The color for the ‚Äúapricot‚Äù I thought would be ivory there‚Äôs a bit of a yellow hue to it. It‚Äôs pretty thin. Material around button is like a sheer fabric. I thought I was able to dupe free people but you get what you pay for lol. It‚Äôs not horrible by any means, I‚Äôll wear it but it‚Äôs def not what I was expecting either. There also no collar to it."
2.0,"The costume itself is now fine, but there were some problems with the way that it was set up/packaged for delivery.  First, the battery pack for the lights did not work until my husband opened it up with a screwdriver and fixed the battery connections. Second, there was  not work until my husband opened it up with a screwdriver and fixed the battery connections. Second, there was a random 4 on an Avery label/sticker  stuck to the back of the costume. (see photo) it took me some time to pick off the sticker, and then use a goo gone product to remove the adhesive.  Not our best purchase from Amazon.  Pretty disappointed."
2.0,"Some things don't add up with this product. It is advertised as a men's fishing vest.  I bought a medium, the tag says it is a 2XL but it fits slightly snug for a medium.  Length is normal, chest is a little tight.  Zipper is not easy to use and more importantly, the slider is on the left side.  I own no other garment with the slider on the left side. Either this product is a ladies vest or a child's.  Disappointed in product but too much hassle to return.  I will donate it to our church's rummage sale."
2.0,"I loved this gorgeous top, especially the beautiful bell sleeves, but unfortunately the cloth-covered buttons kept falling off and I had to return it twice."
2.0,"Cute pants but a very odd fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 120ish pounds. They were tight in the butt and thighs to the point they were uncomfortable but a medium would have been too big. Bow was cute and the length was good. Just not a great fit, no give in the fabric. I returned these."
2.0,"Fit is great but stain easily which is very disappointing! Sunblock, vaseline  (or any oily lotion) will leave a PERMANENT STAIN on the dress. This is supposed to be for the beach so I can‚Äôt use sunblock?! I got the blue and stains were visible. Poor quality."
2.0,"I am 5'6&#34;, 34/29/36.  I ordered the medium.  I am not very impressed with this dress and will be returning it.  While the top section of the dress did fit, the material is thin and truly meant to only be a beach cover-up.  However, the bottom was not floor length, more upper ankle.  Also there are these weird key-hole cuts on each side of the dress above the hip.  I think they are supposed to mimic the keyhole in the front, but they just look strange and pucker out at the side a bit.  Definitely looks better on the site."
2.0,"This was so disappointing,  One reviewer said it had a &#34;housecoat&#34; look.  I so agree.  The fabric is thick like an old time housecoat. It doesnt lay flat above my bust. Would need to be altered. The waist doesnt gather as much as in the picture.  I am a size 4-110 lbs and ordered a small; too big."
2.0,"I've been looking for light summer dresses that I can wear while working from home this summer, and this looked so cute! It is extremely snug on me, though, and I'm afraid as soon as I wash it I won't even be able to fit in it at all. There's no way I could ever wear a bathing suit under this, it was that snug. I will probably end up giving this to a friend. :(<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in return for an honest review."
2.0,"Too small for me... i am tall 5'11"" and they were SMALL. I will give them to a friend... they are nice enough to give as a gift."
2.0,Great coat warm just the size is off. It said would be 3x but fits like a 2x
2.0,"Spent an hour and a half going through the included (tiny) instructions to get the time set. Finally figured that rather than using the printed steps to get the watch out of 24 hour mode (and into 12-hour mode), you had to skip the ""press C button and stop until 24-system is used"" and just leave the watch in default time display mode and only ""press B button"" to toggle between 12/24 modes. The worst part was removing links from the watchband, using the included tool and referencing the steps on the product page here at amazon (thank goodness for them because nothing arrived with the watch) I discovered the pins used to retain the links are very tiny cotter pins. I also discovered the thread-able screw-tip to the tool to be weak points and it was best utilized by keeping it in the guide. I finally had to resort to using pliers to remove one of the cotter pins (thankfully I was able to remove another from a link I was discarding to re-use as removing the first required plies to remove). The pin that ultimately attaches the end of the band to the clasp is not a cotter pin but a pin with dual spring loaded pins to attach to the clasp. Also, the clasp has a secondary clip that folds down that (I guess) is supposed to help keep the clasp closed but is very bothersome to keep out of the way when removing the watch. I have spent over $100 in the past for a wristwatch but when something has gone awry in the button mechanisms I found it more economical to buy a new watch instead of paying the fee to repair (which is typically more than half the original watch). There is no setting to account for daylight saving time on this watch either. Had I known the adjustments would be so trying, I would have ordered a jeweler's kit or just run down to a jeweler's store and paid the $15 to have had them done it. I guess you get what you pay for but would not recommend this watch (have also found no way to disable the watch from beeping when cycling through the modes/displays)."
2.0,"Sleeves are not going to match the size material, is 1way stretch fabric so its not for working out in, you will sweat to death..for sure not breatheable fabric..this is more for cold seasons"
2.0,"They seem durable enough but I bought them for my son and they‚Äôre way too big! They‚Äôre even too big for my face (which is admittedly smallish) but it fit my husband‚Äôs face, beard and all!"
2.0,"Purchased this product in hopes that it would be a good replacement for my broken charge 2 band.  Looks like a thicker band in the picture.  Turned out to be a thin, obviously made for a female sized band.  Tried to give it to my wife, but it was difficult to adjust and did not come with instructions to help figure it out."
2.0,"Received watch today.  Very,  very disappointed!  Doesn't light up like its supposed to.  Daughter was very upset.  You should check items before sending them to customers to make sure they work properly.<br /><br />I'm editing my review now.<br /><br />Had to open back cover of watch to check battrries.  They were loose so I tighten up the screws and now it lights up.  Daughter ecstatic now.  Loves it!  But I  shouldn't of had to take it apart when it is brand new."
2.0,They are coming loose at the seams the seams are coming apart
2.0,Front cut way too low
2.0,Came with a hole. Not like real yoga pants and feel cheap. Overall are comfy but not to ever wear out.
2.0,"I‚Äôm so bummed. I was waiting for these and looking so forward to wearing them at work, especially the blue ones. Love the style and it looks great on but they don‚Äôt help at all in the wrong strength."
2.0,Thin and see through. I had to send this back.
2.0,"Very hard to unclip, super frustrating"
2.0,"I wanted to like these but sadly I didn't. They are very poorly made. The metal frames are made from a brittel metal that broke within 2 mins of trying to adjust. When they arrived, the front face was almost flat so I gave them a little bend at the bridge. Immediately the bronzish/gold metal began to crack. Then when I tried to adjust the left arm, it just snapped off.  They glasses are just okay. They are polarized but there is almost no tinting to them. The nose frame is just a joke. Its made of 24 gauge wire with a hard rubber piece. The only good thing I can say is that they come with a case that isnt bad. Save your money and look elsewhere."
2.0,"Pretty. But too small. I bought one for my 6-yr-old, but can only fit my 3-yr-old."
2.0,"Ordered in a Medium based off of sizing chart, but fit nothing like the model. Pant leg was wider vs the photos. Waste fit great. Also, the color was a much darker brown vs the light tan color shown. Returned for a Small and it did NOT fit the waste, but was still baggy on the leg"
2.0,Way overpriced. Comparable to gas station sunglasses. Very disappointed on the quality.
2.0,This biker short  is really a Mopas . Its very light weight and the are shorter then you think they will be.
2.0,This dress was more of a mint green than the deeper green shown. Material is very thin...ordered XL still get too snug!
2.0,"This is not a sweater. It was skin tight, spandex garment"
2.0,The shirt I received does not look like the shirt in the photo
2.0,"Felt more like a 22 than a 20, hurts my nose to have it in."
2.0,"It was cute, and cute material, a little things though. It also was very wide, like an unflattering wideness, so I returned it."
2.0,Material is thin. Looks cheap.
2.0,Cheaply made. You get what you pay for most of the time.
2.0,I could barely read the ‚ÄúAmsterdam Netherlands‚Äù on the charm. The writing was so small.
2.0,"Adorable but broke. Bought for my grand daughter. Disappointed that the quality, durability wasn‚Äôt there."
2.0,Way too big. I ordered a medium and this fit like it was a 2xl or something lol
2.0,Haven't tried sound quality yet but the hat itself is quite long. Will fit someone with a larger head.
2.0,"Cute suit but back is light yellow and very see through when wet. My daughter will not wear because she is embarrassed of her rear end showing through, so ultimately it was a waste of my money."
2.0,Nice colors but fit was frumpy looking
2.0,Would be great but I find myself retightening this belt constantly because it works itself loose.
2.0,was smaller than I thought
2.0,BROKE WITHIN 2 HRS
2.0,"Very small.  I bought it for me for my Halloween costume, but it's super small for me. It fits my 6 year perfectly though."
2.0,Fits like a thick lycra swimsuit. Get at least the next size up.
2.0,Uncomfortable under arm area
2.0,"I love the colors but, I was unhappy once I washed them and the wire would come out of the bra each time. I even put them in a bag in my washing machine."
2.0,Collects so much lint and fuzz! it's like a magnet. Doubt my daughter will wear it anymore. She wore it once for pictures.
2.0,"Very cute - however it arrived broken. While I was trying to fix it, it broke in another place. Then as I continued to attempt to fix the connections between the bigger, colored, circles, the small connections would keep breaking."
2.0,I tried two different sizes. The fit was not as flattering as I expect a racer back tank to be...
2.0,"I ordered two, they came in quicker than expected, are too light weight for the clasp hardware, hook on for left handed, three leather lace strands are gray and the owl strand had come apart. Cute for young girls. Cheap in many ways.  You can make them a lot better using items from the local craft store. I would not order again."
2.0,3x save your $$$.... Too tight on sholdes.<br />We are men..... We need better fit
2.0,"Overall, this is exactly what I was hoping for, save for one thing: the color.  In the images, it appears to be a creamy beige with grey stripes. In person, the beige is more on the yellow spectrum and the stripes are dark grey.<br /><br />Edit: I never wear this due to the amount of fuzz that comes off of this thing!"
2.0,I got this and loved it!!! Wore it and it keeps tangling up so bad I have to take it off to fix. In two weeks it has already turned a bronze color and turns my next green.
2.0,"Perfect size. Holds lots of &#34;stuff&#34;. The only problem, after just a few weeks the lining pulled loose from stitching and shredded. Hung in zippers and made big mess. To bad fine other wise."
2.0,Completely see through. Not like photo
2.0,The dress was a little large.  I ended up returning it because it arrived with a pulled thread across the top of the dress.  I ordered the ivory and didn't like it but I'm sure it would be flattering in other colors
2.0,"Colors appeared very faded upon arrival, and was poor quality. Did not expect that for the price."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt end up keeping it. It had no structure to the piece so it looks blanket or robe like
2.0,Came in missing pieces but I didn‚Äôt like the earrings so I used pieces off the earrings to fix where there were missing pieces.
2.0,"I saw a lot of great reviews about this dress but I was honestly a little disappointed with it. As flattering as it is, it wrinkles very easily and needs ironing every time I pack it for travel. Thank goodness that hotels have ironing boards when I'm on the go for events!"
2.0,One arrived broken
2.0,"Fabric feels rough, fits large and really wrinkles."
2.0,I thought it came with the little shirt peice underneath but it didn't.
2.0,The words on it is not imprinted very well.  I am afraid that they will rub off....
2.0,"I bought the two-pack. The fabric was uncomfortable, and was more like extra-firm control. These are not as high-wasted as the photo indicates and tend to roll down."
2.0,The material makes you sweat and it‚Äôs too tight around the chest and too loose on the stomach
2.0,Nothing like the picture.  A big bag with sleeves.  Awful to even look at
2.0,These are HUGE. They almost go to my shoulders. I should've checked measurements before buying. I never wear them. I also thought the metal would be more delicate looking but it's quite thick.
2.0,Would've worked for what I needed it for.  Cheap and the zipper broke off before I could even try it on! Disappointing- I needed this fast for a last minute party now I'll have to stress and find something else quick
2.0,Missing a stone. I'll just chalk it up to a loss because I'm not repacking and going 15 minutes out my way to return it. At least one is 100% usable.
2.0,The waist is way to small for a large and the length would go way too long if I didn't pull them up above my ankles. This means there is a lot of cloth bunching together between my ankle and knee.
2.0,"Very disappointed in these, bought 3 pair last month.  First time I wore them and the waistband rolls down, they are light weight and there is no tummy control...how can there be when waistband rolls down.  Too late for me to return now.  Thought I was getting  product similar to a different brand I own.  Definitely not the same quality  NO GO Ladies to these"
2.0,The fabric not what I expected
2.0,"The earrings were pretty but I did not like the screw backs because they were too short for the earring post and really the post was too long. It caused the earring to hang which it should not because it is a post, so I sent them back. Do not recommend them unless the company want to change the backs."
2.0,Way smaller than i was expecting for the price. Disappointed
2.0,"The product was as described however I was given a delivery date of December 17th-22nd and it did not arrive until the 28th, so about a week late. Something to consider if you plan to buy this product."
2.0,I ordered according to my daughter's measurements and it was inches too big. We sized down. Still too big.
2.0,"I received one hat that was perfect. The other hat (red) did not have the CC label and had a section of poor stitching that is already coming apart, and it hasn‚Äôt even been worn yet. Very disappointed in this order."
2.0,"Although the pendant is nice, the loop that attaches to the necklace broke as soon as I put it on. Very thin and cheap. Necklace not that great either."
2.0,I did not get the red tie. Only two ties in the package.
2.0,"Great style,  but sold as a women's large and is too small for a woman that wears size 8"
2.0,Loved the vintage design but it was way too small and had a weird neck. I don't recommend.
2.0,Do not fit on my bottle rocket frame had to return.
2.0,Very small. Go up 2 sizes
2.0,Too tight for adult faces
2.0,The material was on the see-through side and it felt dated and cheap. Returned.
2.0,"The style is great, but after a couple of months the winding stem came off when I pulled it to adjust the time; I replaced it and it works but now its a bit noisy when winding. Keeps accurate time but not highest quality"
2.0,Was so disappointed. I am 5'6. I weight 215 lbs. I wear a size 38 DD bra. There was too much room up top for this dress in a size 14. My husband informed me he probably wouldn't be able to zip up a 12. So I bought a different style from the same maker.
2.0,"Does not look to flattering on the ladies with bigger chest, too bulky bow on top"
2.0,This fabric is 100% polyester.  Seller had stated in Q&A that it was 8% spandex.
2.0,"Not a fan at all. Material seems cheap, the band is constantly coming loose, the connection points seem weak and its easy to lose a pin when changing bands as they are not held in place.  Will be returning."
2.0,"Definitely not for a man. Mainly if your head/face is a little big, this is too tight. It doesn't stretch much. It's wearable but not all that comfortable since it's tightly on your face"
2.0,Loved the comforter and style however they ride up. Won‚Äôt stay in place so it makes layering impossible.
2.0,Very pretty but cheap hardware makes this wallet unusable.  The metal clasps and magnet that holds the wallet closed is of such poor quality that it opens at the slightest pressure.  I would be very concerned about losing contents.  I am returning this wallet.
2.0,This necklace pinches my neck. Maybe can wear with a turtleneck top. The bracelet is great but my arm is not as sensitive as the neck.
2.0,"Got this watch in the mail and tried to adjust with the included tool, but the pins were lacquered over and it was impossible to get the pins out to adjust.  Also- it was very hard for me to read the dial.  It is a pretty watch, but didn't work for me, so back it went."
2.0,"I almost lost my Fitbit because of it disconnecting suddenly. Also after a short time, rubbing to clean it, makes it worse. It looked awful."
2.0,This is not what I recieved at all.  returning
2.0,I've had this band for about 13 months until it finally broke in my sleep last night. The material of the band is more brittle than the original and doesn't hold up as it slowly developed cracks during the 13 months of use. I've had to epoxy the loop to extend it's life. My Mi Band 2 module also would often pop out while playing sports since the plastic that holds the module had also developed cracks.
2.0,Material feels cheap and sizing was off.
2.0,"Cheaply made. I never wore it, but waited to long to return it. Probably will never wear."
2.0,"When you install these on your glasses, there is a metal bar that rests directly on the front of the lenses, which will inevitably scratch the lenses.  I ended up breaking the metal bars off.  If you look at the picture that Amazon shows for this product, it looks like somebody has edited out or broken off the bar on the left side, but the bar on the right it still there."
2.0,The spandex in this dress makes it stretch and easy fit.  There are darts at the front of the dress that are not apparent from the picture that make the dress bell out to some extent from the high waist. The front tie is not as wide as I thought it would be. The dress is also described as loose and flowy and that is not the case. The spandex makes it cling.  The color is rich and the dress is light but not see through
2.0,The product came in with holes in the seems as if they tried take out the tags. It smelled like clothing that had been in storage and no matter that I washed it twice it continued to smell
2.0,"dont like , look cheap"
2.0,Strap isn't that long and I'm only 5'2&#34;. It hits me on my high hip on the last setting. Material is very hard to almost like a case but maybe a little less. A lot bigger than expected to but does have a lot of good pockets.
2.0,"Got this, big, heavy, looks nice.  Noticed a little imperfection, picked at it and it got bigger.<br /><br />Placed on some rocks, scratched easily, then I realized it's just clear glass with a purple coating, sorta like tinted windows."
2.0,Look is good but its not locking properly and often its falling down :-(
2.0,"They sit weird on my waist, and start to fall when I put my phone in the pocket. If you normally like the high waist, these are not for you."
2.0,"Order one size bigger. Cheap. Doesn't fit up top, too tight."
2.0,The brief liner is awful.  Way too skinny.  Everything spills to either side and isn't held in place.  Their cheaper shorts are better.  It's a shame as the fabric is nice.
2.0,"I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm not allowed to post a picture,  but this bag is pretty floppy and doesn‚Äôt stand on its own. It feels similar to a travel bag from a sports store."
2.0,Broke the 1st week
2.0,Fit a little big in the waist and way too big around my thighs.
2.0,I wear a 2x normally and have a 42 G bra size. This shirt looks very cheap when on. It is made out of stretchy t-shirt material and looks awesome. Super disappointed.
2.0,The band is definitely too small and I don't think ordering a size up makes a difference.
2.0,I like the dress but there is a terrible smell on it. It must have come from the manufacturer this way as it was wrapped in a plastic bag on the outside and folded into a zip top bag on the inside. I am attempting to wash but not hopeful
2.0,"The jewelry is ok, but the tiara is worthless. It doesn't come out together and when you try to bend it into the headband it breaks."
2.0,Unfortunately the pants didn't make it through on session of aerial yoga. Seam split in the middle.
2.0,"Both pairs of shorts are completely see through.  They are made of a pantyhose type material and resemble underwear more than shorts.  I wore the white pair under a white costume, but they were still not full coverage."
2.0,"""Soft"" should be removed from the Product Name and Product Details. The masks are super stiff after hand washing and hang drying, and machine washing and tumbling drying. Also, the earloops are not good for glasses wearers. The earloops cause glasses to keep slipping and falling off."
2.0,"These earrings would be incredibly cute if they weren't so cheaply made. Upon opening my Amazon package I realized the string tassels on the earring were strewn throughout the box. One earring was broken, with the second metal piece being detached from the top metal piece, and what was left of the tassels that were attached was a tangled mess. The backs of the earrings were also very bent, and had to be straightened. I really wanted to like these, but they're just too cheaply made."
2.0,Poorly made. The little medalians at the end of bracelet were  loose in the bag.
2.0,"I ordered a medium, which is my normal size. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and weigh around 130. First of all, the materials RT y is a bit shinny, and the fit fabric is baggy around the knees. I believe the issue is the quality of fabric. It is not a compression fabric, AT ALL. Also the waist has a piece of 1 inch elastic so it isn‚Äôt very forgiving in the tummy area. I felt like I looked like a crazy person. Good luck!"
2.0,Somewhat small and the armpit holes are weird.
2.0,"These look good but unless you tie them in a knot,  they slide off. Too slippery."
2.0,"Bought a medium, but its a bit too large. Also it has not shape, just looks like I'm wearing a bright bag. Wish I could return it."
2.0,I purchased a medium but the fit was more like bottoms a medium and top fit like a small. Fabrics are nice but I won‚Äôt be wearing the top
2.0,I have worn these two times and when I put them on for the third time there were tiny holes all along the seems.
2.0,Smelt kinda weird. Flimsy kinda odd material.  Seems cheap and was real tight on my arms
2.0,The color and images are very nice and bright. Unfortunately the shirt says XL but looks like/fits a medium. Does not fit.
2.0,"Very cute, but do not expect to get more than one wear out of this. Several of the ribbons around the waist started unraveling & the tie in the back broke just after one wear. We literally only wore for 1 yr photos & then I threw it in the trash."
2.0,Way to small for American<br />Better check size chart and update it to fit American woman
2.0,Its crap sorry but it is
2.0,These are very cute pants but the waistband in the picture is deceiving - it has a 1 inch elastic in the waistband that is very tight and uncomfortable as a result I had to return them.
2.0,Outside strap of the left shoe stretched out of shape.  Shoes not wearable.  Nice color and  the right shoe comfortable. A manufactured defect. Would not buy again
2.0,"Followed advice in all the reviews and ordered bigger than I normally would. I'm 5'7"" about 145-150 lbs. Normally wear a 10 or 11 in jeans, depending on the brand. XL isn't even close to being able to fit me. I wasn't even able to get the bottoms up one of my thighs. The top fit... somewhat. I'm not busty by any means(34C) but I would be really worried this thing would slip up if I move too suddenly. There's quite a bit of underboob going on.<br /><br />I'll keep it around for when I lose a bit of weight and try again, but I'm not hopeful."
2.0,Did not fit my Pandora bracelet.
2.0,Not very fashionable in person. Looks more like Wednesday Adams from the Adams family
2.0,This would be great if it wasn‚Äôt so big. Doesn‚Äôt even stay on my over 6foot (200lb) husband.
2.0,"The deep v neck is also very wide, meaning that it opens up and shows the headlights.  Cheap material and runs big."
2.0,"My son used it to play soccer. It was very clear that he cannot see the ball clearly. The transparent part on the nose and the parts on the cheeks make it very hard to see through to follow the ball. He used it 4 times and every time, it was very clear even to the spectators that he cannot see the ball with the mask on. It is written that this mask is for soccer, but it does not seem useful for soccer at all."
2.0,Love the style but the glasses are loose and fall off easily. I attempted to tighten the screws but they will not tighten.
2.0,It‚Äôs nice but while I have never had a problem with sizing this was to small
2.0,I have had these glasses for over 2 months. The lens collar and clarity was awesome. Then I did some yard work and cleaned the lenses off with some down dish soap. The finish started to rub off.
2.0,"The quality is alright, but the fit was not as expected. I went by the sizing chart and it was still a little snug. I honestly wish I would‚Äôve ordered something else but you live and learn, right?"
2.0,The red ink rubbed off within a week of normal use. Now it's not nearly as recognisable.
2.0,"The ad states that this is a wool hat. It appears to be cotton. I was looking for a warm hat, this is not it. And it took a long time to get."
2.0,I was really surprised how poorly made this was. I‚Äôve bought Calvin Klein a lot in the past including underwear. One of the side seams is totally off from the other side and makes the shirt look off balance. I only wear it in the house as a result - disappointed.
2.0,I do not like the material of the mask and the graphic is not printed clearly. Not good quality.
2.0,I didn't feel any difference. Gave it to my mom
2.0,"Even the large size is still much too large for my 6', 180# frame. Returning it.Hope a medium will work If not, I give up on these."
2.0,Poor stitching.
2.0,"The shirt is not white, more of a yellow color. Bought to wear under white dress, in contrast, definitely stood out as yellow. Mine arrived as if it was a prior return. Broken tags, none attached and were torn in bag. Didn't have enough time to return and exchange. It was for an international trip."
2.0,"This dress is lovely, except for the color."
2.0,Runs small and was sent incorrect size twice.
2.0,very small and cheap looking.
2.0,Too wide.  Used pinking shears and cut 2 stripes off.  Much better and like wide brims.
2.0,My tragus is very small so it was painful to put these in and they stick out very far.
2.0,My daughter loves it and a lot of other girls are always pointing since it‚Äôs popular.  As a parent that spent a decent amount of money for it the quality of the product is poor.  Have not dried if in the dryer because I figure if we do the print is toast.  Quality of the print is kind of blurry.  Sweater is pretty thin.
2.0,What I just said.
2.0,"Came with a HUGE run in the back. Already threw away the bag it came in, before noticing it, so I cannot return it. I also think the fabric is cheap feeling. Pretty unhappy with this dress."
2.0,Not what I had anticipated.
2.0,Not as good as the picture. Sending back
2.0,"The wrong size was shipped to me. The print on the back of the shirt said &#34;Size Small&#34; however, the tag on the shirt said &#34;Size Medium&#34;. Not sure what happened at the manufacturer."
2.0,"I love Hurricane popcorn and spicy food, so I was excited to try this. They need to rethink this one though. I can‚Äôt get past two bites without sneezing and choking on the pepper powder. My dog is watching me and is very worried and probably thinks I‚Äôm dying. They could have just made it a dried Kim Chee package and some pepper flakes that you can‚Äôt breathe in instead of this powder. If you try it make sure you don‚Äôt breathe in when you take bites otherwise you‚Äôll make your dog very worried."
2.0,Very cheaply made for the cost.  Sending it back.
2.0,"The image on this charm is so small that you need to magnify it to make out what it is.  I gave it as a gift, but wished I would have returned it."
2.0,"My daughter wore it on her shoulder with a couple items inside. She bent down to pick up an item and the strap broke. I like the purse style yet, it's not durable."
2.0,"These are NOT satin bonnets. They are plastic shower caps. The outside appears satin,  but it's not.  The inside is all plastic.  They are very cute shower caps,  but not what I ordered."
2.0,My previous review was honest that was before I stared using this handbag. The handle fell off and made some scratch around the handles.
2.0,This is not for cold rainy weather.  Get a size larger as the size I got was too small.  Sleeves are also shorter than expected.
2.0,"Make is small and it's very thin, color is nice."
2.0,"Not great.  Doesn‚Äôt stay on face great and is warmer than other thinner models I‚Äôve tried.<br />They are cheap and ok to have as extras, but if you plan to wear for long periods...look elsewhere."
2.0,"Super cute but way to big for a newborn. The sleeves and neck are very large. It is long, but that's not a problem because it allows for the length to be adjusted. I would give it 5 stars if the neck and arms fit."
2.0,Very thin material.  The zipped pockets aren‚Äôt big enough even for my small hands
2.0,"I received this on sale for buy one get one free. If that wasn't the case, I'd probably return them. The material is soft, but very thin. The holes in the design of the fabric are small but just big enough that you can see skin through them. When holding the shirt up to light, you can see right through it. A nude bra works but I'd be uncomfortable wearing this in an office setting without an undershirt. It's also a weird boxy like fit. The curved hem comes up really high on the sides and if I lift my arms you can see the sides of my torso even while wearing high waisted jeans. (I ordered a large. I'm 5'2"" and 165lbs.)"
2.0,I‚Äôm 6 months pregnant and I ordered a 2xl since the reviews said it fits a little big .. but it was a little small. Pretty color. It is very lightweight though. Just not a good fit for me.
2.0,Was not neat like the picture it is like a sweatshirt for the gym
2.0,"Got one for my husband and when it arrived had him try it on. I was going to send it back regardless because he wasn‚Äôt a fan of how the 3/4 sleeve looked on him, but then we noticed there were stains on the shirt. Won‚Äôt be purchasing these anymore."
2.0,"Very cheap quality, I received it bent in all different angles. Also missing several rhinestones including the biggest (most noticeable one). The paint is not even throughout. My expectations were not high but I didn‚Äôt it expect to be this disappointed in the purchase."
2.0,This would be perfect for a child playing dress up...very poor quality for a teenager or young woman to wear.
2.0,"Disappointed with this T-shirt. The type of shirt in the picture and the one you receive in the mail are two completely different types of shirts. The one you receive is boxy and has larger sleeves like a normal cut t-shirt, I had to return the one I ordered because after the first wash it was child size. I am thin but tall so I ordered a medium, which fit before I washed it, but after it was washed it was no longer adult size."
2.0,"It was a gift.. It is way too tight, it squishes your nose uncomfortably"
2.0,"I expected stick covers, they are cheap sticks instead. Guess I should have paid a closer look."
2.0,These earrings look really nice on... but definitely NOT WORTH the money this company is asking.  You can find the exact same pair much cheaper.
2.0,"I wrote two reviews of the same style because it is both too small AND too big!  Arm holes and top band is small but the body is like a big balloon!  Too bad, could have been cute."
2.0,34c & I felt like this smooshed & pulled the girls down. Not the look I was going for. Returned it & ordered a regular strapless bra.
2.0,"Ok, these are really pretty shoes and they deserve stars for that. As far as their other qualities, not so great. They run a little small and a lot narrow, making my little toe peek out like a tiny little sausage between the straps, not pretty. They don't have cushioning at the ball of foot, so even though it's a short heel, I wanted to wail in pain after a few hours. I hate to say it, but these were a disappointment."
2.0,This was not for me. The sizing was just all wrong.
2.0,"The gauges run small, the zero gauge is smaller than an actual zero gauge. Don‚Äôt buy!"
2.0,Too small in thighs and crotch. Oh and the biggest thing was they didn‚Äôt have a zipper to revert to shorts. Was ok quality otherwise.
2.0,"It looks nice and fits my Fitbit charge 3, but I was able to disconnect the band with the slightest of tugs. This will work great for most people. But those that like getting their hands dirty, work labor, or are generally active...this will not hold up. I'm just going to bite the bullet and order a replacement band from Fitbit. You get what you pay for and I was just trying to save money."
2.0,my son loved the necklace.  However after about 2 weeks it started coming apart.
2.0,you have to order like two size more of what you fit so it can be right
2.0,XXL for waist 34
2.0,It is possible I didn't read the description well enough but it is like wearing a vinyl tablecloth with strings.  I will return.
2.0,Turned after a month. Cheap price so good for kids but not high quality obviously.
2.0,"I didn't like this shirt very much at all. It was huge, and fabric was way too slick for my liking."
2.0,"Way too small, you can barely see them which makes them hell to get in/out."
2.0,Ok. But my eyes did not fit in any of the masks.
2.0,I purchased the Portofino glasses and were told they were purple these are not at all they are blue‚Ä¶ Except if you tilt your head back then you see purple‚Ä¶ So disappointed
2.0,The skirt that came with these size Large (adult) jackets is smaller than any of the children's skirts size 130! A complete and total waste.
2.0,It's somewhat awkward and makes your junk look a bit odd
2.0,These look like cheap costume material. The quality is just sad.
2.0,"This dress is very comfortable, has a little slit up the side a bit.<br />At the waist this has some types of gathering in the material , that I can‚Äôt figure out how its suppose to lay, but not flattering.<br />If that is what is being called for this dress, a  ‚ÄúWrap Dress‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so.<br />The material is synthetic, and is a bit heavy, and hangs on me.<br />The bottom goes at a slant..The length I think would look better shorter, or wear heels with this! Sandels didn‚Äôt look good for me.<br /><br />I wear a size 8 or 10, and this is a size large, as it says it is a size 10. I‚Äôm thinking this is too big for me, as I look dumpy in this dress.<br />If you have a bulge it will show, as the dress is also clingy.<br /><br />Sorry but I‚Äôm not a fan, and will not wear this dress!"
2.0,They started to fray on the sides after just a few wears.
2.0,shorter than looks on line. Also materials isn't as nice as it looks on line.
2.0,"Rise on shorts seems shorter than photo.<br />If you‚Äôre looking for longer swim shorts, keep looking."
2.0,when it come to buying clothes it's always best to try them on before purchasing. whats shown online does not necessarily mean it will work as it should when worn
2.0,All of the reviews I read on this product described the durability and security of the tag holders as top-notch. What the reviews failed to note was that they don‚Äôt properly hold the luggage tags that are printed off at home. I spent at least twice as long as necessary making more folds than was required by the directions of the paper tags. I like these items but not for their intended purpose for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line luggage tags.
2.0,"The material is ok,the length is ok but the style is so weird.It also makes you look fat."
2.0,Not a good cut/style not like shown on the model. See through. Runs small. Will be returning
2.0,We knew that it‚Äôs not gonna work once you touch the material... it was too light and did not keep warm.. very disappointed
2.0,Itchy cheap fabric. sent it back
2.0,"In the picture it appears as though there is glitter or something to make it sparkle. There is not, it's just an image printed on the material. I was disappointed. I had purchased it to match an outfit that I have for a wedding I will be attending."
2.0,The pants were fine but the top was small
2.0,This coat was very thin. You get what you pay for. The coat runs very small.
2.0,The material is different then shown.  I thought like shepra soft. But its more itchy.
2.0,Love the print. But that's about it. I bought a medium cause I wear a medium to large. And they were sliding down all day. I shouldn't have to pull up legging every 5 minutes. They don't stay in place at all.
2.0,"Chain is too short, would work as a choker unless you have a weirdly skinny neck."
2.0,"...and got what I paid for: cheap. The fit is such that, rather than the nose pad sitting on my nose, the lens rests on my cheek just enough to be annoying. That alone is enough to make me send these off as a donation and order others"
2.0,It is shorter than it appears in the picture
2.0,"I was very hopeful about this dress, but it arrived as a crumpled mess. I usually wear a medium or a large and I ordered a medium and it was still much too large. The pockets didn‚Äôt lay right and all the added material in the hip area made my hips look huge. It was not flattering at all. I sent it back immediately."
2.0,"One of the metal pins was already broken in the package, but it did come with 4 of them.  The band itself was already scratched and peeling, but it isn't too noticeable yet. I do like that it is easy to adjust because my wrist swells sometimes."
2.0,"This was a cute top at a good price, when it arrive opened package and Immediately knew size was not true and too small"
2.0,This was cheap material like swimsuits and did not fit the way the size I ordered should have.
2.0,Okay looking
2.0,I wanted to love this item but the extra large clings to me (size 12 to 14 depending on item).  Will have to lose weight before I can wear it and you can see black bra through it.<br />It is a pretty color and cool design.<br />XL runs small in my opinion.
2.0,"The dress is very small.  If you are American with broad shoulders, DO NOT BUY.  Very small for a 2x.  Probably a size 10-12 in USA clothes.  Sending back."
2.0,"I got these as a lightning deal, even with the discount they weren't worth the asking price.  As others have said they look nice and are comfortable to wear, while they last!  Unfortunately these glasses are made out of a really cheap plastic material and are poorly constructed.  I wore them very little and than one day they just snapped.  It happened on the arm of the glasses, past the hinge, right after their little oval trim.  I won't be buying this brand again and suggest others pick one of the many alternatives."
2.0,wife found it uncomfortable and much smaller than a medium
2.0,Not very flattering if you have any imperfections. The material feels nice but to me it doesn't look like the shirt in the photo. It's not near as long. I won't bother returning but I probably won't ever wear it either...
2.0,The hair clip was missing from the package
2.0,"The metal quality of the jewelry is fine, but a bit pricey to risk getting and not being able to return if it's not the right diameter. I bought 18G 3/8&#34;, which was the right thickness but too big of a diameter."
2.0,Belt seems like nice quality. Picture of belt looks more Oxblood Burgundy color which is what I was after. The belt is more brown. Can any of the rachet belt companies make a good true colored Oxblood Burgundy color. I challenge them!!
2.0,Didn't fit properly and was not easy to adjust for a small wrist
2.0,"I like the way this band looks and feels, but easily becomes loose and falls off easily as well.  Not strong."
2.0,I wanted to like it. Too bad you can‚Äôt order separate sizes for the top and bottom. I am 5ft 3in and about 125lbs. I got medium and the bottoms were perfect but the tops didn‚Äôt fit well at all so I had to return. There was a gap between the electric and my rib cage. I think a small top would have fit better but I couldn‚Äôt go smaller on the bottoms.
2.0,"The hardware on the cross body strap broke in less than two weeks. It's not like I carried heavy stuff, just a wallet, phone and makeup. I liked the look but the quality isn't great. Also, there was a used hair clip in the bag which leads me to believe that maybe this was used before I got it which if that's the case is not okay."
2.0,So tiny--gave them to my 11 yo granddaughter
2.0,"Fortunately this was only purchased to be used as a prop for a photograph. If this was part of a Halloween costume, it wouldn't have made it through the trick-or-treating rounds."
2.0,They look very cheap and broke almost immediately!
2.0,"First impression, they were cute little earrings but after trying to put them in, it's apparent how cheap they are. They bend and dent way too easily. They're hard to get in. There's another brand on amazon that comes in a 3 pack and those are way better quality. The earrings will do for now but probably won't last long. I would not purchase this product again."
2.0,Not the same color as pictured
2.0,"It's stylish but not practical. The mechanical skeleton blends in with the clock hands or vice versa, making them hard to see."
2.0,Two stars for the warm cozy fabric. Ordered two pair and both have one leg that is more narrow than the other. Strange body shape fit high in the front and at the waist in the back. Extremely poor quality for fit and styling. No stars deserved except the fabric is very soft and cozy and the pockets are great.
2.0,"very lite in weight,  cheaply made, no comparison to pandora or Troll bead charms"
2.0,Runs small. I wanted to order a size up but that pair costs over 2x the price so I'm returning instead.
2.0,I usually wear a size 12 pants and I had<br />To order a 2XL in this skirt - so be wary. It‚Äôs a nice skirt... except the zipper. The zipper is bumpy and lumpy and I honestly liked the skirt until I saw this. Returning because of the awkward zipper - was a nice product otherwise.
2.0,"I am 5'2&#34; and these are not long enough in the legs. The top fits well but the neckline is very low so I always have to wear a shirt or sweater over them even inside. But, they are soft and silky so they don't bulk under clothing which is why I gave 2 stars."
2.0,The hat did not last long and the color were different shades of gray.
2.0,Fun & festive
2.0,"First impression was great. Super soft inside and out. Like regular leggings you take them out of the packaging and they‚Äôre tiny but they‚Äôre leggings they‚Äôll stretch right?! I slip my feet in and omg the buttery softness hits your skin (especially since I just shaved my legs) and whoa so comfy and warm. I was excited to like these leggings.<br />Halfway up getting super snug but again they‚Äôre leggings that‚Äôs like the whole point. A couple tugs, a few weird leg/butt wiggles to get them on, ok theyre up in the front but the crotch is still at mid thigh and the back is halfway down my butt. So I do a squat or 5 so stretch em out a little, give me some breathing room maybe then the crotch won‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm wearing a diaper...I pull the front up while simultaneously stuffing my thigh chub into the leggings. Ok we‚Äôre up, no more diaper. I have a big bubble butt so I usually half expect a rough time back there but they‚Äôre up...for now. I admire for a second in the mirror: butt looks great ok we are good. I take a few steps out of my room and feel the terrible feeling of skin touching skin. I stop adjust and go on. More friction. Adjust again and again. Now the back is creeping down but can‚Äôt pull that up without the friction returning. With every step I take the leggings ride back down and my thighs touch. If your like me with thick thighs, you know that feeling. It‚Äôs not a fun feeling after awhile.<br />The moral of this story is if you like to adjust your leggings after every couple steps and you like the crotch of your pants creeping down, then these are for you.<br />As for me, I will pass and get better leggings"
2.0,Much too small to be of use for more than a day‚Äôs grocery shopping
2.0,"These sunglasses look like something you would wear home from the eye doctor after having your eyes dilated. Large lens and the bridge keeps the glasses rather high on my nose.  The dark lens is good for bright sun, and they do wrap around so provide a better coverage of sunlight to your eyes, but overall not an attractive look or feel."
2.0,Ordered the shirt for my son he is usually a boys medium it was more like a child's medium so if you're ordering this I would definitely do it in an adult size for a teenage boy!
2.0,broke before I could give it to my girlfirend.. had to repair it myself before giving it to her.. cheap cheap cheap
2.0,I don‚Äôt like how short this shirt is and it‚Äôs wider than I care for so really it just makes me look fat which isn‚Äôt supposed to happen when the shirt is black. Nice stretchy material though. Probably won‚Äôt wear it much
2.0,"Runs short, no for tall girls I‚Äôm 5‚Äù10 I bought it size large and look short on me, I don‚Äôt like how is look on me because of that"
2.0,"It's not good quality, it's cheap too, I bought them to sell, I have to give them at a low price so as not to lose everything."
2.0,At first they were great.<br /> Then a couple weeks later I washed them and the padding on the insoles bunched up and had to toss em.
2.0,Order one size larger than the suggested size if you're curvy
2.0,"Not a huge fan of this wallet.The strap is VERY thin and doesn't seem like it will hold up/last. Also, it's just way too small for my liking... it can only fit 8 cards and they don't come out super easily. Will be returning."
2.0,"The last Hatley sleepshirt I had was a 2X, and I couldn't find anything that size, but this stated it was quite large, unfortunately it is a little small and too short.  I just WISH I could find another one like what I had."
2.0,"I am writing specifically about the Black-Silver Gray style. The construction is good but the bridge of the sunglasses are very tight and since the frame is plastic (the description states that it's metal), it is not bendable. There is a distinct line when looking through the lenses. The mirror section is darker when viewing through the lense than the non-mirrored section and obscures the field of vision. I returned them."
2.0,The watch band is kinda cheap.  Looks good enough but is flimsy.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this jacket! :( The sleeves were too short, which isn't that odd of an occurrence for me. One of the pockets want completely attached at the top (pictured). And the zipper is janky and not easy to zip up or down - especially with one hand, but even with both hands it got stuck. Still trying to decide if I'll exchange it or just return it. It's super soft!!!"
2.0,"This is actually pretty comfortable for the design.  But if you are looking for any kind of support, this is not really for you.  I was blessed with larger breasts but gravity has taken it's toll and this product doesn't really offer support for that.  I had to use body tape in addition to this product.  It does however provide coverage where it is supposed to and it is surprisingly comfortable.  I would suggest ordering a larger size because this does run slightly small."
2.0,Thought it would be a little painting<br />It is a cheap pic under plastic...:(
2.0,Too thin and flimsy.
2.0,"Ordered a small a larger than normal size and it was very tight. Also thin. Had a paper label on it. I 5""4"" and 114 pounds."
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute but not as website description, I mean  it‚Äôs probably the size for an infant, it‚Äôs very small"
2.0,"one would have been enough, but 4... who needs 4."
2.0,"This  necklace is very, very small. The chain is too little for my neck and is very fragile and cheap looking. The charm has a good message, but you are better off buying a bracelet instead!!"
2.0,"I have a small wrist.  The band fits, but there‚Äôs so much slack it actually interferes with securing my watch.  Every.  Time.  I wear the darn thing."
2.0,Much smaller than s doc at least one size smaller
2.0,I got Pashmina Olive Green Shawl as a gift. The color is not even close to Olive Green or the color on the picture! Way off! It's bright medium green. Made in China. No fabric content  - just 100% pashmina. Item description is an example of false advertising. It stated in there that it's cashmere?!!  It's not a wool - synthetics. I requested to return this shawl. Will update on the outcome.
2.0,"I was excited to buy this item. It was very cute when it arrived, however, a few hours after I put it on the chain broke. I was able to still clip the broken end to the chain and wore it for another two days. Then the bracelet just fell of my had. Over all, it is really cute, but is weak and of poor quality."
2.0,Super cute pattern and soft material but the elastic waist hits in a weird spot. Too low for me.
2.0,Elastics in the fabric break and protrude out. End up with a white line under the breast area the first wash. But a very pretty lingerie
2.0,I‚Äôm not sure if these are supposed to be like this but they are totally stiff and stick up behind my head instead lay down by my shoulders. I have tried to install them all 4 possible ways and no matter what they stick up. Like the look but don‚Äôt wear because of this.
2.0,Plus they are small. child like.  I do not like them. I will probably give them away as a freebie.
2.0,"Cute purse, but it's n well made and it came with scratches."
2.0,this broke within one week :(
2.0,"Bottoms fit perfectly. The top is made for someone that is  C cup or smaller. I loved the cut  of this and thought it would give me the coverage I was looking for. Unfortunately, unless you are part of the IBTC this will not work for you."
2.0,Unflattering cut. Fabric slouches throughout the day.
2.0,They are very beautiful but very uncomfortable.
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap. You get what you pay for. Absolutely cheap quality. Save your money and buy something of real quality.
2.0,Pants too thin
2.0,Material very thin and one of the masks were ripped upon opening.
2.0,The product was exactly as described but it fit way too big. Definitely meant for thicker women/bigger breasts and butt
2.0,"In theory it was great to have a simple band, but the latch would detach quite easily after a few months of use."
2.0,This hoody is much smaller then indicated. My daughter the usually wears a US medium. We bought this in XL since we have had this issue before with Amazon clothing. The XL fit like a very form fitting medium VERY form fitting.
2.0,"This was more like a thin sheet with a ""V"" cut in the neck. It was soft, but very thin and even the dark navy I ordered was see through. It would work for a swim cover up, but it just wasn't worth $16 to me."
2.0,Watch face is a whole lot SMALLER than what I thought it would be.  That is really disappointing for all the money I paid for the 2 sets I had ordered.  I'm thinking of returning them and looking for bigger faces through this site.  The straps are mostly okay though.
2.0,Band broke the second time I wore it. It was cheap. I got what I paid for.
2.0,I returned this dress.  The style was as expected.  I purchased a large and it fit as expected.  The material was thin and cheap.  It needed a lining.  It would have be see through.
2.0,Smells like mildew and the band is too small.
2.0,This thing is small as a dime and cheap metal.... Don't waste your money!
2.0,Nice hat but logo is the reason I bought it and others buy it. Logo is obviously a sticker.
2.0,"Got these for part of a Halloween outfit.  We had 3 break before even wearing.<br /><br />They're made extremely cheap,  save your money and don't buy"
2.0,Fits well but stretches after washing
2.0,"I followed the sizong chart, but unfortunately top is too small.I  should have ordered one size up."
2.0,"Pretty color, super cheap fabric and design. You definitely get what you pay for. The bottoms weren't too bad though, so I would definitely use them in the future with a different top. The top is cheesy as heck to me though. Lol. Also, the fringe is only on the front,  not all the way around. Maybe I'm just too old."
2.0,"I loved the sweater in the photo very much so I selected my size and when I received it, it was like putting on an extra L. It also had a box look to it, nothing like the photo showed. I won't buy from this company for tops anymore."
2.0,I've contacted the seller support and I have yet to receive a response. The suit. Is way to big.
2.0,They are plastic so they got stuck on. Very cheap
2.0,So I was under the impression that both of the glasses were suppose to turn into shades when you step outside but only one of the pairs do. I believe that these should really be explained better.
2.0,"Was so excited to tey this dress on.  It was too small.  Im a size 12, and bought an XL.  it was way to tight.  The roses are PINK. On the image, they appear to be red.  Disappointed"
2.0,feels uncomfortable.
2.0,Too small. Had to return it.
2.0,"I really like these shoes, my 3 year old son have about 3 pairs but this particular shoes says red but I am so disappointed that the actual color of this shoe is Hot Pink not Red.  Now I will have to return these."
2.0,Very skinny.  And came with 3 of one size metal pieces for install and only one if the ones I needed. Had to take off another watch band.
2.0,This was wonderful for the first three wears.  After that is lost it‚Äôs elasticity and stopped doing it‚Äôs job.
2.0,The material is nice and we like having an outside pocket but the wheels are too close together. We've used the suitcase several times and it tips over easily due to the spacing of the wheels.
2.0,Bought as a gift  Does not stay lined up along ear as expected.  It lays horizontally rather than running along the curve of the helix part of the ear.
2.0,"Some masks are unusable due to the closeness of the strap holes to the eye holes and the eye holes going across the entire mask. Once you try to put them on, the mask bends around your face and folds where the eye holes are. We ended up using these as decorations because no children could wear them comfortably"
2.0,Pants need a lining.
2.0,Too tiny!
2.0,I was super excited about this bracelet watch band.  The magnets just plain suck!  It wasn‚Äôt on 5 minutes and my Apple Watch went crashing to the floor.  Tried several more times and ultimately threw it away.
2.0,The fit is pretty tight and one side of the tiara already snapped thanks to stretching it on to my daughters head.
2.0,Vest runs small
2.0,Dress looks great  in pictures and is tight on
2.0,I wear 3x but this dress was too small I could not fit it and still have not been able too wear it
2.0,The sizing seams better for kids.
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like it not what I expected!
2.0,"I absolutely love this bracelet.  It has a casual look to it, the.colors.can go with any.color you want to wear it with.  It sort of reminds me of hippie jewlery, which appeals to me.  I only wish the butterfly  came in gold as well because I did buy that as well.  UPDATE:  Dropped this rating down to two stars because the bracelet broke after 4 days of wearing it.  Honestly, I did not have to stretch the elastic over my hand very much, so it wasn't like I was stretching it to the limit.  I was just repositioning it on my wrist and it just broke....beads went everywhere.  The two stars are for how pretty and colorful it was.  Full disclosure, the seller reimbursed the full amount to my credit card without any issues.  Kuddos for that.  I wish it was made with a stronger material, I truly loved it."
2.0,"My wife wears straw hats and this one doesn't fit. She was so disappointed- it was too small. If not for that, the hat would have been terrific. Even the bucket part doesn't fit over the head entirely, just not deep enough. Inside of the hat is a sort of drawstring function to tighten the hat. That part fits just fine- the bucket is just not deep enough."
2.0,"The photos are hard to make out, but my bag came with scuff marks all over it, and one of the handles was completely twisted.  I fixed the handle, but it just feels like I spent $60 on a bag someone else used and returned. I'd return it but I don't even want to deal with the hassle. Just a buyer beware."
2.0,VERY VERY CHEAP - but you get what you pay for!
2.0,"I wanted to like this but ended up returning the dress. I didn't like where the waistline fell, too close to the bust."
2.0,Love the shoe but my feet where still cold while i was ice fishing
2.0,"The hat may have the features listed, however it does not look like the picture on Amazon. It is actually an aluminum foil type look on both the front and back. Not going to keep this one."
2.0,Large top and small bottom.
2.0,"Pretty fabric. Arms and most other places, too small"
2.0,This dress has strangely shaped cups that make your chest look bumpy.
2.0,Bad quality. Ripped. Plastic things were broken. Used very short time
2.0,hard on the girls feet.....
2.0,This dress did not fit at all. The chest was too tight and the belly( waste area) was too big -  it pushed out like I was pregnant . I wear a 36C bra and I ordered a size 8 -  I normally wear a size 6 dress.
2.0,I got this ring as a wedding ring because the other one was  misplaced. Loved the ring the first day I got it. It was so sparkly and just like the picture! Unfortunately I wore it the next day and took it off to see my finger starting to turn GREEN. I know you get what you pay for but almost $30 just to have it turn my finger green really ticks me off. I will be calling to return.
2.0,Fit it fine mainly don't like the color it's way off from the picture
2.0,"The band is nice. The magnet for the closure is no where near as strong as other products like it. I am having to retighten the band all the time. Other bands like this that I have I only have to put it on, the magnets hold very secure."
2.0,The picture in the listing shows and states that the set I purchased would have 10 black and 10 transparent. The actual product comes with white 3.5mm plugs instead of transparent and they look stupid together so don't waste your money like I did.
2.0,I had to return these because they were not oversized as I thought they were.
2.0,The shirt was soft and true to size. The print quality was messy. Imagine someone splashing paint on shirt. (Not part of design)
2.0,Cute shirt but really small it could fit a 6 year old good delivery though
2.0,I have several Rinfit silicone rings that I LOVE  but this was a disappointment. Within two weeks the color was rubbing off. I‚Äôm a nurse but haven‚Äôt worn this while working yet. I can‚Äôt imagine it would hold up with frequently washing my hands (more than I already do) and using hand sanitizer. I will be returning this ring to get another color and hopefully it won‚Äôt be painted.
2.0,It hasn't been worn yet and the black stitching around the bottom of the skirt is coming off.  The pink rabbit doesn't match the pink of the skirt.  It comes from China so I'm not sure what I can do about it.
2.0,"This ear muff is not adjustable so if they are big on your head, they will not cover the top of your ear. The ear muff touching your ear is small and flat so they  do not wrap around your ear. The perimeter of your ear is exposed to the cold. This ear muff is simply a cover with an elastic edge wrapped around a small round metal frame with a little padding inside. The rivet holding the headband to the ear muff is exposed which make them look cheap. The embroidery is perfect and they were delivered in 2 days. I spent 32.00 for my ear muffs with 2 words on each side but they are too big so I plan on putting the covers on a pair of ear muffs that are adjustable."
2.0,"Bought a 4X for a little extra room, but it fit like a 2X around the belly.  If you're a bigger person, would go up a couple of sizes."
2.0,‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
2.0,"I love the look of these, but today half of one of the clusters fell off! I am so disappointed!"
2.0,Before buying these really check kids size ordered a 5for my granddaughter and they fit me I‚Äôm a women‚Äôs 9
2.0,"I have several of these style necklaces, and I usually love them even though they are not high quality.  But this one has frayed strings hanging out from the beading in multiple places (which makes me believe it will break at any moment).  And the main charm is broken off of it's hook.  I'm going to have to figure out a way to repair or solder it back together.  For the price I paid it isn't worth returning.  But the quality is really poor compared to some of the other similar necklaces I own."
2.0,I bought this shirt in an XXL. Normally am comfortable in an XL. And it fit too tight.So apparently if your an XL or larger you need to go somewhere else.
2.0,Very cheap made. Does not look like in the picture.<br />The fabric is very thin and a lot of wrinkles on it.<br />Not worth to spend $32.99 to get it.<br />Buy a $20 Adidas bag and you will find it's much better to build quality.
2.0,too narrow for my feet
2.0,"They are cute, but fragile. Bending to fit finger more than twice can cause a crease in the metal which leads to breaking in half. Bummer!"
2.0,The mask is smaller than pictured and doesn‚Äôt serve singing well.
2.0,Bent up!
2.0,I bought a small thinking it would fit perfect. It felt like an XL. Wanted to love but ended up returning
2.0,Nice glasses but they aren't photochromic..
2.0,They were on top of my prescription glasses and did not fit right leaving a big space on top between my face and the glasses. I do not recomend putting them with existing glasses i was afraid my glasses would get scratched
2.0,"I had to exchange this because the first one came with several spots of blue ink on the white parts, and a spot that looked like dirt. I ordered a large because I knew this runs small, and I'm still surprised at how small it was. My daughter is 5'4"" and 105 lbs. She usually takes a women's small, sometimes and XS. The large fits like a women's medium. It was only slightly large on her. It is not the usual cotton material, but a thin, slick Nylon material. The tag has been cut off of it, not by me, so I think I got a used one due to the dirt spot and no tag. I guess I would wash it as a delicate, but who knows.<br /><br />I will update my review once the replacement arrives."
2.0,The shirt fit and was OK quality. There were several lose strings and one of the sleeves was missing the ring to strap it up with.
2.0,its a really cute skirt but was to small ..has no stretch to it as described :(
2.0,Nice piece but too large and tacky
2.0,"The color is a bit different,  not comfy and broken in like the picture shows.  It's more rough stiff and the graphics are shiny and harder"
2.0,"Might be ok for small to medium, would not call this 'free size'"
2.0,"I ordered the light grey shirt with the bright blue in the sleeves and pocket (right side of picture).<br />I received the shirt on the left. The colors are nothing like pictured. I looked at all the other color options to see if i got sent the wrong one, but honestly i dont think the shirt i received is even a color option. The colors i got look disgusting with the grey color of the shirt, and i specifically wanted blue and didnt get anything even close to that.<br /><br />The shirt itself was fine, it was comfortable and fit fine. It just looks nothing at all like what i ordered"
2.0,"I had high hopes on this bra. The first one i received was somewhat defective. Where there was no strap the seam puckered too much like it wasn't sewn right. I ordered a replacement and I got someone's crusty return!<br /><br />It was badly stained with deodorant and smelled like the fruity perfume that I hated. Gave me an instant headache! üòµ‚Äçüí´<br /><br />The deodorant was embedded on the cloth, not just on the surface. The band under the boobs were bent showing signs of use. So I'm sure whoever had this before me, already wore it for hours then returned it. Gross!!! ü§Æ"
2.0,Made for thin legs.
2.0,"Returned the first one because the zipper was missing teeth and certain seams were not sewn properly leaving them open. Very cute top so I thought I would my luck try again. Just received yesterday, ordered an XL, shipped a 3XXX and once again serger seams were not done properly leaving opened seams. I love this top ,so I got my need and thread out to repair. Tighter quality control is needed."
2.0,I am soooo disappointed in the quality of these glasses...they feel vert flimsy & cheap plastic $5 frames.
2.0,I am disappointed in the color of the studs.  The only pair that is distinctive is the silver pair.  The other two look almost exactly the same.
2.0,"Too expensive for what it is. The quality seems decent. Does not have 100 loops to hold pens -- it only has 26 loops. If I had know that, I wouldn't have ordered it. I gave it to my niece for Christmas because I didn't have time to look for something else. The back half of the inside of the case is just smooth with no more loops than what you see in the pictures. You could put a box of pens in the back half, but not loose pens because they are unsecured and could fall out. Also, I don't understand why the bright, prettier cases are more expensive. I bought the black one because it was the least expensive, but it still cost too much for what it is. The only thing I like is the little gorilla charm."
2.0,This watch looks great but runs fast... About 5 minutes fast per hour. Useless for actually telling time.
2.0,"Bad smell, size large fits like a XL. The hat is too flappy"
2.0,Arrived in timely fashion...design and textile ok just not for person bought it for.
2.0,NOT the rich and pretty fabric shown online but just a garishly printed slick polyester. Almost too cheap looking to wear. The fit is generous.
2.0,Don't really care for the fit...
2.0,"at first was comfortable, but after a half hour or so i had to tighten it, before the day was over i had over 2ft of slack out the buckle and was not tight enough to keep my pants up."
2.0,Not comfortable to wear according to the kids. Thin plastic and the fangs were a little sharp. There were pieces of plastic not smooth on some of these which made them unusable
2.0,"mybe its just my eyes but beside the old fashion big frame ,those lenses made me daisy had to return them"
2.0,Cheap quality.  Doesn't rest as nicely on me as others seem to have found it to do.
2.0,"Doesn't stay in place on the wrist and the ring broke during my first wear. The rose that holds everything together is just hot glued on and fell right off. If you rig it yourself, it actually is really pretty."
2.0,Color was not even close to the picture
2.0,"It broke after like one wear.  I really loved it while it lasted.  I really don't know what happened. I wasn't rough with the product or anything.  I was just living life, and it just broke."
2.0,These didn't work for me
2.0,smelled moldy
2.0,Me dejaron el paquete en el apartamento 202 y era el 204 y de esa forma se pueden perder los productos
2.0,"It looks good, but it broke couple hours after I put it on. I had my previous anklet for years. I am afraid I won't find such a good one any more."
2.0,"Low quality in both look and feel of fabric. The fringe looks very cheap (looks like mop cords) and after only a couple of weeks pieces started falling out. I plan on trying to remove it. The arms aren't as komono-esque as I had hoped. The print is pretty, though."
2.0,"Very comfortable and supportive for a wireless bra. However, it pushes my breasts together, making it look like I have one boob growing out of the middle of my chest. Maybe a different style from the same brand will work for me."
2.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, 155, athletic build, this barely made it over my waist. I got it up to my chest and then the straps didn't fit over my shoulders. I bought the size 36, after reading many reviews on sizing and researching what I should get.<br />My waist is 28ish inches, and that part fit fine. But the chest was small and I'm 35 inches there. The hips were the tightest. It may be because I have a 40 in hip, but it still should have been able to stretch some to help with getting it on.<br />As for the material, like I said it doesn't stretch well, but it felt durable for swimming."
2.0,"I purchased this shirt for my 10yr old, the quality seems to be very cheap. The shirt was rather short and the screen print started to crack after the first wash. It really was not worth the price."
2.0,"My dress pulled it down and made it stick out on the sides, it did not look right at all.  It would not stay in place and was uncomfortable."
2.0,"I have had a few of this particular model of Casio watches over the years....or quite similar updates by them. This model...originally was an exceptional watch. Worked great....looked great...comfortable. But with each passing model update, a few more corners were cut....the quality went down. The price went up. So .....I just ordered this one....and again....the quality is way less than it use to be....and the price keeps rising. The bezel is fake...but let's live with that now. The second hand is now almost invisible....so let's write that off. You can tell the time...but surprisingly....not easily. Maybe it is the larger dots and dashes they now use instead of numbers. I am not really sure. Bottom line. This is still a decent watch. Still a timeless design. It just isn‚Äôt the same great watch it use to be.....and with a little effort.... Casio could have kept this a great watch. I guess they chose differently.<br /><br />UPDATE: Having used this watch now, I took away another star and downgraded my review. I would NOT recommend this watch....period. Who would design a watch with a practically invisible second hand....and a dark minute hand against a black watch face....with only the top of the minute hand in White for contrast. If that wasn‚Äôt ridiculous enough...in this model... Casio is using white circles and shapes instead of numbers and  has enlarged the white spots. This way when the white tip of the minute hand goes over the white marking spots....the tip of the minute hand virtually disappears. So now we have an invisible second hand with a minute hand that disappears every five minutes when it's white tip goes over a white time marker. So basically if you want to watch your ‚Äúhour hand‚Äù only, go around and around ...you might like this watch. But...compared to earlier models, this version is cheaper....not as well made...and much, much more difficult to tell the time. In my humble opinion, that is an important part of having a watch...telling time easily."
2.0,Does not lay like it shows on the picture and it turned my finger green
2.0,"This I don't even know how to review, the shoes I love however it is small.  I purchase an 11 my child wears a ten and this is way too small for her feet.  It is vibrant and even more beautiful than on the picture here on Amazon.  I really wanted my baby to have it but cannot seems to return to get a larger one."
2.0,"It had two broken zippers. It was gift for my son, but he made it work..! ‚òπ"
2.0,"Love the look and wanted this top badly!<br />Unfortunately I had to return as this top was too small. I sized up and ordered the largest size but it appears this item is made small, and it gives no stretch.<br />Large chest don't order.<br />Body type similar to picture ordering will be fine!"
2.0,"If you've got the wrist of a 10 year old boy or an 85 pound adult, this is the watch for you !  If you're a normal sized male keep looking.  I'm a big Seiko fan and there is no way this watch is ever going to fit me, or even look right on my wrist if I add 5-6 links.  I did keep it though. it'll make somebody happy in the future.  My 2 star rating is a reflection of the Amazon description and not the quality or function of the watch."
2.0,Very cheap looking and horrible fit
2.0,"I ordered the xxl and was sent a large. I am returning and reordering in Hopes of receiving the correct size. I like the style and color, I think I might love them if I could actually get them on."
2.0,"Gloves are nice quality and fit as expected. Unfortunately the gloves I received were different sizes (one small, one unlabeled but clearly larger)"
2.0,The battery is out easyly
2.0,I bought this hat a few weeks ago in preparation for my girlfriends birthday. When I gave it to her and she opened it up and the hat reeked of cigarettes. No one in my house smokes and I kept it in the plastic until I gave it to her. The quality of the hat seems fine but not thrilled at all with the awful smell.
2.0,I ordered this last year and was able to use it only a few times before the back turned dark gray and rough and caused a skin rash.Was hoping for a better quality silver band.
2.0,"I have had this wallet for less than a month, stitches are coming apart in three different locations, one location is where the Apple Tab is to be held and it will no longer stay in, which makes the wallet useless for what it was intended."
2.0,This dress is very flattering in terms of the cut but it was completely see-through. I got the blue plaid color and the outline of my bra was 100% visible through the fabric. I could have sized up for less stretch but then I would wind up with a dress that‚Äôs too baggy.<br /><br />I wound up buying the same dress in the mustard floral print and it‚Äôs too small and less see through than the blue plaid but still too see through to wear without a slip.
2.0,"Like the style, but not material--spongy like.  Colors I like.  Sizing not comparable to USA standards.  I wear a medium; however, this medium is skin tight.  Not sure if a large would work for me."
2.0,"I love the Kerrits brand, but these fit oddly!"
2.0,My jumpsuit was huge and the crotch was long. Unattractive.
2.0,"The clasp is too small this very difficult to put on the necklace, a problem when you want to change a pendant"
2.0,"This garment is well below what is acceptable -- and does not seem professionally made. It looks like a crafts project or costume for a theatrical production. Sure, it's wearable and not coming apart yet, but ooof, does it look and feel undeniably chintzy and cheaporama.<br /><br />Listing pics are pretty misleading. The skirt material is thin and quite insubstantial -- and the shorts part, literally is what linings are made of. There is absolutely no give or stretch in that part and they will surely rip to shreds. So so not what the shorts for such a skirt are supposed to be. You will not really be able to move freely in these. Just not worth it ... maybe if they came in three pack at this price, so my tween could use them post pool time at camp."
2.0,Thumb is always exposed a bit.  So not for real cold days.  Maybe it is just my hand.
2.0,The item is not made to proper sizes. I am usually a large and this extra large couldn't fit.
2.0,Snap broke at the 4 week mark of use d/t the nylon it was on tore.
2.0,"It appears as though the lights are burnt out on my hat. Unfortunately I will have to go to the store and see if new batteries will do the trick. Having said that, the hat appears to be a good quality hat. It's very nice looking."
2.0,Material was itchy. Not at all sweater like. Returned.
2.0,"Top part didn't fit well. Too boxy and fabric was rough and not comfy, very stiff. Ended up returning"
2.0,"Beautiful colors but the material is so thin it split at the seams the first time I used it.  And no, it wasn‚Äôt too small it just wasn‚Äôt well put together.  It‚Äôs a shame because it was beautiful"
2.0,Definitely for a longer torso (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù) Fabric was not great and a little thin.
2.0,"I was looking for a purse that was a wallet, phone holder and had enough space for chapstick. I looked at the more luxury brands but can‚Äôt fathom spending that kind of money on a purse so when I found this I was so excited. However, my phone (iphone 12) - although it did fit was very tight in the phone compartment. I have a ring on it so I know that adds to the thickness but it was VERY snug. I was able to fit the contents of my wallet and chapstick inside but again everything was very snug. The first time I tried to get my ID out of the compartment it took FOREVER because the purse was bulging. The snaps aren‚Äôt easy to snap and unsnap and then one day I was opening it and the whole compartment with my ID ripped so I had to throw away. If you are just putting in a few cards and your phone this may work but I have purchased a different purse from Amazon that is ten times better in al the ways this purse failed."
2.0,I don't know who these are supposed to fit but they are tiny! I generally wear size small and just about everything and ordered these in the medium and they are ridiculously tight and small and short. I honestly could not squeeze into them. Maybe if I tried for a good 20 minutes I could get these on but who wants to do that? The quality feels very nice and silky and there's definitely a good amount of compression in the waist which could be nice but again these are just really tiny.
2.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up to get a baggier look and they look awful! I think they are cut to be form fitting and they look strange if you try to wear them loose. Two stars for the quality of the denim. If you are very tall, thin and looking for a form fitting overall,maybe these would work for you."
2.0,"Very comfortable.  Only one problem,  the right slipper was obviously used because their was a stain and scuff on the toe.  Returned for a refund."
2.0,"Needs to be more clear about sizes, when I ordered a large I figured I would get an adult large but I am not sure if it was even big enough to be a children's large."
2.0,the material wasn't what I expected and it was missing a button on the neck piece. sent it back and wont reorder.
2.0,The hat itself is very well made. The only issue I had was how cloudy the shield was. I could barely see through it to walk through the house and there was no way my child could wear that at school. Will be returning.<br /><br />*I did try washing the shield and after it dries it goes right back to being cloudy
2.0,"The dress isn‚Äôt terrible, but the fabric is much thinner & cheaper than I thought it would be. It‚Äôs kinda like thin & slicky almost. Like it makes a noise when it rubs together or touches something, if that makes sense. Not at all like a nice cotton or other fine fabric would feel/sound/look. Also, the floral print didn‚Äôt look as nice in person as it did in the picture. Again, kind of a cheap look. The dress fit, but not as nicely as other things do. It wasn‚Äôt too big or small, it just didn‚Äôt lay as smoothly as it should in some places. Maybe not sewn exactly right. I returned it for these reasons and also because it looked a lot dressier on me than I thought it would. Could maybe be good for a party or something, but not for just work or a casual event."
2.0,"The bracelets were delivered on time. However, in my opinion, only 5 or 6 are actually pretty ""decent"" . The others aren't...looks cheap and childish. These bracelets will not last long. They are also tiny and does not flatter your wrist ... Will need to stack them with other higher quality bracelets to achieve a fuller look. Would not buy again."
2.0,The band is so pretty! It is so shiny and sparkly! It is lightweight and very fluid. I love that you don't have to remove pins to size it!<br />The downfalls to it are...<br />It does not match my watch face. I have the 42mm Galaxy watch and the band is a pink rose gold color.  I didn't even wear the band for 3 hours and one of the rhinestones fell out!  The prongs where it was stabbed my arm and snagged on everything! I wouldn't waste your money.
2.0,The color was not as it appears. The size fit everywhere but through the shoulders. Not sure if it was the design or not.
2.0,the balls are barely held on I was hoping they screwed on but they are just pinched in there if ring flexes you loose the ball would not recommend
2.0,This broke quickly
2.0,"The came with a crack at the nose peice  and seem flimsy. Looks good, but had to send them back."
2.0,"These are cute no doubt...but the necklace came in one loop, the lobster claw was just stuck on the chain and not attached to an end, because there was no end. I had to cut it and add a jump ring and a new connecter because the lobster claw wouldn't close once it was opened. The elephants are going the wrong direction, they are attached to the back vertically instead of horizontally as they should be. Why? Why would you have them go on head to tail when they should be back to feet?"
2.0,completely see through ..fabric is sooo thin its like crepe paper..looks and feels very cheap.
2.0,Material wasnt all that great and it was quite tight fitting
2.0,"The  sleepwear was really cute...not too heavy. Fabric not as soft as expected...a little harsh. Unfortunately, the sleeves of the sleepwear were VERY tight and uncomfortable...if not impossible...to get on. Pants had slightly more room but  not by much. Very disappointing for my little guy!"
2.0,"Odd fit, too big from the shoulders. Fabric was not what I expected"
2.0,Wouldn‚Äôt order
2.0,"Beaver of the way this band is made, small wrists aren‚Äôt great with it.  We bought it for me 6 year old and it had so much excess we ended up having to cut a ton off so it would actually fit under the band like designed"
2.0,"Runs very small, I‚Äôm a size M sometimes L, ordered XL and still fits snug. Money wasted"
2.0,Top very soft. Pants very rough. I have a body itch from a chronic disease and the pants would be very uncomfortable. Returning
2.0,5 sizes to small
2.0,".The breast part was very sticky bit the ears to hold it up were less sticky and would not stay adhered.  The reason I gave comfort a 2, is because I was unable to use them as they would not stay stuck, but I feel had they worked they would have been comfortable.  Maybe okay for smaller volume breasts."
2.0,"Thin, scratchy material, ordered a large and it was too small for me. I am a size 10-12 US so it should have been fine. Not worth $50"
2.0,Even an XL is super small.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:8ab319cc2ffe34db352ae4a2701192b5]] The other rings are fine no tarnish and still silver, the butterfly one does stay in quite well, it does kind of poke your nose when it accidentally moves out of place. It also tarnished after a few weeks."
2.0,"Understanding from the description that it would be form-fitting, I was still in shock when I saw the dress. This was beyond body-con in terms of tightness - it appeared to be mis-sized. I had to return it, as the slit was so high it was at underwear level."
2.0,I don‚Äôt like giving poor review but these really hurt my ears! The latch is super thick and closes too close to your ear lobes. They were super cute though but only wore once
2.0,Poor quality- does not look like picture.
2.0,"Neck was way larger than any other 15.5"" shirt that I've worn before."
2.0,"Clasp broke on day 3, Lost the bracelet in the lake as it fell off my wrist"
2.0,Missing silver shiny thing
2.0,"Bring of the hat is falling apart, hat to glue it back together, hat is small for my head, I'm a medium average size."
2.0,"The hoodie fit more like a 4XL, what concerned me most was the material felt thin and wasn‚Äôt very heavy. I return the garment without problem because I need a much heavier hoodie"
2.0,"Gloves are nice.  They fit well, comfortable, and can use on touch screen.  Just what I was looking for.  However they have a horrible fishy smell.  I thought maybe because they were new and in package.  I hung them up to air out.  No such luck.  The smell is bad.  Unfortunately I will be returning them"
2.0,Shirt was beautiful and a large fit perfectly but whoever sewed the buttons on put them about a half inch higher than the button holes so the front material did not hang even at the bottom when buttoned. One of my worst pet peeves. The shirt was buttoned and pressed before packaging so there is no way they would not have noticed it. It was a gift so didn‚Äôt see it until the person wore it.
2.0,It had a stain on it when I received it :(
2.0,I purchased the same company's bathing suit a year ago and it fit perfectly. I ordered this suit but when it came it was definitely not the same length. I'm very disappointed for sure. Sent it back and waiting for my refund :(
2.0,Do not like the material at all! Feels cheap.Cute colors though.
2.0,"Very comfy, soft and warm, beautiful blue shade. BUT, they started coming apart almost immediately. There‚Äôs now blue fluff covering all floor surfaces around my apartment. Would not recommend due to poor quality. I‚Äôve had less expensive slippers last longer."
2.0,"This stuff is mostly junk. Plastic crap that will end up in a landfill within 2 weeks of play. Everything breaks. The axe snapped off just as my son was swinging it. The water gun/extinguisher stopped pumping properly after 2 weeks of regular use. Flashlight still works though. And I guess the whistle is fine. My favorite part of this kit was the plastic zipper bag that held the toys, makes for a great to go bag for diapers and lotions, etc.<br /><br />Still, I think these toys are literally destroying the Earth."
2.0,This seems like a well made bag. Sturdy canvas with leather trim.  I thought the bag was going to be smaller than it actually is.
2.0,Need to order a couple of sizes bigger than what you wear
2.0,The elastic was damaged soon
2.0,"Way too big, I cannot see around me"
2.0,"Wasn't a firm belt, rolled over. Cheap quality."
2.0,"I've ordered these shorts serveral times in the past.  I was very satisfied with the thickness of the fabric and the amount of stretch.  My latest order is a different product.  The fabric is much thinner, there is not as much elasticity and the fit is different.  I will not be ordering these again."
2.0,Bag was very small lucky if u could get make up in it
2.0,I walk 2 miles a day and its below freezing. And by the end of my walk my hands are very cold with thes gloves being reviewed. Note there is no Thinsulate tag like on my old falling apart gloves in the picture. The gloves in my picture are infinitely warmer than the gloves I am reviewing. I know the ad says Thinsulate but I am skeptical as they are not that warm and no Thinsulate tag. Just my opinion.
2.0,It more reminds me of a cut up garbage bag than a skirt.  Not that flattering.  My gf wasn't a fan.  She's got a booty and it actually made her butt look like pancakes.
2.0,Not sized proportionately.  Gaps under arms
2.0,"Fell off my bed to the floor and the minute hand stuck to the hour hand and they would try to move together , but that was the death of it , Gave it two stars for the feel of it and looks but the overall durability is not there , I had only had it a week when it happen"
2.0,"Of course for the price, it is cheaply made. However, this product didn't last through the first use. A bracket underneath snapped during my first pin removal. I'd steer clear of the product. I gave it a 2 for the price being as low as it is, otherwise I'd give it a 1."
2.0,Broken within 5 min of getting it unfortunately.
2.0,It's smaller than I expected. Looks good but I'm limited to what I can carry in it.
2.0,Would have been cute if you couldn't see where the lining met the sheer overlay. It's an awkward gap between the two and it looks cheap. Will not buy again.
2.0,Very big for a newborn
2.0,These are TINY. I would not consider them adult socks.
2.0,Was surprised that this didn't fit like typical swim trunks.  My grandson was actually embarrassed to wear it.
2.0,The size I ordered did not match the measurements that was listed on the website. I will be returning it.
2.0,This dress does not fit everyone as advertised. It is super small and doesnt have much stretch to it
2.0,Was nice until after not even wearing it for a week the ball fell off
2.0,"I went by the comment section for the first time, said these rompers run small. I'm 5'7 174 lbs and usually wear a medium. Some of the comments also said not enough stretch and since it's jean I assumed it would be tough material and decided to go a size up. Ordered a Large, package came on time. Tried it on and was a little disappointed. In fact it is very stretchy, way too baggy in the midsection and the ankle cuffs look like bell bottoms. When I came back here to check could see she inserted the ankle cuffs inside her shoes smh. Had I seen it as I received it, probably would not have ordered it. Anyway, contacted seller so I can return/ exchange and was told the new one will ship out to me after 20 days. Wayyyyy to long and can not understand why, decided to just give away."
2.0,"It looks too strange to wear. I actually really like the collar and neckline of the shirt, it's very flattering. The fabric feels a bit strange, but I think it would at least look ok once I got all the creases out. However, I put it on several times trying to figure out why it looks so bad and I finally figured it out. Part of it is that with the drop shoulder design, having gathers in the sleeves where it joins the shoulder makes it look odd. But, more than that, it's that the sleeves are double layered and the rest of the shirt is not. This makes these dropped shoulder, puffy gathered sleeves a super opaque and solid white while the rest of the shirt is kind of on the more sheer side. Having a solid body and sheer sleeves is ok, but the revers is not a good look at all.<br /><br />There may be people who like this style, so if you do you might like this shirt. However, I think it would look better to have the body and the sleeves either all opaque or all sheer. I usually avoid wearing white under a white shirt because of how obvious it is, but I'll find a pure white cami or tank to try underneath and see if I can get the rest of the shirt to look more like the color of the sleeves. Otherwise, I won't wear it."
2.0,Left too much gap under the glasses almost as if the arch isn't high enough.
2.0,It's not actually as pretty as pictured.
2.0,The sleeves are too long and puffy. The buttons at the cuff look cheap.
2.0,Love the size and pattern. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt hold up very well. I have had them for 2 months and they are ripping. I do not put anything heavy in them. It‚Äôs impossible to get through to customer service. They post that they are a USA company but they are definitely not.
2.0,"The material is very thin, doesn‚Äôt look thick like photo. And the length is way to long"
2.0,"I wasn't expecting an open design without anything to cover the face; in theory any bump into hardly anything at all could break the hands right off. Also there is a battery that comes in it, but it isn't any good. I haven't tried to open the back yet as I have concerns about doing so due to the overall quality and integrity of the watch. Reasonable priced for what was expected, however I anticipated being able to get some use out of it and now don't know if I can. Will likely return if the cost to do so is worth it."
2.0,These are fun but strangly put together. Half the back pieces are fixed to the bar there for the disc with the print is the on to screw off... Making putting them in a chore
2.0,Good to workout
2.0,"They were too small for me, which is fine because other people may like it, but some were so small that the jewelery became impossible to put in and take out."
2.0,Not true too Size. Runs very small..
2.0,Not what I thought I would be getting. Dissatisfied
2.0,The colors do not match on 6/8 earrings. I am so disappointed in this product and I want my money back. The purpled are two different tones and textures! I was so excited about the product and it sucks that I‚Äôm only able to wear two pairs- also size runs small.
2.0,it's just OK
2.0,Purple one made my daughter‚Äôs very sensitive skin break out and itch. Fit the Fitbit inspire just fine though.<br /><br />Updated: the blue one made my sons skin break out really badly too üò¢
2.0,"The material of the dress is much more similar to a Halloween costume. I like the fit but the material seems very cheap, I want to buy cheap but not look cheap!!"
2.0,I did not see any indication that these pants were in short lengths. Do not buy these if you are looking for regular or long length pants. I was disappointed to see that they fit but went up to my ankles...
2.0,"Was excited to get this, but I did not like the fabric or fit once I tried it on. Though, it appeared well made. I have a large chest and hips for my frame, and a small waist. The shirt was very tight across my chest and hips, but baggy around my waist. It was very unflattering. It may work better for someone with a more straight build.  Also, heads up that the sleeves are very tight. I returned the item."
2.0,The ones in the store actually worked. Disappointing this does not work and really dont want to go throught he hassle of returning.
2.0,"Product look great, but they earrings themselves break too easily. Have gone through 2 sets of these and they all ended up breaking when barely securing then"
2.0,came on time but giving it two stars because the shirt in the photo appears to be white but upon receiving it is actually PINK. pretty bummed.
2.0,Super hot bathing suit but Large should be Medium super tight!
2.0,"the top fits nothing like the picture, may want to order couple sizes larger."
2.0,"Cute fess, but it fits too small in the chest area."
2.0,"I gave it 2 stars because I really loved the color of the dress. But if you want this dress be ready to show some serious skin, including side boob and I have small boobs! The skirt underneath is super short, doesn't cover anything. I'm 5'9&#34;, this dress doesn't work at all."
2.0,Way too big. Super cute though. Debating if I want to send it back for a smaller size because I hate the hassle.
2.0,"the scarf was a little cheaply made, did not like the material, it's not silk? will not tell anyone that love mossio scarf to purchase this one"
2.0,"Looks good, feels good...but the zipper on the smaller pocket is really cheap.<br /><br />Broke down in less than 1 week of use."
2.0,Material not what I was expecting and extremely too big.
2.0,"Very thick as described, but turned out to be too much material and not at all flattering. Not great for my pear shape, skirt a little too short and no flare or shape to balance things out. Fit overall as expected (ordered 2 sizes larger than my normal size based on other reviews) but a little loose in the waistline.<br /><br />If you are looking for leggings to wear under casual dresses and tunics I highly recommend the Maidenform Flexees Women's Shapewear leggings instead."
2.0,Way to small...more like a child size than juniors.
2.0,"Exactly the belt I was looking for, great style and fit but it broke after 3 uses. Disappointed as I really do like it!"
2.0,Not as nice as pictured
2.0,"I got is very fast, its water proof and snaps open flat to use for a tarp but the seams are very crappy the hood ripped off in 5 secs and the sides ripped in 1 mile of hiking. I spent less on a better poncho ($4.00) and am much happier with the cheaper one."
2.0,This looks trashy. The fabric feels icky and not breathable. I feel like a circus clown in this dress.
2.0,Love the color.  Good size. No leakage. The sprayer died within the first month on all three. Used with a vinegar based essential oil cleaner.
2.0,Material is thin and clingy.
2.0,"These sunglasses are very cheap, and I don‚Äôt mean inexpensive ‚Äì I mean cheap. You could get a better pair of sunglasses at the Dollar General. They are not worth the current price. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre worth a maximum of $7-8. If you‚Äôre the type who keeps sunglasses on hands because you lose yours a lot, then these are probably good ones for you, but if you like good quality sunglasses, these aren‚Äôt worth it. The material feels like super cheap material and the sunglasses themselves feel like someone put a tinted screen over a lens, and not even a good tinted screen. They barely provide enough coverage on a cloudy day, much less a sunny day. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 1 star is because I would probably pay some money for these, but definitely not the current amount they‚Äôre selling for."
2.0,"Besides being too large, it looked very dated.  Design across the item all round created a great many gathers that, in my opinion made it too much looking like wrinkles at first glance.  I ended up returning the item.  There was no problem with the vendor in the return."
2.0,"Although a good looking flip flop, it does run somewhat small and once you put the shoe on, the memory foam automatically goes go the bottom; absolutely no comfort.  Not recommended."
2.0,"I didn't realize you were supposed to hand wash these, who has time for that? And we have animals so the pants are now covered in hair. They do seem to fit true to size and are comfy"
2.0,I ordered these because they are supposed to be wide....they are anything but. In fact these are more narrow than regular.  Unless they sent a non wide version because I don't see any wide or 4e labels.  Ehh....the search continues. If you have any questions of your wide foot status don't even bother with these they won't work.
2.0,"I am so disappointed. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and ordered a size up, but I didn't see that the sizing is ONLY for the length.. The waist is all the same! Who does that? Why not list as hem length rather than S,M,L, etc. The skirt itself is beautiful and if my waist were 24-26 inches, it would fit perfectly. Do not buy this if you wear larger than a size 2/4 in pants. :("
2.0,There‚Äôs not one bit of tan marbled in these sweatpants as pictured. I understand that tie dye turns out differently every time but these are just red/burgundy tie dye not the red/brown/tan as pictured. I‚Äôm disappointed.
2.0,Missing the loops to hang the bags :(  Large size bag though to carry a lot.
2.0,"Cute dress, but the fit was off. It was too small."
2.0,I bought these to use while I Jazzercise. My hair is growing out and I can't pull it back in a ponytail yet. I had to stop several times to put the headband back in place. I have decided to just go back to wearing a hat when I exercise. They are cute headbands but for what I was doing they don't stay in place on my small head. Going to have to try something different.
2.0,The shirt is cut off at the bottom so it more a belly shirt than a shirt. Very disappointing.
2.0,not happy its to wide in the pants poket hard to get out of the pocket
2.0,"I'm a huge fan of Theraderm products, and use the ops gel daily; however this did not live up to quality their other products. It had a watery consistency and left an oily layer on your skin. Too bad... I was really excited to try this!"
2.0,Broke as soon as it was taken out of the bag!!!
2.0,I didn't like the clinginess of the material - accentuates  my back rolls.
2.0,"Nowhere near as long as it looks in the picture, but the fabric and color are nice."
2.0,"Terrible quality on the sewing on this tank.  It's fabric that is cut and the edges are simply serged.  There is no fold over on the edges so the edges are thin.  The fabric rolls under on the straps and looks cheap even before washing.  In addition, the I followed the size chart and the cut is weird.  While it fits my bust, the armholes flare out awkwardly rather than slouching downward.  There is an excessive of fabric in this area also making for a very unflattering fit.  The straps are also very long so I would not recommend for anyone under 5'3&#34; because you will pop out of this tank in the front and sides.  I did give it 2 stars as the print quality and design are wonderful.  I definitely would not wear this outside the house given the other flaws."
2.0,First pair I receive was way too big and the replacement pair still did not fit
2.0,Fits wider instead of longer. Very casual.
2.0,"The fit and color were as described, but the material was a bit strange. Reminded me of a shower curtain, so I returned it."
2.0,I must remember to use my tape measure for styles like this bc it was so tight on my upper tummy it hurt. Boobies fit perfectly.
2.0,The socks for comfortable. I purchased this brand from Bass Pro Shop but when I ordered the socks they seem to have a much more delicate toe pocket and the Sox have not lasted. I literally only wore them once before my toenail poked a hole through the front. I keep my toenails trimmed and none of my other Sox have this problem. Neither did the pair that I bought from Bass Pro
2.0,"Cute dress,  but material is very thin."
2.0,"I bought this bag and I liked the feel of the leather.  However, I USED THE ZIPPERS INSIDE THE PURSE TWICE AND IT CAME COMPLETELY APART!  I was very disappointed with this!  The pockets are just open and it feels like nothing is separated. üòü"
2.0,"i bought this ring for my 10year old great neice.  Not only is it rather put together in a way that is really hard to tell it is a mermaid, the figure is way too large for her finger making it look really weird.  Actually, it looks odd on my finger.  i am wanting to return it but do not see that option.  Am i missing somethng?"
2.0,Cute but broken when arrived
2.0,Fuzz balls after 2 washing material is not cotton
2.0,"My normal size is 3x- I ordered a 4x- it is somewhat small, so I won't be able to wear it.  I will not be ordering from this line again."
2.0,The stripes on the one I received were  pretty awful. They were crooked. The white is pretty sheer as well. It's a cheap dress so wasn't expecting a lot but couldn't live with the crooked front stripes on this one. Returned it. (I did have a friend who ordered one and hers was okay so probably a hit and miss thing.)
2.0,"The fit is fine, the red is pretty, but the material is some weird, cheap, shiny rayonish blend. Can't wear it on its own, only under something else."
2.0,It was way too small. The material was nothing like the ad. I threw it away. Wouldn‚Äôt even give it away.
2.0,Quality of product has gone down...thinner material...
2.0,It was good out of the package but the whole thing is flimsy. Didn't last a month.
2.0,It was a size 12 every where but in the bust. It was VERY tight for a size 12
2.0,"Very pretty, but Very Tiny."
2.0,Would have been cute if it was made for a curvy person. More like a Tunic.
2.0,The arrow head keeps coming off.
2.0,"The product was cheaply made.  When I received it, it already had a dent in it.  Lights are working for the moment. I think it was a little high priced for the quality."
2.0,Legs are very wide and waist small in proportion
2.0,Disappointed! The zipper broke before even try the skirt .
2.0,"I'm a Patty Boutik fan and I've ordered numerous items from them but this one was a miss. The colors are bright and beautiful, but the waist line hits weird where the seam cuts, the contrast in color throws off your shape and I'm curvy, but it makes me look shapeless."
2.0,The lens are like the ones at the dollar store.
2.0,The plastic around the lens broke without any external cause
2.0,I bought this without reading the product information carefully and forgot to check the reviews. It looks good in the picture but looks very cheap in he hand. Definitely not worth the price they are charging.
2.0,nothing like the picture very disappointed...
2.0,Upsize your order if you want them to fit.
2.0,Cheap & for teeeeeny tiny heads.  No adult can fit this.
2.0,Alittle baggy but love the print
2.0,"I‚Äôm roughly 10/12. These are tight with NO STRETCH whatsoever. Like, to even sit and get in and out of my vehicle. 2/10"
2.0,Amazing grip but I wore them down in 3 days stocking shelfs at Walmart. They do not breathe at all and will make your hands smell like feet
2.0,Poor fit and construction make slippers wearable for a couple of hours and I usually kick them off at first opportunity. I won't make the mistake of buying them again.
2.0,Looked like expensive glasses but one of the nose pads was broken when I received these glasses.
2.0,"I like the style, material.<br />But size is an issue.<br />I usually order L<br />But L is too big , M probably would fit better."
2.0,"I ordered this for myself (I am a size 12/14) and there is no way I could even begin to put this on.  My daughter, who is a size 3 in juniors wears it.  Buyer beware!  The sizing is really off!"
2.0,"Seams started coming out before the return window closed, so I sent it back. Otherwise was nice."
2.0,"I ordered the pink skirt, but when it arrived it‚Äôs between a mauve/ rust red.<br /><br />Is this the correct color or should it look more like a champagne Pearl pink?"
2.0,"Well, guess what this ain't it. The picture looks amazing like it should but the actual product is not a nice dodger blue its more of a machined washed faded blue with hints of ""I should have not but this product"". Ahhh the disappointment the shame it lingers like a wet fart but however. It would have been so bad if I would have picked this item up from a swap meet for let's say for half the price. But sadly I did not, I'm confused whether to keep it or return it."
2.0,"I gave this bead as a gift to a friend and just saw it this past weekend. What a disappointment. While the bead is the same size as an authentic Troll bead it has none of the luminous, artistic flare of my real Troll beads. The glass itself is flat and the gold infusion is all stuck on one side of the bead and looks almost plastic and definitely lop-sided. Not happy and will not buy another bead on-line when I can instead buy on I have actually seen. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but I expected better and was truly surprised at the unattractive, poor quality of this bead."
2.0,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my mother. The earnings seemed okay, if a little overpriced, but the box they came in was very crummy. It‚Äôs not the velveteen box shown in one of the photos, but the ribbon covered one shown later on. The box looked homemade and, in fact, broke when my mother tried to open it the wrong way. It made the gift look cheap. I was embarrassed to be giving it. Wish I‚Äôd returned this."
2.0,"Just a cheap and crappy product. The material was so scratchy I could barely stand to wear it five minutes. Crooked seams, bad embroidery."
2.0,"Perfect example of getting what you pay for here. The shirts have actual tags on the backs of the neck! Who does that these days? These tags, are the MOST bothersome things you will experience in your day to day operations. Removing said tags, is IMPOSSIBLE to do without destroying the ‚Äúintegrity‚Äù of the shirt. The shirts are also unexpectedly short. I ordered a 3X. I don‚Äôt typically wear a 3X, but I wanted an undershirt that was tall enough to stay tucked in. These aren‚Äôt available in the tall variety, so I ordered a size too big. Can‚Äôt wait to trash the other 2 after I wear them once"
2.0,Dective product
2.0,"Pretty nice set of gloves. The 3 bar battery drops to 3 bars almost immediately but 2 bars seems to last long enough. A bit hard to adjust while riding but no big deal.<br />Tips of fingers aren't heated but palm and back are. Overall makes the ride very tolerable. Customer service doesn't reply to emails :/<br /><br />Update: gloves warm unevenly, have used them about twice. Still no reply from their email customer service<br /><br />Last update, after non existent customer service, ended up returning these for poor quality and low battery life. Good idea, but horrible execution.<br />Def do not recommend"
2.0,"I bought this for my husband's birthday. He generally wears XL, sometimes just L. Some reviews mentioned that the shirt ran small, so I ordered XXL. It is too snug in the shoulders for him to wear, and because I bought it in advance of his birthday, the return window has closed. Very disappointed."
2.0,"Such a nice quality, but brim hangs down so far I have no idea how anyone would see. Fits my head nicely (""One Size""),  but can't even see from under the brim tipping my head way back. Sadly returning."
2.0,Top came in grey/white rather than white and black like in the picture. Material is also very deceiving...more rough like canvas material than in the image. The small fit great but the ties are very wide and long unlike most tops like this that have thinner ties.
2.0,I received my order today 4 of the pins do not I repeat do not look as pictures oh my so ugly the other ones where much cuties and I like them but oh man the other ones where not that great looking üòê
2.0,This is a screened hat. Looks cheap. I won't be wearing it
2.0,Very small mask- would fit a child
2.0,"I like this, but the price is crazy high. Can get this in China town for 25 bucks. You live you learn."
2.0,"Hat is poor quality, stitching seems well made. Not sure that I would purchase again."
2.0,"Good material, sizing was very off. Ran small."
2.0,"These are some of the best-looking Steampunk glasses I've seen.  But the lenses are so dark it's actually dangerous to drive wearing them.  Forget wearing them inside or using them for cosplay; worn inside you become blind.<br /><br />From what I can tell, the lenses are made from &#34;dark black&#34; plastic... then have the reflective covering over them.  The reflective covering would have been enough to serve as sun glasses. The dark plastic makes them virtually unusable.<br /><br />It's a shame.  These are great-looking glasses.  But the truth is one simply can't see through them well enough to enjoy them."
2.0,"Although roomy, the hems all around are too tight - wrists and bottom"
2.0,Touch screen does not work which is the whole purpose of me buying it in the first place. Otherwise it just a regular glove.
2.0,"I usually stay away from Hanes but a friend said they had improved their quality so I took a chance.  Bad mistake, it cost me $9.38 to send these back as the seller said it was not his fault they didn't fit, so much for standing behind what you sell.  I ordered the large as the web site said they would fit 36-38 waist.  I have a 37&#34; waist so it seemed I was in the sweet spot.  These obviously run small because they were so tight it was uncomfortable and the wide waist band rolled over very easily making them even more uncomfortable.  If you order these go at least one size larger and be aware of the waist band roll."
2.0,did not like fabric outershell
2.0,"These are see thru footless tights, not leggings. And certainly not wool lined. There is no way my daughter can wear these unless it's under a skirt, dress or shorts. I did give them 2 stars since they do seem to be good quality but not what I was expecting to receive."
2.0,"it runs very small and being rayon , it will shrink when washed. SOOOOO will be returning and will not buy from the company again since it's impossible to really tell true size . i would say an XL is really a medium !!"
2.0,"I don‚Äôt know if it is just smaller than the size it says or cheap material, but you can see through it. My son wears 18-24 months, I got 24 and it is sooo tight and see through."
2.0,"I do not like how the reflection catches your peripheral vision, hard to wear these driving."
2.0,It was cute but way too small for my 6 year olds head
2.0,"Your socks had a whole in it on the very first time I tried to put them on. So, I cannot in good conscience give you a good review! Also the website you listed on the card enclosed with the socks did not exist and maybe still doesn't exist!!"
2.0,First day I got it it all ready wore off the rose gold color
2.0,The black framed glasses are great.  The nose pads on the other glasses have a nasty chemical odor and cannot be used.
2.0,I went up a size and it's still to small!
2.0,"I bought these because, at 35 weeks pregnant with my 4th child, my legs were aching so badly that I *couldn't* sleep at night.  Up to this point, I have gotten by with $15 knee-high compression stockings, but I decided to give these a try based on their positive reviews, and because I now need thigh high compression stockings, but don't want to spent $90 a pair for just a month of use.  I ordered the same amount of pressure I'd had with my cheap-o knee-highs (15-20 mmHg).<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I'm disappointed.  These might work for other people, but they definitely don't work for me.  They don't provide nearly the compression of my cheaper stockings, and the gripping dots at the top of my thigh to hold them in place left awful red marks and were painful when I went to remove the stockings.  I had very high hopes for these, but I will be sending these back.  :("
2.0,The material is very tarp-like it's not really a cloth fabric. But the color is very vibrant.
2.0,Too small. Huge cameltoe
2.0,This is a one size fits all and I‚Äôm a small so stressing the seams was not an issue however the bodes and skirt seam came apart after one use ‚òπÔ∏è
2.0,"I brought more of these in other colors, slate and brick. The slate colored and brick fit  more loose and beautifully flows away from your body from under your bust so it  gives good shape. For some reason the oatmeal has a diff feeling like more stiff and cut sewn in a way that is not forgiving, just look at my mommy belly and weight lose excessive loose  skin  bulges, not flattering. I tried to make it look cute by tying a knot by taking out the pocket and rolling it into a ball, just don't like to do returns will keep I guess. I will post pics of this similar dress  in diff colors so you can see the difference."
2.0,"Something about the product just seems off compared to the model picture. Looking at the picture with the model it looks as if the sleeve should have twice as many lines as the body but if you look at my picture it's the same amount. If you look at the collar on the model it looks substantial enough to lay flat but if you look at my picture the collar is rolled up and even with an iron I couldn't get it to lay flat, it's too thin and small.<br /><br />Sizing for me was off too. I'm 6'3 275 lb. I ordered an XL hoping it would fit tight on my arms and a little loose around the belly like other reviews had mentioned, but no luck. At my size I can't ever imagine an xl being big but this one is loose everywhere."
2.0,These are very cute in picture. But that‚Äôs it. If you have thighs and a butt this is not for you. The slits go up pretty high and the fabric is cheap. I felt naked most of the day. I tore them just pulling them up and I wanted these to work for me so bad.ordered a large.
2.0,They Are cut small.  I fit adequately into a 36&#34;waist
2.0,From a far the outfit looks cute but the costume literally was falling apart. The costume will have to be resewn. I‚Äôm disappointed.
2.0,First off these kept sliding all day after about an hour's wear. They ran very quickly while attempting to pull up the skirt didn't have any issues but somehow the stockings ran - and the run spread very quickly - I keep clear nail polish on hand to stop runs but I didn't have time with the speed this one spread.<br />They were also very uncomfortable at the open toe with the gathering that goes between the toes. Not a fan of these and wouldn't recommend and won't repurchase this brand.
2.0,"The band arrived with a broken fastener and doesn't fit exactly right. But instead of returning, I just used one from my old band. On the plus side, I got to keep wearing my 15+ yr old watch"
2.0,"This review is based on the jeans ONLY, not the seller - that has been very fair, with timely shipping.<br /><br />Unless you have VERY SKINNY &#34;chicken legs&#34;, these jeans are FORM FITTING, you will likely have no excess thigh/calve room. If you are seeking FORM FITTING Jeans - then these are 5-STAR Jeans. They also stretch a bit. You know muscle shirts, well these could be muscle jeans:)<br /><br />This fit is NOT what I was anticipating. Sadly there is no separate rating for quality, that is 4-5 Stars."
2.0,The word niece is only partially on the charm. It is nothing like the photo.
2.0,"Summary:<br />Quality is indicative of the price. May not fit very small/narrow, rectangular glasses. May not look good on people with small faces and heads. The plastic is rough, so if you have delicate lenses/frames, take care. I think they work for people with oval glasses shaped similar to the sunglasses and those with medium to larger faces.<br /><br />Details:<br />I think they look better online than they do up close, where you can see that they are not particularly well made, e.g., remnants of glue, flashing. But what do you expect for $14? That wouldn't bug me so much because I was just going to use them as backups in the car, but they didn't really cut the glare enough for me nor did they fit. The measurements of my glasses fell well within the range to fit these sunglasses (I have a very small face and wear kids' glasses!); however, as mine are rectangular and have a narrow bridge, the sunglass bottoms just rested against the front of mine instead of cocooning them and hung precariously from the top outside corners -- essentially leaving a huge gap in between the sunglasses and mine. To make matters worse, They come out so wide on the sides of my face, they look like gag glasses on New Year's Eve. Maybe I missed the small print that says your glasses should have the oval shape or wide bridge?"
2.0,Very small sock. More like an ankle sock. Not what I expected
2.0,I had to return this product because it was so small.
2.0,I ordered two of these necklaces to give as gifts and had to repair a broken link on one of them.
2.0,I purchased he apricot 2 pk. I am typically a size 7 in underwear. For reference I‚Äôm 154lbs & 5‚Äô3. I carry most of my weight in the belly area. I went off the size chart in the description and when they arrived they were so tight they would not even fully come up over my butt. The leg openings were very uncomfortable. I hate dealing with the hassle of returning so I gave them to my 10 year old daughter. She is a size 10/12 in childrens and they fit her perfectly.  She says they are comfortable so at least they didn‚Äôt go to waste.
2.0,"I am typically a size small, so that‚Äôs what I ordered even being 7 months pregnant and it fit perfectly, BUT the white fabric is extremely sheer! I love how this dress fits, but unfortunately I could never wear it out because it is so see through."
2.0,I love these hinged earrings but the sterling silver is too thick to go through my earlobes.  Only 14kt gold hinged hoops seem to work.  Bummer...
2.0,"I ordered the size small. These pants fit my owl just fine, except that the pants are too short.<br /><br />Fail. Because these pants have flared legs, they really need to be the correct length."
2.0,"I am 5'1"" and 126lbs, I ordered a small. It is so cute, great washed blue coloring and nice fabric. I put it on and it fit perfectly everywhere except the top. It's like it's an XL top on a small bottom. I am a 34B but I think you would need to be larger than a DD to fill this out. There was no way to even add a snap or safety pin to close it, there must've been a yard of extra billowing material. If you are extremely top heavy, this is your romper."
2.0,I like the material and style. Reviewers said to go up a size. Since I am small I ordered a medium. It was so large the cuffs came half way down my hand. The bottom came down to my knees. Very disappointed as I planned to wear post surgery. Someone at Goodwill will have a treat.
2.0,Ill fitting. Torso is way too small.
2.0,"I ordered a size small and while it fit me It was extremely small. Im super curvy and in this outfit my butt cheeks were hanging out. The material was soft and it seemed to be a comfy, but it didn't leave anything to the imagination. I will return this item."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt really like the bracelet. I returned it. The finish didn‚Äôt appeal to me.
2.0,WAY too small! Two sizes too small. Made in China. Very disappointed after reading so many rave reviews. Over-priced for the quality. And good luck getting that main zipper started.
2.0,The shirt had a hint of pink like when you wash red and white shorts together.
2.0,Does not keep perfect time runs slow my son has to fix once a week.
2.0,"These were extremely thin. Vibrant colors, but feel very cheap."
2.0,"It fits good I like the material, only one think I did not like it, it‚Äôs not the same color, in photo looks soft pink but is salmon color to bright too."
2.0,Defective stained all 3
2.0,These are a child's sunglasses. Way to small- gave them to my 9 year old niece.
2.0,One of the stones already fell out & had to glue back.<br />It's like a week old or so & wife doesn't wear it all the time.<br /><br />Too pricey also.
2.0,It doesn't look like the picture at all nor does it fit loosely.  Very disappointing!
2.0,"Gave them as party favors at a birthday party.  Many of the buttons where the snap is connected broke off within minutes of putting it on.  Also, they smelled bad, like old and musty."
2.0,"FYI - I bought the shoelaces for my daughter's volleyball team for Oct due to Breast Cancer awareness.  Is getting them ready tonight to hand out to the girls, and saw that on each pink shoelaces it has the price of $2.49. Unfortunately I paid $4.01 each!! Buyer beware!! Look elsewhere unless you want to pay almost double what they are worth- & I did that 22 times!!!"
2.0,Literally had to get my phone camera to blow up inscription. Disappointing
2.0,Material feels great just to small. I purchased the leggings in the same size and they fit great. I don't know what went wrong with the capris.
2.0,The product itself was amazing but too small so I had to return it
2.0,obviously I bought 2-I get more compliments on them
2.0,"The shirt looks very cheap, quality is not the best"
2.0,Too big for 6 months old
2.0,Did not fit nicely. Looks like a high end trash bag. Not slimming at all.
2.0,"This set is cute and has potential but arrived dusty with scuff and minor scratch marks.  It does not appear new.  I am going to return and try to get a replacement.  Hoping the replacement is new looking because I really want to keep this set.  It's hard to find hard side luggage for little ones!  Anyway, this set would be great for both my 3 year old and 6 year old to carry."
2.0,The nose rings are ok but the studs just fall out because the back is too small.
2.0,My daughter destroyed them within the first month.<br />Not good for kids who actually play outside in their uniforms at school.  This might have been okay for the occasional wear to a function or church .  Definitely not everyday.
2.0,I like the color but it was kind of warm for the temperature here in Georgia .
2.0,"I love these slippers, but  Iordered mu usual size, but they are too small.  Also, they do not appear to be washable."
2.0,It's looks cheap and gave a rash.
2.0,"Too big,too stiff and very very badly made. The color is good."
2.0,"Fits fine but is fire engine red, not the dark red pictured."
2.0,"Did not like this shirt. It had way more lace than I thought and just wasn‚Äôt flattering. Pass by,"
2.0,I am so unhappy with this purchase.
2.0,Definatly not a real soft material
2.0,The material is very sheer which you cannot tell looking at the picture.
2.0,"I usually wear an xl ...I ordered this in a 3x thinking it would run somewhat small but this is bad...cute shirt, not real good quality material though."
2.0,"Very cute outfit, but the skirt was too big and the top was way too small. If you could pick the size of the top and skirt separately I think it would have fit better."
2.0,"I ordered the 3X. However,  the top fits like a large or 1X and the bottoms fit like a 1X."
2.0,"Scratchy material, but fit was really cute. Bummer."
2.0,I returned this charm holder.  Smaller & flimsy.<br />Will not hold several charms well.
2.0,"Fair quality,not good!"
2.0,In the right size and fit it would be perfect...size runs smaller than description
2.0,It‚Äôs a cute top but the material leaves something to be desired. I didn‚Äôt pay enough attention to the description and didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs polyester fabric.
2.0,Polyester feels very plastic
2.0,"The finish started coming off within a week, cheap."
2.0,Ordered an 8 and they are huge!
2.0,"They aren't bad for the price, but the stones are not as pictured or described."
2.0,Nice bag.. but wouldn't buy again.
2.0,Nice necklace. But the bracelet was an inch short of the advertised length and impossible for the recipient to wear.
2.0,"The opals in this bracelet are green not white, and not well matched. I returned it. Length 7 3/8"", width 5/16""."
2.0,Not the quality I see in Alex & Ani-
2.0,"This top was disappointing as it is quite aTight fit and very thin fabric, it is very well priced but not a free size as expected."
2.0,"Despite the specifications clearly stating that these are polarized lenses, they are not. The packaging they came in was labeled with the correct item number (WF01PZ) and has the word polarized on it, but these sunglasses themselves don't have any indicator on them that they are polarized, and in fact they are not. They are ok other than that, but they are incorrectly marked, and I'm not going to spend all of the time to return them for $5."
2.0,"I ordered this awhile ago, and when I finally got it, it was WAY too huge, definitely not a 22g. So, I can't even use it."
2.0,"It's beautiful, but at least a size smaller than expected. Very soft!"
2.0,"Not what I expected. pretty cheaply made, materials are poor quality. Bottom line I could have gotten something similar at a discount or dollar type of store."
2.0,The fabric tore with normal use after only a week where the latch at the end of the strap attaches to the purse.  I was on a trip (which is why I purchased this particular bag) and discovered I was unable to return the product as it was outside the date for eligible returns.
2.0,It feels like swimsuit material. It's not breathable like a quick-dry kind of fabric. I wore it on a super hot sweaty day and had to change because they were so uncomfortable.
2.0,The ankle strap was a bit short for my ankles so could not buckle.  Disappointing as they were super cute.
2.0,Wanted to love this bag. Well made and fairly roomy. But those side pockets can‚Äôt fit a bottle or sippy cup once the inside of the bag is full. I am so sad and disappointed. Can‚Äôt use the bag without those pockets. Will be returning.
2.0,Wires on side are very uncomfortable.
2.0,The gown ran about 2 sizes too small
2.0,This dress fit somewhat small around my bust and was thin enough to show my bra. I am a size 14 and ordered a size XL.
2.0,Shrank easily
2.0,This was really long and looked really frumpy on. Was not flattering at all.
2.0,"It‚Äôs too see through, and really long. Not meant for shorter people. You have to be at least 5, 7‚Äù.."
2.0,"no es lo que esperaba, es demasiado chico y el material se nota de mala calidad"
2.0,Only came with one clear strap. Way to small. Got refunded but I needed it for a timely event
2.0,Is not that I expect. I don't like the sewing......white thread on black fabric
2.0,I bought myself the 3x. I just got it past my breasts. Very disappointed. It ended up fitting my mother who wears a 12-14.
2.0,Still waiting on my football chain
2.0,I really loved it but the shirt came with a stain on the back that I couldn‚Äôt take off so I ended up returning it. I wish I was given the option to exchange it out for another one
2.0,I liked the idea of this scarf design. I think they sent the wrong size it is not as large as shown on the model it fits my 8 year old grand daughter better. I‚Äôm dissppointed
2.0,"First the bad news: The lenses I received don't fit the RB3136 with 58mm lenses despite the label and product description saying so.<br /><br />Not fitting the sunglass they're intended for renders the good news about these lenses moot. Still: These lenses are lightweight, almost identical in color to the G-15 and block UV light (the UV protective coating on glass lenses like the ones used for Ray-Ban aviators can wear off over time)."
2.0,I received my clicker 2 days ago and I was so happy when I got it but the jewel has already fallen out and I'm really disappointed. Kind of feel like I wasted my money.
2.0,I bought this in a large as usual for a sweatshirt to go over other clothes. It is literally humongous on me. Looks awful! I hate the bother of returning it but .......
2.0,"Nice but tight, size runs smaller than expected"
2.0,Whatever chemicals used for manufacturing cause my skin on my face to be super irritated and a rash was developing even after washing twice in a washing machine and by hand. although my son used them and it was fine for him. So sensitive people beware.
2.0,"Unless you have the enormous face of King Long, these clip on's are far too large.  Additionally, the clip is hard to put on without using both hands and even removing my glasses to fit them on properly.  I'll return these."
2.0,"Would only look good on a very tall, very thin woman."
2.0,Absolutely will not stay on my wrist. There is a gap in the clasp when closed. It's amazing I haven't lost it.
2.0,No for the womanly XL person
2.0,Old-fashioned suit.
2.0,I‚Äôm a 32c/34b and usually if I order a small tank top they might end at my belly button or right above but this one I could barely squeeze into. The small on me first like an xs maybe even xxs
2.0,Cheap materials used.  Zipper sucks.  Gets 2 stars because my daughter likes the design
2.0,"The material and style was just what I was looking for, but the seams came undone almost immediately during the first hour of wear. That was disappointing, I wanted to love them."
2.0,"Pros:<br />Worked perfectly while they lasted<br /><br />Cons:<br />When I got these, I ordered the y style that connects to the socks and shirt. I was sent a set that has the saddle footloop style. I contacted the company and they told me to tell amazon and file a return. I didn't want to jump through hoops so I just used them.<br /><br />After a year and a half of regular use these broke. Just randomly, seemed fine one day then the stitching unwound itself the next day.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Annoyed that I received the wrong style product, and annoyed they broke so randomly. If they started to wear out I would understand, but this was 0% wear to 100% broken overnight. I wasn't even walking when they broke, I was just attaching them to my shirt.<br /><br />They worked well for a fair amount of time, but getting the wrong product and having a catastrophic end puts a sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />YOU MAY THINK MY REVIEW IS UNFAIR. PERHAPS I AM BEING TOO HARSH. THAT IS OKAY. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. Mine is so poor because I was bookended by negative things."
2.0,They spelled Soldiers (Soldies) wrong and I did not catch it in the preview pic... didnt think I needed to check spelling.
2.0,"The bottoms fit just fine, but the sizing for the bikini top is just obnoxious. It wasn't even remotely close to fitting me. I would not order this product unless you have small breasts."
2.0,"at first this hat was incredibly cute, but one of the pompoms fell off a few weeks after we got it."
2.0,Size down atleast 2 sizes to fit like normal. I order a size large and i looks like the dress was a 2x vs a large
2.0,"Color is more off white. Purchased size based on description and dress ended up being too big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù0 so the sleeves were too long as well. Decent material, but I‚Äôd recommend a size down."
2.0,"Awesome and unique item, especially when you're ready to wear it when you're in good shape! It knots up based upon the material so I wouldn't buy it or any other such material again"
2.0,"Too small, not for a 4yr old! The purple mitten is the glove we bought from this set compared to my daughter't glove from Burlington Coat factory."
2.0,"Compared to the other products by this jewelry designer, this is sub-standard. Decent for casual use/wear and that's about it."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt fit as expected so I had return this item.
2.0,Not true to size AT ALL. As recommended I ordered a size up (usually order a small and ordered a medium). Still way too small. The fabric was super comfortable though and of course loved the pockets!
2.0,They tend to be too long.
2.0,Very strange cut with no room in the but....what can you expect for the price I guess?
2.0,Material is very thin and wrinkles easily.
2.0,"The fabric is kind of slick and quick drying, so it makes for a good swimsuit coverup.  Otherwise, it's too cheap looking to wear as an outfit.  The stripe pattern is printed on the fabric."
2.0,Quallity is less than expected..
2.0,"I have other leggings from this brand so i was hoping they‚Äôd be similar to them, only lined. I was wrong. Too small if you aren‚Äôt a size 8 or smaller... and they def had a ‚Äúnylons‚Äù finish instead of a cottony finish."
2.0,beautiful but gave away
2.0,"Obviously not the real thing, sizing is small. I ordered an XL and it fit like a M"
2.0,Did not like material! Icthcy
2.0,"I hated giving this sweater a 2 star because it's REALLY cute, however, I feel like mine was tagged wrong. I noticed in another review, that the woman ordered a large and still had room.... my size and built is very similar to hers and I ordered the extra large because I really wanted that baggy look.... NOPE! I tried it on and it fit like a small/medium cotton sweater with NO give whatsoever! I wish this company got it right because I WANT TO LOVE THIS SWEATERüò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´<br />It also arrived before scheduled, so I was really pleased with that!"
2.0,Hard to put on with one hand
2.0,"I took this out of the package to try on and had fuzzy stuff on my face, in my hair, on my shirt, the floor, the carpet. I am returning because I think it won't survive even a gentle wash without becoming bald from loosing the fluffy fibers. I got it to wear as part of a Halloween cosume but also thought it would be cute and warm for winter. It is a cute design but not I think good quality and or worth the price."
2.0,Too small. I even read the reviews and ordered an XL. I'm only 135lbs. These are made for children. They are really cute! Wish I could wear them.
2.0,The crystal or gem was attached very poorly.  It is secure but very crooked and looks horrible.
2.0,"It fits, but not quite as fitted as I had imagined--but that may be a positive for some.<br /><br />As you can see, it 8s missing the metal clasps, the shoulder pads aren't as prominent as they should be, the pouches are flat & their openings are smaller than the pouch itself, and the collar is not puffed but flat like a varsity jacket. Even the emblem on the back is wacky and seems sewn in a rush<br /><br />Overall, it's a light material, so it can be worn over anything and not feel restricted, but it is a far cry from what isadvertised in the photographs on this page."
2.0,These are tiny for<br />Kids hands.
2.0,"I don‚Äôt know what size 40 refers to.  Pants are too big for me while the waist (I‚Äôm 35) is too tight. Bell botom shape to be adjusted with scratch. Lining is a solid polyester material which does not look very confortable, not a soft breathable lining. Outside is a nice waterproof material."
2.0,The pattern was great but the material was not. When I breathed it sucked the material in.
2.0,"My son is on the small side, a bit tall but very thin and he is only 9 years old. Size large shirts are huge on him and he wears medium (which are even a bit big). I got child's size medium but it is was comically small, at least 2 or three sizes too small, sleeves and pants were almost to his elbows and knees. I was worried he might rip it just trying it on, but thankfully it is a bit stretchy. I'd say the medium might work for a 5/6 year old tops. Also the material is thin and not warm enough for trick-or-treat so you'd have to layer with thermals underneath except the costume is very tight (was skin tight on him) so it would be difficult to layer with, but maybe if your child was much younger they could fit it over a layer. I would try it in a large or XL but they only offer small and medium so we'll have to get it somewhere else."
2.0,Very thin material...cheap feeling. Also fits small and short. I ended up returning it
2.0,Huge oversized pearls on a string. Wife didn‚Äôt really like these.
2.0,Bought this for my daughter and was very surprised with how beautiful it looked.  She was thrilled.  However after only a few months of daily use  the logo and color came off and we were not happy with it.  It was made well and strong but we bought it because she has a green jeep and wanted the Keychain to match.  Great for show just not daily use
2.0,These leggings are very sheer. Beautiful but sheer. There is no elastic at the bottom of the legs and the knit is bagging at the ankles after one wearing.
2.0,Cute but somehow broke in the breast pocket of my jacket???
2.0,Band isn‚Äôt bad but the spring pins are IMPOSSIBLE to remove. So I can‚Äôt even wear it..
2.0,"I first loved this dress, totally comfortable and fits well BUT then I noticed it was shedding. I wore it with black tights and my tights had flakes of shimmer all over them by lunch time. It get's EVERYWHERE. In your hair, up your nose, on your chair...everywhere. At first you don't notice but the more you move around and touch anything black it appears. I took it off and my bra was covered in that stuff. Not the best quality and horrible for the environment."
2.0,Runs Big
2.0,"The underwear fit fine (over my try on underwear), but the padding in the front is not conducive to race cycling, there is plenty in back, but when leaned over handlebars during racing or training, it doesn't extend to the pubic symphysis and cushion there. They are really pretty though!"
2.0,Low quality. Ripped while putting on from the holes in it
2.0,"My son liked the colors of this band but it was hard for him to get on and off by itself. It also broke less than a month after getting it, I wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
2.0,"The two bras felt like they were different sizes.  The black was a little small and the nude was way big, although ordered the same size.  Also, even though they sell a larger size, it provides no support for larger breasts.  Overall disappointed."
2.0,"The waistband wrinkled permanently and were very uncomfortable after a dozen wears.  In the beginning, I loved the softness and wide smooth waistband, but now they go in the trash.  What a waste of money."
2.0,I found the material to be very unpleasant against the skin and grabs the skin as it slide across.  Its 100% polyester and perhaps is necessary to allow sweat to evaporate but I couldnt wear it.<br />Its very thin and clingy material which again I find unpleasant to wear.<br />The workmanship and seams look well done.<br />Very gentle cold wash and low heat ironing is required.
2.0,Charm fell off super easily and was very cheap feeling. I would not recommend this product
2.0,Look good but after only using them a few times They fell apart. Had to tie them in a knot.
2.0,"very thin breathable material, would be fine for spring and summer nights but i bought this in the winter... easily gets a lot of lint on it too"
2.0,"It was a cute dress, I usually wear a Medium and bought a medium...it was a little snug, but could have worn it ok.... the problem I had, and why I returned it, is the short side of the dress was SO short!  I mean, if I would have tried it on with boy shorts, I'm pretty sure they would have been visible (and Im not that tall).. I was looking to wear this to a wedding and did not think it fit appropriately for that."
2.0,When I open and put it on it was ripped.
2.0,Returned - Quality was not as expected.
2.0,"This vest is super small. My daughter is very petite and wears two to three sizes smaller than the average sized girl her age. I did read reviews that said to order a size up because it runs small, which I did. I ordered the next size/age up as they list their sizing by age. When I received it, I couldn‚Äôt even confirm the size because the tag had been cut off. So I‚Äôm not even sure I received the size I ordered as there was no way to confirm or distinguish its size. As for fabric quality, I would agree with other reviews that it is on the thin side. In addition, the print and color combo is cute, it‚Äôs just unfortunate that the sizing and quality are off."
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt stay clasped
2.0,The material is cheap and the tutu color did not match product picture. It was more of a dull blue that did not match. Ended up throwing away.
2.0,"Do not purchase this item. It will be to small. I ordered a large and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 140 lbs, 36C, size 7/8 in dress size, and it would not zip up all the way. It also was not long enough AND not the correct color. I ordered gray, not blue. Sending back and not happy. They are also making me pay shipping!!! Very unprofessional."
2.0,"Runs really small, going up in size helps"
2.0,This hat was supposed to be a white cross on blue background but the background was actually a purplish color.  It was an inexpensive hat but even taking that into account it was not good quality.
2.0,Wrong color and wrong necklace . Far from the mint color. It was a darker green color
2.0,Nice shirt but the medium was too small
2.0,"These arw very nice shorts. They seem to be made true to the original uniform. However, they are sized wrong. I am a 35 to 36 inch wIst dependwing on the pants. I ordered the large (35-38). They are too tight in the waist to be comfortable when sitting. They are also a little longer than I would like. They hit me below the knee. I don‚Äôt want to order the next size up because I don‚Äôt want the legs of the shorts to be baggier and longer. These may work for some, but not for me."
2.0,I ordered a medium even though every top I order anywhere is a XS-S. It was way way too small. This would have fit if my chest was a few sizes smaller. I‚Äôd say it probably wouldn‚Äôt fit over a C cup.
2.0,They are ok. Not as excited as I‚Äôd hope to be
2.0,"Very cute shirt, it's not screen print is actual iron on decal so I'm not sure how long it will last. Also when it arrived the fit was perfect however I washed it and it shrank a lot. If you can't order two size up I would suggest not ordering it."
2.0,"Although the necklace itself is as pictured, the quality is fine etc.. the inside heart is the exact size of the cutout so everytime you move the inner heart easily slides thru the outer one and the necklace falls off. It was a cute concept but the inner heart should have been a bit larger and/or weighted  because not only won't it stay hanging like it shows in the photo, it won't even stay on."
2.0,Hem is uneven and doesn't seem well made (even though material seems nice.
2.0,The clasp for closure is very weird. Not expected and makes it too tight around the neck
2.0,"I ordered the sand, navy and white shorts and was happy when I opened the package. The shorts looked good and fit well. But as soon as I washed them, my delight turned to disappointment. The creases had disappeared and the material is hard to iron. Even after careful ironing, the material does not look good.  I really wanted to be able to keep them but returned the sand ones, and have yet to decide about returning the navy. The white ones don't look as creased (maybe because of the light color) so I may keep those."
2.0,So thin. Won‚Äôt get any protection.
2.0,Runs very small. Order up a size. Material was also thin and not very thick.
2.0,"I received this wallet as a gift from my sister and was initially excited about it.  The print was fun and I like the fact that it snapped close. It was also convenient because I only carry the essentials like my ID, debit card and cash. Everything was working great until about a week after I had it and the seams underneath near the fold came loose. Now, two weeks later the seams are completely undone. Needless to say I was overall very disappointed about this product and its poor quality. I gave this product two stars only because of the print. Buy at own risk."
2.0,"Thick material but wish i would have listened to other reviews. There is hardly a stretch to these, so definitely recommend 2 sizes larger."
2.0,"Completely open on both sides, so it's not too great to leave around and walk around a beach. It also got red dye over so many items of clothing and ruined them when I washed it."
2.0,The material is really cheap.. it looks like a cheap plastic leather I've ordered it in a medium. The waistline is too large..Im 170lbs 5'8
2.0,ok for the cost...the lenses are not very clear...almost seems like they are dull plastic
2.0,"sorry, it just looked too low rent.  It stretched nicely though."
2.0,Size runs really small!
2.0,Did not wash well. It got distorted.
2.0,"Super tiny and thin, not 16G. Needed something quick so my piercing didn‚Äôt close up. This was too tiny, more like 18g."
2.0,"Just received yesterday. Despite the waistband being elastic, it‚Äôs still very tight for a one-size fits all. Beautiful print on skirt, but it is not lined & slightly see through."
2.0,Skirt is way too small. Sizing is not accurate
2.0,"these pinch my small head and leave a big red mark on the bridge of my nose, if I wear them too long I get  a terrible headache, plus they rub up on my eyebrows in such a weird way that when I do take them off my eyebrows have a strange part where the glasses parted the little hairs...I really don't like wearing these, but I am told they look ok on my face. If you have a big head or even a really small head like me, or a normal nose (not a thin narrow one) or eyebrows that are for real then these are not for you. Yes they are cheap, but I a have purchased cheaper glasses that are more comfortable, so I feel these are pricey if you can't wear them."
2.0,Color does come off as it gets worn and wet.
2.0,"One of these earrings is beautiful! The other one looks like it went to great clips.  It has a thinner tassel, which is also about 3 cm shorter, and cut completely crooked.  In order to even it out, I would've had to cut it 2 cm shorter.  I am sending these back for a replacement.  I will update my review if the second pair is in better shape.  I really hope the second pair is better, because the &#34;good&#34; earring was super cute!!"
2.0,Wore this everyday but eventually the stones started falling out
2.0,I wish I could say I liked it but unfortunately the belt broke the 1st time it was put on. I may try another product your customer service is very good
2.0,"Not really great quality, and it started tarnishing after 5 months"
2.0,"These mitts do NOT remove tarnish.  Sure - they might work if you rub them over your silver every day.  But so would a towel.  If there's even a little discoloration, it doesn't get it ""loosened"" in order to buff off with a clean cloth.  These were just an expensive pair of dust rags.  I went back to my reliable Cape Cod Silver Cleaner - also available on Amazon."
2.0,These earrings are uncomfortable and the stones fall out. Wish I never would have purchased.
2.0,"These look like a quality product, but I'm giving them 2 Stars b/c because it did not fit my foot. But that's really an Amazon problem. The whole &#34;Product Fit&#34; kind of implies Length when it comes to Shoes, not Width. I will be returning this Product for that reason, but I don't really think its fair to give it 2-stars. I feel that I have a normal size foot, and that these were too Narrow, but I don't have a measurement to substantiate my claim of having an Avg Foot."
2.0,"I got size 22plus, and this dress is really tight around the chest (50DD). The length is nice, comes to just above the knee(5'10""), and the fabric is very light weight and would be great for spring/fall. Its just unwearable b/c of the chest."
2.0,"was too small.. tried to order according to size chart.  had to give it away because shipping it back was frowned on by the seller, so i gave it away to someone else.  it is a nice shirt, but beware of sizing."
2.0,Black one had a hole in it. Too lazy to return.
2.0,"My biggest problem with this dress, or at least the dress I got, is that it‚Äôs not long. It hits at the most unflattering length ‚Ä¶ too bad I was really excited to find a maxi sweater dress. The search continues"
2.0,The top and bottom proportion were off :/
2.0,Not much cushion.
2.0,"Customer service is great.  purchased and received and started to wear, however 1 earring would not stay clasped.  Asked for replacement and received promptly without any hassle.  Went to put in the replacement only to find that the other earring came unclasped as well and was lost who knows where.  These are cute, small snuggie hoops, but they do not stay clasped and if you don't catch it, you can loose it."
2.0,"Too short and tight, sent it back!"
2.0,"One of the straps broke off completely within a week and a half. It was a wonderful and convenient bag while it lasted, but I would not purchase again. Disappointed."
2.0,The dress was super cute and she loves it but the crown and wand were broken when they came in. It showed up 2 days before her birthday so there was no time to get a replacement.  I had to super glue them and hope they stayed together until she opened it. Also the butterflies are paper cutouts with a safety pin so be prepared to pin all of them on yourself and you have to take them all off of you wash it.
2.0,Way too big.  You would need a large head and big ears to make these seem proportional.  Diameter is approx a dime.
2.0,Chain was broken when it arrived. Easy to fix but annoying. Wasn't worth the hassle to return.
2.0,"Size 31 waist, so I ordered a small.  They were too big.  Not enough compression.  There is also a seam that goes right down the middle of the back.  I wanted some with a longer length.  They were long,  but these didn't work in other ways."
2.0,The shorts fit great but don‚Äôt be fooled by the top. It‚Äôs pretty much a dress.
2.0,"I bought these for myself to wear for every day.<br />Of the 3 pr none if them fit the same. I ordered Medium<br />1 pr I can't even pull past my knees,1 pr is so big they hang loose(biker shorts DO NOT HANG) 1 pr Is wearable but they pull up so high past my waist they are uncomfortable"
2.0,Pros:<br />- many different choices<br />- all choices are pretty cute and simple<br /><br />Cons:<br />- made of cheap gold plated plastic and metal<br />- jewelry tarnished while I was wearing it
2.0,"As other people mentioned, these sizes run small, but I decided to take a chance anyway. I am a small usually, and fit into a small for the PJs, but friends who were larger were not as lucky. The tops are easier fitting, the shorts are very tight and cut weird, got stuck in between your legs. Wanted to use these as bridesmaids gifts, had to return."
2.0,My butt literally did not fit in these haha
2.0,Not good for girls with long legs
2.0,Fit was terrible.
2.0,I wear a 36D I ordered a Large and it wouldn't even zip it was so small.
2.0,did not like the color or fit
2.0,"It  TRUN IN 2 WEEKS  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, you have a bless day"
2.0,I buy a lot of watches and I love these watches but I will not wear a watch with Sparkle Star on it. Sounds like a Disney watch
2.0,"Since I saw the reviews about the size I order a XL dress, but what I did not expected was the surprise about the length. I'm 5'1&#34; and the dress sit just right above my hip. In order to wear it I must use a legging or a pant. The description should read &#34;very long shirt&#34; instead of mini dress. ."
2.0,Top is too short and so is bottom. I wear a medium but I ordered a large and it is still too little.
2.0,Fell.apart
2.0,Pink is alot brighter than expected
2.0,"Points for being cute, but they are poorly made.  There is no give in the fabric, and they do not fit over my skinny daughter's ankle, much less go up to her calf.  They'd probably fit my 7 year old, though they'd go too high up her leg.  Very disappointing."
2.0,Tags and seaming were all inside out from eachother.
2.0,"The shirt itself is soft and comfy. However after 2 washes, the lettering started peeling off."
2.0,Great keychain. But the chain attached broke almost immediately.
2.0,"i have bought these for years but they put their logo on the rear ankle and now i wont wear them. I wear this for everyday socks, not trying to show off the logo every time my socks show."
2.0,"Poor quality, many of the charms displayed in the picture were not included, it was maybe 6 different charms duplicated."
2.0,Cute but it is cheaply made and mine broke the first week.
2.0,Broke quickly.  Screws that hold it in came out and were lost right away
2.0,"The size was way off.  XL was more like a medium. It‚Äôs cute though.  I didn‚Äôt bother with a return, just donated it."
2.0,The shoulder straps are way too short. The cup area is about 4 inches above my breast area. I went up a size but that doesn‚Äôt address the too short straps.
2.0,the clicker nevr really stayed clasped. kept falling out.
2.0,Returned as these are hand-wash only
2.0,I was disappointed with this dress. The material felt like a plastic tablecloth and smelled like one too. The shape/style of cut not what I expected.
2.0,No bling from the &#34;rhinestones&#34;.  Returned item.
2.0,debris all over the floors as grippers/tread fell off.
2.0,Fits on the smaller side & the material feels cheap
2.0,After wearing two times it got loose. Do not buy this product!
2.0,"I returned these as the chamois was lacking.  If they could figure out how to make a better chamois, the bibs themselves were fine.  I returned them."
2.0,"I gave two stars because it advertises use on fishing rod grips. DO NOT apply to rod grips. May work fine on shoes or other things that you do not need to grab, but no good for rod grips. Leaves them tacky and they clearly look like there is a shiny coating on them. If you too made the mistake and applied this stuff to a rod grip then you are in luck. Here is what you do... Use a hot wet towel to remove this stuff from the grip. You will need to hold it on the grip then rub the glue off. (This stuff seems like nothing more than school glue, just slightly thinner). Once you have removed it look on Amazon for U-40 Cork Seal. A couple of dollars more but this is the stuff! It soaks in and applies easy. End result is a nice softer cork feel. Only upside to me using the Cadilac sealer was the process to remove it must have removed dirt and made the cork exceptionally clean.(I am sure there is an easier way to do that though)"
2.0,Sizing was definitely off ordered a large & X large & still too small
2.0,"The photos show the bow with clasps that connect to the belt but neither the belt, bow, or dress itself have any clasps or Velcro anything at all to be able to connect the bow idk how I‚Äôm going to include it with having to buy safety pins or clasps to sew onto it myself now"
2.0,"I purchased this because it says that it fits a 5.3"" wrist, but it was falling off of me and my wrist is 5.5"". Sending it back and trying a different one."
2.0,very small like for an infant
2.0,Small is big.
2.0,"I was disappointed it wasn‚Äôt the shape of that shown in the picture.  It was very rectangular and wide, the fabric almost went from ear to ear.  The picture showed a more fitted and different design."
2.0,"Dress is ok, material of dress is soft, color is okay, the fit is small."
2.0,"i didn't use this purse till just now! After two trips to the store the studs are falling off, very disappointed. Otherwise it's good size soft and lots of cargo space! Plus I am embarrassed to use it as purse now!"
2.0,The tank tops feel amazing and fit just as they said they would except the lace is already coming apart. It started as soon as I put it on at the bottom of the tank top!
2.0,These pants can easily look cheap.  The belts are super short. Does not look the least formal as the pic.
2.0,"The ear holes are merely slits that won't fit my average sized ears. It did keep my mouth shut while it was in my head, but the material is too thick and very uncomfortable."
2.0,very loosely fitted and sloppy looking.  Returned it.
2.0,"They came in a package but didn't fit the same at all. They came quickly I just wish they fit. Ones too small and ones too big. But the gray pair is at least comfy, that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of one."
2.0,"These earrings were bought to match a ring I was giving my daughter as a gift. They are breathtakingly beautiful, but the post broke from the back of the earring right at the base of the stud on the very first day she wore them. That was disappointing...because they are beautiful. I wish they had lasted longer."
2.0,Doesn't look like the picture didn't come with lace to  pull the sleeve back
2.0,This is HUGE like a car tire. Ugly.
2.0,Bust measurements do not match size chart. Only a completely flat-chested woman can wear this.
2.0,The idea is cute but they are really small and cheap looking
2.0,"If you have high arches, these should be fine.  I don't.  For me the arch just dug into my foot.  It was a small spot. Almost as if you cut a golf ball in half and put it in there.  Very pinpointed issue - not really a gradual arch at all.  Never had this issue with flip flops and that includes a few pair of Reef's.  The sandals looked fine and I really wanted to like them, but I really couldn't wear these for more than a few minutes without discomfort.  If you have higher arches, you may not feel this at all and they may be great.  Other than that, size was fine."
2.0,Very light and not huge. Functions ok but it included no users manual. The internet manuals do not cover the &#34;master fishing&#34; watch nor discuss any of the fishing functions. By trial and error I found the change from centigrade to fahrenheit. Push 10 times at B etc. Except it reverts right back to celsius. As far as tracking functions only the barometer is straight forward. How do you find a manual and why is a paper one no in the box? Where is the internet info on the &#34;master fishing&#34; watch? Also my own fault there is no compass which it sorely needs.
2.0,I love these hangers and I think they work great in my closet. J was disappointed when in paid about 12 dollars for them and when I got the hangers they had the price of 3.99 on them from bed bath and beyond. I even went to look and yup 3.99 for the set. I paid triple the price here.  I would return but dont want to go through the hassle of returning.
2.0,Es un regalo de navidad y llego sin nada de bater√≠a. No puedo ponerle bater√≠a porque el empaque pl√°stico si lo abro mi Hija no lo va a poder abrir y seria un regalo abierto. Lo siento pero es inaceptable.
2.0,Smaller than expected. Didn't like the quality.
2.0,"Material is nice and thick but it was an extremely awkward fit on my body. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and top-heavy and it really just did not look roght, I had to return it"
2.0,These are super tight around the top seam and dug in to my calves.  The print stretches out and you can barely tell that it's flames.
2.0,It looks nice on the model but the material doesn‚Äôt flatter your shape. It‚Äôs not soft and it‚Äôs a thick spandex feel. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
2.0,Gold heart doesn't match the rose gold.
2.0,Beautiful design and color. But I never wore it because the material and construction were so cheap.
2.0,"The socks fit great - tight and stayed on my child‚Äôs feet but they got a pull in them the first time they were worn. As expensive as they are, I would have expected them to not pull or not pull until they were much older.  Would not spend the money on these again."
2.0,"this case feels cheap, looks cheap, and doesn't even fit the 40mm, series 6 apple watch like it claims. returning."
2.0,"Tight fit, M in NorthFace has always fit before. Stitching on the finger ripped after a month of light use. Definitely not a good option for warmth under 30F."
2.0,"The material is great. It's stretchy and comfortable. But, the straps are loose. I wore it and while putting it on my wrist the strap snapped off and the watch fell. My Movado watch face only got a scratch but it could have broke."
2.0,One of the pairs has a chipped lens.
2.0,"I'm a size 12, 38&#34; bust, and I ordered a Large to give me some extra room. Surprise! Not only was there no extra room, the top didn't even come close to zippering in the chest area, and it's supposed to be a 40. I'm returning and replacing with something else because in addition to the sizing issues, this is a thin, fairly cheaply made costume and it's for a fancy gala. If you happen to be going to a fundraiser or somewhere where the costumes need to be more elaborate, this won't do the trick. This would be great, however, for your standard Halloween party. They need to fix their sizing chart, though. Very frustrating."
2.0,"This is an adorable watch, but I can only read it in certain light.  The silver letters on the face don't stand out enough on the black face, and the silver minute and hour hands aren't distinct enough from the second hand.  Maybe it is my eyes because in direct indoor light, I can see them properly.  Rather than recommend it to a friend, I would just give it to them after giving them a chance to read it."
2.0,"I have had this watch sin April of this year, its a nice watch the time piece is a little big. When adjusting the date, time and month the dial comes loose. Last week it finally came off and I am not able to adjust the time etc. Needles to say I am disappointed."
2.0,The gem is pretty.  I am not a big fan of this jewelry because of the length the bar.  It was way to long for my nose.
2.0,I love the style ordered. Large bit snug in shoulder sent back for xl fits smaller than large. 5'3 160 I have to remind myself can't order from companies that don't have tAgs for care or what material is! So disappointed 2nd time around.
2.0,Poor quality shirt. The sewing was not done professionally...looks like someone makes them in their basement. I kept it only because I needed a long sleeve shirt that is long to wear under other shirts in the winter. Does not look like the shirt in the picture much and certainly does not fit like the picture shows. The fabric is not as stretchy.
2.0,2 big my fault
2.0,Bands are decent for the money BUT 2 out of 5 are unusable because the lins don't fit through the holes in the plastic end caps. Of course the two that I can't use are the two that I was most looking forward to.
2.0,Loved the size & shape of earrings finish wore off very quickly
2.0,"It broke at the second use, not heat resistant.  Kind of see through, very thin rubber."
2.0,My boobs keep slipping out at the bottom - the product seems to be designed without knowledge of a woman‚Äôs boobs!
2.0,It broke the first day and I had to use an old one i had
2.0,These do not look like the picture they are very doll not shiny at all I got for my 2 year old and they way her ear way down. I'm gonna hold on to them though maeby couple more years and they will fit I guess
2.0,I got this ones bcs I love polka dots and I was buying warm items for an Europe trip. I got it Large as others I bought and way too tied. No expanding at all. I used them once and thats it.
2.0,These work. Vibrant colours but not well made.
2.0,The shirt fits but the pants not so much. They put a thick piece of elastic for the waste. The string on the pant are fake and  shred the first wash.
2.0,Poor quality. Color rubbed off.
2.0,I don‚Äôt it is 4+. Seems the lenses is not clear
2.0,"Glasses are lightweight and frames seem to be of good quality but they have smudged badly on day one.  Glass cleaning cloth doesn't slide easily over the lens to clean them well.  There is a terrible, distracting glare.  I haven't had my fingers all over them, they must sit too close to my almost non-existent eyelashes.  Pretty useless. They get two stars for the frame quality."
2.0,"Sadly these looked and felt cheap. Even from a distance, I could tell that the metal looked textured and not well made. They were a bit heavy, as well."
2.0,"Bead was yellow, not gold like pictured"
2.0,"There is a chemical smell.  The instructions said to handwash in water and when I did, a lot of dye ran out.  Very pretty design but I am still trying to get all the dye out before I wear it."
2.0,It was small and looks nothing like the picture
2.0,"I ordered the SKUNK and was sent the wolf! I already purchased the wolf from another company, so durring the holiday rush I was stuck with 2 wolfs and no skunk as gifts for my daughter. Instead of going through the hassel of returning it (I live far out in the country so returns are a huge hassle) & then waiting till after the holidays for the correct one, I'm saving it to give to someone else. I've been told that the skunk is really cute, too bad I was sent the wrong item :("
2.0,"Kind of cheap looking, but definitely not the worst I've seen. I'm 5.3 120 lbs and tend to find that &#34;smalls&#34; can end up either just righ, a little large or way too big for me (depending on company) - and this small was way too small, the last thing you want in a romper is for it to ride up and not lay right. . . . so I sent it back. For a smaller girl under 5.3, this could be cute! Or maybe on someone taller/thinner build, with long legs!"
2.0,The quality is very poor. It's like they cut it with some scissors. Mine still had bits of square fabric attached to the cut out pieces. Gave it to stars because it did arrive early.
2.0,The item didn't fit well.  Leaves terrible panty line.
2.0,"I basically had to take a pair of pliers to tighten the butterflies so they‚Äôd stop falling off. Also, the color is kinda faded and the butterflies are hard to clean without taking the earring out. Earring also kinda flops around a lot."
2.0,Leather was not up to par as claimed.
2.0,the color on the ad picture is a deep blue but he hat is almost a royal blue not Air Force blue
2.0,I'm not a huge fan of the material or the cut but the colors are nice
2.0,The band is OK. It has a sticky type feeling to it and builds up a white material on it that I can scrap away with my nail.  The loop is also hard to move around and sticks to the band.  Probably would go for something else if you have an option.
2.0,"This was my first time buying motorcycle pants. I have seen motorcycle pants in the store, and felt them, so I thought I was safe buying these. I can usually go into a store and buy a pair of 36x30 jeans and know that they will fit. I bought that size with these, but they fit like skinny jeans. The crotch was too small and it was really uncomfortable sitting on a bike. I didn't ride my bike as it was too uncomfortable just sitting on it for a few seconds.<br />I expected the material of the pants to be as thick as typical jeans. These were much thinner. In comparison, my Dickie's jeans are thicker, maybe 2x thicker.<br />Between the size problem and the thin material, I decided to return them. They just weren't for me, or what I wanted."
2.0,Cute but too big and boxy... sold off resale site to get money back.
2.0,I guess they expect a foot to be big and fat. They added extra stretchy band that made it too big around my ankles.<br />The design is beautiful.
2.0,"Although comfortable, it‚Äôs a little too ‚Äúcamp counselor‚Äù for me, not flattering at all. I‚Äôm not a fan. I‚Äô"
2.0,Very small top but bottom is ok. Not American size and it‚Äôs not consistent. The bottom fits good but the top squeezed me up. Not for ample size chest.
2.0,can't wear long time. ears hurt when wearing more that 2 hours
2.0,"I do like this coat, it is warm and soft...but I am disappointed my coat wasn't lined when I received it. My friend recently ordered the same coat and it was lined. I see all the images for this coat have lining and I am annoyed about mine."
2.0,My biggest problem with the dress is how difficult it is to wear and have your back covered. I bought an adhesive bra for this but the sides are so open even that showed.  I was not a fan of the bulk added to my waist due to wrapping the fabric.  The fabric itself was unpleasant and thin. I would not recommend.
2.0,The button locations are VERY difficult to operate correctly. Not sure if they are slightly off place what the problem is.<br />I have to press them very hard to make them work. It`s NOT comfortable to work with.
2.0,"Great dress for the price but way too long for someone petite. I am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and even with high heels/wedges, this dress was way too long. Had to send it back."
2.0,I bought this thinking it would be a great sleep bra and nursing bra when the baby gets here. I washed it today let it hang to dry and I am a little larger in the chest area I want expecting miracles I was however expecting it to hold its shape and not let my boobs pop out of place after wearing it for an hour! Seriously I mean is soft but I've had crappy sport bras hold me in place longer than this thing. If I didn't wash it I would return it save your money. This thing is trash
2.0,These gloves are not as they were advertised!  They are not sheepskin lined. Nor are they Cashmere lined. The gloves are lined with a knitted wool or similar synthetic and not real comfortable at 10 degree weather.  Seems like quite a few Amazon products are not what Amazon advertises.  Obviously this is a real management problem for Amazon and goes direct to credibility.  Does Amazon intend to replace these gloves?  How do I determine that?
2.0,"You get what you pay for. Very cheaply made, the inside doesnt hold cards they all slide all the way thru, I thought someone stole my CC but it slipped down behind license."
2.0,"I think the model above is either Photoshopped, or wearing another bra under this one. Or made of silicone.<br />I reeeally like this bra - it's amazingly soft, with nice, simple, un-scratchy cotton lace - and I haven't worn a bra with only two hooks since I was a teenager, so that was exciting! But like the other reviews suggest, it's really large, and doesn't even offer enough support for a sleep bra in my opinion. I'm considering going down a couple sizes in both band and cup just to give it another shot. Will update if I do."
2.0,"I liked the looks, length and easy of installing<br />The 1 major flaw is it always loosened up. Needs a stronger or bigger magnet to hold it securely in place. I've used other products like this for other Fitbits and loved them. I would not recommend this particular brand for a Pixel watch."
2.0,These did not fit and i don't have large arms.  I gave them away to children to wear for dressup.  BOO...
2.0,This ring set was bent in and broke from the card that was holding it together... This set appears to be very cheap looking also... I guess I got what I purchased .... I won't be shopping from this site again...
2.0,It looks dirty. I get the material is supposed to be like a dostrsssed nice vintage hat look! But when I opened the box it seemed like there were sweat stains on it already
2.0,These are green & gold; I thought they were black & gold.  Very thin material.  Not very good quality but price was real low too.  Not worth returning but I wouldn‚Äôt buy again.
2.0,Beautiful necklace but stone fell out after 1 week
2.0,"I was thinking that it would be similar to other necklace that I bought to this distribuitor, but this particular necklace looks so cheaper... I dont like at all"
2.0,After two uses two of the cleats won't hold. I would not buy these again.
2.0,Although the band is soild (and heavy) the black paint comes off revealing the silver steel underneath.
2.0,The plates are spaced to far apart and it wont stay buttoned  You get what you pay for i guess
2.0,"Too small!  I tried to communicate & request exchange for single Amer. flag, but received no reply.  I will not return unless I have confirmation that I will then receive product I want thereafter."
2.0,There is no way this top is one-size fits all. I wear a 34b bra and it was tight around my chest once the button was done up and you cannot wear it without that button. The pattern and colors were adorable but I have to return it because I cannot wear it comfortably.
2.0,I bought these for my brother. Before washing them I noticed how ruff the material was-not what I was expecting from Polo Ralph Lauren.<br />I washed them today and I think I'll use them to help sand down the walls. Don't waste your money like I did.
2.0,"this earring wasn't a great shape for my ear and I had to bend it slightly, which was fine it didn't seem to effect the look of the jewelry at all. but I didn't like the post and ball set up either. the earring was always rotating in the piercing. and finally today the ball fell off while I was in the shower making the earring useless. I will be looking for another piece with a different securing feature."
2.0,they seemed longer in the picture.
2.0,I know it says (on the Amazon KID'S SHOE FIT GUIDE) that &#34;shoe sizes may vary by brand&#34; the Little Kid size 1 that was sent actually measured a Big Kid size 5 on that same chart!!!! That's a bit over the top.............the shoe itself is very cute but I'm a little skeptical about my reorder.
2.0,I read all the reviews about them being too small and ordered them three sizes too big and they were still too tight.  Were these even designed for men who have a penis?  There is no room for a penis of even the smallest size.  If you have a penis I don't think these are for you.  Even three sizes bigger than your normal size and they are too small.<br />Oh and I am a size 32 waist so getting a 2 XL shouldn't be too tight.
2.0,"The fabric was really poor quality, it felt plastic-like, and the fit was really loose and shapeless even in the small size. Not like the picture at all. It looked like a hospital gown."
2.0,I wish I'd sent it back. I just don't think it looks right on me. The legs are very long and you can't hang it in the closet without stretching it
2.0,"Within 2 weeks of average use, the pins that connect the band to the watch bent. Bought a better quality band and the watch itself is ok."
2.0,they don't keeping  tap of the day i bought it
2.0,"This outfit does not run true to size.  It's very nice & sexy so I am going to now order a 2XL even though I am 170 lbs. , 5'5 this should fit perfect."
2.0,"Runs large, a lot of excess fabric. I understand it is to give a ruched look, but it just adds a lot of bulk to the body of the dress, making it unflattering"
2.0,Ordered an XL but it fit like a medium.  I‚Äôm a size 14.  Not for the curvy woman.
2.0,Disappointing that had nice color but were a tight fit
2.0,"I bought these in light brown for my 12 month old daughter about a month ago. She‚Äôs worn them about two out of three days since then, and they already have holes in them. She crawls and is learning to walk, so the toes get plenty of wear, but I still think that if these are designed for babies in this stage of life, they should be more durable. The fringe curled up almost immediately. The color of the shoe started scraping off on the toes and bottoms almost immediately.<br /><br />The best part is the elastic around the top, which is key to keeping the shoe on. I baby wear her (in the last month I wore her on some flights, on a mountain hiking vacation, and around our local area in New York City), and the shoes both stayed on the whole time, so they have that going for them. I‚Äôd recommend these for pre-crawling babies, but not for babies on the move like my little one. With holes in the shoes after one month, it feels like a rip off."
2.0,"I gave this to my daughter, bought a large and fits like a small/ xsmall"
2.0,Cute BRACELET. But I didn't want a bracelet. I have small feet/ ankles and I couldnt get it on. Disappointed.
2.0,handle and wheel broke first trip.
2.0,The pattern in fire but should not be marketed as a sweatshirt. Its crazy thin nylon material. Almost like loose fitting dri-fit. Can not be worn alone. Needs something (long johns or something) underneath for sure.
2.0,Didn‚Äôt work right.
2.0,Backs do not stay on at all. They slip off so easy.
2.0,Product ran small and couldn't use it. Otherwise appreciated the quality.
2.0,It was huge on me. Much to big to wear.
2.0,"Disappointingly thin. Absolutely useless as a bib. Babys aren't cheap, I can't afford for a bib just to be ""decorative""."
2.0,I'm overall disappointed with this top. It fit great everywhere but in the neckline. I can't imagine anyone not falling out of this top. I altered the neckline a lot by sewing some panels near the back to bring the neckline up but it was still too much. The neckline is ridiculous.
2.0,Just wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. Nice for what it is.
2.0,I love the bracelet but a few crystal stones were missing from the gold beads.
2.0,"Snap broke off romper after first washing, cheaply made."
2.0,It is beutiful shirt but they send the wrong size.
2.0,After about 4 days of wearing it. Turned my husband's finger green. Stainless steel is in the description. This is false. It is not stainless steel.
2.0,The waist band is detached so you have to tie it on their.
2.0,"Color of the dress is more tan than in the picture, therefore it looks cheap on person. Dissapointed, had to return."
2.0,"The product is great, shipping time was not"
2.0,"They were horrible the 1st time I wore them I lost one of them they did not snap and close together so don't bother buying them. they don't close I sent them back twice and they send me the same thing back,and I didn't  Realise."
2.0,"Okay I bought this shirt a year or so ago and loved it. This one I just bought now is much lower quality, thinner fabric and not sewn well at all. I would have gladly paid double for the same one I got before."
2.0,Ears fall off. Sewed each of them back on
2.0,I'm only giving a lower review because I was looking for a pink golf hat for a tournament for my boyfriend and this is advertised as pink black and white but when you receive it is a red Henley print.  Not pink in any way
2.0,"Sent back, material was so thin you could see right though it, this was bought for a 14 year old, she didn‚Äôt even want to put it on"
2.0,"I wear a XL normally, ordered an XL and it fits okay but isn't flattering. I recommend if you wanted to hang on you like it does the model in the picture order two sizes bigger. The ""dress"" is very short, if you where to raise your hand it was reveal the bottom of your arse, same with any bending.<br />the material is not nearly as nice (soft nor silky) as the picture makes it look, the print is still kind of nice and is sown in well enough. The belt that comes with it is too short, at best it can be tied in a small bow. This dress is more like a kimono, I might even wear it that way instead, which is unfortunate."
2.0,Very thin sole. Very light  - an additional star for that.
2.0,"They're more like a thong to me because every time I moved, I had to pull them out of my crack I am not into butt floss! No thank you I am RETURNING them."
2.0,"The shorts are ok, but I guess I didn't notice when I ordered that they only have one pocket. Only one pocket is almost useless. I'll be returning them."
2.0,"It is cute don't get me wrong, but if you're around a size 4 or can go between a small and medium in most clothes even the large won't fit you."
2.0,"The tope fit fine but I could not get the bottoms on. I am a size 3-5 on bottoms, so the bottom was way too small. I am 5‚Äô5 and weigh around 115."
2.0,While I love the way this turned out I was not satisfied with the purchase. I ordered this to attach to my wedding bouquet when I received my first package I only received the charm and the glasslike top no adhesive strip or photo resizing information was included. I reached out to the company to ask about how to get the resizing information and they say they couldn‚Äôt find my order. After a few back and forth emails they gave me access to the resizing information.<br />I requested an exchange because my order didn‚Äôt include the adhesive material. I received the exchange the day before my wedding and again no adhesive material was included. I needed up returning the replacement and using superglue to adhere the glasslike top to the charm.<br /><br />Even though my experience with this product was not great I did love how it turned out.
2.0,"This umbrella does not stand up to moderate wind.  Also, the handle has an anoying tendency to unscrew from the stalk. Its only virtue is that it is compact and light."
2.0,They are not one size fits all. Had to give them to my grandkids.
2.0,They shrunk in the wash and are now too small for my son
2.0,Picture of this is super cute but when I tried it on it looked terrible on me. Guess it's better for perfectly proportioned ladies. I unfortunately have too large of  a waist and breasts for this to work for me. Bummer.
2.0,I'm a big guy but the 4xl fit more like a 2xl.
2.0,"I should have read the description. This is just a bag NOT a gym bag. No side pockets for gym shoes, dirty clothes, hygiene products etc. Just a very basic single compartment bag at an expensive price compared to gym bags on the market."
2.0,"The feathers are to short and small, not exactly as the picture"
2.0,Does not seem good quality.
2.0,"I ordered the black and red pairs but I received the only black pairs.  Also, I only received one card with description instead of three for each pair.  I would have liked to give it to my friends with the card included."
2.0,The frog and the cat both broke within a week of normaly ware.
2.0,"Loved the wallet, functional and affordable but the spring broke within 3 months of use."
2.0,It looks cool on picture and like how it looks but I didn‚Äôt get the same feeling once I had it. It feels too large and uncomfortable. Idk I'm just gonna keep it maybe wash it and see how it feels.
2.0,"While this set is very pretty, the earrings arrived with the posts broken off. The necklace was undamaged and worth the $15 I paid though."
2.0,"Way too small.. had to give it to my daughter. I ordered a 3XL when I normally wear only a 2XL, the sweater was way too short and wouldn't close."
2.0,"i'm returning this.  i'm short (5' tall) and this is just too much fabric on such a short frame.  i ordered a small and a medium.  the small is better but the  arms are quite tight, and still too much fabric around the torso/hips for me to be able to pull it off.  i could see this looking nice on someone considerably taller.  sweater was soft and the colors were nice.  quality seemed good too."
2.0,i am sadden this purchase did not meet my expectations.  i do not believe they should be rated as sweatpants. someone has taken an extreme liberty with the term SWEATPANTS.  l will not buy them again.
2.0,Ordered these shirts and wore them only once for a workout. After washing I noticed a bunch of snags all over these shirts. It seems the material is so thin that the shirt snags very easily even when just put thru a wash. They are workout shirts so its not a huge deal but the quality was a let down.
2.0,This band looks great but the latch design is terrible.  They send a tiny little screwdriver with it that you have  to use to release the latch each time you want to take it off.  The latch is also difficult to put back together and lock in place.  We sent this one back.
2.0,The material was thin. I don‚Äôt think it really provide any safety.  I would not recommend it. It took a long time to get here. I would stay away from things that come from China.
2.0,"UPDATE: 7/27/17<br />Although I had quality issues with the set I ordered I would not hesitate to purchase a different model from this company due to the great customer service I received over the past two days. This company stands behind their products! I was offered a replacement set or full refund without hassle. I opted for the refund due to the bad experience I had the first time. I didn't have any confidence that a new set of the same model wouldn't have the same issues outlined in my initial review. I also want a luggage set with TSA approved locks. The refund was processed quickly and received before the estimated date. I appreciate the level of service I received and will consider other models/luggage sets from this company in the future.<br /><br />Let's start with the positive! The luggage looks great, prime shipping, and value price point. I really like the red color and it makes it easier to spot at baggage claim. The luggage set came last week and this was my first time using it. Unfortunately, the handle broke on two out of the three bags before we even got to the airport this morning. I carried the largest peice by the side handle down my steps this morning and it just snapped off. The handle on the middle size piece snapped as I was lifting it to get off the shuttle on the way to the airport. Very disappointing way to start your vacation. I hope the other handles last until I get back home. I gave it two stars because of the color and the super smooth wheels. I hope the return process is not a hassle. I'm glad I saved the huge box they were shipped in."
2.0,"Overall I'm happy with this purchase. It keeps the Switch protected, and that's what I bought it for.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the product we received smells horribly of cigarette smoke and/or chemicals. We are a non-smoking family, and that's why we're mostly disappointed. The second we opened the box, we could smell it. I've tried to use sprays to mask the smell, but it's hard. I have used it once because we needed to, but it's been sitting g out trying to get the smell to leave since then.<br />I wouldn't buy again just because I'm worried another product would smell the same.<br />If it didn't smell of smoke and chemicals, I would've given a 4 star review."
2.0,Made my ears hurt and the back of them are plastic and not an actual back of earring. Disappointment for sucha great deal
2.0,The cat hanging down is tiny.
2.0,"His did not provide much support at all. The image shows a larger chest, which I have. However, it didn‚Äôt do much to hold anything up. I returned it."
2.0,"Cute, thin and runs super small.<br />I wear a medium in everything I own, the medium barely fit my arms.<br />Size up 2 sizes if you want a baggy fit."
2.0,"Very poor material. Also unexpectedly heavy! :(<br /> I'm so disappointed, especially since the design looks fine (the 2 stars are only for the design). If only they had used a slightly better quality material, it would be a pretty nice jacket I'd wear in much more places and company. But this? Not so.<br />It's also a bit small. Certainly not an XL."
2.0,Don‚Äôt bother washing. I made mistake of putting in washing machine in cold water and hang drying and it still shrunk. Bought another one and hand washed in cold water and it still shrunk. What a shame. It‚Äôs cute but only if you don‚Äôt mind wearing smelly clothes. Don‚Äôt buy
2.0,"I bought a 2x did not fit me, did not fit my sz large daughter, it fits my 10 yr old grand daughter..  cute teeshirt tho."
2.0,The logo/picture is blurry and pixilated making it look extra cheap  üëéüèº
2.0,These are thin and uncomfortable.  Not as outdoor resistant either
2.0,"Flimsy and cheap.  You can find similar for half price, they just don't say &#34;Genuine Vintage Bond.&#34;"
2.0,Did not like that Pearls fell off as I was walking!!!!!!! USE stronger GLUE PLEASE
2.0,Arrived folded. Very pretty hat. Will be hard to remove the creases.
2.0,"Good, but not beautiful."
2.0,The ring is beautiful but the stones are very lose and feel like they are going to fall out.
2.0,"They looked good when they arrived, in decent packaging. But the threads are very low quality and I've swallowed 3 different balls and 1 bar while eating"
2.0,Very tight and small.  I have a 7 1/4 head and this is very restricting.  Also incredibly thin.  The inside is not fleece and does not keep your ears warm on a cold day.  More suited for 45-50 degrees.  This is more a kids hat.
2.0,"I ordered this dress in &#34;mild purple.&#34; The colors are vibrant and beautiful. And that's where the good things end. The back is lower than my bra, so I can't wear a regular bra with it, and the bottom portion of the dress is completely see through. The neckline comes up too high and feels awkward and uncomfortable, and the belt is in a weird position between my bust and waistline. The material feels cheap and flimsy. I will be returning ASAP."
2.0,It did not say it was going to be 3/4 quarter length so it looked like I was a child wearing them you know having pants that are too small and are like pedal pushers that is pretty much what this was
2.0,"ugh - I waited for it for so long because I really wanted some turquoise earrings, but they are ugly.  But the couple dollars I paid for it are not worth the return..."
2.0,Waaaay to big even for my round face!
2.0,Sent it back. I did repurchase though.The dress looked/felt a lot cheaper in person than what was pictured. I'm sure I can alter what I don't like. Overall it was an okay but :)
2.0,They wouldn't stay up.
2.0,This dress was very poor quality. The waist is cut so strange it is very unflattering. I got an XL which was a size larger than I measured and it was still too small. I‚Äôm returning this item.
2.0,"Overall they are made well, very soft and the inside is quite plush. However they are extremely small.  I bought them for my spouse, he wears a 8.5 , I bought the size up and they were still way too small, they fit him more like a 7.5 would.  If you purchase, buy at least 2 sizes up."
2.0,It is way to hard to put on.  Needs magnet clasp.  Only wore it once!
2.0,"I did not like this shirt, tighter than I expected and it was not the quality I expected."
2.0,"I should have read reviews before buying. It was already broken when I took it out of the package. I tried to fix it by tying the ends. Worked for maybe 10 minutes of walking, and before I knew it, another part of the ankle bracelet broke. Color and style is nice, but really poor quality."
2.0,Does not look like the pic! Way to big!  Weird  Material
2.0,Wore this watch for less than two weeks and it quit working.
2.0,Rings were small and kinda flimsy
2.0,"The tag says it's 100% cotton but it is a very dense, stretchy material like lycra/spandex and feels nothing like a nice soft, cotton tee.  I kept them (probably more out of laziness than anything), but I expected them to be able to sleep in them. I'm sure they aren't very breathable, so I don't know how much they'll actually be worn.  They also say not to put them in the dryer!  I refuse to buy tshirts for kids/teens that can't be dried, therefore we will soon find out how these hold up, because I'm washing them now. :)"
2.0,I regret ordering these as they are cheaply made and very thin. I can see the color of my skin through the sock. All three pair will have fallen apart long before a single pair of gold toe socks start to wear. I wasted my money.
2.0,"Very light, almost seems cheap, but you get what you pay for"
2.0,I bought this for my daughter to wear on Easter and it did not fit her head at all. It kept falling off so we had to return it. It was very disappointing because it was adorable. I'm not sure what shape had this fits.
2.0,"These are pretty. I bought for the very nice white bandana pattern. I cycle every day in super hot sunny weather. The sun burns.<br />I have quite average arms for a female, not too thin, not bulked up.<br />FIRST: The arm covers are made of that shiny slippery material like cheap shower curtains.<br />They slip down the arm and constantly need hitching up.<br />This is due to the shiny slippery material. Ihave other arm covers which don't do this made from elasticky material.<br /><br />SECOND: They are very thin and don't keep out sun. I got a slight reddening on the arms when I wore the white ones<br /><br />Is this harmful UV rays? Don't know. I don't want any kind of tan safe or not. I don't really trust these to keep out rays. I have to return them. I love the pattern but no way are they a good fit, good material which stays up.<br />Plus they are REALLY hot and the material is not superstretchy like many other brands. I don't know how they're classes as cooling."
2.0,"These are small, I ordered the adult size and only my 14 yr old daughter can wear them."
2.0,Would have loved this product but the straps are too far separated so they feel like they are constantly falling off your shoulders. I ended up having my husband cut holes in the cups and now it makes a great hands free pumping bra!
2.0,Sizing way off. Doesn‚Äôt look like the photos.
2.0,Cut small for a medium
2.0,"Don‚Äôt recommend, i bought it just because of the design :)"
2.0,"Honestly, the texture is nothing like what I expected. Some of the hair pieces feel and look as if they‚Äôve been blow dried, while other pieces have that natural Afro look you want. Hard to explain but in the picture the fro looks nice & round & manageable, well it isn‚Äôt. And you can‚Äôt successfully make it round because it‚Äôs super flimsy and feels silky. Very disappointed"
2.0,It didnt fit very well.. as soon as you start sweating it showed up and stained the hat.
2.0,"Multiple pairs have fallen apart after one wear. Post came separated from earring when trying to remove back. If you don‚Äôt mind to repair with superglue then ok to purchase... cute and trendy at a good price, quality is lackluster"
2.0,Pretty but smells like insect spray. Put on the back porch for two days and hope the smell will fade.
2.0,It did not specify that it only goes halfway up the calf. the picture makes it lool as though they are knee-highs but they are not. I will not be able to use them.
2.0,It‚Äôs so thin that it‚Äôs transparent. The sleeves were threadbare.
2.0,It‚Äôs black and orange not black and red....
2.0,"My husband usually wears a ten &  a half size shoes , I‚Äôm responsible for  his care‚Ä¶ It was advised to me to buy him  a little bigger size  so they would slide on his feet a little easier ,so I bought him a size 11 ,thinking that would work!  These shoes are almost impossible to get on him ! After  struggling for about 8 to 10 minutes on each foot,  I managed to get his feet in them. However if I have to go through this every time he‚Äôs going to wear them , well , it just seems it will be impossible!  This was supposed to make my life a little easier and his a little dryer while being transported out in the rain.<br /> I think I would‚Äôve had to buy at least two sizes bigger to get his feet in the hole at the opening and then they would‚Äôve been too big on him throughout the rest of the shoe."
2.0,The neck strap was too short so the penis part is almost at my chest lol. Other than that the quality is pretty good for the price I paid. Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again sorry.
2.0,Way to small more for an infant than a 8-year old
2.0,"very very low quality fabric & a little bit see through. The cut is a little bit weird, too."
2.0,Ordered the exact same size for two children & they were clearly different sizes
2.0,It didn't look like it did on line.
2.0,"The lace is pretty good quality. Fits like a size 4 without give for a hippy size 4. Definitely do not buy if you have a curvier shape OR if you are larger than a size Small. Should have known when no size was indicated, but I was hoping that meant the lace had a LOT of stretch. It doesn't."
2.0,"gave it two stars instead of one for the simple fact that it is a stylish coat. only problem is that the lining is an extremely thin nylon, ripped inside the sleeves and pockets (both) within  two days of wearing it."
2.0,You can maybe use a collar extender once and then its pretty much worthless.
2.0,"Its ok I guess. I bought it to wear with my Halloween costume, but wasn't to impressed with it so ended up not wearing it. I probably won't ever wear it, but hey, it was cheap so I suppose I got what I paid for!"
2.0,I didn't like anything about this item too small üòï
2.0,I would like to say that the Okabashi's Men's Glide Sandals were not made as well as expected. These sandals have a built in arch. The arch on the left foot was as hard as a rock and was much bigger and higher than the arch on the right foot. I could not ware these sandals they hurt my feet.  Okabashi has no observation of the product and what is sent out to the customer. I would not buy this product again for fear of having to package them up and mail them back.
2.0,"Very uncomfortable, they slide around while walking and I got a huge blister in between my toe. I gave them away."
2.0,"We got these as a gift- they‚Äôre SUPER CUTE and my (almost) 5yo LOVES THEM. But, we‚Äôve only had them for a month and a half and they‚Äôre wrecked. She plays but isn‚Äôt incredibly hard on her shoes, everything else up to this point has been in good enough condition to hand down. Definitely would not recommend."
2.0,"This jacket fits very strange. I ordered a large and the arm length seems very small and it makes it very uncomfortable to wear. I bought a different pattern from same seller, same size and it fits perfect but this one‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I will ever wear it"
2.0,I'm usually a size xlg. But this was way too small. The material was not comfortable and fore arms were ill fitted
2.0,"This would have been a nice shirt, but it is not an American size, so far too small-and the color was more like copper although I ordered silver."
2.0,The chain is very poorly made. Broke 3 times until we gave up and bought a better one.
2.0,"Very oversized, had to return. Too bad but the price was right."
2.0,Not what I expected.  Isn't adjustable in enough places so it's either too high or too low there is no middle ground.  Not comfortable at all.
2.0,I personal feel that the watch set wasn't as I expected. The battery in the watch wasn't working had to purchase one for it. Some of the colors weren't what I wanted. I haven't seen an watch set without having the basic colors. No black.
2.0,Looks flimsy. Would avoid.
2.0,"Is slightly more difficult to put on than other support stockings I have. The comfort in the ankle and foot area is very good and better than most, however the very top is a problem. I don't know what is in the very top band but if I wear these all day they leave a thin red sore area as if I'm allergic to them. If I fold the top over so a layer of the sock is between the top edge and my leg I don't have this problem, though it is tighter when I do this. No where near as bad as the moisturizing copper fit socks."
2.0,Checked the sizing chart before ordering and this was still WAY smaller than the size listed for my measurements. Couldn‚Äôt even get the snaps to reach one another to close the suit. It also has a ribbed texture that doesn‚Äôt show in the product photo which was unexpected. It was listed as stretchy but has extremely limited stretch if any at all. Definitely a return.
2.0,Material was awesome but the cut and fit where is subpar had purchased an extra large and it's fitted as if it was a medium
2.0,These are the only pair of cat eye sunglasses I have ever purchased. I don't have anything that looks them. They are very different from normal sunglasses. They kind of look cute but still a little odd...One thing I don't like is that I can't see my eyebrows... That is a little strange looking. These sunglasses do block the sun rays and help keep my eyes safe from bright light.<br />Disclosure: I was able to get these glasses free
2.0,I was not impressed at all with these ‚Äúpajamas‚Äù. I purchased them to use as part of a Halloween costume and they served their purpose for that but my original intention was to keep them as pajamas for my daughter after Halloween. They definitely don‚Äôt work for that. The material is really thin and scratchy and they just don‚Äôt make for cozy pajamas at all. The mane and the horn are very flat and unimpressive. I‚Äôve purchased  other one piece pajamas for my daughters in the same price range and they were of far better quality than these.
2.0,Pretty but the quality of the fabric is very poor. It pilled after wearing it twice.
2.0,The pockets are very unflattering and make your hips look extra wide. The dress is also super thin. I‚Äôm returning it.
2.0,The belt is nice but the dial is so weird looking! I would take the dial out and wear the belt as wrist band instead!!
2.0,Weird shape. Sewn uneven. Peplum is awkward
2.0,Did not fit as expected..not worth it.
2.0,im little over 100 pounds and these are still pretty tight on me
2.0,The paint peeled off the second day. I had paint flakes all over my neck from the necklace
2.0,Very itchy. Very thick and makes my face sweat bad
2.0,"The hat is of fine quality, very well made, but be sure it is what you want before ordering. Returning it is expensive.  You have to pay mailing plus a restocking fee.  By the time you do this it becomes very expensive, Wouldn't do it again. Stick with Amazon things and not things from 3rd party people."
2.0,"I love the way these fit and the feel of them but I‚Äôm very unhappy with the way they are holding up. I‚Äôve worn these twice, today being the second day and the seam on the side has unraveled and I now have hole in side. Very very upset about this."
2.0,Wait until you see the inside. Electric orange. If you take that into a meeting your clients will think you should be locked up.  Orange is not the new black.  Anyone want mine.
2.0,delayed shipping; not the sellers fault; but aggravating to say the least; the strap broke when I tried it on; had to sew it back on; I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it was too small in the waist; around the top I had to take it in 2 inches; I wish it had had a bit of extra material at the waist to let it out for a better fit; it was very wrinkled and I had to iron it several times.
2.0,"It had patterns on the robe that were not in the photo of this item and are not like Tanjiro's. If you want to cosplay, this is not the item."
2.0,"This product has such potential. It does exactly what I need it to do--which is have a vibrating alarm go off for my son several times a day. It says it's waterproof--and it was. For less than a month. He didn't go scuba diving--it was a bath and then I saw it--condensation under the face. For $40, this thing should last. If Timex made a product that had more alarms, I would have gone that direction. My Timex sport watches last forever."
2.0,Hate to iron. My fault for ordering 100% cotton. Also too small
2.0,They were comfortable but they stretched out while wearing them and looked to big!'
2.0,"The length of this dress seems to be very inconsistent. I‚Äôm not tall (5‚Äô4‚Äù) and I usually buy pants with 30‚Äù inseam if I‚Äôm wearing them with tennis shoes. This dress is at least 2 inches above my ankles. I was not expecting it to be that short. I wish it was a lot longer because it‚Äôs a cute dress. The length is just very awkward. The rest of the dress fit fine, even the top. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 149-145 lbs, and wear 34F/G (DDDD) bra."
2.0,Cute but low quality. Don't stay up.
2.0,Material is poly and looks cheap
2.0,"Cute shirt, but... Either glue or some of the print ink was on the front of the shirt... Bummed."
2.0,Not s long as portrayed on model.
2.0,The fabric is very thin and sheer and the size is too small.  I will be returning the items.
2.0,"Since these are compression socks, they are tight and the dots are individually sewn onto the socks. It will leave your calves and feet with little dots which are quite itchy. Go with the stripes one, they work just as well and do not leave compression dots."
2.0,It‚Äôs a good quality work but the dress runs 2 sizes smaller. I wear xl and ordered 2XL to be on a safe side but when the dress arrived my daughter who wears size M could barely fit in it.
2.0,"They look nice, they feel nice, but they came cracked by the nose. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the glasses themself or the other stuff but it‚Äôs cracked."
2.0,"This product should not been introduced to the market. Unfortunately it has a missing letter, I would guess it was made in a country where English isn‚Äôt their main communication language so they didn‚Äôt notice or if they noticed they ignored it because it‚Äôs already made (which is worst than a first scenario). In both instances item shouldn‚Äôt be sold to English speakers like that because it just looks funny and cheap. Main picture shows it to, the ‚ÄúL‚Äù in FEEL is gone. I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because it fits ok but the lettering ruins any further point of evaluation‚Ä¶ I hope that helps!"
2.0,Foot bed comes apart and little pieces all over the house! Had no idea it was the little rubber squares around the house were from the flip flops
2.0,"It was very uncomfortable to wear, eye holes are too small and irritate your eyes when you blink.  Then I accidentally snapped it in two when I sat down with it in my front (not rear) pocket, meaning just the tension of my pants was enough to snap it, not even like sitting on it.  Weak and cheap, but didn't expect anything else."
2.0,The print of the flag was very light. Not at all like in the pic.
2.0,Way to small!  They need to make larger pouches.  Fabric is nice!
2.0,"The watch is so cute. The gold isnt the gold that I like. It's like a yellow gold and it looks like it will tarnish quickly , but I'm not sure."
2.0,"These are basically the type of slippers you would buy at your local drug store for $8-10. The memory foam, if there is any, is paper thin. It also seems that the arch support is on the outside of the foot rather than on the inside and I checked to be sure I had them on the right foot. Theses are not worth the money."
2.0,"Too snug, not enough ""give"" in the material used IMO"
2.0,"They're not big enough..I ordered them thinking they'd be Lolita..they were average. Prompt shopping though, and no complaints in quality"
2.0,fits fat
2.0,"I probably should have gone with my instincts on these.  They dowright hurt between my toes where they are sewn together.  I even looked to see if I could clip a thread and release the toe, but it is sewn down pretty tight, so would probably fray.  I am sure these would work fine for shorter feet and they don't slip off the heel.  I wear a 9 US.  I do like the colors and the material, but somewhere it said up to size 9 and they pull too much between the toes.  Maybe my granddaughter, size 7 US,  can wear them, or my oldest daughter, as she only wears a size 6 US.  I don't feel like I can return as I got a little smudge on the pair I tried."
2.0,We all make mistakes at some point in our lives.  Buying the Younsea 42mm Milanese watch band was one of mine.  I can not adjust the links to get a proper fit.  Removing one link is too loose and removing two links is way too tight.  In addition the unhooking method is very cumbersome/difficult and time consuming. Maybe even impossible since the watch band continually slides off ones wrist while attempting to &#34;hook&#34; the very small latch.  Otherwise the fit and finish appears to be good.
2.0,"These are cute,I ordered a large even tho I usually wear a med. they say on the tag that they are extra large but are very small...very small...."
2.0,"Photo is misleading, snarky customer service, long ship time, overpriced. The item it self is fine."
2.0,Not what I expected‚Äô stitching is off‚Äô size up‚Äô
2.0,We couldn‚Äôt stop laughing at my husband. He literally could pull the pants up over his head they were so odd shaped and high waisted. The kids fit relatively well but the adult ones were way off.
2.0,"I should have read the product line a LOT closer. These are great cut, a little big but not enough not to wear, but do not breath for your body parts (which is very important for women). If they were a more breathable fabric then I would give more stars."
2.0,This is a really cute top I ordered an extra large but it's more like a medium it's not flowy at all and it is like swimsuit material. I'm disappointed.
2.0,Well first the picture look better than what I got. The colors is not the same and is light green.<br />I guess it‚Äôs fine for the price .<br />I will use it but I am not happy with the purchase.
2.0,"This shirt is very long and the neckline droops down very low. Too low. The shirt doesn't look much at all like it does on the model. But more like the pictures of the shirt that look like it's on a mannequin. You can really see how long it is in the back especially and the very low neckline. Bottom line, I do not find his shirt flattering at all."
2.0,I really wanted to like this bra.  My complain is that there is very little room for shoulder strap adjustment.  I couldn't get the straps short enough to fit properly without falling off my shoulders.
2.0,Shorts fit great. Shirt is huge
2.0,"They were too small for my son, but I did give them away to another boy"
2.0,"the little flippy bits like to come loose, and i've tightened them back up, but they just really wanna be flappy. if not for that, i'd love these to BITS."
2.0,Chest/neck part comes up higher than expected. I'm a medium size 6 in most things yet this Large is tight and sleeves are above my wrist bones. Thought this could work for civil ceremony but no thanks.
2.0,The lime-colored shirt is partially transparent. Can clearly see my white bra and my belly button underneath. Unwearable. I'm returning it.
2.0,I did not like how it fit on my stomach- I bought it with the hope of hiding it a bit and it did the opposite.
2.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. The quality of the fabric was surprisingly good for the price.<br /><br />I have found that many of the inexpensive dresses from China on Amazon run small, and that you need to buy up a size as a matter of practice.<br /><br />However this one fit so snug in the butt, hips, and thighs, you might even want to go up two sizes."
2.0,Small in areas. Not flexible going over your bust don‚Äôt have wiggle room
2.0,Second hand fell off in 30 minutes on 1st use.
2.0,So the band itself is beautiful and the magnetic closure works well. So well in fact that instead of giving way the pins would come out of the watch face. I had to return it. Anytime I bent my wrist too much the pins would pop out. It came with 3 original and with a weeki had lost 2 because it kept falling off. Fix the pins and you would have a great product.
2.0,"Junky, the chain broke when taking it out of the box"
2.0,"If you wear a large or are big busted,  get an  xl. Also material isn't great."
2.0,"Cute, but runs at least two sizes too small."
2.0,This bra is HUGE!!!  it barely fits in my bra drawer!!  I'm scared to put it on
2.0,I was disappointed because the chain with the initial and heart was very off center and the infinity chain hangs very low. The idea was great but the execution was poorly done.
2.0,"I wasnt impressed at all with these glasses, The lenses were SO hard to remove from the frame and it was very difficult to remove without breaking the frame. I would buy Dior. I have went through may a frame, and Dior makes the best frames hands down."
2.0,The skirt fits great. The main issue I have is that it looks pale like it‚Äôs been washed multiple times. The color is nothing like the vivid picture they have. For this reason it looks too cheap and I will not be able to wear it.
2.0,I was really hoping to love these pants because they are very cute but they are super  tight on my normal sized 4month old.
2.0,looks good on the body. But the piping is too raised and cheapens the dress.
2.0,"Doesn't fit like a charm should fit, the sticker or paper heart inside is off center and some of the words are cut off. Also, the cover of the heart was very dirty and wouldn't get off. I was very disappointed"
2.0,"The swim suit fit as expected. I was bummed when I had to send it back after the zipper broke the second time wearing it. The seller seems to have gave no hassle, but they couldn‚Äôt have anyway... I had it for less than a week before I was returning it. It‚Äôs purpose was for water aerobics. I was complimented on the look and fit of it on the first time wearing it."
2.0,These fit as expected until the first wash and dry.  I purchased 2 pairs and they both shrunk at least 2-3 inches.  Washed/dried according to label.
2.0,You must Wash before use else you will be covers in Blue Lint and Fuzz. Kinda fits me short for 5'11 but I only have it on for Bed or Shower so its not of a bother. 6 feet tall buy a size Up! XXL
2.0,"I just received the item and tried it out, and when it was time to zip it. I noticed that kept catching on something. I would like another one, and probably a bigger size because the medium fits good, but i would like to have a large to fit comfortably."
2.0,Artificial beads/stones. Color is wearing off since coated in colored paint. Dissapointed.
2.0,I took one look and returned it! Its huge! I am normaly between an L and an Xl and I figure with the clingy material it would be safer to go with xl...its huge an L would have been more than enough. Not doing a curvey figure any justice and the material is super see-through! Looks more like a nightgown honestly.
2.0,"I really like the size and style...However,  it will not stay closed!  I often look down and find it hanging open on my shoulder!!!  It also has lots of loose threads across the top!  So disappointed!"
2.0,I loved the earrings but the drop one has broken off the top part alreadyüòû
2.0,"These pants are loud, I sound like a walking washing machine. My legs rub and all my coworkers know I'm up and aboutüôÑ. I really wanted to love them but the material is cheap, feels like a stiff PJs pants. The stripes are not aligned as the pic which is annoying. My stripes look like a child assembled my garment. They are garbage for the price. Overpriced PJs."
2.0,"I thought this would be cuter than it was.  The strings were coming undone and the sleeves are way shorter than expected.  Unfortunately, i will be sending this back.  I order black, XL and it looked navy and about a size medium.  I ordered a size up thinking it would fit, but i was mistaken."
2.0,Looked like a nightgown on me. Not for people that aren‚Äôt super skinny. Super short too. Mine also come with what looked like an oil spot right on the front.
2.0,"Somewhat smaller than I expected.  I have curves, and I really really had to stretch my dress to fit my curves."
2.0,"Was happy when I received them, right away noticed they were a little different but it wasn't a problem. Tried them on my 5m old and they were huge, she is in the 50th percentile so she is average for size, they stretched out WAY to easily. I feel like I just wasted my money."
2.0,"very soft fabric, but it was too small.  I gave it to my sister who usually wears size large."
2.0,not happy as I looked at one to try it on and there is a hole in the crotch of one
2.0,I usually wear a medium for clothes from the reviews I decided to get a small because it seems like it runs big but the small fit like a large ! I'll be returning this item.
2.0,"The sweater size was very small, dull looking black and did not look like the sweater in the picture."
2.0,A little fake looking but other than that nice red color.
2.0,Boys shorts need stretch AND a tie string.  When my 4 year is swimming the shorts shimmy down and reveal his bum!  Not good!
2.0,it did not fit as expected the pockets each had a medium size hole in them.
2.0,"Weird fit, too long as I knew they would be but the waist wAs tight. Returned"
2.0,"Considering the price, it's not too bad<br />Looks like a steampunk/gears in the picture, but it's just a picture of gears with a plastic cover."
2.0,Lovely top. Size was to small. I chose XL but no way XL
2.0,"I'm 5'7.5 and weigh 123lbs and ordered a size small. The dress was way too big around my wait but wait too tight around my butt. It was also very short. Nice material, but did not fit correctly"
2.0,"I so badly wants to like this dress :( Nothing has ever made my butt look flatter and you could see the outline of every part of my thigh even though it was loose. It made my body look so frumpy, I can‚Äôt even tell you and I‚Äôm a thin person. I‚Äôll give it 2 stars bc it‚Äôs comfy and the fabric is soft. Maybe if you‚Äôre curvy it‚Äôd fit better. I looked like sponge bob square pants."
2.0,"This watch was smaller than expected. As a 6'6"" 270lb man, this watch looks like a toy on me, but this is not why I am leaving two stars.<br /><br />To me this watch should do 3 things. Tell me the date, tell me the time, and have a quality back-light. The time an date are perfect. But the backlight is not the full screen on some other name brand watches. It is a small, weak light on the far left of the face that only really illuminates the hour and not the minute. As someone who checks what time it is while laying in bed, this was a let down.<br /><br />For 10 bucks, it would make a good watch for a kid or wife to have a burner watch, but that is it. In my opinion, go with the 30 dollar casios that arent knockdown models."
2.0,"cheaply made, very thin leather"
2.0,"They are dark, but durability not so good, they were 1 week shy of 2 months in use when they broke at the hinges. I would leave them on the console of my van in the open position until I would need them so I don't think they were subjected to excessive wear and tear. They were a bit tight to wear but not uncomfortable so maybe my head is to big for the design."
2.0,No disrespect but I‚Äôm not 100% sure these are real g star jeans that‚Äôs all I wear as far as jeans and they have weird tags on them I‚Äôve never seen before and they fit a little loose.. is that why they are cheaper than the website? Lol
2.0,"Not fleece sweat pants, too thin! Will be returning."
2.0,Looked cheap in person. Was disappointed
2.0,The shirt was really big. The shirts fit true to size.
2.0,"I read so many good reviews before purchasing these, but they just didn't fit.  I've ordered other face masks in medium that fit, so I was surprised when these didn't.  I was hoping that both my husband and I could use them since they were adjustable, but the adjustable strings were very snug on me when they were at their largest, so they are way too small for my husband.  The biggest problem was they would pull down under my nose whenever I opened my mouth.  I liked that they had a place for an extra filter, the material was fine, just wished they fit an average size face.  I returned them."
2.0,Very large for a 1x.  Material looks cheap.
2.0,Not what i expected.. looks like stone fits down inside of mounting.. will return for a different style.<br /> But it is marked sterling silver.. theyre pretty but not style i was looking for.
2.0,"Not quite what I expected, but, it'll work for me!"
2.0,Too flimsy and felt like it would break easily.
2.0,So happy I decided to open the package when I did because a pair of earrings was missing that did it for me I just sent them package back the same way I received it only giving 1 star
2.0,"Colors more bright than the picture. Tried them on but haven't worn them yet. Dont really like them, thinish fabric, they are soft textured though. Still not learning my lesson about buying cheap clothes off amazon!!"
2.0,If it had pockets I'd keep it and wear it with capris but otherwise is worthless to me.
2.0,This is a nice item if it serves your needs; but I bought it so I could slip it over my wrist for security purposes while shopping.  The strap was flimsy and broke the first time I used it rendering it useless to me for the reason I bought it.
2.0,This watch strap is very beautiful but it is SO THICK that it makes it unwearable. I recommend getting another strap
2.0,Zipper broke after one beach vacation. Loved it until that happened.
2.0,I don't have overly large legs and normally I can just order even over the knee socks without having to worry about them being too small. These however are SO tight that I tried to wear them scrunched down over hiking boots and they left marks on my upper ankle/lower calf. Pulling them up they didn't come to the bottom of my knee and were very uncomfortable. They're thin which is great for the summer (think those newborn tights that are really thick) but if you're planning to wear them with shoes that fit with a thicker cotton or cotton blend sock you will have your shoes sliding up and down.
2.0,"Too heavy - zipper pulls and carabiner clip make it too heavy, then add your key fob and keys to it, it is a heavy weight in your purse or bag. Product is functional, color of leather and zippers are dull, unlike the photo shown on Amazon. I thought I was getting pink, the product was more of a washed out peach color. I don't recommend. Manufacturer has improvement opportunities."
2.0,"Look nice but the Velcro on the strap was not long enough to secure the strap over my foot. Thus, I can‚Äôt wear them. They are too loose"
2.0,It‚Äôs always a 50/50 shot of getting decent clothes on here. Material is not flannel in fact it‚Äôs silky and extremely thin. Not a fall shirt at all. My colors were ok but not what I was expecting. I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits across my chest but the bottom hangs loose and is not fitted as shown in the pic. The sleeves are huge so I just rolled it up ... and used the button on the sleeve. Stitching could be better
2.0,One week. Falling apart. Will not buy again
2.0,We ordered a large because the large size on the ethica website was our size but this large was way smaller.
2.0,"Los lentes giran, y las patas vinieron despegadas y tambi√©n giran."
2.0,size is small
2.0,feels really flimsly.  The cuts are inconsistent and awkward.  It just feels weird as a piece of compression apparel.  Like putting on a latex glove on your body.
2.0,"Pretty dress, but seeing the style in person and while wearing it, it leans more towards an older and maybe more conservative style of dress than I expected."
2.0,"The way the chain slides through the infinity sign results in a neclace that constantly falls off. Resolved that with pliers and a ring repurposed from the clasp to fix the chain to the infinity loop. Shipping took about 12 weeks. Past that, we got what you would expect at the price. Not jewelry of the quality you would find at your local box store priced at $20 and marked down to $6."
2.0,Way too short. Not meant for someone with a long torso.
2.0,Item not as described and size is larger than expected.
2.0,"I liked the colors of the fabric but it was too long for me! I'm 5'4. Also the button is in the back, every time you need to go to the bathroom, you have to reach out to your back to undo it. I don't think that would be convenient for me."
2.0,"The pattern was exactly like the picture but the top had a draw string sort of tie that went over one shoulder, not what is shown in the picture. Also it fit well on the top and waist but the hip area looked like giant elephant ears flapping away on my sides-it was very odd."
2.0,I've only had them for a week and the lens has fallen out already. They are pretty loose on my head.  They are cute but not very durable.
2.0,"I am about 220lb, 5'5"" and apple shaped, so I've got a bigger tummy and slimmer legs. The fit on these was close to good on the legs, but still had a little too much space in the thighs. And I could get the pants on without much effort, but my tummy fat got pushed up so I had a muffin top where the slimmest/upper part of my waist had been prior to putting on the pants. If I was going to wear a big baggy shirt over these they would work, but I might as well buy regular denim stretch leggings. I hope this review helps you!"
2.0,"Knot in string started coming apart, and color on silver pendant changing faded after a month of wear."
2.0,"looks great, but won't keep the time. It is always slow."
2.0,Just received and was disappointed to see that there's no actual secure pocket for baby. Its just an extra piece of fabric over the opening of the sweatshirt. Baby could slip right down. Also the description said pull over but its a zip up. I will likely be returning.
2.0,"I used this lanyard for two weeks, and it broke. Nice looking but would not order again."
2.0,not at all what I expected.
2.0,I like the style but very cheap links
2.0,Washed it once (before I wore it the first time) and there's a tiny hole in it already.  Really disappointed.
2.0,"Well, the necklace and charm itself is okay for the price...but the ""heart"" just looks like a hole..."
2.0,"Super cheap, see through and the thread was falling apart."
2.0,It feels like it's going to fall off you..
2.0,somewhat large for Medium size top
2.0,"You should know already that this isn't a high-quality item.<br />- the chains and 'lace' are two separate colors<br />- 'lace' is a stiff, scratchy material that rolls/folds and won't lie flat<br />Looks okay from a distance and in low lighting, but doesn't hold up under any close inspection."
2.0,This belt is average at best. The paint on the buckle has already started coming off a day after I opened it! You get what you pay for and next time I would pay more to get something nicer. It will do the job for now!<br /><br />Edit: The seller did more than enough to fix the situation and I did not even ask them to! They stand behind their product even in my unfortunate situation...I would buy from them again!
2.0,"After washing this dress, one time, inside out, the front has got little snags all over it and the fabric looks pilled up.  I'm really disappointed in the fabric and myself for buying garbage."
2.0,Too long for a little girl of 4.  Also had to remove horn.  It looked like something obscene !
2.0,"I have several issues with this top:  1) The size runs small.  I'm normally a 14/16 and wear an XL.  The XL on this top was really tight through the shoulders and arms. 2) The fabric isn't very nice.  It feels like very thin upholstery fabric and doesn't feel good against the skin.  3) The shirt doesn't hang like it does in the photograph.  Rather than curving up at the sides, it's more triangular so it has a boxy hang.  4)  There are no loops on the blouse to keep the belt secured in place.  I am returning the top.  It's just not what I hoped it would be."
2.0,"This ring was not worth the price and I was very disappointed. I feel this ring was not up to the typical Pandora standards, the stones were not sparkly at all. I sent it back."
2.0,I was a lot longer than I thought it would be.
2.0,Mine was missing the glass. It only had the bezels.
2.0,"After wearing the band for few weeks, the ""hide"" finish  started to fall off."
2.0,They are soft heavier quality. Rubs a little bug but ok. My favorites.
2.0,"This long sleeve turtleneck dress is casual and can be worn during the fall with cooler weather. The turtleneck is low, more like a thicker neckline vs a true turtleneck that would cover your neck. The dress falls straight down your body, unlike the A-line mentioned in the description. I like having pockets on my dresses so I can carry simple things like a phone or my credit cards which makes it convenient. However the pockets droop on top towards the middle."
2.0,nothing personal it look cheap......
2.0,"I bought this neck chain because it looked great in the photos. But when I got it, I was disappointed in the size. It's too short for a &#34;real&#34; man's neck. And the links are HUGE! ...Weighs a ton...Looks more like something for S/M than a fashionable chain. Not for me."
2.0,"This bag doesn‚Äôt have a label of Louis Vuitton  imitation, I don‚Äôt like it"
2.0,"Way too small. Ordered size small for 5‚Äô tall, 100 lbs. it was so tight there was no breathing going on."
2.0,Review is in the title.
2.0,Within 2 days this product is already broken.. Not very well built
2.0,"Beautifully made, mail how ever knocked gem syons out and it mees tlc. Perhaps a box to mail it in will keep it safe"
2.0,I thought these were women's sized but I'm pretty sure they're junior sizes.
2.0,"The sweatshirt was a little too big, so I don't like it"
2.0,To small  around legs
2.0,"You would have to wear a tank or something under this, Material is way too thin."
2.0,Super thin polyester material
2.0,Not what I was expecting and I think it‚Äôs too small. I‚Äôm thinking about asking for a refund.<br /><br /> Save your money.
2.0,Ears weren‚Äôt very sturdy and now kept folding while I was wearing it.
2.0,Quality is average but sizes run small. Extra large might fit an extra large Oompa-Loompa .. but for homo sapiens it is more like medium.
2.0,Super cute but two broke after just one day or wear. Disappointing I really liked the look.
2.0,"Every once in a while I think these help me find a ball and i'm like &#34;wow these are awesome!&#34;. However, most of the time whomever i'm playing with will find the ball before me, and I'll look with and without these glasses and not notice much difference. Definitely not made to wear full time. Huge pain to switch back and forth between regular sunglasses. I fell for the gimmick."
2.0,Didn't even get a chance to wear it found a hole on the side of the dress very disappointed.  I was looking forward to be the spot light of the evening and couldn't..
2.0,Order XXL.  It was more like a medium with long sleeves.  Really bad sizing.
2.0,Order 3 sizes larger than you wear for a decent fit
2.0,I checked the size chart and it wasn‚Äôt what it said
2.0,"I ordered an XL, but it fits like a small. It‚Äôs soft , but the sizing is wayyy off. I usually wear a large, wanted this one to fit bigger, but I won‚Äôt be able to wear this since it fits like a XS/S."
2.0,shreds easily
2.0,There was a lot of heavy material between my legs. Not comfortable.
2.0,Necklace length is too short- it‚Äôs very hard to put on cause there‚Äôs no length
2.0,Item was much smaller than described. Had to return. Two stars for nice fabric and easy return.
2.0,We measured my boyfriend wrist many times to make sure this would be a good fit. We received it and it‚Äôs way to large.
2.0,I‚Äôm a size large but I ordered a sized xxl. It‚Äôs a little small. Ordered three size larger then your regular size
2.0,Flimsy.  Too large
2.0,All Tesla sports wear ripped for me. Buy Underarmour
2.0,Not exactly like the pic. Fabric is not that great and the lace top is awful
2.0,"Not compression.  Thin, flimsy, too short, not highly elastic.  No bra...<br /><br />Returning..."
2.0,"Wouldn‚Äôt buy again, not as presented."
2.0,the glasses are to small for me to wear
2.0,Not bad quality. I'm only returning these because it didn't look good on my face.
2.0,Fabric is nice. Length is good but the rest is way to small. I think about 2 to 3 sizes to small
2.0,I loved the stretch of the material but it is made for the size of men‚Äôs faces rather than women‚Äôs. That should be part of the name of the product so it is not misleading.
2.0,This is BS! When I saw the reviews the first time it had 4 stars and after I purchase it I come back and it‚Äôs 2 stars!!! How is this possible? Don‚Äôt buy these masks! Super cheap/thin!!
2.0,"I ordered the XL. I‚Äôve returned this due to the cut and fit. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù, and it came to my ankles, which just looks awkward. Not a very roomy skirt and top was tight, sleeves too. I ordered a similar dress, same size, and I was much more impressed by it. I‚Äôll order another of those in a different color. Plus side, decent fabric, not see through, would be warm for fall or a Florida winter. Could be perfect for a smaller lady, but I don‚Äôt recommend it for curvy girls."
2.0,"These are not put together well at all.  After only wearing them twice, one started falling apart."
2.0,Won't fit in ear
2.0,"My wife does a great deal of rose pruning this time of year - but the gloves were way too big to fit her small hands.  There was almost a full inch to spare between the end of her finger tips and the tips of the gloves.<br /><br />Although the company suggests that these gloves will fit both men and women, the truth is that they are large enough to fit the hands of a, +200lb 6' 3"" male (me) with room to spare.  I normally wear a 'large' size when it comes to work gloves and these gloves fit me."
2.0,"The color is pretty, but it is not made out of the material listed.  The one I got is more like a cotton stretch material.  Lots of wrinkles."
2.0,"Not nearly as pretty as the picture. The blue is much more faded and not as bright and vibrant as the picture wants you to believe. It is still a pretty shirt but very thin material and I didn't realize it but quite frankly the little corner thing that hangs in the front, it's weird and I didn't know what to do with it. I kept pulling at it, didn't know how to hang it properly and decided it was too strange. I was going to return it but my little 10 year old daughter loves it so I ended up giving it to her and it looks great. she is slghtly on the chubby side and it makes her look nicer in her thinner shirts. I'm not sure what the point of it is for an adult because it is too thin to be warm, too awkward with those corner things to feel comfortable in and the arms are too skinny and the material too thin to hide any unwanted chub. Maybe it would have if I had bought a larger size however it would still have been thin material."
2.0,"I tried a pair on and everything about these socks seems to be of top quality, except for where the bottom of shin curves to front of ankle, top of foot...the fabric bunches up there and pinches lines on my skin, which feels uncomfortable. I wore them for 1/2 an hour and couldnt stand it anymore. I'm just glad i was trying them on at home and didnt go to work in them. Im a construction worker and used to alot of discomfort, but not if i can help it. I returned these and will look for something more ergonomically fitting."
2.0,Super thin.  Small fit and I ordered up several sized. Ok for a lazy day at the house.
2.0,"The lights are cool when they work, I bought a different set and one of the 2 earnings didn't work. This set the purple one isn't working, there needs to be a better way to make sure these products work before being sent out."
2.0,"Comfortable, but discovered they run a little smaller than stated.  I returned the first pair which I ordered based on the size of my other shoes, but they were tight.  I ordered the next size up (with the low end being my normal shoe size) which I thought might be a little loose, but it fits okay -- a little snug, but not uncomfortable.  After wearing them for three days, inside our home only (carpet and wood floors), and the soles are already showing signs of wear.  That is disappointing.  I would order this brand again.  After less than four months, the upper part of the slipper started separating from the sole -- posing a tripping hazard.  The sole on the right slipper also has a crack in a groove near the front of the slipper."
2.0,"The boot deteriorates very easily, the photos reflect only one day of use, specifically 8 continuous hours.  The use I gave it was just walking in an environment without rubble;  warehouse environment.  I recommend it only for those who require nice shoes for casual wear, not for work.  It did not meet the expectation of being an indestructible shoe."
2.0,"Thr concept is nice but,  the execution is pretty bad. The seams aren't complete and there are loose threads everywhere.."
2.0,"Some don't work, many break after one or two uses. But they get the job done. My students love using them to track their reading!"
2.0,Terrible quality. Material looks and fells cheap. Had to send it back.
2.0,These would have been so much better if they didn't have the ring around back. So when you but them in they don't lay right.....if they weren't so cheap I would rip off the back to just make it a stud back.
2.0,"I have a 28 waist but these didn't even go over my hips. So I'm not sure what to say about their sizing. Maybe the zipper needs to go down farther? Or you need to go up a size, go by your hip size on the chart in the description (I didn't know what size I was getting, but I would have thought 28, so this is worth mentioning) rather than waist size. However, that means you'll have gapping in the waist.<br /><br />I like the stripes and they seem sturdy enough and stylish, but I could do without the frayed holes. I thought they were just frays, but they are actually holes. You can see skin through them."
2.0,"Didn‚Äôt hang flat on my dress, but the colors size were nice."
2.0,"This isn‚Äôt exactly what I ordered, what I thought I was getting was a flower with the qoute and what I ended up with was hearts and a qoute, it‚Äôs also really small so the letters are hard to read."
2.0,"I just received the sports bra today and I wanted to try it out. I used the sizing guide to determine which bra would fit best and I feel like the bra was bigger than I expected it to be. There was little to no support- (I am a 40DD)The design of the bra is nice, with the cross in the back. I was for sure the cross in the back would add extra support. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt call it a ‚Äúhigh impact bra‚Äù at all. Probably more like low impact. The material was great though. The bra is very comfortable though- I will just wear it as an indoor around the house bra. I would like to see maybe more supportive straps and a better fit for the bra. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again if given the opportunity but I might suggest it to someone who needs a low impact, comfortable sports bra."
2.0,The dress is nice. Its soft but the dress is on the larger size it was a bit longer than I was expecting. On the plus side the dress does have pockets! The color of the dress was a bit off I order a navy blue and the dress is almost black.
2.0,Gave it 2 stars because the color and fabric were nice. Not fitted as it appears in the photo.
2.0,Ouch....literally sooooo painful
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6118d7feee14ab8858c1dc290449e491]] DO NOT BUY I bought this for my sister because her other one like this broke it is just glued together and made very poorly so I don‚Äôt recommend
2.0,"I like the color.  I like the fit.  I hate the wrinkles.  I steamed it.  I ironed it, it looks like a rag within minutes of putting it on, as the fabric is cheap. It feels cheap and looks worse.  If they had used a better quality of fabric that held up to simple wear, I would be purchasing another."
2.0,Very uncomfortable. Also hard to put on. The magnet keeps sticking to the band and it‚Äôs hard to separate.
2.0,"I liked the way it looks; however, it is very uncomfortable to wear."
2.0,La calidad muy mala
2.0,Pretty and reasonably priced but beads were stuck tight and took a pair of pliers (covered with fabric for protection) to remove. Returned in resalable condition because gauge of wire is too large for the pearl cages I purchased to go with them. Received a snippy email from the seller with my refund. Will take my business elsewhere.
2.0,"These are cute, however the actual quality is so poor! The gemstones are loose in all three and look like they are going to fall out. Plus the actual quality and look of the gems is also a little poor. I was really looking forward to these and I am very disappointed. I may return them."
2.0,The fit is very large and I returned it.
2.0,The zipper was broken and quality was kinda cheap.
2.0,"You get what you pay for, very cheap gold material"
2.0,"Disappointed with these socks. They are too big for my almost 2 year old and the seams on the bottom are very uncomfortable. They are hidden in her shoes so for short time frames, she will keep them on her feet"
2.0,"I ordered a 2-pack of six/each.  6-white & 6-black.  I washed them before wearing, the black socks shrunk by 20%, they are now much smaller than the white sox."
2.0,Ordered on a Tuesday was supposed to be delivered Friday did not receive the item until Monday item was ill fitting did not have a low plunging neckline and has this weird kind poof  on the front where it should be lying flat
2.0,"Just got my wallet and while the craftsmanship look pretty good, the color is a LOT lighter than pictured.  This looks more like a Grayish Tan than the brown shown in the pictures.  Had the true color been shown, I wouldn't have bought it."
2.0,"There is no shape to this sweater like the image shows. It looks like its loose and flowy, but that is entirely wrong. It is a straight box and very unflattering."
2.0,the dyes from the fabrics stained my other clothes ;/
2.0,"The day I recieved the sweater, I tried it on.  I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh about 115.<br />This sweater was way to short. It didn't cover my belly.<br />Worse yet, it came with 2 holes, and not the shoulder holes that were supposed to be there. There were holes on each side.<br />I will be returning it.<br />I would not recommend this sweater."
2.0,Too heavy fabric. Not comfortable and small fit.
2.0,It is too small.
2.0,The medal around the draw strings started to rust and it stained the front of the shorts orange.
2.0,I loved this belt. It looks nice and works great right until a one of the little screws holding the buckle to the belt fell out. It's so small I could not find it and soon the belt was no good since the other little screw was not enough to hold it together. I thought it would last longer then 6 months.
2.0,"this dress is HUGE. it‚Äôs a decent length, perfect for church but i am not a fan of the bagginess and weirdly tight neck area. if u get this, definitely size down and i would not get this dress if you have bigger arms or chest area!"
2.0,No we gave the recommended dose and they ran all over the show ring.
2.0,"Hot Bottoms Women's True Comfort Cotton Bikini Briefs Panties from Tachtonim arrived safely and without incidence.<br />I hate to be the odd man (or woman as is the case here) out here but these panties fell far below my expectations. I am surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star ratings given the fact that many people also rated the fit as &#34;somewhat small&#34;.<br />Purchased these Hot Bottoms panties as an replacement for my usual brand, VS whose quality of a comparable style has diminished greatly as of late. It seems to be a trend because I had recently purchased some Fruit of the Loom panties which were also of lesser quality compared to what they used to be. Those I have however kept as they are soft and comfortable, these I will not as they are neither.<br />The fabric was not exceptionally soft, the cut was way off, and the elastic was cheap and taut (sorry, that sounded saucy, lol). With that said, these were definitely not for me. So the search continues for a good quality, value-priced panty assortment.<br /><br />PROS:<br />‚ñ∫12 pack assortment.<br />‚ñ∫Variety of colors and patterns.<br />CONS:<br />‚ñ∫Runs small.<br />‚ñ∫Not cut proportionately.<br />‚ñ∫Fabric average to low quality, not soft.<br />‚ñ∫Below par elastic.<br /><br />Recommend to a friend?

2.0,"Could be a very cute little dress, but has strange seems running through bust area making for poor fit.  Fabric not the best also.  Will donate."
2.0,Had to return.......Was EXTREMELY large.........Fit awfully..........Made me look like I was pregnant and I am VERY SKINNY.  Ended up returning
2.0,Fabric is not a soft sweatshirt it is a nylon sheen with a lining that is itchy.
2.0,Item arrived with make up or something other sort of stains.
2.0,"When I received these the eyes were not glued on and the earrings were much more flimsy than I expected.  One of the eyes was in the package, but it was not worth trying to glue them on.  Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,The metal rings to secure the drawstring holes had fallen off before I even unwrapped the package. Not very soft either. Returned.
2.0,"Not  very good fabric, very thin. Mine came with a stain on the sleeve as well."
2.0,The trim is more pink in person than I expected. When I took it out the pack it looked very much like a garment from the a.k.a. sorority
2.0,"Fits me perfectly on the waist down, but the top doesn‚Äôt fit at all. It doesn‚Äôt have the extra material that it shows in the image. I had my friend try it on thinking she is a little smaller in the bust area, and it still didn‚Äôt fit. Busy size for me 39.5‚Äù and 38‚Äù<br /><br />The material is really riff on the inside. It already feels like I have washed 50+ times."
2.0,Alright.  However the really cheap chains took away from a nice costume look.
2.0,"I am very unhappy with the shipping. The product came broken with 3 beads displaced. Also, one of the white rhinestones looks very dull and damaged."
2.0,My wife was not pleased with the fit
2.0,Beautiful shirt.  But sized wrong.  Ordered a large thinking I should have ordered a 1 or 2 X
2.0,The zippers keep getting stuck
2.0,"If you are on your feet a decent amount, these don't last long. I started getting wear-holes after just a month or so of wearing them!"
2.0,"These socks aren't soft enough. After a few hours the texture rubs on my toes, inside my shoes."
2.0,The earrings are too big and although I read it but didn't realize how it'd look - they r made of a ceramic like material. Just  not my thing. I clipped them on a curtain and it looks pretty still but not for earrings.
2.0,"The lenses are nearly impossible to fit back in when you change them out. The instructions that come with the sunglasses only show you how to remove the lenses. Nothing to show you how to put them back in...should be simple then, huh...reverse the process for taking them out. But no, you do that, fidget with them, bend them this way and that, and they still won't fit back in flush. There are gaps at the top of the lenses regardless of which lenses I put in there. I regret ever trying to put in the low light lenses. I can't reach their website so no customer service to look to see if there's a trick that I'm missing. My recommendation: never buy these if you intend to use the alternate lenses."
2.0,"With no back, they keep slipping off my feet.  About killed myself going downstairs when one of them came off as I was taking a step."
2.0,"Pay very close attention to the details! This watch has a 33mm (1.29"") face and a band to match. I can barely fasten the strap. Why Amazons returns a link to this watch in a search for ""Men's Watches"" is a mystery. This is a CHILD'S watch. The strap is about seven inches total."
2.0,"Doesn‚Äôt look anything like the photo, doesn‚Äôt fit on my head properly and won‚Äôt stay. Looks pretty cheap, not worth $35."
2.0,Dress is extremely thin. I returned it
2.0,They slip off sometimes.
2.0,I gifted this key chained to my bf and it sort of became like our symbol. The product seemed really durable but 7 months later the leather like strap on the key broke out of no where. We were both devastated because we really loved these. Its definitely a good buy but must be used delicately. For a keychain you rarely use.
2.0,It did not come with any tools to change the links for size.
2.0,Brazil spelling is incorrect in both English and Portuguese. It appears to possibly be the Spanish interpretation. Brazilians speak in Portuguese and their common spelling is Brasil with an ‚Äúa‚Äù instead of ‚Äúe‚Äù. English is Brazil still with an ‚Äúa‚Äù but substituting the ‚Äús‚Äù for a ‚Äúz‚Äù.
2.0,I purchased two of this style.  The sky blue set top armholes are too large and hang out under the arm.  The other set I have fits perfectly.  Can something be done about the sky blue set?
2.0,The color is much darker in person
2.0,"These are fine socks for boots, but after a couple of washing they sag down to nearly your ankle. They are quite warm in boots."
2.0,"I routinely wear two pairs of socks in the house in the winter, so I was hoping these Ristake Thick Insulted Boot Socks would keep my feet toasty warm.<br /><br />The socks feel thick on the foot. Kind of like walking on a cloud. But the socks are so thick that I can‚Äôt wear them with my normal work boots. I doubt most people could wear these socks with boots unless their boots are big.<br /><br />For as thick as the socks feel, they aren‚Äôt super warm. My toes were cold after a few hours in the house; I didn‚Äôt even test wearing them outside!<br /><br />The cuffs didn‚Äôt stay up, so I had to keep tugging the socks up.<br /><br />The socks are made from 91% acrylic, 8% polyester, and 1% spandex. The first time I washed them, several loose threads popped up, which has me concerned about the longevity of the socks."
2.0,"The socks have a lot of loose threads on the inside that get stuck on my toes.  Somehow I've never noticed this with other patterned socks, so these seem to be different.  Also, they're pretty tight to put on.  It takes effort to put on the socks, and it just shouldn't take that much work."
2.0,Nice belt fell apart within a few months
2.0,"The fabric is quite thin and feels cheap, much like the fleece fabric on cheap baby blankets, the jacket is unlined and generally not great quality. One plus is that it has pockets however it is absolutely not worth the $50 I paid or anywhere close to that.<br />I am 5‚Äô8.5 or so and my weight fluctuates 125 +/-, 5 lbs the jacket hits just above my kneecap and doesn‚Äôt fit in a flattering way on my body. I will be returning ASAP.<br />For the other reviewer stating that it‚Äôs itchy because it‚Äôs wool is incorrect. The tag clearly states 95% polyester 5% spandex."
2.0,"Las tiras son muchisimo mas delgadas de lo que parecen, la calidad es una calidad media, en tama√±o est√° bien. El color bien, el empaque no es muy bueno, vienen en una bolsa de pl√°stico y llegan algo dobladas"
2.0,Ends too gold
2.0,"I too, have a child with autism.  He handles noise well; but as his mom, I am always trying to help him be more comfortable whenever I can.  These squished his head, causing him to be more frustrated and still shoving his fingers in his ears to block everything out.  I am okay with that,  maybe he just won't do headphones. What did frustrate me... I bought these brand new AND they look used! The bag that keeps is supposed to come with them,  the one that keeps them clean and organized, is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN... seriously,  did we just get someone's used returned item as a new one?!!! So unbelievable,  disappointing,  and unprofessional.  I will be getting a refund and trying a different company.  These are so highly recommended.  Not by my standards."
2.0,The dress was cute but the fit was good small. I'm an XL in most things because I have pretty big boobs. Their xl was more like a medium and the material isn't stretchy in any way.
2.0,Used my luggage for the first time traveling and the wheel broke off the large piece. Was very disapointed.
2.0,"The earrings are beautiful.  Unfortunately, the posts are like little saws that cut into the ear hole."
2.0,This is super thin material! Also it stretches and doesnt ever form back.
2.0,"The pants fit like a perfect 4T, the top however fits like a very small 3T. It's a bummer because they are super soft and adorable!"
2.0,"The quality was much less than i expected, though shame on me for expecting more at the price it was. I wore these for about a week until multiple people told me they look cheap."
2.0,"I got the style two which was beautiful fabric, loved it! I was so excited that I found a style where everything tied so it was more adjustable.  The top fit perfectly......now for the but.......unfortunately for me and for the low rating, the coverage for the gluteus was showing too maxims, in other words didn't cover enough for my for my taste."
2.0,"Size chart is off some. It said I was a 3x (normally wear a large or xl) the 3x was so big in waist. Made weird. Not high quality, you get what you pay for. I really don‚Äôt like the seem down the front either, almost looks like something that should have been in back or sides def not the front."
2.0,Prefer the cloth ones they‚Äôre more comfortable I thought these would be the cloth covered ones but they‚Äôre not.  Little tight On wrist.
2.0,"I brought this watch because it is attractive and I‚Äôve heard of other ‚Äúquality‚Äù Seiko watches such as the SARB033 and the SKX009 however, if there is a Seiko heritage, then this watch doesn‚Äôt have it. It is extremely fast; one minute in a day and a half and this is unacceptable. I started wearing it for short terms such as going to an event but never for a full day. It is the worse watch investment that I‚Äôve made."
2.0,Quality. Materials are flimsy
2.0,loved the dress..color is beautiful but the arms are extremely small
2.0,It‚Äôs hard to open the clasp to get the mask on. Not for kids
2.0,Purchased for my wife. I used the sizing chart and these seem to be in kids sizes.
2.0,"Important - this item is mislabeled. Instead of a black shirt sleeve shirt, you will receive a white long sleeve shirt. I ordered it a second time and again received a white shirt<br /><br />It‚Äôs still a nice shirt, but you won‚Äôt get what you ordered"
2.0,"arrived early , nice but size was wrong. too small"
2.0,Not much lift and runs small.
2.0,Runs small. Very cheaply made. Returned it
2.0,Fabric was not sparkly
2.0,The tools provided do not fit the screws to replace the watch
2.0,The Instructions on the can are not in English. They look like they are in an eastern european language.
2.0,"The plastic nub holding the small loop to the strap broke after just a few weeks or so, and before long the whole thing snapped, thankfully not while I was in the middle of anything particularly swing-y. If you're a Beat Saber enthusiast (assuming from the color scheme here), I wouldn't recommend them, they don't hold up for long or under any strenuous use."
2.0,Of the three pairs of flannel lounging pants: one pair fit perfectly; the crotch depth in the second pair was shorter making it necessary to wear the pants below the waistline.  The third pair was entirely too small ... could not even get them on! All three had LG on their labels!  The third pair will go to my grandson.
2.0,"Very disappointed, fabric is very cheap looking"
2.0,"Be aware, they do not come with the &#34;4 Hole Cleat nut (M5)&#34;. You have to buy it separately."
2.0,This is a relatively lightweight blanket and does not merit the higher price compared with similar products.  The reason I chose this one is the Amazon description says it is appropriately 60 in. X 80 in.  It‚Äôs not even close to that.  It measures 52 in. X 72 in. like many of the other similar blankets sold on Amazon.  We need a larger size to cover the top of a queen size mattress.
2.0,"Originally given 4 stars because they fit, looked nice but were a little more transparent than Oakleys...3 months later and they look like absolute crap."
2.0,"These are going to work well with my costume for the upcoming pirate festival, and other like costumes. But the quality is too poor to wear everyday like I was hoping. They look like something I could have made myself with a hot glue gun and supplies from the local craft store."
2.0,Way too small if u want it to fit like the model order 2 sizes up....good quality though
2.0,"This sweater looks just like something I would wear and at a great price. When I opened it my husband asked if it was made for a tree. I was undeterred. It‚Äôs a sweater and obviously very stretchy. However‚Ä¶<br />There is no tag at the top and both sides are exactly the same, a deep V-neck (and back). This causes the shoulders to just want to slip off. This sweater runs EXTREMELY SMALL, so if you do buy it, size way up. I am 5‚Äô6 and 115lb and got an XS, which is often my size in sweaters. The only reason I gave this two instead of one star is because I should‚Äôve ordered a small (but really a medium at least) and that‚Äôs my bad. Although, I‚Äôm afraid if I went very big that the V would cut down too low (I guess you could always wear a cami underneath). Maybe a larger breasted woman could pull it off (and keep the shoulders up)? Definitely not me."
2.0,watch band just barely fits my wrist.  the adjustment of the features is not that easy.  watch looks good though.  this is just going to be a backup  in case my SEIKO has problems.  haven't figured out how to set the alarm or the day of the week.  you really can not eXpect much from a $19.00 watch.
2.0,"It was very pretty, but no size was indicated and it was quite small. Didn't cost much so I donated to charity."
2.0,"This coat has potential.  Unfortunately, the top was tight and the bottom was big.  Also, for my personal taste, I would have preferred the buttons to be the same color as the coat.  I would purchase from this seller again."
2.0,I like the look and fit but they distort my vision.I'll be returning them.
2.0,I wear a 10-12 and I bought an extra large which is a 14. To small. Cute overalls
2.0,The product is fine but my regret is not checking for size. I assumed it was a one size fits all.
2.0,To short &won't stay together
2.0,"These almost immediately started to come apart, fabric is OK, stitching is weak, will be constantly stitching them up again"
2.0,This like other slippers listed as waterproof for indoor/outdoor use is not true. I ordered 2 pairs of these under 2 different sellers and listings and listed as waterproof is false.  My socks have gotten wet while wearing both pairs. Don't waste your time!
2.0,These slippers have added to my foot pain rather than relieved it.
2.0,I did not like the fabric. It‚Äôs a jersey stretch knit not an athletic knit. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre comfy but not great for working out.
2.0,"They fit and look great, but after wearing once, a tear occurred along the belt line. I was able to exchange for a new pair.  Had the second pair for about a month (worn maybe 10 times)  and found another tear, again on the belt line.  It's too late to return the second pair.  I expect to get more than a month worth's of occasional wear or of my clothes."
2.0,While I love this dress and the fit is perfect it came covered in what appears to be coffee stains... That's why I'm giving it a low grade... Other than that it's a perfect dress
2.0,"This shoulder bag is more of a ""beach bag"" quality.  Has no shape whatsoever!  Totally not as pictured!"
2.0,"Product definitely fits small at the top. The arms and chest are snug. Unfortunately, I won't be able to wear it, which makes me sad b/c it's super comfortable other than that. And cute too!"
2.0,"Material is very cheap, fit is too big"
2.0,Bad choice!
2.0,"As expected, this needs &#34;hand was separately&#34; as the dyes bleed.  The pattern is a bizarre mix of quasi paisley designs, varying in shape from eye balls to, just above the hem, demented goat heads.  The cut is way to small in the chest and the elastic way to tight.  It is uncomfortable."
2.0,I bought several pieces of jewelry from this seller and I am very happy with all the other pieces. They were just beautiful.  I gave them 5 stars but to me this piece looks very cheap and I will not wear it. Some people might like it but it's just not my cup of tea. The funny thing is that it cost more than twice the price of the other sets and is well worth what you pay for it. But because of the quality of the other pieces ( the turquoise sets) this piece falls short.
2.0,Nice on outside. Inside lining is really cheap.
2.0,This dress was 2ft too long. Beautiful but I had to return it.
2.0,This top is pretty but it has so many bad points. First you better order a size smaller than you normally would. Second the elastic part scratches. It‚Äôs way too long. It‚Äôs really big too. I know I sorta said that but believe me it runs way big. I usually like tips big but this one doesn‚Äôt look right being so big. The cut is too low for it. Low in the bust area. I was a bit shocked as I usually love Lorace products. The last two I purchased though were disappointing.
2.0,"The cap visor (front) was sewn crooked,  Will never order again from this seller.<br />jgd"
2.0,Too big and can't breathe with it on very uncomfortable
2.0,This runs very small. My wife ordered an extra large and it feels like a size medium. It feels very cheap and flimsy. I would not recommend this.
2.0,The jacket too big still have it my grandbaby never wore it
2.0,"I‚Äôm a size L and I thought it would fit me, but it does not. If you‚Äôre looking for get this item, buy it one size large. So like I said I‚Äôm a L size so you would have to get an XL for this product. The size chart wasn‚Äôt helpful as I thought but I hope this review helps all you guys wanting to hug this item."
2.0,"Uneven, not symmetrical. Pulls apart too far. Extremely thin fabric. Not substantial. Move on."
2.0,"Size is as shown on pictures. Nice simple gift. There were some rejects, though. Given that I‚Äôm giving these as gifts, I‚Äôd like my keychains to be without cracks and scratches."
2.0,"Little small in size, hard to open and close"
2.0,Dress was so short it looked like a top. If it was longer I would have kept it. Nice dress.
2.0,"Should have been classified as Kidd‚Äôs size, small and not useable"
2.0,Very cute idea but very tight in my newborn yet very long on the top of her head at the same time. Looked like a sock was hanging off in the back.
2.0,It is not size16.
2.0,"The hat came with one of the buttons broken. But, kept me warm while shoveling snow."
2.0,I love the shirt but it‚Äôs a bit larger than I would have hoped.
2.0,I usually wear small. I ordered medium. Very tight.
2.0,Pretty pin but mine broke after only a few weeks!
2.0,I liked them at first but then after a month of use they started turning black & infected my ears.
2.0,doesn't glow. left in light for hours. its doesn't sit against skin right.  Its just ok. wish it glowed as advertised.
2.0,"Will be returning. Was too short for me (5'7"") so it did not fit right. Material is nice."
2.0,"The sleeves has a weird cut too them, it actually feels like I have a short sleeve underneath but just in the arms. Waffle pattern is definitely cute and color is spot on. Returning really don‚Äôt like that sleeve area enough to keep."
2.0,"I was excited for this band. I liked the thin band, and material. However, it wouldn‚Äôt line up/stay locked in the slots of the Apple Watch. I work in law enforcement so I need a band that I know is durable and won‚Äôt have my watch be flying off my wrist while on duty. If that part was fixed, I would love this band, but unfortunately I was disappointed."
2.0,Very cheap didn't last a whole month.
2.0,These are not polarized and do a poor job at blocking the sun.
2.0,Ordered a 9.5 US. Received a 9.5 UK (10.5 US / 44 EU)... they fit like a 8.5 US. I'm a walking mail carrier so I might get a month's use out of these. They are very light!
2.0,I wanted to like it since it was such a good price but unfortunately it felt cheap and was pretty sheer (even in black).  I wasn't expecting the Best quality given the price but I ultimately sent it back.
2.0,I thought it was leather. by looking from the picture it looks all fancy and stuff but its really cloth and you could buy it at your local Walmart.
2.0,It‚Äôs pretty thin. It will be fine for chilly days but not for truly cold days. I ordered the purple and it‚Äôs definitely not purple. More like a denim blue. The material on the outside of the coat is very soft. I like that. I like the silky lining inside the sleeves. The ‚Äúfur‚Äù on the hood is pretty matted down.
2.0,Not flattering and way too big
2.0,"Very cheap, coarse material.  My son lives for Lightning McQueen, but he refused to wear these."
2.0,"I'm so disappointed by this shirt. The quality of the shirt itself is very high, but the imprint is terrible. I don't know who did the heat pressing, but it was not done properly. They did not make sure it was complete before sending. I could tell from the day I received the shirt that the lettering would not stay and I was correct. It seemed like it would peel right off. It did not do that, but in the first wash, the letters already have a waviness around the edges. This imprint will not last long. I'm so sad, because I need this shirt when dealing with certain vendors."
2.0,Loved the idea and the shoes look great but the adjustment strap broke after the same day I went to use it for my son.
2.0,"I gave it two stars because It's a beautiful piece, but this isn't a bathing suit. The outside of it feels like it, but the inside and the big bow are made of cloth that does not dry easily, as a bathing suit it's supposed to. When my parents saw it, they actually thought it was a costume because of the material, and I came back to Amazon to check that I hadn't purchased a costume by mistake. Nope! It says bathing suit on the title... I'm returning."
2.0,Advertised as Adjustable strap (it's not) and because of this it makes it look like an achward neck line for me and I hate to send it back because of this and I got it in a pattern they now nolonger have. So I cant reorder it.
2.0,"These are pretty and fun for the kids, the neck part is very tight though. I ordered 3 and one was obviously already returned and was missing the mask but I didn't have time to return and reorder so that was disappointing."
2.0,Its ok but not the best quality
2.0,"My first one of these fell apart when sliding it onto the watch.  The replacement didnt fall apart, but the fit on the watch is inconsistent.  One side of the strap barely slid onto the watch.  The other side feels loose.<br />It the keeper piece doesnt snap together like the real apple band.<br /><br />The material is soft."
2.0,"The sleeves on this coat are too short, nothing like the model. Also takes forever to arrive, approximately 2 months from when I ordered."
2.0,"Nice color but were WAY too long. Not capri pants, went past my grandmas shoes."
2.0,Very disappointed. They are very lopsided and look rushed. They have nice weight to them and the chain is a good length. But I just can't get past the shape. They don't even sit flat.
2.0,First of all it‚Äôs not black it‚Äôs blue and I order it Black the blouse is way too big
2.0,"I wear a size 2 or 4 in pants/shorts, so I ordered these in a small.  They were too small, however."
2.0,"tight in arms but loose in bust, especially for a small and wrap style.<br />my dress did not have any inner loop or hole to thread the first wrap string though as most wrap dresses do"
2.0,The Nike logo is shown as embroider in the picture but it came glued in plastic
2.0,"Super comfy material, not see through. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 160lbs and got a medium. The knot part was way too short and showed my stomach. Maybe this would work for someone with a short torso but not long enough for me."
2.0,"Stretchy cotton like material. The zipper on the side helped to get it on, but it's difficult to move around in. The cap sleeves are odd, there is no armpit area so it is always open and exposed."
2.0,This junk was to small and I went a size up but it did look like the picture
2.0,"Nice quality, but not true to size!"
2.0,"to thin you feel all the wind, pockets can't hold anything they will just fall out"
2.0,"Too masculine looking, bulky;. 'The instructions are not clear. 'the alarm goes off every morning at 2 a.m. and there are no reset or turn off instructions oincluded. I have email timechand regarding this issue and asked for help but have yet to hear from them."
2.0,Awkward fit. Never ended wearing.
2.0,The quality of fabric was great and it fit chest good but the problem I had was the neck part was way to long so if I pulled top down it did not fit well at all. Sadly had to return
2.0,"Didn't look like the picture. The pink roses are this hyper pink shade, clearly a knockoff. Disappointed."
2.0,"Dress was cute but had to return. Not for busty ladies. Tried it on without a bra, made the girls look droopy. Tried it on with a bra and realized there wasn't enough material to cover the girls. I wear a DDDD, so if your chest isn't quite as large (DD or smaller?) you may give it a go. The material is light and the stomach opening is at a flattering level, even for ladies living large."
2.0,"Purchased this for my grandson..He loves it.. I gotta say it looks like it's made by 5 yr. olds though. It's very poorly made,and it looks pink,not red. My grandson is 6,he loves the Spy Ninjas so he's thrilled. I guess that's what's important.  I didn't know it was a knock off."
2.0,everything was good for the most part but you could tell it was very cheap. my bracelet broke and i‚Äôm very upset about it
2.0,I ordered a similar running shirt that ran too large so I ordered this in my size. It‚Äôs tight- I recommend sizing up.
2.0,"Wife displeased with it saying it tarnished pretty quickly (less than a few months, barely worn)"
2.0,"Thought this was going be be a bit more leather-like (not real leather of course) and a lot less plastic like. Very plastic like feel. One vary large opening in the purse, no dividers or such. Have gotten cheap purses in the past that were better."
2.0,ordered from men's shop to insure fit and everything I got from here is too small for my husband and he only wears a size 9.5.  Does not have big feet at all.
2.0,"I got this dress in red polka dot. I'm a 32 DD, 5'6 and 130 pounds, I ordered a medium but small would have been fine. This dress is flowy and comfy but... the shade of red and the size of the polka dots makes me think of Minnie Mouse!! Don't be disappointed like I am - get a different color!"
2.0,Size was way off! Much too big‚Äîhad to return.
2.0,The middle doesn‚Äôt have white fabric like the picture shows. it is kinda see through also.
2.0,It was to small on me. The material was vary rough feeling  and  it had a bad smell to it.
2.0,If you are looking for XXX bikini top to fit a larger bust look elsewhere. Definitely not worth buying if you are looking for a large cup size.
2.0,Beautiful style but the size ran big and it‚Äôs a lot longer than I expected.
2.0,"I ordered this product in a size small. I weight 130 pounds, and it turned out to be seemingly the size of an extra large. And it is a very short shirt, the design on the front is not as it appears in the featured photo. The fit is nothing like that of the photo. I would not order this product again...returning it today!"
2.0,"I was so excited to get this suit, which is so cute and flattering... if it'll stay on.  It has a fatal design flaw.  Instead of synching widthwise around the strap, which holds ""the girls"" in place, the string is woven up and down like a shoelace, along the whole back of the suit.  So, if the suit is not feeling very supportive, tightening the straps will not help secure it where you need it.  No, I don't like walking down the beach with my kids, and having the front slide up constantly.  I won't share a photo of that, but hopefully you can easily imagine, as if a sports bra had no elastic on the bottom.  Horrible design!  I love the fabric though, so I'm trying to figure out a way to sew in a supportive elastic band myself.  I wear a size 34C in bras, so not huge, but I honestly feel it would slide up for any size, considering the lack of a proper support band."
2.0,the 'non-slip' cord comes off the end of the glasses readily.  No matter where on the glasses I put them they come off when I take the glasses off.  Not worth buying.
2.0,"I LIKE THE SHIRT VERY MUCH BUT IT DOES NOT FIT RIGHT. I ALWAYS WEAR THE SAME SIZE IN KS SHIRTS. BUT THIS ONE COULD HAVE GONE DOWN ONE SIZE. BUT I'M NOT SENDING IT BACK FOR $11.00, IT WOULD COST ME OVER HALF OF THAT TO SEND IT BACK."
2.0,This didn't fit my daughter who is a a US size XL (too small). The fabric is stiff and a little thin so she did not find it comfortable. For the price you could find something that‚Äôs higher quality.
2.0,There are no instructions.  How do I make it heat up? How long does it have to charge - and how long will it hold the charge??
2.0,These were smaller than we thought and not made very well. At least they were just for Halloween so they held up for that one night but other than that I'm not sure they would have worked.
2.0,"I had bought this at a regular store and wanted a second pair.  I thought great, exact same size, style, darkness but cheaper so I ordered them.  They were what I ordered but the spring that brings them to fit snug on the glasses was loose and therefore did not hold snug to my glasses.  I should have returned them immediately but as I had a lot going on at the time didn't.  So from now on I will buy them in a store where I can be certain the fit is snug and right."
2.0,"Oof. I ordered the turquoise in a small (usually wear a medium, 5'7 135lbs, bit of a pear) after reading reviews. I decided to return (not exchange) for a few reasons.<br />- The color was more of a dusty sapphire blue... Pretty, but not turquoise.<br />- Fabric was very stiff. It felt more like a 60's costume with the solid bust and slip sewn into the skirt.<br />- The skirt was flared and a bit ""puffed"" like a petticoat, which would be cute for an Alice in Wonderland costume, but wasn't what I was looking for.<br />- The sizing was off because it fit like a medium/large everywhere but the bust which felt more like extra small.<br />-  And, possibly worst of all, the elastic in the waistband pinches, pokes, and made me itchy :("
2.0,The ring in the photograph is nothing like the ring received. Very disappointed and contacted the seller
2.0,Received my package super fast it was not what I expected the material seem diferent and it's pretty faded but I put it to use and it works fine on my mouse.
2.0,"I bought these for our infant son so he would be protected in loud places.  However, they are very tight and he cries every time I put them on."
2.0,This suit isn't for me.  While I like the style it's the fit that I have an issue with.  I don't have a long torso and this felt like it was pulling from the bottom to the top.  The other issue is that the black side of this suit is only tacked at the bottom right side.  you then the it on the other side but If it comes untied your right side would be exposed.<br />I can't say I would wear this suit.
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt gives any sweat even after a hard workout
2.0,Didn't like how tight it was soft fabric was the only good plus too it
2.0,The insert heel is falling apart after only a few wears. I bought a similar pair last year and didn‚Äôt have a problem.
2.0,Super cute but very flimsy plastic and crooked. Broke fast with gentle use!
2.0,The waist band is not the thicker band as pictured. I hope they send me the correct pants
2.0,"I wanted to love this, for a simple everyday wear. But is shrunk after just a few washes."
2.0,"The Dress feels like good material, although the design on the fabric doesn't look as good as it does in the picture. I ordered a size small and its looks like a mini dress, I should have ordered a medium. I would recommend going up a size."
2.0,I've ordered 5X for 2X that I am wearing. It is still too snug.
2.0,"They are not as finely made as the picture suggests, and I got a brownish color eye instead of the green I expected."
2.0,"Great shirt,  extremely small.  I ordered the size 8 and it was about the size of a 5t shirt.  The tag says 7-8yrs. I gave it to my 5 year old instead of the 7 year old I bought it for.  Nervous to try another size but it was a birthday present so he is kind of expecting it"
2.0,"Not embroidered, just stuck on lettering"
2.0,"Huge cheap belt strings, just a huge blob of cheap material"
2.0,If you get warm at night a sweat the ink in the strap comes off on the pillow.
2.0,"It is what I expected and yet also not what i expected. It is a thinner Sweatshirt, made from a nylon shiny type material, probably polyester.  It is unlined, I was expecting it to have a fuzzier inside like an actual sweatshirt but it is slick to feel outside and inside.  It's pretty. It's a little snug in the hips but it still hangs lower so I can wear it with leggings.  I do like it but it is not something made for cold weather. The wind just cuts right through it.  My boyfriend did not like the print job (I like it though), he said he wished it was more clear and it made him feel like he needed to get glasses."
2.0,Fabric good but belt slider has no teeth so belt goes back to its max. size once you sit down
2.0,"I love the length and everything, except the arms are too small they don't fit right"
2.0,The material is bad and the cut bells out and looks horrible. I returned it
2.0,"Im 5'6 145.  I ordered a size 8/10 but received a dress marked ""M"" and it was HUGE-- Definitely closer to a size 12 or 14!! The colors are absolutely beautiful but the dress itself is way to big and the length/flare is not as pictured!! Returning."
2.0,"This is basically a loose fitting bikini top, if you are comfortable with &#34;natural&#34; (aka no support) this will work. I recommend spending the extra money and buying Arie from AE or bralette from VS."
2.0,just OK. Kind of cheap looking and doesnt stretch much to fit an adult sized wrist. Wouldn't recommend or purchase again.
2.0,"These slippers are too wide and too short. I am size 8, ordered size 8 and it‚Äôs short.  Also they are so wide, that feet fall out. You will be tripping.  I don‚Äôt recommend it."
2.0,The sizes are small er than they should be.
2.0,"Look nice...nice they come with a button (which actually is not that securely sewed...) instead of velcrl... but they are not made for a weather below 0... you can easily feel your fingers getting very cold! Also.. they are a small size... even though I have small hands, these feel tight!"
2.0,The band is no good without the pins and brackets to attach the band to the watch.  I would think this vendor would know that.  Please send the four pieces needed to complete the replacement.  Two pins and two attachment brackets.  I spent all day in Las Vegas going to watch and jewelry stores to get these with no luck.
2.0,"The hat looks much better on the model than on me. She much not have any hair because this hat shows every bump(braid, loc, etc). Will only wear to bed."
2.0,Son wanted it and he was disappointed at how cheap it was.
2.0,The printing on the shirt is of poor quality.  There was an ink stain on the shirt too.
2.0,Both of them broke within a week of receiving. One completely fell out and went missing within 3 days and the other broke within a day of wearing it. Very disappointed.
2.0,Ok .. the shape is flattering but the fabric is cheap feeling and rough .. longer then I thought it'd be. Not a fan of this dress
2.0,"NATO straps just don't do it for me I guess. I just don't get their popularity at all. If you're into them, this one might work for you. It just didn't for me."
2.0,the lens were not expected
2.0,These earrings are very pretty.  The color is just what I wanted pastel stones.  The problem for me is the fastening.  It requires pressing down on the wire that goes through the ear just a bit and then pushing the parts toward one another to click back together.  I have arthritis in my hands and this is very difficult for me.  Having the little V that the wire clicks into is much easier for me.  Nice earrings but I will not buy any that appear to have this type of clasp.
2.0,"Bought this purse mid Sept (2018) as an everyday purse. Well today Oct 24, 2018 the stitching that connects the shoulder strap to the purse broke. I will be calling the manufacturer to complain. SO UPSET AS I LOVED THE PURSE!!! PICTURES ATTACHED"
2.0,Rins small
2.0,This looked great for 5 minutes until the elastic broke which made the wings useless
2.0,its so cute but went a little to low for me.
2.0,The product does not stay attached to any of my glasses.
2.0,Disappointed.  The zipper came apart and fell off within the first month of wearing it.
2.0,"As I stated in the comments, this item is sold as a ""sweatshirt"" when in fact it is a hooded T-shirt. Not at all what I wanted."
2.0,I was disappointed that the color was more teal than blue. And the material is not so great.
2.0,Not a matte patent-leather and flimsy at best. Has a pearlescent sheen and faux gold heart pulls. Not what was expected but probably on par for the price.
2.0,Skulls are not easily visible in person but the price is good
2.0,"They had a weird fit to them.  I wasn't happy with the cut, or the fabric"
2.0,"I tried 3 sizes of this particular shirt. Normally I'm a 15.5&#34; 32/33 ish but I was swimming in these shirts. I'm 5' 10&#34; 150 lbs and I could have fit another half person in these shirts.<br />When I laid this shirt on top of one of my Van Heusen regular fit shirts of the exact same size, the Alberto Danelli was about 2&#34; wider.<br />The material is fine; however, these shirts are built for men far larger than I am."
2.0,It's short.
2.0,"The installation was difficult because the band was really wide, Band was too stiff even after bending, and the buckle seems really cheap and sounds broken."
2.0,"I ordered a medium as was recommended, to small, I ordered a large, top was too big, bottom still snug. It would look great on someone who has 0 body fat or not had 4 kids. I loved the material and the look of the dress but the skin tight fit was a no go for me."
2.0,Took forever to arrive and cheaply made
2.0,Very see through and sheer
2.0,"I bought it for my daughter, but one had a ripped cuff."
2.0,Unfortunately it was too small. Buy a size bigger then you wear. Otherwise beautiful.
2.0,The product is correct but the price is ridiculous for only 1 badge
2.0,"I got these for my 5 year old during quarantine. It didn't quite fit on her face so my husband has been using them instead. They have a very annoying, itchy tag that he removed. Removing it made a hole."
2.0,Not real full grain leather as the description would have you believe. It's just a cheap belt that wears out in a month. Your better off going with a &#34;real&#34; belt that will last years.
2.0,It broke when I tried putting it on. Must of been made for a child.
2.0,Not a good quality. I wash it for first time and the string that gose around your neck the some of thread came off.
2.0,"Loved the way this band looked when it arrived.  Seemed rugged, too. Within five months, both bands that hold the excess strap in place fell off.  Six months, almost to the day, (today) the leather at the buckle attachment points both gave way and now the band no longer functions.  Not what I was expecting from a watchband made for an adventure style watch. The only saving grace is that I was sitting at breakfast when it happened and not active in the woods, so I didn't loose my $700 Fenix.  Don't waste your money or perhaps loose your watch by selecting this band!"
2.0,"I don‚Äôt like this shirt. Not nice the fabric, like a synthetic. Returned."
2.0,Pretty low quality. The fabric is fine but the electronic components are an exposes copper wire in a pouch. Pulled that out so they're just gloves.
2.0,"Yes, is a classic, yes obama and osame had one, but is not worth it, unless you are getting it for a kid!"
2.0,"Definitely NOT genuine leather as described.  It looks nice at first, but after a few wearings the top layer of plastic wears off to reveal a woven fabric inner core."
2.0,They go past the knees by quite a bit
2.0,"My wife loved the look of the sunglasses but they were made way too big. The glasses just fall off of her face, perhaps her nose is too little. These may better for someone with a larger face. Aviators are a tough fit for a lot of people."
2.0,Not very appealing
2.0,"I LOVED these leggings when I first got them. They feel like butter and are SO comfortable! However, they quickly began to pill and then they got TWO holes right in the most inconvenient area. So so disappointed :("
2.0,I think they are very cute but I would not recommend to purchase because the shell part is very thin and fragile. They broke before I was even able to wear them. Really crumbled to pieces and I had not touched them roughly.  As just triangles they are still fashionable so I will wear them but not the product I was hoping for.
2.0,"The tag was cut out of the shirt, can not see size or washing directions.  Shirt is ok but did not like the fact that it had been cut on!  Little on the short size!"
2.0,I did not receive the items listed in the description. There were four additional shapes that I do not like at all.  The shapes I did order were nice and am sorry I have to return them.
2.0,"Wayyyy to short! Like, laughable short! I‚Äôm 5ft6 and 190 36D. This barely covered my (although it be large butt) butt!"
2.0,The bra is good it‚Äôs just that the cup sizes was just a bit to small for me but may vary for others
2.0,These pants are not true to size. They shrank in length when washed.
2.0,"The earrings were pretty, but they are a pretty blue glass, that is fine, but they advertised that these were lapiz.. the price was great, the stone was wrong, although they are pretty colbolt glass!"
2.0,"Large White tanks too small and see-through. Tight round the ribs. Length ended at the top edge of my workout leggings. I'm a 36-38C long torso and normally wear a large. Since I washed them before wearing, had to give them away. Even if I had ordered up a size they'd still be too short."
2.0,This is Def not flannel or t-shirt Material more like pj's. This for me just not the dress I was looking for.  I ordered 3xl being in 5'11 and built broad with a bit of thickness.  It was baggy came to my shins. Even tying under the bust didn't make it flattering. But at least I wasn't popping out up top. It'll make for a great church dress or something.
2.0,"1-lovely picture but poor quality.<br />2-no suprise, weird sizing and be careful,these Chines made cycling jerseys always have no idea of right size.<br />3-ventilation is so terrible that it can only be used for spring not summer."
2.0,"Cute shirt but had a very strong, toxic smelling odor"
2.0,The material isn't that comfortable and it's too thin. Kinda transparent. Doesn't look great as well.
2.0,I started off loving the product.  After wearing it just one or two times it shrunk like crazy and I air dried it ? Just  falling  apart every time I wash it. I bought one in the store previously and I love it not made from the same material at all
2.0,Only had for a week and missing two stones already. Good clasp. Stays on well.
2.0,Cute shirt but size is very misleading. Order 2 sizes up if ya want it 2 fit...
2.0,"Says 3 pieces, only came with one. Difficult to use without help"
2.0,"Don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôre getting their shirts from but it looks like an elephant stuck his head through the whole when a human would put his head or her head. The graphics are phenomenal but the quality of shirts are piss poor. I have bought a number of shirts from spiral and every time I get anxiety worrying what the hell am I going to get. I have bought six shirts two  should‚Äôve sent back, one I did send back and this last one was the final straw. I recommend don‚Äôt buy from spiral unless you‚Äôre ready to send back items"
2.0,It‚Äôs super lightweight so that‚Äôs good. In person it does not look high end. I have small wrist so I hooked it onto the very last circle. It fit but it could‚Äôve flown out my wrist if it was to for my thumb bone area whatever it‚Äôs called. It felt as if it could easily be broken. It catches onto some clothing which I didn‚Äôt like because i pulled the brides dress and left a string hanging out. Whoops haha.
2.0,If you are full figured this dress will hit you at  incorrect places. The darts at the bust line are placed too high and do not cradle the girls. It is some what longer than tea length. I am 5'5&#34; at 176 lbs with an hourglass figure. Fabric was the standard thin spandex/polyester knit that was to light for the style
2.0,its pretty but its VERY small. Im a size 5 and it was too small for my middle and ring finger. the ring's designs are small too and it doesn't look as big as the picture shows. haven't worn it and not worth the money.
2.0,They were so cute until they were washed. One wash removed most of the green shine. Now they're just black with a little green sheen.
2.0,"The earnings are beautiful however way too heavy for my ears. They don't lay flat against the ear lobe due to the weight, it kind of drops down a bit. Its unfortunate since they are pretty."
2.0,Returned this product.  The front was very short and it was verylow.
2.0,Was supposed to be a sweatshirt but was long sleeve T
2.0,I ordered these shorts for my fifteen-year-old son. This is from the men's section yet they seem like they should be on the little boys section. They did not fit or come anywhere near his knees and in the middle part it is not roomy at all.
2.0,"After about a year of steady use it doesn't hold it shape and keeps leaning over. There is a long metal spiral that is seen into the outer seam that helps it hold its shape and it has work through the bottom of the bag. You can't re-insert it so the only options are cut it with wire cutters or continuously stab everything the bag comes in contact with. The design of the bag with it's separated areas is good, it's just not durable. I only use it to carry clothes/toiletries 3 days a week to work so I definitely don't abuse it. For this much money I'll switch back to a regular backpack that's durable or just keep buying cheap ones and tossing them out as they wear out."
2.0,Don‚Äôt know
2.0,"the quality is really poor, and the hems are coming apart after one use. i do not recommend.<br /><br />it was too big, i should have ordered extra small"
2.0,The size that the socks were to fit in inches on the calf were no where close to fitting.
2.0,Beware! Vest does not come with a battery. Battery is sold separately. Directions are in Chin-glish and totally confusing.  Don‚Äôt know if it works yet‚Ä¶ Still waiting to receive the battery that we had to order separately!
2.0,This dress was totally different then the way it looked online. The material is thick and the dress was really loose from the waist up. It's still a beautiful dress just not what I expected from the picture.
2.0,The sizing problem is pretty bas.
2.0,Bought a small for my daughter who's a size 6 in regular clothes outfit barely closes.
2.0,Ok at first...after a wash they are too small and I cannot wear. Can I still return these?
2.0,"The hose portion is extremely durable, I loved that.  Fit great on length, didn‚Äôt like the way it fit in crotch and rear.  Had to change mid-day.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 , 140 lbs"
2.0,"I dislike The way the dress was made, the Breast area was too high.And one side of the dress was longer than the other, I did like the design"
2.0,"Sleeves are too short, rethink this product. It's so cheap. It will not last in the wash"
2.0,Size 8 was too large; very large. I am 140lbs 36bust.
2.0,"these are cheap sunglasses, the only good thing about these is the fact is has the Florida gator logo on it"
2.0,Ran too small for the size bought.
2.0,Such tiny toes.. the only thing that made any of it worth it was the fact the company sent me a whole set of normal socks for free.
2.0,Definitely listen to the other reviews for sizing.  This dress is also very heavy looks darn silly if you're not twirling -- there is too much fabric.  I returned mine.
2.0,"These gloves ran small and the seams ripped almost instantly.  I would have complained, but I do not want a replacement."
2.0,First pair arrived with a hole in the outer thigh seam. I returned immediately. Second pair arrived perfectly fine . So far no issues after many use . Good board shorts .
2.0,They keep falling off.
2.0,Runs small. Think Juniors size. Otherwise nice top.
2.0,The quality is too low
2.0,They were comfortable when I got them but in less than a month both had holes in the bottoms.  I would definitely not buy again and I do not recommend them to anyone who would wear them while doing any amount of walking.
2.0,I purchased this less than a month ago and the bottom of the zipper is coming loose from the garment.  I have only worn it twice.  It‚Äôs ten days past the return date so I am stuck with it.  Would not recommend it.
2.0,I ordered this silk scarf in creme.  The picture looks very much like an off white but when I received it it looks more like a golden yellow.  Unfortunately I don't look good in that color.  Not worth returning it for the price.  I will give it as a gift.  Otherwise the size and quality seem good.
2.0,"Ugh came in wrong color. I think I ordered the wrong size, but it came in black and not white üôÑ"
2.0,"The frame is matte, which is not mentioned in the description. The mirrorring is just so-so ( nothing like the originals). Overall it has a cheap look."
2.0,"It‚Äôs great quality but not distressed like the picture shows, if your wanting an oversized fit then size up!"
2.0,"This is a really cute outfit, but the orange on the accessories pieces (all the bows) doesn‚Äôt match the ‚Äúorange‚Äù on the top! On the top, the pumpkin almost looks red! üòî Disappointing!"
2.0,"These are hilarious. But one of them broke after only one use. They're so cheap that I didn't worry too much about it. Plus, I only needs them for one even. But still wish they were a little better quality."
2.0,very uncomfortable and not effective.
2.0,"I returned this necklace, it looks cheap."
2.0,shirt was typical 2t fit  the shorts were humungous .  the tag says 2t but its just not possible..  now we have another miscellaneous shirt for blue jeans.  so disappointed
2.0,"The feathers where attached backwards and it was a pain to fix, I had to go buy jump hooks and fix them"
2.0,I really liked the way the bottoms looked but the top not so much ! I have a small chest so too just didn‚Äôt look right. It also left a really weird tan line in the middle of my chest. I‚Äôm sure it would look great if I had a fuller chest so the girls can be close together but it just didn‚Äôt work for me. With that being said I threw away the top and I pair the bottoms with a solid color top.
2.0,Looks very plastic-y.  Nice design but couldn't get past the material.
2.0,This shirt was way too big
2.0,Not a good quality. Didn't even match the design on the site.
2.0,Smaller than the picture.
2.0,It's very nice for the price.  However it breaks quickly if you wear it daily. Taking it on and off
2.0,Not bad for the price but the color on the bottom of the band started to rub off within the first week. Still looks very good but it won't last long. Still not bad for the price.
2.0,"I received the bag in one day on Prime and the zipper was sewn in twisted! I was not able to zip it closed. The bag itself was nice and soft and roomy.<br />But I requested a replacement due to the zipper.<br />It took 3 days, not 1 day Prime.<br />The replacement bag was even worse! The strap was extremely short, stiffer material, and the smell was HORRIBLE, like rotten fish!! I sent it back!<br />I still had the first bag, which I liked, so my friend manages to pry the end of the zipper off, take it apart, untwist, and was able to sew it back in. Such a hassle!"
2.0,"Soft, nice size, somewhat giftable, however the pattern is extremely blurry, not at all like the one pictured. You can only tell it‚Äôs a map from a distance away."
2.0,I bought these for my niece and she loved them but a couple of hours after wearing them they looked awful. It‚Äôs as if she‚Äôd rubbed the top on pavement. Don‚Äôt expect to use this more than once.
2.0,way to big would it a monster but not me and iam pretty big but my head is not
2.0,The one broke
2.0,Disappointed to say that the shirt I received was nothing like the shirt in the photo. The color isn‚Äôt even close I ordered a darker neutral and got a light cream. The fit is like tight unlike the looseness / relaxed fit of the photo. It‚Äôs also see through.<br /><br />Just all over not what I was expected.
2.0,Beautiful watch. It looks great with whatever I wear. I love it but stopped working after three months. I remember when watches lasted years now it‚Äôs a few months!
2.0,"One star for shipping, another for looking like what was described.<br /><br />I received the package in the morning, and after putting it on the pair for half a day, I needed to take them off because they started hurting (I have sensitive ears so I can only wear surgical/stainless steel, which these are described to be). I took them off as I normally would, and the smaller butterfly just fell apart from the larger stud in my hands. They don't seem to be attached together quite well‚Äîprobably just a dab of glue which makes me hesitant about wearing them even if I do get them fixed."
2.0,pretty good fit...not a bad choice...wore it to a wedding was pretty nice...colour was exactly what i ordered
2.0,"Got this for a Mother's Day gift and it's huge, won't even fit my wrist falls straight off and you can not make it smaller!!!! The return date has closed so I can't exchange it or return it for something else, cute bracelets but complete waste of money because it can't even be worn üòû"
2.0,Bracelet too big.  Disappointed in the bracelet doesn't adjust to my wrist.
2.0,"I am 5'6"" 135-140lb not as active as I would like. Dont judge. I usually wear a Medium bralette.<br />The zipper is crazy hard to get up. If you pre-zip it and then attempt to put your arms in and pull it up- HOLD TIGHT to the top of the zipper or it will unzip...<br />I like the full front coverage and the material used BUT it is way too tricky get clasped. I would not buy it again."
2.0,"This dress is heavy and feels like good quality. However, it‚Äôs not flattering and does not look like the same dress as the pictures. I wear a size 2/4, small. I ordered the size 4 and couldn‚Äôt zip the back all the way. I wear 34D bra size and that seems to be too big for this size dress. Also the chest doesn‚Äôt align well with the cut of the dress. It‚Äôs very ill fitting. I‚Äôm not at all impressed with the look of it. I ordered it to tame professional pics with it, but that‚Äôs not going to happen. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù for reference on length. I think the length is fine with high heels. But even if it fit, I would not wear this dress. It‚Äôs matronly in my opinion. If you have smaller chest and like a conservative look, this might work for you. I prefer a little more sex appeal. This is not it. üëéüèº"
2.0,"The show itself is okay. Cheap but you get what you pay for and I was looking for something in mint green. I read that the shoe was a little on the small side so I ordered a half size up. I am shoe size 8.5 so I ordered a size 9 and as soon as I took them out of the box I thought there had been some kind of mistake because I could see at first glance that they would be too small. I checked the shoe and indeed, it was a size 9. I can barely get them on my feet and so they are actually on wearable. So make sure you order a full size up, not a half size. Other than that, the color is true and they would be fun, cheapo shoes if I could get them to fit."
2.0,"I really liked it and enjoyed wearing it but as soon as I washed it (in cold water) the colors ran. Shame, I got compliments on it, but returning it now."
2.0,"Poorly shaped hat.  My husband has forbidden me to wear it.  However, it is inexpensive."
2.0,Size is way small.  Not even close.
2.0,"Socks look good, however there is an issue I found as the very top edge of the sock isn't stretchy elastic and doesn't move. If you have calves that expand due to swelling during the day, your socks turn into tourniquets and become downright painful. Copperfit makes a sock with an elastic top that will expand. These socks look good and that's where the benefits stop for me."
2.0,This top came undone every chance ot got just a waste of time and money fr.
2.0,"They were  pretty  but way too big for my taste ,I gave them to my daughter. Put the diameter in inches or fractions thereof."
2.0,The uniform sent is BLACK not a Classic Navy Blue Sailor Suit Long Sleeve as stated and shown in picture. Very disappointed!
2.0,Only 3 of the rings were actually correct. The other 5 was not the right rings and one was not advertised on their site at all. It‚Äôs like someone just threw random rings together. Kinda bummed. Hopefully the reorder will be correct:/
2.0,It's very blurry. Impossible to read if you don't already know what it says.
2.0,"Mens 11 was the same as womens 11. I bought for my son, they fit me. Arghh"
2.0,Wanted to love this bag. Well made and fairly roomy. But those side pockets can‚Äôt fit a bottle or sippy cup once the inside of the bag is full. I am so sad and disappointed. Can‚Äôt use the bag without those pockets. Will be returning.
2.0,i do not have a box
2.0,"Cute, but material is VERY see-through and itchy."
2.0,Crown not big enough
2.0,"When taking this product off it tore my skin leaving and open wound! It works, but comes at a price"
2.0,Too small cant use it
2.0,The material was very cheap and it was see thorough. It might be a good swimsuit cover up but not for normal day wear.
2.0,"These boots might look cute from far away or in pictures; however, in reality they look and are very cheaply made.  First of all the strings feel like they could just fall apart, and the material is so thin.  On the pair I received some of the studs were bent in like they had been worn already.  I ordered a size 10 which is my normal size and they were way too small.  In my opinion don't even bother ordering these boots.  They are not good quality whatsoever.  I also ordered the brown pair and it was a lot more brown than the picture let on.  I thought it would be a little darker than it was.  Very disappointed in these.  They were returned."
2.0,"Always been a boxer brief guy. Thought I‚Äôd try these. The legs are cut very short, So they ride up the crotch and bunch up. It‚Äôs just cut differently than what I‚Äôm used to."
2.0,I purchased 4 Burts bees  footie at a competitor store.They fit my baby well and the organic cotton cloth is very soft and I love it ! (I purchased the 6-9 month size)<br />This has a stretch fit and the cuffs have elastic and it fit is more of a slim cut but it fit my baby well.<br />Fast forward a couple of washes and I followed the washing instruction to the T all the burst bees sleepwear has lost its elasticity and it just lost its shape.<br />The fitting is very loose now so much so that I don't feel safe with my baby wearing this at night since the cuffs come up and the outfit just bunches up under the chin.I'm so unhappy with this because I absolutely loved the prints .They are unique and I was getting sick of seeing my baby in carters stripes!<br />I would not buy this again simply for the fact that $12.95..PS I paid $16.95 somewhere else ..at that price times 4 outfits I have close to $70.00 worth of rags !Not cool Burt's bees ..Not cool!<br />P.S. I bought childrens place outfits that are similar stretch material and they have lasted through the washes much better!
2.0,"Ripped the first time I put them on. Nylons have come a long way in run prevention, I expected more from this. I do enjoy the open toe and thigh high aspects, but as I said: got a run the first time wearing them, and I‚Äôm not a large person, and did very little while wearing them."
2.0,The front of the dress folded so that it kept a tent in the center below the buttons. No matter what she did it just kept sticking out straight.  It looked silly.<br />The fit was tight for the size.  The fabric thin.<br />She was not a fan and based on the tenting would not recommend this dress to anyone.
2.0,The straps are very very long. It‚Äôs baggier then expected.
2.0,Its hard to put winning money inside.
2.0,"Definitely a solid watch case, and well made. The downfall for me, which lead to a return, was the size. It is a huge case, that isn‚Äôt really made apparent in the advertising photos. I have a average sized wrist for a male, and this case hangs over both sides of my wrist by a few mm in each side. Makes the slim sleek Apple Watch very blocky and bulky."
2.0,Bottle came broken and the lunchbox was to small to fit a kid size lunch in with water bottle.
2.0,This shirt was so wrinkled it took me 30 mins to iron it!!
2.0,Super tiny don‚Äôt show hardly at all
2.0,Not a good material. Super thin
2.0,The ring is very cute but it was sized way too small. I ordered a size 8 and got a size 6.
2.0,"Not even CLOSE to a large size. Fabric nice, packaging nice, fit...not so nice."
2.0,"Looks Ok, except that the hardware is very cheap. Main problem is that the interior reeks of old fish. I'm not particularly sensitive to odors, but if you are, you should probably buy something else. Apparently this is a thing with &#34;vegan leather&#34; (back in the day it was just &#34;imitation leather&#34; but I guess vegan sounds hipper) so I looked online for a solution. 48 hrs with an open cup of white vinegar inside didn't do the trick. I will give it another 48, but if it still smells nauseating after that, it'll have to go back."
2.0,STONES FELL OUT IN BOX .
2.0,Way too small. I ordered a 3x and I wear a 14 :(
2.0,"I love these headbands, the color and the fabric. But they hurt my head because where the fabric gathers it's too thick."
2.0,Don‚Äôt get if you have big tatas lol. Very sheer and tight at the breast area.
2.0,"I purchased for my grandmother, they are beautiful, especially the stitching, but the material is very very thin, also, they run small, I purchased a large, should have gotten a extra large."
2.0,Cute boot but not for me.
2.0,"Really bad, is losing the paint And I only used it twice"
2.0,Thin Material didn‚Äôt like
2.0,Nice watch but band was so small I couldn't use the watch.
2.0,Really wanted this to fit so I could wear it with my red cowgirl boots but even the XL was too small.
2.0,Runs very small in size and is not the best quality.
2.0,not the quality I expected
2.0,I bought it to wear for my brother‚Äôs graduation ceremony but returned it due to ill fit<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice material and pattern<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Breast area was too stretched out when I wore it
2.0,"Cute, but runs very small. Had to return."
2.0,"Would‚Äôve really liked it but far too short in the length of the suit, even order up a size. I‚Äôm not that tall at5‚Äô8‚Äù and it was just too short üò© style was cute but had to return due to fit."
2.0,This item was bought for my wife and two days later it tarish and turn colors
2.0,My son was so excited to hold his favorite Pok√©mon cards in this. He carried it around for 10 days and then his favorite 2 cards were lost because the plastic sheets ripped. It really could‚Äôve been worse as the sheets were all ripping. Do not buy for children.<br />2 stars because would be nice if sitting on a shelf untouched.
2.0,"This is not a sweatshirt, it‚Äôs satin."
2.0,"After the first day, the pink from the front of the boots were already coming off. I may be returning this."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap - ring broke in half.
2.0,They are quite large and look kind of cheap.
2.0,Pretty stone.
2.0,This was tight and small. Made for a stick figure. Too bad because I liked the style. Had to return it.
2.0,"My daughter wore this for one day, and the top flap (for lack of a better word) rubbed against the top of her foot until it was rather red and raw. I'd love to return it."
2.0,"The dress itself was a beautiful dress. However, I was looking for a mother of the bride dress and it seemed more like a Disney princess dress. I received the label to send it back to China and imagine my surprise when the postage was $44.75!!!!!  I have seen many other beautiful dresses on Amazon, not from China, with free returns or the ‚Äútry before you buy‚Äù option. I would suggest either of those before you take a chance on having to spend a ridiculous amount of money to send back a dress that isn‚Äôt right  for you."
2.0,I wasn't too impressed with this bra... I didn't get the support that I usually get when I get different ones in target and you can see the mark of the bra with my dress on. I had to adjust the bra several times( 3√ó's) and by the time I was some what content the area were its supposed to lift up your breast wouldn't hold on as I was hoping for. The only reason I gave a 2 ‚≠ê is because I really like the fact that the stickiness didn't touch the nipple area so is perfect for ppl with allergy symptoms or sensitive skin.
2.0,"The fabric is thin velvet, not like the photo. It will not be effective in chilly weather. Almost looks like a costume. The fur is shedding and flat. The size is short. I'm 5'0 only and won't cover my behind. Promptly returned. Item not as pictured. Definitely not worth $30 to me."
2.0,too heavy to wear
2.0,one size does not fit all.  too tight.  not a comfort fit.  one side fit all with no options.  Good price for budget.
2.0,Dress rises up while walking!! Too short
2.0,"If you wear a small in the US, then order an XL.  This shirt is so small."
2.0,These glasses were just a little too big and didn't meet my expectations for style. I'm sure with the right sized nose and head these would work.
2.0,Not flattering on me.  I'm slim everywhere except on the midsection.  It made me look huge.
2.0,This coat was extremely thin - I ended up returning it.
2.0,"The sweater‚Äôs color was as shown in the photo. However, the material was not soft and the collar is tighter than what the picture shows. I am returning the item."
2.0,"Nice dress,  however sizing was about 2 sizes smaller,  definitely size up if you do not have a slim body type."
2.0,"Very cheap material. The plaid part is a shiny polyester and doesnt match the rest of the fabrics. I normally wear a size small or medium, i ordered the medium and it was pretty tight for what appeared to be a looser fitting shirt. I returned it."
2.0,"The fit seems ok with a tiny waistband but I can‚Äôt have my 3 yr old wear something thats completely see through. Described as a Cotton Blend... this more like gauze or muslin material. Where we live the sun is bright most all the time, you can see RIGHT THROUGH this. Very disappointed."
2.0,"The material for the top-half is very see-through. I'm not at all busty so it's not that I was stretching the Medium thin. Also this is much too long for anyone under 5'9&#34;; I would have had to hem it and I didn't have time. A good dress for a very tall, pencil thin girl. Return process is super easy."
2.0,"The clasp broke after two weeks. Otherwise, it was an excellent watch."
2.0,Estan bonitos pero se mancharon de negro
2.0,Did not fit as expected.  Mens robe was way too short.
2.0,The material is uncomfortable.  It took forever to arrive.  Disappointed.
2.0,"It's rather large and bulky like a child's costume prop, also looks to be filled with silver glitter.<br />Not an exact replica."
2.0,"Front of these pants are awesome, but I returned them because the butt pockets are set so high up it looks silly!! Super disappointed because I really did like the fit a lot and the feel of them."
2.0,"I bought a large expecting at least a large or medium fit. I could not even get the leg holes past my thighs. I wear a medium in American sizes so I thought I should buy a large.<br />The boob cups definitely fit a small B. They did not even cover half of my boob lol, I am a large C.<br />The material and color look awesome, unfortunately it won't fit me.<br />I bought this suit at a discount for a unbiased review."
2.0,"Can't tell you about fit or construction because the feel of the fabric was so NOT cotton or soft.  Feels really synthetic and not something I want close to my skin, so it was going back regardless."
2.0,First off I bought a large and it was too big but I tried it for a few days and the back wasn't flat against your back it had ripples which show with the clothes I wore .... The material seemed decent.... But the bulges was a no no I bought a medium so I'm waiting for that to come and then I'll see if that has bulges as well if not then I purchased to big...the bottom was rolling a bit as well....... Ok so I bought a medium and it fits well but it still has a bubble like in the back and it scrounges together it seems fine for now
2.0,I wanted to love these shorts and did when I took them out of the packaging. After 1 wash they are a mess. The hem is coming out of them and the elastic band in the waist is twisted and odd. I attempted to iron them and it yielded little if any improvement. Very disappointing product.
2.0,It would be great if the bands went on the posts over half of my bands will not go on the posts the sewn holes are to small
2.0,Stones look almost black. Not at all like stone in necklace. Why would you sell them both but have them so different?
2.0,This jacket looks NOTHING like waht I received. the jacket is frumpy and frankly can onlhy wear it inside the house to stay warm. If it wasnt $13 I would of returned it.
2.0,Very short. Very small. Very disappointed.
2.0,"It‚Äôs too bad. These fit awesome and didn‚Äôt leak whatsoever. But because of the curved glass, everything is so distorted underwater that you really can‚Äôt focus on anything. I‚Äôm going to keep them, because they‚Äôre handy for retrieving the occasional dropped pair of sunglasses in the lake, but I was really hoping I would be able to dive down and explore with a clear view of everything."
2.0,"cheap, it gets tangled a lot"
2.0,"The coat is a good product but not true to sizing, i gave the coat to a friend because it was very small for a 2xx."
2.0,"These socks do seem very well made, but they are very difficult to put on and they are bulky. They are very close to resembling a boot sock. They take up a lot of room in the shoe, and the toe seams have threads and fabric that are difficult to arrange for comfort. I regret tossing the packing so I can‚Äôt send them back."
2.0,I bought this for my daughter.  Thank heaven I didn't pay a great deal for it.  I would not spend over 10.00 for this wig and that is counting shipping.  I can tell already that it will be a rats nest in 2 weeks.  Reminds you of long doll hair....need I say more with a child playing with it.
2.0,I was not happy with the quality of the nightgown.  High priced for the thin material!
2.0,The undershorts are fine but I didn‚Äôt like the fabric on the actual shorts. They do run pretty small.
2.0,Thin shirt but cute
2.0,Rough edges on a few stones and the stone in this picture looks like it‚Äôs about to crack. Disappointed.
2.0,Bust line was too small and tight. Everything else was ok.
2.0,Wrong description. They should mention that it‚Äôs a transparent dress. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt wear it‚Ä¶  Not recommended. Also you pay the shipping if you want to return‚Ä¶
2.0,"I purchased two of these dresses for a funeral; one black and one that was supposed to be navy. I'm a size 12 usually, sometimes a 14 in fitted styles. I typically wear a Med-large in most shirts and dresses. Based on reviews and experience with Asian manufacturing, I purchased the largest size available. One didn't fit me at all, and the other was much more snug that I would have liked.  I was able to wear the black dress because black &#34;hides&#34; imperfections better. It was pretty enough and mostly comfortable, but would have been WAY more comfortable and flattering if it was sized properly. (In order to wear it, I needed to wear control top hose, pulled way up to &#34;smooth&#34; things out. I really DESPISE panty hose, especially control top and never wear them. But because I needed the dress right away, I didn't have any choice).<br /> The &#34;navy&#34; blue was NOT navy. I received it and thought they'd sent the wrong one since it was a slate blue/grey color and said 14/16 while I had ordered 16/18.  I sent it back and the replacement sent to me was the same color, and it also still said 14/16. (The black dress barely fit my size 12/14 body. The slate colored one (which was supposed to be navy) didn't fit at all! This would NEVER fit a size 16-18 woman unless you're interested in being extremely uncomfortable and enjoy showing every inch of fat on your body."
2.0,Kind of womanly...my husband wouldn't wear it
2.0,It's very tiny looks larger in pic and the quality is not good at all
2.0,"These were nice, but CHEAP plastic.  NOT really DG - but a copy.  I have real DG sunglasses and they are heavier and have lasted me years.  Too big for my face too!  I will not ever order sunglasses on-line.  It's hit and miss as you have to try them on first!  Not worth the $ to send back so gave them to a friend who they fit better and needed a spare pair for her car."
2.0,"Rides up in the back, chest circumference is too loose. I am like a C cup."
2.0,"See through fabric. Very cheaply made. Doesn‚Äôt sit right or fit in the right places at all. And the slit comes up so high, you‚Äôll be showing your vagina all night."
2.0,I liked the color of the lenses but visions not as clear as other lenses when looking through.
2.0,I really like the style and color but the piece between the toe very uncomfortable
2.0,"Product seemed well made. Until the second week of use, and the strap stiching came undone."
2.0,Coloring is way off as the other reviewer described.  The tull is a blue blue and the bodice is more on the teal side.
2.0,"I ordered one size larger because I want a loose and comfortable fit. Unfortunately, the shorts are a bit tight even if the size is supposedly larger than my actual size. I'll hang on to the set though, I like the material."
2.0,"Ordered both colors. Very pretty, the sparkle is great. First wear, l looked down and lot of gaps where stones were. I am not hard on shoes either. Sending the second pair back, luckily l didnt wear them."
2.0,"Ok where do I start? This dress looks so gorgeous in the picture. I mean it‚Äôs breath taking, but when I took it out the package it was so cheap looking and ugly. The sticking is horrible not to mention the size. I really wanted this dress now I‚Äôm about to send it back and look for something else. üôÅ"
2.0,"Okay well I DID like this, for the two weeks it lasted. Then the lining ripped in a dozen places and I let my cats have it to play with. Nice color but not good quality."
2.0,Umm 2 pairs of sun sleeves did not arrive.. 1 pair arrived. Is there another pair on the way?
2.0,too bulky for us.
2.0,Ripped in only 2 wears cheap boxers
2.0,They‚Äôre ok for the price but the size is too big and awkward
2.0,The clasp was not working. It did not keep the watch on.
2.0,"I was disappointed with this hoodie. It is SO cheap- the fabric is very thin and only helpful in the air conditioning to cover your arms.  The fabric is also this almost scratchy material so it isn't soft at all.  Has a little bit of a weird shape to it.  The zipper works well and it's fine for just putting over your arms, but won't be wearing this much."
2.0,"Just got this bag.. at first totally loved it!! It has a cute travel quote on the outside and is nicely sewn! Then.. as I was checking out the pockets I found an Old Navy tag.. I was thinking ‚Äúhmm this is weird, I wonder how that got there?‚Äù Then in the next pocket I found a used tube of chapstick! This bag was obviously used and returned. Not happy.. will be returning."
2.0,I really like this purse. The Handle broke(the clip). Made poorly.
2.0,fits about a size smaller than marked
2.0,"Beautiful but way too small, need to go up 2 size up...had to return sadly and didnt have time to order anothet one. Had to leave for trip."
2.0,Not very effective. Loud noises are still loud and feel damaging to ears.
2.0,"My 7 year old needed black pants for a dance performance so I ordered these, advertised as one printed and one solid.  The solid pants have shimmery gold stripes.  Completely unexpected.  Also both pairs came with loose threads, poor quality overall."
2.0,"Great shipping and packaging, but unfortunately the product is teeny, tiny. My 14 yr old size 6 can't fit in them. :("
2.0,"Great design and nice look and feel. However, if you have any semblance of a calve, they will not fit. The shoe itself fit my foot fine, could not zip above the ankle."
2.0,"It's very large and fits very loosely, definitely not 7"" inner diameter as described."
2.0,"For some reason the app does not allow me to add a pic but, the watch looks better in person than I expected. It has a nice weighted feel as well. Two tool were included to remove links. Super easy. Additionally, a leather bracelet was included. Definitely recommend purchase.<br /><br />(Updated)<br />This watch keeps terrible time. Maybe it's a fluke and I simply got a bad one, but it's Baaad!"
2.0,Beautiful dress but way too small...ordered larger than usual but fit was still way too small.
2.0,It was too small for my liking.
2.0,Good quality. But was not true to size. Size larger than expected.
2.0,"Perfect fit! But the pattern is so different from pics. Had darker spots in stripes that made it look asymmetrical in a bad way, black, white, and yellow color, not the beautiful rich colors in the pics.<br />I don‚Äôt think I like the other patterns but I might see if there‚Äôs one I like, because the fit is amazing. I‚Äôm pretty curvy and this was perfect. Skimming and stretchy but not vacuum packed. Wish the pattern was the same‚Äîit would be my new favorite! Back it goes."
2.0,Pretty itchy and size was smaller than I usually wear.
2.0,The glasses are literally microscopic and meant for a doll.
2.0,"As expected for the price, the quality of construction is less than a Patagonia product or, merino expert, IceBreaker: ($35 vs $60, deeply discounted).  The kicker is my junk falls out because the fly is poorly designed.  Not sure it's a anatomical issue unique to me.  The overlap is minimal and the outcome is just not an acceptable situation.<br /><br />I might put a button on them like some of my boxers and call it good.  Wish I had checked out SierraTradingPost.com and gotten some dicounted Ice Breakers. (Not a plug, simply had great luck with many brands with this retailer.)  [...]<br /><br />Ideal baselayer = heat in + junk in .  I'll pass on including a photo!"
2.0,"I wear size 10, so I purchased size 10. The felt like a size 9 on with thin socks so I suggest ordering up a size."
2.0,Runs super small. Arms are t-shirt material. Body of shirt very thin. Returning.
2.0,"These pants LOOKED really comfy in the picture---not so much in real life. The fabric they're made from is cheap-feeling and scratchy.. NOT cotton, nor is it the fabric most lounge pants/sweatpants are made from. They run REALLY small; I usually order a Large, but wanted these to be loose-fitting for sleeping, too, so I ordered an XL... they are waayyy too small to be an XL... perhaps a Medium, but nowhere NEAR an XL!! The skull print on the fabric is shoddy; it looks like it will flake off with time and the cloth feels rather rough in my hands... NOT really what I want to sleep in! A shame; they COULD be cute if they upgraded the fabric/print. The SELLER is fantastic-- shipping was very fast... too bad these were such a disappointment. Debating returning them."
2.0,"I really do like it, but the chain broke after one time of trying it on and I haven't been able to wear it."
2.0,"These pajamas run small. Bought the purple sloth ones in a 4T that looked more like 3T. The top was very short. There is no stretch to the material. Cute pattern, but the sloths  (iron on print) felt cold and uncomfortable. Not a cozy pj. I had to return them."
2.0,"Although advertised as leather, this purse gave off overpowering chemical fumes as soon as I opened the bag.  The smell was so strong I never even finished taking it out of the bag -- just sealed it back up to return.  I would question whether this is made of leather or polyurethane.  I also thought the color was a bit darker than shown - more of a raspberry sherbet than a &#34;T-Mobile&#34; magenta -- but that could be just monitor settings."
2.0,"The slot that holds your license is too small I can't even get my license back out, also the area where you put your dollars is compact and to small"
2.0,Too late for me to return due to the time I need this. Will bring it with me on vacation but item is huge and not as expected.
2.0,Fit much smaller than advertised
2.0,"The compression leads right up to the calf, where it cuts off! Very uncomfortable. also thinner than normal socks, so feels uncomfortable  in my normal shoes. The toe and heel are cut out weird. overall just doesn't fit well or feel comfortable. :("
2.0,the charm on the necklace wasn‚Äôt attached to the necklace and won‚Äôt stay on. I‚Äôm kind of upset that this happened.
2.0,Not as nice looking as the pictures shows and it strongly smells like mold.
2.0,I would have given this product a good rating but it is missing the belt that its advertised as having.
2.0,Didn't fit as expected and I followed their measurements. returned it.
2.0,"The dress didnt fit the style the bride was looking for, and although a beautiful Dress I had to return. Which was a complete pain! The company refused to give me my refund. So I had to go directly to amazon..."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress because it fit perfectly in all the right places. But the shoulders were too loose and I would have been pulling it up all night.<br /><br />I tried a medium and a small, both had the same issue."
2.0,"It was for my wife.  It fits as expected, sadly there was a pulled thread in the seam.  She liked the dress but that defect in the seam rest points."
2.0,Cute & unique band but the elastic is way too tight. It started to cut my circulation off. I couldn‚Äôt even wear my watch.
2.0,"This product arrived quickly and the color is as pictured- a very pretty turquoise. The yarn feels cheap and the weave looks chunky and not very high quality. I have tried to wear this sweater multiple times and every time I have to go back to Amazon and see how to put it on,but it still looks strange. I won't wear this because it's so hard to put on, and it's not soft or nice enough to put in the effort."
2.0,"If I hadn't been wearing Wigwam socks for years I might not have noticed these are not as described.  The socks came in a bag marked Wigwam but they do not have the vent strip and the cotton blend is off even according to it's own package. Very disappointed Amazon allows this to happen, will return these and order directly from the Wigwam website. Bottom sock in my picture is what these are supposed to be, top sock is what I received."
2.0,I don't feel that it is for high impact such as running.  Did not feel that it fit well - will not reorder
2.0,it did not come with g2 clip on set it pictured it with.<br />so iwas ot able to use it without permantly attaching it.
2.0,The. Necklace is nice but it does not shine like the picture shows.
2.0,"About a month after ordering I received an email saying the dress had shipped. Instead of a dress I received a trinket bracelet and the company marked the order as &#34;delivered.&#34; After getting Amazon involved, and many emails, they actually shipped the dress. I ordered a size based on my bigger measurement - my waist. It was still tight in the waist but the bust was huge and the arm holes were extremely small. The length was long but I expected to need to hem it. I kept it because the lace and fabric are nice and I like the style. That said, I had to pay a seamstress twice as much as I spent on the dress to have a dress that I can wear. And I won't be very comfortable. They use extremely hard interfacing and boning in the bodice. The bodice was so stiff it looked like it could stand up on it's own. If every one of your measurements match those on their guideline sheet you might try it but if not, avoid buying."
2.0,I didn't like the lense shape.
2.0,Cheap China stuff. Not happy Amazon !
2.0,The rings tended to color my fingers green & most of them have broken in half. I bought these for a one time event & I'm glad that they were on the cheap side. One of the rings broke in half the first time I wore it. One of the others had a burr on it & I had to smooth it out with a file before I could even wear the ring. I wouldn't recommend these if you want them to last more than 2 or 3 wears.
2.0,"5‚Äô9‚Äù 165, atheletic build. I wear an 8 to a 10 depending on the brand. I would say this is an Asian large which is a 6. I could put this on, but it was too tight, and even if I lost 5 to 10 pounds the fit would not have been like the model. Also, the first couple of pics of this skirt are deceptive they picture a completely different skirt with a large herringbone pattern. The last pics are accurate. It is a small herringbone patterned skirt. The material is nice, just not sized correctly. Also the measurements are off. I measure myself before ordering anything off of Amazon. This skirt is about a full inch off on all the measurements listed."
2.0,"Turned brassy, and was silver when I bought it :( but i loved the way it looked on me!!!"
2.0,"Not good, the moon was disconnected from the chain n from the circle the second day I use.  *I love the design but they need to do it different"
2.0,"Gets 2 stars for cuteness and that's all it has to offer....weird fit, unable to tighten it up."
2.0,"Gorgeous style and color, I got the light blue choice. The problem was the glitter. The background fabric had a coating of glitter that fell all over the floor and me. I took it outside and shook it and lightly brushed my hand down it but still the glitter fell. Had to return it."
2.0,This product broke within a couple days of purchasing it.<br /><br />I'm not complaining because - obviously - it is very cheap and I wasn't expecting Sterling silver by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />Just be knowledgeable that you're going to get exactly what you paid for.
2.0,The glove finger tips are way too long. And touch screen ready? Not even.
2.0,Bought these at an outdoor store. Disappointed enough to review on Amazon. No better than any other brand of black socks. Don't expect them to be very breathable.
2.0,Very bad Quality
2.0,The beads get tangled when you wear them. They do not last long.
2.0,"Love the top and the material, however, this is made very small.  Have to return"
2.0,Not water resistant or water proof. Pictures are beautiful.
2.0,"considering my order was for a 3x i have to say yes, it wasn't a great order."
2.0,Too big .. bought a 8 since I wear  a 8.5 but straps are too large and 8 is too big . Pissed I really wanted these slippers to fit right.
2.0,It's listed as a necklace and earring set but no earrings
2.0,"I knew that this thing couldn't have been the list price that it claimed, but the watch looks fake.  I did get comments on it because its noticeable, but when I look at it close up I feel like I paid too much for it.  Hey, it keeps the time though."
2.0,"I love how cute these are but the butterflies are just silky fabric and one fell out the first time I wore them. Also, I was trying to bend the hooks to fit me better (which I do with all of my earrings) and the hook broke so I will have to replace it after wearing them once."
2.0,"I received this bag on 9/15/2020, it is a nice bag inside and out, but the one of the straps has already broken, barely had it more than a week.. not good quality."
2.0,"I love the glasses, but they arrived scratched and to return them costs as much as they cost.  So, I'm stuck with glasses that I love that are too scratched for me to wear them.  It's a pity."
2.0,Very thin material and poor quality assembly.
2.0,"Seems cheap because a decal is pasted, rather than embroidered to the cap."
2.0,"My daughter is 6 and didn't fit in the size 7 shorts, such a bummer. I had to return them and buy other shorts. Sizing inconsistencies are so frustrating."
2.0,The fit is fine but the quality is not great. My daughter only wore it once and one shoulder strap tore off and the threads came loose on the gathers at the top and get started to fall apart. Sad because it is a really cute dress.
2.0,"I am 5'3&#34; and it doesn't reach the floor with no shoes on (maybe an inch above the ground). That has literally never happened to me, I'm not that tall. The dress fit great other than that though. I ordered a small and I am about 120 pounds"
2.0,"These didn't fit over my calves. The rest of the leg and the waistband was fine, but apparently these weren't made for people with muscular legs."
2.0,Not what I expected for the visor part was Velcro and hard to see through
2.0,"The color is exact. However, the fit is extremely large. I weigh 170 pounds and the sweater swallows me."
2.0,Runs a size smaller or two depending<br />But I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it so I'm going to keep it even though I'm not happy
2.0,"Material was see-through, the sides of the material don't drape well (literally comes to a point on either sides of hips)"
2.0,One of the boots is different from. The other! Defective product for the amount of money spent
2.0,As per the side guide I bought a small and I def should have gone for a size up.  I'm returning this product
2.0,The nightgown fit ok. It was a little big but the part that I couldn't stand was how scratchy the material was especially around the sleeves. I returned it. There's no way I could've slept in that.
2.0,I received this item and not even a minute after opening it one of the finger cuffs broke. BEFORE My child had the chance to even slip it on.
2.0,I love the color but the quality isn't the best and they are too thin you can see my colored underwear. So basically I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing these in public. No tummy control and they sit too low on the waist.
2.0,I just don't know why this dress is so unflattering.  I always buy this style and material of dress and it's fits me nicely. I like a dress to be fit to my breasts and waist while being loose on my belly and hips. It appears that it would fit perfect but as soon as I put it on it hugged all the wrong places. It's not that it's too small it's just awkwardly sewn. I would definitely not buy again. I feel like a thinner woman would look fine in it but anyone with any extra weight should probably go for a different brand.
2.0,"I was excited to see a dress without a defined waist line, but this dress does not look good on me.  Fabric seems soft, but so easy to wrinkle and it arrived extremely wrinkled.  I am 5'1"" and the extra large came to my ankles - Yuk.  The princess seams could be attractive, but some of them are not straight and don't look right.  The ""beige"" dress actually is very tan.  I returned the three dresses.  For the purple dress, the dye didn't look even and the seams also looked uneven.  The size large was too tight and the extra large didn't look right either.  Sorry to write a bad review.  I guess others like the dresses because a lot have been sold."
2.0,The picture is NOT an accurate display photo at all! I have to put it on top of ear because it is so HUGE. But it is beautiful though.
2.0,PRETTY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE TWO GREYS ARE DIFFERENT. SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY AND IT'S HARD TO TELL ON SCREEN. I WOULD EXCHANGE FOR WHITE INSTEAD. NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.
2.0,"My neck is 15 1/4&#34;, so I tried the medium.  However, the height of the collar is much too tall for me.  I'm thinking they made this tall enough to work for a man.  I am 5'4&#34;<br /><br />Also, the velcro continually caught my hair, pulling it out of my braid."
2.0,Okay....for the price but much bigger in size then I expected!
2.0,"I'm only giving two stars because this ring doesn't have much sparkle and it came to me damaged, there is a chipped piece of the band that stabs the inside on your finger when you wear it.  One reviewer commented on the band being too thin but I like the thin, daintiness of the band.  I guess it fits the price though."
2.0,Very very poorly made. Broke first time I tried to put on.  Did not even try to return as it took a month to get them üôÅ
2.0,The style and fit were not what I was hoping for. So I did return them. Rather inexpensively made but to be fair the price did reflect that.
2.0,"1 star for being black<br />1 star for having 3 holes<br />Unless you are a balarina robbing a bank, this fit is not correct."
2.0,This bracelet is very cheaply made & very flimsy. The charm holder broke off in the first hour of being worn. I was able to rig it to stay but it started coming apart after that. It looks super nice on but I don‚Äôt recommend buying it.
2.0,"Pros: fit, flattering, comfortable<br />Cons: horrible fabric that looks like your old favorite that you‚Äôve washed a million times so it‚Äôs faded and pilling so you finally have to throw it out because you can‚Äôt even donate it, seams are sewn terribly with strings hanging off everywhere. Just don‚Äôt."
2.0,"I had great expectations for this dress based on the reviews. I got the Navy Blue (large) with the lace top and solid skirt. I am 5' 5&#34;, 168lbs with a 34D chest. The dress did fit but the fit was very unflattering for me particularly around the waist band which could have been tighter. The cut was just not right. Made me look very frumpy."
2.0,"This top was the perfect weight with the coverage I wanted for running/walking outside, but the zipper broke after I wore it once. Very poor quality and would not recommend. Quite disappointed."
2.0,"Beautiful camisole,  runs small and is very clingy"
2.0,beautiful necklace but i had to discard it since it was already rusted.
2.0,Pretty but very poor workmanship.Gave away.
2.0,"The sizing was way too big and the shorts were mostly black , you only see the blue shorts underneath if you are in a major wind. It looked and felt cheap."
2.0,"I am a size 6-8 depending on the brand. I got this in a medium thinking I would fit just fine because of some other reviews. Maybe I am just too tall (5'5"") but this is way too short. Everything else seems to fit just fine but I can't imagine that it would be as short as it is for any reason. Kinda bummed because it looked super cute!"
2.0,Would have liked this if the quality was a little better. The fabric is so thin that it's see through. Plus it runs big and isn't elastic enough. Too loose for a bathing suit
2.0,It is very difficult to get the pocket watch into the glass dome and once in it is even more difficult to attach it to the hook.
2.0,"I‚Äôm only giving the low star because I ordered this Scrub cap pictured above and I really love the design. Unfortunately, I was sent a totally different design and this not want to go through the hassle of exchanging."
2.0,"to small, returning it."
2.0,"The leggings ran on the smaller side. They also come up REALLY high. Yes they won't fall down, but better if you wear loose tops with your leggings. Got a hole in the inner thigh after 1 use."
2.0,Very lightly tinted.  I prefer darker sunglasses.  Reader panes as expected
2.0,"From the picture, the dress looks like its a permissible length, but upon receipt, the dress is really short!! OMG I thought maybe the dress was a petite size, that's how short it is! Its a mini-dress."
2.0,the connector would not click and lock on to my fitbit.  it would just fall off my wrist.  also the first velcro section isnt fully attached to the band either.  getting a refund.  it was comfortable though.
2.0,"Definitely needed a smaller size however I don't remember it it came in XS. I'm almost always a small in bottoms, but this felt more like a medium on the larger side."
2.0,"This is really really pretty, but it hurt my ear so badly I had to take it off in the middle of a wedding."
2.0,Have to iron and it runs small
2.0,Looks cute but poor quality.
2.0,"Runs small and very see through. It worked for what we needed it for only because I was seeing/gluing faux fur on it to make it a catsuit. If you‚Äôre buying to wear on it‚Äôs own, look elsewhere."
2.0,A tool was included to help with adjusting the watch strap. It was very difficult to adjust the strap while on the wrist. It's a pretty strap and what I was looking for but not consumer friendly.
2.0,I was able to give it away as a gift
2.0,"Not the same dress, it runs big with plenty of stretch.  However the color is more purplish, pinkish, burgundy instead of bright red as pictured. Im 5""4 180 and ordered a sz medium"
2.0,size smaller than posted
2.0,Did not provided the same sensory feed back as K tape for postural support.
2.0,"I like the fabric but it's so small! I'm a small adult and can use it in some ways, but twisting and doubling produced a head covering no larger than a beanie."
2.0,Low quality fabric...
2.0,"You get what you pay for and this is a cheap, wire wrist band!"
2.0,The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it looks good. It performed poorly. I spent 4 weeks in Africa both desert and jungle. On every use it failed to keep me warm with the exception where the days were 67 degrees or above. It was less productive under damp conditions. left it in Africa.
2.0,This dress runs real small. I order my correct dize but it still to to small was vefy disappointing. Pretty dress was ordering for a wedding this august two stars because dress was pretty but sizing way off
2.0,"They look well made and fit but I pulled them out of the box to see they had black on the soles and the heels are worn down. I‚Äôm disappointed because I paid price for new. My child has not worn them around yet, just tried them on, so I‚Äôm concerned they will hurt her feet. That‚Äôs the only reason I can think someone returned these after wearing, unless they just wanted them for one day. They are very cute. Still, the seller should not be reselling used products at new prices.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />Child liked these so much and did not cause any sores. They were a go to shoe most of the time and lasted well until they didn‚Äôt fit anymore. I would buy them again. Everyone complimented them!"
2.0,Fabric was of poor quality<br />Seams not smooth
2.0,This jacket is flimsy and the sleeves are ruched so it does not go to the cuff as displayed!! It is cheap and not classy at all! Too small! Order it larger but for better fit but it still has sleeves that are 3/4! Big disappointment!
2.0,"Dress doesn't look as I expected. The material is really thin and no disrespect but it looks pretty cheap. Shipping was fast, but I do not think I would order this dress again."
2.0,"Adorable fabric, didn't like the cut length and it was a little bigger than anticipated. Also fairly see- through because of thin fabric."
2.0,I try them and now they in a corner.. I have a big head and the masks were still too big..
2.0,"It works for an accessory to add color to your outfit. Fabric is thin and cheap, not at all meant to keep you warm as a jacket."
2.0,"Updated 071220: After trying to use this for the first time I found half the pockets were defective. They were not properly cut and sewn. Too bad because up until I tried to use it, it seemed like what I wanted. I guess I will keep using my old one and hope I can find my new old stock one from 25 years ago that I was keeping in case my current one wears out."
2.0,You can NOT I repeat NOT see any engraving on it and ours only says daddy‚Äôs girl love on it. Completely disappointed! Crap! Do not buy!
2.0,Looks nice but it's to small or tight on my wife's feet
2.0,the fit is not consistent at all
2.0,Itchy cheap fabric and it was HUGE on me. I typically wear M or L and should've gone with an M instead of L with this dress. However I would've returned it anyways due to the poor quality. Sleeves were very large and ruffly- felt a bit ridiculous.
2.0,The glitter on the material kept coming off on my hand and dress. Also if you have a fine material dress (such as lace) it will snag the material. Not for me and had to return. Otherwise it is a pretty bag.
2.0,Looks nice but the metal clasp digs into my wrist
2.0,"I like how dark these are, how light weight they are and how they fit over my frames.  However, they are very fragile and the plastic ‚Äúpins‚Äù are tiny that connect the nose piece with the lenses break very easily.<br />Not worth the money."
2.0,The colors are just as expected from the photo but the dress ran small and didn't fit right and the fabric felt like those giant parachute things we used to play with in elementary school.
2.0,"The ad said the bandanas were double-sided, but in actuality, they are only finished on one side. Too much trouble to send them back or I would . . ."
2.0,I love it but after the first wash one of the straps broke and now I am going to have to fixed it before wearing it again üòì kind of disappoint with that part but over all pretty cute .
2.0,"One side is made for tension control (i.e. feed the strap through and it will hold in place with tension). The other side, however, is useless unless one can sew the strap into place, which is what I did. I don't understand why both sides are not tension/adjustable."
2.0,"I ordered this in gold and when it came out of the box, I thought it looked cheap.  I think this would be a nice bag in a different color.  I sent the gold bag back to Amazon."
2.0,Top is too big.
2.0,"I thought that this would be a great idea as I live in a state that has a lot of sunshine.  While I am not into the bow, the idea that I could fold this flat and carry it with me was appealing to me.  I didn‚Äôt realize that something billed as 50 SPF would not have a crown.  So basically my face is protected but the top of my head and hair are not,,,, just crazy.<br />This is a nice sun visor and I liked the blend of colors, it adjusts size wise with the velcroed bow, but with no protection for the top of your head, I‚Äôd say look for a real sun HAT"
2.0,"The colors & price for these are good. Although some of the colors are very close. The gauge is tiny. Smaller than standard ear piercing, which is 18. These are probably 20?? The stone is small as well and slides in slightly to my nose. The most frustrating part is the curve. It's very awkward and does not go in smoothly. Something I dislike because I like to take it in/out regularly and with 16 month old,very active, twin boys, I don't have time to struggle to get it back in. I read the reviews but I have a small nose do I thought they'd be perfect. I'd return them but it's not worth the hassle since I needed something quickly so my hole did not shut. I will likely go to a piercing/tattoo studio to get a solid piece and keep these for back up."
2.0,"Sloth pendant is very cute, but chain was broken when I received the necklace."
2.0,Cute but cheap. I would be happy if I paid less
2.0,I understand it's not real but dang. The green is lighter than in picture(would understand if gems were real but they're made. Missing the two green jewels in the two green leafs. Wish I would have picked something else
2.0,It is comfortable but too short
2.0,"Order a size down, too big around the armpit area. More of a work dress with a blazer."
2.0,The neck ripped after one use.
2.0,The seam down the middle is awkward. Size up - runs small
2.0,They wear more like cotton than a moisture wicking material.  7 inch inseam
2.0,Sheds alot.
2.0,"The earings are very cute,I liked them a lot the only thing that I dont like it: after 2 days two crystal fell out  :-((((  ."
2.0,I ordered this item multiple times. Great design BUT the underwire keeps coming out.... returned and got a new one and same problem.
2.0,"Go up a size , I usually wear a medium and it was way too tight for me, unfortunately have to return. Also the picture is a lil misleading its way too body hugging ."
2.0,Was not suitable for cold as advertised. Material was far too thin and cold comes right through as well as wind. Construction seemed of fair quality. The fit was very small so it was difficult to change to the different options of wearing. Ultimately returned this item because it was needed for cold weather wear.
2.0,I was excited to get these shoes for my daughter to dress up for church and we pulled them out of the box and as she tried to tie the bow the loop just ripped. They were super poor quality . So now they are just regular flats without the bow because there is no way to hold the bow/ribbon in place anymore. They just ripped with tension. No good for toddler shoes.
2.0,"Attractive belt, but arrived with defect."
2.0,Smaller than expected and color was off. Looked more like a nightshirt. Returning it was a breeze
2.0,This didn't fit as expected. Colors are pretty and it was good quality for the price.
2.0,"As soon as I washed them, after trying them on my 7 year old when relieved they shrunk to what is basically a toddler size. Completely useless. The point of a reusable mask is to be washed, sanitized and unless you intended these for a toddler it is a waste of money"
2.0,These were too big for me and It cost just as much to return them as it did to purchase them so now I'm stuck with them.
2.0,This mask smells really bad. Its plastic/rubbery and doesn't hold much shape. Super cheap. Hopefully it will air out by the time a Halloween comes.
2.0,This was my favorite work lanyard until one of the lines of beads broke.  Not sure if I would repurchase in the future after only getting two months of use.
2.0,It‚Äôs a good sized bag with couple pockets and no branding. Materials are pretty cheap.  The zipper broke on first use.
2.0,"Al principio estaba bastante feliz con el pedido, pero la verdad es que ya se me comenzaron a romper... las sigo usando, claro, pero esperaba que duraran un poco m√°s..."
2.0,No area for breast way to small I normally run 1x got a 2x to make sure it fits but still ended up to small not in my waist but in my chest barley could breathe
2.0,Very cute but broke on first wear
2.0,"This was much, much larger than expected. Proportions seem off as well."
2.0,Not as delicate looking as the picture shows. Was bigger chain and triangle - overall clunky.
2.0,Too big. Returned them. My daughter is an exact 6. Was hoping there would be just a little grow room but sadly no.
2.0,"Beautiful, quality & would be flattering EXCEPT that the shirt is sheer across the midsection. Guessing most who want a modest suit DON'T want sheer. Very disappointing, as it was comfortable, fit well & the fabric felt great. The shorts did not seem as long as pictured though. I returned it due to the sheer fabric."
2.0,It's a sweater dress so I expected it to be more substantial than it is. Very thin fabric.
2.0,"I'm giving it a 2star because the shirt is pretty. But when I hand washed it,the elastic around the top part stretched out that it was a size XL. Had I known that I couldn't wash it before I wore it,I would've ordered something else. Had the shirt not strecthed out I would give the shirt a 5star because it's reallt pretty."
2.0,"Ordered 2xl, I'm a size 20. Was too small and too short for my torso."
2.0,"Not the sizes that I wanted, so partly my fault.  Although they look a lot smaller in the photo."
2.0,I purchased two of these and don't expect them to last long.  They are so lightweight and flimsy that the beading curls and twists.  I was hoping for something with an elegant drape.  This product isn't it.
2.0,Most of the earrings are nice except one pair that I was really excited for are different sizes. Plus a few the the earrings repeat. So I have multiple sets of heart studs. Kinda waste.
2.0,"This cardigan is great looking & has a great feel to it ---HOWEVER, nowhere in the description mentions that it needs to be dry-cleaned!!!  I don't like going to the dry-cleaners, its costly...so now I am almost afraid to wear it b/c I can't afford to have it dry-cleaned."
2.0,"Extremely dark lens, cuts out light to the point that for older eyes (people over 40) it will be difficult to see unless you are in direct, bright sunlight.  My eyes don't let in as much light as they did when I was in my 20s or 30s, and I found these sunglasses to be dangerous for driving, when I drove under an overpass I couldn't see much of anything.  The sunglasses are attractive, well constructed, fit nicely to the face, look like they will last, they are just designed only for younger eyes."
2.0,The bat wings are too much
2.0,Very stretchy and very see thru I even sized up and still very thin
2.0,"This shirt arrived much smaller than expected. The lettering was stuck to itself. When shirt was opened to lie flat, pieces of the lettering came off. Very see through fabric. It says dry clean only!?! Really? Cheaply made. Didn‚Äôt see anywhere on the info that it was being shipped from China."
2.0,Very cute online.. Came totally huge!
2.0,"Alas, this pretty bra with lots of lift and support has a fatal flaw. The ring on one shoulder strap has a sharp metallic edge due to poor quality control in manufacturing. It ground into my skin as soon as I put the bra on. No thanks."
2.0,Fell apart at the joint within a week. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Glasses are good but delivery took far too long
2.0,I know you can't expect to much from a $14 dress but I did think it was cotton or at least a cotton blend this dress is polyester and very shiny material. It looks as cheap as it is. I do like the fit and cut of the dress but the material looks sooooooo cheap.
2.0,good not bad
2.0,There started to come apart at the seams.
2.0,Product is great (5 STARS)  but the shipping is awful (2 STARS). Multiple shipping delays and various updates about modified ship dates that were completely inaccurate. NOT IMPRESSED. I will find another vendor for my flannel shirt needs.
2.0,The lens is too small and the nose bridge is narrow.
2.0,I got a size larger than I normally would and the only thing that fit properly were the bottoms. The skirt wrap was a handkerchief at best and to say the top had minimal coverage is an understatement. I‚Äôve seen better coverage with pasties.
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like how it fit
2.0,"After one-time soft hand wash, the breathing valve fell out."
2.0,I disliked  the leather buckle part I found it to be slightly excessive in size but other than that its fine .
2.0,On globe ripped when they came and sewn weird especially on the thumbs
2.0,It could be the way I pack but these do not work for me. The zipper broke on one after the first time I used it. I also feel they take up more space then being helpful.
2.0,"I thought it was unisex, but it was way too big for a women's watch.  I Had to return it."
2.0,Flimsy and completely lightweight plastic.
2.0,The blue on necklace is just painted on and makes it look very cheap
2.0,Gave as gift and was enjoyed
2.0,Although they are pretty‚Ä¶..most are no usable for shirts as indicated on pics in the ad.<br />That was the whole reason I bought them!
2.0,The top fit fine but the bottom was too large and fit funny. Very Cheap quality. In the process of sending it back.
2.0,"Not as expected.  I feel the color is off.  It is washed out and doesn't look like the photo.  The material is awful and doesn't breath at all and the neckline is much higher than the photo. My friends say it is cute, but it just wasn't what I expected."
2.0,Not seamless or soft. Completely wrong description. The only thing that is correct is that it‚Äôs camouflage.
2.0,Cheap ring. Would not recommend.
2.0,"Cheaply made, the toes are pointed which makes them look odd. Wish the stitching was done with more care to form the shoe appropriately."
2.0,"Ordered these specifically for a green digital camo gaither, got the old switcheroo...  Other than not getting what I wanted, these are fine.  We ordered a 4 pack for school they fit fine and were comfortable for a 3rd and 7th grader.  Also ordered the blue camo for the digital camo and it arrived as expected."
2.0,"This is on my husbands account. Wife making a review here. The material and design is really nice. However, the shirt looks much longer in the pic than it is in real life. Given the model's height, this is unexpected. Also, and perhaps this is my fault in not realizing, the shirt is truly a wrap in that if the sash becomes untied, you have one uncovered breast popping out. The thing that bothers me the most, however, is the cut of the sides - for some reason, the sides are cut to give you an &#34;hourglass&#34; shape, but not in a good way. It leads to a rounded side that sticks out and makes you look like you have a muffin top (in addition to one you may or may not already have). It reminds me of what the shoulders of a shirt you dried on a hanger look like, with the very distinct bulge that shouldn't be there. I'm thinking to sew it up on the sides to get rid of this. The sash for tying the shirt also doesn't seem to be designed in a manner that would allow for it to be tied on the side like in the picture; it is the same length on both ends and tying it on the side leaves one very long and one very short piece of sash with which to make a bow. I just tie it in the back. Overall I am planning on keeping the shirt but I plan to make some of my own alterations."
2.0,Too small and was missing the belt
2.0,Cute but totally see through.<br />Returned it...
2.0,"Unfortunately, the sizes represented by the seller are incorrect and run VERY much smaller than stated. We are unable to use this product."
2.0,"The word ""Great"" was spelled graet, on six of the keychains."
2.0,Don't even think about clapping your hands. The clasp releases if you even glance at it for too long. The slightest movement of your hand will cause the clasp to disengage. Good luck getting the clasp to lock when you first put it on. I would recommend never taking it off again once you get it on.
2.0,The hooks are very weak. It was damaged as I first touched.
2.0,LIke the product. Did not like the advertising saying it is a Thing 1 and a Thing 2 costume.  We were expecting 2 and there are 2 patches but one dress.  Now I will need to order another one for the 2nd twin
2.0,"Was too small and the color came in beige.  Nice coat, but not what I was expecting."
2.0,"I like the dress pattern, with the semi flared skirt, but it was not wide enough.  And I hate the material.  I would have loved this in a cotton."
2.0,They are see through and there was a run from the ankle up the back.
2.0,"Fabric is stiff, size is way too small. Bought for my husband and my 5 year old put them on, they fit her better than him."
2.0,return<br />I returned this anklet.
2.0,"Pretty dissapointed with this shirt. Its alittle big on me but i havebig shoulders so i usually need to order up a size and this is where i am. But ive dealth with that all my life. What gets me is when they advertise a deep royal purple, but the shirt is a flat pastel light purple. The color is so off i couldnt get over it and im sending it back."
2.0,"It's not pretty. I have natural C cups and this bra turned them into the most unflattering things possible. Smashed, squeezed, with no shape or support."
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt look like the photos at all. Poor quality.
2.0,"These are so thin they don't hold straight unless they're hooked. Great clasp and very sparkly, I would only recommend these if you want something extremely dainty."
2.0,"The heading for this product uses the ""Oversized"" as a descriptor but they are definitely NOT oversized,  My wife and my glasses are not extremely big but these would not fit over our glasses; not by a long shot.  If you have extremely SMALL glasses then they might fit over your glasses but if you order; be prepared to send them back after you try them."
2.0,Dont like how wide the neck is. And the arms are too small.
2.0,I should have read the reviews closer as another buyer if the same shirt said the exact same thing... Definitely NOT Aeropostale brand. Shirt fits nice but not worth the $29 I paid
2.0,"after 2 washes the tee looked old and as if it was used multiple times, which is not the case"
2.0,in the description this shawl is supposed to be navy blue.  It is more of a peacock blue.  I bought it to wear with a navy gown.  I had to return it.  Absolutely NOT navy!!
2.0,Ok get what you pay for
2.0,it is not the same product I have ordered and that appears on pics.
2.0,"Bought these as a gift for my 9 year old, she loves them - however, they are the first earrings to ever break her ears out (and she does not have sensitivities to any metals) and they do not have backs to stop them to come out of the ears (after the curve, the rest if the earring is so short that they come right out without backs). So if you plan in purchasing these, get some clear stoppers so they do not fall out of your ears!"
2.0,"I like them. However, the cord on the first pair broke within two days. They sent a new pair and the cord only lasted about a week."
2.0,"Dress was ordered in a 5x due to nothing ever fitting as stated on Amazon...  Thankful I did or I wouldn't have had a dress for my son's wedding.  Wasn't a very pretty dress either, unfortunately.  They put it on a size 2 model and it looks great, but when you buy it in a size 5x it's not a good look!"
2.0,The dragon on these earrings are not as clear in person . In person they were not as impressive.
2.0,I ordered this because it‚Äôs was a blush pink. What showed up was coffee candy cr√®me. Very unflattering. I am 5‚Äô8‚Äù. The dress was hardly half way down my thing. Not like what is pictured at all. I give up on Amazon dresses. Last three dresses were a bait and switch.
2.0,"I love a nice small bag, and love a nice minimalist look.<br />This bag though, is very small and the PU leather is thick and clunky. It's not cute or small looking, but is just a dense black bag. Bulky looking comes to mind, which is weird for how very small the pockets are.<br />It's nice that it came with a nail clipper bonus, (okaaaay)... but not worth purchasing. Pass."
2.0,Seemed very small after washing.
2.0,Might work for some but not for me
2.0,"These fit great, and the price was right, but a year later I'm revising my review down to 2 stars. They lasted 1 swim season, with once-a-week use. So maybe 15 visits to the pool? They are now see-through along the seam in the back. (Oh man, I hope I didn't flash anyone last time I wore them.) For the price, that's not bad, but next time I'm going to pay a little more for something that will last longer so I don't have to be paranoid about my shorts disintegrating in the pool."
2.0,"I wore this dress for my babshower. It is thin so I had to wear a slip under it. The hem also came undone. It looked nice for the shower but I will not wear again. If you purchase this dress, know you may only get one wear out of it."
2.0,"Came with part of the band detached, but I was able to reattach it. Logo fell of the inside of the watch after two weeks. Watch itself seemed well made. It's too bad the logo and band were so cheap. Returned it after the logo fell off and started moving around inside the watch."
2.0,"The ears were very cute. But the description said ‚Äúwomen‚Äù, however the sizing was definitely for a child. Headband part was not large enough to stay securely on an adults head. Was not able to wear for our Disney trip."
2.0,"I wish I could return this, but I didn‚Äôt get to wear this until 4 weeks after receiving this. I tried it on and it wasn‚Äôt as comfortable as Adidas‚Äô massaging slides. Flip flop are stiff, not flexibility.<br /><br /> I ended up wearing these sporadically for about a week only before donating them since I missed the 30 days return window."
2.0,These are better than I thought they would be.
2.0,I ordered these and got black owls instead kind of upset they are cute tho just not what I ordered
2.0,"These lenses distort everything pretty severely so they're not wearable.  If anyone finds glasses like these that work well, please tell where I can buy them!"
2.0,Great fabric and looks amazing but they sent me a L instead of a M so it actually looks great on my fianc√© and not me.
2.0,The leather started cracking within a month after purchase. Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for.
2.0,they are cute but they do run very small
2.0,Cute dress however poorly made. My pockets are uneven one is longer than the other.
2.0,Nice material and fitted my curves. However pockets were closer to my rib cage than my hips. I laughed and returned immediately.
2.0,"The cord was kinda low quality, the actual hammer was rough and didnt look like the picture"
2.0,The sizing tag said that this shirt was an XL. What it is no larger than a medium. I loved everything about this shirt except the wrong sizing information. I gave it away to a friend with a daughter who wears a medium and am told it fit her daughter perfectly.
2.0,"Color was not as expected, a little too brassy"
2.0,I had 2 main problems with these: 1) They feel exactly like a sports penny and are very see through.  The white one is completely see through.  The others aren't as bad but have the same feel as a sports penny. 2) The ones I received were clearly worn and returned.  They smelled exactly like a locker room or a used laundry bag.  Could easily be fixed by washing it but I would expect the seller to catch this before repackaging and shipping it out again as a new product.<br /><br />The fit is perfect.  I've been trying to find the perfect workout clothes for weightlifting at the gym and these would have been perfect if the material were higher quality and less see-through.
2.0,Not for big Plus size legs. They‚Äôll just roll down. Had to avoid pulling them high. More of a calf/knee high
2.0,"Cheap, cheesy fabric.  Odd fit."
2.0,"This top is poorly made. The ruching on the bust are only strips that are folded over and stitched on one side. They are not even and do not lie flat. There is uneven spacing between the strips. On one side of the bust, the strips are closer together than the strips on the other side. Wearing the top only makes this problem more obvious. It only gets worse after washing. The entire top is very wrinkled and when the top is ironed, the material creases badly because it was poorly stitched. The material is soft and comfortable and does stretch. I like the style of this top but do not recommend it."
2.0,"While the colors and patterns are nice, the fabric is itchy/scratchy.<br /><br />As a protective face mask it is totally worthless. The fabric is like a sheer chiffon."
2.0,You get what you pay for! Not the best but will work.
2.0,This was way too large and baggy!
2.0,I returned this as I ordered a medium and I am 5'4&#34; 140 pounds and this was a tent for me.  It was too complicated so I just returned it.
2.0,"Love the shape and style. Large bag that is easy to carry. I bought the pink, unfortunately, it's actually a peach color so I did return it. I have bought a few purses from this company and they are always great handbags. They just missed the mark with the color description."
2.0,I ordered this a size too big and it was still to small it was constructed poorly.
2.0,I first loved this band but after having it for four months the side straps popped out. So now it's just one band. Pretty upset about this because I loved the stacked look of the band
2.0,The opening was too tight even though the size was correct. There was an inner sole that did not fit properly and was almost impossible to resinsert.
2.0,These do not fit. They are incredibly small and do not wear well at all.
2.0,It's cute and inexpensive but my 7 year old girl managed to scratch up the face after one day of school??  The soft plastic face sticks up a mm from the bezel and offers no protection.  It did survive a dip in the pool though.
2.0,Beautiful jumpsuit for a taller woman.
2.0,Order up at least two sizes!
2.0,Couldn't wait to get.Sizing is way off. I would literally need XXXXL and I'm a size 12/14
2.0,"Super cute, however the pattern wasnt centered and the top wasn't trimmed in the back. You could see where they were supposed to trim it. No hem or stitching either, just cut fabric."
2.0,"UNLIKE my other dresses by Zesica, this one does NOT have the Zesica tag in it!  That might explain why:<br /><br />The waist of this dress fits really strange.  First off, it bunches strange and makes my hips look wider than they are.  Then, it doesn't actually hit at my waist but just under my breasts.  Even though I am heavy I do have a defined waist, but this dress makes me look strangely boxy (SEE PHOTOS).<br /><br />The fabric is light and not see through.  It has 35% cotton.  The print is very bright red and pretty.  Those are the big ""pluses.""<br /><br />I am a size 16 and I bought the XXL.  At that size it fits, but the ""FIT"" looks terrible on me.  Not flattering at all.<br /><br />By the way:  you HAVE TO wear it shoulders-down.  It bunches up strangely if you try to wear it on your shoulders.  I was hoping I could wear it both ways but nope."
2.0,"I loved it, but it runs small. So I had to give it to my daughter."
2.0,"My husband's sunglasses arrived today and well, okay nothing special. They are lightweight but I'm not sure that's a plus. Just not the quality I was expecting for the price. They appear more like what I would find at a Walmart but at a much lower price than what I paid. The case also was nice but the zipper Is broke. Not impressed."
2.0,The top had a small tear when I received it and it's a bit too loose.
2.0,This dress seemed to run big. It‚Äôs longer than what the picture portrays
2.0,The jewel fell out within a week
2.0,"Meh, overpriced for what you get even tho it‚Äôs the cheapest thing I could find.  You can see your nipples thru it and it‚Äôs just poorly made. It worked for a beach day, which is all I bought it for...  but just really cheap"
2.0,"Broke first day so sad, it was very beautiful though"
2.0,Zipper broke two months into using it
2.0,Barely any support at all. I am using it for sleep. Perhaps I needed only a large. I bought the Xlarge.
2.0,Too big for me. XS fit Perfect for a Medium Size.
2.0,"I loved it but after 11 days of having it, it randomly broke while I was eating. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything to cause it to break, after a few days short of 2 weeks."
2.0,I don‚Äôt see the sign of the cloth.l think itsn‚Äôt new. Iam really disappointed
2.0,"These used to be great. Perfect size and priced well, wear one for a while until it stopped looking sparkly then throw it out and if you lose one no big deal because they are inexpensive. I‚Äôve been ordering these for a few years.<br /><br />But when I reordered a few month ago, the ball on the end of some of them was a little to big, made insertion and removal a little painful. But not all of them were like this so no big deal. Then I ordered them recently and the post is crazy long, there‚Äôs no ball on the end and they are crooked. The replacement box they sent is the same- too long, no ball, and crooked. Very disappointed. Not looking forward to having to find new nose rings, these used to be perfect."
2.0,The graphics are not as nice as on the pic they look cheap.
2.0,"Ordered L/XL for my 1X size and got lost in it. Returned.<br />It was soft on touch, but I have no way to know how it would stand to wear and tear. OTOH, my worst experience for wear and tear was with RL robe I got my husband for the Father's Day. Go figure ..."
2.0,Much shorter than shown and liner is shorter than lace by about 6 inches. I was planning on wearing this to our company Christmas party but I tried it on and it was so embarrassing. I knew it was horrid but wanted to see if someone else‚Äôs reaction was like mine... I walked out and my husband laughed at me. Definitely did not keep.<br />Seller accepted my return
2.0,I got a small (I‚Äôm normally a small) and I almost ordered a medium because China sizes normally run small. So glad i didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so big on me. I‚Äôm not sure even the x small would fit. It‚Äôs a really cute dress. Just wish it fit correctly
2.0,"These are MUCH bigger than I expected (the cover the whole earlobe) & actually broke off the earring posts before I could wear them even once. Super glue may save them, but I don't know if I'll wear them"
2.0,"Both my husband and I tried these glasses while driving.  Neither of us liked them.  For me, it just turned the white lights of car headlights into a yellow light."
2.0,"Doesn't fit comfortably over my nose, it really digs into the skin and falls down when I talk. It seems to be for someone with a really big head and really pointy face. Also, the main reason I bought it was to see if it would prevent my glasses from fogging up, it did not. Probably would work for someone, just not me."
2.0,I really wanted to love this shirt.  It is very see through and made small.  I would recommend sizing up.
2.0,"I bought the coated black color. Good quality and perfect amount of ‚Äúsheen‚Äù to not look truly leather. Unfortunately the chemical smell was so overpowering I couldn‚Äôt be in the same room with them! Aired them out a few days, smell was still awful. For reference I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 115 pounds-and size 23 fit well but not super tight in the butt (but I‚Äôm certainly lacking in that area)."
2.0,You get what u pay for
2.0,"This is not a bathing suit, more like a body suit. It snaps at the bottom and the snaps aren't secure! It would be really cute if it was a bathing suit."
2.0,"I originally ordered a US medium but it was ridiculously small.  So I sent it back and ordered a US large. (I normally wear a Medium / Fitted shirt from US suppliers).  The US Large is still quite tight but, if I order an even larger size still, I am sure the sleeves would be much too long.  In my travels in Asia, I have bought shirts in Japan and Thailand and had good success with the fit.  My advice here ... unless you truly have a very tall, narrow and skinny Asian build, do not buy this shirt."
2.0,I ordered and didn't check the material. I would say definitely check material before you buy
2.0,"Wanted to use the frames for my prescription, but my optician says there are no screws to open frames. Very poor quality,  but for 12. 95 hope to use for sunglasses"
2.0,its cute love the pockets but had to return for bigger size. Its somewhat small but mainly b/c I am a DD and therefore prefer a larger size .
2.0,Looks to cheap
2.0,The bracelet requires at least one more link. It is shorter than the one I previously purchased. Being shorter in length makes it more difficult to put on. Please advise.
2.0,"XL fit as expected through chest, waist, arms but it waaaay too long and nearly reach my knees."
2.0,"It is described as 27.5&#34; but is actually less than 25&#34;, which is too short to conveniently use.  Sent it back."
2.0,"The shirt looks super cool and it is comfortable but after one wash, it shrinks 2 sizes! Order up."
2.0,Est√°n bonita pero corren chica
2.0,I ordered a medium and large based on reviews and they were so tiny they barely fit past my knees! They are a really nice quality but size up 2 to 3 sizes. I had to return them.
2.0,Very cheap material. Shows every flaw on ya. I have attempted to wear it a couple times and just couldn‚Äôt leave the house. Not flattering. 160 pounds. 5‚Äô2. Ordered large. Fits true to size. Wear 14.
2.0,I really like the design but it is just too short for my daughter even though I bought a couple sizes up.
2.0,Sizes run big so I look frumpy in it. I got a large when I usually wear medium and it is too long and baggy. Not sure if I'll wear it or give it away.
2.0,It is hard to zip and hard to close. Look around for a better one. It is like a linoleum look too so not what I was expecting.
2.0,"I like the sun glass but, I did not get the complete bonus that I ordered. I did not get the cleaning kits that was advertise."
2.0,"The patch is so large, it makes the hat comically tall. The clasp is the cheap press in a hole plastic kind. The hat and patch are well made. Just poorly matched with the size of the patch. Would look fine if you were 7 foot tall. Holding the emblem in such high regard, I may be overly criticle. But was greatly disappointed."
2.0,Se da√±aron al d√≠a siguiente
2.0,"Style was very cute, but the dress is way too sheer. My nude underwear were clearly visible."
2.0,Cheap and stinks
2.0,Looks are deceiving. Had to give it to my 10 year old!
2.0,"The shirts are not consistently sized, and each one is a little larger or smaller than the other. The pack we ordered had three shirts, two of which developed holes after 1 wash/wear. I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
2.0,We ordered these for basketball they run small
2.0,Smelled disgusting and wasn't long enough to get a good hang off the shoulders.
2.0,"This looked so cute online and exactly what I wanted, but when it arrived I was so disappointed.  It was more like a keychain than a necklace.  In fact... .shorten the chain a bit and that's what you've got.  I've worn it only a couple of times and couldn't wait to take it off as soon as I got home.  It wasn't expensive, so I'm not all broken up over it, but I'd rather have kept my $15-ish dollars and bought something else that I might actually put to some use."
2.0,"Liked it initially but after about 2 wears, it faded something terrible! Won‚Äôt wear it again sadly"
2.0,Super cute on hanger but not cute on me. Love Amazon‚Äôs return policy. I‚Äôm not a very good online clothing shopper so I‚Äôm not too surprised it didn‚Äôt fit.
2.0,Completely Flat and will not bend to shape face. But it was only $5 so you get what you pay for.  Also took forever to receive.  I forgot I had ordered them it was so long.
2.0,it was not mentioned anywhere that this is only one earing. I got this but went waste.
2.0,"I couldn‚Äôt get my foot in the ankle opening, too small"
2.0,They're a bit too loose and don't hold the ponytail as well as they should.
2.0,Very cute shoes I ordered a 10 and had to give them to my sister who wears a 8.5
2.0,"Band too tight, slides up to hairline then pops off. If I pull band down it sits naturally on my eyebrows, then pinches my face, skin tight. No lining inside, cheap, not well made."
2.0,"The bracelet was cute but it wasnt what I ordered. I ordered it with a little moon on it and it didnt come with the moon, only some jewels that kind of look like stars maybe"
2.0,I wanted sleeveless t shirts;  the pictures show the arm holes high but they are typical tank tops not sleeveless t shirts.
2.0,"They are pretty tight fitting, the seams in the scrotal region have opened on 3 of the 4 pairs"
2.0,It runs small.  I would order one size larger than what you are.
2.0,Rose color has already worn off after wearing less than 5 times. Did not wear in shower.
2.0,Cute dress but was to big. Ended up returning.
2.0,"It was a nice vest but it was way too small.  I even bought a large to be cautious, when I'd usually get a medium,but it didn't fit."
2.0,"Not flattering, fabric is too thin and looks cheap. Runs small. Returned"
2.0,Great looking and fitting. Really cinches your waist for a flattering look without being tight. The Small has a lot of give and it fits me great. But the clasp is not strong enough. When you turn from the waist it will pop right off. A bit awkward when your belt ricochets and hits the floor. It's a conversation stopper.
2.0,All the seems pooped when I pulled it over my head. Lace is total crap.
2.0,Short was long enough but very baggy everywhere else and I‚Äôm a fit guy and it laid on me like a potato sack with holes for arms
2.0,Cheap. Broke in two days. üòî
2.0,It is a slick polyester material. The material almist immediately begins to pile.
2.0,"I got the sizing base on these reviews but they are way off. Order your true size. I‚Äôm usually a medium or large. Base on these reviews saying they fit big, I got a small and medium. Neither fit. Medium was tight."
2.0,"I'm a size 13, not wide. These are loose and not particularly comfortable even after a couple of washes. They will now be cleaning rags."
2.0,"These shoes are very wide at the toe and look a little odd.  I ordered a size 11, but they are made in china and came as a size 30."
2.0,I had no it a couple weeks... went to wear it...it looks like cheap brass....<br />So unhappy with purchase.
2.0,These are the same ones I always order for my snake bites and this time the posts were different way too long
2.0,"I was going for that baggy warm oversized sweater look but it was more like a stiff box shape, fabric is super thick and itchy, had a really bad smell, and the sleeves are way too short despite it being a size too big for me everywhere else, wouldn't recommend. The neckline isn't like that at all either, it's right at your throat"
2.0,Huge! Not child size at all.
2.0,The quality is not so great on these. Cheaply made and were slouchy in the leg. Unless you have super narrow feet I would size up a half size. Returning because they are too tight in the toe and not comfortable all around.
2.0,Huge and ugly.  I plan to take it apart and use the beads to make some other earrings.
2.0,Went to go wear a pair of these today- one of the hands was backwards. Then the angle that theyre on causes them to fall out of your ears constantly. So unless you're prepared to fix earrings that are brand new I'd suggest staying away from these.<br />The design itself was cute though ü§∑
2.0,"the quality of these pants are great , and are perfect for any tactical situation , but the legs are just to big ( i mean BIG )  ... i""m not a small man at 6""1"" / 225 , but the legs on these pants were just to large ... I had purchased another pair ( urban tactical) and they fit fine.."
2.0,Returned these. They were huge and looked cheap on.
2.0,"Quick service, but bracelet broke second time my daughter wore it. They replaced it, however the replacement broke, too! Not worth the money!"
2.0,The buyer is expected to punch his own holes. There are some holes but they are for a larger waist than 46...much larger. They provided the punch. I plan to cut it to proper length and punch it when I can get through the snow and cold to my workshop. Good material and good looks though.
2.0,I dislike this product because I have only had for 3 months and already broke. Yes I was gentle with them but still broke.
2.0,Stylish but doesnt follow time very accurately. Under closer inspection mostly looks and feels like a toy.<br />Tho it is waterproof and scratch-proof as it claims to be. I wouldnt get this watch again.
2.0,"Shorter than expected. Didn't like the quality of material used.<br />Looked very frumpy on me, I'm a US 6, 5'11""."
2.0,"Not crazy about it, but it was super cheap so I‚Äôll wear it over a bathing suit"
2.0,"It was as described, but cheap and gaudy to me.  I returned it."
2.0,"This shirt looks beautiful, and it's cute for going out. Style was, in the words of Amazon return, not as expected. Way to small, and very short! I'm a thicker girl. And I'm taller. In a perfect world, ideally, I like my shirts to reach the top of my thighs. This shirt did not. So I returned it. Love the look tho."
2.0,I really liked these and thought they were cute.  But after a month they broke.  I'm happy with them considering they came at such a low price.  I just wish they would've lasted longer :(
2.0,"smell was like chemicals out package, after washing it was super wrinkled and ends turned up. not very flattering after laundering to wear for first time."
2.0,"Work. Length and material is good. Just boxy, where the underarm area flares out. Uncomfortable fir me."
2.0,Fell apart after three days.
2.0,Too big  order size down
2.0,"Loved the look of this top on the model, but the fit was just odd on me. I'm 5'9"", a size 12. I bought an XL because of reviews saying the sleeves run small. The top was awkwardly long even though I'm tall and would've looked better about 4"" shorter. The sleeves were nice and long, but they fit weird around the armpit. A large probably would've fit me better in the torso, but then she sleeves would've been worse. Disappointing since I love many Patty Boutik styles, but I'm guessing none will fit me quite right. Will be returning."
2.0,"I had to send this back as a large,even though following reviews and chart, as the tatters make a short person look even shorter and if you have unwanted weight (as I do) even dumpier. A-lines much better. It was tight under the arms even though this is the stretchiest material in the world!  Just not my kind of thing I want to be wearing at my age.<br />Just to help reviewers  I am 158 lbs 5'2&#34;  shortwaisted (curses!)  40&#34; bust<br />  35&#34; waist<br />  41&#34; hip<br />Hope this helps someone else as the reviewers who give this kind of info are the best help of all.  Nice blouse, it fit well- doesn't really do much good folks!"
2.0,"Super cute and perfect for my tiny wrist, but the strap broke a month in. Not sure if I should just buy a new one, or just try and replace the strap..."
2.0,"Feel nice, but too small. I ordered 40D and they fit my daughter who is 38C. After only a couple of months the cups are indented and not holding their shape. There is also at least 1 that has an underwrite poking through already. I'd return them, but it's too late. :("
2.0,"This cap feels sturdy. It is similar to a typical baseball cap with a mesh back (for ventilation). The front of the cap is made of a fake leather that can be wiped clean. I LOVE the wide brim because it keeps the sun out of my eyes. The back is easily adjustable with the typical plastic snaps typical to most caps of this style. The color is a baby pink that is perfect for summer.<br /><br />However, I have one absolute HATE. There is a black asterisk embroidered on the back next to the strap along with the words &#34;about last night&#34; above the strap. I am not usually one to wear suggestive messages such as this and for this reason only, it is a two-star hat to me. I wish I had noticed this before I placed my order.  Other than this saying, it is a five-star cap (see front and back pictures attached)."
2.0,Fine for a knock off but as a 6ft tall size 14 woman it doesn‚Äôt even cover - not that it is too short.... but it only wraps around my armpit. Like a hotel towel that leaves nothing to the imagination.
2.0,Purchased for a CR-V‚Ä¶. But did not fit on our 2020 model. Otherwise it was nice!
2.0,Wide short shirt.  Disappointed
2.0,I purchased this dress several sizes big. This is a form fitting dress and it was not advertised that way.
2.0,Sizes are Definitely not right.
2.0,These look great. But the fall out very easily.
2.0,"This is beyond too small. I don't even have words! I'm not overweight, but I do have big fake boobies. I usually order a medium to a large. I ordered the biggest size- XXL and I couldn't even get it on!<br />There is no stretch to the shirt or the sleeves so there is no wriggle room. On a positive note: it came much faster than expected (about a week) the peach color is very pretty, and the style is darling. It's just not made for an American woman, or any woman with boobs for that matter!"
2.0,There‚Äôs nothing to use to connect to braclet
2.0,"The general styling concept on the legs is great, but these are astronomically high-waisted - like ridiculously. I have a LONG torso and these came up to my bra line."
2.0,"After taking off my pants and letting it drop to the floor, the buckle broke apart, and the piece that holds it together is so tiny it disappeared, leaving me with a broken belt. I then bought from another brand, forgot the name, not the exact same build, but similar enough, also metal, and it's withstood my carelessness so far."
2.0,"The back broke after only wearing a few times...you get what you pay for, I guess."
2.0,"I've had this watch for about 9 months now and overall I'm satisfied with it as a fashion accessory.  It has a great look with a large face and unique dials.  The band is great quality and my glass has not scratched.<br /><br />However, my watch looses about 5 minutes a day, and if I don't wear it for more than 3 or 4 days the automatic energy runs out and I have to wake it up and reset the time.<br /><br />This is the first automatic watch I have owned, so I cannot compare this behaviors with others."
2.0,Something was strange about the shape of the cap not fitting comfortably sort of lopsided construction.‚Äã
2.0,Doesn't fit 14mm too well. You have to force it a bit. It works but not the easiest to install since it's a bit wide for 14mm.
2.0,"Pretty disappointed with this purchase.  This wrap is very heavy, stiff around the top, and warm.  Maybe I will enjoy the warmth in the winter but it‚Äôs too much for summer time.  It is also completely unflattering on in my opinion."
2.0,This hat was too small and thin i did not like üëéüëé
2.0,"After wearing this for about a month, and after about three washings, it starting becoming thread bare. Not good quality. Also it's not as heavy as I was expecting. Not that warm."
2.0,It‚Äôs not shaped the way it is in the pictures and the material isnt flows like pictured it‚Äôs more stiff- but it‚Äôs still comfy and I still like it for my pregnancy- but definitely is not what‚Äôs in the picture and will just use it for doing house chores but still feel pretty
2.0,Doesnt fit well or look nice over the breast.
2.0,Super cute! Should of bought a size up. Very tight to get on and then they had no wiggle room near the toes.
2.0,The registration on the details is off so it looks cheep
2.0,"The item is baggy,but then again I bought it for the funny description üòÇ"
2.0,Fits extremely small
2.0,"These were cute but not very practical and seemed like they would break if used for any serious purpose.  Hard to know how to use/attach them, also."
2.0,Muy linda falda y de buen material
2.0,"It‚Äôs an average pair of earrings. There is no wow factor at all. If I had an easy way to return it , I would have done so as I am not based in the US!"
2.0,Wasn't exactly what I thought it would be
2.0,"Sad to find the written description of this item is not what it says,. This ""sweater"" is a crop top. Then material compared to normal sweaters and just an iron on design. Pretty sure my 10 yr old could have just made this lol"
2.0,The top was way too small and the pads inside very small. Disappointed it doesn't fit better on top at a large size.
2.0,Fitting around waist was off but I like the silhouette.
2.0,Cute but the moon is not good tone.
2.0,"Not a winter coat as described. Very light, thin material. Will not keep you warm. May be suitable for fall, not winter. Also, the sizing is off. The coat was wide, but the sleeves were very short. The sleeves went just passed my elbow. I will never wear it. The seller also did not let me return it."
2.0,"It's a pretty skinny chain, of course, it is hard to tell will photos.  I assume it's 10k, otherwise that would be fraud.  But the chain is really pretty!, just thin.  If you don't live in a house, you'll have trouble getting USPS to deliver, USPS will not try to do anything but drop it, I live in an apt and they didn't have enough sense to drop with the main office, as all the other carriers do if I am not home."
2.0,Failed to stay tight after 4 months.
2.0,The length was perfect but the waist was way too big. üíî
2.0,"for buying it to be a 3x, but it was more like a lg- xl"
2.0,The quality not good it‚Äôs not a one size fits all either if your really small this will work if your thick/plus size you won‚Äôt be able to close it
2.0,"Light was messed up, can't see the face in the dark."
2.0,"Let me start by saying that I am definitely a ""petite"" in height and otherwise a normal body weight (size 4), not skinny, not fat. So the small fit me, ""width-wise"" just fine. However, both the top and shorts were way too short, which puzzled me because I am short. The top barely reached the top of the shorts, which in turn tended to slide up my waist and leave my legs almost entirely uncovered. I had to return this one and continue the search for cute and comfortable PJ shorts with LS top."
2.0,The XTS  logo fell off within a week of getting it. My husband super glued it back on. The keychain itself looks very nice and is good weight.  We did not contact the seller to correct it.
2.0,The belt it cut short and doesn‚Äôt fit.
2.0,Do not put ice in it. It will not work.... It half way turns on. I want my money back.
2.0,"These shoes matched my dress perfectly - down to the crystal broach.  They were a little higher than I like, but they seemed okay at home - I even walked around in them a little a couple of times to wear them in.  They are very cute, but... I took them on a cruise for formal night, and didn't like them at all.  The straps kept falling off my heal and they were not comfortable even having not worn them very long that night.  I think I ended up leaving them on the ship.  No reason to bring them home, I wouldn't have worn them again anyway."
2.0,Has a toy feeling to it.<br />I wouldn't consider this jewelry.
2.0,one of the rivets came out the 2nd time i wore it.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:59e095fe42a0c22585ed5ee24ba095c]] These are made so oddly. The fit is terrible. It creates that pointy torpedo boob shape. Very thin. The gap for the front closure is too wide. So the cups are all the way back in my arm pit but also were cutting into the middle of my chest. Totally uneven. Not good at all.
2.0,It is very small.  Too small for an adult.  Maybe I should have read the dimensions.  I assume they are posted.
2.0,Im not crazy about these. There are these two weird seams that go up the middle and the back that make them look like weird winter underwear. Also the outside material is this super fragile nylon like material. It snags and tears super easily. Instead of wearing these for my intended purpose of warm leggings I wear them under my jeans on super cold days. :(
2.0,Not wide enough.
2.0,"I ordered a M, and the dress fit perfectly in the bust and the straps. But the satin ribbon has NO GIVE whatsoever. The zipper was extremely hard to even normally zip through that area, and while it did end up zipping and fit, as soon as I turned or bent over, the zipper right at that satin ribbon split. Ended up having to spend more money to replace the zipper and add fabric to just the satin ribbon part of the dress."
2.0,"I liked the fit on my body. But shirt wasn't long enough, 2xl"
2.0,Shoulders fit okay but from the waist down the shirt was to small.  Tapered in to much.
2.0,"One of the clips isn't tight enough so it keeps coming undone. It also pinches my skin.<br /><br />It's not a terrible, but I sure wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"The tights are really nice, the fabric, and they way they looked on me...<br />Buuuut, and there's a HUGE BUT!<br />The bad thing is the belt per se...<br />Because it was broken in the part where you spouse to close...<br />The fabric is broken and the piece is missing..."
2.0,Broke after 1 day of wearing sunglasses ear pad coverup fell off. Not high quality.
2.0,"Disappointed. Nice designs but Very cheap quality, there‚Äôs only image on one side of the earrings. Looks like they were made from 3D print machines."
2.0,Holy moly does this run small. I am a normal L or XL in a T-shirt and the XL fits like a small. No joke this shirt is tiny!
2.0,"This might fit a child, but certainly not an adult"
2.0,Definitely for a one time use.
2.0,"Crap, not a real t-shirt it made of some kind of super weak paper like cloth pure garbage"
2.0,Was hoping for better quality.  Lager than expected. Order size s.aller when ordering
2.0,The top of the key chain broke off within one month.  Returning for full refund if still available!
2.0,"These booties run small and narrow.  I normally wear a medium width and these are too tight, now stuck with boots I can't wear. The color is more faded or distressed than the picture shows."
2.0,Much shorter than pictured both the dress itself & the ‚Äòwings‚Äô
2.0,It has a wierd fit in the arms and is a little small. I am also not a fan of the material.
2.0,"Cute enough, but super thin material and TINY."
2.0,"I started wearing on 12/08 and removed it today, 12/10. The first day was fine but on day 2, it started to become more and more sore and pink throughout the day. I removed it as soon as I got up on day 3 and it was so red and painful. Removal caused some bleeding but that could have been more me than the product as this was my 1st time removing a clasped nose ring. The edge of the ring is slightly rough, where the stones are, so it did catch a couple times on certain fabrics (like pillows/blankets). It's really pretty and fit nicely on my nose but I don't think the material is as stated. My nose and ears are really sensitive to garbage metals and infection happens every time."
2.0,"Although the style of the dress was really cute, the material was very thin and you could see through it. The color is also not as vivid as in the picture."
2.0,"Upon opening the bag, the feather starting flying everywhere! I had to take it outside and have the kid try on outside the house. And then I put everything in a trash bag and stored securely until Halloween‚Ä¶"
2.0,The colors were faded and the size delivered was wrong.
2.0,If you look at the earrings you can see they are the same earring that is made into a mirror image.  So they won't hang like the picture.  That is a sign of cheap to me so I passed on the purchase
2.0,Really small & gave me an infection. Cute but would not recommend.
2.0,...material.
2.0,the numbers only work periodically
2.0,"I purchased these as a gift to match a necklace.  The earring on the right in the picture is not centered, showing most of the setting edge.  This also leads me to believe that it would not be secure very long.  This is a large pearl so it is very obvious. I will keep them for myself but they are not suitable for a gift.  With just 4 days till Christmas Eve I will shop locally so that I can see the product."
2.0,This one tore the second day I wore it
2.0,Dress runs large !
2.0,"After the first wash, the thread came completely out."
2.0,It's a very nice blouse. Better for warm weather or warm places. Hangs a little wide on the shoulders around the neck so if you don't like showing your neck off then you may not like this one.
2.0,When my husband wore it 2 months the band broke off. He really like the watch.
2.0,straight leg from hip to cuff creating an odd leg shape that is most unflattering
2.0,"Very thin fabric, see through"
2.0,"I loved these for my son, but they got a huge hole in the toe after pretty minimal wear."
2.0,"I can't believe it!  This item is listed as a ""sweatshirt robe"".  It is a long, thin T-shirt!  It is NOT a large fit, it is on the small side.  I wear a size 4 and ordered a Medium.  I consider it to be a scant medium.  This is the second Amazon clothing item I have ordered, and am thoroughly disappointed in both.  The long-sleeved t-shirts I ordered (size Med) are gigantic!  I cannot possibly wear them.  I love ya, Amazon, but just forget getting into the clothing business.  It is going to hurt your reputation."
2.0,"The top is good, bottom way too skimpy - barely covers your parts in front"
2.0,Pockets are floppy and stuck out. Skirt is not flattering for someone with an hour glass figure.
2.0,This dress is very cute and flattering but a section of the zipper was not sewn. I was able to fix but it was an annoyance as I was ready to leave the house in it.
2.0,Didn't care for the texture of the fabric inside the hoodie.
2.0,Too tight on upper arm.  Cuts off circulation and my arms arent huge. Not plus size.
2.0,Too tight! Not true to size at all. The band rolls down and the legs roll up. They only get two stars because the fabric is soft
2.0,"Was extremely disappointed to see that there was no opening allowed to pee!  You push, pull and get this on it's sleek and helps the bulges but to urinate you have to remove whole garment and it had a high waste!"
2.0,Product was cheaply made. Wrist straps buckle broke in the first few weeks of having the product. You get what you paid for. Product is cute and wallet part is still holding together.
2.0,Mock neck extremely tight. Not at all comfortable and felt extremely disproportionate. Stretchy but thin material.
2.0,"I think the style as nice.  It fits well and true to size.  Sadly, I am returning it.  I purchased it specifically because of this information the seller had provided in the customer question area: ""what is the fabric content?<br />Answer: the bed jacket is made of 35% Polyester, 65% Cotton,lightweight but warm ,the robe is great for winter<br />By Ekouaer SELLER  on November 1, 2018"".  Sadly, the label in this item specifies ""98% polyester/ 2% cotton"" !  It reminds me of a polar fleece airline blanket.  It didn't seem like a breathable fabric, and after laundering it clung to other fabrics--static."
2.0,They are way to small I will have to return them although they are pretty
2.0,"Cool, for sure. Not really that confortable on the nose or ears... but what took the cake was 2 clear cracks on each side of the glasses. I am affraid they wil break very soon, I am returning them within a week.<br />Maybe this was a faulty pair... but even w/o the cracks I was on the verge of returning them just because they are not really that confortable, they look good though..."
2.0,"You get what you pay for... falls off constantly. Even if the tabs do click into place, they unclip and the band falls off. Almost lost my watch out of the car window because of it. Spend a couple bucks more and get a better quality band..."
2.0,"We probably should have read more reviews, but the fabric was not what we expected. Slick, Shiny, Synthetic... Thick and hot... Would not recommend or order again."
2.0,"Bought these to go camping and teach my kids to use a compass. Nope. A big bubble inside the glass prevents the compass from freely moving around. Even when we wiggled and bumped and spun it, the two would have different readings from each other.  The two stars are for the paracord and whistle. Very loud."
2.0,"OK I really wanted to love this, but I returned it. For reference I'm 5'4, 105, with zero chest so this really fits me like a bag. It's a gorgeous color pink, but too short, and didnt fit well on me. Too bad because I loved the picture."
2.0,"Overall the shorts function, but the two belt loops on the front with none around the side or the back? What is the purpose of this? Looks? Loops to hook lightweight gear? I assumed you could wear a belt with these but that is not the case.  Also, the underwear legs are shorter than the image. They are cropped right at the edge of the padding which means they ride up into your crotch after riding for a while.<br /><br />If you are OK with no belt, and avoid ordering the with the padded underwear, the shorts are fine.  But the advertising is not really accurate."
2.0,These fell apart out of the box. Not worth the money.
2.0,"The material is kind of weird...thin and stiff. There is no give to the material.  It is a dress, but it is short.  It is tight across the chest. I don't love it.  I wanted to love it. The only thing I like is that the sleeves were long enough.  I read the reviews before buying, but i am very disappointed."
2.0,Order 4 Among Us Bday shirt. In 3months was 3x (per-tag/hung dry) already noticed peeling of logo I CANNOT reach out 2 seller bc product now unavailable.  When I pay $18. for tshirt I expect MORE wear n tear!! Wtf
2.0,"Nice fabric & colors but too big on the hips for me, Had to return it."
2.0,"These looked soo good, but they were very tight. I guess try to order a size it 2 up"
2.0,"From the picture I thought the design was going to be brown leaped print, but it was actually a pretty bright orange and the design looked like a cheap iron on design"
2.0,Nice shirt but not made for large breasted women.
2.0,"bought few for my friend's bridesmaids, its pretty but bad quality, one broke on the same day"
2.0,"I bought the blue cardigan with red and white stripes.  It's a really nice looking sweater, but the problem is the material.  It's the most horrible acrylic and the only word I can think of to describe the feel of the fabric is ""abrasive"" next to the skin or even to touch.  I've owned lots of acrylic sweaters and they don't need to be like this.  Unfortunately, it's going back."
2.0,Not worth your money. They feel cheap and don't really work that well. I bought them for night driving and rain driving.
2.0,The sizing was ok. I ordered a medium and I am 5‚Äô4 138 lbs.  However it is much thinner than some of the dresses that I‚Äôve ordered on Amazon similar to this.  You need to wear leggings with it. It is see through otherwise.
2.0,Very cute but the top runs small and tge bottoms are riduculously small
2.0,The waist band in the bottoms is twisting up. That was at the first wearing. Won't order again.
2.0,"**update: used it at the gym, it was super tight when I started sweating, hard to get off to drink some water, and it wasn‚Äôt good for excessive breathing on the treadmill. 2/5 stars now.<br /><br />‚Äî‚Äî<br /><br />4 stars because It is a bit big on me, but I also have a small face and a wide, flat nose. However, it being adjustable made it so that it wasn‚Äôt HANGING off my face like a lot of masks do.<br /><br />It‚Äôs comfy, breathable, and has a sleek look to it.<br /><br />It‚Äôs still a big large on my face even when it‚Äôs all the way tight , but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs that the mask is large or my face is small.<br /><br />I‚Äôve yet I try it at the gym, but I don‚Äôt doubt it‚Äôll be just fine.<br />Came with two, which was also pretty rad.<br /><br />Overall great product."
2.0,"Fit and quality is good, would've rated 5 stars but the ring I received had no wood grain and that's what I purchased for. Somewhat disappointed"
2.0,These bend very easily. When trying to put one in the first time I accidentally bent it a little and now they won't snap. So I only have 1 wearable pair from this purchase. Very cute though.
2.0,"I ordered XXL, when this shirt arrived it was XXL in CN size, XL in EU size and L in US size.  To my eye it looked more like a Medium in US size.  Quality of materials and stitching appears to be good.  This is FITTED type of training shirt.  I live in the US, and ordered an XXL and got a US L, which was waaaaay too small for me.  I wish that was posted here, now I have to take the time and energy to return this and look for another option. See photo of label of what I ordered and how their tag reads.  Hope this helps with ordering the correct size."
2.0,I ordered a large and it fits like a sports bra. Not tank top sized at all. I am pulled out out and out looked like a small child's shirt. I stretched it over my boobs and it looks like a sports bra. Barley covers my 36DD'S. made for youth sizing.
2.0,"For the money, I was not supposing I would see such issue...the right pad is much thicker than the left pad...feels comfortable but cannot ignore the difference between my hands..."
2.0,I expected this to be similar to other 3d print shirts but was disappointed to see that the picture looks pretty blurry in person. At least it feels nice to wear.
2.0,This sweater is HOT! Not necessarily because of the cute low cut top... temperature wise! I live in California and it is never cold enough to wear it.<br /><br />It also ran smaller than anticipated. Wish I had gotten a size larger.
2.0,I am actually really disappointed in the quality.  The plastic is worse than 3D theater glasses . The lenses are flimsy and could easily pop out. I was excited for the hearts kind.. they don't even work. The traily kind works good. I like that pair. But the quality really fell short this time. :(
2.0,Cheap and very short....didn't fit st allQQ
2.0,Not very complimentary to my body type. I'm 5'4.5&#34; and 140 lbs - very muscular. It made me look 'fat'
2.0,My charms fell off several times even after clamping the jump ring tight until one day I didn't have any charms on my key ring at all. That only took 2 months. Very cheap
2.0,"A size s<br />6 was the right length for my skinny son who is only 4 years old, but it‚Äôs extremely tight. It hurts him to put his arms into the sleeves. The quality is great unfortunately. It just hurts him to squeeze into it.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it‚Äôs great material. It‚Äôs just too tight for even a skinny child."
2.0,Cool feature but sole is so stiff you can't walk in them
2.0,the pants were  too long-over my shoes.The material was rough and the hips were too big.  I sent it back.
2.0,"The solid bands were great, but the ones with paint only lasted a few days. So plan on tossing the gold and silver.  Just wear the solid colors."
2.0,"Does not look like the picture at all. The part that wraps around your ribs is super loose and the product is very cheaply made. The bottoms are so large, they look like a diaper when you put them on. Ordered a medium for someone 5'9&#34; and 135 pounds. Terrible sizing. Do not recommend."
2.0,They are cheap and just that I have 2 left each lastest maybe 24 hours they would snap either putting on or after walking so long. Needless to say you get what you pay for.
2.0,"They feel good. I bought the xl navy. They run a bit smaller than expected and the crotch seems split the first day! They weren't too tight, just more snug than I had wanted, I bought a bigger size for the extra room."
2.0,Cute style. Very small
2.0,"I have a GT Air 2, my boyfriend got the new Spider so I got this so we could still talk. Both are Sena and the mesh still only works about 1/4-1/3 of the time. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating, the app doesn‚Äôt show any device on my phone so there‚Äôs no way to control or troubleshoot (firmware is up to date) and his app just crashes any time you press a button. When we do connect we can‚Äôt use music or the mics won‚Äôt pick up your voice.<br /><br />Nothing more infuriating than being on a ride and suddenly the mesh is no longer even synched to my helmet for no reason at all.<br /><br />Sena has almost no content out there on what to do if their steps don‚Äôt work - and they don‚Äôt."
2.0,"These rings were really fun! They are very wide so they didn't really look realistic and the only place they can sit is pretty far up on the nose. Despite this, they still looked fairly realistic. The magnet is good strength but that also means that it can get pretty uncomfortable. The sides also get sort of lopsided, and since it is two pieces of metal as opposed to one (like a real piercing), when it does get lopsided it is pretty obvious it is fake. The other thing is that the balls and spikes are near impossible to interchange which gets very frustrating. The rings are also slightly different sizes from each other based on color."
2.0,I was so disappointed because I had a whole outfit planned and when I got ready to try the shoe it couldn‚Äôt even zip pass my calf. I even tried a tiktok hack the make the boot stretch and nothing. Stay away if you have large calfs.
2.0,The length was too short.
2.0,"i am quite tall (5'-10"") with a longer torso than most. I love wearing cotton dresses, but what was clearly supposed to be the waistline of this dress was right underneath my boobs since this dress is clearly meant for shorter/average height women. Its a cute dress on a hanger, but the proportions were nowhere near what I needed them to be for my height."
2.0,I didn't like this dress.
2.0,The robe Was very big not true to size at all the hat was too small. It was a waste of money.
2.0,"The necklaces are so tiny and the clasps were very very difficult to use, especially the shortest one. They look very cute once put on and they are very dainty, if you are into such things. I suspect they are easy to break. The pictures somehow make you think they are bigger than real life. But they do look very nice and it's a nice design."
2.0,estos corren super grande
2.0,"Didn‚Äôt like the fabric texture, looked more like a nightgown type of fabric. The cut didn‚Äôt help either."
2.0,"Fits too big around hips, looked unflattering...also the top (bra) panels looked odd....had to return it. Sadly from side the dress looked cute...."
2.0,"I loved the fabric, but the top was too small and the bottoms too big."
2.0,The dress is cute and well made but way too small for me... my daughter was happy with it though
2.0,"Ordered an xl in hopes of it being somewhat baggy, fits more like a medium."
2.0,length of dupatta is small as compared to regular dupatta.price is little high for this product.
2.0,Watch band lasted for all of four days before the end pulled out of the clasp. I managed to jam it back in and pinch the metal down on the end to hold it. I‚Äôll see how long that holds.
2.0,Didn't like the fit of these pants at all. I even bought a size smaller then I thought I needed
2.0,Zipper came off on second day!
2.0,$88 for Nike hat come on man way too much it was a rip I like the hat but not $88 worth thank you
2.0,My great grand daughter loved them.
2.0,Cute but charms fell off unfortunately
2.0,Solo lo compre par Hallowen pero se cae de la cabeza porque no tiene profundidad
2.0,Coached pee wee flag football. These cheaply made belts deteriorate under the intense pressure of 6 year olds so... choose wisely
2.0,I do not know what happened with these pants. They were about a mile long and super tight. Sizing is off quite a bit. But they were soft!
2.0,The color was pretty and I love the style but the quality wasn‚Äôt good. The clasp was a magnet that would not close. The clamps on the strap felt like they were plastic and not metal. I didn‚Äôt care for it.
2.0,Fell apart after 3 months bought both colors and both broke.
2.0,"Cute suit, but I purchased this for my 7 year-old granddaughter and she loved it, but when she bends over, the bottoms are completely see-through.  Obviously, she can't wear it, so this was a waste of money!"
2.0,Runs very small on n us size chart
2.0,The toes are way too small to put toes in toe slots. Length of sock is fine.
2.0,"I am a size 8 and after reading the reviews saying it runs small, I ordered a XL<br />I should have ordered a XXL<br />The suit fits my torso, but the boob area is too small.  I am a 38C and the girls keep coming out from the bottom"
2.0,"The tops fits well, but the bottoms are huge!  I'll order separate items next time."
2.0,The only accessory that fit me was the necklace. It's terribly small
2.0,Already ordered a different band after only a month or so.  I‚Äôm constantly trying to tighten it to just come loose again after a few mins
2.0,"Not waterproof at all, my kids gloves became very wet and hands were cold when in the snow."
2.0,"Several of these bags were broken upon arrival. The strings weren't connected inside the bag so they wouldn't sinch closed. Cheap, but you get what you pay for. Should have juat ordered the Oakley one for $10."
2.0,"I brought 8yrs size for 6years old still its too small, the sleves are not even 3/4th of her hand."
2.0,"I‚Äôm petite, and the small size was way too big. Loved the color and style, but it looked like I had big empty pockets hanging inside out on the hips. Just sat really weird. I just wasn‚Äôt willing to invest in all of those alterations to hem it and re-do the seams so it laid better on the hips.  Very pretty, though. Wanted it to be ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù"
2.0,"The fit is small. It feels like a junior size. I also missed that it is ribbed. It does seem like it is made well. If it was bigger, especially in the arms, it would be a much better shirt."
2.0,It fits perfect around my waste but so large and long on the booty. The contouring is so low. I got a Medium. I should‚Äôve gotten a Small
2.0,"Wallet did not work for me, it is very durable and looks very nice, holds a lot of cards, but the little tab that you pull to make the cards easy access did not retract on the one I received, I may have just got a defective one, seller was very responsive and corrected this for me"
2.0,Same problem that everyone else said. I ordered them for work and I am constantly pulling them up so that I am not sagging. Other than that they are very cute and fabric soft
2.0,Thin slinky material runs small . Dress is tight fitting and rides up. Too low cut v neck.  I will use it as a top with a clammy underneath.
2.0,"Shorts are very well made. Finish is excellent. Liner is comfortable. Pockets are everything I want.<br />DISTRUST size on Amazon website.2XL and 3XL are considerably smaller than XL from US discount chains Target, Walmart, Kmart. I would have a drawer full of these shorts if the size was correct."
2.0,"To start off, the socks are terrible. They have the toe pocket and beside that they are rectangles, despite the sewing making you unable to reach the ends. The window was too high and the fabric above is quite tight, but they may just be a personal issue. Skirt is thin and almost see through. There was also the random strand of extra fabric on the undershirt. The pocket is just a stripe of ribbon not even fully sewn on."
2.0,So sad this dress was so short because the lace is so cute üòï
2.0,They are really of bad quality.
2.0,This is tiny and made with very cheap fabric - no surprise but still...
2.0,I LOVE cateye glasses. But I didn't realize this style is more North/South versus East/West. Not too happy with the purchase
2.0,When I got it there were loose strings so the jacket has holes in it and I just got it today. Runs small so definitely order a bigger size!
2.0,"I'd definitely size up on these, and be aware that you may need to wash a couple of times and they're not tag-less as we're accustomed to in the states.  These came from Europe, so they are sized a bit differently than what one would expect.  They are not in a retail package nor are they a size you would typically see in the states.  I kind of wish I could return and buy a different size as my arms are a tad big to get in arm hole.  I love the concept but do have concerns with the length and washing.  I normally wear a medium/ large - ordered large for a bit of extra room and to allow for copious amounts of washing.  Should have gotten XL.  Fabrics are not as soft as US FTL products."
2.0,My clear strap was filthy and clearly had been used. Grime and fingerprints. I returned it.
2.0,This ran smaller than the size.
2.0,"Se que no me ba a servir. Segun ustedes me iban a dar el 60% menos por el vestido y ustedes me devolvieron $16.79 , el vestido costo $34.97 - el 60% me hacen $20.98 de devolucion y ustedes despues lo cambiaron a un 20%menos y yo no estaba de acuerdo cuando yo le escribi les dije que ustedes me ofrecieron el 60% , y no me cuadra la devolucion. Gracias atten. Myrna Lois"
2.0,Smaller than expected. Poor quality
2.0,Tote bag received was not what was shown in picture. Dull colors with Yoda. Not as pictured. Disappointed!
2.0,"I bought this watch because it was super cute and ""waterproof"". Unfortunately, it is not waterproof. This was just after splashing around a creek and not even submerging the watch. So, I am returning the watch."
2.0,Very light green not vibrant as shown. Kind of dissapointed.
2.0,Fits very large. Get your size. Do not size up I would even size down.
2.0,I'm giving this 2 stars because the part of the bracelet that would make it smaller or bigger came off within a few days. I'm still able to wear it if I tie it. But it unties during the day & I have to keep tying it. It gets annoying. It was pricey I thought it was going to last me longer.
2.0,"the description for the 40L bag is not accurate.  The description says ""The inner removable pocket can store your phone, keys, money, keeping them dry"" and one of the reasons I got this (in the past I got the smaller one and it had this inner pocket, but this one does not)  It does not even have the velcro inside.  That is how I know it wasn't just missing from the shipment - just not included at all.  Disappointed this dry bad was not as described."
2.0,"I bought these pants a while ago and loved them, they were comfortable, in a great material, and fit perfectly.  I went to buy the same ones in a few different colors later on and got a completely different product delivered.  The new ""wrinkle free"" material wrinkles, the old product did not.  They are no where near as comfortable and don't fit the same.  Very Disappointing."
2.0,"It was scratched,  and took forever to get here."
2.0,Way too hot and thick . Good for cold states not Florida . Nice colors but material is like a hot nylon legging for the gym . Too long can be worn as short dress or short . No thanks .<br />Returning
2.0,"These turtle necks are very soft, but made very small. Would suggest at least a size larger than normal."
2.0,"The fabric on the one shoe doesn't stay/hold onto the back of my heel. Every step I take it slips off my foot. It's comfortable, but is suggest ordering a half size smaller than you usually wear."
2.0,Art works awesome but quality is very cheap can't even wear it
2.0,"While the wallet is very soft and provides the pockets I was looking for, it has a very bad smell to it, more over-powering than any leather wallet I have ever owned.  Because of the smell I would not be able to use it."
2.0,Not as shiny and pretty as pictured. The galaxy image didn't hang right and crossed over with the moon and looked silly. Snipped that part off and kept the crescent moon
2.0,very small but are very pretty
2.0,Scratches the roof of your mouth
2.0,I knew that these would be cheap but I didn't think they would be as cheap as they actually are. The material is like one of a tarp. Cute style but horrible execution. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"Should have ordered a size down. I‚Äôm a small but these were like large, they did shrink up some in the wash though."
2.0,"I love the colors, we loved the colors, I found the face of the watch was a bit on the small side and did not reflect the true picture as shown on the site."
2.0,"I was expecting a larger product, I guess I will have to continue my search. I'll find some use for them."
2.0,"I bought three caps. One black, one gray, and one with the blue polka dots. All of them are not the same size at all. The black and gray ones are too small and don't cover my hair fully. THe blue polka dot one is okay. They all get really wrinkly even if I take them out as soon as they're done drying. There's better scrub caps on Amazon that are cheaper and family made."
2.0,Smaller than what I expected I'm not wearing it. Also the beige color looks yellow.
2.0,"Este producto no lo recomiendo, no se vez ni parecido a la fotograf√≠a, adema de ser tan pobre c√°lida , llego en un peque√±o pl√°stico y roto ,"
2.0,"Center stone fell out on the first day I had it, but was beautiful ring"
2.0,The sleeves are about 2 inches too short (I do not have overly long arms by any means) and the section where the arm meets the shirt is gigantic. Disappointing considering the rest of the shirt was great.
2.0,"The material is just thin and cheap feeling. It came in a vacuumed sealed bag so all the teeth are bent and crushed- that might go away when you wash it, but I‚Äôm returning for a better made product."
2.0,the shape is weird and is larger than I expected
2.0,"While opening the box it was impossible to ignore the lint on the band. I got it to pair once but after my phone died it hasn't paired a single time since. The extremely limited information on the pavlok 2's led error/signal codes has been frustrating. There isn't any info on the error codes mine has been throwing. It hasn't behaved as any troubleshooting process states it should. It is as if pavlok has intentionally limited available information for addressing and troubleshooting problems. Their app is overwhelmingly annoying and I'd take an MSDOS layout over having to log in to some stupid service pretending to be more than it is. People pay enough for your little metal Starburst with a capacitor, give us some free reign in using it. You're not Apple we don't need a walled garden, we need it to actually work and not get hung up on whimsical tacked on trash. Conceptually, I love it, the moment where it worked, I liked it. With all the layers of difficulty somehow forced into basic operation of a device about as complicated as a paperclip I'm astonished by the failure to limit the scope and focus on functionality. Also the single button, the 1 button on it, is difficult to trigger and aggravation incarnate when you want to factory reset instead of shock yourself raw in the process."
2.0,Very comfortable and sized well. The Jordan logo washed off after the 1st wash so we basically bought gray pants.
2.0,Very unflattering. Totally shapeless.
2.0,so much smaller than I expected. get it at least a size larger cause otherwise it will definitely not protect your things.
2.0,NOT! sting proof as advertised
2.0,"It was very pretty but 4x was too small, I usually wear 2x."
2.0,Cute dress. And I knew by the price it would not be the best quality- and also by the reviews that it would run small . I ordered a large and it barely fit as a size 6. I reordered an XL. It came with an XL tag but fit exactly the same as the large. Just a hassle. üòí How do I get my money back from China??üòÖ
2.0,"it is too narrow, hence the words are very difficult to read."
2.0,It has awesome design but got broken a week after Amazon return window ended. One small bar from 7 o‚Äôclock detached and fall into mechanism. So it works but may randomly stop any time and then run for some time and stop.<br />2 star for amazing design.
2.0,"Looks like a bathing suit to me and to four other people who commented ""are you wearing a bathing suit as a shirt?"""
2.0,I am 5'1 and 105lbs and this was a bit too large for me on the shoulders and the waist. I ordered a small :(
2.0,Items were vacuum sealed together which resulted in the white shirt being discolored by the red shirt.  Not worth the hassle of a return.
2.0,The sunglasses must be made for larger heads. They were quite wide and they also sat awkward on my nose. My husband didn't care for the fit either.
2.0,"Dress is fine, delivery was less than expected."
2.0,"Very odd fit, poor design. Maybe made for a taller person? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù tall, and it was too long, too big across the shoulders."
2.0,"Dress is not true to size , runs very small. Color is vibrant and style is cute on . Unfortunately I had to send it back."
2.0,"I am normally an XL but ordered a 3XL. The bottoms fit perfectly but the top was 3 sizes too small.  My body is proportional so the top should have been able to fit, really sucks that it didnt. I'll keep the bottoms and have to shop at the mall for a plain black top to match. Kinda a waste of money. Really cute tho. I would recommend for girls with small breasts, no larger than a C cup"
2.0,"pockets are bulky, style is odd."
2.0,"Too small and short for my teenager, had to return"
2.0,Very short. NOT FOR TALLER WOMEN!! I am 5'7 and this barely covered my bum if i stood perfectly still.
2.0,Design is nice but  sweatshirt is too thin
2.0,"The clogs are really cute and good price, but material feels too soft plus has a strong smell."
2.0,This had THREE seams in it...not two on each side with miss matched patterns...but THREE...one on each side and one down the middle in the back. no wonder it was so cheap! I won't buy this brand ever again!
2.0,"The top is cute, runs a little big. The bottoms fit very weird and were not flattering."
2.0,I ordered the maroon dress and I looked like I was wearing a sack lol the pockets stick out which isn‚Äôt flattering for the hips. I probably could have went down a size honestly. Seemed to run big hence looking like a sack in it. I returned it.
2.0,"The hole to pop the back end of the earring into is not big enough and poorly made. You'd have to put on a separate backing to get it to stay in, but then it ruins the appeal of the earring itself. I'm happy to have it, but not worth the money."
2.0,"Nice material and good weight but the arms were awkward looking. Not a flow into the bat wings, sort of too pronounced. Returning but liked the length and feel of it."
2.0,The look is great but the quality is terrible after the first day of used one of the rounds ends came out.
2.0,Not the kind of fabric i like
2.0,So cute but feathers fall out.
2.0,"was a little small, recommend going a size up"
2.0,Big and not cute. Even for a tee. Mine came in a ball all wrinkly. As if someone else returned it
2.0,"I bought this to wear for a Halloween party as cruella deville. I got so many compliments but it was dropping feathers as soon as it came out the packaging. While waiting in line to get in, I was told by strangers that I left a trail of feathers. At the end of the party I sat down for a few mins while waiting on friends to gather and when I got up there was a pile of feathers.<br /><br />Looks great and is super full upon arrival. Needs more work or better adhesive or whatever it is that holds it together."
2.0,"This is not a breathable fabric. It sucks into you face as you breathe in. The prints were exactly as pictured. The ear straps are adjustable so that was nice, but the fabric masks them unusable. Especially in the heat and humidity"
2.0,Nothing like on the picture
2.0,"These are very cute and they fit comfortably for my daughter. However, we ordered these in September and my daughter has probably worn them 10 times or less since then, and the handles have broken off both boots. Poor quality."
2.0,The gloves fit nicely but do not work well with the screens on iphones.  We have to still take the gloves off to use our phone which was the purpose of buying THESE gloves.
2.0,Not in all
2.0,Measurements wrong on sizing
2.0,"Like the product but is damaged, is missing a gummy thing for the nose. How can I do a return?"
2.0,"I bought this because it had great reviews (maybe that is why my expectations were as they were).<br />I was not impressed. The veil seems unevenly attached to the headband which makes it fall awkwardly. It is a lot thinner that it appears in the picture. All of that puff is 1 layer of veil, so it is not as full as it looks in the picture.<br />Also, I bought this for a child with sensory issues. I sought out one with a headband because she will wear a headband more easily than any clips or combs. Unfortunately, this headband is really small/tight. I tried it on my petite 3 year old when it arrived, and it was tight on her. If she did not have sensory issues, it would have probably worked, but it still would have been exceptionally snug (overly snug).<br />I ended up buying a wreath and a veil that attaches with a comb. Hopefully it arrives on time. I will hold this until I receive the other and then I will return this.<br />It was not as expected."
2.0,Thin material. Smaller than expected. Shrank even more when washed. Cute picture. Took weeks to get.
2.0,Ordered size that I normally wear but the fit was not flattering
2.0,"Perhaps it was Buzzfeed or some other Facebook page I follow who directed me to these as being the &#34;best&#34; sports bras ever. I guess it depends on what sport you're doing in them. Low impact sports? Sure! They'll keep your girls in place. Running a marathon? You'll be sorry if you wear one of these sports bras. I bought them for when I'm active at work, and I think they'll do for that, but I won't be able to wear them for much more aside from knockaround bras."
2.0,You can find this on shein for $7 I literally was too lazy to return but it‚Äôs okay kinda cute
2.0,The legging were too small and more like puffy sweat pants and not legging!!
2.0,"I would have left a better review had I not noticed the stitching is already coming apart. They fit very nice, feel very good. Quality felt alright until I noticed the issue. Very disappointing."
2.0,"very thin plastic, can rip easy if not careful, but it's a nice length and color, I hope it will last me for some time"
2.0,"The look is pure Curnunnos and great for a traditionalist Wiccan.  In actuality, half the jump rings are missing upon arrival and the remaining ones are of such soft metal that they open up and are lost quickly.  I had to replace ALL of them in order for the figure to be usable."
2.0,Material was scratchy and stiff. The neckline fit more like a boatneck which looks odd with shirts underneath
2.0,Cute skirt but made for tiny people; not normal sized American women.  I knew it would not fit as soon as I unpacked it - it looked to be child-sized.
2.0,I have only had this robe for 3 months and the zipper has already broke. I‚Äôm really bummed because otherwise I really liked it.
2.0,"The fabric is ok. The fit around the neck and shoulders is good. Except, it's short waisted. I'm only 5'4. I don't have that long of a torso. It's not a good buy."
2.0,"As far as the product goes,it was exactly true. The problem I'm having is that I wear my necklace ALL the time; bed, shower, you name it, and it has turned black. I have used jewelry cleaner once and it cleaned it up, but within a few days it's black again. The cleaner is not something I want to do all the time because of the harshness, but I guess if I have some place special to go to I will have to use it then. Not very happy with the &#34;sterling silver&#34; chain. I have other sterling silver things and never have this problem."
2.0,Deer decoration is not sequined; just an ugly iron-on print. Shirt does have pockets tho.
2.0,Nice necklace but clasp broke after about 3 weeks and because of the style necklace I'm unable to change it so I can't even wear the pendant.
2.0,"These are super cute, but they are super small. Impossible to put on. Tend to lose the ball that you are trying to put on. Also seems to not want to thread properly."
2.0,Fit like bikini even after sizing up. Ride up on my butt and no room in the front for your man parts!
2.0,"I‚Äôm not sure what this is made out of, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that it‚Äôs some sort of paper! I would be afraid of washing this at all, let alone in the washing machine! It‚Äôs nice looking, is sewn well, and the handles are great - unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt appear to be fabric."
2.0,"The rubber strip (arm cover that goes over your ear) fell off.  Okay, it's been 8 months and $25.00, but still."
2.0,"Really kind of poorly made, not at all anything I will use. I had hoped for a nice product that I wouldn't mind pulling out in public, but this isn't it!"
2.0,"Cute in theory,  but it is crushed and creased :("
2.0,To small is this a kids clothing line?
2.0,Beautiful pattern but  way too samall
2.0,Was too small for my daughter. Returned it
2.0,"the small part of the sleeve was way too tight, the fabric was not very nice. too expensive to return"
2.0,The post are screws and I can't get them thru the holes in my ears.  And God help if you the back is lost.  There is nota  replacement because they are screws.  Too bad because they're beautiful earrings.
2.0,"Okay this was a fail. Weird fit. Pockets way too, I don't even know, flat and in the front. The bottom part of the pants was too loose while the top part was too tight. The arms are too loose also and the cuffs are way shorter than in the picture. I bought a size up because I like my joggers to be loose, especially high waisted ones. Well if I would have bought my regular size L, then these would not even be high waist. The main problem is the pockets are way too centered, waist not high or loose enough. They definitely do not fit like the fit in the picture. The only positive is that the set is comfy but I cannot see myself wearing the set together and to be honest idk if I'm gonna keep it or just resell it. At least its not see through I guess."
2.0,Didn't like material or fit of this shirt.
2.0,"Sized too small.<br />Maybe either change to sizing or add 4X, 5X"
2.0,Um. The size is on point sure. They do look to have the old Marlboro looking logo embroidered into them. But my goodness! As soon as I took them out of the bag I smelled a wretched smell! Like fish! It was strong and off putting. Just really odd!
2.0,Button destroyed on dress right out the package. Dress is supposed to be completely white...it is off white in the waist.
2.0,"I typically wear a small or medium. Ordered the medium and it fits great. However, I probably won't be able to wear this dress because I washed it before wearing and the purple at the bottom bled in the wash and turned the white section pink. I tried using a stain treatment right away and rewashing, but it didn't help. Maybe with repeated washing, it will return to white. But the bottom purple color is more of a dull magenta at this point."
2.0,"This is my second time purchasing watches from this company/brand called North. It's a nice little watch. I can tell that this watch is durable, especially since I still have the first one that I got few years ago.<br /><br />I have this watch a few weeks now and sad to say , wore it once and it stopped working.  Disappointed!"
2.0,Their pretty was way smaller then what I ordered. I have a small nose and nostril and I couldn't get any of them in so it was worthless to me
2.0,"The shirt stays are only ideal for people whose thigh girth is the same as that of the shin. it does not follow the natural curvature of the leg, causing it to appear as though one is wearing a leg brace when wearing pants. Otherwise it's a good quality product."
2.0,I got a couple different belts on Amazon from different places trying to get a good leather belt like the one I‚Äôve had for years. This belt feels and smells like really cheap leather. It‚Äôs just a cheap belt made in China and way over priced.
2.0,"Bought this for a black tie wedding I'm going to in October and was super excited about it. I loved the idea of a little train in the back. Needless to say I got the dress, tried it on and the front came above my ankles. I'm only 5'5 and 105 pounds. It looked terrible. I returned it asap!"
2.0,"I got mine 7 months ago, today accidentally they fell off my bed and one of the little screw that holds the glass broke... now they're useless... I can't believe what just happened, I thought it was original... I feel so disappointed.‚Äã"
2.0,Ran very big
2.0,The zippers are at the bottom of two of the compartments so you can‚Äôt open them while it‚Äôs hanging
2.0,"the material is wack, so wrinkly and the color isn‚Äôt even the same."
2.0,It was delivered without the cuff links. Felt cheated. Have not even bothered to use it. Quality seems ok though. Did not come in any case. Tie and Square were just thrown into a package containing the shoes I also ordered.
2.0,I was about to return these but I figured out how to release/open it. Still it is very hard and I don't like it. It almost hurts my fingers.
2.0,I would give these tanks a 5 star rating however the color (green) tank top I wanted the most is defective and does not fit properly. Is there anyway to exchange just the green one for another? Thanks!
2.0,I do not recommend these earrings. They are very poor quality & the posts bend easily so I cant imagine what they would do to the skin of someone who has sensitive skin.
2.0,Unfortunately this bead is not as advertised.  Picture shows a headstone and grass however the bead itself is awful and looks moldy as the writing and picture are not clear.  We have asked for a refund.  I am in Bermuda so we expect to receive a full credit to my credit card.<br /><br />We will not be buying from neoblond anymore.
2.0,"These are billed as 'one size fits most', but I found them to be extremely large, I don't have a small head by any standard, and they are so loose that they really are sort of awkward to wear. The quality of the product is fine, its just way over sized."
2.0,"The cups were much too large for me. If I had sized down the band would've been too tight. Typical problem. This bra might work well for bustier ladies, but I'll also add that I didn't like the stiffness of the straps. They are edged with a thick material that makes them buckle rather than laying flat. I don't think the way the bra was folded up during shipping helped matters."
2.0,Elastic broke 1st time worn on all the shirts
2.0,"Top is super super thin and a little see-through. The fit was way off, about a size too large for me. There is little to no stretch in the fabric or stitching and the color is totally a matte burgundy in person. I expected there to be a little shimmer like the photos but I guess I just didn't read into it enough."
2.0,Looked great but was tight in sides and shoulders but was nice
2.0,Too big for a 3X....a 2X might be a better fit for me.....
2.0,What was advertised was not what I received. I wanted the dark wash dress with dark stitching and buttons/snaps . I received a dark wash denim dress with some sloppy tan stitching and silver snaps. I‚Äôve included pictures of what I got and one picture of what is pictured in the advertisement.
2.0,Gave to my niece.
2.0,Pants way to big
2.0,i ordered a small and just didnt fit my body well could be just me
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 165 lbs I bought a large but couldn‚Äôt button it because I carry my weight in my belly. The quality of the material is good but you have to be slim to pull these off.
2.0,"When the package arrived the small plastic case containing the earrings looked like the tape on it has been opened and reapplied. When I opened the case most of the earrings where in individual packages. The smallest size on both color were just sitting in the bottom, 2 were broken. Would return if I could, they clearly sold me atleast 4 used earrings."
2.0,Kudos for the design. Thumbs planted several feet underground for the thinness of the material.
2.0,Thin and not in the least bit warm.
2.0,"I wish the coat had a zipper vs buttons. The buttons are really loose. The coat however is so cute, and I like that the hood can be removed. Bright colors."
2.0,"Ad specifies US sizing, but sizing is actually Asian.  I ordered a XXXL which is advertised to be a 22-24W US.  However, I received a 5XL, which is advertised directly in the ad to be a 30-32W US (which would be enormous on me).  It looked smaller than I expected a 30-32W to look so decided to try it on.  I couldn't even get it up past my hips, and the body length looked like it was sized for someone who is very, very short.  This is definitely not US sized contrary to what is stated in the ad.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars because the design is nice."
2.0,Wore it for a couple weeks and the gold flakes off. What ever material it's made out of is now irritating my piercing. Could find another gold plated ring for similar price.
2.0,"The bottom is huge, the top is tiny."
2.0,Not a fan of how it lays after washed.  I've tried to iron it multiple times to get it to lay differently but no matter what the hems are always exposed.
2.0,Returned; did not like fit.
2.0,Tight won't stay on my head
2.0,"I really liked these sunglasses, the mirror finish was exactly what I was looking for. I had previously order this product and had great success and really enjoyed them. After ordering an additional pair I realize that the quality of the product is very inconsistent. They showed up with scratches in the lens already and had extra blue paint spread on the frame that would not come off."
2.0,"Stamping of images wasn't very good. Edges rough, should have been smoothed out before finish applied."
2.0,"This is the second pair of Polarspex sunglasses we've bought for our 4-year-old daughter. They're cute, they're comfortable, they have crap hinges. We spend a lot of time on or near the water, so I love that they're polarized, but they simply don't last long enough to gamble on a third pair. The first pair lasted a few months - mostly because they got left at Grandma's for quite a while; the second pair lasted all of 2 weeks before the arm broke off at the hinge. Back to Babiators for us, it seems."
2.0,Too small doesn‚Äôt fit according to size chart. It‚Äôs off about 2 sizes. I wear a small 4/6 everywhere and I would of needed a large for this to fit.
2.0,"The backpack, itself, is very well made and has the multiple compartments, that I need.  The best part is that the backpack is detachable from the rolling cart!  However the wheels are cheap, no bearings, and has a heavy rolling resistance.  I have purchased new roller wheels with bearing and will be swapping them out!"
2.0,The fit was GREAT but the color is not white. It‚Äôs an off white with a yellow tint. The shorts on the left in the picture are my 3 YEAR OLD white shorts for reference. These shorts (pictured on the right) are clearly not white. I would order a different color just for the fit though.
2.0,"This shirt is cute BUT runs VERY SMALL. I normally wear an XL. After reading some of the reviews, I ordered a 3xl so it would be a loose fit... well, a 3xl is tight on so it will be getting returned. SIZING IS WAAAAYYYYY OFF."
2.0,Love them however they are too long so they hurt to sleep in.
2.0,Smaller than expected and short.
2.0,Buttons are on the side
2.0,"I have now received theses glasses but in the wrong shape. Overall they‚Äôre ok, although the lenses are not polarized except one of the sunglasses."
2.0,"Not a fan of the material. Not a big fan of it overall. Their size chart is wrong.  I like the pattern and all, but it's made so so so cheaply.  Came earlier than expected tho. It wasn't due til 5/23, and it came today. That's about the ONLY positive. And the pattern on the shirt I got is different from the pic. Mine has big flowers at the neck, instead of like the model shirt. So, I dont understand that. This did it for me, I'm done buying clothing from China."
2.0,"I normally wear a xl.  After reading other reviews i ordered the largest size they had in this,  it was still too tight.  I'm keeping it with hopes of one day fitting in it, but the sizing is definitely off."
2.0,The frames of these glasses are not at all the colour in the photo. They are bright long yellow<br /><br />Not a good look.
2.0,"it's super cute, but it broke in half after wearing it for 3 days."
2.0,"Funky smell to them right out of the box.  Uncomfortable to wear, but am still trying to break them in."
2.0,"From the first time I saw this shirt I loved i and wanted to own it! I read many of the reviews and noticed a lot of inconsistencies - mostly the shirt seems to be way too large or way too small. I decided to take a gamble and see for myself...<br /><br />The shirt is just way too big! While I tend to prefer more form fitting shirts I do have several more relaxed shirts as well, but with this shirt it was too relaxed and the style did not work with a relaxed fit at all.<br /><br />I am a petite female and the overall relaxed fit of the shirt just came off as too large. I don‚Äôt understand why the same shirt can have people that get the shirt and report it runs small, others that it runs too large, and others that say it fits perfectly and is true to size. Very frustrating!!<br /><br />Since amazon offers free returns I would say give it a try if you are interested and hopefully you will get one that fits correctly (though that seems to be the minority to me at this point)."
2.0,"I really wanted to last longer. Pretty earrings but fell apart after I wore them twice. Then broke even more when I was trying to fix them. Too late to return, but I do not recommend buying them."
2.0,"to small, to short"
2.0,Great quality however u must hv narrow feet n NO Cavs no muscles in your lower legs to be able to get these boots on.
2.0,Was like in the picture but it is still okay
2.0,I bought this bathing suit in the size I normally buy. The bottoms fit perfectly but the top is way to small. I read all the reviews and thought I was buying the right size for my top. I am a 36ddd and this didn't even hold a third of my sisters.
2.0,Not easy to get on
2.0,"Soft material and style, however if you have any rolls of fat I mean any, it will show it!  No matter how big the shirt. The material hugs in all the wrong places.  Made for skinny people."
2.0,I wanted Red...it said red...it's not!
2.0,The only problem about these... They will unscrew themselves if you don't retighten them at least once a day
2.0,"I so wanted to love these,  but they were really long and loose, they were unflattering. I am 5'3 125 lbs and I got the small, it was too big and the proportions were odd, I thought these were going to be shorter shorts."
2.0,"Maybe it's just me, but I found they did not reduce headlight glare and vision was a little blurry."
2.0,The lights don‚Äôt work all the time but other than that they are cute
2.0,shapeless and I look pregnant; I am 5.10 and 57 kg! very good as house dress and I like the material...I kept it for that
2.0,it bends considerably when using. works but I wouldn't recomend
2.0,for kids ok NEVER for your Wife is cheap
2.0,Much smaller than American sizes
2.0,It fit perfect in the waste but really big in the hip area
2.0,"Very cheap, thin plastic fabric.  Hat arrived stuffed in plastic bag all wrinkled.  I am returning it. It did not look anything like the picture"
2.0,It shrunk up a lot after first wash in cold and hanging to dry.  Returned.
2.0,"Beard cape fit husband fine, now to figure out how to make him use it.<br /><br />UFO or haircut cape is child size. Several inches too small. Yes it‚Äôs smaller than the beard cape. Is too small to use on husband and teenage daughter. Kinda sorta made it work by sewing several inches of Velcro on top of neck Velcro closure, however it will not sit properly across the shoulders. And is an interesting balancing act to try to keep the hair from pouring out.<br /><br />Overall I would return but I still have hope that my husband will use the cape. I hear an an incredible quote: No Capes!! And that I modified the UFO. I will someday make an appropriate adult size UFO if I can find time‚Ä¶.<br /><br />Don‚Äôt bother"
2.0,"Pretty, but the clasps don't work right.  And really too big for every day wear."
2.0,"After one wash this dress on delicate, this dress looks like I've washed it 50+ times. I ordered a Medium because of other reviews that say it is tight, but even the Medium was way too tight."
2.0,More like a belly shirt
2.0,The large top fits like a medium
2.0,Not well finished and feels flimsy. Next time I will spend a little more for a better product
2.0,They came today and I was so excited they fit great but because of the lack of packaging they‚Äôre already scratched. There‚Äôs a 100% satisfaction Guarantee- but no way to contact the seller....
2.0,"Material,was flimsy, arm holes were very big"
2.0,The plastic insert that holds the stud to the back came loose in two wears. Now they are useless.
2.0,I was not expecting great quality however this looks very very cheap... I won't be wearing it
2.0,"Poorly made, I tried putting one on and it snapped. Save your money"
2.0,"I bought as a gift for a friend. I bought XXL and it‚Äôs actually more like a large. Smelled absolutely horrible, I hope the smell goes away when washed. No pocket in front"
2.0,"Un fracaso total esta blusa, muy grande las mangas no encajan en los hombros, y el material no es muy fuerte, compre una small, definitivamente la voy a retornar, esta blusa est√° mal hecha, en la parte del pecho encaja bien pero en los hombros no.<br />a total failure this blouse the sleeves do not fit on the shoulders and the fabric does not look very drastic I will definitely return it, This blouse is poorly made on the breasts it fits well but on the shoulders it does not."
2.0,"It‚Äôs exactly as pictured, super cute! Sizing is off though. My daughter wears 6-9 month clothing and weighs 16.5lbs. I ordered the 6-12 month size and the skirt was too tight at the waist, yet the under shirt was too large. I was able to cut the button off the skirt and move it closer to the hem line to make it fit, it had about .75 of an inch for me to move it over. Luckily that was enough and she‚Äôll be able to wear it for Xmas, over a plain white onesie we have because the top included is too large. If the sizing was more consistent it‚Äôd be great."
2.0,After the first waking. The material is very clingy and makes for an uncomfortable feel.
2.0,"Super hard to get them in my nose with this angle, might just be my nose."
2.0,"I've had two (maybe three) pairs of these slippers in the past and really liked them, as they were comfortable and held up very well, even though I wore them a lot. This past year I wore one pair constantly and when they started to break down, I ordered a new pair. Within two week, the sole started separating from one slipper. So, I returned the pair and had a replacement pair sent, figuring it was just a fluke. The newest pair arrived and within two days the leather lace surrounding one slipper pulled out, having not been sewn in properly. So, I returned them and got a refund. Now I see the price has been reduced from $31.27 to $14.99... Buyer beware!"
2.0,Size not accurate AT ALL Way too small adult sizes
2.0,The quality of the cloth it is just ok and did  not like it so I returned.
2.0,"The first picture is how it arrived, no pretty black decorative line showing at the neckline and the bottom fabric was upside down from the model's dress. I ended up ripping out the bottom piece, flipping it around and had it sewn the way the model's dress looked like. I also took in the bottom of each arm hole, and cut and re-hemmed the neckline. I am short (5'1""), so I also had to have about 2 inches taken up from the bottom of the dress. All in all, it is a pretty dress that I will wear several times."
2.0,The clasp and chain areas constantly come apart
2.0,Within a month the drawstrings came out in the wash and the fabric started to tear
2.0,"Super cute, but while the bottoms fit really well, the top is huge and made poorly. I use the bottoms with a different top to swim laps now."
2.0,This is a nice shirt but it was ordered for a very tall and somewhat big male and it fit about 2 sizes too small in length and width. Definitely sized inaccurately.
2.0,"I loved the style they were too small, I gave them to a friend"
2.0,This dress was not well-made and had extra material in unflattering places. Some of the sewing/hemming was also poor quality and the pattern was asymmetrical.
2.0,I am 146 lbs and 5'1. I ordered a size small which I expected to fit my height too. The legging area is way too long it actually covers the bottom of the heels of my feet. The material is very thin almost see through. Its still a cute jumpsuit. It just didn't work in my favor.
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt happy after my first time that it was unraveling.
2.0,If it was a little thicker it would be perfect
2.0,I can't get it to fit over chest. Definitely not made for woman with breasts. Largest size might fit a teenager
2.0,Glasses are light weight but did not realize the frames do not stay open when not on. Nor do they ever close completely. Always takes 2 hands to put them on. Not ideal - don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôd be made this way. Broke in under a year.
2.0,"These briefs are comfortable for day-to-day wear, and would be supportive enough for moderate athletic use if they weren‚Äôt so flimsy.<br />They do not stand up well to wear, especially in activities like horse and bike riding, tearing out in the seat."
2.0,"Yea it covers your head, it's kinda small, you can't see very well, I just hate it."
2.0,"Fit true to size.  I did not like the fabric, very silky."
2.0,These socks are extremely small and see-through.
2.0,Runs small but very pretty.
2.0,This 100 mixed style was 40 pieces short. I just hand counted 60 locks so what about the rest?
2.0,"A little disappointed because I have been looking for a good insole for my work boots and just when I thought I was going to get some relief, they‚Äôre too small. The size 10 does not fit a size 10 work boot. I suggest size 11. Half my heel is hanging off the back but I have no other choice until I get another pair."
2.0,"This is much cuter in the picture than in person.  It is very soft, but shorter than I thought it would be.  I am a short person - 5'2"" - so a taller woman may find it to be too short.  On one side the seam that put the two parts together was very visible which detracted significantly from the look."
2.0,The large is too small and the ex-large is much bigger.  The neck on the Life is Good tees stretch and become sloppy.  The old ones didn't do that.
2.0,very poor quality and I am considering asking my eye doctor if a verification is possible to prove the claims of UV protection. The fit is comfortable.
2.0,"The size is good, fits good. The problem was I received a blue one and I asked for a black one. This make me upset becuase returning stuff is a big hassle. This is why I'm giving it 2 stars"
2.0,Not that warm.
2.0,I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and 113 lbs I ordered size S it fits me nicely but maybe a tiny bit big. The quality of the red part is great nice and soft. The lace part ruined after one washed. I‚Äôm very disappointed and I wore only one time. The tag didn‚Äôt say hand wash so I put in the washer and got ruined üòí
2.0,It's a little less than ok. Not very flattering.
2.0,Half the colors do not work
2.0,My son was SO excited to get this amazing shirt. It is gorgeous. It is comfortable and fits well. I washed in cold water on gentle cycle and it fell apart. The seams came out. I was all of my fancy workshirts this way and have no problems. There were no washing instructions or tag on the shirt. My son is so disappointed.
2.0,"I love the look of this keychain, but it was made so poorly! The swan part kept falling off and now I lost it. DO NOT BUY!!"
2.0,Arms are small and not like the picture
2.0,"Lo √∫nico que puedo aporta que la tela no  es como se ve en la foto,  la tela no es de buena calidad,"
2.0,"Well constructed bag, but the measurements/dimensions were not accurate.  And as a result, I sent it back."
2.0,"Wrong size shipped , over all quality seems so so,  for 40$ I would expect much better quality.<br />It‚Äôs a product for home use."
2.0,"This belt was a Christmas gift and we have already sent this first one back (failed buckle like other reviews) and now the second one has failed the exact same was as the first. The belt itself is great and has held up well, but the buckles are horrible and won't stay together with normal use. If you do buy this belt, be ready to replace the buckle within a few months of use!"
2.0,"These were wonderful out of the box, looked good on, fit nice, fabric was thick enough you could do a squat and not show your a**, but after I put them on, they wouldn‚Äôt stay up. I would take a step and they would slide down an inch, by the time I walked down the hall they were half off. I don‚Äôt know if it was the waist style or the fabric but it wasn‚Äôt worth it."
2.0,"The shoe was entirely too small, despite ordering a half size up ."
2.0,I bought this in beige.  I have a 32 inch waist and when I use the first hook the part of the suede which is at the back of the rose shows on one side of the belt only.  The rose is not in the middle as it should be.  I tried it on the other two hooks and it looks even worst.  Whilst the rose is very pretty and the belt stretches a lot the elastic is already unraveling on the edge so this makes the belt look old.  I was very disappointed.  I gave it 2 stars for the color and the rose!
2.0,Weird design. Weird feel. Just meh.
2.0,"Got as a gift. They looked soooooo cute. Smaller than I anticipated though. But soon as I took them off at the end of the day, the post broke off. Oh, and took like two months to get here."
2.0,Ordered a small. As a person with small boobs the top was too big.
2.0,The magnetic band loosens as the day goes and my watch slips off.
2.0,Too small order two sizes up
2.0,"This necklace really is beautiful, but the chain is cheap.  It constantly breaks, and I'm always having to fix it.  It is rather annoying.  With a different chain this would be a much better necklace."
2.0,Not cut right.<br />Awkward fit.
2.0,Flimsy but nice thought
2.0,It is a glittery gold hat--not what I expected.  I was looking for a more natural straw.  The description should state the metallic gold is the main color.  the pic looks more straw and the description makes it seem like the glitter is more of an accent.  It should be sold as GOLD METALLIC hat.  I will be returning.
2.0,"I followed the chart and ordered a size up per the chart and all the recommendations and it was way too big in all areas. Material was ok, not sure if I would have kept it if it fit."
2.0,This was a birthday gift for my daughter. The seams came apart right away and I constantly have to sew it back together.
2.0,Costume fits well and looks good.<br />The window to see out of is in the bottom of the beak and you cannot see a thing when the head is up right.
2.0,"Sizes run s/m, l/ xl, o 2xxl, 3xxl, I normally order a lg for upper body, I have a 42 in chest and a 32 in waist. Reviews stated these ran a little big so I ordered a s/m and it was marked as such. It fit like a circus tent, the shoulder-arm joints came down 4 in below my shoulders on both sides and the torso area was equally large. Will not order this brand again"
2.0,"Not 100% cotton, as we noted in the description."
2.0,can hardly tell its working. not very warm at all
2.0,These dresses are cheaply made. I bought 5 different designs and I regret spending money on them! Not what I expected at all. Total waste of money!!!!
2.0,"The length is more, the color is one shade darker and the bottoms is aligned with the thigh width so after wearing it makes  me looks way different then it is shown in the picture. Perhaps they can narrow the bottom and cut down like 3 inches from bottom so that it would match with the photo shown here."
2.0,"I like the size of the earrings. However, the backs of the earrings fall off easily. Almost lost one earring 2x."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt get the right color like the one they show on the picture ..
2.0,"I bought theses for my son‚Äôs Halloween costume, so I only needed one night‚Äôs worth of wear. I figured I would donate them after Halloween, but my son really liked them and wanted to keep them. He said they‚Äôre comfy and lightweight. He‚Äôs worn them to school for a month and a handful of tennis lessons and both shoes have holes at the end of the toe box.<br /><br />They served our purpose, but I‚Äôd hate for someone to buy these thinking they can last your child a year or until they outgrow them. They don‚Äôt stand a chance against an active kid."
2.0,"For the price.. The products are quite overprice @ $14.99 a piece. Quality wise, Just One Star.. Sorry, Not Satisfied. I'm only keeping<br />One(1) unit of the Sunglasses.. ( I Ordered 3 pcs.. Based only on the Picture Samples ) I will be Sending back Two (2) units..<br />Hopefully, I'll get a better quality next time. Kindly Refund' me for the two items I'm returning.. Truly Yours' .. RB Seruelo.."
2.0,Material is heavy but always wrinkled. I can‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôve never even worn it out of the house bc I hate the way it looks after just a little bit of time
2.0,"Great design, but even though I got the same size as my shoes, fit was way too small. (My toes were jammed up against the front.) I ended up returning these and kept a pair of Demango water sport shoes (which are perfect) bought at the same time."
2.0,"The band is well made, but it's designed for giant wrists. It looked like a kindergartener wearing a big person watch on my wrist."
2.0,"The fabric was a little weird, I received the product very quickly - just didn't like the quality of the fabric or the way it fit to my body. gave me an old lady butt"
2.0,"The cord does't stay on the bow of the glasses.  Also, within a day, one of the cords lost its attachment that holds it to the glasses."
2.0,"I purchased my exact sz but it was too small, especially in the chest area"
2.0,"I thought this was a light weight cotton. It is at least 60% polyester, very thin and not what I was hoping for. You get what you pay for!"
2.0,There was a nasty smell inside the purse. Like dead fish. Spraying with Fabreeze and putting an incense stick in it was helpful.
2.0,"Well, this don‚Äôt live up to their title!  They provide no compression. More like a black undershirt."
2.0,"Comfortable, but fits enormous . The small was swimming on me."
2.0,They are definitely lightweight but the fabric takes a couple washes to be soft and comfortable. The biggest bummer for me was that the colors are not at all the same in person.
2.0,Not what I expected when I ordered it.
2.0,"Clung, not flattering like it looks on models"
2.0,Too large for me even I bought my size not expected as described.
2.0,wrong green that's shown in the picture also smelled when got it so i washed it the decals are peeling off
2.0,The blue and black is not very cute.  Not a very pretty color of blue and it doesn't go well with the black.
2.0,Came tarnished right out of the package. I‚Äôve worn it a couple days and the ball inside doesn‚Äôt glow and the tarnishing has already increased. It is cute though and seems sturdy.
2.0,"I order a xl,look how small the waist is,I thought it was going to stretch, but I could barely fit one leg in, and I normally wear a size 14. Then it had a ball of string hanging in the middle. Material was nice, so beside that order 5 sizes up..."
2.0,First time we used them the handle came off on the large Spinner. Otherwise the color is great but the spinners do not expand....
2.0,Back post came bent.  The posts are very thin an I double will endure much use.
2.0,These were not the same quality as the ones I purchased from TJ MAXX. They are much thinner and the stitching held up all of 2 workouts. I wouldn't purchase these again.
2.0,Love the feel and concept. Watch APPEARS to fit firmly inside. And band feels great on wrist. I like that the excess tucks in underneath to tighten band and secure better on wrist.<br /> However.. CAN NOT CHARGE !! After repeatedly having to remove/replace the watch to charge it.. I'm guessing it won't fit snug and I'll end up losing a $200 Watch over a $9 band. Will be returning.<br />P.S.<br />Shame on Samsung for not making/selling replacement bands and for making the original as poorly as they did.
2.0,Not exactly what I expected. Looks a little cheap. You get what you pay for.
2.0,I like the shirt and color of it... but its thin and does not fit right. I got the XL and to make it work i need to lose 5lbs. I also have a bigger chest and it just does not fit right. THis is ment for a women who is small in general. I wear a M-L in closes and this XL did not work well for me. Im going to keep it but i might hand it off to a friend since its still a decent shirt.
2.0,The waistband and outer skirt fit like a medium but the underskirt was about a size 2. The one I received may have been defective. I am returning it and buying something more true to size.
2.0,Stitches ripped after only a couple of times of me putting it on. The pumpum on top fell off rather quickly
2.0,"doesn't actually stay over my face, but it is soft"
2.0,"I wore this necklace one time and it broke before I could wear it again. I can probably fix it because it broke a joint, but I don't think I should have to fix a necklace after one wear. It served it's purpose for family photos, but had hoped I could get more uses out it."
2.0,Did not last to long but what's expected for an inexpensive shoe.  Very thin insole but that can be remedied with an insole.  Kept my feet warm though but that didn't matter when I can't use it during slushy snow weather with the sole cracked.  Would not buy again.
2.0,I ordered a size up thinking that would be the save idea and boy was I wrong I like it other then that just mad it doesn't fit
2.0,"Thought 3 inch waist would mean these leggings would stay up, but they are hip huggers and therefore fall down. Does not match picture."
2.0,They are tiny!!! Not wide at all. 9 year old son can‚Äôt even wear them
2.0,"I really wanted to love this bra; it really is just beautiful. But, there is some kind of error in the contruction.  The cups didn't have any projection (they were flat instead of 3D).  I am not super well endoweded but the underwires hovered awkwardly inches away from my body."
2.0,I returned these pants because I didn't like the think cheap fabric.
2.0,this dress is nothing like the picture<br />It is not sized properly<br />it looks like an arts and craft project gone bad<br />its too bad I missed the deadline for return<br />What was meant to be a communion dress now has to be a hollowing play dress
2.0,"Actually in love with the fit/feel of these leggings! Sadly, the seam on my inner thigh ripped the second day I wore them. ‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,the texture of the fabric is not what I expected
2.0,"not good, the colour came off the lens"
2.0,Pretty but broke 5 minutes after putting it on for the first time.  Had to return.
2.0,"Thought this watch bad was beautiful to start. However after wearing the watch band w/ the crystal face 3 times total, one of the crystals popped off the face (not pictured because pic was unclear/fuzzy) but the band has a sticker on it that peeled off (I have included the pics). Was hoping it would last, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Very minimal compression (I prefer a stronger hold). The material is really soft but the fabric is not moisture wicking as I prefer to have for working out. They‚Äôre very comfortable for casual wear. They‚Äôre kind of long on my frame (even for a full length legging) material gathers @ my ankles.
2.0,Makes me look like a grampa....too boxy
2.0,My 8 year old daughter really loved it as her Christmas present however I have to give 2 stars because the cork that tops off the bottle broke on the first day which caused the screw to come loose causing the chain to detach from the bottle. The chain provided is ok but very poorly made as well. We're  going to try to crazy glue it back together and hope it stays a little longer.
2.0,Poorly cut - plaid cut crooked<br />Pretty boxy fit<br />Could have just been a one off but I didn‚Äôt reorder
2.0,"The style is pretty, but if I order red the color should be red, not burnt sienna. Very orangey, brownish red."
2.0,Material was not as it appears in picture it was very light weight
2.0,This is very cute but sizing is off and a xl fits like a small not for someone with larger breasts and a slight tummy had to wear it as a jacket
2.0,Stone's were loose!!!!! Have to glue them back on!!!!! But that's OK!!!!! I guess!!!!!
2.0,I dislike how the sleeves fit and the back on the neck rises to high. Really wanted to like this jersey.
2.0,The face of the watch is too small for a man‚Äôs wrist. Quality is more like a $50.00 watch.
2.0,I got the 0-12 months they are super small I would say 0-3 months
2.0,Crappy abs don't form well to head.
2.0,"This fits a little on the small side, and though I don‚Äôt really mind the polyester, I mean it‚Äôs cheap, but the seams we‚Äôre really scratchy. I really loved the pattern/color though. It‚Äôs too bad. It went back. I would recommend you size up one size from where you think."
2.0,The belt was just fine until it broke at the point that made it reversible
2.0,The beads are huge for a children'n set. They are even bulky for myself as a parent. Very pretty colors and good quality but the size is not suitable for kids.
2.0,"Stayed lit, but the ‚Äú shoe string‚Äù broke after the 2nd time of wearing them, & then the other shoe caught a shortage. Not worth the money"
2.0,Sleeves are too small for real comfort.
2.0,Got this for my girlfriend since she looks A LOT like Jennifer Lawrence. She wore it three times and it broke. The pendent is nice but the chain itself is cheap.
2.0,"I guess I didn‚Äôt look at the diameter, but these were just way too small. I was intending to use them as septum jewelry."
2.0,I looked like a grandma in this dress.
2.0,Good quality but I paid for a XXXL and it fit  more like a XL or at the most a XXL
2.0,Small in the chest area
2.0,"The dress is too small, even though I buy all my dresses online one size larger."
2.0,Cute shirt but the font of the words are not the same as the picture. Which is no biggie BUT the sizing is off. I ordered a large...the tag said large but it‚Äôs not a large. Fits more like a smedium. I wish it fit loose like the picture for working out but I‚Äôd still wear it around the house.
2.0,"I loved this item but unfortunately it would not love me,I bought a medium thinking it would fit nicely what I should have bought was a small, the legs are fine the top is falling off me and its extremely thin,I was not impressed..infact I'm thinking of returning it an getting a refund"
2.0,"I wouldn't recommend this product. The primary reason is because although the quality of the goods in appearance are decent and strong the actual clips, or, clasp do not hold the shirt properly. This may have been because the shirts I was using may have not been the best material (60 cotton / 40 polyester blend ) for the clasp to stick but this is my experience.<br /><br />I will not be returning the shirt stays  due to the low the cost (which I applaud for a nice attempt.) But, I plan to either MacGyver something together with safety pins or purchase from another vendor.<br /><br />Short Story:<br />I was excited to receive my shirt stays but upon use I became disappointed and have I regretfully have decided to not purchase from Buttons & Pleats again."
2.0,Not what I expected the material looks and feels more like a raincoat
2.0,Was not as solid feeling as other wooden ones I have had. I carry in my pocket and was hoping for something that had a durable feel.
2.0,Don‚Äôt fit good
2.0,"These were ok, but they run large.  Wish they would have had a xs,"
2.0,Sizes are not even close to being the correct sizes
2.0,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who said the spaghetti straps are too large, leaving most of your chest exposed. I really liked the print on this fabric so I thought I'd give it a shot but I sadly have to return it."
2.0,My order was missing the top piece of the set and looked like someone had already worn it. It was wrinkly and tossed in the bad like laundry. Also - no returns. Be weary.
2.0,Only 4 months of use and it‚Äôs completely falling apart. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
2.0,"Same as picture, runs very small & material is thin. Mine was torn at the button area & it didnt fit. I had to return"
2.0,These pjs are so comfortable but easily torn.
2.0,Looks like crap and cheap.
2.0,One cane with one sweater not both
2.0,"Vey cheap.  After three uses,  the hinge breaks off. I wouldn't suggest them."
2.0,"I am a 12/14 and XXL was waaaay too small. It was quite tight in the thighs and it did not cover my chest at all. The strings to tie around the neck were also very short, I couldn't tie it. It's cute and mostly looks like the picture but you can tell it is very cheaply made. This is not a quality suit. Get what you pay for I guess. My sister is shorter than me so I am going to have her try it. For the price I paid seems like giving it away will be easier than trying to send it back.  Bummer though! The picture was cute and I really wanted to like it."
2.0,"Nice short, fits well but too many large seams inside. Kind of irritating On the skin, but I‚Äôm super sensitive about that stuff."
2.0,"This has no elasticity and broke right away. It is cheaply made (which that is what you get for cheap products sometimes), but it was very flattering in the hair."
2.0,Instant return. The dimensions are not as advertised. Super small and not close to fit my needs as a go bag.
2.0,I will be sending 1 of 2 pairs back bc 1 pair will not stay closed
2.0,The necklace broke moments out of the package.<br />Nice tooth though being plastic
2.0,"Slippers are really cute! But they run small, and very tight on the heel. I would like to exchange them for a size up but they don‚Äôt have more sizes."
2.0,"Pretty dissapointed in this.  The material the shorts are made out of, are paper thin.  I am concerned about durability, and just im general a bathing suit paper thin coming out of the water...  The pictures make it look better than it is"
2.0,top could be a little looser
2.0,Made out of thin leather. Tore the first time trying on
2.0,"too thin,cheap brand not effective for  perspiration absorption."
2.0,I wore these twice before the seam separated for no reason. These fit perfectly otherwise but the stitching was poor.
2.0,"Cute, but the fit was a little off and the quality was way cheaper than I expected."
2.0,These hurt the bridge of my nose.
2.0,I have a decently large wrist so I had no chance of this being of use for me as it seams to be more for children.
2.0,"Omg, this thing was teeny tiny... I ended up giving to a fried I know has to be at least 3 cup sizes smaller than me... oh well, at least someone loves it!"
2.0,"Order one size up, fit is smaller than listed."
2.0,2 stars because the color is not like the photo
2.0,The fit is off. Top of sandals are beyond loose and bottom straps cut off circulation. There is glue all around the edges of both shoes. That‚Äôs fine for a $10 pair‚Ä¶not $40. I would not recommend these shoes.
2.0,Very slim fitting and not a great material.
2.0,I don't really care for these headbands. They are cheap looking and came very wrinkled & bent. They also sit weird on my daughter's head. Some of the bows are coming apart from the band & you can see the dried glue on the back where they attach. I would not buy these again.
2.0,It fits very tightly around your upper arm and cuts into your armpit. Required considerable alterations to be wearable
2.0,I love the wide straps but they don't stay up on ur shoulders even with tightening them.
2.0,"Some of the stitching is unraveling. When my son called Carhartt, they said that they allow another company to use their name and therefore didn't really stand behind the product. Very disappointing!!! Carhartt usually has really nice quality products. My son is going to take it to the shoe repair and hopefully he can fix it."
2.0,Expect you are going to need to order one size larger then you usually wear.
2.0,They were OK. Looked pretty online. In person quite large and gaudy.
2.0,This thing is stiff and tight.  It gives me headaches because of the pressure it uses to press against my head.  It does block out a great deal of noise.
2.0,Definitely a halloween costume-type dress. Not fit for other events.
2.0,"I normally wear a size 4-6 in clothes but always size up in swimsuits. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 127 ponds and I have a long torso. I ordered this suit in a 10 and an 8. The 10 was big all over. The 8 (which is the size most of my swimsuits are) was also too big, especially across the chest. I am a D cup and the suit gapped on each side under my arms. It didn‚Äôt seem like a long torso length either. I returned them both. On the plus side it is a nice contemporary style and made of thick textured material that would hide flaws. It just didn‚Äôt fit me, it seemed short and wide."
2.0,Not as pictured...
2.0,This was poorly made and huge! The medium almost fits me and I am 5‚Äô4 130 pounds.
2.0,"Size five was not designed properly. Portion that goes around the ankle was super tiny. I've bought this brand in the past and loved it, so not sure why these weren't as good."
2.0,Cute but broke after wearing it two days. Not happy.
2.0,"This shirt looks really cute and really good for a casual day but still dressing up in the picture. Once I got the shirt, which took forever to ship, it was super long. It was also really big. I had it tailored in the sides, although it fits better the arm parts are still too big so I don't really wear it. I recomend you not getting this, its cheaply made and you won't wear it much."
2.0,"Backs are too heavy, so instead of the earring staying horizontal, the back dangles straight down because the weight is not evenly distributed and pulls your earlobe funny."
2.0,Too tight a fit for normal paper money.
2.0,Broke after 3 weeks
2.0,"I bought the blye and black one, the blue is a bright royal blue definitely not the same as pic at all. The black also is more a navy and not black. The sewing in the items are definitely not the best at all. The size as well is not either."
2.0,"This is a beautiful belt, and the metal work is wonderful. However, my daughter wore it for ONE DAY and it was falling apart. All the blue was cracked and coming off, and she can't wear it anymore because it's just destroyed. Don't waste your money."
2.0,"I've never worn leggings before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I haven't worn these yet, because the first time I tried them on I wasn't impressed. They're very, very snug - I was expecting a little bit more of a denim structure to them, but that's not the case. I don't agree with the reviews that said these can be mistaken for jeans."
2.0,"I purchased two pair of these Isotoner gloves as gifts because the description mentioned ""cold weather gloves with warm lining."" However they are not suitable for cold weather. The material and lining is very thin and not warm. They also seem small compared to other Isotoner gloves I've purchased in the past. I will have to return both pair."
2.0,The balls are super tiny and hard to manage
2.0,"The tie rides along the bottom of my rib cage (ordered large for 5'11&#34;) instead of along waist. The tie also lacks the friction to keep the robe closed, unless you tie it in a knot.<br />The fabric is also fairly cheep feeling and not very soft."
2.0,Not ok!
2.0,"While these boots certainly look good, I discovered that the ‚Äú1000 Mile‚Äù moniker to be overly optimistic (delusional really) if they mean actual walking.  I did drive 1000 miles with them on, so perhaps I‚Äôm being overly critical. After four months, I discovered a dime size hole on my right sole; a cobbler is in my future. I can only recommend these boots for functions of short duration, until then, carry them around in a bag and wear flip-flops. Cheers sugar-bums!"
2.0,They are pretty but they came all wrinkle
2.0,I love the pattern on the band but it is very stiff and slides around my wrist.
2.0,Granddaughter was not happy at all. Very thin. Do not buy this for warmth. Only for show.
2.0,Would have been so cute if it fit. Order way up to have some room and comfort.
2.0,Seems like a comfortable shirt but too tight around hips and buttocks area. Order up a size.
2.0,Runs very small. The material is very cheap. The back of the swimsuit isn‚Äôt adjustable and the part that cross crosses on the bottom isn‚Äôt attached.
2.0,Really just junk...no real metal just very junky plastic painted to look like metal :(
2.0,The dress is much shorter than it appears to be.
2.0,Did not look like picture. Is like silky material. Low neckline. Not work appropriate. Darker color. Very disappointing
2.0,Bien diferente a la foto y muy corto de pata
2.0,Not real happy the way this shirt looks across the shoulders. Upper part hangs too big
2.0,It‚Äôs a nice wallet but the strap broke off with in 2 weeks of having it.
2.0,"Disappointed, not long as described, more like swimsuit material"
2.0,"I really didnt like anything about this dress. The way the lace is on the arms kinda looks like cheetah print and the tie at the waist was too low for me, it looked very awkward on."
2.0,the padding in the bra is uneven and the material is kind of scratchy. low quality product. had to return it.
2.0,Still have the bag. I was disappointed. Looks white but is not.
2.0,It did not have pockets. So disappointed. It's the multicolor flower one.
2.0,Broke within 2 weeks. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,I'll start positive. The set is very cute. I bought 25 of them for a youth choir. I was able to mix and match the sets and only had eight sets that weren't broken.  The rest of them had the earring piece not attached and one had a broken necklace.  I don't have time to return so I'll have to glue them together  and hope they stay attached.  Clearly these are not being assembled well.  I would appreciate some contacting me for a refund of some kind.
2.0,The fit was true to size but my daughter tugged at the seat a lot and complained that the inside seams were itchy.
2.0,"When I received the earring, the back of one had comletely unwelded from the earring. When I went to return I was not offered a replacement, only a refund. Thought that the earrings were very pretty so I was disappointed but I did not reorder."
2.0,I ordered this hat twice in the hopes that the second purchase would not have the dye from the packaging on it. Unfortunately both times the hat had a blueish dye from the tag's cord rubbed off on the fabric. Other than having to return them the quality seemed very nice.
2.0,"To be completely honest, they're not that great. Girlfriend loves them, but that's about their only merit. They constantly ride up my legs, crowding my junk and are just generally uncomfortable. They're super soft, so they feel great at first, but after about five minutes of wearing them, it's pretty much an octopus in a mesh hammock."
2.0,"I normally wear a 10.5<br />I read that these run true to size, maybe a tad small. I ordered size 11.<br />When they arrived, I couldn't even get them onto my feet.<br />These do NOT run true to size. They are small. Very small.<br />Other Olukai products that I own seem to run true to size, maybe a tad large. These are not the same.<br />These are small.<br />There was also a good amount of scuffing all over the boot, which isn't a huge deal for me but may be for others."
2.0,A little on the large size with kind of small leg openings. The elastic around the leg holes feels bindings after a couple of hours of wear. One pair is already coming apart on one of the seams. Fabric is nice quality and colors are nice.<br /><br />Overall would not recommend or purchase again.
2.0,"I thought this was super cute, especially for the price. But after the first day of wearing it it started to get rusty. By day two, the heart detached from the ring."
2.0,"I bought this bag as a weekend getaway bag. I never use it. The photos show it as if it has a shape too it. It doesn‚Äôt. It is like a sac versus a bag. It would make a good laundry bag. I was disappointed; however, I didn‚Äôt return it because I loved the pattern and the price wasn‚Äôt too costly."
2.0,This message is to be a size 10 and it came like a size one seriously too small it‚Äôs not quite what I expected from the picture but I did give it away to somebody who had little teeny fingers
2.0,"Ok for he $ , not overly comfortable or durable"
2.0,"It looks like someone took a pink ink pen and outlined the corners of the shirt pocket. There‚Äôs also a few other ink splatters of pink on the shirt. I am petite. The fit is oversized so a lot looser than I expected. The hem is a dramatic high low which is not stated in the description. The fabric feels nice, but it is a bit see through."
2.0,it was okay yet too big
2.0,"The fabric felt yucky, really low quality. I didn‚Äôt even bother to try it on because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt want to wear it. It also has a back zipper, and the buttons are decorative only. I would have liked this better if the fabric were nicer to the touch and also if it was a true button up. Returning this item."
2.0,"FYI the bust that these items are shown on are not true to body size, so the jewelry is much smaller. It is too plastic looking and the colors are much brighter looking, which makes it look cheaper."
2.0,"They were a bit small, liked the matl and zipper pocket but just didn‚Äôt work size wise."
2.0,Size chart is waayyyyy off! Going by the size chart I ordered a 5X. More like an extra large. The arms are small and very snug fitting. The waist isn‚Äôt horrible and the chest is tight. Thankfully I can still wear it and it doesn‚Äôt look too bad but not the comfortable fit I was hoping for.
2.0,Received the item and it has a hole.
2.0,"Had to return as it fit 1-2 full sizes too small. Disappointing, because it appeared to be a nice quality item."
2.0,"The material was much different than regular leggings, it‚Äôs a much cheaper fabric. The fit was odd, they‚Äôre mid rise at best, definitely not high rise. I was not impressed by these at all and ordered two pairs."
2.0,This hat is not the hat in the picture.
2.0,"Very nice, but extremely small sized. It &#34;chokes&#34; my rist. Hahaha"
2.0,Seems they're starting to fray all overüòï
2.0,"Cute but not roomy. Doesn‚Äôt have many pockets and nowhere for change, very tight and small."
2.0,Would LOVE this if the size was right. XXL fit like a medium.
2.0,Too small on me. Couldn‚Äôt even wear it.
2.0,"Physically it is fine, but it's not even close to the color that is shown as the product photo.  Again, there is nothing wrong with the product itself, I just wish the picture shown was even remotely close to what showed up."
2.0,"Demasiado grande no es como describe la foto. En la foto se ve mas bello. Personalmente no es tanto, tambien varia el color."
2.0,We ordered an XXL and it was still 2 small. They are not US sizes.
2.0,"Cute belt , but unfortunately it is starting to come apart. Had and worn exactly 1 week"
2.0,It gets tangle and I have to be taken off and fix constantly.
2.0,"These shirts fit so strange. Chest fits fine, but the sleeves are way too big. They fit like a 3/4 length baseball tee. Way too big."
2.0,"When I got this thing it wasn‚Äôt even what was described, the description was a slim wallet with a money clip, when I got it there was no money clip and instead was a money pocket, in the end I still kept it because I actually prefer a pocket but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is false advertising"
2.0,The matereal was too ruff. It shrink also. And the color fade also. Sorry
2.0,Upon opening the package this is what I found. I'm hesitant to keep this jewelry because I'm afraid it's not sterile.
2.0,"This shirt is adorable but the size chart is way off. The size tag is in Asian measurements so its possible they just sent the wrong size. But it is about 3 sizes too small.<br />The quality is fantastic though....I don't think I'm going to send it back because its so adorable. It's more of a T-shirt material, not sweatershirt but its soft and well sewn. If it was the right size, would have given it 5 stars."
2.0,You can‚Äôt read the Words !
2.0,These are not much more than a thin piece of polyester sewn together. Very thin single layer and feels like it would not stand up to any actual use.
2.0,I haven't purchased this yet but I'm just wondering why is it a dress? Owlette wears a jumpsuit like  Catboy and Geico.
2.0,"Both the chain and letters are pretty thin. Not like the picture, but I guess u get what you pay for."
2.0,"I'm a medium in just about everything (5'5"", 135'ish lbs) but I got this in a large.  I am by no means fat, but i felt and looked like  a stuffed sausage, plus the arms are ridiculously long and tight.  I know they're supposed to be long because of the thumbholes, but I have many thumbhole shirts that do not fit like this one.  I would have needed at least and XL to fit decent.  Plus the material is like a mid-weight t-shirt - by no means is it a sweatshirt.  Not a bad thing unless you're looking for a sweatshirt, as I was.  Sadly this one went back."
2.0,"Very slick yarn (not cotton), wouldn't stay on."
2.0,"Skirt is darker in person. The fabric surrounding the elastic Waist band ripped on first wear. Fabric is cheap but not see through. Looked so cute in photo, would not purchase again."
2.0,I ride a motorcycle and i bought these to help get through the colder months. My gloves would not heat. I tried two different power banks and still didn't work.
2.0,"I have ordered 2 of these in about 18 months. My first one lasted about 6 months. The second didn‚Äôt even last a month. I teach Kindergarten and wanted a a watch I could attach to my lanyard with my swipe card and ID badge. I really wanted this to work for me, but it simply does not."
2.0,It looked tarnished and so not like the picture - I bought it because of the beautiful words but the bracelet was very disappointing
2.0,I wanted to love this dress and it looks just like the picture which is really cute but it fits rather awkwardly around the bust area. The elastic was too loose and the sizing was off. I couldn‚Äôt make it work so I ended up sending it back.
2.0,The phone pocket screen doesn‚Äôt work half the time & after 2 months the zipper broke! Would not recommend!!
2.0,I love the colors and the quality is pretty good but they did run a bit small which was upsetting. Definitely some spillage. I regret ordering these honestly. I never wear them.
2.0,Zipper messed up right away
2.0,"Bra caused my breasts to immediately break out in hives (which was a first and I‚Äôm over 40) , I suspect because of whatever was sprayed in this or it was soaked in. I noticed it was very strongly scented with what seemed like a lot of febreeze or a very strong scented dryer sheet. It was alarming and miserable.<br />Bra provided  light to medium support but my breasts were too big not to spill into the band. It would have been comfortable still had it not caused the hives and had such an overpowering eye watering scent that caused the hives."
2.0,"I really liked the look and design of these cute bracelets however, the gold color immediately turned a dark brassy color when I got a little water on them while washing my hands.<br />Since I bought them for the gold color, I‚Äôm not liking them anymore."
2.0,Cheap fabric. Very small fit. I returned this.
2.0,"I would like these earrings, but their very small dotted earrings. The picture online is very deceiving as to what you actually get. When I'm wearing these, you can hardly tell I'm even wearing any earrings. Not what I expected nor wanted."
2.0,didn't know they were like a silk material....threw them out...didn't fit right...ugh
2.0,"8 credit cards only, no more.  How many of us have a license, insurance cards, debit card, credit card and a few store cards?  Right...everyone.  This wallet is huge and can fit 20 cards...but the file folio style holder is not big enough to fit more than a card or two if you get lucky in the middle.  Put two cards in each one to get 16 cards today?  No dice, it will break the hinge.<br /><br />Overall, it was disappointing for the price.  I should have saved this money and invested in another nice leather wallet.  Oh...and no, I do not have a Costanza wallet.  I used a small Columbia money clip wallet prior."
2.0,Very stiff fabric.
2.0,"cheaply made, the star looks and feels weird."
2.0,Herringbone fabric separated.<br />Pretty gloves and fit well  but frayed after worn few times.
2.0,"Despite the description that these are &#34;thermal&#34; gloves, they aren't.  When you receive them, the label attached notes that it is rated for &#34;cool&#34; weather...not even cold.  I ordered in white and the gloves looked like polar bear gloves, they are furry, but not warm. I was looking for warm gloves that weren't bulky...my search continues."
2.0,Neckline is way too high
2.0,My initial impression if the shorts was they are nice workout shorts for the price. They are comfortable and seem to be well made.<br /><br />Unfortunately less than a month  after receiving them and only a few washes the zipper stitching separated from the main material as you can see in the pictures.<br /><br />The price is right the quality is questionable. Maybe I have a flawed pair I can be sure. Since the stitching failed after the return period I'm giving 2 stars. If the zipper would have held I would give the shorts 4 stars.
2.0,"Fabric is way to thin, I suggest using in the summer. The fabric is delicate and rips really easy. The good thing is that it is very breathable and easy to pack."
2.0,Nice warm hat...if you are buying this for great sound...don't. Music sounds like it us being funnel through a cup and string..audio from the phone sounds the same. Great idea but the execution leaves a bit to be desired.
2.0,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  She thought they were pretty but cheaply made.  The hooks were starting peel!  I guess what do you expect for around $7.00.  My daughter instead closed the hook and added them to our christmas tree as ornaments.  Do not recommend.
2.0,"Beautiful watch. Unfortunately, it doesn't even keep time for 8 hours without having to be reset."
2.0,"I wanted a plush, oversized shirt for lounging. The fabric on this is kinda thin, also the tag says hand wash. Seriously? I am not gonna hand wash a sweatshirt. So I machine washed and line dried it. Still a disappointment, would not buy again."
2.0,The design is soooo cute and I love the sleeves which makes it so unfortunate that the material is so cheap. I returned this item because it was just so cheap looking and sheer.
2.0,Really poor quality. You get what you pay for with this product. The chain was just garbage; I threw it away and used a chain from another necklace. Really disappointing. The pendant itself is ok but again poor quality. At least the pendant is a little better than the chain.
2.0,Just wanted smaller lenses with a normal frame. This is for children or people with deformed craniums.
2.0,These aren‚Äôt soft or cozy at all.
2.0,They are cute but very cheaply made. They all 4 have broke almost immediately. The piece holding it snapped right off just from natural movement. Im a table games dealer at a casino so it's not like I'm moving too much. Better off using them as decoration than to wear.
2.0,The earrings are really tiny
2.0,I returned them. My friend told me good thing about this shoes but it was weird for me
2.0,It‚Äôs said silver not stainless steel
2.0,"I ordered a red shirt. I got a pinky orange shirt. However, the fit of the shirt is very nice."
2.0,Cute but the sizing is off. My daughter who wears a small can wear the &#34;large&#34; I ordered.
2.0,The black wears off after a while. And I wear it everyday so the sign of use are prevalent. And it fell apart twice
2.0,"I needed this for a trip.  Even though it supposedly prime, it took 5-6 days to be delivered.  I had already left on the trip. I did try it on when I returned. It fit but seemed a smidge on the small size. And I really did not like the material.  Returned."
2.0,This really didn‚Äôt fit right. It was very short and wide. Itchy material.<br />Might work for someone with a shorter torso
2.0,"Really nice, hefty watch, looks more expensive than advertise..however a week after I had it a pin in the band separated the band and watch fell off to hard floor, if tevise can make a better watch band they‚Äôll have a great product"
2.0,the color leaks like crazy!
2.0,"They are okay to use for something not moving.  On your key chains, you are taking a chance on losing your keys, flashlight or whatever you have attached; due the movements the screws become Unscrewed and say goodbye to your items."
2.0,Too short and uns small...cost money to return!
2.0,"Just looks like it's plastic, not sure what I really expected. I ended up prying out the stones and filling the base with enamel."
2.0,I ordered the size my daughter was and she said it was missing the neck ribbon and it was way to big for her she had the hoodie down to her ankles and the socks were to easy to rip bad quality don‚Äôt waste your money
2.0,"The armpits go to the bottom of my bra strap. The idea of a summer shirt is that you don't have to wear a tank top under it. The color is more like ""linoleum around grandpa's toilet"" than what's pictured.  If that's your thing though, have at it. I'll be returning the shirt."
2.0,Fonts on the back were not identical both shirts had two different fonts the words and numbers were not the same but it was ehh ok
2.0,The masks are way too big and Can't adjust it to fit.
2.0,I wear an x large and that's what I got but it was too big.
2.0,Although I like the dress. It looks nothing like the picture. The fabric is a little stiff.
2.0,"Comfortable,  could have went a size smaller"
2.0,"Red fit perfectly, grey was slightly tighter, black if I bent over I'd rip them. All 3 were drastically different in size. I wish I could have kept the red but i returned them all. Save yourself the hassle. One will most likely not fit."
2.0,Not enough slots for the number of cards I need to carry
2.0,Cheaply made. Will not ever wear it.
2.0,The chain is very cheap and broke and I lost the gun and have not found it due to the chain breaking so easy would not recommend this product.
2.0,This item is very poor in the quality
2.0,They were a bit short and the size is like a childrens size
2.0,The dress come ripdby the sides and in the bottom thats the only thing i dont like it
2.0,"This 2 piece set is decent: but it's more like a very thin shirt and leggings. The fabric is extremely thin, and nothing like sweatshirt material. I do feel like it's a little bit misleading - this outfit will not keep you warm at all. Other than that, the set is cute and I like the ribbed texture. Also the dark green color is pretty nice. I just wish it was thicker, more durable material. Overall I give it 2 out of 5 stars."
2.0,Expect to wear an undershirt. Material is thin and see through.
2.0,"Had to return the product twice. I ordered an XL - my general size - but that one was too tight. So I returned it and ordered an XXL - also too tight. Same size, different label. I returned that one and gave up with the company."
2.0,It‚Äôs a very nice pattern<br />But material is cheap<br />It runs small..
2.0,no slit for using the bath room.
2.0,I had the exact same wallet in red that lasted for years.  The zipper broke on this one about a week after I started using it.  Now I can't use it.  Disappointing.
2.0,"Color pretty, leather poor quality. Agree also with review I read, needs more than one piece to hold down long strap."
2.0,"Ring arrived but doesn't have a Batman logo. Instead, it has some kind of silly looking shield image. The description and picture clearly show a Batman logo. False advertising and description and picture. Beware!!!<br /><br />Update: This has happened to another customer also...Transformers logo??? I don't want a Transformers logo when I ordered a Batman logo. SMH"
2.0,"So first of all the size chart of this jacket is WAY OFF! I'm 5'11"" and 160lb, with a 39"" measured chest. I usually wear a 38R jacket size (slim fit). Based on the size chart, I'm squarely a Medium and ordered that size accordingly. When it arrived, it was GIGANTIC. I'd say at least a size 42. The shoulder pads were way beyond my shoulders and the chest was huge on me. I returned the medium and ordered a small (which was it's own hassle that I won't belabor). The small fit me very well in the shoulders and chest. In short, size down one full size from what you would otherwise order.<br /><br />Having gotten the correct size, I like the jacket. The construction feels pretty good, and I like the feel of the fabric.  Don't expect to be awed at this price point, but it's a decent piece. That being said, the item description is not very accurate. It says 50/50 wool/polyester for the fabric content, but the garment tag says it is only 30% wool, so that was disappointing. In addition, the description says this is a ""slim fit"", which I would say is an exaggeration. Even once I got the right size in the chest and shoulders, the waist is definitely looser on me than other slim fit jackets I have from reputable department store brands. It isn't super boxy, but it's not as slim as I'd expect for a ""slim fit""."
2.0,The fabric of this is way too heavy. The bra itself is incredibly heavy and thick.
2.0,Too tight and material is tough.
2.0,I ordered the pink and yellow top. They fit well and are very soft but unfortunately the fabric is see through. I will be returning them.
2.0,"Too big around belly area and too tight around chest area. Might fit someone with a flat chest :/. Fabric is nice, but it just doesn‚Äôt look flattering"
2.0,Band broke after 4 wears.
2.0,Order a size bigger glad I did. Pants wear still a little tight.
2.0,the tail is NOT as appears in the photo and so small as to be basically un-noticable. lame. ears are cute but a bit small for my average size head and gave me a headache after a few hours. wouldn't buy again
2.0,"I got the beautiful green and you could see too many details - not flattering. If the fabric was more like swimsuit fabric, I'd reconsider; but it's close to a summer performancewear Tshirt weight/thickness."
2.0,Low quality very thin plastic and came bent.
2.0,My 17 yo daughter didn't like the fit.  Returned.
2.0,The shirt quality was horrible.  I wore it once or twice and then donated it.
2.0,"Design is cute but the sizing template is waaaaay off the American standard, way off.<br />I normally wear a medium in tops (Large on Amazon). Read the comments and ordered up a size. Large fits like a size Small, no kidding. And the length is short. And the material is thin and shiny ... would not go out to my enclosed patio in this top ... just in case a drone is flying over ... probably put this little number in a clothing drop-box out there, just right for a tiny teen."
2.0,"VERY large neck, so must be worn with collared shirt to look right. Tight fit in the chest."
2.0,Dress looked ok from waist down but the top was gaping open. Too much material. Speaking of the material it is clingy and stretchy and has no real shape.
2.0,So cute but so tight in the arms I couldn‚Äôt even bend my arms for fear of ripping the sleeves.  It fit perfect everywhere else though.  It was weird
2.0,the measurements seemed fine but it‚Äôs too lightweight to crank my large roller shades and need to return.  my old crank handle was sturdier and rigid compared to this one.
2.0,WAY TOO SMALL. Could not return because I was past the return date. Ended up giving it away.
2.0,"The XXL is way too small, be careful when sizing. Otherwise, great style and crafting."
2.0,The vest has nice features but is made out of very cheap cheesy fabric.
2.0,The mask broke in about one hour. The rest of it was cute. Would not recommend
2.0,"I had high expectations for this blouse, but I was really disappointed.  The material is synthetic and very thin.  I have a fairly trim build,  but this top clings to you and really isn't flattering at all.  It fits as expected, but I don't see myself wearing it.  Since returning it from a military address overseas is difficult, I'll just take it as a lesson well learned."
2.0,"Honestly felt like a tight tank top, didn‚Äôt really target those fat areas the way I thought it would."
2.0,For the price I think they are very low quality.  There is glare when using these glasses with the computer.  They also are not very snug and slide down when I bend over.  I'm not returning them out of concern for the Amazon employees who have the work during this COVID-19 pandemic.
2.0,"So I purchased this dress thinking I'd wear it to a dinner, boy was I wrong! As soon as I put it on it was lopsided in the underarm sections. Right underarm was lower than the left, the straps were put at the same lengths, then after seeing it lopsided, I made the straps longer on one side then the other and that didn't work either lol. it doesn't stretch. I'm a 38DD bought XL and not a chance. bust area was tight and not flattering. also it felt and looked like a nightgown. just wish I had taken a photo. it looks pretty online, but what you get is not that. buy at your own risk, just saying!"
2.0,It definitely did not shine like in the pictures.  It is ok üëå.  Just a little dull though
2.0,the jeans are HELLA HELLA LONG and i would also suggest ordering about 2sizes up from your normal jean size.
2.0,"The bra was too small but the top itself was super baggy. If you have a larger chest, this is not for you."
2.0,Show up and fit great felt comfortable and looked nice. Lasted a couple months  before the metal fell of the band and it was unusable.
2.0,The face was nice and the watch came ticking but as far as the band.. the picture doesn't really show it but has one of those cheap looking high gloss leather bands. Granted the watch is $20 it wasn't what my girl friend was looking for so I'm returning it. I think a better price for this watch would be $10 just based on the band. The band would go before the actual watch!
2.0,Never going to order an article of clothing off the internet again. I have to spend $$$ to get this altered to even remotely fit my body.
2.0,2 sizes bigger than a normal size med.
2.0,"I like the concept of this top a lot; however, I noticed that the sleeves were different lengths, so it fits a bit odd."
2.0,unfortunately I was sent a size small.  I ordered a large.  The material seemed thinner than the previous 3 that I have received<br />Pastel by Vivienne Women's A-Line Trapeze Midi Dress in Navy
2.0,"I have a long torso and size DD breasts. This suit is very pretty, nice material, but the top is not supportive at all for chests like mine. If you have small, perky boobs and a short torso, this suit will be perfect on you. The waist is not as high as advertised on me either, which seems to be a common finding. Gonna be a return for me."
2.0,The strap broke right away.  Very dissatisfied!!
2.0,Cute pattern.  Just not for hot weather - they do not cool.
2.0,"The envelope the item was shipped in was damaged, the clear bag the sunglasses were in was damaged, and the sunglasses itself was damaged. The paint was scratched off on the front frame and the sides were cracked."
2.0,"I loved it, just went to wear it for the first time and the zipper is broken. Didn‚Äôt even notice and now it‚Äôs too late to return it."
2.0,"Hello! I love the bracelets that arent bent so I wont be returning them, but I do want anyone thinking of buying these bracelets that they may come bent."
2.0,I like the style but it break the first day I wear it. Wish I can exchange for another one.
2.0,#1 - well made and pretty<br />#2 - cord is short and stiff<br />#3 - glasses get caught and easily fall out
2.0,"Very cheap. It fits smaller than I'd like, and is made of a very thin, cheap looking material."
2.0,Diamond in the middle is very cheap and possibly might fall out. Both earrings were slightly bent.
2.0,"So the purse comes exactly as it looks. I like the color, the room but OMG it smells HORRIBLE inside!!!!! I cant seem to get ride of the horrible smell no matter what I do so I had to go buy another purse. Such a bummer"
2.0,This bra did not give me the back support that I was hoping for.
2.0,Great pendant nut chain turned my neck a rust  color  had to put the pendant on  a diff chain
2.0,"I'm really disappointed.  I love the look,  the feel and the compartments but a few weeks ago,  I noticed the lining is ripping along the seam.  The bag is only 3 months old.  Super disappointed in hobo quality."
2.0,If you read the description it appears the scarf is silk. However when you read the tag on the merchandise informs 100% silk feeling polyester. Not silk as described. Not accurate advertising. Won‚Äôt order from this seller again.
2.0,It's too short. Unflattering.
2.0,It was nice but broke after 3 weeks of wearing it. It was hard to get the links out too. It came on time though
2.0,"not the quality I expected to find should have pooled my money for one more expensive, need to find American made"
2.0,The colors are weird - the green is this drab mint green and it makes the dress look less striking<br /><br />I was hoping for a slip but there is no slip but overall a bit stiff and I'm not thrilled with this dress<br /><br />I suggest to avoid ordering it it doesn't have the same look overall as the picture does
2.0,I love Schitt‚Äôs Creek but this shirt is not great quality and the picture is kinda distorted.
2.0,"The boots are really comfortable, and lightweight it does have steel tote but the slip resistant that it says in the description is false. I slipped just standing near water if it was slip resistant this would be the perfect work boots"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:b65b61941728792649209e6f427fd8bc]] This is not a dress. It is a long strappy blouse. it has a ribbed texture. It has no size to read if it is my size. I will not use this to go out. For the promotional price I orderedThis is not a dress. It is a long strappy blouse. it has a ribbed texture. It has no size to read if it is my size. I will not use this to go out. For the promotional price I ordered I'm going to leave him to sleep because of the thin fabric. It is also too short. I ordered XXL because I like baggy dresses ... But this stayed below my navel like a T-shirt.
2.0,"Low quality products: goggles and cap get water immediately after start swimming, not a buy."
2.0,The charm was smaller them it looked on pic.
2.0,Very flimsy and cheaply
2.0,"Product is extremely small, I wear an XL on a regular basis and I couldn't even get my arms into these shirts."
2.0,Very small. They are too tight on my head and I have a normal sized head
2.0,The thin &#34;branches&#34; will not hold any of my cuff bracelets and it falls over a lot. cute to look at though.
2.0,"Very cute, but the chain comes undone easily. I almost lost my house key because it broke off my key ring"
2.0,Super cute and I loved it but after two wears the sides began to fray and fall apart and I can't wear it anymore. :(
2.0,I didn‚Äôt like that it didn‚Äôt have the loop like the other bands
2.0,This is one of the most unflattering dresses I've ever tried. It's pretty straight up and down and not flowy like I thought it was going to be based on model photo. It made me look like a tree trunk. I can't imagine it working for anyone with any curves?
2.0,"I love the sunglasses but when I received them, they had this small scratches on the left eye. It's not that noticeable since it's close to the nose."
2.0,"Ladies.....if you are looking for a nice looking bag with supple leather and comfortable straps, this is not the bag for you.  I really like American West, normally.  But this bag is cheaply made...the zippers do not glide at all, for one.  For two, the leather is thin, and for three, the straps are scratchy and uncomfortable for hand held or over the shoulder.  The bag completely misses the mark for a ""carry bag"".  I will have to say that if you like the depiction of the color, it is spot on.  This is one of those purchases for me that I wished I would have been able to try it on for size first."
2.0,It was a gift for a friend. But there are times where it doesn't turn. It sticks...
2.0,Hat was too large.
2.0,Wouldn't  order again the metal wire that the cuffs were made up out of is crappy. Very bendy and does not retain shape really well.
2.0,"Great concept, however the letters are so large, you can barely read them when worn as advertised. I never give negative reviews, but they should consider decreasing the size of the text by half in order to be displayed properly. The letters are like 3 1/2 to 4 inches tall and about an inch apart. This would be a perfect size for a tee shirt, but not for a face covering."
2.0,"Was disappointed with the size. Felt more like maybe a large, not a 2x. Couldn't get it over my shoulders."
2.0,Not even close to the size it said it would be.  I normally wear a 10-12 in Women so I ordered a Large... my daughter<br />who wears a size 0-2 women was barely able to fit into the swim suit.  It's as if they sent a CHILDREN'S size Large.
2.0,"Before ordering I measured both calves to make sure they would fit. Unfortunately, the 26-inch size was not true to fit. My calves were 21 and 22 inches. Sadly I had them on while flying and could not get them off. As a result, I have some scars from where they were digging into my leg. Maybe one should order a size larger."
2.0,My wife got this for Halloween and the torso portion didn‚Äôt match the legs and other parts included in it.  The crown mask included was also not a high quality to match the actual character outfit
2.0,These are nice for a few weeks.  Then they begin to leak all over from the nozzle.
2.0,"Serves its purpose, i.e., to hang my daughter's hair accessories but, it is cheaply made."
2.0,"These Argyll socks were smaller than I expected based on my earlier purchase of the same brand of socks in blue/black pinstripe, which fit securely over my calf.  Unfortunately, the Argyll socks don't stretch that far.  I have to pull them up frequently because they fall down my ankles."
2.0,I'm only 5'5&#34; and the legs were far too short.
2.0,"This jacket is very thin, and way smaller than stated sizes... ON the plus side, it is very soft"
2.0,"Loved the way this looked on the model, but not on me.  Sleeves are very weird, looked matronly.  Returning."
2.0,"The watch was cute enough, but the pin holding the clasp to the band dislodged.  It isn't an expensive watch, but it should hold up for longer than 2 months."
2.0,"Think cute, stuffed sausage!  I normally wear an XL.  This is an XXL and I can‚Äôt breathe.  Too sheer as well.  I‚Äôm returning it!"
2.0,"Seems like old fashioned Polyester, no tag to specify fabric content. Painted design was most likely not fully dried and caused parts of shirt to be stuck together though minimal damage to the design occurred. I bought this to reach the free shipping minimum, I might have bought something else had I known about the quality."
2.0,"Runs very, very small. I normally wear a large/xl in typical brands like at Banana Republic or Gap. I ended up giving the XL to a friend who is a standard s/m and she said it was perfect. This is probably made in Asian sizing, sadly. When I travel to Asia, typically the sizing is just tiny... I would have to go into a 3-4x because either it is short in length or way too small all around. Too bad.... I give it a star for at least being pretty."
2.0,"the picture is incredibly deceiving, this is a pretty average purse. I bought it, looking for a large sized purse/beach bag style. Something I could get multiple uses out of. But this is pretty average sized and I'm a bit disappointed."
2.0,"I was SO excited to get these because I had a pair several years ago that were amazing...sadly I was disappointed this time. The fabric was not soft inside and the fit was definitely tight (I recommend sizing up if you choose to buy these). Also, they developed holes in the fabric on my bum, near the seam at the top of my thigh area after I had worn them only 3 or 4 times. The only plus was they do look like jeans and they have real pockets."
2.0,"Color was a really pale peach, not coral like the image.  Good coverage. Fabric wrinkles easily."
2.0,"The gloves are confortable and will keep your hands warm in the below freezing temperatures with no problem. The real problem is that these are basically small fit. Almost as if they are intended for women and not men. I know because I have smaller hands than the average man and they were still a little small, which ads the question; why isn't there a size option in the page? I will use them anyways as its cold outside and I cant afford to yet go another day without protection from the cold. If you are 5'7 and below these will &#34;probably&#34; fit you fine!"
2.0,"Got these slippers for my husband for Xmas 2016....now its exactly one month later, slipper VERY comfortable but unfortunately the entire side of the left slipper is coming undone, the fabric is actually coming out of the sole of shoe where fabric and sole meet....waste of money!!"
2.0,"This is a super sweet dress, BUT I am a huge cotton supporter. I never purchase clothes that have polyester in them. The description of this dress says 100% cotton, so untrue!!!  And I purchased for a baby shower gift!!! So unhappy right now."
2.0,It's like a tent. Not flattering
2.0,Weird length. Had to cut it down because it was too short to wrap 4 times and too long To only wrap 3 times. Cute but cheaply made.
2.0,Got this for my girlfriend and after not even a week of wearing it it turned her skin green. Thought this was supposed to be sterling silver. Not very satisfied at all.
2.0,It's very sheer and runs at least one size small. Will make a good swimsuit cover up.
2.0,I don‚Äôt like the type of material and don‚Äôt like the look of it. It isn‚Äôt very flattering to your figure and it wrinkles.
2.0,The color is spotted. The earrings are nice but two of the three are not evenly distributed spots I can‚Äôt smooth out.
2.0,Unable to wear these jeans Way too large. I expected them to fit like my other  two pair.
2.0,Fit large across the bustline.  Also looked a bit cheezy.  I did not like it!
2.0,"The black fabric is thin and flowy, very comfortable but also very sheer. Impossible to wear this without another top under it. For me, that diminished the comfort somewhat. I wouldn't purchase this item again, especially not for 20 dollars."
2.0,The dress was very nice; however I ordered a small and they sent a large.  It was way too big.
2.0,smaller than the size I ordered
2.0,It‚Äôs like carrying a brick in your back pocket. Super thick!
2.0,"I am 5'8"", 175, and 36DD. Dress fits great everywhere, but it is WAY too short. Not even an attempt at being long enough."
2.0,"Blisters on the way, they rub in back, buy little bigger and wear sox"
2.0,I've ordered this brand before and loved them.  This style didn't fit right.  Waist was way too tight and everything below that was too loose.
2.0,"its good , but as i have broad shoulders , It makes me look even more big ."
2.0,"The hat arrived early, but unfortunately is rather small. It was advertised as one size fits all, but is a small/medium. It barely fits and is tight on my head. Other than that it is not a bad product"
2.0,The material is so super thin where the snaps are on the tail it rips when you try to unsnap it!!!! But it‚Äôs cute and my daughter was thrilled
2.0,"Cuando lo ordene cre√≠a que las letras iban a estar cocidas a ca cachucha, simplemente las pegaron con silic√≥n."
2.0,"I bought these about 2 months ago and they were great when I first got them. Fit nice, look nice. However in the past month the screws at the joints have come out 3 times. I was not rough with them by any means. I stored them in the sunglasses compartment in my car and I would pull them up and it would simply come apart in 3 pieces. I have been able to fix them but they just fall apart again."
2.0,Not as long as I thought
2.0,"I was looking for something to cover my bare arms when i am on road trips wearing a sleeveless shirt. This is not it. Though they are well made and designed, they are not long enough to cover the entire arm. My arms are short (i am 5 ft. 1‚Äù) and the sleeve doesn‚Äôt cover the top part of my arm up to my shoulder. For tall people it would only cover the elbows. I will try the men‚Äôs size."
2.0,"This not a cotton sleep shirt. The material isn't so bad but its really small, I even went up a size. It's like a tank top which I wanted just hoping it would actual cover my butt and not just reach the middle of it. I did not return it cause it was cheap"
2.0,Material is VERY thin!!!! You can see straight through it
2.0,"This dress looks so pretty in the picture. In reality, the waist is much higher on it. The overall dress is not attractive. The proportions are weird. I wasnt happy with it!"
2.0,I love the eye brow earrings but they don‚Äôt glow in the dark smh
2.0,"The fit of this dress is great and the pattern was exactly as expected, but I can‚Äôt get over how cheap the fabric is. This feels like the material that would be used for a Barbie doll, and the fabric smells like plastic. Also the buttons are sewn shut so they don‚Äôt open. Overall quality is very poor, definitely not worth the $20."
2.0,The colors not the same as shown. Would not have bought this if I knew it was this color. it is soft just ugly
2.0,The style is what I was looking for but the black pair was worn on back thigh area. There was piling. The other pair (gray) are fine.
2.0,Extremely see through and shows every crease... used for a Halloween Winnie the Pooh costume. I had to wear maternity leggings underneath
2.0,The top was too short. Like a crop top almost. Not as pictured. Nice fabric. But had to return.
2.0,"Now after wearing if for some time I feel a little bit disappointed with it. So for starters as you see it hangs upside-down which makes the claw point up, and at first glance you wouldn't think that is a problem, but let me tell you, IT REALLY IS. I'm sure if youre buying this its because youre not going to take it off for a long time, and everything single day the claw just kept hooking on EVERYTHING and snapping the somewhat cheap chain, so everyday I would have to fix the chain... it would hook on my towels when I would dry off after the shower, the edge of the table if I had to pick something up, it would hook on my wife's hair every time she came near me....I mean at least 5 times a day it would get snagged on something and it got to be very irritating. I'm a carpenter myself and I cant even begin to tell you how many times it got hooked on decks or projects I was working on, and either snapped off completely or just hurt my next from getting hooked and stopping me dead in my tracks. when you search for the &#34;hammer urn necklace&#34; you'll notice two different ones, this one and one that all silver the hangs from the chain at the top.  I initially got this one as opposed to the one that was all silver because I liked the black handle, but I just bought the all silver one instead and since it hangs normally, with the claw down, as I expected, that subtle difference has prevented it from hooking on anything. also that all silver necklace came in a beautiful jewelry box, with a much nicer ash adding kit with it and you don't even need a tool to get the cap screwed on since its connected to the chain ring. the best part is that the other one is about 5 dollars LESS than this one and the hammer it self is just as heavy and solid. so trust me, if you plan on wearing this necklace all the time, buy the other one, save a few bucks, and ALOT of irritation and potentially loosing your loved ones ashes.  all in all I would ABSOLUTLY buy the other one instead, save your time and don't get this one, you'll find yourself buying the other one soon anyway."
2.0,It broke 2 days after use. The wites broke off from the battery.
2.0,Product broke as I put on my arm. Product looks great just not durable enough
2.0,"Nice material, but the size guide is off. I would order one size lzrger."
2.0,I didn't like fir or color...<br />I haven't used but I was going to wear to it to a baby shower but I didn't due to wrong color and fit.
2.0,Had a hole in the slipper that needed to be sewed.
2.0,It is entirely too small I basically suffocated putting it on and I had to immediately take it off because of how tight it was. Other than that everything looks exactly like the photo I‚Äôm going to re-order it again in a two XL. Just wish they got the sizing right.
2.0,"They were fine for the most part, but didn't actually fit over my glasses, which was the whole reason I bought them! This is the smaller size, so the lenses didn't fit, but even the arms of the glasses don't fit, which are the same on both sizes. I went with the Theraspecs instead, which seem to actually fit."
2.0,"Only gave it 2 stars bc the beanies are ok, picture described a grey confetti and I received a navy blue which I don‚Äôt like but the white one is nice it just took forever to get to me and I have prime it should of been here in the 2 days promised disappointed with that bc I needed it for the cold weekend and it wasn‚Äôt here!!"
2.0,Cheap materials and you get what you paid for
2.0,I was so disappointed in this dress. Returning because the chest/ neck area was HUGE. The fabric was stiff and not what I expected also. The chest/ neck/ shoulders area was big and gathered really awkwardly. I could not move my arms without the entire chest area shifting upwards creating a larger gather in fabric.
2.0,"The pants were poor quality, not like the ones I purchased last year from Zumba.com.<br />Was very disappointed in the fabric."
2.0,"This was beautiful out of the box, but 2 months later, all but one stone remains."
2.0,"Love the glasses, but the screw on one side came out 2 weeks after I received them.  So, now I can't wear them anymore."
2.0,Snaps and pocket hardware are either super cheap or defective. I hadn't even washed these shorts yet and a pocket snap came off with the entire snap head the 1st time i tried to unsnap the pocket and another one of the hardware pieces broke off when i took the shorts off.  CHEAP as in low quality!
2.0,Cheap fabric and picture on outfit is crap
2.0,I really like the frames and the way they fit.. but I can‚Äôt see out of them way to dark!!!!! I have to take them off to see my phone! When driving I can‚Äôt see the dashboard! To dangerous driving! Way to dark!
2.0,did not light up well in day time
2.0,"Terrible. Itchy, poorly made, not as pictured and the waist sits at such a weird spot. Also, the smell was horrendous."
2.0,It didn't fit like I thought it would
2.0,Smaller than expected and the fabric is lighter that I had hoped.
2.0,"I usually wear size medium, you name it, from Mechanix, Blackhawk, 5.11, Hatch or Oakley. Ordered a pair of medium of these and they are the weirdest gloves I have ever tried specially at the tip of the thumb. All finger tips were already 1/2 inch longer than other brands but the thumb was 3/4 inch longer! Not sure if this is their design or factory defect. Found the small one on SKD tactical because Amazon was not offering it in that size and the thumb is about 5/8 longer than the tip of my finger. I would say they are not worth $29 nor functional but they are ok."
2.0,"I really liked this suit, unfortunately the pink colour ran, transferring colour on to everything it cane in contact with."
2.0,Sent back. Was not flattering on me. Would look better on a slim figure
2.0,You get what you pay for. Cheaply made. Short in the arms and baggy everywhere else. Took three and a half weeks to arrive.
2.0,Tiny stones fell out after a week of wear<br /><br />Nice locking backs though
2.0,"I could not wear this too, sagged Uber the arm to show my whole side, just didn‚Äôt look right"
2.0,To big for my daughter. Its a small said it's size 7 to 8 but it's bigger than that.
2.0,"Ill fitting, neck too wide, overall a little large. A disappointment. I use it as a nightgown sometimes."
2.0,"Honestly it‚Äôs a beautiful bracelet, nice weight, & fit me perfectly. BUT it honestly made me so anxious. I felt very overwhelmed wearing it and I was expecting a different reaction. Guess it just wasn‚Äôt for me."
2.0,Pretty but it had some broken parts of the dres not good quality
2.0,This mask was a gift. The recipient loved the subject matter but complained about the size. It was too small.
2.0,"Looks cheap, like something I could make at home."
2.0,The dress is way to short for a dress.
2.0,Tks.
2.0,"These shoes are going to the homeless. They hurt the bottom of my feet, and way too spongy. Didn‚Äôt give enough support. Of course you never know how shoes feel until you wear them a few times."
2.0,"Weird material, very stretchy."
2.0,"Had to return. Runs significantly small, at least for XL size persons. It fit, quite literally, like a glove. You know the meme about getting stuck in a dress in a dressing room? I wasn't sure I was going to get out of this on my own. Cute shirt, seemed to be good quality. I received a different shirt of this same brand at Christmas in XL & it fits just fine. So maybe quality control just sucks."
2.0,"This morning I would have to say I am disappointed with the stitching was a little frazzled and it was too small and did not at all go past my waist, like I had hoped. I would say ordering a XL would probably have fit someone correctly if they are truly a small. Im 250lbs 5'6"
2.0,"Makes my wrist itch from the holes pressing on the skin, irritating and not a comfortable fit at all."
2.0,"Retains a lot of heat and is well made, BUT it is WAAAAAAY to big and not practical for use. See the pictures from other reviews. Cannot use when sleeping; if you roll over it will cover your face."
2.0,Beautiful design but broke in 2 weeks
2.0,"So, I scoured the internet for a great shaped bowler, I‚Äôm very picky about crown height, brim size and hat shape, but I didn‚Äôt find much that was affordable. When I found this hat I jumped on it because it was the exact shape and style I wanted at a price I could afford. I should have been more discerning. The hat is great as a costume piece, with care it could last a long time. Just don‚Äôt use it as an actual hat. I wore mine for two weeks and loved it. It‚Äôs comfy, warm, and it looks great. Until it rained on me at work. 100% wool is going to shrink. It‚Äôs not pretreated. It‚Äôs not scotch guarded or lacquered or anything. It failed as a hat."
2.0,"Cheaply made, the material is like a wet suit, if you tried to wear it in the water it would probably disintegrate because of how the elastic is sewn and it doesn‚Äôt look like the picture, it‚Äôs reversible though"
2.0,Too much material for me!
2.0,"So tired of how cute the clothes look on the size 000 models, then you get it home and it looks like garbage, and I'm not exactly big. Ordered up a size for baggy look and it was just sloppy."
2.0,"Bought 2xl... wear 2xl in dress, 16-18 pants and am 40D. This dress is not for big breasts and big bellies. Way too tight around the upper waist. The neck style is not flattering for big breast. Looks nice, but does not feel comfortable. Material is stretchy. Grace Karin has some work to do on accommodating bigger sizes. Her stresses seem to always fit tight on the waist. Gave several of her dresses a try and all failed to fit properly. Not going to purchase again."
2.0,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù average build and a large in shirts due to a slightly large bust (37D.) I received this for Christmas in size large. The sleeves are 3/4 length, not at all like the pictures. And this does not even remotely go off-shoulder. I requested it for Christmas to have a look like the pictures and I‚Äôm very disappointed."
2.0,These shorts look totally fine but the Fabric quality is pretty poor/cheap. Not lined so a bit see-through. I also don‚Äôt get the sense they‚Äôll hold up well.
2.0,"Casio China, not original manufacturer from Casio Indonesia.<br /><br />Specific differences include the depth of the lengthwise relief on the new band is less. As the bale shape's curve is also different, sharper on the replacement.  Further, the design element holes near the watch face are not uniform in depth like the original, rather they taper. Instead of a flat, they end up like a dish, they are smaller too.<br /><br />The material is different as noted previously, not as flexible as the original.  I can bend my original band lengthwise in half without feeling likes it going to split, the replacement feels as though it won't do it often before failing.<br /><br />The markings on the band of my original are 444, F2, 16.  The replacement has 444, FB116, PUR.<br /><br />Will it work? Probably, but its not exactly as original. For the price, it's headed back.<br /><br />Note: While I ordered the item from ""The Watchband Store"", the items I received was from ""JS Leatherworks"", so it may be this vendor can supply the right item.  I guess I'll find out, when I do, I'll update my review."
2.0,"If these didn‚Äôt pinch my head giving me a headache , they would be perfect. They pinch about 5x more than normal glasses"
2.0,"I didn't care for this item. It was poorly made and it doesn't travel well, which is the whole purpose of purchasing this style."
2.0,"Bought this for my 8 year olds new quad he got for his baptism. It was an extremely tight fit to get it zipped, and the zipper broke the third time we used it. Will be purchasing something else."
2.0,Wallet was ok...but the zipper is not working that well and the leather is peeled a bit in a few spots. But I didn't either bother to request an even exchange.
2.0,"The glasses are lightweight and fit nicely. However, there is a design issue with the lenses. In the frame the lenses create a V shape and angle down towards the nose. The polarization follows the same angle of the lenses creating different polarized views for each eye. This means you will see glare is one eye that you won't see in the other eye and vice versa.<br /><br />I ordered two pairs and both are the same way."
2.0,Cheap food handling gloves. Took over 2 months to ship from China. Gloves are too short  so it won't cover the hand entirety
2.0,This looks beautiful but the material is very thin and I do ot like the thinness.<br />I wish it was made better.  I kept it but have not worn it. Sorry
2.0,Like design. Don‚Äôt like that bracelet lock is the worst I‚Äôve ever had before. Honestly I was wearing this bracelet for only two days and I lost it because of this bad lock. The last thing I think it‚Äôs overpriced for that poor quality. So disappointed.
2.0,Not what I expected.  Bottom to thin
2.0,They fit but were not durable.  These were pretty much disposable socks.  Would not buy again.
2.0,"While I do like the rugged and worn look of these cut off jeans, I have to say that they run very big. Bigger than I expected, to the point where they are unwearable. My girlfriend is 5‚Äô7, 105 lbs., and we ordered her a small, as this is the size she normally wears. To give you an idea of how big these run, If she wanted to, she probably would have been able to fit two of her legs into one of the leg holes.<br /><br />This is inconsistent with other clothing from Chinese companies I have purchased, as asian frames tend to run smaller than American frames, meaning you normally have to order a size up. For this pair of shorts specifically, I would recommend doing the opposite. If you are bigger, order your normal size. If you are on the skinnier side, order a size down! I know this seems counter intuitive, but you‚Äôll just have to trust me on this one.<br /><br />I definitely do like the style of these cut offs, but I would state that unless you are on the heavier side, these probably will be somewhat big on you.<br /><br />This product was sent to me for free by the manufacturer for evaluative purposes. All opinions are honest and my own."
2.0,It broke at the 3rd time I wore it.
2.0,"These pants are cheaply made & fit oddly. I gave it a two stars because the pattern is cute, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them."
2.0,After roughly 3 years the belt split at the end for roughly 3 inches. No refund or worse no offer to simply fix. Have other belts similar in material and cost that have lasted 10 years. Oh well live and learn
2.0,At first I loved them! But the littlest amount of water touched the shoes and they never worked again..
2.0,I listened to the reviews and took a chance against my better judgment. I am taking a long flight so I thought this looked like a comfy option...nope. The length was good for a short gal like me 5'3 but I am a xl/14-16 and most of it is in my butt &amp; tummy. This jumper went on fine but it was not at all comfortable nor did it fit well on my body. If you had a tighter body with some imperfections you can pull it off...it will be going straight back!
2.0,This shirt fits well but is made of flimsy materials. It is a black and light grey verses black and white.
2.0,Not what I expected but it ok hard to operate
2.0,they turn your finger green within the hour!
2.0,Beautiful! I got the rose gold. It's definitely blingy but I love it!! I adjusted it with a scissor tip. Not difficult at all.<br />edit now Ive had this watch for over a month and it keeps coming undone and falling off. Im afraid Im going to lose it. Too late to return now though. Had to bring 5 star down because of this. I do still love the watch though!
2.0,it is cute but runs very small
2.0,Decent quality for the price but these are not two tone like the picture shows. They are all red.
2.0,Too small for my eyeglasses.  Poor description of product.
2.0,In the mailing box contained two pair (which I ordered for my grandchildren) only wrapped in a plastic bag.  No shoe box.  Hard to wrap for a gift and it was hard to convince them they really were stompeez.
2.0,CHEap Payless shoes
2.0,This charm is very small next to pandora charms and looks like very cheap plastic.
2.0,When I received this robe I noticed that there were stands of the material<br />coming out.  After one wear and one wash the seam in the shoulder opened up. I sewed it. After another wear and wash the side seam ripped open. I will now have to reinforce all the seams.
2.0,It was super cute but it only lasted about a week it broke way too easily
2.0,"I'm 5' 0 116lbs, Ordered a medium, and the fit was a little snugger than I liked. I wanted to exchange for a large and they sent me the wrong color bathing suit.... Twice. Ended up returning and waiting on my credit..."
2.0,Had to return it.. the arm holes were too big.
2.0,"I love the look of this watch but after a month of using it, I find the self winding mechanism is quite poor. It doesn‚Äôt seem to provide more than a few hours of power reserve and it doesn‚Äôt really hand wind. I wake up in the morning and the watch has stopped even after a full day of wear. It‚Äôsa nice dress watch, but over priced"
2.0,After I wore them a few times one of the crosses fell off and I had to super glue it. Other than that I like them & also the cross earrings that were with them.
2.0,"Looks nice, but it wasnt too warm"
2.0,"I love the look; however, the inside of the sweater sheds on whatever is worn underneath."
2.0,The product is completely different than it's expected but it's still a cute dress.
2.0,"1.5 STARS<br />Nothing special, just go to a skate shop or the mall. You'll have better luck."
2.0,The fit is not good they are way to wide. They squeak when walked in and just not comfortable.
2.0,Poor quality necklace.
2.0,When I just got this it looked cool and was ok but after having this around two months the leather part was ripped<br />Low quality
2.0,"Zipper doesn't go up the entire back of pants and stops at bottom of the waistband, after which they are fastened by a cheap, badly sewn in hook. This makes zero sense because even if you replace the hook and add a few more you've always got a fabric gap in the back of the pants, which destroys the hip slenderizing look of the elongated waistline and makes the pants look like the cheap Amazon buy that they actually are lol. Such a shame because if they had zipped up fully they would have been a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. *sigh*"
2.0,It was huge & really puffy. I'm 5'1 so it looked ridiculous. The color also looks very different from the photo
2.0,"This strap lasted almost 3 months. The screws eventually pulled through just with normal wear. The strap was slightly wider than the original also, but much much stiffer."
2.0,Good quality. Runs a little small thought.
2.0,Eh!  It's definitely good for easy wear at the beach.
2.0,"Much, much smaller than I realized or expected."
2.0,The ring so nice but for awhile I was wearing it and it change the color!!! So I was disappointed!!
2.0,"I was pretty unhappy due to the fact that just about half of the lights were either very dim or did not work at all.  Had a lot of unhappy kids the other night. For the ones that did work, they were amazing."
2.0,The material isn‚Äôt strong. Very easy to rip in my opinion. Gives a cheap look.
2.0,Runs small completely see thru it seems more like a slip then a dress and the adjustment straps were sewn so u cud not adjust it was given half my money and told give it to someone else
2.0,"Very thin and light, almost too thin. The stems feel like they will snap or at least bend very easily. They almost feel like a heavy craft wire.<br /><br />They do make things darker and easier to look at and are more than likely polarized. They are fine as an extra pair of sunglasses but are definitely not worth the money.  They are just too brittle feeling."
2.0,I was disappointed in this dress.  It did not fit like it was pictured.  I was expecting a more fitted look.
2.0,I found the SLS3 to be too long.  It came up onto my knee and pinched.  Too bad because the product seemed very nice.
2.0,Tarnished really bad when it got wet. Didn't last very long.
2.0,"Hated them. I should have returned them when I had the chance. Material shows my fat. Which other leggings don‚Äôt, like my cellulite. They look like spandexy if you know what I mean. The sides where the mesh is, ripped in a few spots already."
2.0,I'm a 32D and ordered a large. I couldn't even pull the zipper to touch.
2.0,"They look pretty chinsy. 1 is glittery and little girl like. 1 looks like something from the 80's.<br />I've been wearing the teal 1 and after 2 weeks, it's already stretched out & rippley.<br />They weren't expensive, but I did expect it to last longer than 2 weeks."
2.0,"While I loved the dress, mine came with sleeves.  This actually worked out better for me so I kept it but that isn‚Äôt what I ordered."
2.0,Can‚Äôt get them to be leakproof or fog resistant.  I have to constantly adjust them while swimming since water leaks in.
2.0,"I liked it fairly well, but the zipper came off the rails the second time I carried it."
2.0,couldn t send it back
2.0,Colors not as vibrant as pictured. Thin material runs short on lenght
2.0,Made of slick material that does not stay in nose area
2.0,"material was plastic like,  disappointed but kept it colors are nice.  for one day at the school cafeteria it will be ok.  Butt i will be careful what i order from know on."
2.0,This item is very nice and very small.  It will work well for a charm bracelet or a petite woman or small child.  It is between the size of a dime and a penny and extremely thin.  It is more of a charm than a pendant.
2.0,Was very nice and my son was happy with it but the clasp just fell apart and now it has to be thrown away.
2.0,"I'm giving this 2 stars because the only good thing with these was a fast delivery. I really hoped these were going to work out but they are thin, runs small and smells. I didn't wanted to waste time in returning them so I gave them to my friend who she can fit in them. You have to wash them twice at least before you wear them to get rid of a funky smell. They are really thin so you can't wear them over jean. Save your money"
2.0,"Vision is blurred from the low quality lens, looks smeared all the time, creaky material, though frame is somewhat cute once they are on."
2.0,"Fit is very good, color is way off. The ""blue"" and ""green"" aren't even close to what they are represented as advertised."
2.0,Material is really thin.  Almost see through.
2.0,"Looks like a really cute dress. The top is a really soft knit and there is no zipper.  The skirt and waistband are made out a taffeta fabric with no stretch. However, the woman‚Äôs XL is more like a medium. I was very disappointed since I usually wear a large or XL and couldn‚Äôt even get into this dress as there is no zipper. I really wish that they made the woman‚Äôs dress in a 3 or 4 XL as I think that would be the equivalent of a regular XL."
2.0,The lens are very flimsy
2.0,I did not like this dress.
2.0,"This could make a cute top, but not a dress. üôà"
2.0,The thickness and quality of the gold ring are perfect. Nice thickness. However both these rings should be the same quality. The silver one is thinner and flimsy. Disappointed.
2.0,Runs SMALL
2.0,These were great for a few weeks. The shoe laces started to unravel and became pretty much twine after a six or so week use. I noticed the shoes started wearing  down quick after my vigorous biweekley treck DOWN THE STREET to 7/11. This morning I was putting on one of the shoes looked at the bottom squeezed the sides and THE ENTIRE BOTTOM TORE APART DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
2.0,Very short and will need to return
2.0,material is itchy and scratchy. Cheap l but was expensive. I have not worn it yet. would return but shipping would cost more than the item I think.
2.0,Pictures show white/grey color... actually beige/black. Returned.
2.0,"Meh, threse aren't heavy enough to stretch ears, but yet they aren't the right size. I orded a 2guage, but I think I got a 4/6 guage because my holes got smaller and then I had to restretch my ears"
2.0,beautiful but break very easily
2.0,"Nos what I expected. Very thin, not soft. Returned it."
2.0,"Pretty when it hits the light just right, but the sizing is way off! Used the size chart to match my pointer finger, and it runs way big and falls off my finger.... very sad I can't even wear it"
2.0,Cheep product
2.0,"These absolutely do not stretch much.  Not as good as other neck gaiters I have ordered.  I really dont like them, would return them if my kids hadn't opened all of them."
2.0,It's a beautiful dress but I ordered an xtra xtra Large and it fits my daughter who wears an 8.
2.0,"Just fair, tight fit"
2.0,"Dress appears to be relaxed fit, loose at the bottom. Dress is more fitted and much longer than it appears."
2.0,First vest didn‚Äôt work. Sent it back got the replacement vest supposed to be same size but was much smaller then the first one.
2.0,While product seemed well made they are sized very slim and even XL does not fit my size M American thighs so I had to return them.
2.0,Can‚Äôt read names or personalized msg right is entirely to small for all the detail
2.0,Doesn't have the weight normally accustomed to for stainless/Sterling Silver...
2.0,"While these looked like an awesome bargain, don't be deceived.  They ship all the way from China!  Plus, the construction is average with very average quality fabrics."
2.0,"This item advertised as an ""On demand shower heater"" would not heat water above luke warm .  Too cold to shower under.  I would have returned the item, but the return time had passed by the time I could install it."
2.0,Did not fit and was not true to size. I returned this item
2.0,It's cheap. But doable... (meh).
2.0,"Ok, so I've ordered several different things from this brand, and I love all of them except these harem shorts. The waist is much smaller than I expected (I am 5'4"" and an overweight 180lbs). I was just looking for a comfortable pair of shorts to lounge around in. Dont get me wrong,, they are very soft, but the fit is just weird. Maybe I got a dud- there are stains on them and some of the stitching is off.  A little disappointed as I love all the leggings I got from them. In the photo bottom geometric leggings in XL, Galaxy capri leggings in Large, Harem shorts in XL."
2.0,"So much for rust brown. More like ORANGE. Also, much too long on me."
2.0,"Needed 2 sizes up. Nice dress, but I had to return."
2.0,Comfortable? Yes. Ugly? Also yes. My husband said I looked like an Amish person. Not exactly the goal. If you are taller perhaps this looks better? I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù.
2.0,It‚Äôs cute but the onesie stretches out after a wear or two.
2.0,I loved this sweater until the seem came out of the sleeve and completely unraveled in the washer
2.0,"This company really needs to get their sizing right, because then they'd have a pretty good sports bra. The sizing is so off, that it makes no sense and I'm a woman who knows my bust and cup size. I am a 32DD or 34D. I wear my bras on the loosest hook and then tighten as the bra stretches out over time. Textboook.<br /> I ordered a 34DD in the blue/yellow and it fit like a 30C. No joke. No bounce either, but this bra would be KILLING by the end of the day and through my shirt I'm sure you could see the bulges under my shoulders. I am 5'6&#34;, 135 and engage in horseback riding, Zumba, cross fit, hiking and Turbokick. I would try a 36DD for the value or even a 38DD...or just go to Ross or Nordstrom Rack where I can try them on!"
2.0,There are tools on the market that are much better
2.0,too loose and cheap fabric. it doesn't sculpt your body the way it should.
2.0,I was so excited to get these but they fit too big. Definitely not a tummy control. Didn‚Äôt look so flattering :(
2.0,"Sweater was great until I washed it, then it shrank.... a lot! :("
2.0,Glasses are ok. I mainly bought this because it stated a carry case was included (keyword CASE) instead it comes with a cheap sack/bag with a drawstring.  Very disappointed.
2.0,The springs are terrible and 2 of 4 wouldn't stay in place. They are also too large to be for the nose.
2.0,"Needs to be minimum ~1/2‚Äù taller (top to bottom length). Fits ok with mouth closed, but open mouth to breath or talk, and mask pulls down exposing nose. So if 1/2‚Äù-5/8‚Äù taller, then would fit perfect.<br /><br />Also, in comparison to similar product I bought retail at brick & mortar pharmacy, the ear loop fabric is a bit rough on the ears. You don‚Äôt feel it right away, but after 2-3hrs of wear, and you can really feel irritation behind/around ears.<br /><br />Because they don‚Äôt fit me and because ear irritation I can only give these 2-stars overall."
2.0,I am 5ft 2 and this dress was too long! It fit me down to my calfs...smh...
2.0,"Fabric is not soft, it's very synthetic super scratchy feeling. Model is likely wearing at least one size too big. Colors are no where near as vibrant as pictured."
2.0,The tights are very small and didnt fit right.
2.0,"Twelve eggs shipped, and 11 survived packaging. One of the eggs was broken upon arrival despite no apparent damage to box. Company claimed it was the shippers fault and offered no sympathy. I'm thinking it was due to the poor packing technique. Eggs were covered in excessive plastic wrap and shipping box was full of chopped newspaper to protect shipment, but the eggs were not in the middle of the package? After 14 days in the incubator, three were determined to be not fertile. Four hatched on day 16, and the remaining four did not hatch. A 25% hatch rate is not acceptable. The current price is too high to be a return customer. I will add that the quail that did hatch are incredibly adorable, so that's a plus."
2.0,"I had no idea that I was purchasing a skinny tie.  I have never worn a skinny tie, and I will probably stick this one in the bag I am carrying to Goodwill.  It is beautiful, but its width ruins it for me."
2.0,The large is a small
2.0,"I absolutely loved this watch the second I opened it. That is, until it stopped telling time before I even wore it the first time and then the bar fell out causing the strap to break rendering the watch useless to tell time and even to wear. Other than the fact that mine fell apart I loved it. It is a shame my boyfriend tried to fix it and then lost the bar so I remain hopeful all is not lost and I can return to wearing it again."
2.0,"Don't do it. It looks like toy jewelry. Mine arrived missing a piece, returning it and going to David's!"
2.0,Small is not small. My sleeves look huge in comparison to the model. I‚Äôm a small person but this is more like a large. It‚Äôs huge around the neckline and under the arms.
2.0,Too big.  Sizing is off.
2.0,Was disappointed this product was not was not the same as the picture.
2.0,Not great for a 12 hr shift.  I personally needed something more in the 20 mmHg‚Äã.
2.0,It broke two days I received it!
2.0,Center stones fell out!  I bought these to wear to my son's wedding.  First and only time I had worn them.  We were taking pictures prior to the ceremony and one of the bridesmaids mentioned my center stone was missing.  We looked everywhere but could not find it.  Needless to say I was freaking out one of the girls suggested I pop the other center stone. I did and they were just a pretty she saved my day but not happy with losing a stone after 2 hours of easy wearing!!!
2.0,"The men's large was the size of a woman's small. Very disappointed, my husband could not wear it."
2.0,Do yourself a favor and buy one with a drawstring in the back bc these stretch out then won't stay up.
2.0,The fabric is bad bad bad
2.0,Disappointed that what I received was not what was pictured here. The ones I received are missing the silver details on the front I was specifically looking for. They are also more of a toddler size sunglass. Think I am going to return.
2.0,"I was sent the wrong watch. It was a completely different design, rectangular shape instead of circular and the face was a different lay out.<br />I notified amazon and they emailed me a return label right away with no hassle."
2.0,There is not one rhinestones on this mask. The picture is very misleading. It is nothing but a cotton mask with no sparkle. Do not trust any seller who uses trickery to sell their product.
2.0,Pretty happy to a point. Lens keep slipping out of frames when wearing.
2.0,"I used the size chart for the actual product and it is way off. They came in a bag marked 2x and a note that says don't worry about sizing on bag, but that it should be the size that fits me. I am 5'5 160lb and have a 31 inch waist. The pajamas actually do look like a 2X size, so back they go. They are super cute and well made though."
2.0,Way too small! Order a size up
2.0,"The body of this is very large and baggy. I am expecting, so I ordered a large so that it will still fit in a few months, but it is way bigger than I anticipated. It is also very short. The bottom of the shirt just barely reaches the top of my butt. It's too short for me to wear with leggings. I can wear it with jeans, but when I sit down then stand up again it is full of wrinkles. I like the color, and it is very soft, but the cheap material and awkward fit make it an &#34;around the house&#34; only shirt."
2.0,This is very cheaply made. I was very disappointed in the quality.
2.0,I love them when they stay intact but you do need a fabric shaver because the cloth pills up a lot. Problem is I've ordered several of these and half of them start coming apart at the seems within one wash. Not well made.
2.0,The neck and tie straps need to be longer they were too short had to add more linked to him to be able to use them
2.0,Poorly made and far to small.
2.0,Can not read the scripture at the bottom. It is unique and different.
2.0,"...can't see the thin red hand -- human eyes have difficulty seeing red, especially in shadows with black background."
2.0,"Beautiful Dress, be cautious on size, I'm a medium and it looked like a extra small. Sent back and ordered larger size."
2.0,"Not what WE expected , made vision to dark and blurry."
2.0,"Good watch, easy to set and read but band is very cheap and way too short."
2.0,The back straps are too wide.
2.0,Purchased for 16 year old grandson and they were way too small.  Picture makes them appear to be much longer.the were barely ankle socks.
2.0,"They seemed great at first, for the first part of the day. By the end of the day the material was worn away where it touched my boot. Only got one wear out of it."
2.0,It‚Äôs much smaller than it looks. I guess it‚Äôs a good value
2.0,"There are massive differences between Hawaiian shirts and Aloha shirts. The easy way to tell the difference is that Aloha shirts are nice, this one isn't. If you want to know the rather fascinating history of both these styles of shirt, look up Articles of Interest episode 4  (from 99% Invisible, a phenomenal podcast)"
2.0,Waist was ok but the legs were not in proportion and were too tight...I gave them away...
2.0,This material is cheap looking.... wasn't  happy with the quality  at all... the shipping was delayed too. The only  thing I  like was the colors.
2.0,"Feels like they just sewed some bath towels together and called it a robe.  Not what I was hoping for.  The cheap price should have tipped me off.  I'll buy something more expensive next time or find some better, less itchy towels and make my own."
2.0,Disappointing. Picture makes it look better proportioned than it looks 'live'. Too long and short. Stiff. Haven't been eager to use.
2.0,Too small<br />Returned
2.0,Can't tell back from front. Weird fit and cut. Hard to get on and uncomfortable. I feel like they might split at the crotch
2.0,I‚Äôm 5 feet even n 120 n weight n got a small it fits but a little tight on the sleeves n it shows the back bra strap n shows a lot of ur chest
2.0,It came broke
2.0,"El color me gusto , muy largo"
2.0,They fit but wasn't what I thought I was going to receive. It's supposed to be a compression type material and it is nothing more than just a regular tank top. I am not impressed and won't be purchasing anything else from this place.
2.0,"This thing is incredibly tiny, made of cheap fabric and looks awful. I had to return it. Big yikes"
2.0,"Great fit and really warm, but pom on top of hat fell off after one week of wearing"
2.0,"This was really cute but very, very small.  I am 5'10&#34; and it was way too short, so I returned it.  This dress might work best on someone that is short and slender."
2.0,"Absolutely,it is cheap pleather, and the bag is just two pieces of leather, the smell is not so good. Just one good point it is big enough"
2.0,These look a bit cheap to be honest... like low quality plastic. They‚Äôre just alright.
2.0,The draping was awful.  I returned it.
2.0,They are very pretty but extremely small. They are for little girls because they are to small for adults.
2.0,"This wasn‚Äôt flattering on me at all. Also, I found the quality just ok. Seams were stretched a bit. I thought I could overlook and just have as something quick to throw on for an errand run but I really just disliked how I looked in it. Not returning but donating."
2.0,Seems like good material just way to difficult to tighten. Can't get a good fit. I might try to change the &#34;clamp&#34;
2.0,"I was surprised at the poor quality and have started a return. Super cute, but the material is more that of a cheap Halloween costume. Also the ends are very long and pointy with unfinished edges and strings everywhere. It reminds me of a cheap vampire or witch costume. Bummed it was like that. I will say the size was accurate though."
2.0,Completely see through. Also runs large. The arm holes are so big that even a strapless bra didn‚Äôt work. Returning.
2.0,"Buttons are HUGE, the ones in the photo have to be photo are not the same. Cheap material."
2.0,I found it to be too complicated for me.
2.0,"To big, I bought larger size according to chart and it swallows me. I wear a L normally so I went XL..should have stayed with Large. Dress was pretty just didn't fit."
2.0,"The detail on the skirt is nice, but the top is terrible. The flowers are not as pictured, they are iron on tacky poinsettias and cartoon like unidentifiable flowers. Very poor quality fabric."
2.0,I don't recommend this as the quality is poor and it's very tight fitting.
2.0,you can see right through this dress.
2.0,Cute slipper but they are very slippery. They are advertised as anti slip sole but that false advertisement. Not what I expected. We have hardwood floors so slippery slippers are not good for my kids. I be returning for some slippers with a grip on the sole.
2.0,I don't normally do reviews but after two purchases gone wrong here goes. These shoes are cute but the quality could be better. They took a lot of short cuts. The ribbon isn't sown on the ends so it frays. I had to use matches to seal the ends. I used a crochet hook to thread the ribbon. The holes were punched so the thread for the crocheted heel started to unravel off the shoe. Use extreme caution with this part. The strap that goes around the ankle does not hug the ankle right. No matter how tight you pull the ribbon.... Which is flimsy so don't pull too hard. The ribbon is also short! Doesn't have the flowiness like the pictures show. I'm going to purchase something different to replace the ribbon. Don't feel the shoe was worth the money spent but I'll make it work. I don't expect them to last long as they'll probably fall apart after a few wears.
2.0,"Ordered medium and I new that the shoes would be somewhat big, but these are ridiculous. The padding in the shoes are not adequate. Poor buy on my part."
2.0,"They are cute, however two of them arrived with no keychain attached. Disappointed as I was using for birthday party goody bags."
2.0,Very disappointed in the size. I have 12 year old twin girls and ordered them a size 6.5-8 women's size.....and they have size 6 feet.....fits snuggly now which means they use once or twice. Not good. Trying to return now.
2.0,"It is made from genuine leather and looks cute, but there is poor adhesive quality and weak foot support."
2.0,Bought a size 6 and looked more like a size 4T.  Cute though...
2.0,"Polarization is a little uneven, which is normal for most brands without a big O on the side, but I figure I'd start with my lowest gripe 1st. The lenses aren't very dark at all, so much so that at the bottom it feels more like you aren't blocking any sun at all, which is really confusing on the eyes. The frame is clear, which is not smart at all because the manufacturer and country of origin is written in white on the inside, allowing it to show through backwards. That white inside paint flakes off leaving bits on the side of your face. The frames are not shatterproof at all and will break if you sit on them, it's the lenses that are shatterproof. Unisex is maybe... but they sure don't look good on men, so take that as you will. Lastly, who writes ""sunglasses"" on the side of sunglasses? It's like writing ""car"" on the side of your car. At least the chrome trim on the side is shiny I guess and they aren't uncomfortable. If you got these for next to nothing in price you'd probably chuck them in your beach bag and care little about damaging them or getting them covered in sunscreen, which is a nice thing compared to expensive brand-name shades, so +1.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click so below. Thanks :)"
2.0,"This costume is really cute the only problem is Americans are not small and petite. So it didn‚Äôt fit. Then you have to pay and box it yourself, all the money for return you get back is $2.14 . Merry Christmas"
2.0,Fuzzy slippers are excellent. I love them!
2.0,ran very large and as a result shapeless
2.0,Even with proper care and maintenance the shocking mechanism stopped working around 6 months of use.
2.0,Not very darkening.
2.0,The shorts did not fit as expected. They run small and have no give to them.
2.0,The fringes are only in the front of the dress. I would have loved it better if it was all around. Other than that. The material is stretchy it is ok for one night costume.
2.0,"It's pretty but kind of small, I'm 113lbs and it looks little on me."
2.0,Overall looks cheap. Some of the plastic stone's are glued in off center. I wonder how long it will take for it to turn my wife's wrist green.
2.0,"It fits around your chest and stomach like it should, but the shirt is entirely too short coming only slightly past my waist so that keeping it tucked in was a hassle.  Would not buy again."
2.0,"Horrible plastic sling sewn on inside and cuts into foot, fit is good but after 1 wearing sore from sewing plastic on inside ."
2.0,It broke when I put it on!
2.0,The item you get looks nothing like the picture
2.0,I loved the look of this ring very pretty! I only gave it 2 stars because not even a couple of times it was worn we noticed two of the stones had fallen out not happy about this since it was a gift for my daughter
2.0,"The dress is pretty but the bust area is way too big for even an average bust size (C or D-cup). From the waist down the dress is pretty true to size, from the waist up not at all. If it weren't for that, the dress would be a good buy. So if you have a hard time finding dresses because your bust is a bigger size than the rest of the dress this dress might be for you. Otherwise maybe keep looking."
2.0,"I wore this mask as a part of a Halloween costume where I was Tina the llama and my boyfriend was Napoleon Dynamite. This mask is definitely more realistic than the other ones out there, but it's borderline dangerous to wear it for more than a minute. The whole thing smells and feels like putting a rubber glove over your head. They expect you to be able to see and breathe out of that little mouth slit, which is literally impossible. You can't see out of the eyes, like I expected when I bought it. I tried taking scissors to the mouth and at least cutting the slit wider to be the full length of the mouth, and it was still rough to breathe in there. What I ended up doing was cutting a small hole at each side of the neck, tying a shoelace through them to wear around my neck, and then rocking the mask like a hood. So that you can see that I'm a llama, but that I feel like breathing right now.<br /><br />Sure, this thing is great for taking a good photo! But if you"
2.0,I realize these are cheap earrings at only 7.99 but the quality is even worse than that.  I could find a better quality earring at Walmart for cheaper. The stones are not set evenly and the soldering is thick and noticeable.  Love the size though.
2.0,"The top is like a cotton t-shirt, but the skirt is not soft and has the feel and sound of plastic tablecloths.  I say sound because there is a  constant sound when the dress is on.<br /><br />I couldn't stand the feel/sound and returned this item."
2.0,Picture versus description is very deceptive.  I cannot get the clasp closed because the band is so small.
2.0,Not impressed. Guess my toes need more substantial spread to feel the stretch I was hoping for... I think those foam pedicure things do a better job!
2.0,Cute but saw similar hats way cheaper at the swap meet.
2.0,It ripped at the second use.
2.0,"I really like this watch but I've only had it 6 months and it has stopped keeping time.  I replaced the battery, but unfortunately it still gets an hour or so off the correct time each day.  I would return it but apparently the return window has closed."
2.0,Makes me look like theodore
2.0,It was a little small on my husband and very thin. Cheap material.
2.0,It's a shame to write this bc the material is so nice but i ordered a L and an XL and they fit pretty much the exact same except that the XL arms/sleeves were TIGHTER than the L. Roll the dice and see if it fits you better bc like I said it's very nice material but keep low expectations for fit
2.0,The appron works good but the supplied suction cups are warped and won't hold to the mirror
2.0,I like that it is long and has slits... I don‚Äôt the cheapness of the material and the arms were very tight
2.0,It's a fairly inexpensive shirt and I expected as much. Honestly it was a soft fabric and the giraffe/ leaf is like a iron on patch which I don't mind. The problem was size. I am usually a woman's large. I purposely sized up for fear of shrinkage. I received the extra large excited but I could not even get my arms in the sleeves. Nevertheless button up around my chest. Too small!<br /><br />What is worse is that this is shipped from overseas so returning it was a no go. They did politely refund a fraction of those cost but all around disappointed. I'll be way more careful of where things ship from and their return policy.
2.0,I thought that I was ordering a shirt that said 'All Who Wander Are Not Lost'.  That was in the image.  But I received a shirt that says 'Lucky Dog' and has a dog on it.
2.0,I already have signal from my computer that the battery need to be replaced. the battery does not have long life.
2.0,2 uses and seems ripped save your $$$$
2.0,I was charged $38.40 for these pants. The tag on them says $20.97!!!! I would say that that is overcharging! I think I deserve some kind of credit on these.
2.0,Not great its shifts  alot makes it look like the 4 boobs
2.0,"Sorry, but this looks like a cowboy hat. Unless you want to wear a straw cowboy hat to the beach, do not buy."
2.0,"I was disappointed in the quality of the fabric and it was shipped with another larger item in a small plastic bag. It looks more like a nightgown than a dress. Granddaughter was happy with it she is only 4 , that's what counts or I would have asked for a refund"
2.0,These look cute but very cheaply made. I thought they would break so I returned.
2.0,"I'm a very ""medium sized"" person. 5'9"", 150lbs with an athletic build. I wear a size 38 suit jacket. I bought the large thinking it would give me extra room, but it basically fits 'perfectly' over a sweatshirt - meaning there's no extra room if I want to add layers. Further, the waist isn't elastic at all so if you're thicker around the waist than, say, 32 inches, you're gonna have a bad time. I would consider exchanging it for an extra large but the sleeves are already a bit long on me, and I'm afraid any bigger and I'd have to roll them up.<br /><br />On top of that, unfortunately it's very thin. Think of it as a windbreaker with a fleece lining added. There is no 'padding' or polyfill insulation at all (see image). Worse, the sleeves are also fleece lined (see image). While not a deal-breaker, this means you have to hold on to your sleeves while you pull the jacket on so they don't bunch up.<br /><br />Finally, it's partially my fault for not reading more carefully, but this jacket came up when I searched Amazon for ""waterproof ski jacket"" - so I assumed at least it would be waterproof. Alas, per the description, it's only 'water resistant' - and honestly that's a stretch. Indeed, when I ran it under the tap it got wet (see image). To be fair, the water beaded a little at first, but don't expect this to keep you dry for long.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because I suppose it's a decent windbreaker, it has a nice zipper, and the pockets are nice, but I'm going to have to order another jacket for my ski trip. Would not recommend unless you're slim/athletic and you're only using it for 'around the town' on chilly (but not frigid) days."
2.0,It was to small but the fabric had an odor.  Returned it to Amazon.
2.0,"Too loose, looks like a purple potato sack. Very unflattering"
2.0,"I was hoping that this product had a little bit more of a sweater feel so that it would hang a little heavier. However, it is made from a very thin cotton material that does not flow as it gets caught on hips and other curves. I am very disappointed in it but I am going to keep it because it is so pretty and I can hopefully I can use it as a bathing suit cover-up."
2.0,The stone is really pretty I like the color they‚Äôre just about twice as big as what I would like so if you like really big earrings go ahead and get them
2.0,Way to big. Not what I expected. I thought it was a locket but it's not. It's heavy. I have got lots of compliments
2.0,The puff on the sleeve keeps falling down. I feel exposed.
2.0,Too shapeless. Thin but okay. Just not flattering if youre not a curvy gal
2.0,Sizing was really off.  Fit was way too small. I did give it 2 stars because the color was cute and the dress would be cute on if it actually fit.
2.0,"Too light weight, not durable."
2.0,Many faulty pin backs makes only 3/4 of these useable. I made backpack buttons with these and I managed to lose almost all of them due to the clasps coming undone. I'd suggest investing in higher quality pin backs if you're looking for heavy wear and tear or long term pins.
2.0,Does not work.  I've had it in the window for a week and it won't work.  :(
2.0,Not high quality ‚Ä¶ feels like cardboard cheap
2.0,The necklace is very pretty. Way to big for a child and almost to big for an adult.  Bout for my nieces that range 4-10 and there‚Äôs no way it would look nice.
2.0,I didn't expect silk gloves but the stritxhing is coming out of the gloves and the fit is poor
2.0,"Sizes run extremely small. Beautiful dress, lining looks cheap but no one sees it anyway!"
2.0,I was disappointed I received two black bracelet and to top it off one of the marbles was broken!!
2.0,"This product was way too small. It was almost like a crock top. If the sizing was right, I may have liked it. Just don‚Äôt feel like dealing with returning it."
2.0,Do not buy if you have a small wrist!
2.0,"The picture is very deceiving. The camera makes the colors look very vibrant, but they aren't. The colors are very dull and I'm not too crazy about the pattern either. It looked like it could be a table cloth as well. I'm 4'11 and 130 pounds and the skirts was not quite floor length, but right about my ankles. It was a very awkward length for me. The waist is elastic so it fit fine. I just think it made me look extremely wide. I/m not a fan of the material either. I know the other patterns are very nice so I will be returning this one and possible ordering one of the others."
2.0,It's a beautiful skirt. But not true to size and anyone ordering should get a size up at least. Also the material should've been more thicker too.
2.0,unfortunately i will not be able to get to use them as they arrived all bent
2.0,Cracked the lense after 1 day. I like the look a lot but he lenses were s*** polarization is good but they really cracked after being put in my bag for 3 hours
2.0,This is a pretty sweater but the material wasn't as expected but I actually kept it to wear still! It does have nice color the pink is really pretty!!
2.0,The shoe is good looking but not much use I got from it. Used this three times. Mind you mine is a crawler still the shoe just withered.
2.0,It was very thin and not oversized at all and i even went up a Size to hope it would. Also the zipper was cheaply done and sat weird on my body
2.0,"I found the sleeves material too stiff and looking odd. The size is also off. I ordered size M and received an item with XL label cut in half. My expectations were high even after reading bad reviews, so I was very much disappointed."
2.0,"Unfortunately had to return these briefs. Waste band elastic way too minimal, thin and weak for even myself, as small well proportioned person. Medium size seemed to be mislabeled as should have been a Large? Legs too long if wearing shorts, and pull down already weak waistband. Customer service was very co-operative and seemingly interested in improving their product."
2.0,"They're very cute and small, however they are way too long. They're the length of a regular earring, if not longer. I can't wear these in my nose, which is the reason I bought them, because they poke my septum. I'll keep them and wear them in my ears, however they are not like what you buy in stores. The saying is true, you get what you pay for."
2.0,The dress felt like a burlap sack and has no shape. Its literally to cuts a fabric badly sewn together:(
2.0,"I ended up returning this dress. I thought it was going to be more like a cotton-knit, but instead it was like wearing a dress made from spanx material. Not at all how I pictured. I'm have an hourglass shape, but aside from the stretchy material, I don't think it was a flattering cut for me either. Maybe it's more flattering for someone who's larger on top but smaller on bottom? Disappointed cause I wanted to wear it for an occasion coming up."
2.0,Great quality really is made well but the installation process is a joke no watch should be this hard to put on if it had an easier attachment it would be a 5 star
2.0,It fits terribly. Worst pair of underwear ever
2.0,"Quite a STRUGGLE to get on, have not tried to swim in it yet, afraid I will be &#34;stuck&#34; and not able to get it off.<br />I would like to exchange it but no return instructions were in the package."
2.0,It was heavy and Ill-fitting. I would have been dropping with sweat if I wore that this summer. Weird material and fit weirdly. Returned.
2.0,"since it has NO nose... there is no room for your nose inside of the mask... so it fits really tight around your nose... and my nose is average size... the rest of the mask is okay.. the price is cheap.,.... ssssooo???"
2.0,Too tight and I always wear this size...
2.0,"I ordered this dress in a xxLarge.  I am 5'6&#34; 170 and I could not even get into it at all.  It is WAY small.  I was really disappointed as I thought the dress was VERY cute, but the sizing chart is EXTRemely wrong."
2.0,Size is small and make you look like A clown.
2.0,A decent product.  Bit overpriced.  Cool American colors
2.0,Smaller and not strechy! Also WHERE is THE FLEECE? Returned
2.0,"WOW could never wear this out, no eye holes"
2.0,"Overall super great price. Three stars because 42/180 wouldn't work. Came in small black bags, not individually wrapped/protected."
2.0,Length is way too short to wear as a dress.
2.0,Not 18k. I had them for less then a year. Wore them 7 or 8 times and they turned copper!!!!
2.0,"Awkward fitting top, made of nylon.  Too bad cause the print is so cute and fun. Hem is tight. Doesn't even look good belted. May cut it up and make it into something else."
2.0,I'm wanting to know where is the lifetime guarantee how do I go about getting a receipt for this item if I have to send it back due to it tarnishing or turning colors I got nothing but the anklet and a box no guarantee
2.0,"Not the color red as represented. More maroon. Would try the grey/black stripe but since this one was overly long I'm going to pass. It made me look blockshaped (I', 5'6&#34;, 130 lbs. Seemed wide from middle on although shoulders fit fine."
2.0,Much shorter than the pictures show. Good quality just runs very small and tight
2.0,I really do not like to clothes because of the size. Every country has their own size chart
2.0,"I have purchased several jack smith golf skirts and loved them all! I recieve compliments all the time so When i seen the flash sale I thought why not 1 more skirt!  had I known that flash sale ment the product was a ""second"" - interlining pocket sewed upside down, shorts below skirt . if flash means second advertise as such."
2.0,"These were enormous on me, I‚Äôd say the XS was more like a medium/large. I returned themüòû The fabric and quality was nice thoughü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2.0,"It is nothing like the picture!!! I purchased the skeleton top. The material is not nice, the print quality is poor, and the print itself seems low on the shirt. There is a very simple white rib cage placed too low with no shading or definition on a low quality and thin black shirt. Under the armpit area, it sticks out weirdly and the cut is not as nice as the picture. It is tight on the breast even though I have a small bust and then it hangs weirdly from there. It is too tight in some places and too loose in others. I do not recommend this purchase because it is not worth the money. I gave 2 stars because the print is still kinds cute if you wear it with a hoodie or sweater. Overall, I do not recommend this purchase. - Isabella Pascali"
2.0,Way too large for me even though I got a size I thought would fit me.
2.0,Love the pendant but chain is not great quality
2.0,While the wallet did fit my passport (tightly) &#34;RFID blocking&#34; is not accurate. I can easily use my RFID cards without having to take them out of the wallet.
2.0,The material is different from the picture.  It is a base cotton dress not a formal dress
2.0,"My boyfriend gave me a set of similar AND1 low cut socks in black. They are the performance type in size 6 - 12.5 and not the ultra soft type listed here. Nevertheless, I suspect they are similar in every other way but the softness and the color. Originally, he purchased them for himself because he is a size 12 foot. However, after wearing them and washing them, they shrunk tremendously as you can see from the photo. Since he considered them tight before washing and way too tight after washing, I inherited them.<br /><br />I tried these and they are soft but thin. Since I am a size 9, they fit me well after the shrinkage. Nevertheless, I personally do not like a product that is not true to size (as my boyfriend discovered) and I am totally disappointed in a brand that shrinks. Lucky these will fit a size 9 after shrinkage, otherwise, I would have to throw them out after the first wear."
2.0,"Bonita prenda, no estira soy talla M general mente. Ped√≠ Xl me tallo apret√≥, con una talla m√°s hubiese quedado perfecto"
2.0,After only one wash this sweatshirt pilled up heavily.  I bought it for outdoor construction so I don't really care (I just needed the safety orange color) but if your expecting a good quality shirt for 14$ this isn't it!!
2.0,these do not look like the picture!! there are two holes instead of one and these seem to be bigger.
2.0,Product is cut way small for the size I ordered.  I guess they would be ok if they fit!
2.0,"According to the price,  quality is just fine.  Them fit well  in the cuffs of most shirts. Instead, size smaller than &#34;average&#34;  men's cufflinks."
2.0,"For reference - I'm 5'3, 120 lbs. I ordered medium black - it's way too tight in the arms. I'll be returning. I also received a dress with uneven stripes at the waist and I believe I'd read some others complaining about that. The thing that surprised me the most was HOW HEAVY the dress is. I am not kidding - this thing weighs a ton and you're liable to burn up in it. If you want to go for it most definitely order one to two sizes up."
2.0,"Cute band, but it is not compatible with Series 4 40mm watch. Metal adapters are too large to slide into the slots on the device."
2.0,It‚Äôs a really cute outfit!<br />The sizing is extremely off though :/<br />I got a size 6 for my 3 year old and I can‚Äôt even get the shirt on him. It fits my 1 year old daughter that‚Äôs in 24 month clothes
2.0,After purchasing this product after 8 months came apart. I believe this cheaply made and not worth the price. Don't waste your money. The actually finish started to go away after only 1 month.
2.0,Not for women with a button
2.0,"Loved the purse, it looks nice!  However, the compartment was not large enough for my pistol which is small, so not sure why!  Too bad, kept the purse as it is cute, but can't use if needing to carry!"
2.0,Not as nice quality as Capezio.
2.0,They gave me blisters
2.0,"Thin like paper, and stiff.... threads coming loose already.  Would not recommend.  It was cheap."
2.0,"Cheap material, snug fitting"
2.0,"The material on this is great but the cut of it is‚Ä¶ weird never have this issue either‚Ä¶ typically if something fits my bust it fits everywhere but it‚Äôs like this shirt narrows to the hip so the stomach area is SMALLER than the bust. Usually the bust is the biggest so that‚Äôs weird. As you can see from the unflattering picture, it doesn‚Äôt look good on my size 24 body. Saving it for when I get to maybe a size 20 as I e been losing weight, but definitely too small for my body type (apple)."
2.0,"Super cute, but 2 of them broke within the first evening wearing them. Costume jewelry, and behaves as such."
2.0,"I should‚Äôve expected that when it comes to getting what you pay for, this certainly fits that description. Nice to wear around the house and out for a short while, but no way would I spend an entire day in these boots. Inside sole feels like cardboard with a cheap cotton cover over it (which is already coming apart after only ONE day wearing them around the house). The only good thing about them is they are warm- like slippers."
2.0,They are cute but cheap.  Read the dimensions.  Too small for my use.
2.0,This scarf looked pretty in the picture but NOT to wear :-( . I think it can not be returned due to low cost- Or I would return if I could. CHECKBEFORE YOU BUY! This is my first poor review of a product.
2.0,Its a cheap piece of jewelry. Turns my skin black therefore it‚Äôs NOT sterling silver but cheap dipped!
2.0,"Both the shirt and pants are see-through. Also, there was no pocket as pictured. I ordered these in XS for my 11 yo daughter hoping they‚Äôd be loose. The fit wasn‚Äôt terrible, just a bit snug around the waist. She‚Äôs in that preteen stage and was very uncomfortable about how see through it all was so she just sleeps in them as opposed to being able to lounge around the house in them at nights."
2.0,Not as pretty as the picture.  T-shirt material that just didn't look fancy and did nothing for me.  I returned it.
2.0,"This shirt seems tailored for short, fat men. The length is too small relative to the size yet it is far too wide. If you have an average or athletic build and are looking for something form-fitting, pass on this one."
2.0,Was just to big
2.0,Be careful in ordering this.  If you don't like it you need to ship it back to China for a return.
2.0,"This top is extremely short (Crop top length!) and gets shorter if you have to pull it up to cover your bra like I had to. The pattern is pretty, though.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù, approx 250lbs."
2.0,Flimsy and fell apart quickly.
2.0,I placed my order three months later the wrong print shows up. They sent me the one I ordered on them for the mix up. (That was nice) but the shirt I ordered looks nothing like the print. It looks cheap. The print is ‚Äúodd‚Äù looking have t put my finger on it to describe it. But not like the picture!!!
2.0,"The material in the picture is not what you get. The material in the pictures looks like stretchy, sportswear. That‚Äôs not what you get. What you get isn‚Äôt bad it‚Äôs just not what‚Äôs advertised."
2.0,"expected a little bit better quality that this.  its soft yes but this material.  also much to big on the ears,  who would honestly have that big of ears anyway?"
2.0,They loosen up easily and fall out
2.0,Made very stiffly. Not very flexible. Pretty and nice for the price.
2.0,Fitting was crustal
2.0,"The print/screen on the shirt is poor quality. Just by putting it on, the logo parted. I'm sure it will look worse once washed"
2.0,Seam for the waist seemed to low and was annoying
2.0,Very cheap tears easy.
2.0,"Cheaply made, but that's not the part I'm concern about. As you see in the picture, the upper right of the heart is kinda missing/broke off. I couldn't even find the missing part in the package and the box which mean it was made like this in the factory. I have to try and fix it on my own because I don't have the time for returning this(needed for a party). For a name like Disney product, I am very dissapointed."
2.0,"Loved it until the cheap little plastic ring they use to attach the strap to the back of the dress just let go... turned out there's a break in that little ring, I guess so they can get it on there, but it also makes it too easy to just fall off, and it does constantly, and exposes you suddenly.<br /><br />I wanted to return it but just got &quot;there is no product support for this product.&quot; I guess I can just sew it on, but I would rather have just returned it than having to dig out my dusty old sewing kit to make it something usable."
2.0,"I was expecting this to fit exactly the way it is shown in the picture.  Unfortunately, my feather point down, and my netting doesn't cover my eyes as seen in the picture."
2.0,"These sunglasses are very stylish but unfortunately as far as quality, you really get what you pay for. I wore these for a day at a music festival. By sundown, they literally broke while on my face!<br />Cute, but don't expect them to last long."
2.0,"very flimsy ring, not very good quality"
2.0,It doesn't suit me.
2.0,The color of the grey purse is totally different than what the picture shows. I would not have chosen this color of even this purse if I had known
2.0,"this one-piece bathing suit is huge. I usually wear size Small since I am only 105 lbs but this way too loose, material was also so-so. Had to return.."
2.0,"Was a little disappointed with the actual size of the pendant, but was living with it. But as of yesterday the little link snapped off. Had it less than a month. For the price its not really worth returning it. You get what you pay for"
2.0,"I got this for my granddaughter. The neckline is different (higher and no v neck)  and the colors are not as show in the picture. Its lightweight T-shirt material, main color purple with light purple hood and lower sleeves. There is no stitching in the lower sleeves as shown also. That would make the sleeves pucker properly. She loves it although and I will take it. I got her a small and it fits well. She is 109 lbs. Took a long time to arrive."
2.0,"Glad it was on sale,  would have been very mad to pay the full price,  looked cheap and weird silver bronze color,  not like the picture."
2.0,This shirt (Large) is a beautiful color and fit. I‚Äôm so sad that the stitching is coming apart and doesn‚Äôt lay flat. Sad to have to return it.
2.0,The arm holes were very droopy and loose. Returned it.
2.0,"This is such a cute garment but that line of lace that‚Äôs supposed to go under the bust is actually weirdly high, and sits above the bust! It‚Äôs very odd. I wear a size 20, and the fit is fine, it‚Äôs not tight or otherwise too small, it‚Äôs just the cut and placement of that lace. Possibly would work on a very small chested person, but how many plus-size customers are that?"
2.0,I didn‚Äôt get what I ordered. I ordered a hoodie and what came was a sweatshirt.
2.0,Padding in the rear is good but not so much towards the front.  Does not go very far - too short and not a lot of padding. Needs to be longer in the front and more padding like the back panels
2.0,"I own a jacket very similar. I‚Äôve gained weight recently and the small I have is tight now. I‚Äôm running in between a small and medium but I usually go with mediums. So even though I knew this was a different brand than my old one, I figured the medium was a safe bet. It fit significantly smaller than the one I currently have. I couldn‚Äôt even get it on my shoulders. I wasn‚Äôt even sure if a large would fit so I didn‚Äôt chance exchanging it, I just returned it. Jacket looks like it would have been made well but was just so tiny."
2.0,Unfortunately the sleeves were too short on this. Had to return it.
2.0,"Was wrong size, just gave away as gift, they love it!!"
2.0,"much thinner material than expected, not good for cooler weather as long sleeve polos should be. fits on the small side."
2.0,Nice pins but some items wer missing & some dbl same item. Sellers refunded no problem. Good service.
2.0,These are too dim to see our pups in the dark.
2.0,"Beautiful Dress""""""It was too small and narrow in the chest. I order a 4x couldn't even get my arms in it at all."
2.0,There was no pockets and got soiled too easily.
2.0,"When this mask arrived, I was super impressed at first.  The mask is made from a thick foam material. I had really expected it to be more of a hard plastic.  The mask was used for a production of Beauty and the Beast for the wolf scenes.  There were about 10-12 children in the play who ordered this exact same mask.  The mask had an elastic strap across the back.  The mask fit the children and teens well across the face and they all said it was comfortable.<br /><br />Here is why I am only giving it two stars.  While the mask seemed like good quality, the first night of practice they were used a couple of masks &#34;broke&#34;.  One broke the first time it was tried on.  Where the strap attaches to the mask, the foam material just ripped.  I think the problem is that the elastic strap was too short.  There was no really easy way to repair this since the side of the mask ripped.  Now  had this just been on child or teen I would assume that they were to blame but in the end over 1/2 of the masks did the exact same thing.  It didn't seem to matter the size of the person wearing them.  We had 8 year olds up to 16 year olds whose masks ripped like this.  We had to really problem solve to figure out how to fix this and keep them together for the play.  Maybe if you are just looking to wear this for one evening, it might be okay but for what we did, the masks just didn't last.  I think that an adjustable strap of some kind might work better and that way it is not pulling on the mask so much.<br /><br />So while the masks looks good, I could not give it a higher rating  because once the masks tears, it's really nonfunctional without a lot of work to fix it."
2.0,I got a small from looking at reviews ( I'm a 34b) my boobs wanna hang out the sides<br />It's totally see through!! Very cheap made!
2.0,"I am 5‚Äô6, 140#, typically wear a size 8, 34D and got a large. It‚Äôs not really too big, but it is not flattering. Adding a belt might help with that. The dress is long, it almost touches the ground. The slits come almost to my knee. The cutouts at the neck are raw and asymmetrical. Unfortunately they fall along your bra line so your straps on one side are completely visible. The side pockets (while I DO love pockets) hang strangely and make your hips look larger. The material is soft and doesn‚Äôt show wrinkles. Quality is as expected. I would recommend sizing down. It would probably work best for thin, less curvy women too."
2.0,"It‚Äôs okay looking, nothing special. It may have been passable had it not been humongous on my wrists. I do have very small wrists so this is a struggle with a lot of bracelets. If you‚Äôre average or more, give it a whirl, but if you‚Äôre like me it‚Äôs a pass."
2.0,The fit was a lot smaller than stated.
2.0,The dress was too large. There was too much fabric. The gems were also coming off of the dress. The back of the dress looked very awkward.
2.0,"This is thicker, stiffer, slightly-stretchy fabric. Not jersey /cotton, but more like a lycra/polyester blend. The stitching and cut, the waistband and the zipper all seem to be good quality, but it doesn't fit well.  Size runs small. I ordered 1 size up from what I normally wear and it's too small. I can still wear it - - but high up on my waist. It's ill-fitting fine and it's annoying to have to wear it so high. The length of the back and front is above knee, and the asymmetric part goes below knee. I initially thought I'd wear it, but I've only worn it once since purchase quite a while ago because I keep choosing to wear the higher quality, better fitting clothing in my closet. This will go to goodwill if I don't find reason to wear it soon."
2.0,The product appears of poor quality. I have not even tried on the red jersey and it has a hole or tear in it. Disappointed.
2.0,"Not at all what I was expecting. They come in a case which was nice, however, they are extremely large for the average size mouth."
2.0,"When I first got these I loved them, wear them everyday with everything but quickly the coating began to peel off and now they can not be worn. It seems as though the coating/color was laid on and now it isn't there making them hard to see out of and no sun protection for my eyes. Very sad I have had to trash these already."
2.0,Weird feeling material
2.0,returned too cheap for price
2.0,it not clip well.  I wore it to work and it fell off and I lost it.
2.0,Just soo much
2.0,"The bust was really large for a size 8.  And, the bottom area isn't wide enough.  This item was returned for these reasons"
2.0,Meh. The fabric isn't great. Wasn't what I was hoping for.
2.0,"I ordered gray but the dress is more greenish than gray. The pictures shows more rubbles, but when I iron mine doesn‚Äôt have that much. It fit perfectly that‚Äôs the only reasons I gave 2 stars."
2.0,"I bought a size Medium and it fit good, however the hood is WAY to small to be used and the material is awful, I don't like the feel of it .. It seems like after a few times wearing it, it will stretch out to a large. I'm not keeping it that long to find out .. Returned right away."
2.0,"First of all, the light brown strap is not like shown on pictures, it is somewhat yellowish/orange colored, the straps are easy to put and remove, the come with extra pins, they are a little bit stiff even after some use."
2.0,"Wow, the quality of these is really lacking. I was hoping to be able to wear these out in public, like to the gym, but there is no way to go out in these. With or without underwear, it's not a good idea. They look cute otherwise, but are just way too see-through."
2.0,"Fits small, looks cheap"
2.0,"The only reason I was willing to pay over $70 for a made in China item is because it clearly states DOWN in the title. When you get it in real life, you will see  It is 100% polyester. What is with the top 1000 amazon reviewers not even touching on this?<br /><br />*not warm. I tend to run hot (I'm usually hot), wore this outside in the high 40s, low 50s and was cold. I had a fleece, leggings underneath and was wearing boots.<br /><br />*not down. I'm really sick of ads blatantly lying. I just bought a hat on amazon advertised as 100% wool and I open it up and tag shows it is mostly poly. This ad says down, and tag  in person says 100% poly.<br /><br />*overprices for being 100% poly.<br /><br />*hood is cosmetic only. It is dramatic and beautiful bc it's so large but the slightest wind knocked this right down the very first time I wore it for a test run.  It wasn't even an extreme wind. Imagine how this would perform on a windy day? There is nothing to secure the hood (no snaps, no strings) so it doesn't stay up - and it also completely obscures your peripheral vision.<br /><br />*no waist definition. Look at the widest part of your body. for me it's the hips. Since this has no waist definition, it will create a box shape on your body, as wide as the widest part of your body. It looks like a giant shapeless sack.<br /><br />*not puffy - not much filling, and flat - so it's not warm.<br /><br />*great length. The other vest I tried on seemed to be much thicker and more shapely and flattering, but short. This has a great length and keeps your arms free and covers your bum if you're wearing leggings, even if you're tall.<br /><br />But since the sellers have no qualms about lying to your face about the material and grossly overcharging for polyester, and since it's not warm nd has no functional hood and is shapeless and not flattering, I am returning. I do love the length and wish there were more options out there. I might have kept this for warmer winter days and cinch a belt on it if it were cheaper and didn't lie in the ad."
2.0,"Pros: it is pretty.  Cons: some of the beads look/feel like plastic not crystal. also it is not 108 beads, but only 100, so is not a true buddhist prayer mala."
2.0,Chain broke a few days after my purchase .
2.0,I was very disappointed with this dress. Its cute but runs much smaller than the other dresses of the same brand. The arm holes are super tight.  I would go up two sizes possibly more for this dress.
2.0,It was so much smaller than the picture.  Not worth the price.  It is sized for a child not an adult.
2.0,no side inside pockets or tie as described in the description...too bad cuz it was cute - nice pattern & feel to the fabric.
2.0,Order 1-2 size up if you want the over sized look in the picture.
2.0,I like it but just was too big for my face
2.0,"This swimsuit looks nice and fit in the waist as expected but the top was too tight and it was too short overall. I'm 5'1"" so I do not have a long torso by any means but the suit pulls down and down not cover, support or really even look good on my chest."
2.0,It is advertised as tie dye but it‚Äôs just a print. It‚Äôs cheap looking but fit is good.
2.0,"I was very excited about getting this skirt, but unfortunately it runs a little too large in my opinion. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and around 145 nowadays so it gets me size medium in most clothing, so I ordered medium. Skirt is way too large and also very long. I can do some alterations if I need to, but her I‚Äôd have to resew the whole thing. I‚Äôm sending it back. If I‚Äôll decide order small I‚Äôll come rewrite my review."
2.0,"Was not as high quality as I'd hoped. Very ""flat"" hat, so it felt like the text was more on the top of my head than towards the front. Cheap materials too. Would not pay more than $10 for this hat, knowing what I know now.<br />Update: I no longer wear the hat. I just put it facing out of the rear window of my car so when I pull up to a stoplight, someone can give me some DD on some good stock picks. Still waiting :/"
2.0,"Only giving it 2 stars because who has EVER heard of mens socks needing to be hand washed?  I'll keep them and see how they hold up, but there is NO WAY i'm taking time to freaking hand wash my socks, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard of.  I really think you need to go back to the drawing board and figure out some material that can withstand machine washing.  If I would have seen that before ordering I wouldn't have gotten them.<br /><br />Other than that, I love the look and fit!"
2.0,Beautiful choker but it was too short and too flimsy.. would not recommend
2.0,"Even though these are very inexpensive, they‚Äôre worthless because the little post coming out of the top of the gummy bear pulled right out of both before I even wore them once."
2.0,Pretty in picture...but no zipper or buttons... very hard to get in and out of
2.0,3 sizes smaller than USA size. Plan accordingly. Shipping was fast
2.0,Great bracket with beautiful colors and craftsmanship.  I only rated this low because the bracelet was small and I order the larger size.  After a few days of wearing the bracelet my wrist hurt and was red
2.0,"First off I noticed when removing it from the package- The red is not shiny glossy, neither bright. The sheen is non existent. The red color is a dull dark muddy red, and to top it off, only the outside is printed; and the inside is WHITE. That's a big NO for me"
2.0,Cheaply made .. should be a nightgown!! Waste of money.. don‚Äôt buy!
2.0,Not made for women with hips
2.0,Does not look like picture it's half the size and very small the slit is awkward too
2.0,I am not too happy with this ring because about 3 days after getting it the ring started to turn color it was silver looking and now it has a cooper color. Its very pretty ring as long as I left it in box. I discovered it is not for everyday use
2.0,Attractive but infortunately it apart within weeks.
2.0,This reads that goes until 6years. My son is 2 and he is not a big robust boy and omg this is way too small for him. The shade does not even goes to the back and obviously the hat per se doesn‚Äôt fit his head. Really disappointed
2.0,Tutu can NOT be worn alone. Will need to find some matching pastel capri leggings or something
2.0,This is cheap looking. Haven't worn it since I bought it several months ago.
2.0,"Runs small,normally wear a Med ordered a Large. Still tight."
2.0,Only wore a couple of times and all the seams are coming apart. Save the money and spend it on a better quality night shirt.
2.0,Price is really cheap and a consequence quality is cheap too.
2.0,"this shirt is yellow, not beige. also, it is very wide and not very long. barely covers my chest"
2.0,"The Pokemon Trainer in your home will love these, but I wish they had a firmer back that ensured the pin will stay attached to wherever you put it (lost one or two that were on the outside of a backpack on the first day of use)."
2.0,Too small. Kinda thin.
2.0,It is not as expected. I ordered a large and it was huge. The material is too heavy.
2.0,Cheap looking and just didn‚Äôt fit right
2.0,I can not really say much about the quality as I ordered this based on it saying it was a larger size.  This runs the same as the large band from Apple.  It is not larger like noted.
2.0,I'm a guy who wears one earring. Seemed like a good idea but much too bulky.
2.0,Love the skirt but literally I could wear it as a dress (strapless) and it would still drag. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and I‚Äôm curvy so I ordered a large...joke was on me
2.0,not really a good buy at all
2.0,"The material felt nice, and it appeared to be well made, but I couldn't get it on! I didn't realize when I ordered it that it has to go over your head like a sports bra. That's my fault for not realizing that it didn't have clasps. I have a small ribcage (band size 32), but this bra band was so restrictive (not stretchy like a sports bra) that I couldn't get it down over my shoulders to even try it on. Moving up a band size (or 2) would defeat the purpose, so this was a return."
2.0,"Very cheap , returned it."
2.0,The fabric is not stretchy at all. Totally uncomfortable. Cheaply made seams are not straight.
2.0,"I've ordered three pairs of these hoping that the next pair wouldn't break.  They have all broken.  They look great, not cheap, but they are badly made.  Too bad as I love the style.  Don't buy."
2.0,"Cute in theory, but at 5'4&#34; 37-28-38 in an XL I looked like a chicken ballotine.<br /><br />The top almost fit okay but those bottoms are something else."
2.0,"The quality of the shirt is poor, the color is different. We still use it though."
2.0,"I am 5'8"", 140 pounds and athletic build.  I purchased size M.  The colors of the shirts were pretty and the fabric was  ok for texture, however the fit on me was awful.  The sleeves were 2"" above my wrists and the waist was too tight and short in length.  The shoulder and chest area fit me well, so a larger size would have been baggy.  Returning these to Amazon."
2.0,The the extra piece that should prevent fogging comes from under the nose wire. This makes the mask uncomfortable. I‚Äôve had to rip it off. The material is flimsy.
2.0,"It isn't ""rose"" pink it's a hot pink. Sleeves are silky material, which I didn't expect. Sizing runs big, I'm normally a medium and it was quite baggy. I'll probably keep it for a pajama shirt."
2.0,looks great....holds up terribly. Would not buy again
2.0,"Poor quality, no supportive structure to the shoulder/sleeve area.  It was also a odd shade of orange."
2.0,So cute but...... The bottom was perfect in size the top shrank a ton so small
2.0,Mine is very loose and makes a crinkling sound when squeezed as if it is mayne stuffed with a plastic shopping bag and nothing else. I really don't know because I haven't cut it open but I'm not very pleased with its lack of firmness.
2.0,"The earings are absolutely beautiful, unfortunately after one wear the gold part started to turn black."
2.0,The previous Stetson I bought was this size & it fit perfectly.  This one is too small
2.0,"I was very excited to order the 18K Gold-Plated Round Disc Engraved Initial Pendant by Wild Flower for my daughter. After reading the reviews, as well as the information provided by the supplier, I felt it would be a great birthday gift. When the product arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how cutely is was packaged (in a stamped cloth bag). Upon opening the bag and seeing the necklace, however, I was disappointed in the product. I expected to see a shiny gold plated necklace as many of the pictures in the customer reviews had shown. What I received instead was an orange-ish, cheap looking, fake looking gold necklace. I have included a picture (below) which actually makes the necklace look better than what it looks like in person. I would not recommend the 18K Gold-Plated Round Disc Engraved Initial Pendant for anyone looking for a shiny gold necklace (as I was looking for).<br /><br />I received my 18K Gold-Plated Round Disc Engraved Initial Pendant  at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

2.0,"Cute style, but poor construction.  The seam by the hips were rippled and didn't sit properly. The buttons were loose and kind of just hung there.  I wish it was made properly since the style is really cute."
2.0,"Light and flimsy. Odd fit. Fair price, but generally disappointed with them."
2.0,"Looked amazing on my dog! However, it did change his fur from white to black."
2.0,"The material is very cheap and see through, don‚Äôt recommend"
2.0,A little bit too big for me And I got a medium
2.0,When I opened then there was already a hole in one pocket and a rivet button on the side was off. Wore them for the first time and the knee completely ripped open down a bad seam. The ONLY reason I am keeping them is because the design is really cute and hard to find. But for the price I shouldn't have to put then back together this much.
2.0,If you like the cheap polyester material then you will love this hoodie. I had to return it because my daughter (and I) did not like the way it felt.
2.0,"Beautiful, but they did not adjust very well to stay in place."
2.0,I was so exited about this dress. It‚Äôs more of a mustard yellow. The. The nice bright yellow as pictured. Runs big. And is more of a tee shirt knit fabric. Just not at all what I was expecting!! Returning.
2.0,The fit was cute but the material is not breathable.
2.0,"They feel decent, although only 80% cotton. Buttttt..... The triceratops image is on the heel! Two useless sets of socks."
2.0,"I really loved the look and feel of this watch,  so original and ligh in weight. Got a lot of compliments.  But.....it broke (as in the connecting link pin just fell out) within days of the return window ending- about 35 days after purchase.  Go figure. Cheap. I'm bummed because even the extra link that I took out to size it is not the same size.  Cool watch but obviously won't last."
2.0,Way too thin of material. Very see through.
2.0,"Got this for my son for school. I knew this stuff ran small, so I ordered up a size. He's normally a 5 in boys, I got a 6. The pants fit him perfect. The shirts are the same size as 5t though, so he probably won't be wearing them long. Some of the stitching in the gray shirt is coming undone and he hasn't even worn it yet. It's cute, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2.0,My sister loves the purse but none of the zippers stayed zipped waist of my money
2.0,Not even close to white
2.0,"The shirt looks about like it‚Äôs shown but it is barely pre-teen sizing. I am relatively pear shaped and though I wear 10 on bottoms, I wear shirts from womens‚Äô small to boys‚Äô XL. This is the smallest shirt I‚Äôve ever seen. If I could get it over my head it would barely cover my boobs and they are NOT big enough for that to be a problem. Definitely not for adults."
2.0,It is only large because I am short so it is longer than what I was wanting but going to send it to taylor and have it shortened. Otherwise the dress doesn't zip down the back it goes up the front and it is clearly cute to zip up front and not the back but fits good and thick great for winter date night or outing.
2.0,They are super cute but too small sending back they didn't have the next size available
2.0,funny fit but great style
2.0,Huge!!! Fits my 7 year old
2.0,"The chains look good, but some of the lobster clasps are very difficult to open, and a couple of them would not open at all so I replaced the clasps. I also had to wash the chains before using, as they had an odor- smelled like a mechanics shop... grease? Still a good value for the price, but not high quality by any stretch of the imagination."
2.0,"Runs very small. I bought a medium for a 10 year old, it is small and a large for a 13 year old same problem both to small."
2.0,The purse is beautiful and roomy.  However!  The strap broke after 1 week of use.  Not well made & I'm very disappointed.
2.0,So I love the style and color and length but the material is so sheer!!! I can't weat this without another dress under it. Not even a slip would be enough. I am going to have to return it.
2.0,"I like the fabric and color however, is too loose. I usually buy SA headbands gave these a try because they were cheaper. Disappointed I can't use them."
2.0,There was a fabric snag in the middle of the design. üòî
2.0,"I got these for my 6 year old daughter as a gift because they are clip ons.  The gem part of the earring fell off every pair.  She only got to enjoy them for a couple weeks, and she takes good care of her things."
2.0,Strange fit..... returned
2.0,"This item is very big, and even if it was the right size I still don't think I would like it. The material was beautiful and the color was great, however the design is a miss. The outfit looks like gauchos from the 90's. So, if you are looking for a 90's costume this is it, but otherwise I would skip."
2.0,"The bottoms are cute. That is about all I can say. I listened to what others said about buying a size up to help the zipper stay put, but it did not work. The zipper is really cheap and poorly made. For reference, I am a 36B and I bought a large, based on the advice. I literally busted out of the zipper. Amusing, but not wearable."
2.0,"I bought this suit in a XXL. I'm 6'2&#34;  230lbs.  It was tough to get into.  When I was able to get the suit on, with help from my wife, it worked great.  The second time I went to use the suit the zipper on the hood was missing some teeth and would not zip up.  I returned the suit.  I had also purchased an XXXL after using this suit the first time and having a challenge getting it on.  However the XXXL seems smaller.  The legs are long but the body seems shorter.  I could not even get it on.  I have kept the second suit for my wife to wear but will be looking for a better quality and better fitting suit for myself."
2.0,"Love the dress, however, the way the pockets are design makes for an aweful and unflattering fit...need to go back to the drawing board...obviously no one has tried these dresses on.  Also I shouldnt have to spend extra $$ to alter the pockets..."
2.0,"I bought this with low expectations to begin with, but when I received the package, there was already a stain on the white kimono. I immediately sent it back to get a full refund. I didn't order another one because I would get the replacement too late, to wear this for an anime convention. I was hoping with other reviews saying this ran big that it would fit well, but that wasn't the case. I think you do have to be smaller chested for it to fit well."
2.0,Not happy with how it fits. Very weird fitting in the top .
2.0,Got sent the wrong size. Super long also. Material is gross.
2.0,Kind of thin though.
2.0,I didn't like these they don't work with stilettos at all
2.0,I am not loving the material
2.0,Feel like wore plastic on me
2.0,"While the top and connectors have a full greenish color, the actual melon itself is a faded blue."
2.0,took forever to arrive and was waaaay to big
2.0,This really didn‚Äôt fit right. It was very short and wide. Itchy material.<br />Might work for someone with a shorter torso
2.0,Appears different than what's pictured. I'll give it away as a gift.
2.0,The part that your toes fit around was rough and wasn't comfortable
2.0,This hat fits me strange. The sides pop out. The bill is shaped in a V and doesn‚Äôt shape well. I like the material it‚Äôs made out of.
2.0,I wouldn't waste my money on these again. Just didn't care for the looks
2.0,This hat is okay it's best for summer weather not everyday use looks and feels like it's made out of thin material
2.0,The 2 first top rows of shoes lace broke on the first day of use as I was squatting. I changed them and it happen again. I won't buy them again.
2.0,"These are okay. The bottom middle part of the lace in front looks a little inside out. One came with a hole in the seam. It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm planning on wearing them under shirts anyway.<br /><br />They seem to run pretty small and dont fit well on my larger hips but that‚Äôs probably my fault for not getting the medium.<br /><br />They‚Äôre okay. What I expected, really."
2.0,It‚Äôs ok just not the quality I thought it would.
2.0,Broke shortly after purchase
2.0,Fabric too heavy and waist band and rope too heavy for me. I wanted to wear on beach. These are too heavy for that.  I live in a warm climate. I like light fabrics
2.0,While the sleeves are nice the quality is not.
2.0,Poor quality. Lots of loose threads dangling. No place for filter insert.
2.0,"No soon after I bought this did the lining on the inside rip. It looks better on, than it does keeping you warm. I do get a lot of compliments though."
2.0,Purchased in brown and black size 10.  Brown fit well but black pair is very snug.  It's summer so too soon to know how socks will impact.
2.0,"Returning this. They are a great price but the material is very cheap and see through. It has a shininess to it that immediately screams cheaply made. They are also very thin and completely see through.  I ordered a small (5‚Äô3 118 lbs) and it was not very fitted. It‚Äôs not a flattering baggy for though either , and the sleeves are not tight at all especially from the elbow down which I hate. Product is a great price but, I‚Äôd rather spend a little more for better quality and fit. These might be good for someone who is looking to layer this underneath something but keep in mind even the sleeves are not fitted."
2.0,"I was looking for another couples bracelet because our other one broke by the string that holds the beads. We‚Äôve had them for 1.3 years, so I decided to order a different brand and different kind. The one I had before was the same thing as this, but instead of the crown, it was replaced with the other bracelet bead color (1 different bead in the middle). Anyways I ordered the LOLIAS one on the 5th, it was supposed to come on the 9th. But it got delayed till the 10th. I got it and it came in okay packaging but poor protection. The woman‚Äôs bracelet ‚Äúlooks‚Äù good and ‚Äúlooks Durable‚Äù but the men‚Äôs bracelet isn‚Äôt even dark black, it‚Äôs like a light black that looks very discolored. Almost like dried up substance that has been sitting out for months. It‚Äôs durability isn‚Äôt the best, but I hope it last because the ‚Äúgems‚Äù on crowns don‚Äôt look too promising , I just got it and it‚Äôs already missing one from the packaging."
2.0,"I dont think I can return. One size too small, cheaply made and no professional Mark's"
2.0,"This is a cute dress but it is much longer than it looks in photos. I'm 5'7"" and it's practically a floor length. Photos make it look like it hits mid calf."
2.0,Way too small! Tried both a small and medium.
2.0,Short we‚Äôre not white they are silver
2.0,The dress is beautiful - but it runs small and short.
2.0,"It's a pretty shirt, just more like a small large.sad"
2.0,I got the item but there is a missing part the metal buckle
2.0,"I've been using this belt daily for about a month and I cannot find a single fault with it. The ratchet mechanism works flawlessly and it's great to be able to loosen and tighten it with almost no effort. This is easily the best belt that I've ever owned regardless of the price.<br /><br />UPDATE: After using this belt for awhile I can no longer recommend it. The buckle constantly loosens by itself while I'm walking, sitting, or standing still. It's a nice idea that just doesn't seem to be engineered very well. I reduced my rating to 2 stars."
2.0,I have purchased another pair of joggers from this company so I had a certain expectation on the quality and this pair did not cut it. The material is very cheap. It feels like an in between of swishy sweats and reagual sweats. They are extremely slim fit with no stretch and very uncomfortable.
2.0,I bought this for my 10 year old. It's too tight. When it stretches you can't really see the graphics.
2.0,"I get that they need to be tight on top to stay up, but they don‚Äôt need to be too tight that they cause a ‚Äúmuffin top‚Äù kind of scenario with your thighs."
2.0,I always have worn a 7 M in Clark's loafers. These are super tight and smaller than expected but clearly say 7 M inside. I'll have to return them. Pretty disappointed as they are really cute shoes.
2.0,Not what I expected.  Looks cheap.
2.0,"Eh, they are alright but honestly not very comfortable. They still sit on the ear like a regular mask and cause irritation, they also didn‚Äôt fit very well they felt to small."
2.0,"I bought a 7.5 in the pink bunny slippers.  While they seemed to cozy, the sizing was off.  The sole of the slipper was larger than my daughter's size 7/8 slipper yet the opening to get them on was so small, and the room inside for her foot was VERY tight.  The width of the slippers was normal, but it was a very narrow space from the bottom of her foot to the top of her foot which made them too tight and uncomfortable for her."
2.0,It fits on the head very oddly.
2.0,"when I tried this outfit on my little man, to my surprise it fits small.  Its not 12-24mos, its more like 6-12mos. The hat is too small too (and no, my son does not have a big head!)<br />I was very is appointed! I really wanted him to wear it for Sunday games."
2.0,"The material is light and see through but the color is nice. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and the front part was too long, I could fit 3‚Äù of it under my feet. The top part barely covered my clevage. Its a nice style but its not for me."
2.0,Its so small its like a choker
2.0,"These sunglasses were of good quality; however, I would not say they are worth the price that I paid ($24.95), so I returned them.  There is a glare within the glasses...meaning I could see the reflection of my eyes when looking through the lens.  The polarization is also not very good."
2.0,"I am only giving this two stars because it looks like the picture. Other then that, I hate the way it feels on my skin, and it snags on my clothes. :( very annoying... I don't recommend buying this."
2.0,Instructions wasnt the best tops did not fit no matter the adjustment makes you have horrible over bit and cant talk and kept the bottoms in maybe an hour and they started fading
2.0,I tried this on in a medium and looked like a team member of the local high school wrestling team. Lol. Not the look I was going for. I sent it back and ordered the one with the wide leg to better accommodate these hips of mine.
2.0,"As a woman with a larger chest this particular vest didn't work well for me. The fit was high and snug; the bottles hit my chin while running given the high placement, the material chaffed both sides of my neck and one of the pull ties snapped off on the second use. Again, it wasn't a win for me but may work very well for somebody else as there are postive reviews out there."
2.0,"The seem line at the toes drives me nuts as it feels bulky. I'm going to get rid of them sadly. I want to love them and keep them, but like an X their time has passed."
2.0,The belt loop hook is too small for most pants and the string is very small
2.0,"Lanyard material itself is fine, its adjustable in length which is nice also. The clips that attach to the mask itself are poor quality and do not stay on while washing. My kids wear lanyards daily to school and 3 out of 4 lanyards purchased are now missing the clips."
2.0,Super cute however the material is very thin. More like a leggings than yoga pants.
2.0,I didn‚Äôt realize how large these were!  They are pretty but too much for me.
2.0,I bought this to wear with a corset for a Medieval Festival which worked out great. Unfortunately the elastic stitching at the waist is defective/uneven and I cannot wear it without something covering it it's so bad. I would have returned it but I needed something to wear to the festival so now I'm stuck with it. Other than the stitching the Garment fitwell and the material seems nice
2.0,If you are looking for a bathrobe without a belt this is it. Color is more beige than blush. I would not where this out..the fabric is way too much like a cheap bathrobe. Im returning it.
2.0,"I ordered 2 of this. Although they are beautiful, both sets had one clasp that didnt work."
2.0,Nose piece fell off
2.0,neat design but not crafted well and low quality materials
2.0,"These pants are okay. But they aren‚Äôt like the photo. The waist is super long. I have to roll the waistband to have it fit properly. It‚Äôs just a strange fit. And the back pockets are really high up as well. The bottom tip of the back pockets are level with my tailbone. Which makes the pockets useless since I have to roll the waist band, because I can‚Äôt get into the top part of the pockets.<br />But the legs and hips area fit fine. The fabric is okay, seems to breath decently well.<br />I have worn and washed these a few time now and the fabric is already starting to ‚Äúpeel‚Äù in the thigh area."
2.0,"cheap looking! we got it for my daughters vb coach and i almost did not want to give it to her, came in a little plastic bag...packaged like junk!"
2.0,"Very cute but small. Usually wear a medium and had to return. Mostly because it was so tight in the chest area and I'm a B cup. I couldn't fully lift my arms. Also, it was hard to zip up by myself. I wanted to exchange for a larger size but that wasn't an option so I returned it. I got it on lightning deal and didn't want to miss the deal so I didn't re-order"
2.0,not a good fit. bad return policy.
2.0,it was way too smal
2.0,The ball that holds it together kept unscrewing. I lost it the third or so time I wore it. The lava rock did not absorb the oil
2.0,"Left dust all over the place! Very weird texture compared to other polishing cloths, too."
2.0,I first ordered the Ipaca print and sent it back because the placement of fabric was not appealing as there were full bodies and heads were cut off. I sent it back and reordered the Walrus print and it had the same issue.  The wallet itself is great but the cut of fabric is very disappointing.
2.0,"These were poorly made pants with Chinese labels and had an error where one of the pockets was sewn into the outside seam of the pants. I returned them, and would not recommend anyone purchase them."
2.0,Came very wrinkled. Not enough bust room. I returned it.
2.0,"I never leave a bad review for anyone but I ordered a size XL in the navy blue and white printed dress and I‚Äôm not impressed to say the least!<br />The dress arrived without a sewn in tag anywhere indicating the actual size and it was way too small.<br />Not even sure if it was actually an extra large that was sent.... I‚Äôm not a large person... 5‚Äô1 tall,130 lbs, size 36C, normally size 8-10 clothing.<br />The length of the dress is perfect and so are the sleeves, they‚Äôre not tight . The rayon fabric and the pattern of the dress is lovely...but it‚Äôs not chiffon, It‚Äôs a heavier rayon.  The worst part about this dress is the top of the fits nothing like it shown in the picture.The bustline gapes open so much that you will absolutely and definitely need to wear something underneath it or have to pin it . Also, the band around the waistline in the front where the wraparound ties go cut you off in the middle, not enough fabric to go all the way across...  looks ridiculous! The skirt is not as full and flowing as it‚Äôs shown.<br />I ordered a few other dresses from this company and loved them!  Maybe this style dress isn‚Äôt for me or they sent the wrong size ....<br />Sending it back for refund."
2.0,Very cute to look at but made with a horrible able stiff material that feel like cardboard. Fits good except very short!! U can see my bum when leaning over.
2.0,"This a clean and minimal watch for seemingly good price. However, it simply does not hold up to the test of time. This watch lasted about 5 months before it went kaput. Here are the details:<br /><br />After 5 months, this $40 dollar watch died on me. The glass face scratched, the leather began to come apart, and the time displayed was not reliable. This is extremely disappointing because I've read so many good reviews and thus had high hopes for this beautiful timepiece. I am a teacher and keeping track of time is really important, but this watch couldn't deliver.<br /><br />This is a well-designed, clean and light watch that will last you about 6 months. If you're okay with that, its a good buy. Otherwise, I think you should look elsewhere."
2.0,"I think it was the second day my teen wore it and the green charm just fell off. I added a jump ring to hang the charm back on, then an hour later the chain broke. It was a bummer. Really really cute though"
2.0,The dress was really small and tight. I got a medium and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 125 pounds and it was really tight and didn‚Äôt zip
2.0,These are really cute but small for an adult female face so better suited to a child's face but most importantly they are only one layer so they really don't provide you with any protection so they can't be used
2.0,"The fit want great, but I wouldn't dealt with it except the material was so thin that you could see my underwear through it which isn't something I feel comfortable with especially at the gym."
2.0,"Warm and cozy but green is not as pictured,<br />Definitely an olive which I‚Äôm not crazy about"
2.0,"I ordered this bag to travel with. While it is a great size, the straps are too small and I don't want to have use it as a crossbody. It is not leather and has a terrible smell. Also, I ordered the grey and it is definitely brown. I gave it to a lady I work with and she is going to use it as a diaper bag. I would not recommend ordering this."
2.0,On the small side.  Soft fabric but thin.
2.0,"I ordered  this NEW for my granddaughter. Too bad I didn‚Äôt open it sooner because it was a used coat! No belt and a used chapstick in the pocket. I paid for a NEW coat! Fortunately she liked it so much, I cut the belt loops off. I was so upset. Thankfully she doesn‚Äôt know the difference in the look. I would have sent it back BUT she needed it now. What‚Äôs going on with the shipping department?  I will never order from this place again!"
2.0,"Was beautiful but it was to short for mr, waist to high and I didn‚Äôt like the sling colored lining, I felt naked and I‚Äôm a senior.  Otherwise for the young"
2.0,"Zipper busted and I had it on for maybe two seconds?  I was really disappointed. It's a beautiful and flattering dress :(  I even had an extra TWO INCHES room, so it wasn't that it was too small.  So sad...."
2.0,The pin itself is gigantic.
2.0,"The product does not have cups. It states soft cups without padding. No cups, only double lined."
2.0,"I recently broke my nose and my coach wouldn't let me play without a mask , but the view from his is horrible , specially playing basketball , you feel trapped inside a hole and can only see trough 2 little holes , the way it sits on my face is great very comfy but the view from it is horrible don't recommend for basketball"
2.0,"The item is large enough however, the  Loc cap will not stay on my head while sleeping."
2.0,The earrings are not as pictured .<br />The size is very tiny and the color barely has a tint of pink to them.
2.0,"My kids are in swimming and needed googles. I purchased it for my 3 year old but he said it hurts. I then had my 8 and 11 year old try it on and they also said that it hurts. Not sure if ours was defective. When asked they said that the eye piece dig into their eyes too much. I tried loosing the band but my 11 year old said that it gave her a headache. I also tried it on and it really sucks into your eyes and wasn't comfortable. I would want googles to have good suction where water doesn't get in but these were not comfortable. I was worried that the smiley face would prevent vision but it is light, though I would prefer the bling to not be on the lenses.<br /><br />We did not try it on water so can not comment on whether it was anti-fog or prevents wanted from coming in. Comfort is very important and since none of the kids were willing to wear it for an entire lesson, it was hard to review other aspects of the googles. I have it 2 stars for the cute design. Unfortunately these googles didn't work out for us.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange or my honest and unbiased review. Promotion was not influenced by review."
2.0,This fit so poorly! Very large and the pocket was droopy
2.0,"I purchased this to keep small items in, like my cell phone while I underwent radiation and chemotherapy for lung cancer. 2 of the 4 zippers are torn away from the bag. Anything can fall out."
2.0,Arms of dress are very narrow. It wrinkles like crazy when washed. Will not purchase another.
2.0,I was a little disappointed in the quality of the fabric.  Rather thin to say the least.
2.0,"These stockings looked super cute on, but they absolutely disintegrated after one wash. They got runs from the smallest things, and you couldn‚Äôt possibly get more than one or two wears out of each pair. Colors matched the photo, they were only a little itchy. For cosplay or an outfit once, great. Not going to last."
2.0,No very pretty.  The colors are not true to the photo - much more dull.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6a1b9724d68fd85a66a338561bfc8766]] They‚Äôre cute but is it me or is it spelling out Biide instead of Bride? Also I hate the white felt background and maybe I missed it but the listing doesn‚Äôt show that part. Won‚Äôt be using.
2.0,I loved them. As I had bought them for all my best friends. So I had bought four. But after a week of being on our key chains the tassels fell off.
2.0,"They look nice, but they dont fit and they arent what I thought they would be. I expected a thinner glove to work in."
2.0,"Waist band is heavy duty like 4 inches of sewn in elastic.  Too tight, leaves marks on my waist from wearing.  I had previously ordered same size in other colors from same company, and they have a normal elastic waist band, and were perfect."
2.0,So cute but I have bought two pairs and they broke without any trauma
2.0,"I liked the material the style and color.  I put the dress on and it fit every where except for my mid section.  It was tight around my stomach, butt and hips.  I do not like to have any rolls showing at anytime and this dress was tight.  I am 5'7 and 139lbs and I purchased a M. I think the large would be to large."
2.0,I don‚Äôt know how this product has high rate..<br />It‚Äôs so cheap and poor kind nylon fabric
2.0,Does not conform to face.
2.0,The double hooks dig into my back. Can't lay on back when exercising
2.0,I bought an XL and it honestly looked like a small. It was so tiny
2.0,"Somewhat sheer... More importantly, one of the buttons popped off right as I got to work."
2.0,"Cheap. Looks cheap, feels cheap, drapes like it's cheap. You get what you pay for."
2.0,THE SIZE WAS NOT TRUE TO SIZE
2.0,fine at first then it broke after about 2 weeks..i sewed it back together but DO NOT BUY!!
2.0,Be aware that all the colors are not all the same style & fabric! Some have a soft fleece lining (nice) and some do not have any lining at all.  Some are hoodies and some are dowel neck and the description is not always accurate. For this purchase it describes a cowl neck but it was actually a hoodie.  The first one I bought in November was a cowl neck with a fleece lining & pockets as described. And even though it said I should get an  XXL it was too big. I got an XL & it was perfect.
2.0,bulkier than I imagined
2.0,"At first glance, I absolutely loved this skirt. It's nice thick fabric and longer than I expected since everyone says it's short. I'm almost 5'9.<br /><br />But it was wayyyy too big compared to the measurements on the fitting chart.<br /><br />My real problem came when I went to wear it, the very FIRST time. I hadn't even woren it around the house, it was in my closet waiting for be worn for months. I got it on no issue, since it was a little too big I tightened the strings a tiny bit on the front, because I wasn't going to let it being a little too big keep me from wearing it. And I wore it long enough to get ready.<br /><br />I went to fix the string, as I was pulling just a little, to bow the strings together, one of the metal pieces completely ripped out of the skirt. And I can't put the metal back in place. It ripped too big a hole to put back.<br /><br />I was super disappointed, I wanted to give this a 5 star. But I couldn't even tie the bow without it breaking before I left the house. (Thankfully)"
2.0,"This ""dress"" is so sheer it should not be called a dress.  It's a cover-up.  Very disappointing because, the fit was perfect.  This item was sent back."
2.0,Fit as expected but was very very sheer and see through. The skits on the side were very high and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5
2.0,Sin calidad en costuras<br />Ni intrucciones de lavado
2.0,This costume is very cute and is sized correctly but it does not stay inflated for more than about 30 seconds. You would really need to have a portable phone recharger to make this work so that you‚Äôre constantly inflating as it continues to deflate.
2.0,To small waiting for refund
2.0,After 2nd wash the product faded dramatically and it attracted SOO much fuzz from anything that touched it. :(
2.0,"The inside is cracking already, up around the calf, it is really hard and stiff, not good for the price paid."
2.0,"The leather was thinner than I expected. Also, when bent the opposite curvature of the waists, it has a blistered look.  (Not a good sign for long term usage.)<br /><br />I was looking for a HIGH quality belt.  This didn‚Äôt do it for me."
2.0,The zipper literally broke after first time use.
2.0,"The straps don't unclip, to tighten them you have to pull them backwards which is very awkward, they don't stay as tight as you set them and immediately loosen because they are loose elastic, and the face mask is not attached in any way, it's a separate piece you have to tie on around your head. Also, when tightened anywhere close to tight the strap adjusters sit right under your arms, which is quite uncomfortable.<br />This is a really odd setup for a hood, and not what I was expecting."
2.0,Very figure flattering. Runs small. Wayyyyyyy toooo thin of fabric
2.0,These sandals do not look anything like the picture and are quite ugly. I gave them to the Goodwill so I don‚Äôt have a picture that I can use to post on here. Ugly and really uncomfortable!
2.0,I get that they aren't supposed to be form fitting but it is very big with no structure. Colors not as bold as pictured
2.0,Cheaply made and insufficient space for things.
2.0,These shirts are great as described but the sizing runs a bit big. I feel they run about 1 size too big. If you want a more true fit order 1 size down. Order normal size if you like a bit of room.
2.0,Style (back) was not as expected.
2.0,The ones without at the grooves don‚Äôt work. I use the one with the grooves & it hold my ring for the most but when I‚Äôm doing normal things it comes off
2.0,"Though the dress looks good, the material is not great, from a single wear, it got lot of wear and tear. I have bought other dresses from the brand and they seem to be fine."
2.0,Not as pretty as shown in photo.  Dull appearance
2.0,Two stars because it's so cute & i love the size but it smells horrible. I don't know how to get rid of the smell so I'm returning it.
2.0,The shirt runs a bit small.
2.0,"My son used these ears for a costume for a halloween party at Disney. The ears worked for their purpose of having the costume, but buyers should note that the ears are much smaller than Mickey Mouse ears generally are and are also quite flimsy. The material was pulling away from the headband within an hour of wearing them."
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt hold my change well .. always falling everywhere in my purse
2.0,Really cute but sole came loose in 3 days
2.0,"The dress is so big I can't tell if it would be cute in a smaller size, or not. It fits me like a potato sack. I'm only 5'4"" and the length falls just above my knee, a little shorter than I like. The sizing is really off. It's 100% cotton & had terrible wrinkles, so definitely need to iron."
2.0,"Fabric and fit is nothing like the picture. If you‚Äôd like that fit, I‚Äôd size up 2. Definitely returning."
2.0,This is a poorly made top. The sleeves are oddly short hitting just above my wrists. It‚Äôs definitely not as long as I would have liked. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and wanted something that covered my rear to wear with leggings. This isn‚Äôt the top for that.  After the first wash the material feels cheap and like it‚Äôs not going to handle many more washes.
2.0,"I got two of the same shirt. The material is okay, just kind of heavy if you are using the shirts for working out"
2.0,"I ordered and XL which according to their size chart would fit a 16/18, which I am. They are more like a medium, so if you are bigger than a size 10 or have any hips or thighs I would stay away from these. Also I am 5'1 and they fit me like at actual pant length not cropped on me at all. I just sold them at a yard sale. Which is a bummer because I really liked the print and they are nicely made."
2.0,"For reference I'm 5'3&#34; and 120lbs.  I got the 3 pack with grey/red/black.  The high waist goes up to the bottom of my ribs and does NOT offer any compression for me.  I know it's because they are a &#34;one size fits most&#34; product so if you are slim and looking for the compression, these won't work.  Also the legs are not long, they hit above my ankles and I'm not very tall!  They are also baggy at the ankle.  I have no idea why, most people have skinnier ankles than calves but these are just as wide in the ankle as the calf area which I don't like but I plan to cover that part with leg warmers or taller socks.<br />After wearing for half a day, the material has started to rub and pill.  I know other fleece leggings on Amazon have this same problem from reading reviews so it seems a common issue.<br />It was pretty cold this morning around 20¬∞F and I rode my bike to school with the kids while wearing these leggings.  My legs were cold but it was bearable since I was constantly moving them.  I was only out for maybe 15-20 min and I think I could have done longer if I wanted,  maybe 45 min at that temperature with these leggings.  Later today I went to the store and the temperature had risen to about 40¬∞ and these leggings were perfectly warm.<br />2 stars because it's a good price for a 3-pack but they should be longer without baggy ankles and having a couple of size options would sure help!"
2.0,ummm it didnt do anything!!! My arms still look fat and gross.
2.0,These are cute but one was broken when I opened the box.
2.0,"Decent quality. Not anywhere close to thigh highs tho, not even over the knee. Pretty small overall, not much stretch"
2.0,"While attempting to adjust the fit with the lacing that surrounds the opening where your foot goes into the actual material of the upper tore through.  I wouldn't recommend this particular slipper if you believe that you will have to adjust the fit as I needed to, you may end up with material failure like I did.  I sent these back for a refund as they were useless once the material failed, they were too loose to begin with."
2.0,Material was poor
2.0,Print was nice but the slippery material made them ride down below my cotton underwear. I had to constantly pull the up. Would not recommend.
2.0,"This shirt was cute, but the fit was weird. The arm holes were big and stuck out from your body. Not flattering. Returned."
2.0,It is as gift do I have not tried it. We will see after Christmas. I do not have a lot of hope for its success because the word ‚Äústeps‚Äù is spelled incorrectly on the BOX so may be returning it. I don‚Äôt mind things made in other countries but there are spell checkers that include languages.
2.0,too wide!! really like the dress look but too short and material - bathing suit like material
2.0,It‚Äôs ok the fabric poor did not do good in the washer
2.0,"It's my first pair of computer glasses. I didn't realized that they were so reflective. It's impossible to be on a video conference wearing them - people would see the reflection of your screen instead of your eyes. Will have to return.<br />Otherwise, they are good looking and comfortable."
2.0,Nice shirt but the size is not even close to american standard.
2.0,"I'm sure they'd be great if they fit the boots I have, but they did not come with laces or leather straps and you need two per boot to lace them up.<br />The leather themselves seem well made though I question the durability of the zipper.  Would not by this version again."
2.0,Beautiful item from the beginning but brakes down within a week!
2.0,"I bought these for my husband because his pair that was similar to these broke. However, he told me hes not too happy with these because it's not wide enough to cover his peripheral vision. He's still wearing his broken ones (super glued) - this would tell you how he feels about these..."
2.0,"This product is very cheap and runs very small.  When I took it out of the bag I looked at the tag, which appeared like it was a sticker me came right off.  Would not recommend spending the money."
2.0,"Did fit as expected, too awkward."
2.0,Good quality material and straps are comfortable but I ordered my correct bra size and it was too tight so size up.
2.0,"I know the shirt is intended to be looser fit, but I ordered my normal size and feel like I ordered up 2 sizes too big!"
2.0,"Great pattern, but very cheap quality.  Wore them twice, and huge, big holes appeared in the heel."
2.0,Way to baggy and long legged.  Not happy about the fit.
2.0,"The pictures of the product are really bright and crisp. The actual product is much more dull and not as sharp. The size couldn't be more wrong. I'm 6'1"" and weigh about 210-215lbs and I wear an XL in everything from shirts to jackets so I ordered an XL. The fit is more like a medium short. I'm returning this and I will order a 3XL."
2.0,They look cool but you can tell they're cheaply made
2.0,It did not look like the picture at all. It was huge on me (XL) and I ordered based on the measurement in the size guide.
2.0,"The bands seem nice enough and they fit into the watch, but I looked at the measurement listing to be sure that they would fit because my wrists are on the smaller side.  The listing says that it fits wrists as smal as 5.5"".  Usually the bands with this measurement fit perfectly but these are not advertised properly.  I measured my wrists at 6"" and you can see in the photo the amount of space on the smallest hole.  Some of the health functions of the watch require a tighter fit."
2.0,Entirely too small and could not wear
2.0,"Pretty top, but runs REALLY small."
2.0,Size was to small !!!
2.0,The shape was taller than expected -- not very fashionable.
2.0,"Doesn't look that good, looks really cheap and definitely don't have the colors as in the picture. Is just white"
2.0,Dress was adorable but size chart is WAY off. We ended up returning the dress; need to order at least 2 sizes larger than size chart suggests.
2.0,would work fine if it fit
2.0,"Because I have neuropathy in my feet, I expected Berks to be comfortable, but found the footbed was stiff and hard, thus not soft and comfortable. They went back and I probably won't buy this brand since the footbeds in all the shoes appear to be the same.  Also, the cost of shipping was prohibitive, nearly half the price of the shoe ($32.00)!"
2.0,I agree with the others ... weird pockets. Returned
2.0,too big and loose
2.0,"This is a flimsy excuse for a singers mask. Do to the fact that I need it as a teacher and the other masks out there don't work well for me, I might try to modify it, but will probably return it.  Key problems:<br />1) It's polyester. Totally breath-restricting.<br />2) It has no structure; no wire or anything to hold it away from your face.<br />3) It STINKS! Smells like plastic from a factory when you put it on."
2.0,I usually wear an 8 or 10 but ordered a 12.  It was so tight at the bustl line that it felt more like a junior size 7.  Will have to try the next size up.  Thank God it's eligible for free returns?
2.0,The fit is weird. Love the colors. The neck is short!
2.0,It was way too thick and the material was not nice looking
2.0,The front stripes and the back stripes did not match up. I re-ordered a large size and found that the XXL was the same size as the XL. My normal size is a 10-12.  I am 5'10 and 170lbs. The length of the dress was not quite ling enough. I was disappointed because I really liked the style of the dress.
2.0,"I got pretty much what the description said, though I have doubts on the quality of the metal.  It is darker than the picture no matter what light I put it under.  It also bears no stamping that usually comes with gold jewelry.  The pearls have banding/indentation, though they are real I'm pretty sure.  I would probably return, but it costs more to ship than the item."
2.0,"This dress did not look at all how I thought it would. Rather than a burgundy color it is brown, it‚Äôs made on very this material that in certain lights is transparent, doesn‚Äôt have any volume, and the neck line is very tight fitting. Just not what I was expecting"
2.0,the material soaks up sweat smell... I wore it maybe twice and it already smells horrible! (and im not a smelly person- i promise) I don't recommend buying this unless you're one of those people who never sweats. The material is clearly pretty cheap however it looks as it should. It also fit a bit small but otherwise I have nothing to say
2.0,The watch itself is nice but the band is terrible and doesn‚Äôt stay clasped.
2.0,The eyebrow ring variety is nice but very cheaply made and the balls break in half for no reason. I could be screwing on one of the ends and the ball will just break apart even though I'm gently screwing on the end. I have already lost four rings because of that so I'm very disappointed!
2.0,Material is too flimsy
2.0,"Not as great as they say they are, my wife feet are still cold when she gets home from work of a evening."
2.0,Print isn't as nice as picture.
2.0,Chain clasp broke within two days of receiving it
2.0,Not a lot of coolant beads . So distal cool. But far as just a visor works fine.
2.0,Seams started coming apart in several places after the first wash.  I'm surprised they would make the quality so low.
2.0,"Although the goggles are comfortable, I cannot get them to have a tight seal on my face; consequently, the goggles leak.  Because they are comfortable, I will continue to try to adjust them for a tighter fit so that they don't leak."
2.0,"Look cheap,which they are.Had them for a couple months before one of them broke,glued it few times,then I trew them away"
2.0,"Got these for my boyfriend but he cold never wear them because they are not very long, depth wise."
2.0,Doesn't stay on.
2.0,Grandma Dress
2.0,"For this price, I wasn't expecting anything luxurious.  However, this is entirely too small and EXTREMELY cheaply made.  I would return it if I could."
2.0,"It's a pretty ring, but I bought another one for way cheaper and it looks like they got the wrong price tags.  Keeping the quality ring, not this overpriced piece.  The setting is very thin."
2.0,"These run a little small and after only a month, they are ripped. I bought them as a gift and was disappointed in their quality."
2.0,"When you have pain, even a little relief is welcomed. Hope drove my decision to buy this product but it has not delivered any relief.  Bummer!!!<br />Glad it has helped others, disappointed it didn't happen for me."
2.0,Not comfortable and a little small.
2.0,These took forever to arrive and when I took them out if the package they fell on the floor and broke in half.
2.0,Does not stay closed.  Recommend adding a button on the inside to secure.
2.0,they were received long before due date. they are huge i wanted something smaller like a 1 inch hoop. It is hard to tell how big something is from a picture
2.0,"MUCH shorter than expected. I don't see anywhere in the details about the size. Based on another review with photos, it seems like it should be somewhat long, like a mini dress. The one I received was 17 inches (about 43 cm) long; reaching my hips, but not covering them. And it isn't loose on me at all, it's almost like a fitted shirt. The sleeves do reach about 2-3 inches away from my elbow. I can still wear this shirt, but not the way I had wished to."
2.0,"awkward fit, too sloppy looking on..."
2.0,They are nice but  have another brand I like better.
2.0,"As you might expect, one can practically watch TV through this shirt."
2.0,Material is thin and sizes run small.  Order 2 sizes up.
2.0,This is a thick tshirt material and it is white and green.  Not pink and green.  It is nice but not at all what I ordered.
2.0,"Very small and poorly made. It‚Äôs a cute idea, but the cup feels as though it‚Äôs a paper roll covered in fabric. We ended up returning due to the price for what we got, the quality, and we didn‚Äôt see it lasting beyond a few weeks. We ended up doing a DIY version using a hot glue, a small stuffed animal, fluffy sock, and small plastic cup."
2.0,Nice look and feel but size was much smaller than most brands
2.0,"Fabric wasn't what I expected -- it felt rubbery.  I expected that a stretch fabric wouldn't feel like cotton or silk, but this was almost like a sheet of plastic or rubber.  I imagine it would be very uncomfortable in hot weather!  Color was great, though -- too bad the feel of the fabric was so bad!  I returned the dress."
2.0,"I really wanted to love these hats! I ordered several from this company including one that was a ""floppy"" style. I'm an African-American with natural hair and the hats are stretched to the max when I put them on my head over my afro. This is frustrating because my natural hair has a tight curl pattern with a lot of shrinkage meaning afro is not that large at all. If you have straight hair, you will probably have better luck. They are at least well constructed."
2.0,Bigger than I thought it would be. Heavy face flops to underside of my wrist. Returned.
2.0,it too small like them a little larger
2.0,It is not flexible enough. Would love one made out of softer material.
2.0,Very low quality item. The buttons were about to fall off before he even tried it on. If I can ever find time I'll be stopping at the UPS store and completing my return of this item.
2.0,Not what I expected! Thought the bank would be wider but it was not and it should be for larger breasted women!
2.0,Not the best material...hole in one pocket
2.0,Tie dye is printed on fabric. Fabric is very stiff. Wouldn't recommend
2.0,The slots for cards are top loading...not on inside seam like I am used to...do not feel that they would hold upper row of cards safely...expected better from Buxton brand.
2.0,It broke the first time I put it on my daughter's head. The stitch broke in different places.
2.0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. NOT GOOD QUALITY REALLY THIN MATERIAL  NOT SEWED TOGETHER WELL
2.0,"To large to fit into a medium sized handbag. The leather was not supple or soft.<br /><br />Otherwise, an OK purse for the price.<br /><br />I returned it easily via Amazon Prime."
2.0,"I collect all kinds of watches; battery operated and mechanical, name brand and off brand, cheap and expensive, so I have some experience and appreciation for watches. I am scratching my head on this one? For this kind of money and the fact that is looks like a divers watch, you would expect it to be able to take some water? Jump in the pool or the shower? But no. I have tried to do some research on the Aivasee brand, but not a whole lot of info? So why is this a nearly $500 watch?<br /><br />The band is different and where it attaches to the watch it is solid, not hollow, so it is a nice band (not sure most men would wear it), but that doesn't make it worth $450 dollars. The movement is 21-jewels, but again I have watches that cost half as much with 21-jewels. It is a pretty watch and keeps good time, but I feel this is way over-priced. Overall I am not that impressed."
2.0,"Returned, too small for adults.  Also had a weird smell."
2.0,Ok dress for price
2.0,Odd pocket configuration and sized way too large.
2.0,liked these very much but the clasp wouldn't stay kept coming out my ear
2.0,This dress is cute but it is way to small. I have also found it is see through in several spots. It makes a great cover up for a bathing suit but that's about all I can use it for.<br /><br />I did receive this item for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  These words are my own.
2.0,"They look cute but can't wear them, way too big on me."
2.0,"I ordered this blouse thinking it had a small collar but it just has a trim on the V-neck that is folded down in the picture.  I need a collar to play golf, and the blouse fits very loose so it was too large for me.  Also, the material was too &#34;scratchy&#34; to wear next to my skin.  I returned the blouse.."
2.0,Could've saved my money and bought this from a local store...
2.0,Muy frajil material y la luz dejo de funcionar
2.0,"It seems a little stiff, but soft. It smells HORRIBLE right out of the package though. I'm just kinda disappointed, but if my opinion changes (when it smells better and loosens up) I'll change my review."
2.0,"I ordered two pairs of these thanks to the new HR person at work who decided to implement a wildly unpopular business casual dress code. I took one look at my closet full of comfy jeggings, panicked, and began buying non-denim jeggings wherever I could find them.<br /><br />So these are...all right. The charcoal colored ones I could wear because at a distance they could fool you into thinking they are dress-pant fabric. However, the dark green ones looked awful. Both weren't skin-tight on me but the green ones looked somehow transparent and stretched over my skin. The green dye pulls apart and reveals white-ish colored spandex and you look like you're wearing barely opaque tights instead of actual pants. Even more obscene is that both pairs caused an alarming amount of dromedary-related horror all up in my business area. Unless your stuffy HR lady is into that you'll need to wear a tunic-length top to cover that nonsense up."
2.0,"Material is very soft. Only complaint, even after several washes the colors bleed bad...sweat from a 5 year old dyed her hair and neck"
2.0,"This mask is adequate, but I had to put a dot on one side of each, as it's impossible to tell the front and back of this mask. For those who don't wear this mask constantly, (i.e. take it off in the car, etc. ) this will be a problem."
2.0,"too small no stretch in the fabric. You have to put the Fasteners and tighteners on yourself, and made for people who don't have a gut or wide hips"
2.0,"This swimsuit is beautiful, I love those little pompoms. It fits alright, and the strap is adjustable (meaning you can tie it as tight as you like). There is no back, so I honestly do not know how the model on the picture is able to have that kind of push up cleavage effect. It's all very loose and does not have a push up effect. In fact it's the opposite. It does nothing to make it look good on the top. So while the color and design are lovely and clever, the top is not good. There is padding but unless you have got a pair of nice perfectly shaped b*r*e*a*s*t*s or tape them in some way, it will not look s*xy or attractive. I didn't like how it looked on me at all."
2.0,Seems a little off in the crotch area with extra material in the front
2.0,Not ideal for women with curves
2.0,This band is more like cardboard than leather.  It is very stiff.  It looks fine once it is on but it is hard to get on and off because it is so stiff.
2.0,"I liked that they have pockets, and I liked the silky feel of the pant, but they run small."
2.0,Ordered this for my 7-year-olds Halloween costume and it's very poorly made. The tail feathers and the material inside have a tear and the head won't stay up. Too close to Halloween to return. Bummer!
2.0,Poor quality. Didn't last through my 1 week vacation.
2.0,"Edit: after a couple of uses one of them doesn‚Äôt clasp at all anymore. If it does, it undoes itself with one touch. They are small and don‚Äôt clasp well so I don‚Äôt wear them anymore.<br /><br />Original: Technically 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è They‚Äôre cute, but smaller than I imagined. I was hoping to wear them in my middle piercing, but my lobe is too puffy there. The clasp doesn‚Äôt have much room for it. It works great for my normal piercing though!<br /><br />Easy to unsnap and snap on, they stay in well and don‚Äôt unclasp easily while wearing so you don‚Äôt have to worry about them falling out."
2.0,I have this shirt in Green and Black. Both perfect.  Returned the Red. It wasnt red it was a maroon Bordeaux color.not what I was looking for.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these shoes.  Unfortunately for me, they just did not work out and I sent them back.  The fit is a little large.  The sole is very stiff and unforgiving.  They are only just OK for walking and I would not recommend trying to run in them even trail running.  The look is great, I just found them not to be very comfortable."
2.0,These are very cute but not a smart purchase. They were very difficult to put on a wiggling 4 month old and he managed to get each off before I could get the other on. I bought these just for the cuteness factor and they were that.
2.0,"The is dress pretty, runs large, had to return twice as the black dye ran over into parts of the dress, near the breast area, not to attractive, but the seller was good about me returning the dress."
2.0,"It was the same shirt in a different color and the same size, fit totally differently. I was super disappointed because I love the color."
2.0,"Overall, the fit of this set is kinda off. The pants and sleeves are slightly too short and the fit is just kinda awkward. The fabric is nice though."
2.0,Was way too big and returned.
2.0,Fit small. Very narrow.
2.0,"I hate the fit of this product and it came with tags inside which I had to rip out.  Wish I had gone with another option.  I wear size 36 and bought the large.  Usually don't have a problem with multipack undergarments, but this one, wish I had my money back.  The material is good, I like the large waistband, just wish they actually fit my body."
2.0,after a month the lights on the left shoe stop working
2.0,Plastic seems cheaper than the price.
2.0,Very cute! My daughter loved them
2.0,Not the greatest zipper quality. I use it for holding supplies when training my dog and it works great for that.
2.0,Can‚Äôt adjust to a great fit.
2.0,too small...
2.0,"It is about five times SMALLER than shown in the photo.  The photo makes it appear as if it starts from the neckline down to your waist.  That is what I was counting on, for example, to wear with a white t-shirt.  It really appears to be a full bib necklace and I compared it with other photos and necklaces from the same company.  There are no dimensions listed, so we really have to rely on the photo which is extremely misleading.  I like everything about it other than that, but that is the most important feature and the only reason I bought it, for the size shown, as I was visualizing what it would look like on.  It may be too much trouble to return, so this is just for others....buyer be very aware of just how TINY it really is and seller, please use a more realistic photo and lose the one that falsely shows this as a much, much larger necklace.  I also bought the floral necklace from them and it was sized perfectly and shown as a true bib necklace.  It is just a problem with the way this one is extremely falsely advertised.  Happy shopping!! (My first Amazon review!  Wish I was able to give it a more positive one!)"
2.0,"If you have a dog or cat, forget these - they pick up pet hair like crazy.  They are also a bit long and narrow.  In person, they look cheaper than in the picture."
2.0,The hat is a little to small for a 1 year old it kind of tight fitting but definitely to small for any child older than 1
2.0,Cute but way way way to small
2.0,Expected material to be heavier
2.0,They tarnish quickly. You will need to apply clear nail polish on the earrings to extend the wear.
2.0,Band small-not comfortable
2.0,These were just too long and would not work. No way to shorten them enough to make them work.
2.0,It's totally synthetic. Miserable to wear more than a couple of minutes.
2.0,not cute! looks very cheap.
2.0,This is the third set of these socks I've purchased and all of them are soft but fall right off my ankles. I gotta stop buying them.
2.0,"I ordered a few sized up as suggested, still really small and very short. I am only 5'6&#34; and this is barely mid-shin."
2.0,Sent it back. The fit was weird. Too loose at the top but kind of fitted through the middle. The color was brighter than pictured.
2.0,"This dress needs some restructuring done to it .The chest area was to tight , while the body was a maternity could not wear it and I ordered my right size 18 w"
2.0,The top was too gappy. Should have fit more snuggly
2.0,Too narrow. Low quality material.
2.0,"This item fell apart within a few months of receiving it. It is supposed to be good for everyday use, yet the strap is already worn in places and ripped in others. The other reviews seemed pretty good, but the watch I received is pretty cheap and not worth the money spent on it."
2.0,You can't tell from the photo but the material is cheap and awful and the stripes are quite unbecoming.
2.0,The material is great. But they torn after 1 hour of wearing them. I‚Äôm so disappointed. The buttons are also cheap.
2.0,"I usually am true to size and rarely need to try on clothing to know it fits. This dress was smaller than the usual . And the colors were obnoxiously vibrant. I mean, extremely!"
2.0,"The wood is low quality, not sanded on edges, and pieces are stapled together.  My husband had to nail pieces together that came apart during shipment.  Too pricey for the quality."
2.0,This shirt feels a little too much like plastic. I wanted a soft flowy shirt and this is more stiff and feels like polyester.  Meh.
2.0,The large suitcase arrived damaged.  The screw was not aligned.  The other two suitcases were fine.
2.0,looks better online than in real life
2.0,I wear a size 20 and even the 3x was too small.
2.0,Chains on pants broke while trying them on & not d/t size. Smell of them were terrible even after wash I could still smell it. Oh & the chains broke before even wearing them
2.0,"This top is definitely NOT brown. In person, it is the orange color of a pumpkin. The cowlneck lays nice, but top is very short overall. Ordered a large, when usually in tops I wear a sm or med. This seller‚Äôs tops usually fit small, so ordered this in a large. It also has clearly been worn and washed and then resold. It smells strongly of detergent. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this top."
2.0,"When I opened my package this morning I immediately knew I was returning it due to material; very stiff-I expected it to be more of a linen look/feel. After closer observation this item had markings and lent all over so definitely returning‚Ä¶ I would not recommend this item, personally!"
2.0,Fine as a light jacket until it gets wet. Water soaks right through. So disappointing!
2.0,This is not at all the color that I expected it to be so I am returning it.
2.0,"If compared to Burton or Lorpen ski socks, these are far more like lightweight spring socks. They are not at all warm and not meant for winter wearing. I put in the ski closet for guests but these will get relegated to spring only use."
2.0,I ordered 2 sizes bigger bc I knew that it was coming from China and they tend to run smaller. It was still was too small. I will no longer be ordering clothing that is shipping from china.
2.0,I normally wear a size L. I purchased the XL just to be safe. It fit me like it was an XXS. Other than the sizing the costume would have been great.
2.0,"The necklace arrived when promised, and as others have said the jewelry was in a nice box. Two problems though... the chain is much too fine, and the clasp is much too small and very difficult to open and close. I wish I had gone with a bigger diamond chip. The jewelry is attractively designed."
2.0,"I‚Äôm returning it. I don‚Äôt like the fabric, it is very cheap feeling, and I don‚Äôt like the Velcro fastener. It is very long and thick , holds well , but gets stuck on parts of the wrap you don‚Äôt want it on. It is also not comfortable fastener"
2.0,"Very thin, itchy, sweat stain visible."
2.0,too highly priced for the make (((((
2.0,Glasses were too wide.  Too bad because I really was looking forward to a pair of Vuarnet sun glasses
2.0,"I normally wear a medium and even with the measurement guide this ran a little large, but not so much it isn't wearable. The lacing at the top is nice. The color in the cloth though is not as solid or consistent as in the picture.  On mine, the dye job it is faded at the seams and in some places non-existent. It almost gives it a tie-dye look in spots.  I also question how well it will run through the wash, though I have not tried it yet."
2.0,looks fake...I guess this is because it is!
2.0,Tried several times to get them to stick on as instructed.  Too thick.  Don't work.
2.0,Pretty but larger then I was thinking
2.0,"Something about the straps... I first wore it for a pool party and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so pretty because it looks like I‚Äôm wearing a maxi dress, but woah!  It‚Äôs a swim cover!‚Äù  And then I walked by a mirror. And thought, ‚ÄúAm I being choked by a black shoelace?‚Äù  It just looks... weird. It doesn‚Äôt lay right.  I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Yes, I did know how to put it on. I‚Äôm not going to say I figured it out on the first try. But I *did* figure it out. And it just looked odd and unflattering."
2.0,"Within the first week I lost two screws, not a high quality pair of sunglasses, but I knew that when purchasing. Just needed something to get me by...almost"
2.0,Ordered an XL because the L was out of stock. It was very baggy and unshapely... like a sack. And the dress material was very thin- would definitely need a slip underneath. The sleeves were pretty though. Returned.
2.0,Very cute keychain! Only issue I have is that the paint was chipped off and its very noticeable.
2.0,"Very, very small....not at all comparable to U.S. Sizes"
2.0,"Wish I had taken a pic. Ordered a medium, expecting a fit as advertised on the gentleman that is shown wearing, as we appear to be a similar build. Unfortunately, the sweater fit more like a Double XL.<br /><br />Was refunded right away via Amazon. However, the seller isn‚Äôt showing that I sent the sweater back, even though I shipped it a few days after receiving it."
2.0,This is very small for a 2X
2.0,This thing is HUGE. The prongs are weird. Unimpressive.
2.0,"I'm a size 12 5'6"" and this is so bunchy around the waist it makes my waist look larger than it is."
2.0,"Love the feel of the fabric, love the print, unfortunately there were weird folds sewed into the shoulder. The left lay flat and smooth like it should, the right shoulder the stitching was messed up. Very disappointed with how great of reviews it got."
2.0,Looks nice easy to put in. I went to sleep the first night with it and it came out... I hope I find it in my sheets üò°
2.0,Much harder then shown. Very thick plastic. So i had to trim it down in order to breathe better.  I wouldn't but again.
2.0,Very small area actually is heated. Wouldn't recommend for cold weather.
2.0,"Runs way too small (I ordered a 3x, and it fits like an XL)."
2.0,Wouldn't recommend. Size 2x is more of a 16w then the 18w/20w according to the size chart. I regularly (comfortably) wear a 18w and these fit quite small. Fit just barely but too snug for my taste
2.0,Super short and sexy but not what I was looking for.
2.0,It is way longer than it looks on the model.  Or perhaps I am extremely short.
2.0,Item NOT described as mentioned. These are NOT thermal fleeced lined. Seller needs to correct! Also...I didn't like how they fit. Compared to other leggings and yoga pants I've bought from other sellers these are not flattering at all. The material seems cheap/thin and the top portion of the pants adds an extra buldge unlike other pants that help tuck and add support.
2.0,Cute but had an odor and shed all over my clothes.
2.0,The stone/ruby is very very very small and the chain is thin tbh not happy with it but it was a gift for some one else and they like it.
2.0,"The top looks very different in the photos than it does when it arrived. It was quite short and boxy in style. I was also not  fan of the material, which was like a somewhat shiny spandex. I ended up returning it."
2.0,Beautiful detail. Shoes were half a size too small.
2.0,size runs big
2.0,Unfortunately when i received it I thought this was going to be of higher quality. It's just a sticker
2.0,These shorts are so cute but the fit is weird. They fit perfectly in the waist but the shorts part fit like a thong.
2.0,The inside liner (satin material) makes the hat slip off very easily. The color is nice but the fact that it won‚Äôt stay on means it will be gifted to someone else.
2.0,THe wierd clasp let loose and my watch fell off.  Not good with a $600 watch.
2.0,Husband says too big + doesn't stay up
2.0,"Zipper broke off at the end at the very first use, material is not sturdy. i would not recommend"
2.0,Wouldn't recommend the earrings are not the same size.
2.0,This was listed as a youth shirt but when it arrived it was clearly an adult sized shirt. Way too big for my daughter. Very cute shirt though.
2.0,"I was hoping this bracelet would be really nice, but unfortunately it isn't. The elastic is very tight. It holds tightly to your wrist. There is literally no room for it to wiggle on your wrist and there is no jangle for the strands of beads to make. The gold disks stick straight out and don't rest flat amongst the other beads so it looks silly. The beads look very inexpensive. If this was made and given to me by my grandchild, I would love it, but it isn't."
2.0,It's nice quality but I'm a bit disappointed as the badge is misplaced on it. Not in the same place as the picture. Thought it was defective so I returned the first purchase and ordered a second when they became available again. The whole process took 2 weeks. Second is the same issue as the first.
2.0,Came damaged! The ID holder was WRINKLED AND IN Creases like it was folded during transport!!
2.0,Not what I expected.  It is cheap construction with &#34;cardboard&#34; sides.
2.0,The pieces broke it was made cheeply and the colord balls brake so easy i have tk keep a spare where ever i go
2.0,"I was so disappointed with this dress. This first one I thought, oh, it's way too small. Then I tried the next size up, and still, it looked horrible. I sent both back. The fabric is thicker than expected, but it still felt cheap and scratchy."
2.0,Upper too tight
2.0,This reminds me of a bathing suit coverup. To say it‚Äôs light and thin is an understatement. Also I cannot imagine this not snagging up like mad. Returning.
2.0,The material is not comfortable
2.0,"The color prints are very nice but the mask had no shape or contours to the face. Most have contours for your chin and nose. Theses don't, it is a piece of fabric that you have to adjust and stretch to get it to fit. It is not comfortable at all. I have no plans to use them."
2.0,"Cheap fabric, almost see through. It is a stitched wrap dress with a useless belt."
2.0,"They're very cute but all but 3 were way too big for my neck even when it was the tightest I could make it. Hung down awkwardly. And I'm not a small person, lol"
2.0,"Doesn't wrap around your neck, it's a bit to a mask."
2.0,These seemed to fit small on me. One of the lenses fell out after a few days.
2.0,"Top was true to size, bottoms were extremely small for a large"
2.0,"It came without the belt, and I didn't notice soon enough to return it. I went by the size chart and it was too baggy. If I had bought a more form fitting size though, it would have been too short. But maybe a belt would have solved that issue. Either way, it worked for my pennywise Halloween costume."
2.0,This is made of a weird material and does not wear well. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I guess you get what you pay for. I've ordered another scarf from this company and was pleased  (other than the horrible wet dog smell).
2.0,"Nice material and cute on top, but the slit is right down the middle and is only attached at the waistline, meaning that when you walk the dress exposes EVERYTHING. This would only work with a same-colored slip underneath. Will be returning."
2.0,"I ordered an XL... the bottoms fit fine.<br />The top fits like a medium... 2 sizes smaller. I threw the shirt out, kept the bottoms."
2.0,"I wanted to love this dress and I went through all of the reviews to make sure I was picking the correct size - the green one that I ordered did not have elastic at the waist so it was sadly too small. But it was adorable. It's not available in the large so I'll have to return it.<br />I'm 5'1"", 145lbs and have a 29 inch waist."
2.0,"The print is cute, but the fabric is very cheap.  Not worth it."
2.0,I did not like the waist was to tight
2.0,"My son needed new water shoes and I saw these on Prime Day. The deal looked too good to pass up! They fit great to start and my son loved them. However, two weeks later the strap on one just broke off! It snapped so it couldn't be put back (even with hot glue attempts). This was such a shame because I bought them for their back strap (required at his daycare). Now I will be looking yet again for water shoes."
2.0,Not as cute as it looks in the picture. It's also an awkward size. I don't think I will ever use it for anything.
2.0,It's poorly made. the loop broke off after a couple wearings. Pretty though.
2.0,"Shoes are cute, but run small and are not well made. I was expecting them to give my daughter a little room to grow, but they will not last long. We ordered an 8, but they fit like a 7. My daughter tried them on and not two minutes later the mermaid fell off."
2.0,"I have a aligned shirt that  I bought several years ago.  It is a size medium and it is getting a bit tight.  I bough a large size and when it came, it was labeled large and is smaller than the medium I already have.  I think it was mislabeled.  I called Alignmed and they said the style had changed and the elastic in the fabric was not as stretchable.  I laid it beside the medium that I had and the large was much smaller then the medium.  I could hardly get it on.  according to the charts I am  just at the line  of a medium or large. I talked with them several times to no avail.  I was afraid to order the XL.<br />Who knows what I would have received.  I really need this type of shirt...but evidently , not from Alignmed. I did send them the picture of the med and the large."
2.0,I am very disappointed to say that I received a defective shoe. While one of the shoes works perfectly the other won't even turn on. i am returning these a reordering them in hopes of receiving a working product because I was very excited about these and they are quite cool. Hope they work this time...
2.0,"Everyone says stuff from China runs so tiny, but this dress was huge on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 115 lbs. ordered the small and it was so baggy it looked like a nightgown. The design was so pretty but even with a sewing machine I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to salvage it. Such a shame, I love the design! The dark green color was beautiful."
2.0,Smelled of wet and moldy leather.
2.0,"The thread started coming apart right out of the box, and it smelled really bad.  Sent it back."
2.0,Probably my fault but assumed the logo was a patch or embroidered but it‚Äôs just an iron on.
2.0,"I love the small Vera Bradley Mini purse, but need one that my Kindle will fit in.  The opening is 6&#34;,  but has metal edges so it is not flexible. Even though I can put my Kindle in, it will not turn and lay inside, so I can close the purse.  The purse is really cute, but<br />I am not going to keep it.  I love the new color and will purchase one just a little bigger in Cocoa Moss. So glad Amazon has the free return policy.<br />Thanks Amazon<br /><br />Iris in Florida"
2.0,"These are nice looking very light lanyards, but the elastic cord breaks within 2 months even though they are only used once a week and not washed and dried. Better to find something sturdier."
2.0,I ordered a Small because of all the reviews said that it was right to the size. You have to be super skinny to pull this dress of without being able to show what it is underneath the dress. I am 5'5'' and weigh 136lbs. Maybe a Medium would have fit better than the small one.
2.0,Did not come with a clasp to hook the watch together.... Have to return it
2.0,Got a different wallet in mail. Had to send it back.
2.0,Product was delivered quickly in condition promised. But it stopped working properly within about 1 month.  Never again
2.0,"I'm only giving it two stars because I ordered the pink set and received white. Other than that, it is cute."
2.0,The material is very stiff and it isn't as float as it looks in the picture. I wore it once and didn't like it.
2.0,already got rid of it - what a waste.
2.0,"These shoes look amazing in the picture. They are not as great in person. The materials are thin and they run pretty large, which makes them bunch up weirdly at the top. I wanted to love these so much!"
2.0,"Strange item. There is a 3ft long ""spaghetti "" strap only one very long intact string. I have no clue if I am suppose to cut it to make 2 tie-up strings or if I'm suppose to wrap it around my waist or neck... Totally confused. Definitely not what I wanted. I am going to give it to someone who can figure out what /how to wear it. Too late to send it back."
2.0,"Unfortunately, the watch pictured is not the one I purchased, but a newer version of the one I have. Mine is a black face w/no calendar.<br />I own approximately 30 timepieces and switch them around each day, so this item goes on my wrist every 30 days. Bought it maybe two years ago, can't find it in my previously Amazon buys. After about five wears I noticed the strap band dye started coming off, okay it's a inexpensive piece but after only the 5th wearings, c'mon?<br />So I used brown shoe polish to touch it up,not a big deal. Then after several more times I noticed that when i moved my hand something sparkly moved inside the face of the watch.What? Upon closer inspection I realized it was the silver hour marks that had come loose and three of them dance around the face when I move my hand, charming.<br />Lastly, just tap the backside of the watch, (was it good for you?) and you'll hear a most tinny hollow sound. The sad part is that I really like the design of this product and still wear it. Telling time is no problem I have several Movados. So now that I've vented all that I will add is to say, ""buyer be advised"". Manny Villarrubia"
2.0,"The dress looks like it came from a used store. Material very thin and it looks very cheap,  which at 12.99, I  guess it is.<br />This is a dress more suited for home work.<br />I wouldn't  purchase again  nor recommend"
2.0,It broke within a week of wearing it.... it looks great though....
2.0,I cannot believe someone would sell shorts with a raw edge hem and think that is acceptable. It is not. Don‚Äôt buy these.
2.0,"I was so disappointed because I love the design, but it just did not have the necessary support I needed. I had to return :("
2.0,"Jacket was fine, pants were WAY too small."
2.0,The string was held together with glue and broke.  I put it on Paracord and when I showed everyone they asked why I bought a burnt pepper necklace.  Looks almost nothing like the picture.  If I can figure out how to upload a picture I will.  Also I know my name is Karen but believe it or not this is the first negative review I've written.
2.0,[[VIDEOID:4b10e747332ecaaf55efa63e22b9cd0b]] Looks Okay but the straps were destroyed after one wash
2.0,"Larger then I believed, and different material, not awful but I returned it, to big. 5‚Äô5 curvy, 140lbs ordered a medium. Probably needed XS"
2.0,Broke 1st time I wore it
2.0,"I had high hopes for this sleeve. It looks good, feels good but in the end it‚Äôs a failure."
2.0,Daughter wore this for about 2 weeks before it started turning GREEN!!!
2.0,"the fabric and warth was perfect, the design and fit was awful."
2.0,Item does not fit as described. Looks very little like what I purchased.
2.0,"When I opened the package it smelled of gasoline. Thought it might just be the packaging, but it wasn't, the product was even worse. Not sure if the product is made with something that just smells really bad, but it still smells even after was hung them."
2.0,item is cheaply made it was broken when i received it
2.0,"Nice skirt, but the fit was too small for size 16. Had to return."
2.0,"Theoretically it's a nice cut, but the fabric edges are cheaply cut and the arms are ridiculously long. Sad, because it looked nice on the model."
2.0,Cute outfit. Very short
2.0,"The background looks like it was supposed to be white, but be careful as it is gray. Shipping does take awhile."
2.0,Don't hesitate to order this ring! It's gorgeous!<br /><br />UPDATE: I've only had this ring 1 week and a stone fell out! It's pretty but not very well made. Big disappointment because I'll have to send back for replacement ring or a refund.
2.0,Does not fit well and sags in the wrong places.
2.0,Way to big for adult (at least for my face complexion which is average semi round) the elastic are good and the cartoon itself I love (I love anything with tweety bird on it) unfortunately am not able to wear it b/c of his size ... I will try to customize myself. But the material is good and very soft.
2.0,Hard to imagine a child being able to use this since as an adult I had a difficult time attaching the mask.  Going to try the lanyard with a plastic end.
2.0,Looks cool but is hand wash only. This is hard to do with a preteen boy
2.0,I love this towel but by the 5th wash there‚Äôs a hole in the top part of the hood. Super disappointing bc it‚Äôs really cute!
2.0,"This is cute and the fit is right, but, you cannot wear it out in public, because it shows your whole chest and bra. The neckline is so low it is obscene."
2.0,It's comfortable and easy to remove but the pink color wasn't bright more like a whitish color. The teal one was nice.
2.0,"This outfit didn‚Äôt work for me, it was way to short and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô7, the skits in the knees were all the way up by my thighs. And the draw string is a big thick rope, all in all cute on others but not on me.. The perils of online shopping i guess..üôÑ"
2.0,"They don't stay on ,backs are to big"
2.0,After 5 months the black  is wearing off the  band. I am not hard on watches nor particularly active. At 480 this is  not acceptable! Too late to return to Amazon. Fit and looks before it started wearing off were fine.
2.0,"The Good:  The magnifying area placement was perfect allowing ez reading looking down, and ez distant viewing looking straight.  In contrast, most bifocals have small magnifying area and/or placed too low forcing an awkward and uncomfortable sharp tilt of head up while looking sharply down w/eyes to read.<br />The Bad: These frames are very large and suited for someone with large to extra large head.<br />And the plastic frame material felt cheap/brittle - like it would easily break - however this is only an impression and my assumption and could be wrong.  Regardless, I returned them.<br />The Hunt is Still On:  Can someone help?  I am open to recommendations of bifocul glasses that are designed for functional everyday wear for someone who stays active with physical work, including the feature of staying in place.  Safety lenses are not necessary but ok.  What I'm trying to avoid are the traditional ""good looking"" bifoculs that are intended to be worn in the office and compliment your looks."
2.0,Low grade quality stones fell out quickly
2.0,wife review:'<br />the material wasn't great and it looked like it would stretch very quickly. it was already weird shapred. i was expected it to be a bit stiffer.
2.0,"I bought the dress just to have a lightweight easy piece to throw on during the hot summer months. Out of the package, it smelled like a plastics factory! It was made from a super stretchy poly cotton blend fabric. I tried it on and the style didn't look flattering at all. It was probably intended to be a flowy, breazy, twirling type of dress, with an option of being off the shoulder thanks to an elasticated neckline. But on me it looked like a loose, stretched out cloth bag with an elastic opening. The fabric didn't breathe as it was not 100% cotton, so it felt uncomfortable to wear on a hot day. The fabric didn't work with the way the dress was designed. That style needed flowy fabrics in order to work: chiffon, satin, etc! It wasn't working for me, so I returned the dress."
2.0,"The watch is beautiful and fit well even on my skinny wrists.  However, a couple hours after wearing it, I realized that the watch was ten minutes fast.  It's keeping time too quickly, and won't be a helpful watch so I'm returning it.  I may try another."
2.0,Two of them are starting to tarnish from wear already. They are pretty though.
2.0,"Although my son likes the way the watch looks, the set up instructions are horrible!  For the life of me, I cannot set the date!!!  I've been trying for an hour and have given up!"
2.0,"I was so happy with this strap at first. It was the most comfortable strap I‚Äôve ever had, plus it was crossbody, which I love! It was also easy to remove and put back on. However‚Ä¶ I was second shooting a wedding this weekend and it broke! I was carrying a mirrorless Canon R with a 50mm lens, so it wasn‚Äôt even as heavy as my 6D setup or someone who might be packing the 5D series.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are carrying more than a point and shoot, this is NOT the strap you want."
2.0,"Very thin, and very poor quality. Sent the item back, easy return policy."
2.0,"The picture and what I got are not the same gray color.  It says dark gray, but it is definitely a light to medium gray color.  It is a gift so I will give and let the return if they want, completely disappointed in the color."
2.0,this scarf is overpriced.cheap looking
2.0,It‚Äôs more like a PJ in my books
2.0,This looks nothing like the picture ! It's a cheap reyon material that looks see through and I'm 140 pounds 5'2 and this thing was huge. I would not buy this again.
2.0,I received two different size tapers
2.0,"Received 7/31/18 and strap broke 8/16/18. I haven't been carrying any heavy items or overfilling the bag, so was surprised it<br />snapped. Can't  repair, would have to replace strap. Opening is very narrow. Liked it, thought it would be durable, though smaller than expected. Disappointed."
2.0,The entire outfit arrived in a zip bag with a funk odor. It may be just the one I ordered but I am returning it. The outfit looked like the bottoms run small so you might want to order a size up. I ordered the large but the material is thick & doesn't look like much stretch. The outfit is great & looks just like the picture.
2.0,"Very low rise, I bend over and plumbers crack happens!"
2.0,It was really nice and my daughter loved it u til it broke on the third day of wearing it
2.0,Had to return because it fits weird around the to top in the back.
2.0,The previous reviews were correct when stating that you do not get the solid purple. Highly disappointed because I paid the little extra to get the solid ‚Äúdark‚Äù purple but got the lighter purple with white borders instead.
2.0,Product and material is beautiful but if you a woman with big boobs forget the dress!<br />German Dirndls are made for big boobs and I‚Äôm just so upset to wasted my money
2.0,"I was really excited when I bought this. Due to that excitement, I was extremely disappointed when it came in the mail. The color was really dull and looks old. This could have been overlooked but the lanyard is frayed on the edges and ripping apart. I also looked at the gold buckle which had scratches all over it right from the bag it was in. This lanyard was supposed to be brand new but there are deep scratches, its ripping and, it looks old. I paid $10.99 for this lanyard and it was a mistake. I honestly feel like I should have bought a different one from a different company. DO NOT BUY."
2.0,Had to send them back they were to tight in the toe box
2.0,they were 2 different colors couldn't even wear them
2.0,"Pay attention to the size.  This thing isn‚Äôt tight on my head and although I can easily wear sunglasses, the wind definitely hits the ears."
2.0,Bought this for a toddler 3t is what the item showed on the tag when I zoomed in on it. It came in it was size 12 way to big for from being a toddler size
2.0,"I love the hat, we ordered a medium and unfortunately it was WAY too small for my 7 year old son. We ended up giving it to a 4 year old and it was almost to small for him. We ended up buying another twister hat in an XL size and it fit my 7 year old perfectly."
2.0,"Cute necklace overall, however misleading  in the description states Nickel free but gave me a bad reaction where I wore it."
2.0,"I had a feeling that the fit would be iffy because these are legit denim jeans. That means they have no give/stretch with sizes small, medium and large. I ordered a medium at 5'5"" and 140lbs. They were snug in the wast meaning that I would size up however they were extremely tight in the bum area too (I dont really have a big bum lol). Where they were snug in the waist the crotch portion just did not sit where it should which made the jeans uncomfortable. I think it is a hit or a miss it just depends on your body"
2.0,"Well made, but WAY too large to use as cufflinks - they look chunky."
2.0,"Somewhat too small,  as  I tried to surprise my husband by washing them and putting them in his draw.  When he tried them on -  somewhat to tight.  I'm  stuck with them.  Will try again with a larger size.  Thought i was good , but -not."
2.0,"had to return because it was too small, but a good looking dress."
2.0,This hat fell apart after I packed it in my luggage to take in vacation. It's very delicate. Don't pack it!!
2.0,"Not for women with lots of cleavage.  I would show a picture but it's pressing my breast and I naturally wear a size large.  Definitely made for women with smaller breast or go up one or two sizes, but it will be extra losing around the waist.  The material reminds me of a shower curtain if that's the best way to explain it.  Definitely returning it"
2.0,"Okay, #1 thing to realize when purchasing these is to know the size. I don't think it's listed but I would guess 1.2mm. These are intended for lip piercings but I don't see that working very well. The bases are short, and very cheaply made. They crack and bend easy, will break if you mess with them too much. The jewels post is way too short. It barely fits into the bioplast base! On a lip piercing these would pop off all the time.<br /><br />These would work better on the nose, or even the tragus. I actually used them in my tragus and got a few compliments from people who liked the smaller size.<br /><br />Overall... Not good for the lip. Know the size and expect something cheaply made. Still a decent deal for the amount of studs (12). There are better deals out there."
2.0,"Didn‚Äôt like the material, kinda cheap."
2.0,The quality looks nothing like the picture.  Very thin material.
2.0,"I bought a couple of these shirts a few years back.  They WERE great.  Good fit and well made.  I just purchased a couple more and I‚Äôm disappointed.  They are extremely thin (almost half the weight of the shirts I bought a few years ago) and collar is just as thin a very flimsy.  I don‚Äôt know if it is the cause of the material thickness (thinness may be more accurate), but they are very prone to static cling.  Same materials the previous shirts, which I still have and wear.<br />Other than that, they fit well.  Just don‚Äôt like how thin they are, the floppy collar, or the static cling."
2.0,"Their ok, but don't expect more than what you pay for"
2.0,Very thin material cheaply made
2.0,Was very bulky. Cheap material. Very faded out.
2.0,Size is easy to small so if you prefer this get the 2xl
2.0,The material was super thin..almost like a beach cover up..i also thought it ran small..i needed the next size up and according to the chart that would make me a 41 bust which I am not..im 36.
2.0,This band looks nice and is easy to install but because there are magnets on both ends of the band it slips and pulls the band tighter. I had to stop using because it kept pulling so tight it hurt.
2.0,"They are so loose fitting that they don't stay on my feet when I walk. I basically bought them for a quick slip on shoe to go outside so for the price, it's worth it if you don't wear them for very long."
2.0,"It works great so far. It's definitely bright enough to spot a small black dog in a large yard at night - just what we were looking for.<br /><br />But be sure to check the size - it's just a little big for a small dog. We have ours on a miniature pincher and he's OK with it, but it would be better at 3/4 or 1/2 the size. And you'd better have a pretty big cat if you plan on putting it on them.<br /><br />Otherwise it seems very sturdy (with a strong clip) and has stood up to our rammy little spazz of a dog very well. I love the squeeze on/off switch. We'll see how it holds up long term, but so far it's a great little light.<br /><br />UPDATE: One day after posting the above review the first light (from a set of 3) began working intermittently (at best) after less than 2 weeks of use. I was hopeful because they appear sturdy enough, but it seems the internals can't handle a running/jumping dog. Knocking 2 stars off because it's a great idea that's apparently poorly executed. Will update again after using light #2 for a while."
2.0,There are no tabs to attach the elastic band.
2.0,Received it with spots where the hem wasn't sewn. Cheap made.
2.0,"I was expecting the pants to be mid-calf, but they were cut higher than that, so when you move, they ride up closer to your knees. The worst part though is that they are too thin to even wear under a dress that covers your bum. The material is too thin to look decent even around the leg/knee area. I'm not sure what I'll do with these."
2.0,"I ordered this tie for my husband, who works in the aviation field. I was disappointed that you can hardly make out the instruments on the tie. Really small."
2.0,"Fit fine in the bust but waist down awful, not a flattering fit at all.  I'm roughly a size 20-22 or 2-3X depending on how/who makes the garment.  This should have fit better."
2.0,I was not very happy with the piece as a whole. It looks nothing like the women in the picture. I felt like a stylish nun as my friend kept calling me. The skirt is great on its own but the shirt is awful and I can not picture wearing it.
2.0,2XL is more like a medium
2.0,"It‚Äôs really pretty, just doesn‚Äôt stay up on my face.  I think it needs a wire at the bridge of the nose in order to help it, as well as adjustable loops."
2.0,"pin was bent on arrival, was able to straighten to some degree - unclear how usable it may be. The pin is not replaceable and if damaged, the whole unit is throw-away - inexpensive, but I prefer things that are repairable."
2.0,design matches.<br />but is not as pictured with waist tie or loopholes for waist tie.<br />it is much more sheer than in the picture as well.
2.0,"Product came up under a &#34;kids&#34; glasses search, but these are definitely adult sized classes.  My 8 year old really wanted these but they were way too big for her face and ears."
2.0,"I ordered this shirt plus another in the same size. One fit well and the other was somewhat tight, but wearable.  One problem was that I did not receive the shirt that I ordered in the print shown, which was my favorite.  Instead I received two with basically the same print, but in different colors. Because they were relatively cheap and took a long time to come as they came from China (which I wasn't aware of when I ordered them), I kept them. As someone else mentioned in their review, the material is shiny and somewhat clingy, but for just wearing around casually, acceptable. One last comment:  Although outwardly presentable, these are cheaply made.  I had to cut the tab and button off the sleeves, because rather than staying folded nicely, they sagged and looked bad.  Plus the raw edges of the hems were not finished which is unusual."
2.0,Eh... It's too small. when I lift my arms up the shirt goes up and it stays up. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew but it's ok maybe I can adjust it and make a shirt for my daughter.
2.0,"little small, comes down in your shoe when wearing"
2.0,I pick  large size and it don't look like it was in the picture. so I am very upset.
2.0,"i bought these beads as a gift for my ten-year old niece.  i did not end up giving them to her.  the color of the three blue beads was awful!  the three purple beads however were stunning.  go figure.  for the price, it was not worth trouble of returning- really disappointed."
2.0,About a quarter of the package of ribbons was defective.
2.0,"It is not that great, please don't buy this"
2.0,Cute shirt but it looks really cheap. The lettering is low budget.
2.0,"I‚Äôm usually a large, so I sized up to an XL. Maybe I should‚Äôve gone another size up... these just do not fit me right. I kept this nonetheless because I didn‚Äôt feel like sending it back. It fits me okay, but the crotch part sits a little too far back. The butt cushioning isn‚Äôt very thick. The cushion does okay in my spin class, but the product is eh.<br /><br />Cute design, but mediocre as a product."
2.0,Ordered a 2x and it fit like a small. Very disappointed. Very pretty and gave it to my daughter to wear.
2.0,Pants not for tall girls I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 165 pounds pants are beyond high waters BUT I love the material I love the shirt and the over coat came just as picture super soft and comfy !!!
2.0,"My sister put it on for 10 minutes and it started to slip off somewhere in between... and she didn‚Äôt even sweat. There should be some consistency with the quality here. Some work just fine and some don‚Äôt even stay on, like mine."
2.0,I ordered a size 10 even though my shoe size is 9. Flip flops are way tooooo small.
2.0,They do not fit a standard high heel! If the heels are not very skinny forget them fitting! nice product though.
2.0,Only worn a couple times and the stitching came undone. Pretty disappointed here :(
2.0,"This dress came for my daughter's birthday.  first off the dress had deodorant stains on it, like it had been worn and returned and it was then sold to me.  the dress in the image looks like it comes a few inches above your knee.  the actual dress is much shorter.  it looks more like a top which you can wear over jeans or leggings.  the material also looks very different. the only thing that looked consistent was the style of the off the shoulder sleeve with the white lace and the color.  it got 2 stars because it came on time"
2.0,"Returning them. Pros: they‚Äôre soft, well priced and comfortable. Cons: there‚Äôs no compression and feel like there‚Äôs no spandex. Result is they‚Äôre horribly unflattering and unless you‚Äôre super toned, they show every dimple of cellulite.<br />Disappointing because it was a great price for the two pack and they‚Äôre very soft."
2.0,"I searched for WOMEN'S slippers, these SAY they are WOMEN'S slippers, but they are MEN'S slippers. It says so on the box, and the 9.5 size in MEN'S slippers is much larger than a 9.5 size in WOMEN'S slippers. If you go by the title of this product, it is incorrect. Great shoes, feel comfy but for a MAN not a WOMAN. Sadly disappointed."
2.0,I do not recommend these. After one day using them the sole started spliting. The build quality is terrible. There are much better options out there!
2.0,Very cute and comfy. But the white is completely see thru. Like can‚Äôt even wear it out. It will have to be a swimsuit cover up üòü
2.0,"Not 11 inches as listed, barely 8 inches. The fabric is nice though a little thin."
2.0,I was thrilled when these arrived as they actually fit up to my knee and over my caves without issues. Cute and a perfect size when they arrive but they shrink in the wash. Which kinda sucks for my muscular caves and the fact I‚Äôm tall.<br />They are a thinner material. Great for summer and early fall in norther climates.
2.0,Not true to size & had a defect in safety toe.
2.0,"First - my bad - I thought these were OOFOS. Boy, are they not!!!  Size 9 is more like an 11 which put arch in wrong spot.  Material they're made from makes it almost impossible to wear a pair of flip flop socks with these.  Will stick with OOFOS."
2.0,"I'm a mailman and I wore them in the northwest. I ordered them dec 14th and am now sending them back, Jan 18th. In less than a month's time the sole split from the fabric creating a hole where snow could enter. Other than the quality, everything else was good, shipping, return, etc."
2.0,"First, when ordering, go one size down for the best fit. The good, if you have a mid to high arch, this is for you. If you have virtually no arch or flat feet, this isn‚Äôt for you. I bought these for the orthotic as my left foot suffers from a fallen arch and over pronation. The arch is too high. Pushing my foot to the outside making it unnatural to walk. Can‚Äôt wear them"
2.0,it wasn't what the picture showed it to be. returned it for a refund.
2.0,The toe area is very bulky.
2.0,My last review was not accepted. As previously stated. Product did not last long. Cane is not strong at all. I would not order again.
2.0,Does not look the same
2.0,"I actually saw a friend with this top in black and I thought it was beautiful.  When she told me she bought it on Amazon, I looked it up and decided to order it in wine at the size I normally wear.  The wine color was really pretty, but the camo print was not adjusted to match the wine color, so it looked really odd.  Then the size was REALLY small.  So it will be returned for a larger size in black.<br /><br />Update:  So a larger size is not available, and by the way do not send email to the address on the little flyer in the package!  They want your paypal account to send you a refund!?  VERY shady!<br /><br />Update:  After my review, they contacted me and said they would process my refund through Amazon, which they did."
2.0,"My husband sweetly bought this for me hoping I could do the 1 shoulder look. I can barely get my head through the neck hole much less try to even get it to my shoulder. The person who models this must've only been a foot wide from shoulder to shoulder! It also doesn't even come past my waist. The xl said it would fit me with room to spare and I did all my measurements before he bought it for me. The only thing I liked about it was the feel of the soft material.<br />My advice, order at least 3 sizes up from what you actually wear...unless you have boobs bigger than a B and a natural sized waist. Then all bets are off and you should look elsewhere for a sweater."
2.0,"cheap looking, clasp did not stay closed till i had to tighten it. not much of a selection for this type of fitbit only reason i did not return."
2.0,"Cheap material, looks cheap.  I won't wear it."
2.0,"The watch came with what seems to be a dead battery. I don't want to try replacing since there might be something else wrong.<br />I submitted a message and got no reply from Lige. I should mention that the instruction booklet includes 9 Models of these watches,.....none of which matches mine....most notably, mine has no calendar.. I like the watch,so, what do you propose to do??...I hope you reply this time ! (doesn't say much for your quality control) The watch arrived with the stem pushed in, which is normally the running position.<br />Leonard Balog"
2.0,this shoe fits nice my son loves it but after only 2 months one shoe is no longer taking the charge. that is rediculous. i bought another shoe like this for my other son and having same issue.
2.0,It is the real color but it's just 20 bucks instead of 6:50.
2.0,Worn for pictures and it completely fell apart when taken off üòë
2.0,These don't work well. I can get the index fingers to work some but not very well and forget texting with your thumbs. The material fits too loose so it doesn't work well.
2.0,"I do not recommend this product. Though it was beautiful and fit perfectly, the product arrived with a broken zipper. The zipper did not close the teeth, and it would also zip the fabric because of its poor design."
2.0,"Collar didn't hold it's shape from the beginning, shirt way too thin, not worth the price."
2.0,They are already starting to pull threads on a couple of the fingers. The touch screen fingers do not work on my iphone. They are too small for my hands even with the large size.<br />Went with a different brand.
2.0,"Does not fit up over the knee; don‚Äôt buy if you have wide or larger calves.  The socks are comfortable and cozy, but they don‚Äôt fit over the knee."
2.0,"I honestly liked the quality of this product. It looks like real gold and elegant look however, the size is way bigger than posted on the picture. I thought it is like a small hoop earrings just like as it is shown on the pictures. Not the right product if you r looking for a small hoop earring especially for the cartilage piercing. Returned right away!!"
2.0,"They look good, but be aware that they are heavy, and they are stiff. Walking in these I felt like I was wearing wooden clogs. They are not comfortable at all. Also, they are very warm. Not useful unless you live in a cold climate."
2.0,"I bought this because the side pockets in some of the golf pants I have are very shallow while others are so deep that it is hard to find one's tees.  This product holds two golf balls reasonably well, but there are no pockets for tees so I lost about six tees this morning playing nine holes because they kept slipping through the bottom."
2.0,"Cheap material and too small, I would not recommend purchasing."
2.0,Way too small and won't stay down.  Keeps creeping up my hips.  Bad purchase.
2.0,"They would work very well on a very small brooch, my brooch was about an inch long so they didn't work, just need larger ones."
2.0,"Beautiful stitching, but it bunches on one side and so doesn‚Äôt sit well on my head. I‚Äôll keep it to save the hassle of returning it, but I won‚Äôt be purchasing others as I‚Äôd originally planned. Too bad for me because it really is very pretty. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt give it more stars."
2.0,Decal peeled after one wash
2.0,The dress is cute and fits as expected but the material is paper thin and see through.  You definitely have to wear a slip under it.  I bought the green color.  I am also afraid to wash it because the material seems so thin I don‚Äôt think it will hold up.
2.0,"I was super excited about this outfit since it's sooo cute but it didn't fit! I was so disappointed because I bought an extra large but there was too much booty in the back sooo.....yeah. The top was okay (a little loose even) but the bottom couldn't handle my bottom lol. The underneath material is like paper thin and it smelled super funny. Long story short, I'm sticking to brands I know."
2.0,"These look great and genuine, but broke within 3 weeks of having them by only putting them on and taking them off."
2.0,"I have 4 different colors. I had re-ordered the blue after the knob on the pin broke within a couple of months of wearing it.  I was hoping it was a fluke...But it is definitely a design flaw as now the second blue one I have broke in less than 2 months, and the black is broken now as well.  They fit and feel wonderful, but not worth the price for only a few wears.  I change mine out to match my outfit...so unless you put it on and leave it on permanently, you need to order 6 of each color to get through the year.  You get what you pay for....lesson learned."
2.0,"What a piece of junk! Seams are crooked, sizing is WAAAAAAAY off and it is shorter than listed. The black fabric is literally see-through. I have ordered similar styles from other companies cheaper, with much higher quality."
2.0,Nice fabric. I'm small...so yes...it runs small. Problem is ...extremely shaped from just below the hips. You have to have very curvy thighs. I'm slim. I STARVE to be like this. It makes me look fat!!!!
2.0,The boot part of the earring is very THICK so it doesn't fit flush to the ear and kind of &#34;hangs&#34; off ear.  Wanted to love. Maybe ok for adult but not a childs.
2.0,The battery dies out too fast.
2.0,I even ordered a size up like it suggested & the hips were still tight. Fortunately I can sew so I let it out about an inch. I took it in in the waist & up at the shoulders. I had 1 day to fix it because the shipment was late. The zipper didn't work well. I had to change at the hotel for a Gala & it took me & 2 others trying to zip it up about 8 minutes... it was pretty embarrassing standing in the bathroom having strangers zip up my dress.
2.0,"No est√°n malos pero tampoco a buenos, la tela es un poco delgada! Como siempre nada es lo que parece en fotos!"
2.0,"I didn't like it and the sleeves get worn out after a few wash. I don't recommend it, it gets really tight and it sticks to your skin which makes it worst."
2.0,The material was to shiny..
2.0,Not that breathable
2.0,"Very hard to get placement right. Sticks well, but if you have to adjust, it‚Äôs difficult to get it to stick again."
2.0,"Perhaps I should have ordered the S instead of XS.  However, XS is long and I suppose the S is going to really drag on the floor.  Thought the style would've been more A-line, but it is really straight."
2.0,The shirt was very tight around my arms and did not bend well. The colors of the lace sleeves were a darker shade than the body piece. I would have liked them the same color.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this dress but I hated how I looked in it. However, it was VERY comfortable and if it weren't for my own opinion of how I looked in it, I would recommend this dress because it felt like wearing pajamas. I just didn't like how it enhanced my &#34;plus&#34; size. I purchased it in a size 18."
2.0,"Washed once in cold water on gentle cycle and hung to dry. Still shrunk significantly, to the point it is basically now a long shirt (lost about 5-6&#34; in length), and is no longer sheer looking as it was when purchased. Cute when I first got it, but changed the look significantly with one washing. Very disappointing."
2.0,I am finding that the hats that I buy have a onetime fit.
2.0,Would fit a 5 year old.....
2.0,Got a xl in Japanese sized which is about a medium in US and jacket fit great but shorts had no sizing and could not get them on...i wear a 6 in US so i think they sent smaller size in shorts...but i love the jacket
2.0,"The material was incredibly cheap and flimsy. The bottom hem of the shirt makes it look even cheaper. The size fit as expected and the color is nice. For the piece, it‚Äôll do for a one-time wear on vacation. I wouldn‚Äôt waste the money though."
2.0,"The look is as expected with the item, however, I noticed the gold item turned quickly as I was sweating and in the sun the first (and only) time I wore it.  It left a green ring around my neck and a strong metallic smell."
2.0,The shoes are very pretty however the leather is very hard.  They are not confortable to walk like other flats shoes.  If you want just to show pretty shoes that are flats then this is a good choice.
2.0,. Way too big. I bought a medium and I'm 5 months pregnant still too big for an oversized shirt. Its soft on the inside and seems made well but I dont like the material and it has poor shape when on. Wouldn't buy again
2.0,"I looked a long time to find these items in patters my family wanted. When they arrived, not one of the ones pictured were in the batch I received, even some that were definitely patters we did NOT want. Very disappointed because it did not say the patterns varied from the photo. Otherwise, the item itself does what it is intended to do...it holds your chapstick."
2.0,"Yes it‚Äôs a nice hat, yes it fits my kids head like it should but it‚Äôs not what I ordered. If you look at the description picture it‚Äôs a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù trucker hat with the white mesh on the back; the one I received has navy blue mesh. It‚Äôs just not what I ordered."
2.0,"The body of the blouse fits great, it's the arms that are snug, therefore, not very comfortable."
2.0,"Gave it 2 stars because it's beautiful. ONLY gave it 2 stars because the sizing is insanely off!  Based on the size chart in the desription, I ordered the XXL. (XX-Large: Shoulder: 16.1 inch, Waist: 43.3 inch, Sleeve: 17.7 inch, Bust: 44.0 inch).  I have a 41&#34; bust, which means I SHOULD have had some wiggle room. Nope. I know many found the size to not be true, but I wanted to try because sometimes it works out for me. Not this time. So bummed because it really is beautiful."
2.0,This item is not true to color. I looked at this item on three different device screens to make sure and the item is so much lighter than the photo.
2.0,It's not as red as  I thought it was. Look pinkish .
2.0,I like the charm but they are not ideal for Pandora bracelets
2.0,"The necklace is very nice, however the price is too high for what it offers, I think a right value will be $15.00"
2.0,The earrings I received were not as pictured.  The picture shows the earrings to be flat.  The earrings I received were ball shaped.  The pictures also showed it came with a jewelry pouch.  What I received was a &#34;bracelet&#34; box.  The earrings look to be OK but not what was pictured or wanted.
2.0,"Beautiful design and pattern, but that is about all that I liked about this dress.  Material is cheap and thin, shows off every unwanted curve.  The size runs super small, even thought I ordered a larger size based on the other reviews."
2.0,"It wasn't expensive, it works OK, but at the end of the day, it's a cheap watch. The dial is not very legible, the contrast is too low."
2.0,"Very disappointed that the material is not as listed. It states 90% polyester but mine is 95% rayon. Very disappointed that I have to send it back but I never ordered a rayon dress. Other than that, fit great and color great just too thin material. Should never send out something other than what customer ordered and due to misleading information I will not trust to order from this company again."
2.0,I had previously ordered one for myself and really liked it so I ordered another one as a Christmas gift.  Ordered 3x but hoodie fit like large.  The material was not at all like the previously ordered hoodie nor did it have any tags on it.  The 3rd party refused to provide free return as advertised on Amazon. Finally Amazon said keep the hoodie and they credited my account for the purchase.  Gave this item a 2 star only because Amazon gave credit for the item.
2.0,Were good as a normal glove. But I sent to borrow Alaska it can get down to-60 degrees. Even in -30 degrees  my father's hands froze with the gloves on even with a glove insert added. More practical for 30 degree weather not anything in the negative temperatures.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this. I like a nice henley but this shirt is a very weird material. It is like stretchy and thin swimsuit material. Because of this, it droops and hangs in the worst of places and makes it look like you have excess skin and folds. The coloring is not bad and the stitching seems fine. Overall I would only wear this as an at home/pajama type shirt."
2.0,"I had to return it, sadly."
2.0,The ring fell apart in less than 2 weeks:( The actual Hamsa fell off the ring and the part to connect it.......well can't be found.
2.0,I wear a large (size 10) and the medium/large is too tight. I gave it 2 stars only because if it was just a little bigger they'd probably be great.
2.0,XXL is not a size 14 as listed. It is maybe a 10.
2.0,These glasses are way too big and clunky. The fit is awkward too.
2.0,Shoulder area very restricting.
2.0,One pocket was a hole through and through....
2.0,"Two of the three leggings has mini holes all around the stitching. This is how they came, I didn't even put them on to find out how much the holes would stretch.<br />On the plus they are so soft and I really wish I could keep them!"
2.0,"shirt material is nice, but it's too small for my 3 yr old even though i ordered a 4T, and the shorts seem to fit fine but material is cheap, don't think they're going to survive after 2-3 washes."
2.0,Product was cut too small.  Similar purchased dresses  are fuller does not cling
2.0,"I normally don't like shopping in women's because everything is designed for a flat stomach, even in Plus Size clothing. (I consider XL Plus Size.) I was hesitant to order because usually women's clothing is cut to be form fitting and I prefer a looser fit. But, I didn't want to order from the Men's because I thought it might be too big. Putting this on, I felt like I bought it a size too small. Maybe it is just my aversion to wearing tight clothing, but I can't wear the jacket zipped as I feel like I am bound. TLDR: this feels too tight and feels like I ordered a size too small."
2.0,"I got a pair of these and liked them so much that I got a second pair.  For the money, I guess they're pretty good depending on what you're buying them for.  They're comfortable and feel very solid.  However, after only a couple of months the butt ripped open on one of the pairs while I was climbing over a downed log.  Given that it was not a seam that ripped, it seems to just be a structural defect in the pants.<br /><br />As long as you avoid any activities that test the structural integrity of the pants, they're excellent.  But I'd be wary if you're intending to engage in anything that requires squatting, or any hiking that requires any climbing."
2.0,"I returned it the moment I got it. Although they advertise that it's for toddlers (the frames may be toddler size) it's more fitted for an adult. The moment you try them on your child you realize that the things that goes around the ears are WAY too big or loose. They look nice and I was really excited when I received it but sadly they are no good. I am hoping that they will accept then defected return that I did or else they are going to deduct $4 from my return, which I find ridiculous since it's obviously something that they made crappy."
2.0,The only reason I ordered this was because of the Rasta one and the ones next to it. I like the colors but I really wanted the Rasta one and it didn't come with the package :(
2.0,Very cheaply made. Weird fit.
2.0,The skirt was a muter pink then shown in the picture. It was a very heavy material and it hung too low when on. It is nice quality but looks slightly different than the picture.
2.0,"They are not what I was expecting.  I have purchased many ""antique silver"" charms and these are dull and flat look like stainless steel.  Have black pits. Just not the quality I was hoping for."
2.0,SHORT! Don‚Äôt bend overüòÜ
2.0,Very small and flimsy.  Certainly not worth the money.
2.0,"I bought the shoe at my normal size, it was too large. I got it for 1/2 size small and it still slips on the heel. I tried walking around in it a bit to see if it was negligible enough. It got dirty and deteriorated immediately, the sole is soft & porous, being easily chewed up by concrete & staining easily. After wearing it for a walk it was too dirty to return, I have worn it 3 times and there are several places that look like they are severely deteriorating, like the bottom of the shoe just rubs off if scuffed against concrete.<br />The cushioning with the inserts was noticeable, it felt like I was wearing platform shoes. I can't say how comfortable it is in the long term (I got them hoping it would help some with my back issues by providing better support). Guessing for a true orthopedic shoe you gotta drop more money, but I sure wish I had that 70$ back from this purchase."
2.0,"I think it‚Äôs a pretty dress and it fit great but the material is so incredibly cheap. I ended up giving this dress away after wearing it once. I didn‚Äôt like it, the material wasn‚Äôt the best."
2.0,they look real bad on me...
2.0,"The reviews seem unrelated to these glasses. Lenses are small, the vision in blurry in them, and I can not wear them for long before getting tired."
2.0,It literally broke not even a day into wearing it. It was cute and comfy but I was disappointed
2.0,Very tiny and unimpressive
2.0,I ordered a 3X because I figured it would fit considering I usually wear a XL and it was way too small. I am very disappointed because this was to wear to my daughter's baby shower & now I have nothing to wear ü•∫
2.0,Thinness is nice but it only fits 3 cards really. Tried to put a 4th card in and it ripped the seam
2.0,See through.  Hole after 1 wear. Not good quality. Comfortable though.
2.0,Nothing of what I expected it to be in person. The return was easy and was the only food part. The bag is massive and not shown to scale. It is way too large for a purse. Unless u like large purses and the color is not correct the white is not stark white and is not pale or ivory it‚Äôs almost grey. I was disappointed.
2.0,"I ordered a Small, it is way to loose on me. I have to take it in for adjustment, the fabric i really liked and of course the print."
2.0,Cute but you can't even get this thing in your ear because the cross is poorly placed & in the way.
2.0,"Only part is metal, mostly is plastic.  The lack of instructions meant I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it to some semblance of working order.  There's no bottle opener unless the notched middle area not shown in the picture counts (found on underside).  It'll do the job, but it does not ultimately perform as I was expecting, and isn't as solid as I anticipated.  Also, given how it's laid out, I can fully see this as still allowing one's phone to get scratched.  I keep my phone separated from my keys, but if you're planning to get this and thinking of putting keys and phone in the same pocket, don't."
2.0,I bought the dress for my high school homecoming dance. Was super disappointed to find out it was incredibly large on me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 about 170 lbs and usually and XL but was sad to find out that the dress was too big.
2.0,I got a 3 pack & one of them has already broken.
2.0,Fell apart in a  few months. Cheap.
2.0,The lettering is sooooooooo very small.  You almost need a magnifying glass to see it.  There was plenty of blank space left (2/3rds of it!) that could have been used to make the letters legible for a person to read it.  It most definitely didn't live up to my expectations for engraving.  The calendar side (which marks an important date for me) is okay so I'll keep it (as a put away keepsake only).
2.0,Not worth it. If you want a watch to tell the time - not sure why else you would want one - don't buy this. It is totally unreliable. The little strap holders are really cheaply and poorly made and break quickly. Disappointed.
2.0,Hurts the kids ankles
2.0,Love the graphics but the material is very silky so doesn‚Äôt fit to my face. The mask sort of hangs on your face. Would have been nice if it had more structure to it.  Not sure it fits my needs as far as Covid protection.
2.0,Crappy material. Horrible sew job.
2.0,Bad printing jobüò© really sucks...
2.0,"Way too big, if they had been smaller I would have enjoyed wearing. At this size they look clownish"
2.0,"This dress is nice, but it's definitely a tight fit. If you have a big bust size, it's a snug fit in that area. Overall it is nice, just wish the bust was more flexible. I bought the XL hoping to have more room, but it's a very snug fit."
2.0,This appears like a sweatshirt in the picture  and states sweatshirt on the description. It is more of a long sleeve T-shirt. I was wanting something warm so I returned it. If you want a light weight long sleeve shirt then you may like it.
2.0,These don't really stick all that well. Can't use them.
2.0,It is too thin and yet very wide for a male.  Very disappointed.
2.0,These are cute and a light material but I ordered a Large and they were huge and short. So I returned.
2.0,"The product itself is awesome, but the spikes make it lame. From the picture they look like theyre metal, but they arent. This product is good to hang on the wall but lame for anything else such as cosplay"
2.0,"They are very soft, as expected, but there were a couple of tears in the crotch area.  Returning them is a little too much trouble, so they will probably sit in a drawer.  It's sad, because this could be a really good product."
2.0,one of the straps have problems with the thread
2.0,By day 2 the sweatshirt had little balls all over front and arms
2.0,Not impressed unique styles has a better fit actually are slimming and better quality
2.0,Material what stiff didnt lay right
2.0,"This blouse is both too large and too small at the same time. Also the cut is unflattering for heavier women. I ordered the 1X size because it is made of stretchy material and sizing is always a guess when ordering online.<br /><br />I take a large to 1X depending on the cut. However, this is designed poorly for those who are shapely. First of all, the shoulder area is huge. It is actually falling off my shoulders. However, the stomach area and where it is gathered in front fits but it is a snug and form fitting fit that makes me look like I am pregnant. It is just horrible.<br /><br />The only thing I like on this blouse is the 3/4 flare sleeves. Other than this, this blouse is not for me and does not fit right nor have a flattering profile due to the form-fitting waist and absolutely huge falling-off-the-shoulders neckline."
2.0,The color is very pretty but they are very tight in the toe area. The shoe is not deep enough. I ordered a 1/2 size bigger after reading the reviews but the shoe was still uncomfortable.I am stretching them out with rolled up socks before I wear them. The price can not be beat.
2.0,"Loved it because it's so pretty, but it got caught on all my clothing and it broke within the first week where it is not fixable."
2.0,Fast shipping but I wore it once and one of the rhinestone fell. Not good quality.
2.0,"Seam on the wrist started to unravel the first time I wore it, but otherwise warm, and fit well."
2.0,Very cheap construction. Looks like an apron. Too bad. It's a pretty flower pattern.
2.0,Fits as expected but the sleeves are super awkward. Shirt does NOT have pockets it is just sewn weird so you can put your hand there. You could absolutely not put anything in the &#34;pocket&#34; your hands will hardly even fit. Decent price but I'm planning on giving the shirt away because it is not what I expected.
2.0,"Pretty, but plastic."
2.0,super weird fabric.<br />if you have a B cup or larger material will stretch.<br />super loose under boobs so don't expect to have a shape.<br />not worth $20.
2.0,An odd fit
2.0,Great socks...for someone with really small feet.
2.0,"It's larger than I expected, and on top of it the plastic boning is very cheap and snapped easily when it was laced up. The busk also came twisted and I had to bend it back to shape just to get it on. Overall not the worst buy, since it is cute and otherwise feels well structured, but they use very cheap materials for the supports and they run a few sizes too big, in my experience."
2.0,"These appear to be a good compression sock, however, they are not long enough and cut off right at the top of my calf muscle and do not stretch to just below the knee.  Had to return because they were too short."
2.0,Much smaller than advertised. Returned with no intention of purchasing anything else from this line.
2.0,"My son loved the shirt and I loved how fast it was delivered, until I washed it, and it shrunk in the dryer. It shrunk vertically, so it cannot be worn anymore."
2.0,Length is great - floor length with room to spare and I am 5'6&#34;<br />Material is soft but this is much too thin and very see-through- even in black.<br />Probably could have sized up since it seems cut more like a Junior style. Overall not what I was looking for. Will return.
2.0,Fabric is cheap.
2.0,"These are comfortable panties but the sizing label is HUGE! I can‚Äôt wait to have sexy time with my husband and he‚Äôll have the opportunity to read my hip size from across the room! It‚Äôs like, would you like a side of panties with this label?"
2.0,"not what I  expected, cheap looking"
2.0,I ordered the gray camouflage leggings and was super excited because of how cute they looked. But the leggings are see through (super bummed). I'm curvy in the hips and recently had a baby so I had high expectations that these leggings would be good for working out and not see through. The material is super soft but thin. I would suggest ordering a size up then what you normally order and not working out in them as bending could be revealing. Aside from that they arrived on time and as expected.
2.0,"I should have known it was going to be too small, since there wasn't a size chart.  It is too small for the average adult.  I kept it and will use it in the dramatic play area for children."
2.0,Band is really large and I don't have small wrists. The watch was much larger than I expected and didn't have the delicate look I wanted. It also looked cheap.
2.0,"Way too small.  Well made and nice material.  But an XXL does NOT fit a 6'0&#34; 225 pound male.  In fact I would guess that their XXL would fit a 5'10&#34; 190 pound male.  The size is very small in the shoulders and the arms barely made it to my wrists.  I returned it since I could not move in it, could not drive in it and could not layer anything under it."
2.0,"I'm 6'1&#34; and the dress was WAY too long on me! After reading the reviews, I got excited because I can never find dresses long enough, but this was just ridiculously long and I didn't have time to hem it. I also returned it because it looked extremely cheap and poor quality (should have guessed from the price)."
2.0,"Be warned, if you order red, it's pink. Very soft, fits well but the only choice I had was red in the size I needed for my grandson but it's definitely NOT red. He doesn't seem to mind, he's only 4 so we'll keep it. I like the snap at the neck and the shark teeth are cute."
2.0,"I'm trying to find a fleece that allows maximal stretch for tennis, but is also warm and fitted. Tried several of them: Houdini Power, Moosejaw Gratiot, Marmot Olden, Mammut Aconcagua, and this one, Black Diamond Coefficient. Of all of them, this Black Diamond was the thinnest--almost like a stretchy, crinkly, paper-like material. I hated how it felt on my arms and it was definitely not warm enough. The one pro (and the reason for 2 stars rather than 1) is that it did stretch well and had imperceptible body lift or sleeve retraction when arms were raised. Still, it was by far the worst of the group and I returned it immediately.<br /><br />The rank order (best to worst) for the fleeces I tried was:<br />1. Houdini Power: the most fitted and warm<br />2. Mammut Aconcagua: a very close second behind Houdini (sleeves just a tad looser)<br />3. Moosejaw Gratiot: 1/3 the price of the others, boxy fit, but great value<br />4. Marmot Olden: boxy fit, silly styling with waist area ballooning out because of the horizontal seam a few inches from the bottom.<br />5. Black Diamond Coefficient: nope (reasons above)."
2.0,Overpriced. Quality of fabric is low and elastic is too short.
2.0,Run small and it really  sheer
2.0,"I'm 5'4"", 133 lbs., 34A bust, and I usually were a size small shirt. However, I sized up to a medium because the other reviews mentioned that these shirts run small. The sleeves are still too short on the medium. Additionally, the material isn't soft. Hopefully, I can get my money back."
2.0,This dress wa a cute but I felt like it fit small and didn‚Äôt work well.
2.0,"Wasn't very flattering for my  body type (5'2, 135lbs, large chest)."
2.0,Cheaply made! While trying fasten the chin strap it riped off the hat! The front flap thread just unraveled! So save the $14 on this one and find a better one like I'm going to do!
2.0,The color and design are cute that's about it. The fit is HORRIBLE. The material is HORRIBLE.
2.0,These darn things tarnished in two weeks.
2.0,The dress is poor quality and was already ripped and torn up by the time I received it
2.0,Definitely not what I expected I usually wear a med and this is definitely one size to big. Material is ok definitely not for the cold.
2.0,"Screen print very thick, heavy & stuff."
2.0,"I don't took a while to arrive, but this was expected and arrive before estimated delivery date. But, it is a poorly made rug the item looks ripped in one area. I love the rug but I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,The material is cheap looking and the stitching was not correct.
2.0,"For starters, my measurements are 40-33.5-39, 168 lbs, just shy of 5‚Äô6‚Äù.<br /><br />I wanted to love this bodysuit SO bad, but it was just such a miss for me. For starters, it was ridiculously tight. I have a number of everyday wear bodysuits like this that are right, but this felt suffocating (despite sizing up from my normal size of L, to XL to match the size chart). The bodysuit also accentuated every single roll, crease, etc., which was just not flattering. I bought this to wear with my work pants and a sweater, but I‚Äôm not even willing to hid under a sweater with this.<br /><br />Size aside, I take serious issue with the placement of the bottom button closure. Ladies, these buttons (which are bigger than buttons I have on other bodysuits, btw) hit right. at. your. V. Not towards the front like other bodysuits. It was supremely uncomfortable - I constantly felt like I was being probed by my doctor, or like a tampon was falling out or something. Even if the sizing was perfect and more flattering, I would return for this reason alone. Not worth having that feeling all day."
2.0,"stupid belt, need to undo to put on a pair of pants."
2.0,Beads are falling out and it has not even been worn yet.
2.0,The shirt texture is like basketball shorts and the red would be perfect for Christmas because I looked like a damn cherry bomb.
2.0,I like this outfit.  I ordered it in 2 colors and 2 colors are going back.  They say true to<br />Size.  What country?  What I received is not an XL.
2.0,Not the same material as the one I bought from the store.
2.0,"I absolutely hate these things, they broke the very first day they came. They were frail and cheap and ... well I guess I got what I paid for. Don‚Äôt buy these, I‚Äôm ordering another pair from another ad, and I garuntee they‚Äôll be better."
2.0,"Cheaply made, weird silk material. Extremely small."
2.0,Nice shirt however it is extremely thin and see through
2.0,One of the eyes fell off before it could even be worn.
2.0,"Large and clunky, not like what they are made to appear in photos. I returned these because they are not flattering to wear."
2.0,The material was very slick and made a weird noise when I walked. It fit pretty snug for me and the heart wasn't solid It kept changing colors in spots that were touched and looked kind of tacky. Cute design but maybe better for a child the adult.
2.0,My daughter was very disappointed because the Pom poms are not blue and yellow- they are blue and brown!  Does not represent University of Michigan school colors and does not match the M logo on the gloves!
2.0,"They feel like exactly what they are, cheap material poorly stitched together. I used them for one day of work and they didn't last the day... I was hoping these would be a cheaper alternative to my Mechanix gloves which have only recently started to show wear after years of use"
2.0,The bottoms of the bathing suit are cheaply made: the inner lining of the bottoms shows no matter what you do when you‚Äôre wearing them. The top is cute but the strings are a bit hard to figure out.
2.0,Bigger than expected - no form - too floppy!  üòü
2.0,"So much potential, but my usual size L was way too snug for my 38D chest. Not stretch at all."
2.0,The dress is super cute in theory but the top portion is not sized appropriately with the bottom.  It runs super small on the top but accurate in the bottom.  Perhaps you could try ordering a size up.
2.0,"This product is an extremely cute dress, I love it but it is SO see through. I know it might be because I ordered it in white but the fabric was not as anticipated, very thin."
2.0,"The photo for the necklace I ordered looks excellent, great contrast and beautiful color. The one I got looks like a lumpy turd by comparison."
2.0,These earrings are super cute - I would get complimented on them all the time BUT‚Ä¶<br /><br />It could be just me - everyone‚Äôs different but my right ear hole would always hurt when wearing them. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the type of metal used for the stud part of what but after 3 attempts at wearing them and having to take them off every time I have to toss them. :(
2.0,Very poor quality the brim is uneven and does not hold any type of form....
2.0,"Upon arrival, it was dented right where the clip that snaps it together side all the way across.  I attempted to push out the dents but stopped because I was afraid I'd make the clasp inoperable.  The packing was absurd, in a little box with absolutely no protection, but even at that, the case is flimsy.  No wonder it dented.  I suggest you buy a stronger product if you're going to depend on it not popping open or denting easily.  Fine for protected use, such as carry in a purse or bag, but I'm a rancher and need the &#34;can't bust this sucker with a tractor&#34; type.  I'll keep looking...  Oh yeah, it does hold all my cards inside (14) and still snaps together, which is why it got 2 stars instead of one."
2.0,Way to big. Colors were outstanding. Expecting much smaller. Worked out made brooch and necklace out of the earrings.
2.0,"It is super cute, but the skirt fell apart the first time it was worn. Since it was a birthday present and was bought early, it was past it's return date by the time she wore it or I would have asked for a refund."
2.0,The bracelet is too small .  I have a small wrist about 7 inches and this is more like a six.  I make jewelry and this is not for an adult maybe a young girl.
2.0,But Ive ordered a medium and im 163 and it was baggy. I want to order the small in the same color but Im waiting for it to be on Prime again.
2.0,"Ordered an XXL (and I‚Äôm generally true to a XXL). OMG, no. It was so short. The material is the same as a cheap Halloween costume. It‚Äôs also tight up top, so the thin material coupled with a tight fit‚Äîthat‚Äôs a no for the boob area. On the flip side, it‚Äôs cute. If you‚Äôre going to order, definitely order a size or two up. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not fit for big girls."
2.0,The watch looks really nice.  The dial to set the time keeps popping out so the watch stops.  A time piece that randomly stops is kind of useless.
2.0,Too long.  It looks more like a maternity top. Sorry
2.0,"This is my bad, I didn't read the sizes well.  I thought it was going to be a big tote bag I could use for the boys snack treats for sports or beach toys or something.  Its an adorable bag, I just didn't read the sizing well.  When it is zipped fully there is still an opening that stuff could fall out of potentially.  It is a cute bag still."
2.0,Kind of tight and rides up.
2.0,Swim suit well but after 2 swims all the glitter  scales came off. Very disappointed
2.0,This runs small. It was tight on my chest. It was also very short. Washed it once and the pants are now so short.
2.0,I like this dress but it is way too long even with 4 inch heels on. I arm 5'5 and it still drags the floor and is way too big in the arms.
2.0,Looked so cute so was disappointed that it was much too large.
2.0,cheap price and cheap quality.  It came on time but the quality is crap
2.0,runs extremely small.  ordered an XXL and it looks like a medium
2.0,I bought two of these and **both** of them have come unraveled at the leather tip.  Very annoying.
2.0,appropriate size that was ordered was still too small
2.0,The boots deserve  between  4 and  5 stars  but  the seller  deserves  -0 starts. Product seems to be of nice quality and these are very cute and really nice red color with shiny freckles in the bottom rubber part. To bad the people that are packing the merchandise could care less to look and see what they are sending out of their warehouse.
2.0,"Wore pants one time and stitching came apart in seat of pants creating a hole in them.  Be careful that you look over product upon arrival! Pants are cute, but useless to me now! What a waste of money! Super disappointed!"
2.0,"This shirt is very thin. I would not wear as a ""dressy"" blouse. Haven't figured out what to use it for. Any suggestions? Runs big."
2.0,"I ordered the recommended size for my toddler based on the size chart and this had a really awkward fit. The bottoms were bizarrely high waisted and the top was waaay too loose. There was no way it could be worn for any actual sun and fun play time. It‚Äôs a shame because it was so cute, but just doesn‚Äôt fit right at all."
2.0,Very thin! Bends easily! Concerned that they will break!
2.0,If u short don't buy
2.0,The material was just what I was looking for and also the style was what i wanted but the fit toooo small I‚Äôm so mad I wear 36 but I needed a size up 38 so I don‚Äôt even know can‚Äôt I get a 38??
2.0,The picture makes the bag look shiner and of better quality work. The bag is actually very flat and colors are much duller. I will see if the the gift recipient wants to return it or have me embellish it to make it look like the picture.
2.0,did not fit the large key fob I was purchasing it for
2.0,This does not do a very effective job on my silver jewelry.<br />I wouldn‚Äôt buy this again.
2.0,This is a really cute little bag but one of the metal decorative pieces fell off during first use and was lost so this is apparently a disposable item - not re-usable.  Two stars because it is cute and inexpensive.  Too bad it will just fill up our landfills.
2.0,"This is an excellent pair of pants, just that I order black, and this is grey..."
2.0,It's cute but wayyy smaller than I expected
2.0,Broke after the first use. Still able to use but one of the end pieces came off the prongs.
2.0,"It fits and is cute but the headband came apart one day out of the package, very disappointing since we had a few more days until Halloween so i had to rig it for my daughter to wear it.  That part was poorly put together"
2.0,"I bought this for comic con, I already have a nice Runa hoodie so I figured I can jus get a cheap uniform but I guess not. I ordered a medium based on reviews and the size chart, but when it came it wouldn't buttum close it was so small at the under shirt was eve smaller. I am 5'5 and 120lbs. I returned it and ordered an XL but the bottom button was broken and it was still soo small at the arms and shoulders so I can't move my arms outstretched. It wasnt fitted on the wasit, it is very baggy and when I tried pinning it the bottom opens too much cause it doesn't stretch. I think it would be fine for a single Halloween party but the buttons might break and it will be hard to move if you want it fitted, I am very disappointed and will be returning it once more."
2.0,Nice style but thin material
2.0,DOES  NOT FIT
2.0,"I am not very pleased with these shorts. They came very late to when they said they would arrive, they also have threads flairing and when they came they had a hole in the side of the pants"
2.0,Colors in person do not match colors online. Dark black and bright orange like Halloween. Would not have purchased and will probably return. Wanted the faded autumn colors like advertised.
2.0,"I really wanted to like these, but I can't even see myself testing these much.<br /><br />Biggest issues:<br /><br />1. The bridge sits to high on the nose, that 30% of my eyes are exposed at the bottom, and due to which, more exposed on the peripheral.<br /><br />2. The bridge digs into the nose bad, and starts to hurt within 30 mins of use. And it being non-adjustable, you can't do anything about it.<br /><br />Nice thing is that it comes with many lenses, but what am I gonna do with lenses, if I'm not gonna wear the glasses anyway.  Might actually just use these for short driving trips.<br /><br />3. User guide is in Chinese, and minimal photos.<br /><br />4. No way to contact any Customer Support - no phone #, no e-mail - nothing!<br /><br />Returning!"
2.0,"Unfortunately my bag large compartment zipper broke on my first trip.  Great design, but quality of zipper -- and the zipper pull tabs is lacking."
2.0,High quality thick leather strap with heavy stitching...  but the &#34;vintage brown&#34; had a purple tone rather than the brown/black as advertised in pics.  Returned it.
2.0,"Was packed and hat was mushed. However, was able to straighten out. ( not easy ) very pretty"
2.0,"Cute but pretty terrible. The fit is super strange, so they're getting returned really soon."
2.0,To open them enough to put on it loses its shape
2.0,Was see Thur!! Not as mentioned not worth the money!!
2.0,"Cheaply made, did not fit my face it was really tight.  I looked like a big bug with blue eyes."
2.0,"The top portion fits really weird. It looks like it should cover your chest, but it just kind of sits at the top of it. It's a very weird-looking and very uncomfortable fit. I don't think I'll be wearing it."
2.0,They don't seem to stay on his feet.
2.0,"If you're not a size zero, forget about this skirt. I'm a petit girl, normally fit a size 3-5, Tiny waste, this skirt barely goes around. It's cute. Materials great but unfortunately, gotta give it to my size 00 friend. Looks great on her!"
2.0,These are not anything near the quality purchased in a store. Clearly they are counterfeit
2.0,Sizing wasn't accurate to the chart
2.0,"Although these boots are cheap and they are awkwardly made, I love the color, which is the only reason why I kept them. The color is beautiful and vibrant, so I made them work with a cute outfit.<br />I was skeptical about buying them because the brand is unknown and I haven't had good experiences with these foreign based companies on Amazon, and they aren't expensive.<br />The packaging is horrible. The boots came in a badly damaged brown box, not a shoe box. This turned me off.<br />Overall, these are poorly made, but great to wear with a costume or if you have the nack for styling and making cheap stuff look good."
2.0,"It was way too small if you have a large chest. I ordered a much bigger size than needed and still too small. I missed the return window. Oh well, it was a gamble to begin with."
2.0,Fits tight and zipper will NOT stay up! Have to use a safety pin to hold it and the pin leaves a &#34;bump&#34; under my shirt.
2.0,"I loved the bracelet, but unfortunately it came apart within hours of putting in on."
2.0,The picture a description does not tell you that the writing is SO small that you cannot even read it.... VERY UPSET about this one
2.0,"Fits as expected for length, cheap plastic costume jewelry. The company sent it to me through Amazon with a cannot return clause apparently. Never used it since it looked so cheap. Guess I'll give it to my niece to play with."
2.0,The sleeves are ridiculously narrow. If you order one you need to go up two sizes. Their large fits like small.
2.0,I  Ordered 10 of these dresses I love them they're very comfortable but the two blue ones just never showed up I know they said what more do I why they gave me my money back on one but I ordered two and really I even<br />Got 7 with the v neck all  made buy Zanzea I saw there was a diccount  if you ordered more but I did one at a time
2.0,"I only like that it is small (smaller than u think) and cute, but my ears started hurting after 1 hour or usage. Also very easy to break or bend back of it. Pretty disappointed in these earrings. :("
2.0,"This shirt doesn't fit like the photo at all, I think it must be pinned behind the model to get that fit. I ordered a small and it was HUGE, hung like a dress on me. Even when I tied it in a knot on the side, the arm holes were enormous, I had to send it back. For reference I'm 5'3"" 102 lbs."
2.0,Huge stain on the leggings! Can i get this exchanged?
2.0,vey poor thin quality falling apart
2.0,"I love the pattern but i didn‚Äôt like the neck halter , I was expecting the string will be on the back but it is on your right arm side , the black color is very light seems like you wore many times and the color got off ."
2.0,"i dont like it there ulgy as sin,"
2.0,The gotcha frequently falls out of the band. It isn‚Äôt tight enough. I have to put a small rubber band around the gotcha to keep it in
2.0,"Too large for the size so I wasn't able to wear it. I would have ordered small rather than medium. I ordered medium base on the description that it was a mini dress and it wasn't. I just checked on the item and it says that ""their clothing sizing has been updated"". So glad they finally updated it so people won't order the wrong size."
2.0,Got these for my husband wasn't happy after a week wearing them the black started chipping off and the jewels fell out!!!
2.0,I just received my glasses and was disappointed to find that 1 pair has bi-focal lenses.  Why wasn't this in the description?  After I received them I see that this is mentioned in some of the reviews.  Not sure if I will keep them.
2.0,The hoodie is way too short
2.0,"Thin, flimsy, poor finishing - sanding etc. Pretty colors."
2.0,"Began to get dull after a while, and even appears to have a bit of oxidation along the design. Probably not quality material. I doubt that it's silver, but rather silver-plated (which should be specified)."
2.0,I didn‚Äôt get the print that it shows<br />I may return it<br />Not happy that I got something that wasn‚Äôt as described
2.0,"Apears to have some radio circuit or diode in it, or a hardware or programed inconsistency.  Time has changed by an hour with no buttons pushed."
2.0,This is multi color glitter. doesnt look as chic
2.0,It‚Äôs a cheaper version of the pictures. The accent openings are smaller than pictured. Obviously a knockoff. Disappointed. Will donate to Goodwill.
2.0,These are very small and do not fit a standard bra.
2.0,"We returned these as they were obviously used, skids on the shoe and residue left in one shoe."
2.0,"The product came with a small hole in it. I put it on, and it feels perfect, fits as it should. But there is a hole! I would like a new one. I can't wear this one outside at all due to the location of the hole!"
2.0,Overall they felt uncomfortable.
2.0,The pieces started falling off slowly and at the end of the month wearing it it tarnished I threw it away<br />üòï
2.0,These are not as  supportive as I thought. Sliding down on my first wearing. Not impressed.
2.0,Seems to be one size smaller than what is printed on the shoe tongue label. Very uncomfortable.
2.0,"Received it quickly. Is soft. But upon receiving I noticed that the logo/screen print on the front was splotchy and uneven. Additionally, while the body of it provides room generally speaking, the arms and top felt snug and constructing considering the size itself. As if the body width and the top part were made as two different size measurements. I would return or exchange but the policy sounds as though I‚Äôd actually lose money to do so."
2.0,This had more of a boxy shape and not fitted as suggested in the photo. I returned.
2.0,Seam broke open from inside lower leg after washing once
2.0,"I loved the belt, but when I recieved it I tried it on and it was way too small. If the band was bigger it would've been perfect. Beside that, the quality is decent."
2.0,"For reference: I'm 5'5"", 117 lbs, slim/ athletic build. I ordered a size small and the tag said size 4. They probably fit a bit tighter than a size 4 in Lululemon's align shorts/ leggings. But it lacked the compression in the right places. The waist band is really wide and doesn't dig in, which is nice. But there wasn't any compression from it. In fact, it rolled down on me whenever I bent over. No compression or lift in the butt. The cuffs of the shorts dug in a bit which is unusual for me bc I do NOT have thick legs by any stretch of the imagination. Also, welcome to camel toe city. I could get past the waist band rolling down and the digging in of the short cuffs, but I couldn't get past how high it rode up between my legs. Sadly the search continues for a decent yoga short."
2.0,Only one of the earrings works and it is just white in color and a steady light. The other pair works and they flash different colors. I didn‚Äôt get a choice in color or twinkle option when purchasing but the photos implied they all would flash in multi colors.
2.0,This bracket is very beautiful but way too fragile. It broke after wearing for a couple hours.
2.0,"The blue metal watch frame and band is way too glossy making it look cheesy, cheap and of below average quality.  It is not like those pictured on the site. The quality looks below average to me.  Not high end! I'm returning it!"
2.0,These glasses were too large for my face.  I returned them.  The did feel like they were made well.
2.0,This shirt has really long sleeves and a very wide neck but fits normal in bust and hips.
2.0,"It's been several months that I have used this mask and I actually liked it until a few days ago when first, my daughter was in pain when I put one mask on her. I thought she was faking it but a few days also, she actually removed a thin wire that seems to hold the nose area together. Another one of these things came out yesterday from the same batch of masks. Again, this is from the same bag of masks out of a bunch in a single order and this is for kids so a lot of caution and care should be done."
2.0,Missing the nose pieces but overall good for the price.  Disappointed it was missing them but needed them for this weekend so not going to return.  They are definitely decent glasses though
2.0,Cheap. And too think... Not meant for someone who wants to look slimmer
2.0,"This is a very basic, small mask. Doesn't even fit my older kids faces, but ear loops too long for the 7 year old. It's soft, like a T shirt, but the filter pocket only goes 3/4 of the way up, so the filter sticks out. No nose wire, so it's wide open on the sides of the nose since it's so small. Not very useful unless you are an anti-masker trying to just barely comply with rules and just want something for show that you will probably wind up wearing below your nose anyway."
2.0,"Doesn't look as fancy as it seemed online, but great for accessories  with tops and dres"
2.0,I liked the dress. When I walked though it would open up in the crotch. So I kept fidling with it all night.  I did however wear shorts under neath so I wasn't flashing everyone and I wore a sweater over it with my own chunky belt.  I'm 5 8 and thin. The length was perfect for me. It was a small and fit well around my chest and waste
2.0,hard time putting them on. sent it back.
2.0,I got it for work and working out. It lasted for about 2 weeks and started to turn white and get stretched out.
2.0,"These are ill fitting and of poor quality, though they do look nice.  I agree with some reviewers that they are not real Frye boots üë¢.  They had to go l!"
2.0,Good for the amount
2.0,"The measurements are not accurate. I ordered the largest size, and still, it was too small. The color is very beautiful."
2.0,I have worked out in this a couple of times now and I can say i do sweat A LOT which is a good thing. My biggest complaint is the zipper is cheaply made. it comes down during my workout and can pinch my skin. it has happened a few times. I spin twice a week and its so annoying to stop and adjust. I wish there was a clip to hold it together at the top. I will continue to use it for now but just beware of it catching in your skin win zipping up.
2.0,"The buckle is already getting scratches and dings after wearing it around the house for half a day. It's black, so it's shows the gouges in the cheap paint, too. If you buy it, baby it. This isn't a daily wear kind of quality."
2.0,"I wanted to love the dress but it looks like someone tried it on and it was to small for them, it's stretched out I am going to have to take it in to have it  altered. But once altered I am sure my rating will change to a more  positive one. Oh I order the large I am 5'6 about 145-150 36DD 331/2 waist 39 hips"
2.0,I really didn‚Äôt like it
2.0,This product looked exactly as it should have but sizing was way too small.
2.0,"2X is WAAAYY small. If they are going to say ""true to size"" they should include what region they are referring to because it's sure not American plus sizes.<br />Tanks are nice and soft, it's a bummer I can't currently fit into them"
2.0,Didn‚Äôt look or fit like the picture.
2.0,I‚Äôm re-reviewing this as ironically this company removed my review.  They did however keep my picture... :(.  I ordered two.  One came with a hole in the sleeve.  The second one the arms were 3 inches to short.  They kept my initial picture in the the green color and removed the picture where I showed the difference in the sizing between the black and green.  I will say the green one fit well other the hole but the black was made of a completely different material as well as completely different sizing.
2.0,I was thinking this would be more tee shirt material and it was silky and stretchy. Too tight for my 16/18 size in plus.
2.0,too large on my face----looked like a clown
2.0,No me gusto por qu√© no es igual al de la foto es diferente
2.0,They sleeve r too tight<br /> I love Colo i wish it fits
2.0,"We just received it today. I ordered one for my husband. Although it's a nice sweater, it was NOT like the picture. The one we received does not have buttons all the way down. Only around the neck. We both were disappointed bc the one on the picture is the one my husband wanted. We're now stuck with this one bc we need it for an event and he already brought pants to match. No time to replace. Nice sweater, just wished they sent what we saw"
2.0,Beautiful but it didnt work
2.0,"The dress was exactly as pictured, however, the fabric was very thin. I could see the outline of my bra through the top. returned it."
2.0,Wrong size but good quality and arrive within 2 days.
2.0,the top does not sit still and you will flash people
2.0,I like the design but the fabric is very light and cheap feeling.  Obviously this runs very small.  I wear size 10 and bought a large and it was too small.  Fits like a medium.
2.0,"I bought these for my new Costa Osearch glasses and they fit fine.  That's where the advantages stop.  The first time I tried to take the ear-piece holder off, they ripped in half.  The rubber pieces are really not made all that well and it showed.  I would definitely not buy them again.  Waste of money."
2.0,Way too big! I‚Äôm 23 weeks pregnant and even ordered my real pre-pregnancy size and it‚Äôs still too big. I gave it 2 stars though because it is a pretty dress. The lace is beautiful and it is not see through at all.  Definitely size down a size or two if you want to try this dress
2.0,The sweater is fuzzy...it starte shedding right out of the box.  Didn't do anything for me so back it goes.
2.0,"Based on the measurements, the dress was too big for me. I looked like I was wearing my bigger sisters hand me down and it didn't fit quite right. Cute, but sizing needs assistance."
2.0,"It was a very cute top, that‚Äôs why the two stars. I regretfully had to send back. I ordered a small but was two sizes to big, I looked like a clown. Nice to deal with, I got my money back.."
2.0,"gift for a 16 year old , he wanted it and it lasted about six weeks, not happy"
2.0,It fit very big. If you are a 2X go a size down
2.0,"I didn‚Äôt get the Nola pendant, it was replaced with something that is not New Orleans. Not happy about it"
2.0,Fabric good. Size way too small.
2.0,I am a size 8 so I ordered a size 10 and it barely fits as far as the bottoms are concerned. The top in the bottoms are not proportionate at all. I was highly disappointed because the material is absolutely beautiful when you get it in person.
2.0,Order a size up. I wear an x-large and the shirt was too tight even before washing
2.0,Beautiful top but very sheer and the breast size is for someone very tiny. Even with an extra large and I am not by any means a big girl.
2.0,You get what you pay for. Bought as a cheap stocking stuffer and broke within an hour of being put on. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because it is still cute and is fixable (until it breaks again an hour later and you have to fix it again...)
2.0,"I bought this as a present, the beanie is too small. This would work for a child or teen. I wouldn't suggest buying for an adult. Sound quality and packaging were perfect."
2.0,This hat is way to tall... It needs to be shortened by at least a 1/2 an inch or more...
2.0,"Loved the look but it runs really large and because it is stretchy material, it looked even bigger."
2.0,Keep falling down- too heavy to stay horizontal
2.0,"The material was not what I expected. I may not even wear it, it‚Äôs just okay."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:490550e235ac6a43d2c2362f62f12dce]] The stretchy cord is super thin the size is very long so if you have a small waist it will be too big -it‚Äôs about maybe a 36 to 40 inches. you probably can only wear it a few times before it breaks and beads will be everywhere but it‚Äôs cute and it will make better bracelet
2.0,"I bought these for my ear cartilage and tragus piercings, gems are very vibrant and all was in tact, look very nice and flexible plastic was comfortable. My complaint though is it's very difficult to put these in my ear and the tiny jewel post isn't enough to keep the gem in place. I've had them for 2 months and lost all but one already as it only takes a slight tug of my hair to pull them out. Might work better for Monroe or labret, but I don't recommend for ear piercings if you have hair long enough to reach them."
2.0,"They're paper thin, run small, and run above the ankles. Look cheap and surely will shrink with the first wash. Not at all like the picture, the flare kind of narrow. Don't buy them. I'm 5'6"" 160 lbs and ordered a large. Keep scrolling please. They're too small and above my ankles."
2.0,This purse already broke.  The handle broke off the purse.  Will not buy again.
2.0,The ZIPPER would not lock to keep it from slipping down
2.0,"Honestly not worth it. The clasp itself feels substantial and solid, but it's feels like it's a much higher quality than the rest of the band. The machining/finishing is inconsistent on the links, and the black coating is so fragile that it was flaking off before I even unwrapped the plastic covering it. It honestly doesn't even look like paint, almost like an ink that was brushed onto the metal unevenly, with drips and thin spots.<br /><br />Additionally, the adjustment is limited to the width of a full link (about 1/2&#34;) - the closure itself has no micro-adjustments, so there's a pretty solid chance that removing a link will make the watch to tight, and putting it back will make it to loose (as in my case).<br /><br />If I was ordering again, I'd skip the multi-tone versions and go just for solid metal. That alone would probably add another star and a half to the rating (given the price point). If there were some clasp-side adjustments, it'd be a whole different product."
2.0,The costume is cute but it is not adult size.  It is a child‚Äôs costume.  Disappointing.
2.0,"Hat does not look exactly as shown, very similar but the alliance emblem is like 50% smaller than the seller is showing.  The emblem also does not feel very securely sewed onto the product, easy enough fix with a thread and needle but for the price, I would have preferred something that doesn't feel like it can be easily ripped off. That is why I am not giving this product 5 stars. I did not buy it for a nice comfy black beanie, I liked the idea of wearing something that symbolized the alliance. The hat itself is comfortable and stays on my head just fine, nice material and quality, but not the best alliance product."
2.0,"Would like to write I LOVE this product - because it was exactly what I wanted and seemed well made ""until"" this afternoon when the snap closure broke - no way to fix it as a snap, snap tore right off. So sad."
2.0,It‚Äôs an ok dress but not worth the money. Very cheaply made and too big up top. I got a medium and it‚Äôs not fitting well. The top is too big and it‚Äôs too short so a small wouldn‚Äôt work.
2.0,"I love the way these earrings look, but the clips are  incredibly uncomfortable. They look like they're made for<br />pierced ears. At some point I'll change out the clip, but I don't recommend them if you're looking for a true clip on."
2.0,"Had it for a week, and the silver color wore off where it rests on my skin.  It holds the shine 2, but don't expect it to be pretty for long."
2.0,Material was too thin for a jogging suit for oersons living in a cold climate. Wearing as pajama loungewear.
2.0,This item size did not fit correctly and seemed too tight for a XXL.
2.0,"Love the look and style but 6 months later, the chain is broken."
2.0,Size up!  I‚Äôm a size 10 and bought an XL. It was WAY too small! Otherwise a cute skirt.
2.0,Good materials bad craftmanship
2.0,I never wore the top. It just looked to cheap.
2.0,They were to big I got xl and they‚Äôre super stretchy
2.0,"This was marked as one size fits all but it arrived in a size small and it has no stretch. If you‚Äôre like me and have a broader rib cage, do not order the shirt."
2.0,These shoes were tight fitting and smelled Bad. Some really weird leather. I had to return them though they look cute.
2.0,"Velcro straps in the back, thought they were circular  - one size fits most, not for big heads"
2.0,I had hard time put them on n omg takin off I scream in pain my daughter had to pull them off felt like skin was ripping off put back n box n closet never again
2.0,The product seems different .... it is flannel . So is more for winter than for summer or fall. the collar came a little crooked.... and I still thinking if I should to stay wirh it.
2.0,"Es bonito, pero se rompi√≥ coloc√°ndomelo, la cuerda se desarma, no lo he podido usar"
2.0,I did not like the fabric. The pleats and waist band were nice and the length was perfect. However following the size charts resulted in a skirt that was too big for me.
2.0,They broke fairly quickly after I got them. :(
2.0,"Was as expected. Looks and fits great! Love Breaking Benjoamin and this mask shows it, thanks!<br /><br />UPDATE: I haven't had this mask a month and it's already came apart....I've wore it a couple times and when I'm not wearing it, it stays in the outside zipped pocket of my purse. So I really don't know why it came undone as it did"
2.0,"This was a great watch band. It fit perfect for my 5x Sapphire. However, the quality was lack luster. The band was kinda rough on my wrist, and the wholes seemed like the placement could have been slightly different for my wrist, (neither of those are the end of the world). However, after only having it for two days, I was walking in a door, hit my watch on the door frame and the small metal rod that this bad uses in the connection to the watch, snapped and rendered the band useless. Gave two stars for fit on watch and the patriotism. But if your gonna buy a band for this watch, go with something else"
2.0,It wasn‚Äôt what I expected
2.0,Doesn't look exactly like the picture.  The moon is larger (too much so) and the the little rhinestone accent actually hits more near my belly button. Feels cheap but it was....
2.0,It says men‚Äôs 4 pack in the description and the title but yet I only got a two pack.
2.0,Arrived smooched
2.0,The rear panel kept slipping down<br />Would not recommend
2.0,Turned color after two wears
2.0,Skirt was way to small (followed the chart) and the fabric is so thin and cheap feeling im concerned it would rip if I even tried to wear it. It looks as expected if you can look past the faux Corduroy and the zipper is functional. Just not worth the price in my opinion. Sending back
2.0,Great fabric - felt great on - felt great to wear but stretches out during the day and ends up as a necklace.
2.0,turned yellowish color after two months
2.0,You get what you paid for but these are below average and I wouldn‚Äôt waste your time buying. The shorts underneath show and the waist band is already stretchy from just a few wears. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
2.0,"I ordered these boots for my wife but ended up giving them to her mother as my wife could not get them on her feet. What's more, if she had tried any harder to get them on, I'm sure they would have split at the seems. They felt very cheaply made. The inside felt like they were lined with foam. If you can get the size right, they might be good for a Halloween costume, but I don't see these lasting for everyday wear..."
2.0,I want it to be cute. It doesn't fit as long as it does in the picture. It's more of a chiffon material so your going to get hot wearing it. So much potential but it fell short but what do u expect for something under $20
2.0,"I ordered a 4X because a 4X blouse is large and loose on me, and I wanted a comfortable bra just for modesty under nightgowns when we have family visiting. This bra is very tight and the cups are small even with a bra extender added to the front.  The 4x is probably a 40B or C. I'm keeping it only because I'm about to have gastric bypass and will need it in six months. If you are young and perky and don't need Support, it's pretty enough and probably smoothe under t-shirts."
2.0,Very basic.  Depends on your needs.
2.0,very cheap feeling material and design. returned.
2.0,The arm pieces were too big and the chocked seemed small
2.0,"I watched YouTube reviews and try-ons of these leggings, and I was sold. They were guaranteed squat-proof (not see-through.) I wanted them by Saturday, so I chose two day shipping at check out so that they‚Äôd be delivered on Friday. On Friday after the estimated delivery time, I checked to see where they were and Amazon said they‚Äôd arrive the next Wednesday. I opened them after receiving them several days late and tried them on bc I still wanted a nice pair of yoga leggings. They were squat proof, but this was about the only good thing about them for me. I got a size S/M. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô and 110 lbs. Because of my height, I‚Äôm used to a little extra fabric bunching at the ankles, but these had too much. There was also an excessive amount of fabric in the crotch area. I have no idea why there was so much fabric in the front, but it wasn‚Äôt ignorable. It would just bunch up and look weird, especially since my thighs are a little thicker. You‚Äôd have to be 5‚Äô5‚Äù for these to fit right in length & either have very wide hips or a little pouch of fat above your crotch in order to fill them out. I imagine if you have the right height and hip width they‚Äôd look nice; however, this whole purchase was an all around disappointment. Returning."
2.0,"Only earned 2 stars because the material is nice (stretchy) and it is a nice design.  Otherwise I would have given this a 1 star because it runs 2 sizes too small and the workmanship is poor and the issues with this workmanship passed by quality control.  The seam that is supposed to be hidden below the bust is level with the front of the bust (see photo).  The buttons are sewn on crooked line (see photo).  My wife is a size 12-14 and normally wears a Large in this type of dress.  I ordered an XL because the description said it runs small.  If it were not for the stretchy material, she would have not fit in this dress, so it is too tight (see photo).  So, she would need an XXL and given the sketchy workmanship and poor QC, it is not worth the time or effort to send it back and order another one.  Going back with refund to my Amazon account."
2.0,Elastic around waist. Short
2.0,"My bad, I expected 3 for $15....definitely wouldn't have ordered ONE of these for $15, disappointing."
2.0,"Hardware is gold, in the questions & answers 3 people said silver. it's really huge & heavy, weighs more than my current purse with stuff in it. Not using it all, giving away"
2.0,Too big my daughter couldnt use it for halloween .... :(
2.0,The sandals fit too large and I‚Äôm unable to comfortable wear them.
2.0,"Returned this item. Fabric was wrinkly. It barely bloused as shown on model and worse yet, one side bloused slightly and the other side not at all. It was quite short and I am only 5‚Äô3‚Äù."
2.0,They are cheap. They broke within probably 10 times of being used.
2.0,"Love the color, comfort and design. Sadly after 2 washes, the letters are already pealing off. Waste of money and you pay shipping to return. Thumbs down!"
2.0,"If you plan on just standing around these are great sandals... but you may be like me and want to move around from time to time. Since the top straps are SO loose, these don't even stay on your feet for very long before they are flung off like hokey pucks. I can fit almost all my fingers between the top strap and the top of my foot, and being an above average size male, that's wayyy to much play and no fun for me. Returning, sad because they otherwise would seem like nice comfy sandals."
2.0,Looks great! Looks to be exactly what I was looking for. Only thing one side is not turned the right way to be able to use it correctly. So it hooks securely on one side but sides and does not hook on the other.<br />Was Really looking forward to using it.
2.0,They fit well. But I chose the cat pajamas and received something else so that kind of sucks. It‚Äôs comfy though.
2.0,Material is comfortable but EXTEREMELY see-through. The upward curved neckline is also not flattering and seems unnatural.
2.0,"WIDE should be the main topic. I don‚Äôt have narrow feet, so I was surprised at the fit. Sadly we were traveling so I missed the return deadline or I definitely would have sent them back as I certainly can‚Äôt wear them."
2.0,"I like the clear opening, but I found that the clear part shows your breath and can get unappealing from the moisture. I could only wear it for a short time before it became uncomfortable."
2.0,"Pockets stick out, don't care for the material."
2.0,"I didn't like this one, it's not very sparkly. I have a bunch of other EVER FAITH brooches I love though, I'm collecting them for a bridal brooch bouquet. This one just wasn't the same as the others."
2.0,"The necklace looks nothing like the picture. It ripped the first day I wore it. There are better chokers on amazon, some even cheaper! Save your money."
2.0,"Got the smallest size in this vest and it was awful. After drinking out of the vest during a training run, it bounced ALL OVER the place and had nowhere to tighten it to make it smaller after having drank out of it. Also when filled to semi max capacity was just way too heavy for me personally (to be expected though!) Also the hydration tube just didn‚Äôt seem to stay put and I found myself battling that and the bounce which interfered with my run so I ended up walking about 7 of my miles home just because I couldn‚Äôt deal with this vest. Ended up buying a size XXS Salomon vest and I‚Äôm in LOVE!!! (For reference I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 100 pounds and 31 size chest around."
2.0,Nice color but not very feminine.  It smelled terrible when it arrived.  I sent it back.
2.0,The decor is quite contrary to what you see in the photo as it looks like some cheap print and it's too big for a normal trucker hat.
2.0,Broke immediately :(
2.0,bracket holding the face down broke the first time he wore it. Metal pieces very flimsy.
2.0,I'm a size 8 & these liners fit smaller than most. Very disappointed...they ripped within an hour.
2.0,"Needed a plastic sword for a costume and this was not anything like what it appeared. The ""blade"" is not a smooth finish but like 2 pieces of place that t. It appears silver in picture but is white. (After reading description later it did say white blade) I just looked at the picture. I think it would be fine if we weren't needing something that looked for realistic. Disappointed."
2.0,These are very short waisted
2.0,"Good quality, however they were a bit small. I ordered an XL in a few other colors which fit well. I don't know if it was just this pair or what. My other pants received 5 stars... however if they don't fit they can't be used, it doesn't matter how good the quality!"
2.0,"Just got it today. I love the style, I love purple and butterflies. Not impressed with the quite obvious white seams underneath where the two drawstrings are and where the fabric is sewn together. White thread why?? It just looks cheap...not well made."
2.0,Color not the same as pics whatsoever.
2.0,"Granted I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 1‚Äù and 265lbs, and while on my journey I can one day hope to fold these at the waist like I should be able to. The fit issues I have with these (both way too short and almost too small) are on me, however I urge anyone over 5‚Äô8‚Äù to avoid these and those and inch or two under that to buy in caution.<br />Not my favorite Fisherman‚Äôs Pants available on Amazon and with the ‚Äúone size firs most‚Äù as the only size I have to wonder if that sample population ever included America. The stitching grabs the leg oddly and I‚Äôd scarcely wear mine even just around the house."
2.0,i thought they were white  other wise i have them in black and love them  the cream color not so much
2.0,"These are bigger than the adult-sized ones I have. No chance of them fitting kids, unless you count older teenagers as ""kids,"" and even then they'll probably be too big. I'm 30 and they're too big on me."
2.0,"Arrived badly wrinkled, it is just unlined felt, doesn't look spiffy and substantial like the picture.  There should be a stiffener in the top to make it flat and support the rest of the hat, otherwise the whole thing kind of droops."
2.0,Not as pictured. Not as tailored as it appeared
2.0,The fabric is plasticy and looks like your wearing a cape.
2.0,"The zipper was broken upon arrival. (Did not have time to return it as it was needed for a play.) The first time my daughter put it on, the fabric ripped in the back. She ended up wrapping a sash around her waist to hide the rip and broken zipper.  It fit well and looked beautiful--just very poorly and cheaply made."
2.0,"Came damaged, I was bummed. It's also way more bright orange then the photo shows. I was disappointed to say the least"
2.0,This was pretty for about a day. It broke to pieces the second time I wore it
2.0,Not as spacious as advertised.  Zippers a little dicey.
2.0,Not recommended the stiching and cloth quality is not that good.
2.0,"Returning. Although very cute, the top part was way too big on me."
2.0,tried to put very difficult. not well made
2.0,Mask is thin and not made of pure cotton.  It is difficult to breath through for extended periods of time and the ear strap adjustment slides.
2.0,Real small
2.0,First pair I pulled out of the package had a hole in the toe.  Can‚Äôt say I was very happy about that. P
2.0,The neck strap was too short so the penis part is almost at my chest lol. Other than that the quality is pretty good for the price I paid. Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again sorry.
2.0,The sheet will slip out after a week or so.
2.0,"Unfortunately this is made to be disposable fashion which I hate.  I would rather wear things for a long time, but the print on these was totally faded after just one wash!  Disappointing because otherwise they're great.  Super cute, super flattering, great design.  I just wouldn't recommend due to quality issues."
2.0,I usually wear US size Large and since this was slim fit I ordered a size up (xl) and that too was too small. Guess I have to order XXL for it to fit correctly
2.0,I suggest if you purchase go up a size and if it‚Äôs not available please wait for your size to become available.
2.0,The velcro part behind the head is huge. Disappointed they fit awkwardly and are bulky. Bought 3 üò∂üòí
2.0,"This material is extremely thin! You can see right through it. I tried it on with black underwear & you saw my underwear & where it stopped & started. It also shows every imperfection in the body! So if you have any type of cellulite, be prepared to see it! If the material was thicker, this would‚Äôve been a nice outfit."
2.0,Followed the sizing chart and recommendations but still ended up too large. It looked like i had a saggy behind.
2.0,Doesn't last like long
2.0,I had to completely untie the back and leave it open. I ended up not wearing it with my costume. It pushed everything down. Definitely not what I thought.
2.0,I returned this dress because it is very cheaply made. It has absolutely no stretch or fit to it. It's really Scratchy on the inside and just overall not made well.
2.0,"Didn't look as good as it does on the photo, at all. Kinda disappointed. I really wanted to like it. But it's probably just me. I'm sure they'll look good on someone else :)"
2.0,Too tight!
2.0,"These boots were super cute, but they seem to run small.  I ordered my childs true shoe size, but they were tight when she tried them on."
2.0,I had been very happy with this bag up until my last use. One side of the bag completely ripped open from the seam. I know bags can be damaged by the airline but this bag has only been a carry on. Never as a checked bag. Very unhappy as it probably has been used only 10 times even tho I‚Äôve owned it over a year now.
2.0,"Terrifying color. It was not the nice dark shade of purple/maroon as shown in the picture. Rather, imagine the purple Barney the Dinosaur was. It was like that purple, but a tad bit brighter. Its an eyesore.<br /><br />Two stars though because the wallet is nice enough. The color though..ugh"
2.0,"useless cheap, will work for few days, should cost $2"
2.0,"Omg! These are the worst house shoes ever !! The pics look like they are comfortable because of all the fur, but when you wear them they‚Äôre extremely uncomfortable because the sole is hard ! Your feet will be throbbing after walking in them !!<br /><br />I‚Äôm irritated because I wasted my MONEY!!"
2.0,Bought this for my very very petite granddaughter. She is a size00 women's. This shirt in a small fits my 2 year old granddaughter. The large fits my 5 year old granddaughter. The granddaughter I ordered this for will have to purchase a different one elsewhere.
2.0,Just didn't fit my body style very good.
2.0,"Made out of a scuba type material, does not feel like a sweatshirt"
2.0,The buckle comes loose very easily so it is likely to fall off.
2.0,"Item came ahead of schedule! Cute! But little smaller then expected. Still no biggie, but there was a red dime size stain on the front of dress."
2.0,It‚Äôs too tide and small I did what the table size I need an XL instead
2.0,Hoodie looks just like the picture shown. It definitely runs very small and the sleeves are very thin! It would have been Alot better if the hoddie was as heavy on the sleeve like it is everywhere else.
2.0,I return this dress the material feels like a shower curtain.
2.0,Worst directions ever. Literally took four hours to put together. The directions were written by someone who doesn‚Äôt understand that crappy non informative pictures are NOt directions. Be ready to spend a ton of time trying to figure out this gibberish.
2.0,Was yellow
2.0,Wish they were adjustable. Fit big on me.
2.0,Yellow fabric was completely see-through. I had to return it.
2.0,Not very sticky and barely pushed anything up.
2.0,"I was looking forward to receiving this belt, but like most items that I buy online that are brown, it is orange. I am unable to wear it. Is very orange."
2.0,"Is a nice mask, but received package broken."
2.0,"I initially liked these--cute lace, sticky all around, and little gripper dots on the bottom. But--they run a bit small and they started falling apart after one wearing. Very disappointing."
2.0,Elastic band that holds watch in place stretched out after one day of my son wearing.
2.0,"They don't really fit comfortably and fall down no matter how I tie them. The waist is too big and loose even folded over, and they don't fit comfortably at the crotch area either. Also waaaay too short. They're supposed to be pants, not knee shorts. And I'm a short person. Also, the material feels like burlap."
2.0,"I purchased several (5) tops from this brand at one time, and all but one is a total waste of. Pulled them out of their packages and immediately washed according to instructions... cold on delicate cycle and hung to dry... the worst shrinkage I have ever seen!!! Not the fixable kind, either. The fabric was NOT preshrunk before cutting and stitching the pattern together, that‚Äôs for sure. TotL waste of money and very disappointing, since they looked cute out of the package. This Is the only one that didn‚Äôt shrink, however, because it is made from a slinky t shirt-like material... this is NOT a good thing, though!!! Every time I wash it, it comes out smelling like a SKUNK!!! The smell goes away as it line dries, but don‚Äôt make the mistake of putting it in the dryer. The smell comes back and permeates the other clothes in the load. I only ever use delicate cycles for my clothes, so nothing ever gets HOT in the dryer, even. OH, and when I wore it outside in the 95 degree heat, the skunk smell came out again!! Talk about embarrassing!! I don‚Äôt understand why something would smell like Skunk when it gets wet or hot, so it‚Äôs going in the trash bin with the rest of my Sonja Betro purchases."
2.0,The color is very orange and material is very polyester synthetic
2.0,This band did not fit for my 42mm moto watch.
2.0,Masks is too small.  Looks like made for a child
2.0,Loosely knitted to the point of sliding down legs. I am not a skinny legged person but not overly thick in the calves.  Did not recoup shape when hand washed and laid out flat.
2.0,Stitching started pulling out on my first outing. Clips are not stiched on so they pull off way to easily. This sack is not good for weekend camp trip. It is good for every day carry though.
2.0,"I had ordered five of these previously. I was giving them out as gifts and one person had to come back to me with it due to the clasp breaking.  It was working on the pendant itself at first, however, it didn't last for very long. As in one ore two openings before it broke. You do get what you pay for. Maybe not that much. They're held together by thin piece of metal at the top just below the chain. The piece holding the chain onto it is also very thin and flimsy and would take very little to break.  Unfortunately, this occurred AFTER I ordered more!  To return them would lose me a bundle in shipping charges!"
2.0,"This shirt is just way too small and awkward fitting. No way should the pockets be right under my boobs. Also, the material is a new cheap that I‚Äôve never seen on clothes. The photo is off and looks nothing like this fuggly shirt. I laughed hard. It arrived fast and was cheap-2 stars."
2.0,"Cheap looking, not very regal looking."
2.0,This is going back.
2.0,Just received. They look exactly as pictured but feel very cheap. The lenses seem like they could fall out any second.
2.0,"Bought these hoping they would keep my fingers warm outside in Wisconsin winters.  Wore them this past weekend after doing the initial charge overnight, while plowing my driveway in my UTV.  Set gloves to max temp (RED) setting.  Temperature outside was around 0 degrees F. I could feel some heat on the tops of my fingers but the thumbs quickly froze with no perceptible notice of any heat.  Finger heat was barely adequate.  Within 20 minutes I had to stop and put on my normal winter mittens.  I guess if you're from a southern state they might work for you.  Total bust for Wisconsin winters.  Returned for a refund as they don't work as advertised."
2.0,The quality is not what I expected. It material was thinner than expected. Definitely did not meet my expectations.
2.0,Size is way off. XXL turns out to be between medium and large. There is no stretch at all so a perfect fit will be very difficult.
2.0,Kept opening & fitbit kept falling out.  I had to quit using it for fear of losing my fitbit.  Chain tangled & knotted & couldn't get the knot out.
2.0,This is a woman's jacket. It fits and look like a woman's. The buttons look girly as well. I ordered an XL but received a medium.  The cost of the jacket is too high and should be in the $20 range
2.0,"Not as described, ordered &#34;daughter&#34; and received &#34;daughters&#34;."
2.0,Wore this as a night shirt and it left a black smudge stain on my sheets that won't wash out.
2.0,The Leather is cheaply made and it stinks. I open it late or I would have returned it again. I won't recommend it to anyone.
2.0,Very flimsy and lightweight.<br />Scratch easily. I fully expect these to fall apart quickly.
2.0,"Socks are durable with thick fabric, but I doubt I would've bought them had I known the pattern didn't go all around and the back was just white."
2.0,My snap fell off when I first put item on.
2.0,This is a size 7 dress. Not 4. Beautiful dress though.
2.0,Buckle broke on first flight use. I have a samsonite buckle that has been through many flights and it‚Äôs still intact. Don‚Äôt expect high quality/longevity from these.
2.0,It brooke with a month worth of use.
2.0,"Advertised as being organic cotton, but nothing on packaging or masks indicates that"
2.0,"Fabric is super thin, would need a slip. Had to return because though it‚Äôs a sweet dress the thin fabric hung to make it look like a night gown."
2.0,It looks a bit different from the photo
2.0,"They're ok, you really get what you pay for. They don't even come in a jewelry box, just a plastic bag."
2.0,The shoes are very cute but definitely not true to size! The size 8 fits like a size 6! Terrible.
2.0,The band comes apart along the edges and snags my clothes
2.0,"The metal is nice sturdy but the image design had a large bubble under it which made a ripple, and within a day it burst and now it has a hard ripped edge around the entire inside of the charm distorting the image. I wanted this to show my pride as a dispatcher and from a distance it is nice but the image on charm itself is horrible quality I suggest finding this somewhere else"
2.0,Outfit a little to big....I can't wear it really need a med large would be much better never gave a chance to put size in now I'm piss not give vonh it away just sad I can't order no more
2.0,"Arrived quickly. Must say I was pretty disappointing with how bright the gold is. It looks super cheap and if I wanted to wear it with any other gold jewelry it looks even worse because of how bright it is (almost yellow)!  I packed to take on a trip with me the week after it arrived and when I got to my hotel and opened my jewelry bag, the legs on one of the elephants were gone.. I guess they broke off in my bag during transit.. so it was a pointless purchase"
2.0,"It doesn't look anything like the picture. It is short, and is not fitted in the torso like the picture."
2.0,"Love the dress, but I ordered brown and I was sent bright orange. :("
2.0,We‚Äôve only had them for one week and the magnet has already come off the belt.  They are very easy to use and I‚Äôm just going to glue gun it back on but super cheap.
2.0,The dress was ripped in the back before I even opened the bag. The dress looks flowy but there is a mermaid-tail slip that is very constricting.
2.0,"When i ordered these i could not have been more excited. Never have to tuck my shirts in again? Sounds amazing right? Well it would be if the teeth of the clips werent made of flimsy plastic. They worked great up until about the 2nd week and the teeth gave out. They wont stay clipped for even a second now. If your going to get shirt stays, buy some with sturdy teeth, preferably metal."
2.0,"I've been wearing the bands with my Garmin Fenix 6 sapphire for the past 2 months. The material quality is good, there's no scratches or discoloration. However if you push the band to the left or right, the pin compresses and it pops out of watch case. If it was within the return period, I definitely would have returned it."
2.0,"Yeah, it's a cheap product, but the front of it was all scratched up on arrival.  Given the cost, it wasn't worth worrying about."
2.0,a lot smaller than i had thought
2.0,Like the bangle however it doesn't keep track of time. Second hand is broken.
2.0,Smaller width than expected.
2.0,Very loose and not what I expected.  Tried to return it and the bar code wouldn‚Äôt work.  Very stretched out feel
2.0,Cheap. Came with defect so we return
2.0,"I fell in love with the color on the ad. However, when the pants arrived I was disappointed to say the least. The color is dull, ok I guess I could live with that, but the worst part is the fabric is not at all soft as you'd expect from a pair of sweatpants. I'd have been better off buying a pair of Hanes from WalMart. Basically you're paying for the brand name. But the quality is subpar."
2.0,"I‚Äôm certainly not tall and when worn higher on the top (as they are supposed to fit) the bottoms don‚Äôt even touch the ground, making it look silly with a shoe with any heel (Or any shoe really). Already washed them hoping they would fit better, so I can‚Äôt return. They fit well otherwise now, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend bc the length just doesn‚Äôt make sense."
2.0,Not nearly as fleecy as the picture. And one of the two pair was more like a child size. Too small for me.
2.0,Even though the sweater is fine it was sized extremely small for an XL... I normally take a medium to large and wanted something big and baggy so ordered an XL... This sweater is barely a medium on me.... disappointed....
2.0,it fits too small
2.0,I returned it because there was a flaw in the print in the front of the dress.
2.0,So disappointed. I ordered the red wrap skirt and it‚Äôs adorable. Decided to order white and it‚Äôs 1/4 of the size of the red.  No way to wrap around an adult woman.  ü•≤
2.0,"It‚Äôs a cheap rose gold color with dinged up marks all over the buckle, looking like it is used. Very cheap looking and not at advertised. Disappointed and will be returning."
2.0,"Fine enough quality for the price, but it is definitely not made for more than a c-cup.  I am a short, stout, 40-42DD.  I ordered the 14/XL with the thought that the bottoms would be loose (they were, but not impossibly - I'm usually a 12-14 bottom), but the boobs might fit.  The top fit comfortably except for the underwire bra support, which left at least the bottom half of each boob hanging out.  Bummer, because it's cute."
2.0,The stitching on it is horrible. IP's everywhere. The stitches on the right pocket came off and the pocket was just hanging. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is cause it's really warm.
2.0,Somehow it wasn't what I expected. It's really bright and loud. I thought the gold would be soft.
2.0,"the gauge isn‚Äôt specified, they‚Äôre all thrown together in one baggy, missing some pieces. it also came two days late.<br />edit: i‚Äôve decided to return them because there‚Äôs too many missing pieces"
2.0,Not a great product. The zipper doesn't stay closed.
2.0,Did not look like picture when ordered
2.0,"The hoods on these hoodies are overly large and very heavy, so I have to keep pulling the front of the hoodie down to keep from feeling choked."
2.0,This dress hangs really strangely if you have any curves at all.
2.0,They look to Cheaply made to even wear. Gas station sunglasses are a better option.
2.0,I did not like the fabric.
2.0,"It doesn't look like it did in the picture, but i do like this one more than the green one i got that looked just like this one. THought it would look better in person."
2.0,"I thought these glasses were going to be bigger(because in the picture, the frames look quite large). The glasses fit comfortably but the frames are small/normal size. If you have a round face, these frames will look sort of small."
2.0,OK for the price but not as exciting as we had hoped.  It might be worth your while to look at more options.
2.0,"This outfit was ADORABLE for like the few seconds it lasted.<br /><br />Really cute, poor quality...but with the intent to have it for one night"
2.0,"Shoe runs small, order the next size up."
2.0,"The one size fits all... did not fit my over hips without tearing it a little. I was concerned when I pulled it out of the package and saw how small the waist looked, but I saw the velcro opening in the back and figured it opened plenty. It opened only a little bit which was not quite enough to go over the widest part of my hips, so I tore it just a tad getting into it. I'm a standard size 8. That's my only complaint. If it's one size fits all, I would think it should have enough access for a larger variety of standard sizes. I'm not petite nor plus size. Otherwise, the product was just as expected. Unfortunately, this didn't work out for me."
2.0,"Well, the colors and fabric were decent. The issues i had were both pockets had hige holes, and this terrible lining! It comes from the top to about mid thigh, and its so tight that i didnt think id be able to wear it at all, and id ordered one for my daughter. I ended up cutting out most of the lining, its not see through, but its pretty sheer. Its cute, and it fits about right, but i dont think it was quite worth the altering that needed done. Ive read pretty mixed reviews on this romper, so i almost expected some issue when they arrived, just not an issue you'll want to mess with, especially if you dont sew."
2.0,"I ordered a Ceiling Light Blue shirt because dress code at work, but received a teal top. I would not recommend wearing this shirt without any shapeware unless you are a 00. Every bump shows."
2.0,"PRETTY COLOR, THIN BUT STILL NICE, BUT VERY SKIMPY.  DISAPPOINTED."
2.0,"Gold buttons instead of silver (which might not be a big deal if I hadnt bought silver jewelry specifically to go with it for a funeral) & the pants are not tapered in the least...at best theyre straight legged.  Theyre sung in the hips, large in the waist & AT LEAST 6 inches too long w/ about a 3 inch hem. The jacket fits in the bust but is easily 4 inches too large in the rest of the body.  The sleeves are about 3 inches too long. (For reference, Im 5'7""  36"" bust, wear a standard US size 6 ,  & following the chart, bought a medium)  Fortunately I have time to get it altered, but Im guessing itll cost about what the suit did....so overall not a good deal.  The fabric is heavier than expected (not necessarily a plus, but at least it's not chintzy)....so if youre an Amazon whose body temp runs cold & are looking for a suit thats kinda like the one theyre supposed to be selling, look no further."
2.0,"The blouse is not as i expected, does not fit in the body."
2.0,The holes were right in the breast area and I did not like how it looked on me.
2.0,"Really happy with the bag when I bought it, but has not lasted. One zipper broke, then the handle strap broke, and the hook on the shoulder strap broke. Have to buy another bag."
2.0,My daughter did not like it. It was too small and hurt her head. She is only 8
2.0,"Unfortunately,....poor quality. I almost ripped the buttons off trying to unbutton them to try it on. Scratchy poly fabric. Cheap presentation overall."
2.0,Thin and not the best shape - literally will only use this for around the house with jammies
2.0,Looks just as shown but too tight for my 9year old sons face. Had to return.
2.0,Smells like  gasoline.  Not sure how they make the shoes but the material stinks.
2.0,The stripes were black and grey not black and white. Not happy about it.
2.0,My daughter was disappointed in the prominent &#34;Stitches&#34; in this mask.  I know they are part of the Catwoman story -- she supposedly made the mask herself -- but daughter still didn't like it.  She wanted something sleeker and more finished-looking.  Explanations about authenticity did not change her mind.
2.0,"This is quite adorable in person. However; With a BIG however; it's a very cheap onsie from a different country (size says 90) and the neckline is totally stretched out. I can probably deal with that. The worst part about it, though, is that the adorable football diaper cover cuts off the writing on the onsie! Defeats the whole purpose of having the diaper cover! Unless you're buying it for the onsie in that case not worth it for the price! Very disappointed and would not recommend this!"
2.0,"The way that came fold it, its really out shape dont know how to put it back in shape.  My wrtie another review to see if I was able to fix it."
2.0,"I like the colors and print, but the style seemed very small in comparison to 10 petites to which I am accustomed."
2.0,Broke too easily!!!
2.0,"Looks good, not very durable."
2.0,Go up at least 2 sizes.... Cute shirt tho
2.0,They just aren't what I thought they would be
2.0,"Shoes are too large...sad, because they're for my grandson, and it took so long to get them that I know I can't get them exchanged in time for Christmas."
2.0,"The blue one broke in the 3rd day, and both of them are not fog resistant!! I have to take them off and wash them every 2 minutes in order to get a clear vision again!"
2.0,"I thought this looked so cute, but it's definitely geared towards people with a larger bra size. I'm a B34 (if even) and I have to work at getting it to fit/look good. I have yet to wear it because I didn't have time to fix it up, but when I put it on, one shoulder tends to droop, which exposes my bra (or more if I wasn't wearing one). I have a deep plunge bra, but it was still visible so I was trying to use a pin to bring the V tight and stop the exposure view. I didn't have time to get the pin in place to look decent, but it seemed like it could work. Otherwise, it was very comfortable. Didn't look as cute in person as I though it would, but I'm determined to make it work. I would suggest that if you wear a smaller bra size, this isn't for you."
2.0,Product (teal band) broke after only 3 wears.
2.0,Weirdly shaped
2.0,Hahaha literally laughing at the fit. I ordered up a full size but it‚Äôs still about 3 sizes too small.
2.0,"Nice chain, came very quickly....but, after wearing it twice, the spring in the clasp is broken.  It's still usable, just have to pull the wire out because it scratches my neck, but then what's the point of having a clasp?"
2.0,The pads do not fit my Bolle Sunglasses and the sender does not include any contact information other than a mailing address.
2.0,My granddaughter‚Äôs mother washed these before she wore them .....shrunk 2‚Äù.
2.0,Unfortunately the dress had spots on the front and back of the blue top. It appears to have been bleached.
2.0,This wasn't as flowy as I'd expected. It was boxy and the fabric has no stretch. Can't wear it.
2.0,I did  not like that they were so small
2.0,Nice belt but I have a 32&#34; waist so I ordered the 32&#34; belt thinking that would be perfect. Turns out the belt is exactly 32 inches so it's kinda small. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.
2.0,So disappointed!!! I was so excited for this cover up to come too. I am going to Hawaii next week and was looking for a pretty cover up. First off it's tiny. Nothing like the picture at all. It barely covers my butt and doesn't come close to closing. It won't go past the middle of my boobs. The front ends are sewn poorly. One is at a point and the other a square. It looks nothing like the picture in regards to size and quality. I would not recommend this item.
2.0,Seams are all slanted and the overall fit is not flattering. Can‚Äôt tie it tight enough to show curves.
2.0,Not real stainless steel at alllll
2.0,Cute! Sized wrong.
2.0,Material was not as expected and the fit was very strange. I was looking for work out pants but these were not it.
2.0,I ordered an xl cause I like my shirts loose fitting. Fit most everywhere a little more  snug than I prefer but not bad. I had to return though because the sleeves were ridiculously short! It could almost be 3/4 length sleeves. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù so it not like I have super long arms. Otherwise I would‚Äôve kept it... just need to adjust sleeve length.
2.0,This dress was very poorly constructed. I can not recommend this to anyone that actually wants a dress they can wear in public.
2.0,I was excited to order these because I had bought the ombre grey version of these and absolutely loved them! I had to buy another color because I loved the other ones so much. Then I got them and the material is totally different its like shiny and see through. It was so disappointing since it was the same exact brand. Definitely can not wear them to the gym they are totally see through.
2.0,"Cute charm but began to tarnish 1 month after purchase. Go ahead and spend the money on the real pandora charms, it's worth it."
2.0,"I am so disappointed that this bra didn't end up fitting because it is honestly very pretty and soft. My rating is mainly based on the information from the product listing and the seller (In the Mood Intimates) because the bra itself seems well constructed. The band is very firm which would be excellent for support.<br /><br />I have owned a lot of Parfait bras and was somewhat confident that I knew the size I needed but would have preferred to check a size chart because I was seeing US sizes listed and was under the impression that the bras are usually listed in UK sizing. I was nervous buying from a seller that wasn't fulfilled by Amazon especially knowing that returns were unlikely to be free if sizing wasn't what I thought. It turns out the seller I purchased from charges a $10 restocking fee and doesn't do exchanges, which was not listed on their policies page on Amazon. This seems pretty steep considering how likely people may be to need to return this bra so I don't think I will be reordering.<br /><br />I don't know if it would have been easier to buy this bra if I was a more traditional cup size but I wouldn't suggest buying it from this seller, it would have cost me just as much to buy from a different website or an amazon affiliated retailer and I would have been confident that I could return it to try to order another that way."
2.0,This was a lot bigger than I thought and not very efficient to carry around at all!
2.0,Cheap like materiel
2.0,"I expected this ‚Äúruby‚Äù ring to have red stones. They are definitely pink. I got this for my daughter whose birthday is in July. I‚Äôm super disappointed that this isn‚Äôt even close to looking like rubies. Since they are ‚Äúcreated‚Äù stones, I anticipated that the color would be controlled. :/ She lost a very special ruby ring and I got this for her for Christmas to replace it. Her ONLY request was that it have rubies. It‚Äôs two days before Christmas and I‚Äôm stuck with a pink ring."
2.0,They were too big. I passed them on to someone else.
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7.75‚Äù,  this coat was too long and not thick enough.  It falls below my knees."
2.0,Too loose! go a size smaller!
2.0,"Nice and soft, comfy and nice looking."
2.0,It's too tight.
2.0,Really tight and has cheap metal.
2.0,Fabric is very thin and didn't hang the way I expected it to. Will be returning this.
2.0,gold plated was fading at the bottom after just the first wear.
2.0,"The sleeves on this were pretty even though the fabric was very stiff and scratchy. My main issue, and why I chose to return it, was that it's very boxy which made it unflattering. It's cut like a men's t-shirt and I tend to prefer shirts that are slightly tapered in at the waist. The return was easy and quick."
2.0,"Very sheer, fit was a bit weird the length and the width did not complement each other not at all like pic"
2.0,Too baggy i wish it was more fitted so that my opponents cant grab onto my gi so easily
2.0,"I liked the soft stretchy rayon and spandex knit fabric.  I found the wide vee neckline flattering. I like the pattern, and the color choices.<br />BUT, by cutting the sleeves into the body of the dress, with a narrow armhole, it made it nearly impossible to lift up my arms, even to keyboard or steering wheel height. The other problem I encountered was the  insertion of pockets in the side seams of the dress.  The weight of the added fabric of the pockets distorted the a-line and added bulk right at the thigh area.<br />I have other rayon knit tunics and swing dresses which hang smoothly and are flattering, but this one does not work and I am sending it back."
2.0,"They looked cute, but were poorly made and too small"
2.0,Child did not like how they fit around the eyes
2.0,Stretches out of shape and wants to slide down over my hand.  I wouldn't recommend unless you had a large hand.
2.0,"Runs small, doesn‚Äôt offer much support"
2.0,"I liked the look, but. One broke the first night"
2.0,"I'm already a pretty slender person (5'4, 102lbs). I read the reviews and everyone stated that they were just too small. I thought they might work for me... but no. So small... I wouldn't buy unless you wanted to use these for your arms.. MAYBE your calves."
2.0,"The size was too small & there should have been a button on the bottom, but it wasn't there. Makes the shirt look awkward if not tucked in."
2.0,"I do like the cover-up; however, the first time I wore it, it tore at the seams on the shoulders.  I wore it to work, and I sit at a computer most of the day, so it didn't get a lot of activity.  Both seams pulled apart.  Fortunately for me, I have a sewing machine so I repaired both shoulders.  I like the top, but I don't love it, so I wouldn't buy it again.  The other two, however, seem fine.  Also, I'm a size 4, and it's a little bigger than I would like."
2.0,I thought the shoe came with a gold buckle instead it was black so didn't like them.
2.0,3 time wearing socks ripped around top<br />Poor quality
2.0,"I would give only one star review but this watch is comfortable and gorgeous.<br />However, the automatic part of the watch stops running every night.  No response on how to prevent this.  So I will probably be returning in next day!!!<br />Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,"Will only fit the smallest of wrists and it is all one piece, so you have to overlap it, which makes the back bulky. I can wrap my hand around my wrist with my finger and thumb touching and even with that small of a wrist this watch strap is still about an inch and a half to short to make the 3rd loop. It would go around the wrist only twice it makes it way too loose to stay on."
2.0,The necklace came broken inside the package had to send it back I got my refund it didn't look as good as the picture it looked more like a plastic felt really rigid kind of sharp in some places also I did see something else that was less expensivebut it looked way better than with this did
2.0,Daughter thought it was beautiful. I've had to glue it back together twice in two days.
2.0,As you can see in the picture the straps were ripped. Yes I can fix it so I don‚Äôt have to go through the hassle of sending it back and getting a replacement! Just be aware. Ours came like this and it‚Äôs never even been worn.
2.0,More of a kids size than grown woman
2.0,These figures broke off their posts easily
2.0,I was hoping that the zipper would be more durable. Now I need to figure out where to get a replacement zipper and sew in a new one. :-(
2.0,the fabric wasn't as I expected.
2.0,Get what you pay for I guess.  Lenses mark up really easily.
2.0,This does not have the toggle in back like the featured one has. I was disappointed bcz I‚Äôm trying to find one that I can tighten so it won‚Äôt slide down my face. And one that doesn‚Äôt have some obscure print on it. This one slides. It‚Äôs very soft and probably good for Covid but not for riding. Also seems more like a $5 face covering to me.<br />Sending it back since I have other things to return.
2.0,"The fabric on this dress was comfortable, but that‚Äôs about the only positive. It was way too baggy for me and not flattering whatsoever. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and this hit below my knees."
2.0,"Straps kept coming off shoulders and the fruit I was picking (lychee) worked its way out the bottom as I walked through the field.  May be fine for apples, but smaller fruit may come out.  It was made quite well and the materials were strong. It just didn't work for me."
2.0,"It is not a wool coat, but a glorified sweatshirt. Size up for sure."
2.0,"Seems like a decent quality shirt but reading reviews I thought it would run true to size, it does not. Runs small"
2.0,"Was expecting burgundy color, looks more like a dusty rose."
2.0,I ordered the red and the blue one I have not washed the red one yet but when I washed the blue one and it specified on the tag the bottom half of the shirt it now a different color than the ruffles.
2.0,"The sizing information is misleading. The one I received is FAR too large for a 42&#34; waist - on the smallest notch, the belt measured 47&#34; - the shoulder strap is likewise extremely long. While it's a good quality piece, it needs to be adjusted beyond the point of the accessory clips (D-rings, etc) being in an accessible place and would completely change the look of the item. Image shown is the belt on a standard 42&#34; fitting mannequin."
2.0,not terrible but the metal is cheap
2.0,to small even small as a shirt
2.0,Too short in the front to wear with leggings.  Back is much longer than the front‚Äî Otherwise it‚Äôs okay.
2.0,Very short - you need to be a size 0-2 to look like the picture
2.0,This may be good for outdoors in the winter. But it's as thick as a sweater and it's pretty small too.
2.0,"I was so stoked to get these boots because I've searched for months trying to find an awesome combat-type pair. I had a gift card and decided to try these. I wish I hadn't. The fit is okay. I wear a 6 and ordered a 6.5. With socks, they fit perfect and are reasonably comfortable. My issue is that the boots have no structure to support the sides so they tend to bag and sag and bunch up and look awkward. They make my ankles look like cankles. Also, the fabric shows EVERYTHING, picks up EVERYTHING, scuffs on EVERYTHING, and are super hard to clean off. They remind me more of old school '80s high tops than boots. It could be the jarring white line around the bottom that reminds me of sneakers but I think it's more about how bulky they are when they sag. At any rate, I would not recommend these to anyone. I will NEVER buy boots from this brand again. I regret this purchase terribly."
2.0,"The shape of the wallet, its compartments and credit card slots work for me but the quality of the leather is rough, if it is leather."
2.0,definitely not appropriate for 10 1/2. Good quality but too large.
2.0,"Packaging was bad. I bought a Size M, I weigh 146 pounds, I would not say it was tight but there was something about the look and fabric that made the dress look awkward. Not for my body type."
2.0,Verry very tiny
2.0,Some how this item got ordered but I did not order it and I returned it
2.0,Bought two one dec and April one  Diamond of each fell out and dog mom wore off on both
2.0,Cheaply made and pretty small for an infinity scarf.
2.0,I didn't pay attention to the size when I purchased it. The agate is the size of a quarter and the gold is kinda tacky looking.
2.0,"Wish I listen to the reviews. The strap is a joke, I couldn‚Äôt believe they would actually sell something like this ggfor $15. It isn‚Äôt even worth $.25 in a coin machine."
2.0,Shirt sizes does not match standard sizing even the chart they give you is not correct
2.0,Cute except the arm length was way too short.
2.0,This is so long and so big that i used it as a night gown. Enough said
2.0,Had it 2 months and it‚Äôs completely broken down. They bottoms all ripped off and the toe section wore through.
2.0,"Returning this product - digs into the bridge of my nose and can't adjust it on my bifocal glasses - no good for me, but they are cool looking."
2.0,"I can't get this to stay on my childs head.  He lost his other one at school and it was very similar to this one, but no matter how and where I velcro the back, it just slips down and falls off his head making it useless.  Seems good quality other than that."
2.0,Way to tight for swollen ankles and feet. Unable to put them on without a great deal of effort. Way to tight!
2.0,"Not for my body type, the elastic waist hits me in exactly the wrong spot.  I have large boobs and a leftover belly from having 4 kids.  Totally looked like a maternity dress on me, doesn't hit at the natural waist.  The fabric is great.  I would've preferred the same length all the way around...the sides were shorter than the front and back and were a little too short for me.  If I was keeping this, I would've worn leggings underneath."
2.0,I thought it was going to come with 5 and with that I was very disapointed to find that I had only recieved one keychain. I will be returning the item due to this inconvenience.
2.0,"The sleeves feel cheap, but the body part feels like a t-shirt. It is definitely not long enough! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But that's the gamble with buying clothing online."
2.0,I have issue with quality and sizing. Liked the Ajisai brand better.
2.0,"I don't like to look at them.  My wife took them apart and restitched them, which helps, but might not be worth it because of the quality of the material.  Give these to somebody that deserves them, that nosey, unpleasant aunt from Hoboken."
2.0,Poor quality material wise
2.0,"I ended up with bright orange. The picture shows the stomach straps splaying out like a fan. Well that's not really what they looked like when it came. They are almost straight up and down, and the top doesn't sit on my chest the way the model does although we have similar bods. I'm wondering if this was a knockoff?"
2.0,"Poor quality, it‚Äôs short and very thin !"
2.0,Not sure how this is listed as adjustable. But the biggest issue was one of the ear pieces kept coming off while trying to use them. Had to return them.
2.0,"Ordered an 8 (wear a 6 but opted for larger size) AND IT'S TOO SMALL! Fits like a size 4, if that.  Adorable dress though, might re-order is larger size - if do, I'll write a follow-up review."
2.0,"The fabric was thinner than I had hoped , seems silly to have to wear something under it but it‚Äôs to thin for my comfort level to wear in public"
2.0,"It just wasn't for me. I ordered this dress thinking it was a darker shade of pink, yet it came in and looked like the pepto bismol bottle pink. Which is fine if that's the color that you are looking for, but I wasn't this particular time. Other than that, it looks like the picture. The material was VERY THIN, and when I tried it on, it showed every curve. Ultimately, I didn't wear it to the event, because it just wasn't what I thought it would be. It may be perfect for someone else. If I could send it back, I would."
2.0,"Very tight, to short and ride low on hips. Not worth the money"
2.0,"Cheap material, & the ape doesn‚Äôt show."
2.0,smaller at the bottom than expected but cool design
2.0,This outfit is cute but the material is horrible! It kept rising up. I found myself pulling it down all day.  My abs should be tight and tined the amount of time I bent over to pull the bottom of the skirt down.  I bought black & royal blue. Fits nice!
2.0,"This dress is very, very short and has an awkward fit on top. I took it on vacation so had no choice but to wear it one night."
2.0,Wouldn't recommend if you like loose fits. Ordered a size up and it still just super bulky and awkward looking. Sleeves are too short and I like my sweaters longer than right at my waist. Adds pounds. Very hot.
2.0,"Purchased these shoes for my 10 yr old in Nov 2016. He was teased at school for wearing knock offs but he still loved them. He only wore them about a month before putting them away for the winter so they weren't in water or snow.  Now that the weather is better, we pulled them out and one doesn't work.  The company has not responded to my email for assistance."
2.0,Cheaply made but nice design on it. Runs waaaaaaay small! Hubby is a XL and this 3X BARELY fit!!
2.0,Material is on. Medium is larger than normal for women's size.
2.0,"This shirt would be great for someone nine months pregnant. For the rest of us, the fit at the top is cute but it's wayyyy too loose at the bottom. I've also only been wearing it for 3 hours and the material is already beginning to pill. I don't see this shirt lasting long at all."
2.0,It is a very strange fit.  The criss cross of the straps seem out of place when you try it on.  Fit smaller than expected
2.0,"Very thin material, rough on the inside, and iron-on work was not quality. My daughter was happy with it so we kept it, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone!!!"
2.0,"Not the same measurements as stated, not 40L, mine is a inch or 2 off size, nice bag, but not what I ordered"
2.0,They are okay but cloth is not as nice as other headbands which off-course are more expensive than this - I won't buy this one again
2.0,"I really like the feel of this fabric and the way it looks on my body. That being said, there were a lot of white strings around the stitching that was obvious and needs to be trimmed. For the price I paid, I would not expect to make repairs to the dress before I wash it the first time, much less wear it."
2.0,"I loved it. It was super cute. I used it as a keychain with one key and a car fob, and after a week it was gone. The ring and chain are still there but the actually pendant is gone. Who knows where it fell off. Very disappointed as I really thought it was super cute. Oh well.... don‚Äôt waste your money."
2.0,"I loved Foxcroft blouses in the past and was excited to find them on Amazon.  However, after ordering and returning several I have to say that the quality of the fabric is poor."
2.0,The insole cushion came out of one shoe after my child wore it one time.
2.0,It fit but was super awkward on me. I usually never have a problem with the fit on shoulders and chest. Plus it was see threw
2.0,I have to send my dress back. It‚Äôs way too small and wasn‚Äôt the fabric that my other dress is. So disappointed! This dress is the perfect style but it‚Äôs way too long and should be cotton/spandex not silky
2.0,"These tops are useless. Even to wear around the house. They constantly ride up, roll up- I bought for warmth during running- or to sleep in, or to wear under sweaters in winter- but they do not stay put. Even when sleeping- so uncomfortable. I just realized I had them a year later- and noticed them in my drawers- and bummed they never worked out."
2.0,First of all it's too small. I ordered large (supposedly US Medium) but it's smaller than my medium undershirts.<br />It's also thinner than my undershirts. My other turtlenecks are much thicker although not much heavier. I think this should be sold as an undershirt and not as outerwear. Also instead of being termed lightweight it should be called ultra-thin.<br /><br />It is soft and reasonably comfortable so I will end up using it as an expensive undershirt since it's too much of an effort to return.
2.0,Good material and soulfully constructed but the button is in a weird spot and is way too easy to press so the umbrella is always popping open when I want it closed or closing when it‚Äôs supposed to be covering my head. I‚Äôve had half a dozen spring loaded umbrellas in my life and this is the only one with the problem
2.0,I bought the red and the green elf pjs. They are super cute but the pants to the green set are not even! The right leg is an inch and a half shorter than the left... attached a pic.<br />The red one came just fine.
2.0,I bought one of these before and it was made of nice soft leather.  This one is a cheap vinyl.
2.0,LOOKS COMFY BUT THE STITCHING WHERE THE KNOT IS SO UGLY THAT YOU CAN'T HIDE.
2.0,I received the light grey purse.  It is NOT REAL LEATHER!  This is definitely synthetic material although the description states it is full grain leather. I'm very disappointed.
2.0,"It is a nice jacket, lot's of well-placed storage pockets and ventilation.  But the fit is awful for a tall, skinny guy.  I am 6'3 and 175 lbs.  The only way this would fit is if you are very short and very round.  This same jacket is sold under several brands.  They are all the same jacket."
2.0,This was really disappointing.  Super thin fabric. More like a long sleeve tshirt.  It was way too expensive for the quality.
2.0,"I ordered two sets of these to use for my three lobe piercings on each ear. I felt pretty confident in my purchase after ordering, but for each earring one of the backs (there is one on each end) fell off. They were all gone within 2 weeks. The earrings are very pretty, good quality CZ but they would just not stay in"
2.0,They seemed to fit ok but I couldn't get over the Very visible seam stitching. And even though I got them to be under shirts It just looked very cheap.
2.0,I like the way it looks but you can't open it wide enough to put a picture inside.
2.0,The arms and shoulders are very big otherwise good length
2.0,"These are really cute, but they run really small. I washed them and a XL is now a size small."
2.0,Well first thing it was small and hard see the Mickey Mouse. Then a week later the paint started coming off. Very disappointed with this item. Some valentine gift!
2.0,"Nice gloves but I tried one on and the seam ripped when I was taking it off.  I can sew it, but on my first try?"
2.0,"I reordered these as a 2nd pair as I liked the first pair, but they were showing a lot of wear after a year.  To my dismay and surprise, the manufacturer seems to have cut corners and made this pair smaller.  They do not fit over my glasses anymore.  I gave them away as it is too much boher to return them."
2.0,"I think this bracelet is so fun! Unfortunately, it did break shortly after I received it, within a few months. I love the design of it and will wear it again after I find someone to repair it. Mine broke at the hinge, so now it won't latch securely and is very loose, therefore, preventing me from wearing it."
2.0,It looks more suitable for a little girls costume.
2.0,I ordered this shirt. I have a lot of this type of shirt. And I usually stick to around the same size when I order them. This shirt fit across the chest just fine. But I would have to have arms  5ft long for the sleeves to work with this shirt. I normally wear a size 10 in clothes. And I did size up for this type of shirt because they normally run small in the chest area on me. This just fit in that area..
2.0,"Way too tight around the bust. I normally where a medium, but this medium just did not fit. Pretty dress though. Returned it."
2.0,"too thick for me, not comfortable as other compression socks I have worn.  I would not purchase them again"
2.0,"This is a very nice sweater. It fits well and looks great with jeans. But here is the problem.<br />After I had it on for one evening the stars are kept falling off so on the floor and in my car I kept finding stars.  After one wash, it barely has anymore stars on it and even though I did not dry it looks like it‚Äôs loose now."
2.0,Their sizing is way off. I'm 32in in my under bust region and this is just way too tight for a small.
2.0,as above WEIRD!!!!
2.0,Great idea but these things are entirely too small.  A large fits my 16 year old son w/ 30 inch waist!
2.0,"The tree on this anklet is sooooooooo small... much smaller than it appears.  My Husband said it looks like a stalk of broccoli.  Also, the chain is so incredibly thin, it will most likely break in nothing flat.  Will be returning.  Very disappointed as I had high hopes."
2.0,The square part that goes next to the ear lobe behind the earring digs into the ear and if you keep the back loose enough to make it not hurt it feels like it will fall out.
2.0,"I would think that their would be some quality control protocol in place, which would have taken 2 seconds by the person grabbing the item to put into the shipping box -yet prevented the unhappy customer lots of wasted time in logging into their account, writing a bad review, requesting a return, driving to FedEx to ship the item back, etc. Although a small & inexpensive item, I put much effort/thought/time (viewed many comparable items/read reviews/product material= metal, shipping timeframe, etc.) into choosing this extra little additional gift for my son's birthday, which will now be returned & even if I get another 1, won't be received in time. Everyone knows what a traditional soccer ball looks like. If it were just the black color missing in spots, I would have filled it in with a sharpie...but you can't fix black color bleeding all into the white areas -VERY SLOPPY & IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS to anyone that took a second to look."
2.0,Visually very cool but setting the time is almost impossible.
2.0,The cut was off around the legs.
2.0,It's not pretty in person. And the material and the chain are thin and tacky! NO!
2.0,it is cut strangely
2.0,The method of ataching the keys to the key case is poor.  Renders the case of no value to me.  If the case had been better described in the description I could have avoided what is to me a worthless item
2.0,No pockets. The draw string dangles/twists inside the waistband. Fits well and they‚Äôre comfortable.
2.0,"Didn't come with instructions on how to adjust the band - luckily you can youtube it and just use something small to lift the clasp to &#34;unlock&#34; it then slide it around.  Closing the clash was difficult but it's a cheap watch so I'm going to forgive all that and even expect that it loses its color over time.  However, this is not a $5 watch so I do have some standards.  The clasp that holds the two bands together do not &#34;click&#34; and stay put.  If you shake your arm. the clasp undoes itself and the watch falls off.  At the least, the clasp should actually work so I can wear it without losing it...  I could probably make it work if I tinkered around with it a little but I shouldn't have to for $50.  I ordered a silver version that should be delivered Friday so hopefully I don't have the same problem with that one as well.<br /><br />*EDIT* received my silver one and the clasp adjustment was much easier to open and close and stays shut so the rose gold one must be a defect and I will be returning and adjusting my review upon receiving a new one."
2.0,"I love straw/paper hats for the summer, they're lightweight, breathable, and even the packable ones hold their shape while on your head. Not this one. It's a stretch polyester material made to look like straw and it's completely limp and hanging in your face unless the brim is folded up, and even then the lightest breeze or bump and it falls down in your face again and it's not breathable. I'm disappointed because Siggi usually has great hats and I really liked the color combo."
2.0,Shrinks a lot and the blue is not quite as picture.  I would not recommend drying this item. Now it is too short to wear as it doesn't cover anything up.
2.0,Very big.I've returned it.
2.0,"I read the warnings but it looked so cute I had to order it anyway.  I ordered a 2x, I wear an 8, when it arrived & I tried it on, I figured they must have sent me the wrong size but 2x was written on the package, it is tight & the arms need to be about 4'' longer but if you aren't stretching your arms it's not that noticeable. The fur doesn't look like it does in the picture, the accent fur is darker than in the photo.  It is really cute though and I've waited since November to get it so I'm going to squeeze on in, keep my arms tucked up and try to make the best of it.:)"
2.0,"I am 5'5'', 145lbs with a muscular build. These bottoms are too small :(. I typically wear size medium-large in bathing suit bottoms because I have a bigger bottom half. Unfortunately, these bottoms gave me the &#34;double butt&#34; and a muffin top... I wish they had these in the side tie style so you can loosen or tighten at will."
2.0,"These are so tiny you can barely get them on.  I guess I mis-read their size.  They'd probably fit a six-month old, but no one else."
2.0,"I liked these shorts at first...they looked ok and the material felt great, but the more I wore them, the more I realized that they kept riding down in the back and just didn't fit right.  Maybe it's me and the way I'm made- tall and slim with no butt- but decided I didn't care for them.  They also have no fly opening even though they look like they do in the picture."
2.0,I could barely see the speedometer to know how fast I was going because these glasses are just too dark. They fit well but I just can‚Äôt use them they‚Äôre too dark.
2.0,Pretty lavender but the fit is really bad and fabric bunches at the knot.  Awkward look.
2.0,Returned this item.
2.0,"I wear contacts and at night the glare of headlights is just to much sometimes, so I bought these glasses hoping they would help. It's very strange. They dont reduce glare at all and in my experience made the glares seem brighter BUT the glare slightly hurt less. It sounds strange but that's how it worked. Had someone else try it and they said the same thing. I would not recommend these."
2.0,"Ordered this bracelet as a birthday gift for someone because of all the wonderful reviews.  When it arrived, the presentation was very nice, but when I took the bracelet out, it looked very cheap and bends extremely easily.  The inside almost looks like cheap aluminum.  Would consider this costume jewelry and not worth what I paid for it.  Very disappointed and ended having to buy something else."
2.0,"These almost look like they‚Äôve been worn - the leather has creases and wrinkles in the ankle part (which is way too loose) and the fabric part is wrinkly as well. The boots look old and definitely not like something should look you paid $200 for.<br />The calf is nice and tight though, I have a 14‚Äù calf and it‚Äôs difficult to find boots that fit. I‚Äôm bummed, in theory this is a really cute boot. One more thing that is very annoying and takes away from the look of the boot are the grey areas on the side of the soles, it looks like powdery white residue but can‚Äôt be wiped away."
2.0,I bought the XL and it is very wide and lacks shape. I‚Äôd recommend ordering a smaller size
2.0,"Much longer than pictured. Paper thin fabric, I will have to wear a shirt under it."
2.0,Cheap construction & sleeves too tight- why make a white dress so sheer?
2.0,"The dress is exactly as shown and fits like a glove.  The quality exceeded my expectations.  The skirt lining barely covers my arse but I'll layer white underthings regardless.  If you aren't busty, make sure you have a padded sticky bra otherwise the breast lining will droop.  I ordered a size 4 and I'm 5'7"", 142, 32DD, with a curvy muscular build.  The huge disappointment is that it arrived DIRTY.  My event is in a week so I don't have time to return it.  I'm hoping the dry cleaner can work some magic.  The waist line, front and back, has dark gray splotches all over it.  Super bummed and confused about it....it was individually packaged so it never should have passed QC because it was noticeable before I removed it from the clear plastic.  I would've given 5 stars but, well, no"
2.0,i thought they were too thick but i have petite hands
2.0,I was not happy with them. The beads left about a two bead space. Enough to see the band holding together.
2.0,"Bummer. Just got my scarf and it's not what was pictured. It's coral with teal horse and carriages all over. Kinda weird. However, It's super soft and decent quality. Will just keep it since it was so inexpensive."
2.0,The soles were completely messed up. One was not even glued down then the other one was stuck together from the glue. My daughter wore them once!
2.0,"The product description reads ""Made of top genuine leather braided with stainless steel metal clasp"".  The bracelet turned my wrist green the 1st day I wore it. I wear stainless steel jewelry regularly and it NEVER turns my skin green."
2.0,Material too heavy
2.0,The size is not perfect. Even after making the belt smaller it doesn't fit right on the hand.
2.0,"I had such high hopes for this dress. The constructions was good. The color was a perfect match to the photos. ( I ordered the teal) The lining was extremely short in the back and exposed my butt. I'm 5'9"" approx. 165 lbs. and I ordered the medium.  If you have even the slightest of curve or butt the lining may be too short. It was so cute on and fit perfectly but I could go out with the bottom of my cheeks out."
2.0,"IMPOSSIBLE TO IRON! Took forever and within an hour it was all wrinkly again [wore it for graduation]. Also, the plaids in the chest would not stay. The fabric isn't the greates either. It does fit as expected. I got a L and XL and went for the L. I did not love it [I'm a thick woman so it doesn't look great from the front, but looked GREAT in my profile since the skirt and fit trims my waist and shows posterior assets well lol]. Fabric is just tedious to maintain. Would not get again."
2.0,"These gloves run smaller than normal, making them difficult to get on and off. Moisture gets trapped in the glove after each use. I placed the gloves over a warm air vent and they were still damp 24 hours later. I expect to be replacing them with a different brand in the very near future. The gloves did keep my hands warm in freezing temperatures though."
2.0,The arms are extremely tight while the rest of it is extremely big.
2.0,This was shorter than I expected and I didn‚Äôt like the fabric.
2.0,This item delivered in a timely manner however I am very disappointed because 2 of the colors are so dark and not bright colors like shown that its hard to tell what color they even are.  I am also short one color.  It is suppose to be 5 of each in 12 colors.  I only got eleven.  These may go back....
2.0,You better order 1 size larger than normal
2.0,Sleeves too long and shoulders would not stay down on my arms
2.0,Not true too size
2.0,"I love the look of it. But its small in waist, huge in chest."
2.0,Sizing was way off!
2.0,"The bras are nice but I was sent the wrong size.  The black one has a tag that says 36B, when I ordered the size small (30A-32A).  The gray one doesn't have a tag but it feels like it's about the same size as the black one, which is too big.  Also, the two bras I ordered (came in a &#34;2-pack&#34;) are vastly different from each other.  They have opposite sided zippers from each other; the black one has a raw elastic band while the gray one's elastic is covered with fabric; and the black one is also more of regular style straps/back while the gray is racerback style (like the picture).  I don't really care that much about these differences I just wanted the correct size.  I will update my review if/when I hear from the seller and if they can/will help me out.  Since I am having my surgery in a week and the items took a week to arrive (I pay for amazon prime and they did not arrive on time), I can't afford to send them back in case the replacement doesn't arrive on time because I have to have something to wear after my surgery, even if it doesn't fit."
2.0,My wife is European so thought she would like these. I was wrong. She never wore them.
2.0,I wanted to use these charms for bracelets but decided not to because some of the words arent in English
2.0,"These arrived wrinkled and crushed, the point of shoulder pads is to add shape and since these were either manufactured and or packaged poorly  they had the opposite effect. I was disappointed ."
2.0,"tiny, tiny.  I dont have large ears at all and this didn't fit in my cartilage hole.  Really cute, too bad I can't wear it."
2.0,One trip overseas and the buckle broke.
2.0,"I ordered the XL and it fits more like a 1X. This isn't the first time I've ordered an XL on Amazon and it was really a 1X. The dress is very soft and it is a nice casual dress but like others have said the sizing is off. The bust is WAY too big, there is extra fabric underneath the armpit so it's saggy and makes it look frumpy. It's not worth returning for a Large. I'm hoping a few stitches and washing it will shrink the dress a little bit so the fit is better."
2.0,Nothing like the picture and definitely did not have much stretch at all. It made me look bigger than I actually am.
2.0,"I loved the bag when I saw it on the computer screen but when I bought it, it looked so cheap looking and hastily put together. Not worth your money I say."
2.0,"I've worn this bowtie about 10 times and multiple threads from the white dots are coming loose. It's almost unwearable now.<br /><br />Also, the sizing is way off from every other bowtie I own. I usually wear a 16 and on this it's an 18."
2.0,Quality of build seems okay for the money. Edges of frames feel a little harsh. Beware that these do not have spring hinges. This means they must fit your head width perfectly because there's no &#34;give&#34; to spreading the arms. And they measure 5&#34; across the temples.
2.0,"These are WAY too big. They should be described as toddler socks, not baby."
2.0,"First time i wore the watch, the band fell apart."
2.0,"These are great if you need very, very large earrings, or very lightweight ones. I altered these by removing the largest, longest piece, which makes it wearable, but definitely not my first choice. I'll probably rework again, adding a touch of bling."
2.0,"This rings is cute, but very light weight and feels like it could break.  I would recommend it for a kid, but I may wear it if it goes with a casual outfit sometime."
2.0,Save your money. Flowers fell off after a few days.
2.0,Felt like I was wearing them backwards. Most like.y return.
2.0,"This top is an atrocity but I did give it two stars because the fabric IS nice.  The rest of everything about this shirt is awful.  I am 5'10&#34;, 34DD size 12 and I ordered a Large.  The fit was okay around the chest and I didn't find that it was see through in any way but the cut is terribly unflattering.  The bottom part is wayyy to much fabric that is pleated, it could fit a 9 month pregnant belly underneath of it.  I'm already tall with broad shoulders and wide hips, I DO NOT need this type of extra fabric situation!  The front was longer than the back and even seemed to have more volume in the fabric making that much more odd looking AND the sides pouched out.  I tried it on for my husband just to show him the horrifying shirt I waited a month for (came from China) and he told me I looked like a little girl playing dress up.  Also the &#34;lace&#34; is cheaply sewn on and you can see the unfinished hem of the fabric behind it.  The lace also flopped around and was unevenly sewn in many places.  Normally I'll keep crappy clothes I buy on Amazon as lounge clothes but I can't even justify keeping this one..."
2.0,A bit smaller than the specs shown online. Leather quality not very good. Felt cheap. For $116 should be much better.
2.0,"Disappointed!!! The mask looks soooo faded. Like it has been washed 100's of times. I am not happy with it. My daughter was all excited until she took it out of the package. It is a good fit and I liked the adjustable strap (2 stars), but I would not recommend."
2.0,"I measured my leg prior to ordering xlarge.  I struggled to get them and finally got them past my heel, but then ran into serious trouble.  They began to roll and formed a painfully tight band that I couldn‚Äôt budge in any direction.  I had to cut them off with scissors.  I can‚Äôt even return them for a refund because I destroyed one sleeve saving my leg."
2.0,It wasnt the same product in the photo from when I got it in my hands. The product runs really smalls
2.0,Too tiny to appreciate.
2.0,"too small ,suitable for a women fit"
2.0,"Did not fit as expected, bulky fingers, could not open gates, grab twine on hay bales..needed to take them off for that stuff<br /><br />I felt a bit mislead"
2.0,i bought this s because the smallest size is small.. was too big for me and had to tailor it down. material is too heavy quality is so so.
2.0,"Very upset, got the order and the little ziplic the earrings were in.. Was in the sticky part of envelpe so when opened earrings went everywhere.... What a mess and disapoinment.!!!"
2.0,"I bought two of these.  While they‚Äôre very cute at first view, one of them broke the first time wearing.  The chain that connects it is the part that broke."
2.0,Laughably small. Ordered according to the sizing chart provided. The material was also a little thin for it to be a bathing suit. Sent it back.
2.0,Thought it was a skirt but its shirts and makes it ugly if you have thick thighs
2.0,"Very boxy fit, way too big<br />I sent it back"
2.0,"Very small, about the size for children or tweens. If I wear it, it can only reach halfway up my nose while still covering my chin, and if I were to actually laugh and forget to be careful, it can slip and expose my mouth or nose. My little sister will probably love them though!"
2.0,"Somewhat difficult to put together, but there are some youtube videos and the pictures help, but to make it taller, the suspender parts don't move, but you have to move the chest strap. This was terrible because if the suspender-like pieces were adjustable, life would be perfect, but no, you have to move the strap made to go ACROSS YOUR CHEST while to make them tall enough for me to actually wear, the chest strap sits UNDER my boobs. The knee parts are pretty hard to get in the right place as well, and they aren't adjustable to fit your leg size. And then while trying to get them in the right spot, the little criss crossy thing in back broke. I am not sure how you are supposed to put the apron on over this as well, seeing as the bets it covers<br />are partially attached to the hip belt?"
2.0,DESIGN IS CUTE. LOVE THE ROSE GOLD COLOR. FLIMSY AND RUNS SMALL. I ORDERED SIZE 9 FOR MY POINTER FINGER. THE RING ONLY FIT MY RING FINGER.<br />TJE PACKAGING WAS VERY POOR. IT WAS IN A LARGE MANILA ENVELOPE WITH NO PROTECTION OR CASE EXCEPT A SMALL BAGGIE. I COULD FEEL IT OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE. THANK GOODNESS IT WASN'T BENT IN HANDLING AND SHIPPING. THEY COULD HAVE PACKAGED THE RING BETTER THAN THIS.
2.0,I didn't realize it was made in Asia.  The large size is approx. to our size 12.  Had to return it.
2.0,This swimsuit was so cute on and fit well and then the thick elastic in both the top and bottom started twisting. It‚Äôs so bad that I can‚Äôt get it straight without completing re-sewing  the swimsuit from scratch. It‚Äôs very disappointing because this would have been my go to suit. It‚Äôs too twisted to even wear now. I‚Äôve never had a suit do this.
2.0,I am a little disappointed in this purchase. As I read the reviews as everyone pretty much liked the band and how the face part of the band snapped right over the Apple Watch face but my band did not come with the part that goes on the watch face... it was literally only the band part that adjusts on your wrists... I thought it would be a full band
2.0,The little purse arrived ripped on the inside.
2.0,The quality is not great. The item looks totally different than the picture. Disappointed.
2.0,Too small. Make sure to size up
2.0,I WAS EXCITED THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO FIT PERFECT. I BOUGHT AN XL AND IT WAS LIKE A HUEGE PAJAMA SHIRT. I'M 5 4 1/2&#34;  AND WEIGH 200 LBS + OR - A COUPLE AND THIS SHIRT WAS ALMOST TO MY KNEES. I RETURNED IT FOR A REFUND. VERY DISSAPOINTED. COLOR WAS PRETTY AND MATERIAL WAS NICE THOUGH.
2.0,They look better online than in person. They look very cheap. It's not worth the time waiting for it or spent putting them on. Not made good.
2.0,The image provided isn‚Äôt what it actually looks like it‚Äôs more like a burgundy color which is why I returned it.
2.0,"My daughter used her birthday money to purchase this item. It looked so pretty online and she fell in love with it. When it arrived I was shocked by the quality. The chain and closure are  like plastic. The locket is nice and my daughter does love it. But, it is frustrating how it is such poor quality vs.  and the amount she paid. And using her own money."
2.0,Looks like leather bot loop is made of cheap plastic and broke in less than a month .. junk especially at over 20 dollars  ...
2.0,I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY COULDN'T MAKE THESE BAGS WITH THE PRETTY COLORS AND BE DONE WITH IT! Do not like the bag when it‚Äôs outta the sunlight at all so sending back!!! Very disappointed bc I wanted this so bad!!!
2.0,I liked the purse a lot until one of the zippers wouldn't move. I threw away packing material.
2.0,Love the idea but this one is poorly designed.  The bladder pouch goes in the outer pocket so the weight of the water crushes everything in the main pocket.  Returned.
2.0,"This band does not look like the picture. The pink is faded. It does not look professionally made. I‚Äôm sad that I even paid for shipping. I really wanted a Snoopy band for my watch. Oh well, lesson learned."
2.0,"Looks great, but arms are very tight, I even ordered a large, where my wife usually wears a medium."
2.0,I guess I should have known that the dress wouldn't be as fluffy and movable as the picture... it was very flat and just laid there. I returned it with no problems and the company was very nice.
2.0,Turned wrist green after about a week which is really unfortunate. Not as rosey as the picture makes it look which I was fine with but a true rose gold lover might be disappointed.
2.0,The material is very thin and does not fit a small/slim person well at all.
2.0,Did not like the quality of the fabric. Will return it.
2.0,More bulky than the pictures
2.0,I wish I would have read the reviews first.  Cheap junk that broke after about 4 wears.  The lights are cool but the light controller is junk.  Next time I will check a little closer at the reviews
2.0,"My kiddo wanted a mood necklace that was also a locket, so this pack fit the bill. I wasn‚Äôt expecting too much for the price, but every single necklace in this pack broke within a few days, some when she was just trying them on for the first time."
2.0,Poor quality. Band keeps coming loose. Can't really wear it.
2.0,"Material was not good quality, very scratchy"
2.0,The bra was cute but the material did not stretch at all. I am usually a medium but bought a large. Could barely put it on or take it off and it was very tight once it was on but not because of the size issue but the material. It just has no stretch to it at all to the point of being uncomfortable. I'm returning it.
2.0,I understood that it ran small but figured going up a full size would make it too big(it would have). The padding was weird in the left slipper but didn't notice after 10 minutes. But I would need to have cut off the ends of my biggest toes for it to be comfortable. OK if sitting but not walking around. I stopped buying shoes online because even the same model wasn't always the same. Clearly slippers are now in the same way. I am returning these.
2.0,"They look nice, but the texture is rough and i feel like they don't stay clean. They actually needed to be turned throughout the day as they would ""stick""."
2.0,Tried them on. Not crazy about the material. I definitely prefer underarmour material. Wish I hadn't bought two of them. Considering returning them.
2.0,"I really wanted to like the product because this makes a great present.<br /><br />I bought three of these card holders. Orange one's clip broke after a couple months and the entire ID case fell, lime green one's card holder had a hole on arrival where the card would fall right out, and sky blue is still ok after a month of use. Things could've been awful if the person using one didn't notice it missing and lose their ID/credit cards."
2.0,long enough to be a dress
2.0,very poor quality ... I cant pull it off...
2.0,"I bought the 3 pack of purple, they were black. had to return bc i needed purple."
2.0,Hard to breathe through.
2.0,I should have ordered one size bigger.<br />Design is not as clear as image advertised.
2.0,These are twist on stud earrings the rubber bands were not sturdy and the earring screw part didn‚Äôt tightened this is the problem I believe for why the earring popped off. They need to make the screw part adjusted to were it tightens instead of being loosely twisted. The colors were nice but nothing I can do with one earring unless you want me to look like Prince lol
2.0,"These are probably fine as hairbands, they are worthless as sweatbands."
2.0,Not a big fan. Too tight. Should have returned when I had the chance. I was better off buying similar pants at my local Target so I could try them on.
2.0,"The shoulders were sooo puffed out, and the collar was too big (I bought a L; I'm 5'8&#34;, 145lbs). I wore it once and then it went into the Goodwill pile."
2.0,Very thin. Not very soft. Would not order again
2.0,"I ordered the plus size (12-24).  I wear size 16-18 leggings, but these are too small.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they are very soft as described.  Would have been happy with them if they had fit."
2.0,The top fits fine but really sad about how small the bottoms are. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7 and 170lbs so of course I have a little meat in me but most of it happens to be in my thighs and butt so looks like I‚Äôm going to have to order bottoms from another site that kinda match :/
2.0,The only problem I had was the size was misleading.  It should be stated somewhere in Big Bold letters that the sizes are not equivalent to US sizes.
2.0,"Shirt looks cute in the photos, but the fabric is very wrong. It has a sheen like exercise clothing. Would look strange with jeans or anything outside of running tights. Very disappointed."
2.0,"I really, really wanted this shirt to work. I love the message, the material, and the advertised look.<br />The shape of the shirt is so very strange, though.<br />I followed instructions from other buyers and ordered two sizes up. Generally, I wear women‚Äôs large. These are marked as slim, so I expected a fitted shirt‚Äîand by sizing up, I looked forward to the advantage of a longer length for layering.<br />What I received was like a husky children‚Äôs shirt. It was short (not crop top short, but not like any traditional adult shirt) and very, very wide.<br />It is soft, but in no way flattering.<br />After perusing the comments and sizing descriptions to make a choice, I‚Äôm really disappointed."
2.0,"Very thin and flimsy compared to the stock kens. Update after i put them in the frames...<br /> Well, they're in a pair of frames. Sloppy fit, move around constantly when you're cleaning them. Creak when you put them on or take them off. They are polarized, but don't seem so in bright sunlight, where there's glare across the entire lens.  I prefer a brown lens so I have no choice  but to use them.  I would NOT recommend."
2.0,Need to size 1 or 2 up.
2.0,The top was too big and the bottom were snug. If you have a booty good luck getting into the shorts. I really wanted them to work because the picture looks so cute but on they just look dorky
2.0,"I ordered the peachy colored dress. When it arrived I was shocked that there was red in the dress but no peach. I returned the dress and reordered it, thinking maybe there was a mistake. When the second one arrived it was the same colors! Not very happy that the pictures dress is not the same as the one I received. I love the cut and length but disappointed in the color."
2.0,"very thin material, not what I expected."
2.0,Cute but i wore it one time for a couple of hours and the heel broke off and the bottom for worn out so fast. I also felt unstable with them.
2.0,"The band is pretty, but for the life of me, I could not get the extra links out with the tool.  Maybe if they would send some better instructions instead of this small sheet with pictures.  Maybe do a youtube video.  I bought two of these things, a rose one and a silver one.  They look pretty, but why buy if you can't use it."
2.0,Cute but didn't last an hour before seems came undone
2.0,"Cheap. Cheaply made, poor quality. Don't bother. Buy something like this in person. Gauty!!"
2.0,"The actual shirt is soft and fits well, a bit big but I sized up, but the graphic is like a big sheet of plastic. It feels like it will peel off very easily and makes crinkling noises when you move. The picture quality is also lacking a bit."
2.0,"The color is not true to the pale pink color indicated in the picture. They are neon pink. The material is too thin and shows what you're wearing underneath. I'm not comfortable wearing them outside of my house for that reason. They are super comfortable though, so if you want pajama pants they'll work for you. However, as ""jogging "" pants they fall short."
2.0,They are huuuge
2.0,They were much smaller than anticipated.  It stated for Carnival Cruise but our tag was bigger and had to be cut down to fit.
2.0,"The truck prints look old, faded and pixelated. Was not worth the price."
2.0,Very thin. Not a great quality. Arms were q little tight.  I guess u get what u pay for at this price.
2.0,"did not work for me, bifocal seems to be located wrong or is wrong size  to be comfortable"
2.0,"This ear wrap looks really cool, but the problem with it is that it's hard to keep it on. The only support it has to stay on is a little ear cuff at the bottom. If you lean a little to the left, it just falls right off. You'd have to have really big, stiff ears for it to stay on. I might have to glue an earring post to it."
2.0,They run. Beyond small and I don‚Äôt liek material
2.0,"After reading reviews I ordered LG as I typically wear.  Received today, way too small, no stretch, not soft and cozy... ugh waited over a month to get to NY  from China.  When will I learn..."
2.0,"This necklace is beautiful and the shipping was so fast, however I have given this necklace 2 stars because there is no way to close the necklace therefore it just falls off."
2.0,"Cheaply made. Buttons are plastic with silver paint that is already chipping off. I'm afraid to wash this, it seems the stitches will be coming off after 1 or 2 washes. It is a pretty color and style though. I also think it runs true to size. I ordered L thinking it would be small but it is definitely too large for me, so I would suggest to order your normal size. I really wish the quality is better. I wouldn't pay more than a couple dollars for this shirt."
2.0,"I had hoped that these would be more like pants that my daughter could wear outside - but they are very much ""pajama quality"" in appearance and weight. Also, they fit HUGE. We had to send them back. Very long!"
2.0,Not the socks we expected. Too short is the biggest complaint.
2.0,"Product description says it is made of straw. Label in the hat, however, says ‚Äú100% PAPER‚Äù. Seriously?  So not a hat for anything other than costume/dress up. Definitely don‚Äôt get caught in the rain."
2.0,"Very disappointed! These glasses are HUGE!  You have to have a large, LARGE head for these these glasses to fit.  I bought these hoping I could wear them for jogging. NO WAY! The measurements are INCORRECT, they say they are 5.5 inches across.  The pair I recieved are over 6 inches across.  If you have a very large head, these are for you. If you have a average or small head, DO NOT BUY THESE GLASSES!"
2.0,The size chart was way off. This shirt was way too small
2.0,"Not crazy about these - usually I wear Spalding but thought I would give these a try...while the rear and upper thigh fit snugly, the fabric area around the knee is loose and a bit baggy giving a rather sloppy appearance rather than the streamlined look I prefer...I wouldn't buy this brand again."
2.0,about the pocket watches I bought sometime in sept.could not pass up that great price. bought 3. one  for me and the others for gifts. the guys that bought them before me was very lucky and I must be very unlucky every one had some kind of scratches +one had some kind  of slight deformity on the outside also.since I don't get out very often and have to use a walker I don't like going up to the post office to mail anything so I just kept them. as long as I'm talking I might as well say something else about them they don't seem to be as large as the ones I remember my dad and uncles had. when they would get together and show off by swinging  them around by the chains
2.0,"Won't buy again, not worth sending back."
2.0,Really thin and flimsy. Definitely a onetime use then throw away.
2.0,"It runs very small.  Also, the back of the jacket bunches up like it was sewn like that."
2.0,I love these!  The fabric is quite nice. I was disappointed with the snug fit initially but they stretch just enough to be snugly.  But they are sooo short!  Nothing like the photo.  I have F&J fleece pjs which I adore so ordered these. Just wish they were as advertised
2.0,"The flecktarn pattern here is way too bright. Almost like it wants to be a summer pattern, but it comes across like a bad Video game skin.<br />This face cover is more of a fashion statement than a functional bit of camo.<br />Much brighter than the item pictured in the item description.<br /><br />Otherwise, the fabric weight and construction is good. Shipping was fine."
2.0,Way to small it is more  like a  med
2.0,I returned this purse because it looked very cheap.
2.0,.Wanted  $200.00 for return an exchange . if you buy  go one size up than you would normaly wear
2.0,Looked great but not for anyone with a butt! Ripped with in a few hours of wearing them. I'm usually a small but these are not ideal for women with curves!
2.0,Not as good as it see
2.0,"This dress did not fit as expected. The tie at the top makes the gap too big. The dress itself was looser than expected, and the tie front just made it awkward. Maybe better for someone with a smaller chest size. I am 5‚Äô10‚Äù, a 36C and I ordered a large."
2.0,DEFINITELY SIZE UP
2.0,"The dresses are cute, I will have to take about an inch or two in bc of being slightly too big. I ordered three, however one of the zippers are already broken and she‚Äôs never worn it, just came like that..."
2.0,the quality is okay but too the size is too small not as mention on the size chart
2.0,"I can wear this but it is not as flattering as I hoped.  The under garment is very comfortable. However, the shear top layer felt like a bag. As you can see from the pictures, the pleats are off set and one pleat is missing. This made me feel crooked. I took pictures of under both arms so you can see one side is nice and covered and the other is wide and open. Again making me feel crooked/sideways.  Is anyone but me going to notice? I'm not sure."
2.0,I like the pants especially because I do not have to iron them. üëçüèº
2.0,Looks nothing like the pictures. The mouth and teeth are way oversized and the skin colors are way off.
2.0,"The watch was dead when I received it, and I've continued to receive automated emails thanking me for my purchase, though I've already been refunded for it."
2.0,Bought this set only because it said it was a messy bun beanie even the picture shows it but both came with no wholes so dissatisfied
2.0,"I wear a medium and bought a large after reading the description. The large is really snug which is disappointing when it says not to dry, aka this will shrink. So, this will be a one and done shirt. It is very cute and the material is soft. I just hate that it runs soooooo small."
2.0,"It's a little too sheer and the black ribbon accents do not fall as nicely as they do in the picture, which makes it a little difficult to wear. It's an interesting piece though."
2.0,Disappointed because the fit is great but completely see through
2.0,"Too small.  The picture showed it covers long over the back of the mannequin.  Not in reality.  The widest width measures only 12 inches + 2 inches of the lace.  So when it was draped over the back, it barely covers half of the back (and I wears size 6 petite).  The material is pretty, however, if I had known about the size, I wouldn't order it.  With this price, I wouldn't bother to send it back for a refund.  I also ordered a black one from a different vendor.  However, same size, too small.  Already left another review for the other vendor."
2.0,"The dress arrived in a plastic bag and smelled like chemicals. It makes me wonder how it was made and what sort of chemicals were used to manufacture the dress. I would not have purchased it had I known it would smell like that.<br /><br />I liked the fit, but the fabric and color were strange. The top part of the dress and the bottom flare part are made from two different fabrics with two different colors. It is just not worth the cost. I could have found something nicer for the same amount.<br /><br />I wanted to return the dress, and I suppose I could have had I had the time. However, it was a bit more difficult to do so because I had to print a label and ship it back to the company. I had not realized this when I purchased it. It is easier to return things at Kohls, but I could not do that for this item and did not realize it. I was too busy to take it to the UPS store or USPS, not sure which it would have been. So, I wasted my money and will send it to the Goodwill."
2.0,"I ordered 2 sizes larger (per ad) and still too small. Went to re-order but out of stock..,"
2.0,One broke instantly. The other has worn out beads on it. I only wear them during the day but they are tearing up and wearing out easily. I‚Äôm not impressed.
2.0,Beautiful top and ordered  my normal size &#34; it was too snug on me and it showed every bkiump.
2.0,Fit is way too big and not enough stretch.
2.0,It looked good on amazon but the size was just not correct fit for me. Did not like the material.
2.0,"I was so excited for these JOGGERS‚Ä¶ except they are literally LEGGINGS. The sizing is not in US sizing either. I ordered an XXL and received an XL in US sizing. They would be cute if I wanted a new pair of leggings, but I needed joggers for work and these don‚Äôt cut it."
2.0,This broke within an hour of having it. Cheaply made. Don‚Äôt recommend.
2.0,"Didn‚Äôt really look like Joe Burrow. The person they were purchased for, was not impressed."
2.0,"This is not what is shown in the picture. Not grey more steal blue color. Not a sweat shirt either, it‚Äôs more like a thick long sleeve kinda like athletic material. Still cute but not what I ordered!"
2.0,I ordered a size bigger than i normally wear and it was still a bit too tight.
2.0,"It should be stated that these are not American sizes.  They are foreign sizes that run way to small.  I did talk to the company and got a little bit of a refund cause said it would cost to much to send back to China.  I learned my lesson, won't be doing this again.  Also, was not t-shirt material more like a spandex - yuck."
2.0,"Not as pictured, colors were off and mask were scratchy and smelled funny."
2.0,A better diagram of the product would have been more prevalent up against a small item of that size to give an idea how big item w
2.0,"I loved the look of this top online, but when it came, it was odd. The top is big enough around, but the ruffle on the bottom starts right at my waist and looks very boxy. The ruffles on the sleeves are well above my elbows. Ordering a larger size would not have fixed this issue. I will still likely wear the top, but it isn't what I expected from the pic."
2.0,This is extremely small !!!!!! dont worth the money !
2.0,Sizes are completely weong
2.0,I am 5'4 at 160lbs and this Zhongli outfit wasn't a good fit for me even though I got this as an X-large. They didn't have another one in XX size before our con. The pants did not fit me at all so I had to just wear regular black business pants instead. The collar shirt top and bottom parts keeps sticking out of the coat and pants. The shoulder pads with Velcro's were the most difficult parts to keep in place. I had to use multiple fabric tape and it still sticks out like a sore thumb. My long pony tail wig kept getting caught and tangled at the butt of the back coat where his vision was. The gold pieces were just stickers stuck to some foams on the coat. So you have to carefully wash by hand and steam dry it. This was a total train wreck unfortunately.
2.0,"I‚Äôve purchased several of these type of waist trainers. The issue with this one is that there is a Velcro for the inside and out side. So when you initially put it on you have to match the Velcro up to stay in place so that you can wrap it around. How ever for me the Velcro did not line up as it didn‚Äôt offer enough room between the two, to fully wrap around my stomach. This causes the inside Velcro to be itchy and dig into my skin. No way it could be work to work out or for more than 2 minutes. It‚Äôs useless for me personally."
2.0,Love the color it was super bad maybe just not good enough for me both zippers broke on me within a month $49 gone. I really needed this for school it wasn't super packed either.
2.0,My waist is average and the belt kept sliding down to my hips.
2.0,If you‚Äôre a normally a size Large! Get the size 2XL runs size! The material runs small.
2.0,looks all shiny and dazzly. definitely not for me.<br />but what did I expect. after all it is satin.
2.0,"So back at Christmas time my boyfriend bought this shirt for me in a medium and it was like I painted it on. So, I went and bought it in a large and it is way to big. I'm the same size as in December and the other shirt is still to tight."
2.0,Sized very small.
2.0,I give it a 2 star because they are beautiful. But I received my bracelet yesterday and wore it today and within 4 hours it broke. So unfortunately I am returning
2.0,Too short  -  Nice print  -  Not cotton (It is probably polyester w/stretch
2.0,"Cheap plastic, like from the dollar store."
2.0,"This bag was great initially. Plenty of room and pockets for organization. Seemed well made. However the zipper broke after using for two weeks, 3x a weeks."
2.0,These are so large! They are probably 3 sizes larger than normal shoes! They seem like they may be well made but maybe for next year......
2.0,Cheap material. Quite see-through.Discolors fast. But very soft and comfy for normal wear
2.0,I haven't had the coat a week yet and the stuffing already begun to come out.
2.0,I returned these neck gaiters as they were too tied and uncomfortable. Very small.
2.0,"I'm 6&#34;2&#34;, and I purchased the loop style, it was too short. It unleashed as soon as I stood up. It might be great for short people, but I really don't care. You're welcome short people, you won again. Congratulations. Lets give it up for the short people. This product is making me resent short people, and I don't like that. I love women. I was talking to my phycologist, which is what I call my mirror, because I'm an adult and could handle myself, and he (me) said that just be cool and give it a two star instead of one. I, of course asked why, and he (me) said because short people could definitely use this product. I agreed, because women can use this product and be happy. You're welcome."
2.0,"No chest support at all! Back is basically a thong, which was as the picture showed but the top is not flattering at all if you have a larger chest."
2.0,"The material is horrible. I ended up returning it. It‚Äôs cute, but the material is a scratchy type material. The type that if you rub up against something you‚Äôll end up with fuzz balls stuck to it."
2.0,"It may be because I'm more petite, but the sizing did not accomodate my pregnancy belly... super bummed, but I guess I saved some money."
2.0,It's very beautiful but not even close to the sizing chart. Way too small!
2.0,The joggers fit good nice and stretchy but the hoodies fits small.
2.0,"Ugh, didn't like to waistband. Cheap, you get what you pay for."
2.0,Looks very cheap. Quality is not there. and these clothes run way too small.
2.0,The charms are pretty but you can see the discoloration in the bracelet. Also it doesn‚Äôt unscrew either. I was going to give this to my mother for her bday but yeah no. Waste of money tbh
2.0,Too long the boobs are extra big I am sure it makes me look fat
2.0,"Order a size up and also know that it is a serious catch all! (Lint, hair and everything)"
2.0,Very low quality leather. The bad disintegrated and broke in only a couple months.
2.0,Like the look but not big enough.
2.0,"was a little smaller than expected, and the belt was way too small."
2.0,How can you mess up a basic tank?  This one gaps at the arm holes and hangs oddly.  The material is thin with no body.  I guess Supima is NOT the same as Pima cotton.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I sent it back even though I had to pay return shipping.
2.0,"Not bad, Extremely big even on me, I'm a size 16 and i have to go behind and then tie it in the front. There are 4 pockets not 3. Found some really uneven stitching, but that can happen with anything you buy and it's not something I cant fix. Overall, I give this 3 stars mainly because it is not worth almost $11 (before S&H). I think this would be perfect for like elementary or art teachers who carry things on them for class, but We'll see how it holds up waiting tables this week.<br /><br />***Updated***<br />Used it waiting tables for a week and its has almost completely come apart, I had to get the sewing machine out, take it completely apart with a seam ripped, and sew it back together!! Keep in mind I only wait tables for about 2-3 hours a day 5 days a week so its not like i'm doing it all day a d the only thing the apron is used for is to hold my ticket book and tips. I do not recommend this for gratuitous usage. Which is sad because it is cute. But i need function over fashion and this didnt make the cut."
2.0,"The shoes are beautiful, but for the price the vast variances in size makes them worth a pass over item. I'm disappointed. I purchased them for my daughter and the size is way off. I wish I would have looked into the reviews first. Judging from the vast differences‚Äã, I would have definitely gone with a different shoe all together. Which is sad, because they are beautiful."
2.0,This leather necklace broke just after a few days if wear. :(
2.0,"Although the picture shows the waist is at the natural waist, the elastic really was up across my rib cage which made the dress very unflattering. The waist was definitely not as pictured."
2.0,"I just got this ring in the mail. Its a little thin, and feels pretty cheap. The gem in the middle is also missing, and the middle where it should sit is damaged. The gem is not in the package it came in which means it was broken before they sent it."
2.0,"XL is like a bandaid, covers just the minimum."
2.0,I ordered this for ‚Äúrockstar‚Äù day at work and it showed up two days later than amazon had said originally (which most of my packages have been delayed lately). At first I was bummed but when the package arrived I was glad it did because I would have kept a shirt that is disappointing. The lips are orange and feel like plastic on there - not a screen print feel. Maybe it is just my preference but this just isn‚Äôt worth me keeping - even if it is only $15.
2.0,"a little long, but I like it loose.  disappointed that the soles were so thin they provided no insulation against cold tiles.  and it lacked a rear door so it is a struggle in the toilet."
2.0,It‚Äôs cut small and looks very inexpensive made
2.0,"Hat is small onsie is YUGE and pants are over-sized as is the style. Weird outfit, size-wise."
2.0,Fabric is thin and shows every lump or roll. I  won't be able to wear it
2.0,"Received them intime, they look close to pictures, received them with missing CZ's.. It was a bummer."
2.0,"As of titled, the sticking part will crease up and show through"
2.0,Did not fit snug.I have this shirt in the mixed fabric I think with a type of spandex and it looks great.One size down from your regular size and that should help.
2.0,"I wanted to love this leotard. The adorable lacey bow cut out on the back is adorable and dresses up what would be a very basic leotard. But unfortunately the same cannot be said about lace detail on the front of the leotard. My daughter is shorter than average with a very athletic build and the leotard fit her body and shape just fine, but the front lace is far too revealing. She tried the leo on when she received it and it did not look too risqu√© but after moving around in class the lace fully revealed her chest. It would have been awesome if the lace detail laid on top of the leo fabric and wasn‚Äôt just see through lace, as it is on the back of the leo. The leotard seems to be well made and with good materials so I still give it a two star rating, but I would not recommend it."
2.0,"Bought it for my wife and the zipper was really weak and broke, would return it but it's not worth the cost."
2.0,"To small for lip hurt even going in. I do wear 16 g. Could use for earring, if bought two. But I don't know if it's worth it."
2.0,"Used it for a halloween gig. Due to cheap wiring, it was twisted and hell-bent in all sorts of ways, but I still made it work. It's fine for a one evening halloween party, but don't expect to use it more than one."
2.0,"Have no idea about the quality.  Seemed to look alright, but who knows.  Nevertheless, they were tiny.  If you order these (beware, they are sold under numerous brand names on Amazon), you need to order a couple of sizes up.  Moreover, you have to pay for mailing to China to return these, which will cost you about 12 dollars.  Good luck!"
2.0,"This pendant is large and sparkly, but not in a good way.  It is cheap looking.  I will only wear it for St. Patrick's Day."
2.0,"This bag arrived without any &#34;stuffing&#34; to help retain shape. It was folded in half leaving a crease. The handles are very stiff and don't hang flat when using the optional shoulder strap. I chose this bag because of the sale and because it can be worn cross body, but the handles make that uncomfortable. It's definitely not worth the full price shown of $89.99. I think I'll be returning this bag."
2.0,"The dress does not look like the picture. It is made of a shiny, streatchy material and looks cheap."
2.0,"it looks nice on-line but is ill fitting, I gopt this two times larger and still the dress is tight"
2.0,So it's comfortable but doesn't hold up my pistol didn't come with the extra clips which I was expecting definitely smaller than advertised if you wear a 42 or bigger get a different belt they fit me at 40 but barely
2.0,"Some of these are defective due to the stitching being so tightly applied that when these shorts are washed, the stitching tares into the fabric during the wash cycle"
2.0,"Bought 8/2020 and used 2-3 hours a week. Hole formed at  ankle level - see pic.<br />I had Pearl Izumi socks that lasted years, not months like these. I still have the other two pair that are functional."
2.0,Not impressed. I got a lovely cut gemstone. However its flawed it two places and i think i got a smaller stone than what i bought... Was supposed to get 70.5 carats was more like fiftyish
2.0,Waste of money unfortunately.  They were way too big and wide.  The colors and design was cute but so cheap looking.
2.0,Very thin so your going to want to bunch it up.
2.0,"Wanted to love but when tried on, it just looks cheap and dowdy. Material is not flattering as it enhances any bump/pooch one might have. Returning."
2.0,"Wrong size, it was a 20mm not 22mm. Otherwise it looked fine."
2.0,Don't stay in place
2.0,comfy and cute but the first pair i put on immediately started to fall apart. The lace became detached from the rest of the panties in places and now they look ratty. Even if the lace hadn't detached at the seams it looks as though if would've frayed in the wash anyways!<br /><br />very bummed these didn't work out because I got the right size and theyre very cute. I think I'll continue to buy them for target for slightly more money but better quality
2.0,This item is not what I expected. I will return it for a refund.
2.0,The band is nice but the color was pink not purple.
2.0,Received these today...only one has a backing. Looks like they were worn before and the earrings are larger than the box they were in. Cheaply made. Don‚Äôt buy them! You will be disappointed as I am!
2.0,"It was pretty disappointing.<br />This material looks like recycled plastic mixed with cotton.  The sizing is fine (if you know your size and think &#34;chinese sizes&#34;;<br /><br />Over all. I'd buy the Arrow brand next time. I was tossing between the two and regret purchasing this shirt. Its not very non wrinkly. It arrives in a compressed plastic wrinkly bag, and Idk. Its nice looking when you wear it. But I really just overall didn't like the material. It would be nice on a sunny day? But Living in Tacoma WA. Where it rains everyday this shirt and material is just too unpractical. I just was thinking This is the same material mc donalds uses on their work uniforms (or even worse quality). The tailoring is really nice. But if your not into wearing the equivalent of wearing a fine tailored recycled garbage bag. Move on, and save your money!"
2.0,The watch band would not fit; I don't have a large men's wrist.
2.0,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO PICTURE
2.0,when i can  fit into it I'll let you know
2.0,"The design was adorable but quality was so poor, once washed, it looked worn out and became very stretched, too loose."
2.0,"Love the charm, however the chain broke in the first 24 hours. Very cheap!"
2.0,"This bracelet is quite good looking and matches almost any dressing of mine. The size fit my perfectly.<br /><br />Sadly, the leather area close to the clasp began peeling/bruising after just about a month of wear, making the black area dull and grey. I even applied black polish once to get the shine back but after working at my desk with hands on the table, just writing or typing, the bruising resume- and my tabletop isn't rough. This leather here isn't the best. Maybe add a little more cash for a more durable bracelet if you intend to wear this very often."
2.0,"Very inexpensive looking but then, they are very inexpensive."
2.0,"The size small was too loose and roomy for my taste. I was disappointed that it didn't fit as I had hoped. If you're someone who is petite or looking for a more fitted look, I would recommend going a size down or considering a different style."
2.0,"El art√≠culo es de buena calidad , pero queda demasiado suelto en tu oreja parece  que  se va a caer .. si te gusta el arete pegado en tu oreja üëÇ.. estos aretes no son para ti .. queda demasiado suelto ..los devolver√© .."
2.0,Not a sweater more of a very light blazer did not fit sizes run amall
2.0,Battery was dead
2.0,"I have such mixed feelings a out these shoes. They are amazing looking in person. The picture doesn't do them justice. I absolutely am 100% disappointed  in the comfort department. It has such a thick heel that I believed would provide awesome support and comfort, no matter what the activity. It has a very stiff feel to them in the heel with no provided shock protection with any activities involving running, or jumping. Basic walking for a couple hours at a time, is all I can imagine using  this shoe for."
2.0,Ridiculously hard to unscrew! I spent a good 20 minutes trying a variety of them and couldn't get the ball off the bar. Extremely frustrating.
2.0,I thought this dress was very pretty! But it was really big on the top. I usually wear a size M but would have needed a size S. I returned it rather than exchanging it. I recommend going down a size. Good quality though!
2.0,I ordered this for my granddaughter and when she received the package today the package was empty .. there was no damage to package . It was just a empty package mailed ..
2.0,I look like a large puff of carpet fiber.
2.0,Is ok but there has and still is a weird odor that lingers in it. Washed it multiple times and it just won‚Äôt fade away. Stopped using it and just have it for decoration now because of the smell. Great material just the smell is off.
2.0,"Cheaply made, way smaller than pictured. Plus, the ring is TINY. Yes, it is able to be made bigger, but then it leaves a huge gap on the underside of the ring. I guess you get what you pay for and since this jewelry is so cheap, maybe I should have had lower expectations. I just like getting what is pictured!"
2.0,Seller- MedVetInternational- XL were snug- more like L. The elastic tops caused my legs to break out. They were going to charge me restocking fee and I would have to pay my own return shipping- equally twice as much as the product!
2.0,"For one the chain is way way thinner then it looks in the picture, not the mention the ankh is a lot smaller then it looks"
2.0,"It fit fine but was way longer than I expected and fit strange, I don't know how to describe it. It just didn't look quite right. I even tried to get it altered because I wanted it to look good so bad but it just didn't work."
2.0,It is not black on both sides so it flashes white on the underside when you move in it.
2.0,It shank when I washed it üòû
2.0,My thighs said this is not going to work
2.0,"Shorts are very cute. However, he wears a size 6. We ordered a 5 and they were huge on him. Returned those and ordered a 4 and those are still huge."
2.0,Only received 1 not 2 in package.
2.0,"The size difference between 1 and 2x are ridiculous. And not in a good way.  The green one is so short.  The blue one has great length but the cut is not at all like the pictures.  Very disappointed.  Material is thick and sturdy, but the cut just bugs me.  It's more like a standard tank."
2.0,This thing is slim fit to the max. They need to make that a little more clear.
2.0,The arm sleeves are basically panty hoses for your arms.<br />The shawls are better so maybe they actually protect from the sun. Because I don't believe for a second the sleeves do.
2.0,Left a film on my credit cards.
2.0,"Not nearly as nice as the picture looks. This top has a very odd fit, hard to describe, but it just did not feel comfortable even though the size was correct. Return are the customers responsibility and must be sent to India, so basically not worth it. Very disappointing."
2.0,Ripped on the collar already.
2.0,they are cute. but really hard to get on by yourself.
2.0,"Purchased for my wife to use when skiing on colder days. She always has cold feet. She liked them at first but after an hour or two, she said the wires under her foot became uncomfortable.<br /><br />Battery position maybe at risk of falling out if you fall while skiing<br /><br />Looking for heated boots"
2.0,I love the item but the bracelet broke after wearing it twice.  I wouldn't recommend this item to others.
2.0,Bought as a gift for my father in law but I am noticing tonight (Christmas Eve  unfortunately) that the screenprint is not centered. My fault for not inspecting closer before now but disappointed that I cannot give it to him tomorrow.
2.0,"The size is perfect. Middle zippered pocket is unattainable wen on shoulder, pocket for cell phone is really shallow and will not hold my Samsung Galaxy s9, there's no dropping one strap off shoulder to gain excess to inside of purse, and finally the smell is so bad.......I had to put charcoal inside for 3 days b4 I could even use it.  I feel like if ya'll know it is smelly then y don't ya'll put sum charcoal packets b4 shipping!?!?!?1"
2.0,"I returned this item as it was not to my expectations - the fabric was not smooth and felt odd, it fell awkwardly - I could have made it work if the fabric was more appealing. I have other items of this blend and they are not an issue. The fit could just be due to my body style - I think it would work on someone else, just not for me."
2.0,Fell apart.  Looked nice but fell apart.
2.0,I wore it about 4 times before 2 fingers broke off. I tried too fix it but the prices snapped. Do not recommend!
2.0,"I don't know what i thought i was ordering, i actually laughed when i opened up the box and seen these. They look like leggings that have jeans printed on them, they look horrible. I wore them under a casual sweater dress and once i put them on they looked better then just holding them up. But they kept riding down as i walked. So not only are they ugly, they are uncomfortable too!"
2.0,Very loose... it doesn't snap close.
2.0,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù, 210 lbs. I bought 3 XL‚Äôs. All of them fit well in the chest and shoulders, but the length is too short. One of them is cut crookedly and will be replaced.<br />They‚Äôre nice with the ironed in reflectors, but considering the quality of the (short) cut and the one that is ‚Äúcrooked‚Äù on me, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth the price."
2.0,Weird material.  Looks cheaply made.
2.0,The dress was very low cut and was not at all the way I was hoping.
2.0,"They are cute, they run small, and the lace is super itchy on me so I‚Äôm returning"
2.0,"Mask was super cute put it didn‚Äôt fit me, but it fits my daughter very well."
2.0,It's not the coffee I ordered...it was a khaki color...and definitely not cotton
2.0,The arms are a bit tighttight for the size
2.0,The colors are super pastel! It was so hard to even tell these are unicorns. Would‚Äôve loved the color to have been much more vibrant!
2.0,I ordered an xl according to the size guide.  I'm a size 12 but should have ordered a large instead.  It's too big in the arms.
2.0,"Very cheap, no spring hinges, mirror coating was weak, couple of pairs came bent.  This is a step below gas station sunglasses, this is flea market level sunglasses.  Great or an emergency pair for the car or something, when you don't care if they get destroyed.  For the price, you get what you pay for on this one."
2.0,Nice colors cheaply synthetic material .. no great I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again
2.0,"I bought this backpack purse on October 22, just two months ago. I loved it and received many compliments on it. However, I noticed this weekend the wear you can see in the photograph. The quality of this bag is clearly poor. I am deeply disappointed."
2.0,"I generally wear a 1X, possibly a 2X if I want it blousy. This definitely runs smaller than expected."
2.0,"Product as described. Beautiful, but stopped working after one year."
2.0,"The tail is so large and heavy that it just kind of sags down when it's pinned on. It served its purpose, but I wasn't very impressed."
2.0,Quality of fabric was not what I expected.
2.0,"The item does not look like the picture. Looks cheaply made, and was mailed in a small package folded in half. When you fold metal it does not bend back correctly."
2.0,We were missing multiple numbers in the run definitely will not be buying these again
2.0,"Look and feel awesome. But dont put them in direct sunlight, paint peals off the frame and sticks on your face."
2.0,"When you order cheap bands, you expect cheap bands.<br /><br />These are really bad, though. After putting each one on only once, they start showing signs of wear -- that bacon edge kind of stippling that comes after slightly stretching cheap elastic. After a few days of wear they start showing fraying and some slight pilling.<br /><br />The bands themselves are comfortable and easy to adjust, they're just fragile and won't last a decent amount of time."
2.0,I order a size 20 and it was still too small.  It was also tight in the sleeves.  This cardigan fits more like a junior/miss instead of plus size.  Cute color though
2.0,These are not big enough for most adult men's hat.
2.0,I am very disappointed in these boots. The quality of these boots are very cheap. They even look cheap. They almost look like you are wearing a cheap plastic boot. The only good thing about this boot is they fit well and are true to size.
2.0,"I know you can't expect MUCH from these light up things.. It's more of a toy than jewelry<br /><br />But.. the batteries just light up from it jiggling, shaking, bumping into it, it's a constant struggle to keep it on AND off"
2.0,Poorly cut. The &#34;V&#34; neck is not centered.
2.0,"I enjoyed certain features of the luggage and had high hopes for it but I was disappointed after one international trip. I received the luggage set two days before a recent overseas trip.  I took the large suit case and the small one.  While the pocket on the small case was extremely convenient, it did absorb more of the internal space of the suitcase than I would have preferred. I was only able to put 2 shirts and a pair of shorts on that side of the luggage. I was not satisfied at all with the large suitcase. When I arrived at my destination and recovered the suit case from the airport luggage claim, I noticed that it didn't pull smoothly any longer.  After inspecting the suitcase, I noticed that the shell around two of the four wheels were cracked.  One of them was cracked to the point that the wheel would be pushed into the suitcase as any type of weight was applied.  I had to acquire a roll of duct tape and apply a make shift repair to areas around both wheels in order to ensure the suit case would with stand the flight home. My personal opinion is the suit case's shell is not durable enough to withstand the delicate touch of the airport luggage handlers."
2.0,The sizing is good way off and material have no elasticity. The material is very thick and would take long time too dry
2.0,I ordered an XXL which is one size up from what I usually wear and this was still way too small. I couldn't even get it over my head. Disappointing.
2.0,"This was the 3rd pair purchased although the first 2 were purchased at a different source.  The front snowflake on this pair fell off on the 2nd wear.  Very disappointing.<br />Update:  the pair was replaced and the same issue occurred within one day, same right foot slipper.  The other 2 pair are each 2 years old with no issues.  I will be gluing on this snowflake (instead of original stitching) but advise against purchase."
2.0,"This dress reminded me of a hospital gown, except that it wraps around the front instead of the back. It was a size smaller than expected also. The fabric is 100% polyester, as indicated in the description, but it isn't a nice, soft polyester. It has kind of a very plastic, almost vinyl, feel to it. It looks like something I would pay $5 for at a discount store. I would be embarrassed to wear it in public."
2.0,Not color shown. Had to return. Not happy
2.0,Was cute. Ordered a size up size my daughter is tall and it is still too snug. Pen markings can be seen and the seams are loose. It is not the greatest quality but she can wear it for dress up instead of dance class. Will not buy again.
2.0,Only the top arrived and not the leggings. üòí
2.0,"These pajamas were cute, but the fit was way off.  The size was okay, but the cut was such that it pulled through the crotch area.  I returned mine."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:607db9082d60c2044bc700bfa1d18526]] Earrings are pretty at first, but not size Pearl I was hoping they would be. ‚ÄîI nearly considered them until I looked closer and the wire hook and ball at bottom are tarnished and not ‚Äúgold‚Äù appearing at all to match the hoop.  In the photos of the advertising image, this wire and ball end are gold-looking and evenly match their respective hoops.  Thus, I will be returning these earrings.  Sigh üòû"
2.0,This was to small for my watch!
2.0,"The fabric is not good for sleeping<br />The few times I wore the night gown, I woke up in the middle of the night really warm and sweaty"
2.0,It is smaller than I thought. They must have used a special small mannequin to make it look larger. I also missed the part where it said the turquoise was treated and colored enhanced. I wouldn't buy again. I think $10 bucks is what it is worth.
2.0,"It comes with really nice packaging, card, and matching gift bag...however I think those are to hide the poor quality of the necklace."
2.0,It is truly a piece of junk. It changes color and stains your finger. Truly a shame because the letters and design are beautiful.
2.0,Too small for a man ring.
2.0,Very hard sole and got blisters after first use.
2.0,They were very well made but these ran on the small side.
2.0,wore them twice and top band is already starting to unravel
2.0,"Looks great, super yhins, and very wide on the face. Keeps falling off all the time"
2.0,"Doesn't cover the face as well as it should. Looks like a mask. Not comfortable. Itchy.  If it doesn't fit right, you have it on upside down.<br />Bad purchase. I'm ok with them since I lost a couple on vacation."
2.0,"Returned. Really cheap and hard material, not sure if it is leather. Poorly made."
2.0,"Amazon‚Äôs needs to widen their selection, the sleeves are not long enough ‚Ä¶ too short.<br /><br />Amazon sent me the wrong pattern."
2.0,Just didn‚Äôt have a screen protector so sent it back and ordered something different
2.0,These are very cute but the picture is deceiving. They are much smaller than they look. The top barely went past my second piercing and the stones are small as well. I also felt the backs were very hard to stay in place. The earring kept falling. I should have looked at the reviews first to see the photos others posted. It is my fault. I ended up returning them.
2.0,not the same color as on pic very dark color maybe dark brown they have army on front this is a reorder not at all what I got the first time
2.0,"I should have listened to the other review in which the person said the purse was more orange than brown. It's straight up orange. When comparing to my cognac boots, it wasn't even close. Otherwise, the bag seemed like it would work perfectly for me and the brand seems to be making a good reputation with its quality."
2.0,"I purchased as a cosmfine piece for work, and it will do. The ring is pretty, but the stone is definitely not Ruby colored. It‚Äôs much more of an Orange. I was really disappointed."
2.0,Great product ruined by a s strap that breaks. This is my 3rd pair
2.0,"Cheap material, did not look like in the photos."
2.0,This thing is seriously tiny. I realize that dance items are often like ninja suits but this thing is hilariously small lol.<br /><br />It seems like the arms might be stretchy enough to fit as perhaps a 3/4 sleeve which would be ok but the cuffs have no stretch and would doubtfully for over our 9year olds hand lol.<br /><br />I ordered the 7-10 year old size. My stepdaughter typically wears 10/12 size at Walmart but it fits loosely. Generally when something has an age range like this it fits her perfectly lol.
2.0,The material is not sweater like material . It's more shiny with a weave pattern.
2.0,They are big when using as septum jewelry
2.0,"I liked it but ordered my size xl and was too small, tight all over.  liked the color navy blue."
2.0,It was definitely cheaply made. Had strings all over inside and out we had to cut from not being sewn right. Does keep my little guy warm when we go outside though. Did not ask for a refund because we ordered it before it was needed so we put it up without really looking it over.<br /><br />Strongly suggest checking it right away.
2.0,"Super cute but, hurts like hell!"
2.0,"Fit great at waist, length was good. Chest was too big. I'm 5'6&#34; 130 pounds, but dont have a 38D cup"
2.0,"This suit runs small. The &#34;large&#34; fits like a medium, no kidding. The top has delicate not very supportive straps. Yes, there's underwire, but the straps need to be thicker, wider, more supportive. Disappointing sizing, like I said."
2.0,Too small. My mom who wears a size medium looks great in it.
2.0,While they were nice looking glasses both glasses broke on first use. One pair lost a hinge screw when the screw seat cracked. Could not be fixed. Second pair lost the screw entirely. Gave up on them. Did not see in description that these were disposable glasses after one use. Will not buy again.
2.0,They are a bit snug on my legs and are not very comfortable for my leg hair. It also doesn't have an opening in the front. All men's underwear should have a seam in the front! Length is good.
2.0,This top photographs well
2.0,"This hat is about as you would expect for the price. Mine has a little hole starting in the top already... It came rolled up in a rubber band in a plastic band. No Gellwhu tag or Gellwhu packaging as promised on the website, so I'm not sure how authentic it is."
2.0,Works fine but  came without instructions which seems odd<br />and where do order replacement material ?
2.0,"Fabric seems good quality for all but pants and cloak. Top fits but leather work fits a little off around the neck.  As you can see, can‚Äôt wear or put together girdle because no Velcro on the second main piece, on either side. Pants are really small and seem very cheap material compared to rest of it. Headpiece is smallish and elastic will need to be slightly stretched to make comfortable. Not sure I can wear this and work in it all day. Not sure I would want to wear even for a party."
2.0,"Comfortable and anti fog, but can't see anything underwater.  These aren't compensated for underwater.  Perfectly clear above water but won't be able to see a watch or details on the bottom of the pool."
2.0,"Colors were pale, I will try purchasing charms for my pandora again from amazon,  they all can't be bad.  Stay tune"
2.0,Very long sleeves and tight straight body
2.0,Itchy and fits very small. Not really worth the buy.
2.0,Nice pants but way too big. Even the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is too big for me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 160lbs.
2.0,Weird fabric that wrinkles easily and feels like it would melt if you tried to iron it. The sleeves are cute but the body of the shirt is just one big boxy square that has no shape to it...not figure flattering. The high neckline also adds to the awkwardness of this shirt. Returning ASAP
2.0,[[VIDEOID:8be582f776335698cbb56737261bb293]] It is like a sticker and just peeled off on part after only a couple weeks. Not worth it and wish i could have my money back.
2.0,Poor quality - runs very small
2.0,"not good, the colour came off the lens"
2.0,Everything started tearing apart at the bottom after 1 week.
2.0,"Waterproof, but flimsy material that didn't last very long. The pants ripped after just a few uses."
2.0,"BEWARE!! DIFFERENT COLORS ARE MADE DIFFERENTLY! I bought the white version, which is all stretch material and looks amazing, so I came back and bought this one. I was very surprised when it arrived! I't s a bright blue color (nothing like the pic) and is made of a non-stretch material with a very different sleeve design. Not happy with it. Since it wasn't stretch it didn't fit well. I love my white one, but returned this blue one! Look at the pictures carefully. The fuller sleeves like in this picture mean they are non-stretch."
2.0,"It was a really cute purse but the handles started fraying and falling apart within a month of having it. Too bad, the rest of it is really nice."
2.0,"The blouse was short more than anything else, the fabric was very thin and not luxurious as I expected."
2.0,"Not cotton material like the picture,kind of shiny material"
2.0,"The ring does look like the picture which is the only plus.  However, the ring is HUGE and not adjustable since it's adjusted / tightened end to end.  Also the metal looks weathered and abused on the backside.  I will not be able to use this ring for my own healing  and cannot gift it because unfortunately it looks used and just not of any high end quality."
2.0,Too small and does not retain water very long.
2.0,"Bought these for my 6 year old. The guage seems too big. I thought they were stainless steel but they seem plastic. Gems don't screw on well and ended up losing one of them the first time I put them in. However, she has had them in for about 3 months and has not had any irritation that she normally gets if bad metal, so I guess they're ok."
2.0,"These were purchased in a Medium size but what was received was 3 different sizes. The grey pair was the smallest, black was medium, and the red pair was the largest."
2.0,"My wife uses them to keep the wind from her ears, unfortunately these did not even cover her ears."
2.0,Not Cotton Jersey Material
2.0,First time I wore the belt the woven elastic material came apart.
2.0,"Not true to size, and see through"
2.0,The neck is really high compared to the picture. It had adjustable straps but still really high
2.0,You can maybe use a collar extender once and then its pretty much worthless.
2.0,Pretty color but the fabric is thin and clingy and overall it looks cheap to me.
2.0,The idea is okay but the image is small.  The clip is so flexible that when the tie is adjusted a cord frequently slips out of the clip.  The clip is so flexible it will not hold.  So cheap it's not worth the effort to send back.
2.0,"This case fit on the watch well, however it had a clear plastic that cover the screen area that had surface scratches when it arrived.  I found another model without a screen cover which i currently use."
2.0,Save your money. Looks like a slip. Very thin and see through. Returning as soon as possible.
2.0,"It fit well to my body type, but was a very thin & poor material. It felt like I was wearing a costume. 2 stars is being nice lol. Wouldn't recommend."
2.0,"Kind of 80's...very thin.  Not worth the bucks, even though it was cheap."
2.0,"These were HUGE. I have no idea what I thought they would be like, but the metal was cheap and they were way to big for me to wear. Maybe that's for some people, but I thought they looked very cheap."
2.0,"No es como se v√© en la foto, muy feo."
2.0,Too long and easily breaks
2.0,Spend $15 on a watch from Steinmart. Don't waste your time or money with this crud.
2.0,"Very comfy material and I like the colors. However, it shrank a lot the first time I washed it and now it is too small. Be sure to order a size up. And the pockets are located right on the outside of the hip and poof out in a very unflattering way. Doesn't stay closed unless you use the inside tie, which makes for an even more unflattering fit."
2.0,I was hoping this would fit nicely to give me protection when in a Covid patient room. They don‚Äôt work well with an N 95 mask. There was a downward pressure/pull on my eyes. Maybe because I wear contacts this made it extremely uncomfortable. They fog up easily but that was remedied using anti-fog solution.<br />Luckily I wear these at most 1.5 hours. My hats off to emergency and ICU room staff who wear these all day!!
2.0,Se ve√≠a bien hasta que se puso amarillo.
2.0,"I like these tights. However the run REALLY small. I bought them for Halloween for my 10 and 11 year olds, but neither could fit them. Unfortunately I have to return them. üò©"
2.0,My daughter like the design of the shoe and was excited to wear them. After two days the decorative rubber on the outside pealed off. She is three and not is active as a six year old. I have seen other shoes last longer then a then a week with active rough playing boys. She did not pick on the rubber design at all. The shoes has fit good for her so far but unsure how long they will last d/t the poor quality of the material used.
2.0,I stopped using them when I found out that they scratched my eyeglasses from rubbing against the lenses
2.0,Way too tight at the waist
2.0,"Very tight at shoulders, sleeves too narrow and length shorter than desired. Returned."
2.0,"The actual socks are very thick and quality. However, the sizing was WAY off. I ordered a 4/6 and they would fit a 10 year old."
2.0,I did not like the overall product. I‚Äôm 5‚Äù4 170lbs and ordered a large. It fit snug but not too tight and that‚Äôs how I wanted it. I got it for a postpartum girdle and thought it did the purpose. I had a 3rd degree episiotomy tear so an underwear one was out of question. I wore this the second day home from the hospital.but as far as keeping in my tummy in I would invest in another one.
2.0,The shorts are way more fitted than the photos. Way too small and not high-waisted. Like you can get the shorts on in your normal size but they definitely don't have the looser look I wanted.
2.0,"Very cheap fabric, not happy! I guess you get for what you pay for!"
2.0,It is a very pretty ring. Didn't get the size right though.
2.0,Very uncomfortable the strap went by my shoelace
2.0,The dress was made from cheap material and the size was not accurate.  Very small and the packaging was not desirable at all (very cheap packing).
2.0,"Returned, i should have guessed that the quality wasn't going to be great given the price point. I ordered the olive pants with the tassels at the end. The pants were cute but just the quality of the material felt really cheap and the tassels looked wonky and not cute. It also took a really long time to get to me so be cautious that it might get to you a week later than estimated."
2.0,Its a swimsuit type material.
2.0,"Cool design, but it was printed on a Fruit of the Loom tshirt. I was expecting a nicer quality shirt for the price."
2.0,"The watch function worked fine, and it's easy to change settings. The light is very weak, and the button for it is on the inside (i.e., elbow side) of the wrist, which makes it awkward to press. Plus, the plastic case cracked near the band within the first week of use. I returned it, and got model W-800H, which i like much better."
2.0,"It is really cute, but very hard to put on and material isn't great quality."
2.0,"These goggles are pretty well made and solid, and they are attractive.  The clasping mechanism is the only weakness, but a pretty important one.  The clasping mechanism on these is a circular tab that is punched out about 85% of the way around a wider circle, which then fits into another receiving circle to clasp the straps together behind the head.  The tab is very weak.  It often needs adjusted to fit into the receiving circle and is so weak that it's only a matter of time before it snaps off.  Think of a tab on a can of pop that you can wiggle loose and it snaps after a while.  One of our three pair lasted less than one day at the pool, the other two had to be replaced after about a half dozen trips to the pool."
2.0,This was too small for me. I ordered a 4x and it fit more like an XL. I had it altered because I waited to long to return. The material is great if you can find someone to work it into the size you need.
2.0,"This vest heats up great. But, the sizes are completely off. My husband wears a 2X. He couldn't even zip the 4x closed. I wear L/XL and I just could barely zip the 4X. Someone needs to go back to the drawing board."
2.0,Soft bit way to big. Get two sizes smaller
2.0,I ended up returning the swimsuit. It didn't work for my body. I am not small. 5'4&#34; and 185lbs. It simply did not look good on my body. I thought it would compliment my smaller waist and long waist but I looked like a deflated pool toy.
2.0,Fit was normal but the material was quite rough and itchy.  Was not like previous pajamagrams I‚Äôve recently ordered.
2.0,Looks like a stripper dress
2.0,"Did not provide much support, had to return. Seems like it might work for some people but not for me."
2.0,"I purchased these from Quality Affordable Outfitters. I ordered large. The package states large but as you can see from the attached picture of 2 socks of the same brand and thickness, this sock is much smaller."
2.0,"I really wanted this top to work out because it's really cute. But unfortunately it just looks like a shapeless sack on me, I'm 5,3 and 140lbs. I have very broad shoulders so in order for these structured tops to fit in the shoulder area I have to get a bigger size, but it ends up being so big, loose, and shapeless on my torso area. It's a shame because I really think these outfits are cute. The matching pants however fit great, I got petite medium."
2.0,Size was perfect. Quality was cheap.
2.0,Broke after wearing twice
2.0,It looks more black than purple.  Does not look like this picture.  Very disappointed.
2.0,Seven of us ordered this dress. What prompted us to get this dress was the color. It said Pink. It was great that the seller requested our measurements to custom fit the dress. When we received the dress they were not the pink that is on the website. It was the Blush pink instead. The seller insist that it is the pink we picked. Not so. Also the picture doesn‚Äôt show the pleating in the bodice clearly. There was more pleating than we expected. Now we‚Äôre stuck with a color the bride did not want.
2.0,"Material feels weird, and the fit is not quite right. Not good for curvy women."
2.0,Not as solid or sturdy as I wanted. A bit flimsy on my 2yr old. Definetly temporary wear.
2.0,Was not wide enough
2.0,"Like: vibrant colors<br /><br />Dislikes: (1) buckle is a cheap silver painted alloy, not stainless steel as advertised; (2) bracelets are way too long/loose; (3) clasp is extremely difficult to thread and close; (4) half the bracelets are coming apart (not heat sealed properly"
2.0,"I needed these gloves specifically for the cold in high wind conditions. First the good. then the bad.<br />Good:<br />- They look and feel nice. A bit bulky but you should expect that with cold whether gloves.<br />- They DO work with your phone screen.<br />- They are defiantly rain proof even at high speeds and very strong rain. (I do not know about putting them in water. I did not use them for that.)<br /><br />BAD:<br />- NOT COLD WHETHER GLOVES<br /><br />These gloves are supposed to keep your hands warm down to -30F (-34.4C). They do not in fact keep your hands warm against the high winds after about 40F (4.4C). The wind eats right through them.  This would be true on a motorcycle, snowmobile, bicycle, ect.  The palm and back of the hand stays warm, but the fingers freeze. They are definitely better than summer windproof gloves, but only slightly better than regular motorcycle riding gloves.<br /><br />I will be returning them."
2.0,"Ordered one for fun thinking it'd be something i could toss on casually.<br /><br />As many others have said: pants way too tight, jacket way too big.<br /><br />Material is veru cheap looking. There's no way I'd wear this thing seriously.<br /><br />Possible uses:<br />1) first suit for a teenager - maybe to wear to school for fun. no biggie if they drop a slice of pizza on it or run through the sprinklers in it<br />2) you just need to show up looking like you're wearing a suit, but are dirt poor<br />3) costume / prop"
2.0,"Neck is way too big! Everywhere else it fit fine. Just couldn't deal with the neck size, so sending back."
2.0,"The buttons come undone really easy, going to sew it shut as it fits over my head. Husband bought for me. Would never do buttons in bed myself."
2.0,"The band is not black stainless, it is a cheap black paint over stainless steel. Before I even unwrapped the plastic from the band there was paint missing. After removing plastic wrap from band, more missing paint. Looks pretty bad on my $250 watch. The fitment to watch seems decent. Latches securely. Unfortunately the finish of the paint is poorly done."
2.0,"I love the size and design of these huggie earrings.  I bought one pair (in the bracelet-chain link pattern) and really like how they fit, what they weigh (almost nothing!), and how they look.  I am not, however, very happy a week later.  The level of tarnish of the silver is apparent already.  They look a bit ""yellow"" as I wear them.  I have cleaned them with my polishing cloth, to no avail.  I am almost tempted to take them to my jeweler to have them rhodium-plated, but the expense wouldn't be justifiable for such inexpensive earrings."
2.0,"It looks good, but rather hotter than most of this type of mask.  The size is also smaller.  I'm going to have to find a way to stretch it a bit to fit.  Right now it's hurting my nose and cheeks<br /><br />Edit 7/2/20<br /><br />The mask is literay ripping apart.  Adding photo"
2.0,The black paint started to come off on one of the moose.
2.0,"Too small, works okay for binding for jogging if I have to."
2.0,"Nice fit, however came all bent and messed up because of shipping"
2.0,Small and the seam tore apart after one wear.
2.0,"Not really oversized, fits true to the size. Received my sweater with a hole in it. Otherwise the type of material had looked promising."
2.0,"These glasses are the usual good style and quality you expect from Eyebobs, but this style is quite large and wide.  On another note, BEWARE that this seller charges a 15% restocking fee for returned merchandise -- unnecessary if you ask me because shipping is paid by customer in both directions.  It was my fault because I didn't read the fine print ; otherwise I would have ordered them through another seller."
2.0,I returned it. Fitting not good
2.0,It was delivered without the cuff links. Felt cheated. Have not even bothered to use it. Quality seems ok though. Did not come in any case. Tie and Square were just thrown into a package containing the shoes I also ordered.
2.0,Es una tela sint√©tica cocida en forma tubular no recomendable para ni√±os.
2.0,Like appearance.  Unable to use‚Ä¶‚Ä¶too large to fit women small wrist.  Can not adjust size of this one.
2.0,It‚Äôs not a tunic. It‚Äôs not long enough for leggings. It‚Äôs a blouse.
2.0,Fits weird . I'm short and boxy<br />5'1 130lbs think I bought a medium. Hope this helps
2.0,"It's marked 2XL, but fits like an XL. It's skin tight. otherwise it's nicely made 100% cotton."
2.0,This sweater has abnormally long sleeves and fits a size our so too small
2.0,The vent broke off most of them. Don't last long. Good filters.
2.0,Very Nicely made skirt.  not flattering for persons with wider hips.  Made for slimmer body shapes
2.0,"This bag is actually super cute, but SO much smaller than I expected.  It doesn't even hold a cell phone.  Completely impractical for any use."
2.0,arrived with a broken mirror
2.0,Watch is pretty but i did not receive the bracelet that its supposed to come with.
2.0,"I thought these shoes were supposed to be comfortable!!!  Not at all, they are hard and really hurt my feet. They are beautiful shoes ! You would think that because they are very expensive they would be comfortable for work ! Buyers beware. I even purchased some shoe inserts and they wouldn't fit because these shoes are already tight and fit right to size. I'm sending mine back. I'm a Dental Hygienist and I'm on my feet a lot, these are causing foot pain for sure.  I'm  sad, because they are so pretty ."
2.0,The tank is not flattering. It's too long and runs small. Visually looks good. Depends on the body type I guess.
2.0,"The pocket holding the cellphone is not long enough, so the strap holding the phone in the pocket doesn't stay connected. Also, there's a tear in the material near the stitching. The inside coin compartment is too tiny. And there are only 4 slots total for cards, plus one for your ID. There's got to be better options than this one....I will keep looking for something else."
2.0,The biggest size is a medium<br />The pants elastic is way too small. The shirts breast holders might be for a b cup and that's being generous. The shorts elastics are better but way too short and come up half my butt cheek<br />The dress is too tight but still has my breast bubbling out and squishing them but is better than the shirt<br />Robe doesn't close ove rmy breasts. 2 inches of skin are left out when tied closed<br />I am a size 14/16 with d cup breasts and 5'3 at 175<br /><br />Good things<br />Fabric and lace is gorgeous and feels amazing. Pants are proper length for a short girl<br /><br />Bottom line is you have more than a b cup and are larger than a medium don't buy unless it's for lingerie. I bought this more as a way to feel pretty and walk round the house but I guess it's for the bedroom<br />Not worth the money
2.0,Overall it's disappointing.  fits awkwardly
2.0,"Really pretty too ring,  feels thick and solid, but it broke within 2 months.  I don't take it off so I'm not sure why it broke.  I thought it was a better solid metal"
2.0,"I loved the look and style of these, but after about a week the nuts attaching the lenses to the frames kept coming loose. The screwdriver included only fit the nose pieces so I had no way of tightening them except with my fingers which didn‚Äôt do much good. I expected them to be more delicate than sunglasses with a plastic frame, but not to practically fall about after a week, even with me being careful with them."
2.0,Not comfortable unless you are tall and thin!
2.0,"Where this band attaches to the Fitbit is not secure.  It has let go and fallen off my wrist three times in the last week.  It took me an hour searching our yard to find it!<br />I like the look of it, but will be looking for a new band."
2.0,"Sometimes I find dresses on amazon for this price and I'm shocked by how cheap and good it looks!  This was not the case.  This looks like a $19.99 dress.  Very thin material, looks almost faded, not a true black like its been washed several times (although I can tell this was never worn)  Also very tight.  I am 5'6, 145lbs and wear a 6-8.  This is a medium and its way too small.  I think if it was a larger size and the color was more vibrant it would be a good dress. It has to go back."
2.0,"These look terrible, sending back!"
2.0,Was definitely smaller than that size I ordered.
2.0,Not the greatest quality. Isn‚Äôt even lined with anything
2.0,"Very disappointed in this purchase! I am plus size which I normally buy 3x or a 4x because I like movement and not to be too snug on me. This right here was too snug, it fit like either a xl or 2xl. #Welp :'("
2.0,"They were ok, a little too snug for my liking"
2.0,"I was excited to try this bracelet.  It arrived OK.  It was a little cheap looking,  but still intact.  Unfortunately,  it broke within a week."
2.0,The buckle is pretty flimsy and the belt doesn't stay tight.
2.0,"Measured myself any everything, size chart not accurate."
2.0,this a cute outfit but size was way too small and needed to have at least a few sizes up. It only went to and XL and I couldn't get this over my shoulders
2.0,Did not realize until received that the chains are sold seperately and not as a set.  When i went to order another one it was no longer in stock.  Now I have 1.
2.0,Cute but i ordered a medium and it came large which was way to big for me.
2.0,"I‚Äôm not sure who this would look good on, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt me! It‚Äôs an odd boxy shape and the chest is HUGE. It just sort of gaped open on me and my C cups. Sending it back!"
2.0,"The quality wasn't very great. The fabric looked cheap, so I returned it."
2.0,"First pair I tried on tore as I was pulling them up. Very cheap flimsy fabric. And as someone who wears even the daintiest stockings to work regularly, I am super careful and he told when putting them on. Kinda bummed but oh well they weren't expensive so I'll try a different brand ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2.0,These did not hold up to active boys. Granted they were using them for more than catching fish and butterflies and were swooping them in the water for fun. But they didn‚Äôt last past the first day. And aren‚Äôt fish nets meant for some degree of swooping?
2.0,"The shirt runs slightly big, also it is a see through material. Just didn't like the way it looked once i got it."
2.0,"I like that it fit the way I expected, and I like that it zips up the back. What I didn‚Äôt really like is that the bones don‚Äôt extend the full length of the leg which is a bummer, but for the money you pay it‚Äôs pretty cute!"
2.0,"Very very thin, see through, and the underlining is not to the floor as pictured. The lining cuts at the knee.  The collar would not stand as pictured; it is floppy and lays flat. The tie/sash for waist is very short, impossible to make a bow. Color is almost as pictured."
2.0,"Disappointed because according to the size chart, I'd be an xl. It's far too big. Size down one. Don't order the tie dye if you believe it's a gray or black because it's definitely blue."
2.0,Didn't love the material.  You get what you pay for I guess.
2.0,"Nothing bad with the product, i just wish they specified (or maybe i missed it), that it's for super thing tongues :("
2.0,Fits my fossil Sloan and easy to exchange band with quick pins but color is off.  Says light pink but really almost white with dingy effect to it.  Tried to return but seller didn‚Äôt reply.  Poor customer service
2.0,Super small and super short
2.0,The earrings are adorable but are missing a jewel! The colors are also not half as bright as the photo looks.
2.0,Watch fades in no time
2.0,Larger fit. I ordered smallest size. It was too big at the top if you have small breasts.
2.0,"They're OK but I didnt like how flat the lens are, it makes the lens work like reflective surface for the inside because the lenses are not concave you see you reflection when wearing them. They also feel very cheap as if they will break very easily, I didn't want to risk it do I'm returning them and getting what I want instead."
2.0,They didn't fit; I had to return them and there wasn't the right size offered to replace them!
2.0,"i can't even get this to stay on for one second. there is a hard piece of cardboard inside. if you can wear these earmuffs, they may keep your ears warm. i bought them to wear inside a speakerphone, because the plastic hurts my ears.not what they were intended for."
2.0,Ok just a little smaller then I expected
2.0,It started to loose the gold look. It became worthless. I want to keep the flag and maybe put it on another gold wrist chain. It stays looking great until about 3 weeks later I‚Äôd like. I good.
2.0,The connecting piece is made up of very cheap like plastic.  I've only been using it for a couple days so we'll see if it holds up and I'll try to update later on.<br />For the price I'd say it serves its purpose.<br />Also the colors were slightly different from the picture.  I purchased thinking one was black and another was red so my fiance and I could share the pack when in reality the red was darker pink and the black was Grey.<br />Would I buy again?  Probably not.  I wish I would have just bought better quality ones that come separately rather then this multi pack. I won't be dealing with returning as I do need a band as of now but I will be buying better ones and using these just for now.
2.0,Bulkier than expected. The snake's head and its tail doesn't rest flush against my collar bone/neck. It sticks out. And since it's already. Bulky the necklace comes across in an awkward manner.
2.0,"Looks and feels cheap, not what it looked like online"
2.0,"These were the &#34;small&#34; size, but they're still too big. I like the flip up feature, but the lenses hang down onto my cheeks. Not very comfortable."
2.0,"I really wanted to love this bra, especially since the sublime nursing bra and the sports bra are so great. Those ones are very comfortable and work great. This one is a little weird.<br />First off, it is very soft, which is nice. However, it offers no support on the sides. There's nothing to keep you in the bra, I guess, since the band is thinner and the seam doesn't come high enough to really support. When the clasps are undone, the inner strap isn't tight enough to keep the bra in place. The cups are closer together than normal for my normal bra size, and the band is kinda big.<br />I wear a 32B, and have for years. I'm not any bigger or smaller after having children or with breastfeeding. But with this particular bra, I wish they had a smaller band size. This one just doesn't stay put.<br />I can live with this bra, and at this point I'll just have to keep it. It's basically a last resort kind of bra, though.<br />For the record, I would never, ever pay $50 for this bra. Even the $25 I spent on it was too overpriced for what I got. I'm glad it was discounted, but it's still a waste. I'm so sad about this purchase and I wish I didn't jump at the discount Amazon was offering."
2.0,"Small size 10, the center stone is plain white the blue stones are pretty and the design is nice."
2.0,"I was expecting a softer, more casual fabric, but the skirt is a fairly stiff and heavy fabric. Definitely to need to size up one or two sizes, and if you have any kind of belly or hips, the pockets don't lay flat and the whole skirt is distorted."
2.0,These have a warning in California which I did not see on the product info. I am using them with children and sure would have like to have known before I bought them. Also they are really small even for kids.
2.0,"I am a farmer and bought these for winter wear.  They are warm and windproof. But they are not waterproof.<br /><br />In a driving rain,  the suit seems absorbent. My pants worn under the suit will be soaked.<br /><br />The "" phone pocket"" is too small for modern phones.  If you put your phone in a breast pocket,  if it's raining water builds upon the pocket and soaks your phone.<br /><br />There's no insulation over the hands pockets,  so I'd you're cold,  putting your hands in your pockets does no good.<br /><br />In order to fit my bust, I had to get the XL. I'm 5'5"". I have to roll the pant legs 1 foot.  The very nice zippers to accommodate boots mean that they would need to be professionally tailored to shorten.<br /><br />The built in hood is nice.  The zippers stay closed. And I do stay warm in -20F snow.  But it's like it's a different suit when it's raining. Also,  because of the insulation,  when it gets wet it takes forever to dry."
2.0,too short and very see through
2.0,"Earrings are beautiful, however, they do not work.  One worked, the other one would not stay on the ear. I don't know if I just got a bad pair but too much trouble for me to send back. Too bad, because they really are beautiful."
2.0,I hate the material cheaply made
2.0,I was very disappointed with this item.  You need to hold the button down for it work. It's very hard to use. I had bought another one which works a lot more better and I  don't need to hold down the button.  The items that come with it are great but this item is hard to use.
2.0,Dislike closure front falling not sturdy
2.0,This was EXTREMELY disappointing.  I bought the cover up for vacation and could not use it at all.  It runs VERY small and the criss cross action was less than easy.
2.0,"It arrived quickly, and looks great,  just like shown in picture. HOWEVER, description states soft and comfortable in several places. This is not at all soft! I reached my hand in to feel it both outside and inside. It is very scratchy and rough to the touch. It is a Christmas gift for my daughter, therefore I will not take out of package in case i need to return it. I'm not even sure she will wear it despite how nice it looks since it is rough. Very disappointed as all her middle school friends play Among Us, I thought this would a great gift. I know it says polyester, but I have lots of other items of clothing made of the same material and they don't feel like this. So item does not match the description. Buyer beware."
2.0,Was to short to be a tunic.
2.0,This item was not even remotely what's pictured. Way shorter not the loose neckline that's pictured definitely don't recommend.
2.0,It doesn‚Äôt fit to size I‚Äôm a large I need a extra large so that it wyfit right
2.0,The bust was just to big. The rest fit good.
2.0,The plastic on inside of mask sticks up and rubs on face and nose üëÉ not comfortable
2.0,I am 5'8.5 and slender. They just didnt fit right. Roll up my leg and dont sit right around waist. Not comfortable for me.<br />Maybe good for shorter person.
2.0,"These as you see are not what I ordered however they are nice seem to be strong. Although nice, you should get what you order."
2.0,"Won't stay up well on my little ones legs, but they are very cute for the price. maybe for pictures or an event but not really practical day to day use."
2.0,"This dress fit, but looked like a weird length. It didn't look cute on. Mid-back rise and VERY low in the front. The bust was twisted and small. Much better in the pic."
2.0,I really was expecting something better with the quality.
2.0,Runs really small. Not for people with a booty.
2.0,"Bought these directly from Manufacturer (Based in UK).  I wear 34 so I ordered M (32-35"" listed).  the waist MAY be 32, but seems even tighter.  No way these things can go up to 35"" because the adjustments near the belt loops on the side are all the way open and they are tighter than 32"" on me.<br /><br />Long story short, $17 return on a $31 pair of shorts is really bad news.  Ordering a size up means they'll be even further below my knee and baggier.  Sucks because I love everything about these shorts they just aren't sized appropriately.<br /><br />I am dissapoint.  :|"
2.0,"Way too small, even after sizing up. Returning. Otherwise, they are a little thinner on the insulation than I would have liked, but they leather looks nice and the purple color was pretty. Oh well.<br />For reference, I measure as a medium per their size chart. I have borderline child-size hands, seriously, and tiny wrists.  I purchased the XL for my mother, since she has the same size hands but prefers a looser fit due to some arthritis in her knuckles. The XL was snug on me so clearly didn‚Äôt work for her. Since we already bought the largest size offered, not much more we can do."
2.0,"I love the way it looked, but didn't stay closed. Was galling off all the time. I only wore it for a week. I was afraid I was going to loose my watch."
2.0,"The dress fits as expected, but the fabric was very stiff and wrinkled.  I tried to iron it, but the fabric was difficult to smooth out.  Sending it back."
2.0,"thought it was extremely cute and worked well for carrying my teaching supplies in, but only lasted me about 2-3 weeks before the handle snapped. cute and all, but wouldn't recommend for durable carrying"
2.0,"The bracelets broke and faded, not worth purchasing."
2.0,"The product looks acceptable. However, came without a tag, nor the balck Bioworld bag, like the other wallets and backpacks, I bought in the same store. Made me think, that probably it was a pre-owned /returned item.<br /><br />Very disappointed."
2.0,"Thin material. Way too small. Maybe it‚Äôs just the bigger sizes whose measurements aren‚Äôt correct? Ordered an XL, ended up having to reorder the biggest size and it still didn‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôm regularly a dress size 14. Ridiculous."
2.0,Durable product but much too large. Definitely not 38mm. At least 42 if not 44.
2.0,Quality is not the best. The sleeves roll up on its own and the material is not breathable. So expect to get hot in this thing.
2.0,The actual dress doesn‚Äôt look anything like the picture at all!
2.0,Bought an xl as it is my normal size...wasn‚Äôt even able to pull it together to zip it...
2.0,"I prefer to wear scoop necks because higher necklines bother me (like a constant tickling). I also like the way a lower scoop looks. I purchased these because the product photo shows a nice scoop neck. In reality, the neckline is much higher, as the photo that I posted shows. Apart from that, the garment meets expectations, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
2.0,"Described as a Minimals Wallet ... NOT True !<br />Several Credit Cards later & it‚Äôs your Average Thick, burdensome Wallet"
2.0,Material and design is not exactly what shows. Cant really tell it's a skull. More along the lines of a swimsuit tie dye shirt
2.0,Normal quality and i paid 2$ to view it in my inbox coz they didn't include the price or details
2.0,It's not that great
2.0,"I purchased these June 4th and got them august 29th so they took a while to get here. Also I'm pretty sure these are smaller than 14 gauge, but not by much. The add on piece is SO tiny. I don't consider myself to have large nipples, but these were just a tad too small. They didn't feel too badly made though."
2.0,Waaaaaaaaay too small.  Like xl isn‚Äôt even a basic medium.
2.0,wasn't happy at all....wish I could return.
2.0,Way too tight-- could not get it over my head. My mother is a size 10/12 and she couldn't it over her head either. Too bad. It was pretty.
2.0,"I like the original design but the quality was cheap, looks like something you could buy at Walmart for $.99"
2.0,Actual color does not match with the picture. Not the fabric nor the buckle or grommets. Cheaper quality. Very disappointing.
2.0,I've been wearing this daily for four days - not in the shower and not to bed - and it's turning my finger green. The stone is beautiful but the setting is falsely advertised.
2.0,"It does not say the ring size, in the picture it looks like an adult hand, although it does fit in different fingers but they are nit functional. IT IS A TOY!!!!"
2.0,Was not impressed with the quality of the fabric....the style was very unflattering.
2.0,Leather too thick and buckle oversized. Uncomfortable
2.0,The belt I received was NOT like the color advertised.  The buckle is hard to get on and off.
2.0,"It keeps slipping always pulling it up, and its scratchy. It's ok to wear for short periods"
2.0,I loved the look of this case but after using it for a year the hinge no longer clasps shut but rather just flops around.
2.0,Top fit ok i got an extra large because im usually a large and it was still tight and the bottoms dont fit at all they feel like they would be a medium
2.0,The earrings is so small and it‚Äôs really difficult to put the lock because it‚Äôs hard to see the whole or either to hold it.I hope next time they can make more longer so that it‚Äôs easy to put on the ears.The good thing of this earrings it‚Äôs just a cute design.
2.0,didn&#34;t fit well on thin band
2.0,The socks we received are not what is shown in the picture.
2.0,Beware from the very first day we had this the wire that creates the bracelet shape comes out the head of the snake and jabs your wrist. Has to be pushed back in it over and over.
2.0,I didn't like these shorts because it was too bulky.  I felt like I was sliding off of my stationary bike.  I returned it.
2.0,"I don't have very big hands, but the magnetic band barely fits around them. Makes it very difficult to take off and put back on."
2.0,"Size chart for this is a complete, total lie. It's at least two sizes two small - at least. It's also ridiculously thin. Not what I expected."
2.0,Ordered a 2xl to go over clothes walking around Halloween night. No where close to a 2xl. More like large at the most.
2.0,It broke 4 days after we got it
2.0,Thinner than what was expected. :-(
2.0,They are pretty but I‚Äôll never see it on my wrist because they don‚Äôt fit my watch. IW1 is not a correct description for a replacement. I‚Äôm returning it.
2.0,I think it is a waste of money on this type of product
2.0,"When I received the top it was very crumbled , the wrinkles are very bad even if I steam it as soon as it is touched the wrinkles come back.<br />Like the color."
2.0,"The look of this shirt is great, however the material is such that if you snag it, it pulls big loops out and then becomes something you may not want to wear.  I found this out a little late to return so sent it to goodwill."
2.0,"This was a fun dress to wear for my work Christmas party but I suspect it's a one time use dress as it is easy to see from the seams that it is very cheap. It came very wrinkled and smells like gingivitis although I was scared if I washed it, it would fall apart.  In summary, cute idea, fun for the night but know it's not going to be one you hold onto."
2.0,"it looks good on the model, but its cheesy fabric feels horrible. the refund was timely."
2.0,"The pattern is cute , but I found it to fit tight and the elastic holds it even tighter, instead of letting it stretch fit as needed. It‚Äôs very thin material and light weight so if there is any breeze then it‚Äôs going to float up high. I really wanted to like it but it just felt off to me."
2.0,"Kind of a strange fit, especially across the toes. I‚Äôm returning, and unfortunately didn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs not prime so have to pay for the darn shipping.  ‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,Very cheaply made and doesn‚Äôt look very nice
2.0,I was so excited for this- but It doesn‚Äôt fit right for my body- 30DD chest 26.5 waist and 34 hips.  I‚Äôm too meaty for it and sizing up sadly would mean zero support.  I think if you have less chest it would be great for my main problem is the wire part will not stay down! After my first review the company did reach out and very much want to make it right so the customer service is beyond what I expected.
2.0,You can see through it. That was not the look I wanted it.
2.0,"The earring itself was pretty, but was much smaller than I anticipated. I had some earrings very similar that I bought about 7 years ago from the jewelry store, but I lost one sadly. Tried finding those exact earrings for quite awhile to no avail. I thought these would be very close but they were nothing like what I expected. Also because of the pin straight post with the hoop earring, it took me forever to even get the earring through my ear (I never have problems like that).  I did have to bend the back piece up a little bit like how most other earrings are. Thankfully I was at least able to get them in. I most likely won‚Äôt wear these often. It‚Äôs just too bad as I had these in my list for some time."
2.0,"This is a super cute hat, but it is way too big. I couldn't wear it even when adjusted to the tightest possible setting on the velcro strap."
2.0,it was nice but didn't receive my gift box
2.0,Returning - Runs long and narrow.
2.0,"Top fit fine, but the skirt was way too large.  The pocket I that I thought looked cute in the pics, stood out at weird angle and made my hips look really wide.  Not a good fit on my curvy body.  Otherwise the dress itself was well made and really pretty."
2.0,Beautiful piece; but the length in the description is deceiving. This is no where near 34&#34; in length.
2.0,"The skirt I received was definitely much longer than advertised. Folded over and hiked up like an empire waist, it hits me below the knee, I'm 5'3&#34;. 2 stars for soft material, as I only bought this for labor. Folding it over a few times will look chunky, but no big deal."
2.0,Got this as a gift for my niece. She liked it but it came broken. Her mom said it looks like they can fix it but that is very disappointing.
2.0,"One pair fits fine, the other is a bad cut and fits too small at the top and too big in the legs"
2.0,Very cheaply made. Extremely disappointed
2.0,I gave these away - too thin
2.0,Necklace was to small but the earrings where perfect and the design was nice
2.0,"I ordered a Tara and got an Alexis. Therefore this is not something I will ever wear. It's lovely though and I really wish I had one in my name. It makes me think of Sex and the City's Carrie. It's gold plated, dainty, the perfect size, on a chain that isn't too long nor too short. It comes in a lovely little gift box too."
2.0,"Pockets are awkward, size up one size atleast."
2.0,The color is very different and it is very heavy.. Not as shown in the picture or as Expected.
2.0,I‚Äôve purchased Cadmus bike shorts before and they were great not see through and comfy. these were different no where near as stretchy and not comfortable and the stitching on the waistband and legs have no stretch. On the picture I attached you can see the old ones on the left and the new ones on the right. I read in the description that if you have a big butt you should size up or two so maybe that‚Äôs why but still I‚Äôll be returning and trying something else.
2.0,good smaller brief case except the main zipper broke
2.0,Very light weight could be stronger
2.0,"I did not like this shirt at all, I tried it on and it was immediately returned. The fabric felt funky, the fit was awkward, it just wasn‚Äôt flattering."
2.0,"Nice, but I was somewhat disappointed at the stress of inputting the pictures. I ordered this wanting to put pictures of my three grandkids in it as a gift for their mother.  I wanted to use squares for the boys' pictures and a circle for the girl's picture, but there wasn't room for that combination.  I had to use circles for all three frames in order to fit three pictures in it.  I still think it would look nicer with squares and circles. I ran into difficulty with the instructions as well and almost ran out of picture frames from learning how to do it on my own. In my opinion, the instructions left a lot to be desired. Then I had trouble getting pictures small enough to fit in the frames, but soon realized that I couldn't input the actual size of the frames (8mm) into the awesome picture-maker that comes with the necklace (gives address and code for online website - now that was fun!) because the pictures were too large.  8 mm kept coming out much larger than 8 mm.  I finally input for 5 mm pics and sure enough the pics came out a perfect 8mm. When I attempted to remove the plastic/laminate from the paper it was on, I wasn't able to separate the two.  The plastic/laminate was to go over the pictures (like glass does in a regular picture frame) but instead a layer of paper would come off and the plastic would remain stuck to the other part of the paper.  Hard to explain.  I ended up not having a protective cover for the photos.  I also couldn't get the pictures to stay in the frames, so I ended up using just a dab of Elmer's glue. Worked fine.  I also ordered a package of small jewels for the necklace and they look very nice in the locket when the picture frames are removed.  I don't recommend this product because it really did take a lot of time to do something that should have been simple.  Clearer, more precise instructions and better quality paper/laminate would have been a huge help.  The finished project did not look as clean cut and I wanted because of all the handling required in order to get the pictures in the frames."
2.0,I bought this for my bf birthday and it doesnt work
2.0,Product size not accurate
2.0,The sweater fits good but the sleeves are big like a balloon. So if I get a smaller size it won't fit<br />The sleeved isn't as narrow and neat as the picture described
2.0,Hard to get cash in and out of clip.
2.0,These are great glasses for the polarization and the price however mine do have lines across the one lens which are super annoying. My brother has a pair that are completely fine so I'm thinking it must be a defective pair but worth noting.
2.0,Much cuter in photo. Not very flattering unless you have an absolutely flat tummy.<br />I do not......
2.0,Absolutely love the material and thickness but I bought a 2xl and it fit like a medium/large. Super small
2.0,They are too loose on the top and slide right off your feet if you try to do yoga or pilates in them
2.0,"The one I got had a weak/awkward zipper, and it didn't look as nice as the picture, so I returned it. It was also bigger than I expected from the dimensions, but that would not have been a problem."
2.0,Very fragile and ended up breaking during my reception.
2.0,"I assumed this ring would be somewhat small but would at least fit one of my fingers. It really doesn't any of my fingers, I guess it does fit somewhat uncomfortably around my pinky. I have worn it above my knuckle before but was afraid it was going to fall off because it's too loose. I guess you get what you pay for, but unless this is for a small child, I would save a couple bucks."
2.0,Updated Review. Jan 10/ 2015<br />Two pair of new briefs fell apart in crotch after first time wearing them. Would not buy again!<br /><br />Nice quality and very comfortable. I really like that these briefs are designed with the shorter cut for leg length and so far they have not rolled up or been stuck up when doning my britches.
2.0,"these do not hang well, they look like a big ball of pink yarn and are super uncomfortable."
2.0,I love the socks - BUT - I order for my husband - I ordered Large - I received small - so I am wearing around the house.  Disappointed that they were not what I ordered because he really needs them - I don't - too much trouble to return.
2.0,This shirt is not advertised correctly. I thought I was getting a reverse tie dye. Instead it looks like the shirt was dipped in bleach and left for awhile. Super faded looking. Which makes the lettering hard to see. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Wish I could return. After ironing, gets wrinkled the very moment you sit"
2.0,"Disappointed in this necklace.  I had to change out the lobster claw clasp because it wouldn't open, and add a ring between the flowers that enables them to lie flat.  Unless you are willing and able to make jewelry repairs, avoid this purchase."
2.0,Very thin transparent material so I wonder how much sun protection it really provides.
2.0,"The whole back was sheer. I wanted something to wear publicly and professionally, so I had to return this blouse. I didn‚Äôt see anything in the description explaining that the shirt was completely see-through. Now you know. I sent it back."
2.0,"Glad to have a replacement band.  Had I not worked where I installed watch bands, I would not have been able to install it as no instructions were enclosed.  Don't like the silver bukle. Would have preferred a black buckleb"
2.0,"I think this should be sold as a womans cap. I wear caps all the time, but this one was just too small."
2.0,"the fit was ok...it does show every bump and roll.  when i walked it would bunch up near the  pelvic area which is not flattering.  the material was a jersey knit that, to me, looked and felt more suited to a casual event then a formal one."
2.0,This band IS NOT for a series 1. I needed a pretty band to wear for an upcoming event. Its pretty but it does not fit my watch. Im seeking a refund or exhange
2.0,poor quality marble. Just didn't have time to return.
2.0,"The quality of this product is superb; I loved the color, soft white.  However, it was a fight to get it on/off.<br />I measure 33.5"".  The stretch of this bras lower band is barely 34"".  If I had no shoulders it'd been a piece of cake. If there's a knack to getting it on/off, I'd love to know what it is.  If it had a front zipper, I'd have kept it and bought more because of the great quality."
2.0,The bag ripped open after I used it a few times
2.0,Looked very good at the beginning. Broke at the buckle after 2 months.<br />Would like to replace it.
2.0,"Very cheap material, didn't fit.  Would not recommend"
2.0,"If this bag's zipper were placed properly, it would be the perfect bag.  But right now, 1/4 of it sticks out to one side, while there's a gap on the other.  It makes it tedious to close the bag unless you put the bag down, and then use both hands."
2.0,"This bag was too small to hold any standard size container of shampoo, conditioner, body soap. That made it useless since i will not buy trial sizes which are not cost effective. I returned it for this reason."
2.0,No lo comprar√≠a otra vez
2.0,"I bought several of these, and really liked them. Unfortunately, I didn't try all of the bands right away. When I went to switch to the green one, I noticed that the buckle is on backwards, so there is no way to use it. Clearly, the quality control on these is not very good. Make sure you check them right away!!"
2.0,These would have been awesome minus the fact all 3 pairs had holes in them.
2.0,The fabric is cheap and see through
2.0,Probably not gonna use this on my Panerai. Doesn't fit the rubber strap very well and being it's a spring bar and not a screw bar... I'll just toss it in the drawer.
2.0,The material is see through and shiny.. Will use as a beach cover up.
2.0,"The band continually came unhooked from the watch. I almost lost my watch twice, and finally said ""screw it"" and went back to the one that came with the watch."
2.0,I bought an 8 which is my usual size and the length was great but the width was too much. I have regular feet and my feet were swimming in these and no way to tighten the straps across the toes so the show just hung on my foot. Disappointed in this one.
2.0,"Don't waste your money if you're larger than a DD cup, this will be too small."
2.0,The green I received was much darker and way different fit. There was also a weird smell to it and I wasn‚Äôt going to chance washing it then not being able to return it.
2.0,the chain is really cheap i expected better
2.0,"Ok but not reliable.  The bands constantly popped off as well as the lens cap on most of the finger lights. Also when they arrived some of the lights were on already. When testing the lights, about 10 out of 40 did not work.  I have bought this pack two other times and did not have this problem so not sure if it's the vendor or the product but the quality has definitely gone downhill."
2.0,Cute ...too short on the sides...I won‚Äôt order this again
2.0,Beautiful dress but not true to size. I would order two sizes up.
2.0,"Company is out of China. The seller offered half of my money back which I accepted, since the cost to return would be greater than the original price.<br /><br />I purchased a large and went by the measurements provided in the size chart. Which differs from the small print.<br /><br />Either way it wasn't accurate. If you have a large bottom and small breasts it may work for you. I'd say the cup is an A size. Maybe a small B."
2.0,It turned my skin green. No bueno.
2.0,I wasn‚Äôt as happy as I thought I would be. Comfy shirt but looks sloppy on.
2.0,"Cheaply made. The design is almost like a cheap paint on thick fake leather band. After wearing less tgan 2 weeks, it's already cracking. Do not waste your money."
2.0,"It does not have a safe clasp, if it opens the watch falls right off your wrist"
2.0,nice look but rather heavy and clip backs pinch!  Probably would not recommend for most and would not purchase again.
2.0,Too small. The back strap that comes around the heel and is suppose to buckle is toooo short.  So you would need to buy a size to big for it to fit
2.0,The ring that came looked similar to the picture but it was creepy looking. Painted it over with clear nail polish so it didn't stain my finger green. A little disappointed but satisfied
2.0,"Quality of the earrings itself is good (hence the two stars), but cannot see the printed pattern without magnification.  I bought these because I loved the color and the steampunk pattern that shows on the product picture, but was disappointed when they arrived.  Even holding it up close just inches from my face I cannot make out the design.  I had to literally use a magnifying glass to make it out.  Looking in the mirror two feet away, the earrings look like they are solid black."
2.0,I misunderstood the description of the jacket. I was disappointed that it was water resistant only on the front torso.<br />Thank you for your quick response on my return and I still love smartwool!
2.0,When I ordered these I thought there would have been something to cover the fingers.  I can't even imaging how these will keep you warm.  I was embarrassed to give these as a gift.
2.0,"These had an odd fit for me...loose in the stride but snug through the legs. I ordered a small, which is my typical size (4/6). The fabric was also different than I expected...&#34;slicker&#34; for lack of a better word.  In the end I decided to return these."
2.0,"Too small, returned it."
2.0,Does fit as expected and wasn‚Äôt fitted will. But got what I wanted thou like the way I imagine it.
2.0,Used on a fishing rod and it applied uneven and the texture is super sticky. Ruined that rod.
2.0,Flimsy.. not worth the money
2.0,The quality on these is great but the sizing is off. There is no way the XL would even begin to fit the model in the picture; and my size 16-18 thighs are not as large as the model. I wanted to like them and I wanted them to fit but I sent them back.
2.0,"I'm a size 8-10 and bought an XL based on reviews. Just didn't fit right, a little big and no cleavage support at all.  Cute fabricand ruffle.  Returned it."
2.0,"I‚Äôm completely baffled at all of the positive reviews. The material is not flattering at all, it‚Äôs pretty much bathing suit material. I definitely would NEVER wear these out in public."
2.0,Shoes are light didn‚Äôt last long at all got them September 27 . October 21 I have a hole on the side
2.0,The zipper is on the opposite side (not normal). In the photo shown above there is a 6&#34; Chinese company name printed on the front. On the back of  the jacket the same size lettering is printed multiple times between the shoulder blades. The print is 14&#34; - 17&#34; in length. I ordered my jacket two sizes larger that I normally wear. It is a snug fit. Smaller than I expected. I liked the elastic on the cuffs. The color is great. The print pattern is okay. I liked the hood and the overall design.
2.0,It‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not cotton and thus a disappointment.
2.0,"I really liked the look of the bag and that it came with a pouch, lunch box and water bottle. It is lightweight and a good size for a 2nd grader. However, after just 1 week of using the bag the shoulder strap is ripping out."
2.0,Was to small. Cheap material. Thought it was navy blue but it is a dark black and blue instead. Dress was frade at the bottom and ends. I ordered a size up from my normal and it was still too small in the shoulders.
2.0,"As soon as I felt these darts in my hand I was like OMG the is unreal perfect and what iv been looking for until I go to throw them that are a disaster, they are not balanced right  when the land in the board the flights are always pointing to the ground.  Iv tried long short shafts loads of different flights makes no difference I'm so disappointed with dem ... useless....have other sets of darts here similar to urs with same diameter same barrel length and weight only they have no grip and they all land in the board flights pointing upwards... also after a week of throwing dem trying to get used to them the points went really flat from hitting the wire in the board 1 dart even bent at the point ..I'm still in love with the feel of them .. has anyone else had a problem like this?."
2.0,"Sent it back because they sent the wrong color but even if it was the right color, I didn't care for the fit and it didn't have pockets."
2.0,The lenses are not very good
2.0,"I ordered this suit after seeing the style and loving it. I was highly unimpressed. I usually wear a medium in bottoms and either a medium or large in tops. I read reviews that this ran small so I ordered the set in large. Neither piece fit. The bottoms were too big (I wasn't surprised). However, the top fit way too small in the cups, but the straps and band were extremely loose. I sent this back immediately.<br />The only thing I like about it was the color."
2.0,You get what you pay for. It's so pretty but it came BROKEN. I'm so sad because everyone's reviews were so good. What the heck. Might reorder it lol.
2.0,Small and too flexible.
2.0,Cheap pitcure printed on the front. Looks like a $1.99 shirt.  : (
2.0,Too big for desired project. Otherwise very pretty.
2.0,"The sleeves are puffy & ridiculous & ruin the shirt!! Also the material is like a thermal shirt material, but almost see through! Very disappointed! Tired of ordering shirts from Amazon & they take forever to deliver them look completely different than expected"
2.0,"okay as a everyday tank...If you are wanting Compression, skip these.  These are NOT compression tanks.  Very Misleading."
2.0,Cheap cheap cheap. Not worth the little money you‚Äôre paying for.
2.0,"The battery for this product didn't last long. Fully charged battery, when plugged into the jacket is cycles through the 3 temps (colors) and doesn't stay one."
2.0,The material was shiny like costume
2.0,I feel that these not short people friendly. The straps were way too long and no way of adjusting them. Even if I do go down a smaller size the straps would still be way too long. Great fit if you're over 5'5 but for those shorties like me I would recommend not to buy.
2.0,"Keep falling off not holding on to ear, way too padded."
2.0,"Do not like the material it was made of, good graphics the fit ,neck on shirt to big,will check what materials that T-shirts are made of before buying again my bad cotton is the best"
2.0,The Silk screen is impossible to see!
2.0,"Good price, but the jewels started to come out after the 2nd time I wore it.  Needs stronger glue to keep them in.  Now they have almost all fallen out."
2.0,"Much bigger than I was expecting. Far too big to be a keychain, but I gave it to someone for Christmas and they hung it in their car. It comes with several different chains/necklaces, but not the short one shown."
2.0,Quality of material is good but the legs are way too tight on my son- 14 year old regifted to his younger brother who is 9 and the legs fit him although the waist is way too big for a 9 year old (he says he will wear a belt-)
2.0,I love them but some of the pictures were blurry.I only can use 4 out of the package.
2.0,Top was VERY small and pants were slightly large
2.0,This is a cute necklace but my daughter CAN NOT wear it because it falls apart
2.0,"Much smaller than sizing guide suggests. Size up. I returned. It looks more like a bikini top, not a crop top."
2.0,"This is a nice item, but arrived with hanger wrinkles as it been folded on a hanger, the skirt is plastic so I don't know how to remove the wrinkles. Can't iron it or it will melt"
2.0,"It's a cute dress but very poorly made.  A crucial seem ripped after only two weeks of use. Basically the top and the bottom halves became separated in the front. See attached photos.  If your daughter is like mine, she will want to wear it every day for the first few days she has it so take my advice, spend a little more money and buy something a better quality."
2.0,"I like how this looks, but I don't see it stamped anywhere. Is this really silver?"
2.0,Poor quality. broke and beads everywhere
2.0,Material is nice but fits really small
2.0,"It is too short for my big melon, and really hard to get over the earpieces on my wayfarer style glasses. J-E-T-S  Jets- Jets- Jets !!"
2.0,"UPDATE:<br />After wearing this for 2 weeks, the metal coating wore off the charms and gave me an ALLERGIC REACTION. DO NOT BUY if you have sensitive skin or any kind of metal allergy. I think this would be a wonderful wristband IF you have no skin issues.<br /><br />I loved this watchband. I think the key is to measure your wrist before you buy. I have been wearing a traditional buckle-style wristband for about a year now, and I've noticed that it always seems either too tight or too loose. The elastic band on this Fitbit band really feels like nothing. Looking at it, I thought that the silver charms would be uncomfortable, but I've barely noticed them.  I haven't had any issues with tightness or looseness, its the perfect size.<br />It's also quite nice because I can just slide it on with one hand, instead of having to buckle it with the other.<br />I kickbox frequently, and I've always had an issue with my buckle band. When I put on my hand wraps, I have to wrap them over my wrist, so I move my Fitbit up to my forearm to avoid accidentally pressing buttons while I throw punches. I can easily move this to my forearm without it sliding around like a normal watchband, though it gets a bit tight.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks VERY stylish, doesn't look like a watchband (which I love)<br />- Elastic fits the wrist snugly enough to get your steady heart rate, but not so snug it hurts<br />- Charms don't snag on anything or even feel like much at all<br />- Easy to slip on and off, no hassle<br />- Could potentially use it as a hair tie in a pinch<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Need to measure your wrist before ordering, not adjustable but still elastic<br />- The charms clang against my laptop while I type (not always, and not a huge issue)<br />- May cause issues if you have some kind of metal allergy because of the charms? I have a nickel and copper allergy and haven't had any issues at all though.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this Fitbit band. I have tried many different kinds - the original rubber wristband gives me a rash, the woven ones I have worn have either frayed or started to smell funny even after regular washing. This is different, its extremely stylish and feels like nothing."
2.0,"I love the look of this necklace & wore it immediately upon receiving it.  Versatile, classy, unique. Does not look cheap for the price. Unfortunately, within wearing this for less than 3 hours once of the metal pieces on the end fell off and subsequently made me lose the silver ball as well.  I am asking for a replacement for this product-I love the style enough to attempt it once more for the price, but if it breaks again I will return & not purchase again.  Does appear like a necklace one could make relatively easily with supplies from an arts & craft store."
2.0,"The size is just way too big compared to others of this similar style. I am small , so I cant get a size smaller. Pretty disappointed with it."
2.0,"Very thin, boxy cut, easily wrinkles. Would work well as an element for a costume but otherwise it won't hold up as a coat."
2.0,"looked nice, but size fit too small and was uncomfortable ."
2.0,Fits more like a sack then a dress
2.0,I wasn‚Äôt expecting this kind fabric.
2.0,I didn't like the material at all. I actually didn't use it!
2.0,"I'm a size 12, ordered the XL, and this was much too small. Even if they had a larger size, it's pretty cheap looking and I'm returning it."
2.0,"The item was too large than described. The material looked cheap and rough.<br />Unfortunately, I have returned the item."
2.0,"I bought these for my son's halloween costume, and I'll make them work, but they are not as all as descrived.  These are sheer nylons (aka panty hose) rather than tights.  Also the bones are silver glitter not white."
2.0,Sweatshirt does not look like photo at all. Disappointed in the quality. My grandson liked it although  was not what I expected.
2.0,"The bra top has seamless cups which are comfy, I'm a size 12-the bra fit but the bottoms were way too small."
2.0,"This is very nice looking and hold a lot of credit cards, however it scratches and dents very early.  I have it in a pocket by itself and somehow my slacks pockets are scratching it up."
2.0,Way too short. I think they keep the length the same for all the sizes because I got an xl and it was way short like a bikini would be. Nice fabric and such but not wearable. Also it was super loose
2.0,"I received this as a gift for Christmas, and while it is very beautiful, it stopped working within 4 months."
2.0,"It was nice while it worked -- which was not quite one year of service.  I received this as a gift for Christmas 2015.  Just before this past Christmas, the left winding mechanism stopped, and the right winder become very slow.  Within days, both were non-functional.  So now I have a very attractive watch case with no ability to wind my automatic watches."
2.0,Way bigger than described/shown.
2.0,"Would make a good Halloween costume, or dress for a pre-teen. The material is flimsy and thin like a kid‚Äôs dress up or dance costume."
2.0,When it arrived it had strings coming off of it and has started to unravel.
2.0,These are funny however the mask is too small. I‚Äôm average sized and it barely covers my face and puckers on the side
2.0,"Very thin material, smells like burnt plastic, does not fit as described, runs very small."
2.0,"This top was a bit of a disappointment.  I was expecting a softer fabric with a blousy fit and the actual product was more of a screen printed design on a somewhat stiff fabric.  Also, despite ordering the size that was recommended on the size chart, it fits much more snuggly and isn‚Äôt as comfortable or flattering as I expected.  I wish I wouldn't have missed the window to return it - or at least exchange it for a larger size to see if it fit better."
2.0,Was expecting something I could use as a handkerchief. But these are far too thin and afraid I've to be used as such. Almost feels like polyester.
2.0,More like a bootcut than a bellbottom... haven‚Äôt worn them because I was definitely looking for a bell bottom style.
2.0,"This looks really weird... and it's way to big ! I'm 5'2""and 125lbs and this is huge in the waist.  I dont like the material either"
2.0,"Pretty sheer, you have to wear something under it."
2.0,"Circle is too large, completely covers belly button and then some. Not flattering."
2.0,"Picture shows two keychains for sale. Only received one. I am happy with the one I received, but I feel lied to.<br /><br />I had expected to receive two of them, as described/shown in the picture."
2.0,Extremely Cheaply Made Boots
2.0,Loved the purse but strap broke the first week i had it
2.0,"Looks cool in the picture, but doesn't come with good direction to put it on.  My daughter was disappointed that she couldn't figure it out for her Halloween costume."
2.0,"Maybe they were too small ( I wear shoe size 7.5) But these things squeezed and hurt my feet all day, especially near the toe area where they are the tightest. Don't buy unless tiny feet"
2.0,Very pretty when it came in but started loosing color quickly.  Would not buy again. I was embarrassed that I gave several of these as gifts.
2.0,These slippers are good quality but they were to be size 6 and i think they must be size 9. Way to big for my small feet. What can I do? Helen
2.0,"Picture shown with women wearing crown does not match what I received. The crown is very small. It only lays flat across the forehead. It does not lay the full circumference of the head. If you are looking for the crown for frontal pictures, then it is ok. There are no flowers at back of head, only the ribbon to secure the crown to your head. The flowers are beautiful."
2.0,"My ears didnt react well to these, these were hard to get in to my ears and caused an infection"
2.0,I didn't receive the correct hat.
2.0,I like the tight fitting material but it‚Äôs very cheaply made and is super thin
2.0,"The style is cute, but it arrived with holes in it and had to be returned. The quality isn't there"
2.0,Too soon to give a honest review on this item. Let's see if it will hold up for a few monthsüòë
2.0,This was a nice shirt but it was very tight and too long. I ordered another color that fit perfectly.
2.0,Bottom is G sting
2.0,"color is good, but the screw came out and I  almost lost the key to my vehicle: luckily it fell inside my vehicle. kind of a waste of money, because it‚Äôs useless without the screw to hold the key."
2.0,Chain broke after 5 minutes of wearing üò©
2.0,Cheap like a gift at a carnival
2.0,Nice tie; however color was more burnt orange than gold. Had to return product.
2.0,"I have fairly large boobs, I bought a small thinking it would be perfect for a summer BBQ, ended up being super lose on my chest area! :( Material is cheap, but can‚Äôt complain to much for the price it‚Äôs listed"
2.0,"I should have know that this necklace was too good to be true. Unfortunately, the cheap price matches the quality. I wasn't expecting too much; I was hoping the necklace would look like the picture and would serve as cute costume jewelry. However the color tone does not look like the picture and the chain itself looks extremely cheap. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Didn't take more than 2 games of volleyball for them to develop holes and start to roll, come undone in the stitching and generally fall apart. Wouldn't buy again. They did ship fast and arrive quickly, otherwise I'd only give one star."
2.0,"I have asked for a return of this sweater and apparently have to wait up to 5 days for the seller to send a return label!! This sweater is as pictured except that it has gold thread woven in that I you cannot see in the picture. It also doesn't look like as high of a quality, vintage material as I thought the picture portayed. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who I thought might like it anyway. But not even a 14 yr old wants to keep it."
2.0,Okay for the price.  I won't use them but I buy them for my wife since she is death on coated lenses and I won't buy OEM lenses every couple of months to replace ones that have been all scratched up.<br /><br />Fit is excellent.  However polarization is just okay and there is pretty significant lens &#34;flare&#34; when the sun is at certain angles.  While it is not blinding it is very distracting and not something I am willing to deal with.  My wife does not seem to find either of these issues to be a problem and is perfectly happy with them.
2.0,"Not great quality, too small and just an overall &#34;awkward&#34; fit. The ears on the hood didn't stand up and it just wasn't great. Cute idea and I wish someone would make a higher quality sweater like this but... I returned it!"
2.0,I like the gray color and it fits good. Nice band. The band keeps sliding out from inside the face...wouldn‚Äôt buy again! Have almost lost my watch 3-4 times..have had it just a couple months
2.0,I love this so much! But I am very upset! Mine came with just two long strings with no clasp... So unless I tie it onto my wrist I can't wear it! Very sad about this as I was looking forward to it coming!
2.0,It is quite weird how the shorts fit perfectly and the top is so big. I'm size S in petite and I read a review saying people with size S should order large size for this item. Too much of a hassle to return so I guess I'll use only the shorts and give the top to someone.
2.0,The shape and color of the dress is pretty but the fabric is very paperlike. Doesn‚Äôt really flow well and shows all the unwanted things on the body but the shape is pretty. Just needs to update the measurements on the size chart to accommodate.
2.0,Advertised to have spring hinges which is why I bought them. They do NOT have spring hinges. Waste of time spent looking for exactly that and ordering them only to be disappointed.
2.0,I was surprised that the tie around the waist was so small. The armholes were also small. I normally were a size 12 and I ordered a 16 but still did not fit.  I had to return it.
2.0,"had several seams rip on the second wear, the belt basically fell apart. However they are very comfortable and if you were to reinforce the edges around the pockets they'll be great"
2.0,Material was very flimsy not like the first one I bought
2.0,Way too small.  I ordered an XL as a 6'2&#34; male and it didn't fit right.  The hood sat funny and I couldn't even use it.
2.0,Not as accepted :( color is way lighter and bag is not standing on its own...
2.0,The fit is ok material ok but it just looks very weird with that thing in the front....
2.0,"First of all, the it's was soo small and u can't even see the letters on it, and lastly the edge are razor sharp yeah  it almost cut me. Save ur money and get a good piece"
2.0,Can't expect more with the price.  Not too bad.
2.0,These sunglass lenses have a nice mirror finish and fit the Costa frames well. However the lenses are made of soft plastic poly material and scratch very easily. I was very unimpressed with the durability of these lenses. I would not recommend these at the price. Lenses can be purchased for under $20 that are just as good.
2.0,Picture looks good.  Quality is not. returned it.
2.0,It says fleece lined but it is not. It is very thin and runs very short. I returned it.
2.0,"Great Buy, they are beautiful."
2.0,"The seller did not include sizing information with the Vine offering and the product description did not indicate if this was one of the ""cut to fit"" belts in which the user can permanently adjust the size.  The belt is the wrong size, is not adjustable in length/size and therefore useless.<br /><br />The leather holding the post for the buckle is not centered with the top side being too long causing the post to be incorrectly angled although it is possible to close the buckle at the expense of twisting the upper section of leather holding the post.  See photo posted by GlitzAF.<br /><br />Unable to find contact information or any products from ""Daniel Marlin Pelle"" or ""Daniel Marlin"" in the Amazon search.  The former was listed in the product title but the latter is on the belt and a fabric storage bag including with the belt.<br /><br />Belt is 1.5 inches wide (3.8 cm) with the buckle measuring 2 inches wide (5.1 cm) which is the vertical dimension and 2.25 inches long (5.7 cm).  This might be a little too wide for the belt loops for some jean product lines."
2.0,"Way too heavy and the the maker should have thought to put clamp higher behind earring so would not show below the ear lobe. Like the coloring and the design of flower, wish I could wear them"
2.0,It is great but dosent open and the lights don't work uts kinda sad and upsetting.
2.0,"Okay, so. I like this dress. It‚Äôs cute and the fit is just how I wanted. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 165lbs and bought the large. I‚Äôm gonna keep it.<br /><br />BUT.<br />It‚Äôs literally missing a cuff. I guess it‚Äôs designed to have a sleeve cuff like on a ringer tee and it does. On uhh one side. The other sleeve has a totally unfinished sleeve. It‚Äôs bizarre. That‚Äôs some next level bs but I‚Äôm keeping the dress because it doesn‚Äôt appear to affect the structural integrity of the garment and no one else will probably notice but god that‚Äôs just absurd. I had to laugh. I know amazon clothes are a crapshoot but damn, y‚Äôall."
2.0,"I wore these one time and the fabric around the seams pilled, the seams themselves frayed, and it looked like they could pop open any minute. (I ran on the treadmill.) Sad because they looked good on and were good at moisture-wicking (hence 2 stars). Cheaply/poorly made. Maybe they would be okay for light yoga? I don't know. Friction doesn't seem to be their friend. Returning."
2.0,These do not look like the picture - the actual area where you put the hooks is a very thin area unlike the photo that shows a wider area.<br /><br />They look and feel cheap and awful.  First time ordering stockings online - bad idea.
2.0,"Thin material, does not protect clothing well."
2.0,"Good product, however I chose a navy onesie with orange writing, and it came but the orange is very dull, almost hard to read. Print is much smaller than expected too"
2.0,Really tiny and the posts sucked. I lost them almost immediately.
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and it still dragged the floor with wedge sandals. I had to return. If you‚Äôre really tall, cute dress."
2.0,They looked like plastic and very cheap.
2.0,This product was extremely small. Appears to be a infant size.
2.0,was not what I expected ... looked very inexpensive.  Looked better in the picture.
2.0,"Did not fit in belt loops of pants, too wide. Have to wear it as a waist belt with a dress. Not what I was looking for. The Color and quality are nice however"
2.0,"It does not conform from the waist like the picture. It just drops. Not worth the money. It's also missing a second dark blue stripe. Wow. Also, ignore my house flops lol"
2.0,the seam is in the middle of the back. most people wear them backwards with their hard hats. very uncomfortable.
2.0,It arrived on time but ran small and didn't fit well.  I hesitate to recommend this blouse.
2.0,The inner seam between legs began to split apart after one week. For a $65 bathing suit that is unacceptable.
2.0,I love this bracelet  .. one of the best ones..
2.0,"I don't want this review to dissuade someone from at least trying this if they think it will work. I have poor back muscle from overdeveloping neck muscles following a car accident and whiplash.<br /><br />I was hoping this would make my back strengthen and posture improve, but its too subtle (for me) and didn't make much of a difference."
2.0,picure looks better than the actual item
2.0,They were good but too short and they had a hole in one of the pockets
2.0,Break so easy
2.0,Very cheap and poorly designed.
2.0,"Its very nice, but unfortunately the material in kind of flimsy..."
2.0,"The shirt is SO pretty, but arrived stained and torn :/ I had to return it"
2.0,"I thought this product would be awesome so, but I definitely didn't like it. I do like how it looks, but the faux fur was somewhat brown for some odd reason like it was already dirty. The two pockets in the front are not actual pockets. They are there for looks which is unfortunate. The length in the arms and the overall length were good and fit well except the sides were just too bulky. It literally looked like I was wearing a moo moo or I was fat. Mind you I am 6'3&#34; and 185lb with a slim build and I do like my clothes slim fit, but this just wasn't for me. I asked myself if wearing this unbottoned  would help with the look, but unfortunately, it was still too big/bulky. I ordered both a medium and a large, but I was disappointed by both. I decided to return both and possibly by the actual Levis version."
2.0,It is ok for the price. U get what you pay for
2.0,"Love the quality but it wont stay clipped on to the watch! Can't use because one of the times it falls, its going to break."
2.0,Too thin not warm enough
2.0,"They worked great, but then after a few washing they started getting a little tighter and shorter. I'm pretty sure they shrunk. üòí"
2.0,Front is too heavy and the sides are too weak. difficult for my little one to hold it up. Pretty though
2.0,To be a groomers attire this lacks the apron looks nice waterproof not collects hair very annoying the material still collects hair my pockets are fur lined doesn‚Äôt wash well just disappointing spending this much on a apron to be lacking in everything a groomer would appreciate smh
2.0,"These shoes look exactly as pictured.  They are fairly comfortable.  The quality is poor.  If the return was as easy as other competitors, they would have been sent back immediately.  If I had known they were made in China, I would have never purchased them.  Amazon, you need to send the invoice with purchases so return is possible.  This is not the first purchase I've been disappointed with."
2.0,I didn't like because after i washed it looked bad.
2.0,Too dark sent back!
2.0,I love the shirt but i ordered a large and it fits like a medium. I guess the sizes run small.
2.0,Pretty dress but does not fit me.  Soft fabric though.  All three dress I bought from Amazon weeew to small.
2.0,Was expecting a little more details with the watch
2.0,Also note that these are on the larger side.
2.0,"Somewhat small. The skirt does not look anything like the one that is viewed, and the material is is not good quality."
2.0,the fabric is too light weight for the design.  It does not have enough &#34;body&#34; and kind of slips around on you.  I would be hesitant to wear this shirt out for that reason. Same observation as with the other shirt:  it needs a heavier fabric to pull off this design.  It was also too short waisted compared to the picture.
2.0,Love item<br />Poorly made.
2.0,Too bulky!  Didn‚Äôt feel cooler.
2.0,runs large .. wasn't to impressed with the shirt.  Very bulky
2.0,"The hem in the back was 4 inches shorter then the front which looked really odd and made me uncomfortable that my but might show. The dress is a gorgeous design, but the one I received was poorly put together. It was sooo disappointing."
2.0,"I would not reccomend this to hang around your neck, My son hangs it on his rear view mirror and it looks like that."
2.0,Item came later than promised. Didn't work out too well since it was ordered as a gift.
2.0,"It is made out of a very weird fabric that doesn't stretch or move at all, and runs quite small."
2.0,"These would be suitable for baby ears. Any full grown human, they‚Äôre about the size of a pinkie nail."
2.0,"I like it, but the clasps have come off and I had to glue them with gorilla glue.  It's ok now, but I could have lost it. Wish it was made a little better"
2.0,"Crap.  The entry point is so tight, can't put my hand in it and I have small hands! Best to get one with Velcro strap"
2.0,I didn't even get to wear my earring it messed up right when I was trying to put the back piece on..
2.0,"I LOVE Evil eye jewelry & I thought this would be a nice, chunky, little piece of arm candy, however when the bracelet arrive I was extremely disappointed. It's so CHEAP looking. The eyes are actually PAINTED on the beads and some aren't even painted straight. This looks cheap & I don't recommend it."
2.0,I am extremely disappointed that the writing on these masks are not in English. The image that is shown on Amazon is too small to tell if it‚Äôs in English or not so I just assumed that it was. The images of Marilyn Monroe and the material of the masks are great but the writing really has me disappointed.
2.0,"It was missing the chain and I had to go to Michael craft store to get one & spend another $10! The material was great, just disappointing!"
2.0,"pretty bad quality. stitching on the inside seams broke and came undone immediately, and the poly fabric wears badly, pills and looks bad after less than a month of wear. It is warm though thanks to Thinsulate but I would not recommend this overpriced cheap Chinese garbage  to anybody but my worst enemy."
2.0,"Put your hair in pigtails and call for Ma and Pa because this dress is so not meant for an adult. It gave no shape and looked like a potato sack. If you have a big chest or want to accentuate what you have not for you. Have a belly, not for you. Short? Definitely not for you. At 5'1"" this fell to my shins and made me look like a 12 year old girl going to sunday school."
2.0,DOOR SEAL THE SAME THING
2.0,Not as shapely as shown in the pictures.  It is a large hat for a woman with short hair.
2.0,cute!!! Nice fit seems comfortable for my toddler<br /><br />Came back to change my review. Buckle fell of he only wore it ONCE.
2.0,"It's see-through and clingy. Every lump and bump is exposed. Might be comfy, but not attractive and not worth the price"
2.0,Too big for me...
2.0,Too small in the hips and too tight in the ankles. Difficulty sitting down.
2.0,"This outfit is way too big. It‚Äôs very cute, but have to hold on to it for a while. Order a size or two smaller."
2.0,Hat came with some of the candy pieces off of the hat and loose in the bag. I am going to have to reglue them myself. You can see glue on top of the hat even where there was no candy glued. Not the quality I was expecting for the amount I paid.
2.0,Not really wide in the leg
2.0,"Not made for bigger breast ppl. I am regularly a size 4 wait, 4'11""  DD. Is not flattering if you have a bigger set. Arms are tight."
2.0,This out fit was nice it did not fit like the others. I ran very small. I am sending it back.
2.0,didn't expect it to be so small. The designs are not bad but not the best quality
2.0,[[VIDEOID:56807fb27fe233d83ab8043f8f6d0963]] I like the bracelet and the necklace and they haven't tarnished yet. I'm hoping that these items are real sterling silver
2.0,I returned it because it was too bold and the white fringe cheaper it‚Äôs appearance.
2.0,"This cover up is really pretty.... but it was tight in the arm, under arm area.  Uncomfortable.  So sadly I returned it.  The return was nice and easy as always through prime."
2.0,"While this shirt is long enough and very soft, the sizing is way off. I usually wear a comfortable Lg. This shirt hugged every roll and was see through in the XL. I could never wear it out in public. Way too tight."
2.0,Over the years I have worn 511 proper Tru spec first Tactical and others I did not expect these to fit like tactical skinny jeans...<br />The material while thin had no stretch and they were immediately given to my son
2.0,I really liked the dress. It was very comfortable and as described but I can‚Äôt wear it out and I cannot wear it to church or any events because it is completely see-through. I have to buy a dress slip or something to wear underneath it so I can wear it. Which kinda sucks. I Wouldn‚Äôt have bought it if I had read the reviews correctly and saw all the other reviews that it‚Äôs completely see-through.
2.0,"These fit okay in a size 9 in the taupe color, I usually wear an 8 or size 29 inch waist. Length is okay, I prefer longer skinny jeans (inseam perfect at 33 inches). I'm only 5' 4"", but I have a short torso and long legs for my height.<br /><br />I didn't end up keeping these because after wearing them a few times and washing once, they pilled and the knees bagged horribly. The bagging knees were the real clincher for me. they looked ridiculous after about 1/2 an hour of wear. No thanks. I wouldn't recommend them."
2.0,"They're fine, for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses. The frames are a bit flimsy."
2.0,I've purchased several of these from this company as well as other companies great idea never works expect to make a purchase every other month unless you only use it for special occasions cheap cheap cheap
2.0,Cute boots but the strap broke literally a month after having them. It was days after the return window closed. She maybe wore them less than a dozen times. So disappointed.  Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
2.0,These are even cheaper in person than I expected.  Most feel like plastic.
2.0,"Cute belt, nice quality but sized for a child. Seriously, it‚Äôs way too small."
2.0,These pants are cut as if they are for women. My husband could barely get them on in a size large. He wears a 33 in waist pants usually so these were very small. No fly either.
2.0,Not as many as advertised
2.0,Thicker than regular socks but let in more air too! Overall warmer than regular socks but not by much!
2.0,"Broke right away, just took it out of the bag!!"
2.0,looks good in picture... doesn't fit in person... its basically a bag with elastic top. not very sexy.. and super short.
2.0,"I bought two different pins. One I love and keep it on my jacket. This one seems cheaply made. When I tried it on my jacket, it spun around instead of staying put and I‚Äôm afraid the back will fall off. Not impressed. The color is good and it looks okay, but it‚Äôs definitely lower quality and now it just sits in a drawer. Bummer because I really wanted a rainbow pin!"
2.0,"The image was upside down. I didn‚Äôt send it back because I was freezing and really needed a jacket right away. After a few days, parts of the hood  started turning orange. By then I had been wearing it a lot, so I didn‚Äôt return it. It‚Äôs very comfortable, and I guess the lion is looking at me instead of everyone else."
2.0,Look good but too small
2.0,Very cheaply made. Not quality workmanship or products.
2.0,"It would be okay, but all the elastic in the lace is coming unsprung, so now the lace looks like it's hairy.  I've had it since October or so and only washed half a dozen times.  I certainly would not buy again!"
2.0,"Returning these shoes hard to put in and although cute I doubt even with one suze up they would be comfortable. The &#34;sweater&#34; part is a major pain to try to pull your feet into. Once in very cute but toe Bo's is super narrow. Boots are stiff but sturdy feeling. ,aye for some this would be a great boot but didn't work for me. Sad!!"
2.0,"I bought a medium since that is the size of all my other swim suits, however these seem a bit too small.  I wish I would have gotten a larger size.  As far as the quality, only time will tell.  At first I was impressed that these had a set of inner loops which appear to be for hanging the suit to dry.  It was a nice touch but they immediately ripped off the suit.  I probably should have returned them, but it is now too late."
2.0,Too tight. Need larger size
2.0,I ordered xxl and it‚Äôs still to small. I normally wear l-xl
2.0,Cute pants but the waist is way too small! It didn‚Äôt fit my daughter who is very thin. We had to send them back.
2.0,"Seemed to work ok but felt like the jewelry came out sticky even after washing.  It seems the container may have had a leak because after only a month, it was empty!"
2.0,"I ordered 3 pairs of 59 inch length laces. Each pair was a different length, and all were under 40 inches. While I've ordered products from China that were as advertised, these laces are not as advertised."
2.0,Fit nice but not my style. Returned it.
2.0,Not as good quality as expected but did the job
2.0,Very disappointed. These are not long like in the picture
2.0,"I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I bought it as a gift for my little sister who loves cats. The pendant itself is very cute, but the chain that it came with is a complete piece of crap! It was corroded and looked disgusting! What's worse is that it broke within a few minutes of her putting it on! Also the cat does not say ""Kiss me"" on the inside like it shows on the picture. But for the price I guess I can't complain too much, I will just have to buy her a new chain I suppose."
2.0,"My biggest problem with this dress is that it is advertised as blue, but it looks like a deep lavender. I don‚Äôt personally believe the color shown on the website is any where near what the actual color is."
2.0,"We did all the measurements and ordered the shirt that seemed like it would fit, but it was too big.  Not cut to a slim shape.  Will be returning."
2.0,Cup size is EXTREMELY small.  Band size is true to size.
2.0,"I ordered these because I wanted thigh high socks, these are not that. These cover my kneecap. I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs and am semi athletic but still have slim legs, and these socks are uncomfortably tight at the top and pinch my skin when I bend my knees.<br />I don't think anyone taller or bigger than me should buy these. I'll be returning.<br /><br />They're not anything like the picture."
2.0,"Cheap material, but looks really sexy.  Follow chart for sizing; it's pretty accurate."
2.0,"When you buy cheap, you get cheap....  They fit okay but when I bent my elbows they rolled down.  I wanted them to cover up<br />my tattoos but of course they were way to thin to cover them.  I gave them to my husband he will use them to protect his arms from the<br />sun because he has had many skin cancers."
2.0,Watch circumference was too big for my taste - quality wasn't as expected - just didn't like and returned.
2.0,"This review is for the Slytherin color option from the Enso Rings Harry Potter Collection.<br /><br />I have a few rings from Enso and I‚Äôm usually impressed by their quality and attention to design detail. In comparison, this Slytherin ring is very disappointing.<br /><br />The crest design is too small for the width of the band. I have the ring on as I type this review, my hand on my laptop keyboard, and all I see is a gray smudge. I can‚Äôt make out the detail of the crest. If I spin the ring to center a better part of the design, then I see a gray and green smudge.<br /><br />In my opinion, cutting the house crests in half horizontally wasn‚Äôt a great design decision. If they wanted to use the crests, they should have gone with a wider band."
2.0,Posts on both earrings were bent out of shape and enamel on this one was scratched off. Pretty earrings
2.0,I love the Columbia Women's Just Right II Capri so I thought I would give the Silver ridge a try.  I expected them to fit about the same.  They did not.  I have a large waist and average hips.  The waist has very little stretch.  They are huge in the hips and very long.  I was very unhappy with them and will be sending them back.  So sad.
2.0,"I found the fit and quality inferior.  I thought it would be a great deal given that I received a 50% discount in exchange for my review.  I had really wanted to give this product a good review, but couldn't in good conscience."
2.0,Appears to be larger on the website but is actually small.  My 13 year old likes it.
2.0,Item only has 1 pocket.  Not a well thought up design.
2.0,Likes. These sun glasses are fair . Could be more durable.  But another fair disposable pair of  sunglasses
2.0,Although this is a very cute print the quality is poor. the fabric is so thin I'm truly afraid after washing a few times it would rip.
2.0,"The mask is not like the one in the video and its all crooked from the jaw, and it looks like it was tried on, i received it ripped from the back or unless that how they come not sure"
2.0,"It's not the color shown in the image and there was weird, glue-like stuff on the hinge."
2.0,Very stiff. Worn about 10 times and the leather is tearing at the buckle. Looks ok for the money
2.0,The card & print was nice but the necklace itself was already slightly tarnished when it arrived. I can't give this as a gift. Highly disappointed.
2.0,"Didn't care for it.l. I returned it. Good price though, if you like this type of top!"
2.0,"The style is adorable BUT...that material!  Yuck, yuck, yuck!<br /><br />It's a course cheap polyester.  No softness.  It feels cheap and the fabric looks cheap.  I returned it.<br /><br />Also, it is not a bright, ""happy"" red as pictured.  It's more of a burgundy red (I tried to capture that in the photos and not sure I pulled it off)."
2.0,Cuts are in front not on sides. Makes the shorts look and feel weird.
2.0,Absolutely gorgeous belt. But they sent me the wrong size twice ! I had to return and was out $12 total !
2.0,Fell apart in 2 months.
2.0,Made in China very cheaply made will be returning
2.0,"The sizes for this product don't get very large unfortunately. I was hoping to wear it as a bralette over a nude/black bra, and take out the removable pads. It didn't work very well since the bra straps are a lot closer than the picture shows, they don't line up with the outside edge of my chest very well. I think this would be very nice for small chested women since they could wear it without another bra (little support by itself), or wear it with another bra as a bralette.<br /><br />TL;DR good for small chested women, pretty, comfortable, if you have a bigger chest you probably should try something else."
2.0,Super big. Hangs off of you. Doesnt look like the color shown. Much lighter. More pink. You tie own bow.
2.0,The fabric is gorgeous but runs very small<br />I ordered one size more and it fits too tight  :'(
2.0,Fits fine and I'm a 10 us women. However I read reviews and said a pair..which means 2. I only received 1....what am I gonna do with 1? Will be returning
2.0,I order an xl large wore it once and it fit great. Washed it once and I can't fit it anymore.
2.0,"In the picture you can't tell, but the silver areas are sequense. I thought it was just silver string material. It came with a pice of material to lace the corset back, which indidnt know was there.<br />It was a little overly long and had loose strings in the dress, and it smelled funny."
2.0,"Other reviews said that these skirts run small. I'm a size 0, so started with the size 4-6. It was too big, so I ordered the size 2. It appears to be exactly the same size as the 4-6. Returning both."
2.0,"The scarf is really pretty, but mine arrived with a few large holes around the trim detail. I am going to return it."
2.0,"While these socks are super cool, the top of the socks is so tight that it digs in painfully. The foot portion fits exactly as it should. There is no way to wear these, if you have normal sized calves."
2.0,"I ordered size 12-18 for my 21 month old who wears 18-24 month clothes. It was too big, so I sent it back and got the 6-12 month dress, which fit. The fabric is adorable, but the dress is thin and feels cheap"
2.0,"I was so disappointed with this dress it looked great on the model but once i tried it on the too part was way too big, there was way too much fabric towards the breast/undearm area which made it look weird"
2.0,They connect together weirdly and super hard to screw back into after put it
2.0,"Cheaply made, kind of rough and awkward shaped. Makes a pointy end and double boob shape instead of a flattering round. I regret buying this."
2.0,While the shirt fit fine (maybe a little snug in the hips but that's normal for me) what I didn't expect was a triangle shaped hemline.  The picture is misleading with the woman having her hand in her pocket.  The piece of the shirt hanging over her hand in the front is actually cut that way on the shirt and looks totally out of place and bizarre.  Returning the shirt as I'll never wear this in public.
2.0,Very thin material - looks cheap.
2.0,they fit just fine except there is a line across the thighs which I was specifically trying to avoid.  I would not have gotten them had I known because they were for dance.
2.0,"The dress itself is gorgeous and I was looking forward to wearing it.  However, the material itself wrinkles easily in transport, and it very difficult to iron.  I tried ironing it, and the wrinkles simply didn't come out of it, even using the maximum amount of steam on it.  And while trying to hold the dress in a way to get the wrinkles out while ironing, a portion of the fabric developed a hole.  Total bummer!  I was hoping to wear it as an alternative to those keyhole style dresses that are popular on Amazon.  I ended up getting a longer version of it under the Simplee brand in a deeper sky blue color."
2.0,"Cheap plastic string, which holds lens, easily broken."
2.0,"They were very comfortable and stylish and I loved the mirroring on the outside but there was also mirroring on the inside of the Lenee that caused a glare, rendering them almost unusable.  Wearing them outside at certain angles all I could see with my own face. The company was very good about responding to questions and returning these glasses but I can‚Äôt recommend these particular glasses, since they are unfit for function."
2.0,"learned a lesson, more like extra small"
2.0,It did boost up my backside... but the waist kept rolling down as the legs kept riding up... not comfortable to have to keep pulling down legs or rolling up waist...
2.0,These are perfect in all ways but<br />One. The tassels flip in all directions throughout the day. Very disappointed and trying to figure out a way to glue them because I really like them.
2.0,Item tore at the seam trashed them
2.0,The item looks great on the model...but I'm much smaller and the top of the jumpsuit was huge on me.
2.0,"Too big, makes me look like a potato."
2.0,Already gone. To fragile.
2.0,"Love the necklace, beautiful design,  but after 3 weeks of wearing it.  The color started to change, so I won't wear it anymoreüò£"
2.0,The strings for ties get tangled alot.
2.0,"Sorry, this didn't work for me to put tattoo ink into. It would have been better without the divider in the middle, which makes the cup not hold enough."
2.0,Very flimsy plastic. Not sturdy at all. Nose half fell off. Worth about $2.00
2.0,This was so tight on my toddlers head that he would rip it off right away.
2.0,These were basically a women's knee high stocking with no toe or heel reinforcement. I returned.
2.0,After washing it once it shrank at least a size and it was on the small size to begin with. Cute dress though. Should have bought larger size.
2.0,The neckline on this is really weird. The colored part is loose and wants to fold down when I wear it.
2.0,Nice looking watch but the clasp on the band is VERY difficult to use.  This is Not a good design.  Really need two people to get the watch on or off.  Otherwise the watch will fall on the floor.
2.0,it  is ok
2.0,It was too large and just did not fit as I would have liked. I gave it away.
2.0,I like the ring. But the setting had fallen off when received it.
2.0,This jacket fits small I‚Äôm normally a medium I ordered a large and it was still tight and it comes right up to the waist. Do not recommend
2.0,"I was told by my chiropractor to purchase prism glasses to help with my neck pain (while reading a book or on my phone while lying down). However, these were a bit heavier than I anticipated. After 5 minutes or so, my nose bridge will start to hurt from the weight.<br />They work like they're supposed to, but a bit more weight than I can stand comfortably."
2.0,"El mo√±o se deshizo en la segunda puesta. Son zapatos muy bonitos, el color perfecto pero de poca calidad"
2.0,"Wanted to wear as a dress, but because it's big, it's now a swim suit cover. Cute still!"
2.0,Cute but probably runs 2 sizes smaller!
2.0,I left a review a while back about how great this product was. After the 3 or 4 time washing they tare apart. I have only 2 left....
2.0,"Super cute, BUT the lining in the center just invades a certain &#34;space&#34;. If that part was different it would be perfect but it would look absolutely horrible wearing it anywhere. Plus the material is very cheap feeling"
2.0,It's a beautiful ring but the points stick into your skin and it catches on EVERYTHING.
2.0,I‚Äôll fitting. I am 5‚Äô9 and 165. I have a thick waist and thin legs. These pants are made for someone with a booty and small waist. Otherwise decent fabric. Just not cut for my body type.
2.0,"Good product but wrong item. I ordered the black tie and received a red tie. Yes, I understand I can return the product but did not feel like driving to ups."
2.0,Material is itchy/rough. Not stretchy. Runs small and wide.
2.0,Cute design but didn't wash up very well. Color faded significantly after first wash.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt meet my expectations I want to return
2.0,"The colors are just as pretty and bright as the picture. The fit is true to size. The neckline is not as low as pictured. On me it was 2-3 inches below my collar bone. The peplum is much shorter than pictured. On me it barely made it past the top of my hip. The belt is sewn into the back seam. I didn't like the way it looked when tied for 2 reasons. 1 no matter how I made the bow, it wouldn't sit straight. 2 the weight of the bow pulled the belt down in front exposing the seam at the waist which affected how the peplum layer and nit in a good way. The material has a silky feel to it but is polyester. I was getting warm just trying it on. I'll be returning this top."
2.0,The packing slip with my masks say they are made in China. Not in the USA. They seem soft but I specifically wanted masks made in the USA.
2.0,Size run very small
2.0,sizes run extremely small
2.0,"Works fine, but way too pricey for what it is and what it does. Lots of options that work as well and cost a fraction of this price"
2.0,I loved it until I went to put another a second ring on it and the clasp broke.
2.0,Silver piece in front came out quick and shirt was ruined.
2.0,A size XX-Large didn't fit an 18 inch calf
2.0,Not what I expected.  Iam disappointed .
2.0,"Smaller then I expected... backs were to loose,  both fell out within the first week. They did have a nice color to them."
2.0,"Fits small, order a size up"
2.0,"Got a hole in them first month of use, and they shrink in the dryer."
2.0,Cute but. Necklace turned brown after one wear.
2.0,"It was very cute, but I didn‚Äôt understand the need for the bow at the neckline like a bow tie when it seems to be a feminine outfit. I removed the neck bow. It was very short for the size that we purchased and kept unsnapping at the crotch when my baby is extremely petite for her age/size."
2.0,The quality of the material doesn't support how thin they are compared to other similar socks of this style I have had in the past.
2.0,Definitely more like a granny scarf then a infinity scarf but cute.
2.0,maded cheaply
2.0,Much shorter than I expected and didnt button at the shoulder as shown in the picture.
2.0,"Bought a med ,it's fits kind of big I need a small ,it's to long Im  5' 5 ,have to get it cut off at the bottom and tailored it's fits cute in the buttocks area,it's real long it can got a female like 5' 10 real good I imagine. The material it's a little cheap ,but you can play it off if you have as cute shape to start with!"
2.0,"So overall they are super warm, however the top part of the zipper cover ripped like the 2nd time I unzipped them on the side. They also are not very easy to move in. I always feel like they are going to rip when I step up into the back of my work truck."
2.0,Too small didn‚Äôt like material
2.0,Looks cheap don‚Äôt bother
2.0,"I ordered these because I liked the color and pockets.  I received the first pair and I also had a large gap that wasn't sewn together.  The stitching was present on the other side of the seam, so I know that there was an attempt to sew the entire leg.  I returned the pair for a replacement, and the second pair had the unstitched seam in the same place.  It appears that no one is inspecting the garment to insure quality leaves the building for the customer.  Not buying another one!"
2.0,"This T-bar extension does NOT work with the Shoei Neotec II quick-release strap.  The T-bar is also very cheap aluminum and can be broken easily, like other reviews have mentioned.  The carabineer is okay, the dial is easy to read, but the dial wheels feel cheap."
2.0,Very cute but way to small for the sizing that was given to order.
2.0,"I ordered silver. I got orange, and their butt ugly. Orange is the last color lens of lens I would have selected. Too much hassle to return them. Other than the color, these look to be of good build quality. I am disappointed with this order. As far as I can see, there is no indication of lens color on the outside of the box. It‚Äôs no wonder this order wasn‚Äôt right."
2.0,"its too small, doesn't feel good"
2.0,"My fault for not reading closely. Boo, me!"
2.0,Super small earrings (hard to tell with the imagine).
2.0,"I love seeing movies filmed in beautiful Cuba especially 50s circa, the 50s autos, the beautiful, sensuous dancers lke none other, the unique A frican, Caribbean music, City of Havana, etc.  This film didn't have much of a plot, history poorly researched, it was mostly about little Robert Redford driving around in a sleek 50s caddy.  I'll probably not keep it in my private DVD collection, but pass it on.  Andy Garcia has produced and started in two movies based in Cuba that are phenominal; The Lost City, an excellent historical account of an educated family and the shift from President Batista to Castro and I Love Havana, a historical account of the life of world famous trumpet musician, Arturo Sandoval friends w Dizzy Gillespie and how strictly the communists controlled the Cuban night<br />clubs.  It was an exciting adventure inside the fabulous Cuban clubs where the rich and famous frolicked.  It showed the struggle, determination and true life saga of Sandoval and his family's eventual flight to the US for freedom of belief and his willingness to work for low wages dish washing until he finally got his break and his own club in New York.  A must see if you love Cuba and it's unique people, music, dancers and classic US made vintage 50s cars."
2.0,"These did not work from the very first day that I got them. I took them to  a place that sells all kinds of batteries and the guy sold me the batteries that go into the earrings. Cost me $9.76 as the earrings took 2 batteries in each earring. I installed the earrings according to the video I got off of the computer and the earrings still did not work. I am now in the process of trying to reach Collections Etc. by phone. I have been trying for the last 10 min. and have receive nothing but a recording. So I have sent an email. We will see how that goes. I do not want my money back, I would like an exchange."
2.0,"It has sheer all over, and unless you're looking to flash people, it's not the dress for you. Also the sheer was damaged, had a hole in it. I returned it."
2.0,they are large and wierd.
2.0,Front closure was put on very crooked. I'm going to try returning it for one that is made correctly. Otherwise it's just what I needed. I did return the defective item and they replaced it promptly. The strap is much shorter than I expected. If you use it crossbody it is at your breast not your waist.
2.0,Leather was not typical Mauritius quality and styling was not great
2.0,"I bought this same dress from another vendor and loved it. But, they didn't have more colors I liked. So, I tried this vendor. The cut of the dress was odd and it did not look good on me. The color was also very faded. Disappointed & returned dress."
2.0,It came to small
2.0,The fabric was thinner than expected and the fit was slightly too small. I returned them.
2.0,The zipper has already fallen off after a couple days use.
2.0,"This pendant is much larger than I expected, which makes it look very cheap. The ""number 1"" looks like an awkward letter ""I"" or just a random piece that dangles unnecessarily in the center. It either looks like it is broken or incomplete. Very disappointed. The color is pretty (very much on the pink side) and chain is long with many size options."
2.0,"The ears are cute don‚Äôt get me wrong. However, the pair I received were coming apart at the seams on top and glitter was already rubbed off one side. I bought these as part of a birthday gift for a child. I don‚Äôt want to give her faulty cat ears, so I am returning.<br /><br />If these hadn‚Äôt of been defective they would have been really cute. Honestly, even if they had come perfect I wouldn‚Äôt see their lifespan as being very long, but the price also reflects that.<br /><br />BUT please note these have loose gold glitter like glued on. So there will be glitter fall out. That‚Äôs another aspect I didn‚Äôt like. Nobody likes to pick glitter out of a child‚Äôs hair!"
2.0,I wanted so badly to love this dress. There is a zipper on the side and it does not stay flush with the dress. It's so bunchy and very noticable that you'd have to wear a cover up with it.
2.0,Poor quality & very cheaply made
2.0,I looked forward to receiving this bracelet described as &#34;large&#34; by the seller.  I have a 7.5&#34; inch wrist and can only slide the bracelet over 4 fingers.  I suggest you indicate that this a child sized piece or reevaluate your sizes for America women.
2.0,"This is a 3 pack, NOT a 5 pack. They are comfortable but title is misleading"
2.0,tacky. looks better in picture
2.0,Watch your sizes ordered a large and got it fit like a small
2.0,Had to return the bathing suit because the cut is weird. Nice colors; poor fit. Starting the bathing suit hunt all over.
2.0,It is see thru
2.0,"I was so excited about this. The graphics are great, the reviews were great.., but the sweatshirt was terrible. Sure its soft and silky, but like plastic. If thats your thing then its great, but if you want a soft fabric that wont feel like your in a mini tent, don't buy it!!! I knew the price was too good to be true.."
2.0,I ordered this ring in gold but within a week all the gold came off and it is now a silver ring.
2.0,"It's not actually satin, it's polyester. :("
2.0,"Not excited about this dress - there's a seam that runs down the center of the ruffles in the front and the back, and it's quite apparent.  Definitely not worth the price charged."
2.0,If you buy it be careful how you wind it up. This watch did not last very long for the money.
2.0,"I used these for healthcare work. I was disappointed in them, they ripped the second week I was wearing them. I didnt even take them on and off, I had just left them on my shoe and was putting my shoe on and off."
2.0,The shirt is cute and looks like it is suppose to. Mine however was wrapped in tissue paper while the vinyl was still hot I assume. The tissue paper was stuck and melted to the letters and I tore a couple of letters trying to get it off. Returns are such a hassle I guess I‚Äôll just eat this $.
2.0,"I have found memories of my time in the Hawaiian Islands so I ordered this shirt. It is well-made and I ordered the one with buttons down the front. But, when I tried it on, it was two sizes too small! An XL is like a Medium! Too bad as I wish it had fit."
2.0,"I am surprised by the positive reviews, as I did not like this at all.  The material was strange - like athletic wear, and there wasn't really enough fabric to look 'right' when looped twice.  Even at $18, which is a lot less than other scarves with pockets, I felt like it was too much for what it is.  I returned it instantly."
2.0,"Kinda heavy in the ears, had to buy some rubber rings to go on the back to secure them on so they won‚Äôt slip out. But super cute."
2.0,Makes you look fat
2.0,"The bracelet is pretty, although small. My concern were the edges and corners seemed really sharp, as if it wasn‚Äôt finished properly. I was afraid it would slice skin and pull or tear clothing. I returned."
2.0,"These joggers seem very nice at first... The material looks similar to higher end products. Unfortunately after about a month, I had to throw my pair away. There were holes in the seams and the banding appeared to be deteriorated."
2.0,"These are cute and easy to clasp but the color is not as advertised at all. The photos shown are rose gold but the earrings in person are yellow, not even gold."
2.0,"The size is too small. I am comfortably an XL, but decided to size up just in case. Too tight on the shoulder, arm, and chest area. Later I noticed it was a women's shirt because of the fit and the location of the buttons. The fabric was also not great and the thread around the buttons were loose."
2.0,"Very thin, don't fit my toes well...and very &#34;sticky&#34; though I get that they are supposed to be non-slip, I don't think they should adhere to the mat, should they?"
2.0,"The color leaked onto the white balls, and onto my skin. The material is thin and probably the cheapest stuff around. Would not recommend, looks and feels like a cheap costume you would buy at a Halloween store. However, the price might already give this away. May be good for something you need for a day."
2.0,Very pretty but too small. I wish they would make bigger sizes
2.0,I live in Alaska and these gloves might keep your hands from freezing off at -20 but they definitely won‚Äôt keep them warm. Snow will melt right into them as well unless you pat it off your hands.
2.0,Not quite what I wanted an it's a little tight .
2.0,"In the photo, the fabric looks like soft heathery cotton but it's more rough and solid, with an off-color - more orangish than red. It's not baggy unless you buy a size or two up. It's also not as long as pictured. The model is wearing a completely different tank."
2.0,It‚Äôs cute. A little off centered. It also broke immediately
2.0,"Too small. I bought this for my 5 year old. I bought the 6-7 size. Still too small. The cuff for gloves looks like it‚Äôs inside out, not sure if they‚Äôre supposed the be folded over or not but either way the gloves are way too big, and the shirt is way too small. The hat fits nicely though. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt purchase this again. I also would not recommend it"
2.0,Sorry it's way to big. Can't remove any links to make it fit.
2.0,I like the clear case but unfortunately my IPHONE SE power plug cannot be connected without some pulling of the plastic...its easier to remove the cover but that will wear out soon. I'll try to make it last but will look for other options next time
2.0,Metal at end of belt came off. Not great quality.
2.0,"The picture is deceiving. Much smaller than I anticipated. For reference, actual size is a little larger than a pinhead. If you're looking for something subtle, this could be a good option, but for me, it was a disappointment. The construction is the redeeming factor. The metal didn't cause a reaction and isn't prone to bending."
2.0,Got these to wear as a nose ring and ended up trying to wear them as earrings. They are not well made and they are very hard to clasp. One of mine would close but the other one was so deformed that even out of my ear I couldn't close it. Would not buy again.
2.0,"I wouldn't advise buying this shirt. It's like it's sewn inside out on half of it, but after looking at the pictures I guess that's how it's supposed to be? Weird. I wish I had looked closer at the pictures before buying.<br /><br />I only gave this 2 stars because the material is wearable and it would be really cute without the weird sewing/stitching."
2.0,"I was happy to receive the shirt, but will never wear it because the logo is not centered. So frustrating. I made the mistake of washing it, so I‚Äôll just take the loss.<br /><br />The shirt fit fine and has good coloring"
2.0,I am a size 6 and most pants. These are a little baggie and the legs flared out like a pair of old lady culottes. I‚Äôm not young but I‚Äôm not ready for that yet!
2.0,The material is extremely thin and cheap. I‚Äôve had tops like this before with better/thicker material that squeeze the girls nicely in a size small. The small for this (I am a 32DD) was way too big so it didn‚Äôt sit on me nicely and the material kind of bunches. And the picture makes it look like thicker material than it is. A paper cut would tear this open. Overall not the worst thing ever but wouldn‚Äôt really trust this to wear out.
2.0,Loved the style but seller should have mentioned how sheer it is.
2.0,"I ordered an adult wig. The item I received doesn't even fit my 10 year old and she looks like Sebastian Bach in it and it's hard to hide her hair with it. But seeing as Halloween is a couple of days away, we need to make it work."
2.0,Shorts ran a little on the small side.
2.0,"These run small and are see through, so be careful. Order a size larger and panties."
2.0,These shorts fit ok but are on the smaller side. They are also not worth more than just to wear around the house. They are pretty see through so I was disappointed in them.
2.0,The clamp doesn't stay closed.
2.0,These are really cute shorts unfortunately they were also HUGE! I bought an XS for my daughter and she tried them on and they fit like mens basketball shorts. I tried them on and they fit me and I wear a M/L. Had to return
2.0,I really wanted to LOVE this bag. The bag itself it AWESOME. I love the size and the burgundy color. However like reviews have stated there is an awful smell to the purse. I tried airing it out hoping it would pass. Sadly it did not. I will be returning it.
2.0,Read other reviews and thought the size would be right but I think it‚Äôs a little small for size 3x
2.0,This tunic isn't worth the $17.99.  straight from China and the color is very misleading.  I ordered the blue/green and there is definitely no hint of blue in this.  It's more forest green or combat green.  The material is very thin and the stitching is crooked :(
2.0,It's not as nice as the picture and definitely not worth 65 bucks.
2.0,"Poor quality, buttons don't line up with button holes. shorter than pictured. Wouldn't purchase again."
2.0,The first time I wore it the cuff of the sleeve unraveled
2.0,It is very very big (wide & chunky) for a women size watch. And I'm not a small woman. I just don't feel good when I wear it. It could be better if it's smaller and thinner
2.0,Would fit great if I was 4&#34; taller. Way too much fabric through the middle. The cups were way too high.
2.0,Very tiny. Still cute
2.0,This was just not for my daughter. She did not like the look of the material.
2.0,the pieces are nice but the seller did not provide a EGL Certificate  like he promised
2.0,Shoes were cute but had to return them as they were too large
2.0,For an xxl it was REALLY small. Have to send it back. But otherwise cute and plush.
2.0,good ring but it‚Äôs missing a letter üòê
2.0,Purchased this for my wife for her birthday. After about a two months the carrying handles are coming apart and the hinge pins keep coming out.
2.0,"It's super cute, but more of a costume material."
2.0,"everything you see online with a Chinese girl wearing is 90% not your size or/and bad quality, i learn that shopping on Aliexpress and others Chinese sites, they look good and price is usually too good to be true. be aware on buying from them."
2.0,"I am a C Cup and ordered a C Cup.  When it arrived, I had to give it to my teenage daughter to wear."
2.0,She finds that her pony tail height just isn't workable for her while wearing this
2.0,"How does one be extremely fair in a review. The company sent us the gloves all the way from China. Aside from a few yarn pulls they were lovely gloves but needed to be returned to a CA address. These gloves are for children or I have to imagine extremely petite hands. They seemed warm inside but were so tight they they could not fit any female hand in our home and we have small to medium sized hands with slim fingers.<br /><br />I did not need gloves for their touchscreen feature but I imagine my daughter in college might have used it very occasionally. The time of delivery was well beyond 10 days which is to be expected with an international purchase.<br />What I find so very strange is that so many reviews and one has to assume written by adults, give these gloves five stars. If they were being described as gloves for children (the colors certainly have that suggestion of gaiety), then they would have earned 5 stars.<br />I was not reimbursed for the cost of sending them back to CA and did not bother to dispute this.<br />A thought that if these gloves are for the cosy comfort of young children as they should be, children should be playing without concerns for technology. I have very small 6&#34; circumference wrists and the wrist bands were very snug. Alas, I had to give this product only two stars for deception in advertising.<br />Grateful always for the incredible service of Amazon."
2.0,Earrings are light weight and pretty however they bend easily and I had a stone fall out.  Good for the occasional special wear may not be able to withstand being put on and off on a daily basis which is what I used them for.
2.0,Just an awkward fit. Pointy shoulders and maybe not for someone who is shorter.  Fabric is just above costume material.  Fairly thick.  But I only spent $11 so I can't complain.
2.0,"Watch works okay, just a little smaller than expected with a short strap."
2.0,"I did a previous review. The shirt is very small, and does not fit like the picture at all. I did contact the seller, and they were accommodating and did what they could to help me. I do appreciate that. Wish the shirt was bigger."
2.0,Side of the dress was separated at the seam about 2-3 inches so now have to sew itüòè
2.0,Dress is a tad bit bigger than actual size. The necklace was broken in half and the gloves are not one size fits all.
2.0,"I got this product about a month ago on October 8th. It seemed alright when it first arrived. I have worn each item only about 4 or 5 times since. Now on November 8th, the left thumb (my primary thumb) has stopped working on my phone's screen, and a few threads have started to come loose. I cannot even return it anymore as the last day for that was on November 7th..."
2.0,"A bit too thick for comfort, and difficult to snap into place."
2.0,I was so excited to try this jacket. Too bad it did not fit at all. Lucky my sister that fits her perfectly. She is a size 12 and a size XL looked good on her. Very light and cute but the size is way offf üòîüòí
2.0,I like this dress but after one wear I found a hole on the side at the waist. Pretty disappointing. Wish I found it before I wore it and washed it.<br />It is very comfortable and the pockets are convenient.
2.0,So thin you can blow a match through it. Needs heavier material
2.0,"These are pretty and comfortable, but the cups run small. If you compare to VS braettes, you‚Äôll need 1-2 sizes up. Unfortunately, the band may be too big then."
2.0,Cute outfit but I ordered a size up (9 month) the pants are way to big (they fit my firends 2 year old) and the shirt barely fits my 4 month old.
2.0,These are very small in the waist and very large in the hips.
2.0,"So the dress that came is not the dress I ordered. No time to send back, but luckily the dress that was sent fits and looks ok on. Husband likes but not the dress that was ordered besides the color. Good material"
2.0,It seems to run a little small in the chest/arms. Weird clingy material. Wouldn‚Äôt purchase again. Pick a different dress!
2.0,"The strings come undone and the stitching closest to armpit was so uncomfortable that I couldn‚Äôt wear it. Gave me a rash. I‚Äôm a 32 c. Maybe would work better for someone with a lower bust, mine sits quite high. Quality seemed nice tho."
2.0,"Nice shirt but sizing is way off, very small size almost as small as a medium"
2.0,"I don‚Äôt know if my ears are too high or too low but the fit of this Bun gaiter is very uncomfortable on me. There is too much material above the ear opening. Because of this, that material bunches up on top of my ears and also pulls them forward. The gaiter has a straight cut edge and it keeps rising into my eyeballs. Even my glasses won‚Äôt stop it from creeping up so I‚Äôm constantly pulling it downward. The gaiter is also tight across my lips. When I try to speak it just gets sucked into my mouth."
2.0,"The sleeves were too large. Like, yes, the body is bigger, but the arms don‚Äôt need to get proportionately bigger as well! The style was similar to the picture, but also just...off. It looked like a copy cat. I didn‚Äôt want to spend my hard earned money on it so i returned it."
2.0,Does definitely not run true to size. Whatever size you normally order you better go two sizes  up. Seller won‚Äôt pay shipping for returns and the cost to return it is higher than the purchase price of the item because it‚Äôs going to Canada. Buyer beware!
2.0,I have had my watch for two days and have ne of the wood pieces fell out of the band very disappointing I have other boho watches this have never happened was going to buy another but think I will look for another company
2.0,I literally made a point to buy a 5x because whenever I get any clothing from Asian companies the stuff is TINY! The 5x fits like a regular XL. Was very very disappointed.
2.0,Soft and light and comfortable.<br />BUT No layers for protection if you are looking for Covid virus cough/sneeze droplet reduction.<br />We got these for twin 10 year old granddaughters and will use them only for emergency nose/mouth coverage if they forget their more protective masks.
2.0,Dislike because it has issues.  Celsius thermometer instead of Fahrenheit.  Altimeter and barometer need to be separate. Need a version for the US.
2.0,"These gloves are very flimsy and tear easily. Not all tear to this extent but overall they're very unsatisfactory. I don't ask a lot of them (applying thyroid cream to my cat's ear), so I can make do.  But I won't purchase again."
2.0,I ordered one on accident when the next order came it was green absolutely nothing like the first one
2.0,"Cute, but not easy for a 3-4 yr old to walk-in, wished the had a heel strap"
2.0,My wife is petite and I ordered small and from the chart the small fits all her measurements but when we received it is fits more like a Medium or Large.  Its not a small according to standards even their own chart.
2.0,Love the style but the fit was too tight for my big head.  Wish there was an extra large for me.
2.0,They are okay plugs. Size 0 is too small to really see any detail of the image though
2.0,"These are a strange fabric. They have very little stretch and it is not a smooth texture. The seams pilled after one wear. The waistband is a 2"" piece of elastic sewn into the top of the band. It rolls and twists and is uncomfortable. These are not activewear - they do not stay up and they prohibit movement. The fabric and construction is really cheap."
2.0,Cheaply made broke soon after he started playing with it
2.0,"Dont waste your time or money as I did. They are light weight, but they are really ugly."
2.0,"These pants look amazing! I wish they fit and had flexibility to move around in them, but they don't! The looks will blow you away, they look like ""tactical"" wear but you won't be able to move around in them.  My crotch was squeezed so tight I had to take them off after 5 minutes, my athletic thighs also barely fit in them.  These pants are built for ""regular size"" men.  If you work out at all and have above average thighs or crotch you won't fit in these pants, much less be able to move around in them.  it's ashamed because they look great but don't buy them unless your average man that has no problem fitting into ""off the rack"" clothing.  For those of us athletic {38""W, 21""arms, 54"" chest, 29"" thighs} that's it's already difficult finding comfortable clothes to wear you need to pass this up!  To bad, they look amazing! have I already mentioned that..."
2.0,Not the best quality. The white lace at the bottom had theeada already coming in out. Sadly had to return
2.0,It‚Äùs huge
2.0,This homage looks great but my copy had a defective crown.  Returned it.
2.0,"I bought this primarily as a cheap, and LIGHT bit of rain protection for a 3-week trip to Europe. The handle fell off the first time I opened it--in my home before. For this, I'd give it a 1, but I modified the handle a touch in my workshop, and it held up fine through a handful of storms on the trip. Thus, I give it a 2."
2.0,After one use they fell apart. Gave two stars because designs are cute.
2.0,Poor quality of fabric....cheaply made...decided to return it.
2.0,"I liked the material and the dress, but it just didn't lay well across the shoulders and neck for me.  The small V in the neck didn't seem to lay flat, and it seemed I really had to pull the shoulders out wide to get them to lay down.  I decided to return it."
2.0,These socks were a picture of Darnell Nurse. Not even closely resembles McDavid
2.0,Like 2-3 sizes too small.
2.0,Really comfortable but picks up every piece of fuzz or lint in a mile radius. I can wear them around the house but no chance of wearing in public
2.0,I ordered a small. It's pretty big for a small
2.0,A very large watch.  Does not keep good time.  How is this possible with a quartz movement?<br />Looks like something you‚Äôd buy from a street vendor out of his back seat.
2.0,The size is too small size 6 it‚Äôs like size 5
2.0,They look awesome but the crotch area was not big enough for me. The pouch needs to be bigger.
2.0,Returned as it was too small in the chest area but that fabric was perfect wor work and it was suitably dressy with leggings.
2.0,I should have look at the material and realize polyester is hot in summer. I thought it was cotton.
2.0,Dress if very thin fabric. Not at all what I was expecting. Runs large
2.0,LOOK VERY PLASTIC
2.0,It's cheaply made the material used isn't great and it's not that it doesn't fit but it's awkward in the bust area
2.0,[[VIDEOID:375d2c64918cbf0b883b3cad4ac6e657]] When we first got it for my son it had all the noises and worked perfectly. But after 5 minutes it doesn‚Äôt open by itself anymore or close by it‚Äôs self and some noises don‚Äôt happen or it happens when no one is using it. My son absolutely loves Ghostbusters and this really disappointed him and myself.
2.0,"This costume is adorable. When I received it, I received a size Large. This was not written into the item descriptions. You see, this is a problem for me because I am 5‚Äô0‚Äù, female, and of small stature at 120lbs.<br />I pulled the costume out and surely enough, it was way to big. A bummer.<br />(We all have our own reasons as to why we want this costume)<br />I cannot rate the quality, but only say that it was too large. I returned it."
2.0,"Cute, but way too small for my nostril :/"
2.0,Can cause hair bumps due to the tightness of the stretch materials.
2.0,"I would order the next size up. The neck hole is snug so don't put make up on before or do your hair before unless it's straight. It's not black either, it's dark grey. It's alright but I would have to loose More weight to wear it comfortably"
2.0,Can‚Äôt wear not big enough in leg holes
2.0,padding is too thin to be useful. Extra padded nose piece would rate 5stars.
2.0,"The dark gray was way smaller and not as stretchy as the others. My child can not wear it because it doesn‚Äôt even fit over his head.  The other 3 were fine.  We‚Äôve already washed them and he‚Äôs worn the other 3 of them so I can‚Äôt return now, but if we need more I won‚Äôt order these. The price is great, if all 4 are the same size and can actually be worn.  They are soft and breathable, just inconsistent sizing."
2.0,Well it‚Äôs basically a long tube top. No cut to it at all. Just going to use it as a beach cover up. It‚Äôs to short to wear as a dress and I‚Äôm 5 ft tall 115 lbs I ordered a medium. Not worth the price some cotton and elastic.
2.0,"The mask looks nice, but the little ear adjusters aren‚Äôt all the way on, so you can‚Äôt use them. The length of the mask from nose to chin is really short, so you can‚Äôt open your mouth at all because it slips over your chin. I‚Äôm very disappointed in this purchase"
2.0,Very cheap. Not nearly as vibrant in color.
2.0,"Doesn't fit well on big heads. Mine is 23inches, hat size (7.25, L - XL). Very tight and uncomfortable."
2.0,Fits small and is cheap looking
2.0,"Cheap! Runs small, short, and material is paper thin. See through."
2.0,"I bought this for my flowergirl but after she tried it on, it just looked CHEAP! It was so cheaply made that I couldnt let her wear this dress. I had to return it! On the website, it looks so pretty, in person, it looks like something someone threw together real quick. The appliques on the back were glued on, the train  just didnt lay right. This would make a decent costume, but if you are looking for something for a special day, dont buy!!"
2.0,I love satin and can only sleep in satin. Unfortunately the neckline is so uncomfortable that I can't wear this nightshirt.
2.0,"These were very baggy in the legs, but fit at the waist. Didn‚Äôt feel like softball pants when wearing- felt more like dress casual capri pants. Probably won‚Äôt use for softball."
2.0,The post name off the first time I wore it.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt complement curvy shaped women.
2.0,stones dropped out  first wearing
2.0,"Not for me, the pix looks better, it was too big,  i am 5'7 175 lbs with the banana shape"
2.0,"It's cute, but I don't know who it was designed to fit. I wear a 11/12 and went with the large since it supposedly fits up to a 14. I could hardly believe the tags on what I received. The tags say L, but it's definitely more of a small. And I cannot imagine anyone with larger than a B cup fitting into the top. I had my brother's girlfriend, who wears an average 9/10 and is smaller chested, and even she didn't fit comfortably in it. I laid out my size L bikini from last year and even that one looks 2 sizes larger than the Angel Secret. If you are considering this suit, I'd definitely recommend going 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear. It's really cute, if you can discern the proper size.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest."
2.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01L0PH96Q/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15<br />Not comfortable and too large
2.0,"It was small. I only wear a size 8. It shrank after washing and air drying. So now it doesn't even loop through my heel properly, and thus keeps slipping off. Th material was great though, not like nylons. If you have smaller feet, it could work for you."
2.0,Cute but runs way big
2.0,There cheap you can defiantly tell. But they did fit inside my Oakley sunglasses but I will not be using them. The other thing I noticed was I ordered polarized which these where not
2.0,Looks super cheap. Can see straight through it. Will need to wear a second dress underneath.
2.0,"Looks and feels nice, but pocket seams tear too easily<br /><br />Edit: zipper broke"
2.0,"I want to like this top, ....however there is a ‚Äúbut‚Äù. This top is light weight and very much like a soft T-shirt material, so thinner than a sweatshirt, which I can make work, but the green to grey coloring is basically printed on a white shirt. It does run small so order 2 sizes larger, as it fits snug and not like the picture. I will make it work for things around the house."
2.0,Runs small and low cut
2.0,These are not sneakers to last. Less than a month and the sides of my son's sneakers are falling apart.
2.0,"First, I‚Äôm not sure how much is merino wool. It doesn‚Äôt feel like any merino wool jacket I have had before. Also, the sleeves are starting to pill-up. This is definitely not the same quality as Ice Breaker or Ibex or Smart wool. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it."
2.0,"I love the different pendants, but as other people have said it is almost impossible to get the charms off the chain to switch them, the rings are too small. That is a poor design for a necklace that is supposed to be interchangeable. I might just go buy a different chain. I should have read the other reviews first!"
2.0,"Really cute, excited to use but one of the body strap clips broke the first day I used it."
2.0,"These are a rather cheap plastic, they do block the India from your face however they also fog up quite a bit on occasion."
2.0,"I thought these were really comfortable and don't leak, but I couldn't see much. The optics were rather poor and distorted, and they fogged up pretty badly while brand new. Usually the anti-fog wears off after a while, with these it's like it was never there. I returned them."
2.0,"Cute idea, but too small and itchy. I would not recommend this item ."
2.0,"I purchsed this backpack to replace my current JanSport Right Pack, whose zippers, after fifteen years of continual use, finally had become unreliable.  Already, I can see that the new product is not nearly as well constructed, and modifications in design, although apparently minor, significantly dimish the internal load capacity.  I do not anticipate this item lasting until 2037!<br /><br />Alas, even JanSport. . ."
2.0,Even washed in cold  water- but black faded into white
2.0,"They are for sure cUte, but some of them have different elastic and they roll down a lot."
2.0,"The way the top is designed made me look like I had shoulders of a football player! I love the colors, but that look just did not convince me enough to keep it! The quality was nice for the price, though."
2.0,They are pretty but feel very cheaply made I really don't expect them to last very long but we shall see
2.0,Look cheap. Material smells HORRIBLE. Not what I thought
2.0,"The pendant is great, but the &#34;cord&#34; provided for it is Horrible! I had to throw away the cord because it feels like a plastic and is very stiff. The pendent didn't fit right on the pendant. I still have been unable to wear the pendant considering that I have to find a necklace/cord. The pendant is beautiful and very shiny which I do love."
2.0,"Looks great, but broke the very first time my wife wore it, within a few hours even. We'll try to sodder it back together. Very disappointing. I should have heeded the other reviews that said the same thing."
2.0,"Sorry too small and too late to return, wasted my $$"
2.0,Product did not fit at all..  Not satisfied or happy with my product.
2.0,"Too big and long for me, and heavy. I should order large instead of extra large."
2.0,"I purchased this item in hopes of a more fashionable option to the rubber bands. Although it is cute and a great idea, I am returning it today because the strap is very uncomfortable (scratchy) and the compartment where the Fitbit sits in is too large; causing it to shake and bounce around all day. I am afraid it would eventually cause damage to the Fitbit if I wore it while it bumped into the metal all day long."
2.0,Looks cheaper in person and smaller than expected in the shoulders/bust.
2.0,"Edit 2020: Now the seller is using my pictures, which can be subject to copyright (MY PICTURES!)to promote this locket. Listen if you have any sense what so ever do not spend half a hundred dollars on this item. As you can tell by my more recent picture (because I deleted the originals) This locket has rusted it's no longer a Siver color its not a rose gold color that is not pleasing to the eye. I got this locket back in December/ January and it only took two weeks for it to rust ( i didn't have it in water nor did I wear it on rainy days, (I'm very careful with my jewelry) Like I stated back that this isn't really the official locket its a fake. You're much better off buying the h2o locket from atochi or from esty both sellers have beautiful h2o lockets that I have since May/July 2019 that hasn't rusted and both are made with sterling silver .925. The atochi h2o locket isn't official but closely resembles the show and it has bubbles inside (I have the original one that without bubbles but it's still beautiful and has rusted like this) The lockets are pricey but I would think buyer from this seller!<br /><br />The reason I brought this locket was because the show was a favorite of mind as a child. Now that I have my own money I decided to buy. The issue is is that the locket bubbles inside the locket look nothing like the ones in there picture they promote and the Jem makes the locket look cheap! The pictures of the mermaids they give don‚Äôt even fit in the locket Suggesting that the package is original but not the locket. The pictures are clearly for a different version of the locket. Don‚Äôt buy this German Verison I would definitely suggest to buy the locket that‚Äôs straight from the United Kingdom. Oh and the pouch they give you feels like paper. The waves on the back are not like their pictures either. I‚Äôm highly disgusted with this locket!"
2.0,They are too bright for my shoes.
2.0,fit is not flattering fit at all...you'd have to be tall and thin to pull off these pants....
2.0,Very hard material. Not comfortable.
2.0,Loved how light these earrings are. But post that goes through ear is too flimsy. It broke off after approximately 6 weeks....
2.0,"This costume is absolutely adorable, but SO small. Bought the size small for my 20 year old who always wears a small, 5‚Äô5 and 120 pounds. The elastic around the arms was strangling her tiny little twig arms‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt imagine who has smaller arms than her who this could possibly fit! Also, the entire thing was just super short. Not like I‚Äôm just old and think skirts should be long, I mean like not long enough to cover my 5‚Äô5‚Äô‚Äô kid‚Äôs bum even if she is just standing still. We bought a black petticoat for her to wear underneath and give an extra 2 inches in length. It was super cute with the extra black ruffle hanging down, but I would have preferred for the dress to actually fit without buying an extra piece. Also, it‚Äôs not just the skirt that is too short, the waist is really high, like the entire dress is made for a kid and not an adult. The entire thing just looked way too small. It‚Äôs super cute, but order at least two sizes up. Also, don‚Äôt go by the size chart included in the post, according to those measurements my kid should have needed an XS, so I thought ordering the small was sizing up, but apparently she needed at least a medium, possibly a large."
2.0,Soft but large and shapeless. I returned
2.0,These earrings are cute and arrived exactly as pictured. The reason for the low rating is they constantly flipped around backwards so the beaded part faced my neck instead of being on the outside. No matter how many times I flipped them around they always flipped backwards. I just never wear them so it was pretty much a waste of money. I bought a pair for my sister at the same time and hers do the exact same thing.
2.0,Would have been great but it ran HUGE!
2.0,Very pretty but center stone fell out as soon as I opened the package and needed to be glued in.
2.0,Product is made very well but I have it a low rating because it doesn‚Äôt fit to size I‚Äôm an XL in my shirts and I ordered an XL and it‚Äôs to small I would order a size above your regular size
2.0,The fit squeezes thighs in a weird way that isn't cute. Unless you have small legs it might not work out for you. Some of the color combinations aren't very cute but that's something the buyer should know before purchasing anyways.
2.0,"Not nearly as delicate and beautiful as it looks in the picture. In real life its very big and clunky. Also, shipping takes forever! I do think it's worth the price though, as long as you know what to expect."
2.0,"The glasses are pretty, but that extra thick section at the bottom makes it HARD to focus! I would not recommend these glasses for reading  or anything else that requires you to focus."
2.0,The grip glue wore out after a year of moderate use.
2.0,I recieved what i thought was a good deal and for th most part it was....... But when tightening the barclamps they stripped the hex screw and Now i cant get 2 of the screws out of 2 clamps Luckaly the kit came with 8 of these and I replaced the carbon screws with Stainless Steel. The black carbpn screws are cheep and the 1st time I attemped to tightened up the hex stripped. This would have gotten a 4star + if this didnt happen..... Buyer beware replace the screws dont use them or your bar clamps will become paperweights.
2.0,"Totally see through... I got the white and it's more ivory than white, but still very see through"
2.0,"Not the worst socks, but not the best either. The elastic isn't very robust so the socks were all slouching the first time I wore them and the seam on the toe was pretty messy. They'll probably fall apart sooner rather than later. I'll wear them to work and see how they hold up."
2.0,"Thin leather.  Offers no real ""protection"".<br />Disproportionate.  Seems to be made for women.  Belt is waaaay up high."
2.0,The backs are way to short
2.0,The reason why any one would buy custom/specialized cufflinks/anything is becuase they want it looking better than normal.<br /><br />The look is disappointing. Not exquisit just plain finishing. I almost thought it was a product defect then I compared it to the picture; that is not an illusion but that is exactly how the cufflinks look; so the logo is distorted even below the &#34;clear/see-through&#34; matterial.<br /><br />Cufflinks are suppoed to look good! Outstanding! Excellent! Impressive.... you know?
2.0,Don't look like the picture.  The ones I received have a matte finish and different shape.
2.0,"it snaps open so quickly. It's heavy and the first time I wore it it broke in 2 pieces. Do not recommend, will not purchase again."
2.0,"Not good quality control, opened the box and found the stitching near the ankle is slightly open. If I start to wear the opening will expand. I needed the boots in a hurry and paid extra for expedited shipment, bit disappointed ."
2.0,The material was not what I was expecting.  I kind of felt like a bathing suit.
2.0,"A bit disappointed to be honest.. I am a preschool/ home montessori teacher, and have been eyeing Sarah's silks for quite a while, but haven't been able to make a big investment until recently selling off all of our  kids non-open ended toys to purchase some better options. I was so excited to finally try these out! I was planning on purchasing 2 sets of &#34;seconds&#34; to save a little, and get the best variety, but thought I would invest in one &#34;good&#34; one first, just to be sure the materials were what I was hoping for. I'm sad to say I will not be purchasing anymore, as this play silk came with a unraveled hem, and loose thread (basically what I would have expected as a &#34;second&#34;) maybe this isn't a normal thing to happen, but was very disappointing."
2.0,Ugly Frog and other Chinese sellers are not worth it for American buyers. Sizes are always inconsistent and usually take a month or longer to arrive.
2.0,"I loves the fit of this suit but after fairly sporadic use the bottoms developed a see-through patch right in the middle of the butt, making them unusable."
2.0,I expected this to be a lightweight dress. It is not the same dress as the picture. It‚Äôs very heavy and nasty material. Nothing like I expected.
2.0,UPDATE:<br />I wore this skirt all of twice before the zipper broke. I either have to buy a whole new skirt or learn to sew a new zipper in. Very dissapointing especially since I bought multiple colors. Hopefully those last longer.<br /><br />I love this skirt I literally bought it in 3 other colors. It's thick quality material. The inside skirt part is a bit unless as it's baggy wide legs wouldn't cover much. That was fine for me I was planning to cut that part out anyway. But read other reviews for sizing. And especially measure yourself and check. I ordered my regular size and it was too small. It stretches so technically it fit but the top of the pleats look terrible when they're stretched. It's much better in the next size up
2.0,"Should‚Äôve known for the price that it would be cheaply made, and it is (loose threads, seams not sewed down, feel of fabric, etc.).  Definitely runs small.  And there is a zipper in the back. It‚Äôs going right back to Amazon!"
2.0,Fabric feels good. But they do ride up.
2.0,Hated how the dress looked on me. Was not what I expected. The material is also not what I expected. I wouldn't wear this dress. I give it a fail
2.0,This dress made my boobs look great but it did not work for me around the tummy. I am 5‚Äô2 and 124 pounds and it made me look so fat. The pockets stick out and gap open and the waist is placed  in an awkward spot. I returned it because it just didn‚Äôt look right.
2.0,needs to be a less stiffer fabric and better ears
2.0,TO MUCH BAND .
2.0,it was not the right size and it was very disappointing I would not recommend this at all
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:fb08158a7c34d9c9431f6cb4a245782b]] It‚Äôs a very cute band up til the print wears off. It‚Äôs a great flexible band, like it better than the apple Original band that the watch comes with."
2.0,I really liked this bag but the zipper broke not too long after I bought it. I donated it and bought a different bag. I really liked the color though. In the end I wish I bought a different bag.
2.0,"top was ok, the bottoms were too small"
2.0,"Material less than durable. Kept band as a backup, guess got what I paid for. It does look good."
2.0,"My granddaughter birthday. She didn‚Äôt wear a birthday dress, because the dress ran too small.."
2.0,Order a size smaller than you normally would
2.0,"If you are bigger than a US Large, then do not buy. I am a Large/XL, I bought this is XXL and it was too small"
2.0,"though it said large it was too small,  so i gave it to my daughter."
2.0,Pic gives the appearance the item is larger than it actually is.
2.0,"I loved this band and had no complaints, but it just broke today. I received it on April 16 and the clasp just broke. Super disappointed."
2.0,All it took was one day for this cheap elastic band to break. So disappointed.
2.0,"They do seem to run on the small side. I received three black, two shades of grey, and a blue hat. I would have returned them for this reason if I hadn't needed them for a Christmas gift."
2.0,I'm a small and bought the medium for a friend's birthday. I tried it on and it was too small for me.
2.0,Backpack was really small. Had to use as an on the rush diaper bag. My daughter is in the 5th grade. None of her books fit in it.
2.0,"I gave 2‚≠ê only because they are cute, but so disappointed I won't get to wear because of the strap there is no way to wear these sandals because these don't have a way to connect like most sandals do, 1 side looks normal & the other has a crazy hook, I'm like where does this belong to you can't hook it to stay on it doesn't make sense! & If this review doesn't make sense to you this is exactly how you'll feel if you buy these sandals, plus they were to smallüåπupdate they have kindly refunded my full refund, they may have just been this pair that I'm not sure, but you can depend on them to take care of you if this should happenüåπ"
2.0,Fit is great but material is not so good. Corners of the skort curl up - which defeats the style of this skort.
2.0,"Horrible product. Quality was very poor, has no support or shape."
2.0,I‚Äôm a size 9 and a 9 was way too small
2.0,"The belt is cute, but it broke after one wear.‚òπÔ∏è"
2.0,"What I received is not an 18mm band. It looks all right, but it is too big for the Timex watch I own. I measured the band with a metal ruler and also compared it to others that I know are 18mm (including an 18mm band still in the box) and it is definitely 2mm wider. Other reviewers apparently received the correct size, but be aware that, if you expect an 18mm, you may or may not receive that size."
2.0,Pretty but she lost it the first day
2.0,If you want to throw your money away? Buy these!!! They just don't work. Wanted them for my sun glasses and it just made everything blurry and  they didn't adhere well at all....
2.0,"The length and gauge of these were great! But the balls/ designs on the end were very large and bulky and looked terrible on like they were trying to take over my ears. The owl doesn‚Äôt move, and I was hoping to combine it with the silver and blue arrow, but only one end of the arrow screws off so I was not able to do that. The only pieces of this pack that were of normal size that I will be using is the plain silver and the plain black."
2.0,"I ordered an adult small for my daughter for an upcoming wedding, this is super large and wide but the tie straps will fix that with a bow in the back. But this dress is extremely long for a small. I'm I will have to get this hemmed up."
2.0,The underwire is too strong it hurts your chest it's very uncomfortable. I would return but don't want to go through the hassle.<br />The two stars is for the beauty when u look at it from first sight. But wear it after say three hours and you want to take it off ASAP
2.0,"I wish before I ordered the shoes I had seen the other 2-star review, with which I couldn't agree more. I ordered my size, and the size of the shoes feels true. However, it's the material and craftsmanship of that make the shoes uncomfortable. Discomfort aside, the heel is in my view lower than the picture looks. It's almost flat."
2.0,"I liked the feel of the fabric as it felt soft, but was disappointed to find a black ink mark on the front of the dress (see pictures) and it is a little see through so I will have to find a slip to wear underneath. The pictures don‚Äôt look as bad as in person. Thankfully, I am having my students color and write on it so that I can wear it to graduation (I am a student teacher currently) so the dot won‚Äôt be as noticeable after that. Unfortunately, I will have to spend more money to make it work for graduation due to it being somewhat see through. It isn‚Äôt the most flattering dress and I bought based off of customer reviews with high hopes in the quality. Hoping I can make it work in time, but as of now, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. I got an L and it‚Äôs a little unflattering, but I think a slip will help. Would maybe consider getting an XL if I got again. I typically am a size 10-14 depending on the fabric and brand."
2.0,I need to return them. I ordered a size 10 which is true of every pair of shoes in my closet but these are very large. Need to return them for a full size smaller. Company sends a packing slip that says they do not do exchanges so I have to return and order new. Kind of a pain
2.0,"This is basically the same bracelet but it doesn't look as good as the photo.  Basically looks like thin straps of cord - the beads, etc. don't stand out at all.  Definitely not worth the price."
2.0,Quality not as good as I expected....made rather cheaply.
2.0,Disappointed the quality not too my expectations
2.0,Item came folded and could never get the fold out so the hat had a fold visible on in the rim. Didn‚Äôt use. Cheap material.
2.0,Better to write dimensions it is small :(
2.0,The fit was fine but wont be buying more as they snagged on a hangnail the third time I wore them and got a run like nylons.
2.0,The picture and colors were great. I ordered this because I love the size and fit of others I have ordered through this company but this one appears to be a child's size even though it is not listed that way so it doesn't fit. Can't use it ‚òπ
2.0,"Pin is big and bulky and gaudy. I bought two, won't even give it to my friend.  Am going to try to find some more petite and more nicely colored ones."
2.0,The material reminded me of a hospital gound and was not flattering or comfortable at all.
2.0,Some of the images do not display the correct color. I ordered a dress based off the picture. It showed a plum color but it's listed as rust. I was needing a dress for a wedding this weekend. I'd recommend fixing this so there's no confusion to your buyers. I saw the ratings were good which is kind of disappointing. Delivery was quick and packaging was great.
2.0,"This dress if you have a curve body, but way too small. Maybe a size up or two.<br />The dress is not well made. I have a  40 D chest and the bra shows thought. The cut is very low, maybe for someone with a smaller chest? Not sure<br />I really wanted it to work.<br />Also even it was on a sealed bag, it wasn't nicely folded and it was all wrinkled up."
2.0,This is baggy and definitely not the right color as shown in the picture. I do like it but unhappy with the false advertisement if I knew what I was getting I wouldn‚Äôt have spent the money..
2.0,"Purchased this to replace a Casio W-201 whose watch band has failed.<br />An important function is the ability to read the time at night when there is little to no ambient light, so the display light is essential. Unfortunately the light is not bright enough to light up the display. In addition, the button to engage the light is on the upper left instead of the upper right, making it awkward to use. I would return the watch if the packaging had not already been thrown out."
2.0,Low quality frame.
2.0,Runs on the small size. Color was rather washed out. Comfortable enough.
2.0,"I really liked the cut of this swimdress; however, there were too many things to dislike. Color selection was pretty good, print selection not so much. Polka dots are fine, but a few more choices on print would be better. One thing I really disliked was the white underlining. If the skirt comes up, which it will if you actually swim in it, it would be preferable to have the lining match the color of the swimdress or at least be a slimming dark color. The real deal breaker for me was the sewing construction. In the picture it shows two mini tucks right under the bustline and these are what give it the very nice fit that hides all that you want to hide, what the picture doesn't show is that the seam on your right side (when it is on you) hides all that THEY want to hide. All the excess fabric from the lining, rather than putting a seam in it, is tucked into that seam on the right. The result is that when you try it on, it looks cute but something is not quite right, there's a pucker under your right arm and you think maybe the strap isn't adjusted correctly, or maybe I have more underarm fat on that side. And the more you look at it the more of a deal breaker it becomes. The final result for me was a return and a purchase of another brand and style. For what it is worth, I found the best fit and cutest style with a two-piece swimdress style top by Cocoship (Black & White Allover Print Vintage) and a pair of something between a boyshort and bikini bottom with adjustable sides (really, adjustable sides). Too bad Danify couldn't be as creative in sewing construction. Oh, and they will nag, nag, nag for feedback, but so does everyone else. Just sayin"
2.0,"I Thought the band was some sort of metallic metal, not the case it is literally like a cheap plastic material. Does not look like the picture in the description at all."
2.0,"I ordered a larger size upon reading the reviews. I'm a 5'7"" female weighing about 200lbs..... long story short, I probably should've purchased a Lg or Med(I got XL). Plus upon receiving my coveralls & trying them on, it was full of lint. Like really, why? Sent my order back immediately."
2.0,Worn 5-6 times and clasp broke
2.0,The design is cute but the material was cheap. It looked like I could only wear it a few times before it breaks
2.0,Nice in picture but in person looks ver cheaply made and it is not warm at all. Looks only nice in picture
2.0,So...if you have super tiny ears don't waste money on these. They are super cute and seem fairly durable but they were way too big for my ears and didn't fit right.
2.0,"The sizing is completely off; the top is smaller fits like size small, and the bottom is way too big, fits like x large. I don't recommend."
2.0,Product is good but the attention to selecting correct size is not so good.  Ordered large received 3x.  Sent back and received 3x again.
2.0,"So, I think this is a really cute little band. It's comfortable, adjustable in size. But there is one MAJOR flaw. The manufacturer decided not to make it a two-piece band. Instead, the band goes UNDER the watch, so your heart monitor, stress monitor, etc, can't...well monitor. I LOVE the way this looks. BUT I wouldn't recommend buying it if you actually like to use all the features of your Samsung watch."
2.0,"One of the pairs of socks has a hole in the tip, the seam was done wrong and the thread is running as if a finger had come out there, as if it were a used sock."
2.0,The color was great but I was disappointed that this sweater was completely sheer.
2.0,"I didn't like these at all the studs are kind of big for a nose hole and the color is very dull not like pictured, very disappointed  Only 2 stars because of the beautiful packaging."
2.0,I like the warmth I like the comfort I did not like the seams between my fingers unraveling especially around my thumb
2.0,Is not comfy/oversized as it looks in the photos. Sad because i used a giftcard i was saving. Will not be wearing this
2.0,The only thing that was a deal breaker for me was the toe seam- it goes across the edge of the toes as opposed to over the top like normal socks. The seam was a little irritating in shoes
2.0,Same as last review on the foam slide sandals. Way to small and they would not be good for more than 6&#34; of snow because were the buttons are you have no protection from the snow getting in the boot. They were going to charge me more than I paid for the boots to return them so I will see if someone else can use them.
2.0,"The only reason I purchased this hat is because I love large, sagging beanies. I typically wear beanies towards the middle/back of my head, and I like the rest to hand down towards my neck for a more ""relaxed"" look.<br /><br />This beanie I put on the back of my head, and the rest of the beanie pointed out straight back. It was so stiff. I tried pulling it to stretch out the fibers but it didn't do anything. It may sag more with time, but it looks absolutely horrible so I'm not going to take the time to try and break it in. Definitely not what I wanted and no where near as it's pictured."
2.0,"Great quality sweater, however I ordered a women's medium but received a men's medium which is waaaaay too big. Sadly I needed it for tomorrow and will have to return it. Very frustrating."
2.0,Man half the rings broke after 3 days of wearing them you get what you pay for I guess
2.0,It slides off her head...
2.0,This is a beautiful hat but the crown is too shallow to fit snuggly on my head.  And I could not keep the hat on my head when I  tucked my hair into my hat.  Sadly it's being returned.
2.0,It was almost impossible to adjust the sizing. I spent over an hour trying to get this and 2 of the posts wouldn‚Äôt move and I finally gave up.  That is an hour I‚Äôm not getting back. I returned the item.
2.0,"Had to return these, way too long"
2.0,Falls apart in the wash.
2.0,"I read the reviews, and ordered.  It is pretty, and well made. The fabric is nice, but it should not be sold as a blouse.  It is a short dress, and I am just a bit too old for that. The sleeves were nice and full, but much too long.  I'd say intent was good, but design wires got crossed."
2.0,"I shouldn't have expected much, because the cost is very cheap. I just wanted people to be aware that this, the tarnishing does happen. I will stick with 12 K gold, stainless steel or sterling silver."
2.0,Loved idea but it only turns 9n if u hit it or bang into it
2.0,Not durable. Broke after day two
2.0,"Beautiful extremely dainty,too little."
2.0,"I like the idea of this romper dress. A romper with the open skirt in front is a fun and flirty look. However, this piece did not work well for me. For starters, it runs very small. I am a size 6 and generally a medium. I got the large in this and it barely fit. I am 5'7 and it was barely long enough for my torso. The zipper on the inside shorts kept getting stuck and was nearly impossible to zip back up once I unzipped it. It was snagged in the middle and hard to close. Lastly, it is very sheer! She shorts underneath are completely see through and so is the back of the dress. So if you were to wear a bra under this, it is completely see through from the back due to the sheer material."
2.0,"The stitching needs to be adjusted, it seems to be in an uncomfortable location. Will not purchase again."
2.0,Fabric is ok..size is off..length is longer than expected..
2.0,Not too satisfied with this case.  It doesn't clip in well to the holster.  The edge cracked on the first drop. Rubber skin doesn't fit too snug.
2.0,"The scuba fabric feels strange - even though I got a lot of compliments on the dress, I just feel like I would have been much better if it were cotton."
2.0,Would have been great if it hadn't come with huge holes on the sides where the seams weren't completely sewn together.
2.0,I wanted to wear this for family photos. I thought it was cute and comfy. Others thought I looked like I just auditioned for Little House on the Prairie.
2.0,C<br />Super cheap looking
2.0,Not a great bag for packing heavy and tightening straps.<br /><br />Great deal for a cheap hiking bag if you want to pack super light and not really care about having your load tight on your back.<br /><br />I‚Äôve had failures of the strap buckles and the strap attachment points.<br /><br />Also I would not recommend you check this bag on an airplane if you plan on hiking with it at your destination.
2.0,"Charms started falling off the first day and they were made of plastic.  This is probably going to break completely before the week is out.  It's worth maybe $5, not $15."
2.0,"I have other 5.11 Tactical products and love them.  These were poorly constructed, the fingers were sewn crooked."
2.0,Robe was too small for size 7-8. The arms were ridiculously short.
2.0,"At this price point I'm not expecting a Rolex, or a ""rollee"" as my kids call them. However, I wasn't expecting blemishes in the links, and discoloration on the watch ""neck"" right where the links attach. This is a lot of money for me, and I'm disappointed. It was delivered on time is the best thing I can say."
2.0,The pattern is cool but that's about it.  As other reviewers mentioned the edges are unfinished.  It's literally just cut from cloth and stuffed in a plastic bag.  It's also not very stretchy so it is uncomfortable on the nose when it's worn.<br />Just someone else trying to cash-in on the pandemic.
2.0,"Update:<br />I agreed to their terms but told them I was unhappy about it & was going to write a review. They responded in kind & gave me a 50% refund. So I‚Äôm still not happy about the return policy but I must give them kudos for attempting to give better terms to appease me. So I‚Äôm ok with their efforts. Just beware that what you buy may not be returnable‚Ä¶.<br /><br />Ordered this dress. It took a long time to arrive. It‚Äôs was too short & the material was not as expected. It felt poor quality.  I requested to return they replied that will refund 30% & I can keep it. I won‚Äôt wear it, so now I get to have them keep 70% of my money & donate the dress. Just buyer beware!"
2.0,"Great comfort, very light weight, and fits relatively to size. But...<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />The stitch quality is extremely poor. I have three and all three have loose stitches or tears within a week of use. One one of them I've already sewn back multiple areas. I do not recommend. I highly suggest you find something better made."
2.0,"Cheap material, nothing to do with cotton, how dare amazon to offer such terrible item. Don‚Äôt buy it, you will regret."
2.0,I only received one stone.
2.0,"It is a beautiful watch but a little big for my wrist however, I would have loved it if it had not come dead on arrival.  The stem will not push in far enough for the watch to start working.  If I hold the stem in it will work fine until I let go.  I gave it two stars (I was deciding between 1 and 2) because it is such a beautiful watch and I am sure that it can be repaired but I am just really disappointed that is was not working.  I have not contacted anyone about this since it was very inexpensive and I am not really looking for a hassle for the cost."
2.0,They where super cute while they lasted but after about two weeks the post fell off
2.0,Got the pink ones because they looked cute but the side of the lenses facing you is a very dark green :(
2.0,Nicely detailed but too heavy. Gave to a friend
2.0,"They seem like decent quality sneakers for their price. However the description said they had a steel shank. Not true!  They have a very flexible sole. I was trying to get a vet stiff sole shoe and these did not meet that requirement, so I returned them."
2.0,The pattern is cute but the material is so thin you can see right through it and the top is not for busty girls it did not have enough coverage on the sides.
2.0,Light but not solid . Broke in 2 weeks<br />Poor quality
2.0,The style is not like it's pictured.  Tapered legs. Fits like a cat suit but I actually like it.
2.0,Way too small if you're not super skinny order the bigger size even if you usually wear a medium or a large üò§
2.0,"I returned this, I felt it looked better in the pictures than in person."
2.0,One of the  ankle bracelets broke when I put it on.
2.0,"I was hoping for wash and wear; received wash and iron. Shirt arrived as wrinkled as if it had been worn all night by a restless sleeper. I'll wear it, but only if I can find my ironing board."
2.0,"I like this shirt but on the inside of the hood it is white and stands out, I wish the hood would have had a pattern or the bleu to make it lock better."
2.0,Looks cheap.  I donated it to charity.
2.0,"this was SUPER confusing getting this on properly first, then i do a its way too big - returned it. WONDERFUL customer service"
2.0,"They were too lose for me.  I didn‚Äôt like the print, it looked cheap and not very well made. They are good to use as  pjs"
2.0,"In just a couple short months, the life of this jacket is nearing it's tragic end. Seams are opening everywhere. This is perfect for people who only need a solid warm coat for a few days per year."
2.0,"The ring broke on the day it was opened (Christmas day). Otherwise,  the set is really pretty"
2.0,"Hi, I read many of the reviews before buying. I purchased the long sleeve black version. It fits great in the arms and the material is soft and soothing, but unlike most of the reviews that complain that the torso is too short, I find that the torso is WAY too long. I'm 5'5"" and wear size 6 in jeans. The waist band is like a drop-waist flapper type of dress, which is very unflattering on my feminine shape. It rides up a little bit the more I wear it and sits right on your love handles in a bad way. The stride hangs so low in the crotch area that it fits me like ill-fitting harem pants. Returning!"
2.0,I bought this for a costume but it was very cheap- I should have known better though because the price point was cheap! Fine for a kid- but get something nicer if you want to be a swashbuckling pirate.
2.0,"Like the bag - especially the colors. However, the lining is black and it doesnt have a side pleat at the zipper.  oth these factors make it impossible to see what is inside. Poor design for the price. Surprised. Usually like this brand."
2.0,"Shoe okay, but too short in length."
2.0,"I ordered a Small/Medium and they were too big! I'm 105lbs 5'4 but this leggings were baggy on me. Too bad because even though the imitation leather looks kind of cheap, they had a nice kind of trendy feel to them."
2.0,These are cute but it has a large lip and DIGS into your skin. It hurts. I had to take it off after one hour.
2.0,"I have been purchasing the same basic style of Longitude swimsuit in the same size for over ten years.  My body size has not changed.  I was dismayed to discover that my new Longitude suit purchased recently  gapped under the arms and chafed when I swam.  I ordered another of the same suit, thinking that it was an isolated issue, but the gapping was still there in the next one.  Such a disappointment!  I've been a loyal customer for many years.  So sad."
2.0,Was large and shapeless. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and weigh 165 pounds and got a medium. My mom liked it so I gave it to her.
2.0,"Only gave these two stars because although they are nice, they are definitely NOT one size fits all.  I'm tall and slender and these were very tight."
2.0,Like 1 size too small
2.0,"I'm sad these didn't work out. I so love the color and sizes of stones. They were awesome. But, with in a few days of wearing them, I started getting a reaction. I have to have 100% led and nickel free. These say they are, but I had a reaction to them. My lip started to get icky with a stinky colored discharge. My son tried them in his ears, and got the same reaction. If they can make them lead and nickel free, for sure, I would be happy to buy another pair. I loved the sizes and settings."
2.0,The rose gold fades easily into a silver color.
2.0,"Definitely ran more like a juniors XL than an adult XL. I‚Äôm a 38E and I can wear a L or XL at places like Target and Express but this didn‚Äôt zip and even if it had, it would have barely covered my chest. Just keep that in mind for curvy and busty shoppers!"
2.0,difficult to put on. does not stay in place.
2.0,"don't get me wrong, I love the little design on the metal balls...it's just that the spiral piece of these earrings is WAY too big to wear in the tragus!!!  It should not be advertised as a tragus earring, and I never would have bought it if I'd realized just how large it was.  I did, however, take the metal balls off and use them with the small black spiral that I was using but had lost one of the ends on.  Now I love it :)"
2.0,"It looks as pictured. However,  it is very thin nearly see through. Definitely not made for warmth."
2.0,Writing too small.. Yery disappointed that
2.0,The material feels great but I ordered an XL after reading reviews and it fits like a medium.
2.0,I liked the look of the blouse but the material was odd and had no give. Therefore it was too tight across the shoulders
2.0,"Seems to be fairly well made, however, the sizing does not tell you the length. My son is quite tall so it was way to short and he didn't get to wear it for what we purchased it for."
2.0,Thought it would stand on it own but just sits in hour lap so if the child moves it will just fall..
2.0,It came crooked or bent. Other than that it looks pretty good!
2.0,Size is so smaller than what I thought.
2.0,Didn't last long until pieces began to break. Good luck but won't last long
2.0,Sad this is thin and to small
2.0,"I ordered a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and about 125lbs. I took a chance on this dress to wear for a wedding. The slit is much higher than stock image shows and the wrap portion is more central front than to the side. The wrap portion‚Äôs only connection is to the ‚Äúwaist‚Äù (chest/abdomen horizontal seam). Walking around the apartment in front of my boyfriend and he admitted that he could see right inside (leg joint) when I would walk with the wrap opening facing him. The wrap needs to be moved to the side or fastened again further down so it cannot fly open when walking. Having a 31‚Äù inseam could be playing the biggest factor but it‚Äôs a gorgeous and well-made dress, the fabric seems sturdy, isn‚Äôt paper thin or scratchy."
2.0,"Me parecen q est√°n bien de calidad, lo √∫nico malo es q nonme llegaron completas se supone q eran 3 y solo me llego 1 sola correa."
2.0,Sizes run like 2 sizes smaller
2.0,Very cheap. Had a hole in the inseam.
2.0,"Not what was expected, I guess that's why the price was so low. Buyer loses again and seller wins. Name of the game I guess...."
2.0,I bought this on a lightning deal and ended up returning it.  The necklace had a chemical smell and one of the pieces had a hook on the back that made the necklace uncomfortable.
2.0,"Love the color, but when putting them on they are very sheer. Not squat-proof and you can see every line of underwear or bump of cellulite. I ended up returning them which is a shame because I love the green color."
2.0,"Look  great, no durability.  Every pair received broke in the same spot near the nose."
2.0,"Garbage, minimum value for the money."
2.0,"It‚Äôs very obviously not the same as the image, but they tried I guess. The fabrics are completely different, and the belt is‚Ä¶ well, let the pictures speak for themselves.<br /><br />The headpiece is horrific. Truly horrific. The fabric is poorly cut and not at all polished. I‚Äôll have to find another one sold separately that‚Äôs better quality. It‚Äôs not unusual for accessory pieces to be lower quality on mass produced cosplays‚Ä¶. But this one is just a waste of fabric :(<br /><br />The pants are entirely pleather. They‚Äôre comfortable and they fit, but they squeak when you walk and I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre the same material as the image. This is fine, but they definitely fit oddly. There is a little bit of stretch to them which is nice.<br /><br />The top is okay. It fits well, but I was disappointed. The contrast of the material is not the same as the one pictured. It‚Äôs oddly short- if you‚Äôre tall it might not work for you.<br /><br />The gloves are also pretty bad. They‚Äôre hard to get up around my arms and I couldn‚Äôt get them entirely straight. They do stay up though, so a point for that.<br /><br />The cape is decent. I don‚Äôt have too much to say about it.<br /><br />I‚Äôve gotten much better cosplays for the $200 price tag."
2.0,Super stiff and sizes run very small!
2.0,"Had a little bit of trouble with this product. Pretty uncomfortable, and had to continuously readjust while wearing."
2.0,There should be a size option.
2.0,Sizing is very small
2.0,I purchased these for me and a crew member who does salmon spawning ground surveys. In order to see salmon and their redds in the streams you need polarized glasses. I wanted something that was very light or yellow for those rainy/cloudy days when normal sunglasses are too dark. These did not work at all for this purpose. They put a yellow glare on the surface of the water that I couldn't see anything through. They seem like they may be a good night driving glasses but I can't imagine any use for them fishing.
2.0,Got it for my son who is into dinosaurs. Metal is sturdy but eye poped out the first day. I just superglued it back and haven't had a problem since.
2.0,"It's very small, meaning it doesn't really stretch. I bought it for myself and I didn't even try to get it on my head because I knew it was going to be very tight and that would be uncomfortable. I was going to return it but my son tried it on and it fit him fine because he's only 10."
2.0,very short for an extra large.  will prob send it back.
2.0,"The pattern on the fabric is very pretty, but the stitching on the neckline and cuffs is white instead of blue, which makes the dress look cheap (which, let's face it, it is). That's not necessarily a dealbreaker, though. My main issue was that the dress made ME look like a sister wife. It should work on other body types, I think."
2.0,Isn't comfortable.  The rim is so hard it shifts uncomfortably against the collar of my coat
2.0,"Cute but not true to size. If you are a medium get a large, etc. skirt is not as long as what you see in picture."
2.0,Didn't wrap my ear right.  Too heavy.  Loe the little one.
2.0,"Runs at least one size small.  Beware if you are busty and looking to seem slimmer: this cut will maximize every feature you hope to minimize.  I am slim except for my large (natural) bust, and this top makes me look 10 years older and frausy.  Nice fabric, though ‚Äì I think I'll sleep in it."
2.0,I didn't like the way these fit. They are kind of bulky and too long. I've ordered this length before without any issues so I'm not sure why there is a difference. The sizing runs big too.
2.0,It definitely looks  way better on the model on the site than in real life. You don‚Äôt really see the shoulder effect as the photo shows:(
2.0,"At first sight from seeing this online, I had to have it. I have the backpack that goes with it and bought from Disneyland...but once I got it is another story. Although I love the print matching with my backpack, this wallet is a couple shades darker. The front emblem is crooked and the interior label is double printed!! The feel of the faux leather is wrinkled and feels cheap. I feel like I got this from a completely different company! I‚Äôm pretty bummed about it since paying almost $50 for it which the back pack is $56! Overall I‚Äôll try it out and see if it‚Äôs worth keeping. I‚Äôll update when possible."
2.0,Super cute sandals but way too narrow. I had to return.
2.0,I really like the boots but they have defects all over. Very unfortunate.
2.0,"Fits really small. Order up a size. Quality seems good design is cute. The backside is a little too cheecky. Also I paid for 1day shipping on Tuesday and didn't get in time for my trip Friday afternoon‚Äã. Clearly it wouldn't have fit me right anyway but now I have to try getting another and they have not refunded my 1 day shipping charge, just the cost of the suit. Pretty dissapointed. Hopefully this second try will fit better and if not I will not be reordering."
2.0,"Extremely thin, t-shirt material. I wear them under another pair of capris and let the lace on the bottom of these capris show. Almost like a slip."
2.0,Nice but NOT copper
2.0,"Bands are too big, now I am petite but even the last adjustor was still way too loose.  I tried obtaining a refund but it seems I now how to go to a Khols store to drop off the merchandise."
2.0,Went a size up from even the recommended size...still way too small.
2.0,Kept falling off walls.
2.0,Color not represented well in photos.
2.0,This item showed two shirts and I only got one shirt with pictures on both sides.
2.0,"Sleeves are not as pictured, more like ""bell"" shaped at cuff near wrist, sleeve covers cuff and wrist. Also, somewhat thin material or kind of see-through, would need under shirt."
2.0,It doesn't sit flat.
2.0,Is not like in the picture is the regular watch band only different is like a normal wrist watch other than that it serves it purpose.
2.0,"Should have listened to the reviews! I wear a 12 and this garment is very tight, definitely not &#34;flow-y&#34;. ! I'm sure if I sat in it the seams would split. Also, sleeves do not cover the upper arm as pictured. Looks more like a capped sleeve."
2.0,"nothings wrong with them, i just don‚Äôt like the material. they‚Äôre not comfortable and they just look eh."
2.0,"Doesn't look like the photo. Quality seemed fine but meant for very, very short people if it's going to be the length of the picture."
2.0,Runs very small! If your busty this is not for you. I see how it would give tummy control because it is soooo tight. Honestly felt I would have to go 2 sizes up. I am a C cup and normally a Large in Jrs and it just wasn‚Äôt for me. No pictures as to I couldn‚Äôt even get to go up my things. I weight 157 and I am y‚Äôall 5‚Äô7 (hope that that helps)
2.0,"Extremely thin fabric.  Cute style, but the back has no detail and the fabric is so thin it clings and your undergarments show."
2.0,The material very low quality discolored very fast
2.0,Cute but I think a fleece jacket is warmer than this. I returned it.
2.0,"This amounts to wrap around glasses with yellow lenses.  No change in the reflection at night.  Not worth the money I spent.  I didn't give it a one star because I was able to wear them, just not as I had hoped."
2.0,Not at all true to size.  I ordered a large and I think they sent a kids large.  I actually laughed at it. Returned it and did bother to purchase another.
2.0,Expect a product that you would receive off wish.  Not great.  It functions but it's poor quality.  I don't expect it to last long.
2.0,Cute but definetly not what the picture looks like. Its not real african material more like a spandex. I giess you get what u paid for
2.0,I pay for a pulcera and chain but only two bracelets I came.They are nice but not what you buy
2.0,Not true to size at all. Im normally a size 5 so I purchased a Medium thinking it would fit but when i tried on the pants i think even a size small would be to big.
2.0,"This is not quite true to size in certain areas. It looks very pretty and everything but the shoulder and elbow area isn't‚Äã very comfy. The shoulder area feels very awkward. If I move my arms to the front it feels like I'm trying to choke my armpits. Around the elbow area it fits kind of weird too. When Bending the arms, it feels like I'm cutting off the circulation to my forearm. I have very thin arms so it's not that my arms are too big for this piece.<br /><br />I didn't exchange for a bigger size because the tunic already fits very big everywhere else and a larger size would make me look like an empty trash bag.  I really love the style of this, I just don't like the fit."
2.0,They look nice but one earing comes with a with a piece of the tassel chopped. If yours comes fine is a keeper.
2.0,"The color was off, not as dark as the photo so that was disappointing. It does not fit true to size, it was too short, tight, and arms were super short. Packing was unexseptable! Came in all wadded up in the packing like it had been returned and just ship out to the next person with no care!"
2.0,For skinny girls only. Size fools you.
2.0,Color not bright. Disappointed.
2.0,I liked the skirt part of the dress but the top was to big but for the price I‚Äôll keep it and fix the top.
2.0,"The engraving Doesn't Make Sense!  I returned, looked as cheap as it was, ugh"
2.0,"We bought this as a gift for my Dad at work, but though it looks great it only lasted a few days before the retractable part snapped off and we couldn't use it. Cheaply made and not worth purchasing if you are going to actually use it."
2.0,"Beads are very pretty, but our bracelet is missing a bead. Very disappointed since this was for a birthday present :(.  Also, it says adjustable, but the part where you are supposed to tie it - it is already knotted multiple times and glued. So you can't adjust it at all. My 7 year old can barely get it on."
2.0,"Hi there, I actually love this product it fits perfectly, soft and comfy so much so I ordered three more...but...the navy blue nighty showed up stained and faded... so sad.  I hope I can get a replacement soon.<br /><br />soooo sadddd,<br /><br />Deborah"
2.0,I bought two of theses in xl. They both are labeled xl but the gray one is shorter than black. Both are soft fabric but I love the black one wish the gray was long as it show in pictures. I see others had the shortness issue with the gray tank as well.
2.0,"The description says 100% cotton and lace however the material is not cotton it is like some sort of crepe paper material, and it doesn't feel good to the skin I might add.  The lace portion of the dress is beautiful which a shame this would have been a lovely piece"
2.0,"I wear a 2XL in most shirts, I ordered a 3XL and it was tight"
2.0,"The image shown is quite lovely.  While the product seems close to the image - it is actually see thru (all of it) and is too small.  What I REALLY didn't like was the fact that it ships DIRECT FROM CHINA via First Class Mail so I did not enrich any American organizations, accept  maybe Amazon (if that is US).  While I prefer and enjoy to shop online, I don't wish to shop in this manner.  Will not be doing so again.  Will have to find someone to give this item to."
2.0,"Not happy at all, was very small and the color was nothing to write about.<br />I sent it back."
2.0,"I kept this watch because it is so weird, but I almost never wear it  (because it is so weird maybe)."
2.0,This jumpsuit is made of very heavy material (a huge negative to me)... also the material puckered out around the hem line on the back. I tried turning it around and it wasn‚Äôt much different. Also the angle of the straps make them impossible to stay up on my shoulders. Overall I was very unhappy with my jumpsuit.
2.0,Received one shirt . Description says it‚Äôs a 2 pack
2.0,"The shoes are cute bc of the light up feature, but after about a month only one shoe would charge and light up. The material on the insides of the shoe are also ripping. Not the best quality and didn‚Äôt last 2 months."
2.0,I normally wear a small dress.  I am a size 4.  The top part of the dress was too tight.
2.0,Cheap. Holes the first day
2.0,"I‚Äôm giving it two stars because it doesn‚Äôt do what it says it would - built in bra.<br />There are two padded cups inside the nightie, indeed.<br />They are no bra. They wouldn‚Äôt support a feather, let alone breasts.<br />And they are seriously small. If you have cups that small, you don‚Äôt need a nightie with a built in bra. üôÑ"
2.0,"I could barely fit my arms in, I just gave the shirt to my 16 year old who could fit it. She normally wears a small-medium."
2.0,I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs quick returns because these did not appear seamless at all. I returned them right away.
2.0,Too large. My feet slide around and I feel unsteady.
2.0,Don‚Äôt buy these if using for crafts.  The designs on these ate unrecognizable. The deer and gingerbread man are just blobs of brown thread.
2.0,It stretched out first time I wore it. It doesn't stay fit up to face. I tried using it as face cover.  Sadly they dont work for that. Beautiful colors and patterns.  Quick delivery.
2.0,I have this glasses for a month now. One of the rubber sleeve keep falling off frequently when I'm taking glasses off. I took them on and off frequently during bike ride so dropping these sleeve can happen
2.0,If your needs for most things are in the middle range these will probably work better for you than they do for me.
2.0,These do not fit well and are not comfortable at all.
2.0,The picture is very unclear up close.  Material is very thin.  Will work but wouldn't buy again at $25.
2.0,These do not fit in my Modo glasses.  I had to cut into the insert in order for them to fit into the nose piece.  They are thicker than the original ones that my glasses came with.
2.0,"It's pretty but it caused my skin to break out! My stomach started itching the day after putting it on! Then after having it in for almost a week, 5 different small bumps appeared on my stomach causing me to itch! I will keep it but I cannot wear it daily."
2.0,"My son loves the sweatshirt but it is too small. He is a skinny, 13 year old .I ordered a large which is a 12/14. It was way too small. I'm returning it for an xl.. which is an 18, according to the size chart. ???"
2.0,"I've purchased several Romwe clothing items and loved them all, but I was so disappointed in this one! The fabric is a super weird, thick, synthetic. Absolutely nothing like a t-shirt feel and definitely not like what you'd expect from the pictures. It's cute and fits fine but the fabric is so awful It had to go back."
2.0,"These are very nicely made, however they run sooooo small."
2.0,Not worth the money you pay. But then again you get what you pay for.
2.0,"Pros: The grey band looks and feels great.<br /><br />Cons: Even after the clasp is fully secured to the body of the watch it will let go and your watch will hit the deck. In a worse case scenario you wont even feel it come off. You will lose it, and that will be the end of your Gear Fit 2. I lost my watch like 10 times with this band, and for the most part I never even felt it come off. I would just hear it make a noise when it hit the ground."
2.0,This shirt is very see through.  Wasn‚Äôt what I wanted.
2.0,"The fabric used on the inside layer does not allow the user to breathe.  I might as well wear a plastic bag on my head.  The stitching is superb, though."
2.0,"Very loose, doesn't fit well at all."
2.0,"It's pretty, but when I received it - I found that it was also of a plastic substance and I was very disappointed.  I don't know if I will wear it at all."
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:8f92e19344c0143ad5534f5ad74c76d5]] This version is extremely thin and flexible for this kind of case.  You can't ""knock"" on it at all, it is just too soft.  See video.  Protects a ""durable"" pair of sunglasses fine, but it has very low rigidity on its own.  I would not buy this again, I am going to try to find something thicker and more rigid."
2.0,"Its a very cute and is extra loose! At least that is how a large fit me I'm 5&#34; 2 between 120-35 juggling a lot due to health, Im a bit insecure things will be too tight on me, I'm not fat and I'm not thin, I don't have a large bust either but my hips are wide and I didn't want trouble buttoning it up yet I wanted it a size smaller after seeing it. People always make me nervous into buying large online I'm a medium so something that's already baggy might as well try your normal size.<br />Having said that they have my returned jacket, I returned it the next morning and because I was returning two things I put one label on since they all had The same return address. Had a message saying my refund will be ready in 2-3 days and nothing, the skirt I had refunded was refunded the next day! Keep in mind I still put in the barcodes. Its ticking me off because I've heard of people not getting refunds from certain sellers<br />.edit. I don't know if the company of amazon refunded me but I was looking on amazon for the refund<br />So I did ask for the payment to be amazon credit, so every day my balance didn't change..come to find it was returned in my mother's credit card. Sorry it was  confusing and I to go find the email for my mother since she had 47,000. it's a bday gift and I do like.it"
2.0,"Colors are not as bright as in the photos whatsoever.... In real lifr they are darker, not vivid nor colorful.... Fabric is ok though.."
2.0,"Cute. But, fits like an XS. Definitely not one size fits all."
2.0,did not come with charging cable. Lights stopped working on one shoe second day.
2.0,Very uncomfortable and hard soles
2.0,"The arms length is too long, overall the material is good"
2.0,The material is not as thick as I expected. Looks pretty but the material is quite thin.
2.0,It is very small in the chest.the dress is pretty if only it fit correctly
2.0,Order  a 00G the where definitely the size of 0g. &#34;/
2.0,pendant is nice but way to big to wear. very disapointed if it was half the size it is then it would be a nice piece to wear. oh well just hang it on a nail in the house
2.0,"This was a great idea in theory, but after 3 days of continued use the chain that was once gold is a dingy, tarnished, silver metal and completely yuck. I've been using this for my commute on foot to train to work and needed something that looked professional while also allowing me to keep my hands more free. I'll try to find something more long lasting."
2.0,"The boots arrived in a prompt manner, and looked just like the picture, however, they chaffed my husbands legs so badly that he cannot wear them.  When I tried to contact the seller, I was told they did not have an e-mail address available. I called the phone number, but did not get an answer.  They went in the garbage."
2.0,Picture starts to peel off after only a few times wearing it
2.0,"The clasp easily comes loose, which resulted in the watch falling off. I returned it"
2.0,I'm small and I couldn't even get it over my head and arms. It was quite the struggle
2.0,"I have had this band on my watch less than 24 hours and I stopped counting after the 1st 15 compliments. It is very pretty and Sparkly. My fiance told me J-Lo would be proud haha!<br /><br />Update: The band was very pretty, matched my Rose Gold Galaxy Watch perfectly- HOWEVER, it is falling apart. It started with one rhinestone missing, which I could live with. No big Deal. When I put it on yesterday, I noticed an entire strand of rhinestones broke off. So now, I have one side with three strands and one missing rhinestone and the other side is missing an entire band.  Wish it were better quality. It was perfect while it lasted. Probably not worth the $20 considering how it fell apart in a short time.  Bummed out."
2.0,"Material and color not as pictured... I ordered tan with pink top and flowers and material is white not tan...huge difference... material is also a silk/satin material and is VERY unforgiving to anyone who has any type of panty line, spanx line or fat rolls on back.  Will not purchase from this company again."
2.0,One of the glove fingers came unglued.  I had to glue it back.  Flimsy material.  Wouldn't buy again.
2.0,Not made the best for the price.  disappointed. Very flimsy
2.0,Charms fell off
2.0,"These are cute, but a bit &#34;bulby&#34;. It's shaped sort of like a balled up cooked hamburger patty. It even looks funny as it sits on my daughter's head. Because she loves it, she wears it. I just try to not look directly at it or it will drive me crazy because it sits crooked and twisted looking. Also the adjustable head band is not very tight and automatically slips to the loosest setting."
2.0,This fabric is really wrinkly and is a bit thinner than I expected.
2.0,"Much larger than expected,and the frame is a frosted finish rather than shinny."
2.0,"Waffle terry, did not want that. Cat pulls are a LOT more noticeable. NOT for a 5' tall petite, way to large in the body. Will NOT buy a robe from this company again."
2.0,Way too strong. Made me dizzy.
2.0,Not very comfortable and very small fitting and im kinda skinny will continue to seek another case
2.0,"Ordered a Maxi Dress and got a dress that was above the Knee and was off the shoulders with some loose fabric that was ruffled around the bust area, really strange that I didn't get anything close to what I ordered or what was described. I was really excited to get this item and had plans for a special occasion to wear it, ended up having to get something else. Returned this item as I was sent the incorrect item."
2.0,Does not fit well. Bottom a lot smaller than described.
2.0,"This shirt is awkward. The neck is somewhat tight and then the shirt is almost sheer and not fitted from there, until the bottom where it tapers back in. It fits like the oppsite of how it looks in the picture. Like I said, it's an awkward fit, and I don't like it."
2.0,"The goggles fit pretty good, and mostly no water gets in, but they get foggy the whole time, like after I tunk them under water literally 2 seconds later they are foggy again."
2.0,"These socks are just ok! Not very thick at all, there basically as thin as dress socks.<br /><br />The colors are true to the description, I just wish they were thicker."
2.0,"Mine came with a lil chip on it. I was going to return, but gave it to someone. Very hot to wear for a long period of time."
2.0,.It's not like the picture
2.0,"They don't stay in place properly, but fit great and are comfortable. It works only if used under tight biking shorts so they don't ride down."
2.0,It was cut too small so I gave it to my daughter.  Cool cut jacket though.
2.0,"Just recieved the new gear. I may have to return due to sizing. I measured my subs wrists prior to orderinmg.<br />She has a 7' circumference wrist. Very concened the wrist restraints will be to small.<br />There is absolutly No-Way this would fit a 10"" wrist as advertised<br />gonna be dicey for a 7"" wrist<br /><br />BTW -- looks to be a quality restraint"
2.0,I really wanted to like this top but the stripes are so mismatched! It makes the top look extremely cheap. It didn‚Äôt fit that well either. I wear a medium or large depending on how narrow it runs. I bought this is a large and the fit was very tight except in the shoulders where it looked ok.
2.0,"Did not receive exactly what is shown in the preview when I ordered. I received 2 different styles of bracelets. Because of this, It will make it difficult to distribute the items as I intended. I do not have time to reorder."
2.0,I ordered an XS and this thing looks like it's for someone who's at least 6 feet tall. Returning.
2.0,They feel cheap and they were way too long for my 5' tall body.
2.0,Small knotted portion doesn‚Äôt fit onto the earring.
2.0,The shirt itself is fine. The lettering on the shirt itself is rather flimsy and I have a feeling that it will not last long on the t-shirt. Bought it for my daughter and she seems happy enough with it for now.
2.0,"Maybe this hat should be more appropriately be called the ‚ÄúPolyurethane L Hat‚Äù, because it is not leather."
2.0,"Material way to thin,  Turtleneck didn‚Äôt fit right, Miss shaped"
2.0,Things slip out too easily
2.0,"These are so cute but they are huge. They slip outside of your ears, wont stay on your head when put up, and slide off your face."
2.0,"I loved the design, but when they arrived, they were smaller than stated. While the jewels/rhinestones were pretty and looked of decent quality, the metal felt flimsy and one jewel was already loose. I returned them."
2.0,It doesn't fit my wrist correctly.....the face of the watch is too large.
2.0,"This just didn‚Äôt work for me at all. The fabric doesn‚Äôt have any stretch to it. I couldn‚Äôt even get it over my head. I think if the sleeves weren‚Äôt part of the dress, it may have worked. I ordered an XXL. Will be returning."
2.0,This runs quite large.
2.0,So cute! But broke when I was trying to put it on.
2.0,"My brallete was not constructed properly, there was a hole right in the middle. I had to fix it myself since I needed it for tonight."
2.0,I bought it two size up n it still to small. This dress run extremely small
2.0,"The curve of the lens distorts the view.  This gave me a headache,"
2.0,Mostly didn‚Äôt like material .. poor quality!
2.0,"Buyers beware. This NATO strap is not stitched, it's glued on."
2.0,"Just received mine today, and I'm pleased.  I got the ones I ordered, and received them in nice small gift bags with different necklace chains.  Thank you!  UPDATE: was held in by very cheap glue, which didn't hold... I don't wear them for fear of losing them."
2.0,This fit me more like a shirt than a dress. Im 5'8 and average build and the dress barely covered my butt. Not worth it if you are on the taller side. Better for a really petite person. And the material was just ok.
2.0,A bit too short.  Not knocked out by the dress.  It will sit in my closet for awhile.
2.0,Once the balls screw off it breaks and can't screw back on very disappointing
2.0,"Wouldn't recommend, although cute, shirt is VERY SMALL! I ordered a call and it fits my daughter who wears a medium. Also cheaply made! Not worth the money."
2.0,Cheap feeling costume like material. Also way to big. Return was simple.
2.0,Straps broke on 2 of them before I even washed them
2.0,Very cute look just like picture but one broke after the first time of wearing it
2.0,I ordered an XL and this would fit a small Junior female. Do not believe the sizing of this product!
2.0,"Cons: If you have a normal American body, I hope you like your waistline directly across your boobs.<br />  This puppy changes from fitted top to flowing skirt with a sharp tight seam-line  3  inches higher than  any empire waisted dress I've ever<br />  seen.  Obviously made for Asian women, so bigger size I guess just means fatter, not taller.  I'm 5'10&#34; but still, crazy high waistline.<br />  I wanted to keep it because it's so darn pretty, but would have to get my breasts removed to wear it.<br />  The photo makes it look like a regular waist line, right? but don't be deceived.  Tall women should not even waste their time trying this on.<br />  However, If you have tiny breasts or You are under 5 ft 4 inches tall, this is probably a really great dress for you.  Quite a high Empire waist.<br />Pros:  The dress material is awesome,  made well, even has a zipper.  A steal at this price.  Knee length so it has an elegance & nicely flowing skirt."
2.0,Could put the holes closer to the end of the belt
2.0,back looks cheap
2.0,I returned the 1st one I ordered because it was too small.  Then I received the wrong swimsuit when I reordered.
2.0,"Ordered this watch for my husband. He loved it, and it looks really nice, but after two weeks it has stopped keeping time and is always 5-10 minutes behind, regardless if he remembers to wind it or not."
2.0,Very thin and not nearly as bright and vibrant as in the pictures. The olive green is very drab and the red is not bright at all. Very much more subdued than I had expected. Still soft though.
2.0,Not a winning product. This product should say for people who don't care how their watch band looks or feels. Let me put it this way this is not a man product - maybe for a boy or girl.
2.0,They're maternity pants i think?
2.0,"Very cheap material being used to make these. Think old fruit-of-the-loom t-shirt material that has been washed a million times, and then you'll be close. Shoddy workmanship on assembling all the pieces together. I wouldn't count on the images shown here as authentic. What I received was very low quality."
2.0,I have only owned this for 2 months and it is already faded and brittle feeling.  Wanted to love it but can't recommend.
2.0,I had bought a set of these in October and just bought 2 more sets because I loved them so much.<br />Both sets of black had holes in them right out of the package.<br />1 pair of the pink also had holes in the side.<br />I was highly disappointed in them this time around.
2.0,very disappointed that one came untied the first day I wore it.<br /><br />very nice looking though
2.0,My daughter had to wear her costume to several Halloween events. It started to come apart after the first use and i had to sew it back together.<br />When washed the pink color ran so it got all over the white. But it did comes with all pieces as described just not the best quality
2.0,I quite liked this ring once it arrived. I bought it to wear while pregnant and my wedding band wouldn't fit. After only wearing for a week or so the gold plating has rubbed off so the ring is now looking silver.
2.0,the  sleeves were short and not true to it size I ordered a large
2.0,Missing gold paint in a lot of stop...Have to touch up and buy gold paint to fix issue....Would return but the Super Bowl is this weekend...Will not re-buy.
2.0,Beautiful and shipped on time. Unfortunately self winding mechanism came apart after worn only 3 or 4 times. Apparently got a bad one.
2.0,These earrings were beautiful. But the weight of them hurt my ears.
2.0,Was expecting something much larger. This is not brooch size.
2.0,I still haven't given this watch as a gift because I am ashamed to give it to someone. There are threads hanging off the sides. The metal is noticeably cheap. This has sat in its packaging because there's no way I can gift this to someone.
2.0,"Wasn‚Äôt the right size üôÑ I ordered a medium and it was really tight . The shirt is cute though , just order a bigger size then what you normally wear"
2.0,Seam is on front and slants diagonally. Fits somewhat large.
2.0,"the fringe is too ong and tangles, had to cut mine way short"
2.0,"I REFUSE TO PAY FOR OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES.<br />I ordered a 10 and got what appears to be a siize 8.<br />I attempted to send boots back due to they WILL NOT fit My feet.  This seller has set it up to where I have to pay $5.13 to return, nowhere in description indicates having to pay for returns & will be deducted from boot's price.  It's STEALING from ME.  There's a number on the bottom of boots #260 that's NOT a size number.  I don't know what ""260"" means.  For all I think it could be is a style number or color number.<br />When I purchase footwear anywhere in the USA it says ""10"" or ""10-1/2"" on bottom or inside of footwear."
2.0,She pretended to love it altho it was much too big for her ankle....I suppose this would've been almost big enough to wear around her neck so keep that in mind if ordering.
2.0,Fits true to size . Very disappointing that it was dirty (inside the package ) . Good quality but a white Leo should be white fresh out of the package.
2.0,it looks nice but the measurements didn't match up. was way to tight in my belly/crotch area. never got to wear it.
2.0,"Printed design is slanted, and slightly off center. Its too bad because I like the quality of the shirt and the print. Would like to keep it, but it looks sloppy when on."
2.0,"This product runs a size smaller and was a cheap material.  When I opened the packaging, it smells like vinegar.  Returning the product for refund instead of an exchange."
2.0,To snug on my Fred Flintstone legs and feets.
2.0,Not what I was expecting. the case is to hard to get on the phone. How do I return it
2.0,"crap material and too big, waste of money"
2.0,Wasn't really impressed not as pretty as the picture necklace runs really small
2.0,"The swim shorts arrived on time, quality is wonderful; however, there was a glitch with the sewing. The middle was attached to the seam... ughh... I had to carefully cut it to separate the seam... thus cutting a small hole in it."
2.0,"These are cute, yes, but the antler placement makes it look like it‚Äôs coming straight out of your nose."
2.0,Extremely cheap quality. Wouldn't even buy for half the amount I paid.
2.0,I really like the design but piece of junk stopped working after 3 days and fell apart when I tried to change the battery ....is in the trash now
2.0,"The pattern was really pretty and the shirt fit great. But after two washes, I noticed several holes worn in front, almost like friction did it. Had to throw out. Not durable material at all."
2.0,"You have two choices, a singular heart light up necklace or ""both,"" which shows seemingly that PLUS a multiple heart necklace. This is not the case. You get the multi heart, and a kids bracelet with the singular heart. Very misleading, and too late for me to do anything about it now."
2.0,Pretty but runs larger than normal
2.0,"The metal clasp was not strong enough to hold my keys and ID. So, I knotted it and then clasped it. Last week it snagged a hole in my sweater and broke."
2.0,"Item not quite as described.<br /><br />2-pack contains 2 different colors.  I selected white, got 1 white, 1 gray.<br />Not a problem, but not what I wanted."
2.0,"This watch was soooo big!!! It was even too big for his Dad. I found this under kids watches, looked good. Never said it was not for children. Had to send this back and hope we get the packaging info soon. It was a gift and it messed everything up. Not happy at all. We did order another watch, totally different from Amazon. That came on time. Happy now!"
2.0,When I pull it up over my nose it feels too tight like it‚Äôs smushing my nose a bit. Also when I talk with it on it either bunches up in my mount or slowly goes down my face
2.0,"Glasses were cute, but came used and scratched up.  Someone had previously worn them, they had makeup on the bridge of the nose area of the glasses.  were also visibly scratched up."
2.0,The front is really nice but the butt looks very odd & flat! If yo are flat in the back it should look ok but not if you are normal. Tried it in a small & large size and still the same look...Very odd fitting. Didn‚Äôt keep it
2.0,"I liked it when it's new, but after wearing for a while the gold tone starts wearing off. It becomes dull."
2.0,Cheap fabric. Doesn't cover the breast area. Can't have bra under. Lenght perfect. Looks great.
2.0,It is just ok.
2.0,This hat has a very thin lining and not very warm.  Though it covers my ears it is not adequte to keep my head warm below 45 degrees.
2.0,After about a week of use the band started to smell pretty bad. The band is real stiff and takes AWHILE to break in.
2.0,"If this bra/camisole had not had so much padding and if it didn't have lace over the cups, it would have been great. The texture of the lace with darts over the cups made it very visible under my rayon or cotton knit tops. If you need the padding, which would create a more voluminous bust if you're smaller, and don't mind seeing the texture of everything under your tops, then it's a really good bra/camisole. Just didn't work for me. I like the smooth look."
2.0,I went a size up because I like things loose but be aware these are RAYON & spandex. No cotton in the fabric
2.0,Very see through. Cheap material. (Thin)
2.0,"I already threw this away,  3 washings and the fabric turned sticky and weird.  like the spandex was disintegrating  waste of money"
2.0,"I read the other reviews prior to purchasing and saw the charms could fall off easy.  I was prepared to secure them before giving as a gift to my daughter for 8th grade graduation.<br /><br />I still had high expectations for this bangle because we both love this quite and thought it was fitting for beginning her high school journey.<br /><br />However, you can not read the quote without glasses and even then it is small.<br /><br />Also, the company logo is the most legitable thing on the bangle and they put it on 3 of the charms which to going overboard and takes away from the beauty of the bangle.<br /><br />I am not sure I will give this to my daughter or not.  I may keep for myself since my initials are MC and that is what is most identifiable on the charms.  Please look at my photo.<br /><br />Overall, I am disappointed and would not recommend this as a gift"
2.0,got rapidly damaged.
2.0,I really wanted to like this top but it was so small and short. Also very see through. I returned it.
2.0,The fabric was great and it was sewn well. But it ran extremely small. I gave it to my much tinier co-worker. I bought the XL and she is a size 8.
2.0,"While these leggings are super cute, I was devestated to see they are see thru. I don't care to flash my entire are at the gym. If the material was thicker... only if.."
2.0,Wore out within two weeks.
2.0,Ordered up 1 size due to reviews.  These are much smaller than my older cotton briefs which are actually 2 sizes smaller.  I ordered up to avoid being too tight in waist or legs for sleeping.  Did draw up a bit when washed/dried.  Decent fabric...just too uncomfortable for my needs.
2.0,Super cute but stitching is coming apart after first use. Haven't even washed it yet
2.0,Looks like a cute sweater but definitely did not receive a women‚Äôs XL.  It appears to be girls sizing.
2.0,"These shades are gorgeous! Exactly how I thought they would be. The only problem is they are too loose. If I tilt my head down, they fall off. I've tried to tighten them up but that was no help. Very disappointed I can't wear them this weekend like I had planned."
2.0,I read the reviews before I purchased these boxers. It seems like about everyone that purchased said that they ran real small. I normally would wear a medium size. But I am using them for sleeping so I would usually purchase a large. In this case I bought XL and it is still too small. I do not recommend these boxers.
2.0,"When I first put these on, they were itching and coarse inside. I washed the pants to see if that would soften them up, but that was not the case. The inside material is still rough and uncomfortable. The only reason why I bought them was that these specific sweat pants were on sale for cyber Monday. I am only keeping them because I don't have another pair of sweat pants. Soon as I get another pair, I will be tossing these away."
2.0,It‚Äôs not durable enough for toddlers use.
2.0,Looks good but chafes at ankle
2.0,"Despite being adjustable,this ring was way too big. The design is lovely, but I cant wear it. Usually a ring size 5-7, unless you have bigger fingers, dont waste the money."
2.0,The stem came out of one after wearing 4-5 times.
2.0,"The ring is fine enough-- fits, doesn't cause allergies, etc., but it is noticeably cheap-- the jewel was poorly cute even as a glass gem, and the filigree design is obviously painted on. This is not one of my go-tos."
2.0,I didn't like how the material smelled and how uncomfortably rough and thick it was. It was unbearable to try and put on my face so I returned it right away. Good design as for realism but not comfortable to wear.
2.0,"Sweatshirt is nice and fits great. However, mine was delivered with a security tag attached. I contacted Amazon to see the appropriate process to have this removed and was told to buy a strong magnet.<br />Better quality checks are needed before shipping items out."
2.0,"The title is misleading this watch strap is for a regular wrist watch NOT an iwatch. It does not come with any of the attachment parts, which were an additional $9. I would have purchased another watch band if I knew this band does not fit the iwatch.<br />E"
2.0,"I‚Äôve purchased several of these where you get a few bracelets, you don‚Äôt get to choose colors, and have always been happy- this time I was happy with the colors- but this last purchase from this seller was not as durable as others."
2.0,"This coat was too large when I received it, and the style and material was not quite what I expected. I returned the coat."
2.0,this comes not put together which im sad about cause its hard for me to put it together
2.0,"I could tell they would be hot.  But, I took a chance just to try."
2.0,The dress was sized strangely.  Especially the arm holes.  Way too tight.  I had not purchased this brand before although I have half a dozen of this style of dress from Amazon.  Obviously I find them comfortable or I wouldn‚Äôt have half a dozen.  The price point of this manufacturer was very low and the old adage you get what you pay for is true.  I sent it back.
2.0,Cheaply made. It broke as my daughter was putting it on
2.0,very cheaply made.
2.0,I could not read the names easily.
2.0,These are very wide and large for size.
2.0,"The material is nice & soft, but quality control is lacking. On the brown pair, one sock was literally 2 inches shorter than the other. I'm not wearing socks that aren't even, it would drive me nuts!!<br />The other pairs, while relatively even, were at least 2 inches short of my knees.<br />I'm only 5'5"" but I do have long legs for my height, so I was hoping these would work.<br />If they made these a couple inches longer & had better quality control, I would buy several pairs but that's not happening."
2.0,I got the brown one. it's not as pictured
2.0,"This raincoat has the most wrinkled appearance of any packable garment I have ever seen. It remains the same after being hung in the closet for a month. It might be waterproof (I have not been able to test it under any significant rain), but it is not pleasant to look at. I am afraid my wife will not allow me to unpack it any time in the future to test its functionality under the rain. This color is striking and you will be noticed as you ride your bike."
2.0,Was hoping for a more traditional cats eye shape than these frames were. Sent them back as I felt they weren't flattering.
2.0,"This dress smelled terrible right out of the bag. The ""lace"" work is interesting, but ultimately looks cheap. The rest of the dress is the generic stretchy material that is way too see through."
2.0,"Really cute hat with a slouchy look, but itched my forehead terribly. I‚Äôm going to try washing it an additional time to see if that helps with the itchiness"
2.0,"I bought this in black in XL, I am 45, 5‚Äô8, & about 180lbs. First, right from the start it snagged on the plastic zipper as I took it out of the bag and if I wasn‚Äôt more careful it would have been gnarly. That‚Äôs concerning, I am clumsy, I need something a bit more durable. The knit material isn‚Äôt silky soft, it is more a cotton knit, and not quite solid black, in the pictures you can see it almost is a black heather with lighter thread throughout, which I kinda like.  I probably have more texture issues then others but pre wash I don‚Äôt care for it, maybe it will be softer after a wash but I won‚Äôt be finding out. The neck just doesn‚Äôt look or feel natural as off the shoulder or as a wide boat neck. It isn‚Äôt a wide long shape it is more rounded and much too small for me. I took a picture of it on and next to a smaller more sophisticated model for more perspective. She is a size negative 00. She also was worried about snagging, she likes to keep her nails long and sharp tipped. Not a keeper. Going back to üá®üá≥"
2.0,Fits well everywhere other than length. The shirt comes down to about my belly button.... I'm not that tall. The picture definitely made it look like a normal length shirt.
2.0,Returned as it was completely sheer in the back. Fit tighter than expected. Wear a large in everything and the large in this fit more like a medium.
2.0,Two of the pockets have torn out already and zipper gets stuck...a LOT!
2.0,"I really wanted to like this.  It is very cute.  The fabric is nice.  The dress is a bit short.  But overall, it just fit me like a sack.  I was a bit disappointed."
2.0,Had to give this to my friend who wears a 00 and I ordered a L
2.0,"Very poor quality! The canvas had an odd chemical smell. I washed the darn thing and most of the smell is gone. But the apron is too small, the ties too short and it's very wrinkled. I don't like it and don't recommend it. It's cheap and not worth the hassle of returning it to Amazon."
2.0,I ordered this shirt for Christmas and when it came in the mail... it had iron prints on it. Looked like it had been under heat too long...The shirt now has a weird line above the words CREED and it's very noticeable.
2.0,The slit was waaaay too high for me. Went up my butt. I am a curvy girl though.. this dress might have been okay if I had sized up again. Got a L
2.0,A little distorted.
2.0,The shirt was really cute but that pants were cheap fabric and something I could done myself with a pair of Walmart pants.
2.0,I didn't expect it to be sooooo big.. I won't wear this ANYWHERE!
2.0,This runs extremely small and it took over a month to be delivered.
2.0,They are way to hot for summer and a little to long also
2.0,Nice fit but they are all getting holes in them after six months so buy something else.
2.0,"Strange fabric.  More than pilling, it seems to be shedding or bunching.  Worn a few times and already looking ragged.  Probably won‚Äôt last the winter"
2.0,"The style is really cute. Fits true to size and has a nice nipped waist. That said, this jacket doesn‚Äôt keep my daughter warm in anything below 50 degrees. The padding is super thin and definitely isn‚Äôt meant to insulate."
2.0,"Runs way to small and very poor fit. Pretty, but not a good material or fit."
2.0,The dress runs small because it‚Äôll shrink after one wash. The material is so thin it‚Äôs see through. It also wrinkles easily so it needs to be ironed out. The colors are nice though and it did not fade after the first wash.
2.0,Nice looking key chain except for the leather between the ring n clip it‚Äôs tearing after a week
2.0,"I purchased several (5) tops from this brand at one time, and all but one is a total waste of. Pulled them out of their packages and immediately washed according to instructions... cold on delicate cycle and hung to dry... the worst shrinkage I have ever seen!!! Not the fixable kind, either. The fabric was NOT preshrunk before cutting and stitching the pattern together, that‚Äôs for sure. TotL waste of money and very disappointing, since they looked cute out of the package. This one in particular shrunk up from being large on my xl body to crop top length with arms the size of empty paper towel rolls. üò°"
2.0,Fast shipping and good quality but color is not as pictured. I ordered the blouse in mustard and it is yellow!! So disappointed!!
2.0,Using their chart still end up with a very small shirt
2.0,"I don't even know what to say about this... the material is uncomfortable; no stretch at all, hot. The top is too big, the skirt is just weird and uncomfortable."
2.0,"The pair I got arent rose colored at all, they're nice as is but not even close to the color they show which is a disappointment. They have even less color in person."
2.0,More quality materials could of been used to maintain durability. I guess to get for what‚Äôs worth
2.0,"I was surprised by how cheap the fabric and design look in person, but I love how the dress flares at the bottom and it is very comfortable, even with a petty coat."
2.0,The material is of poor quality
2.0,Much smaller than anticipated.
2.0,"The print was not centered on the shirt. The screens needed cleaning before the shirt was printed. There were lines in the print from where the screens weren't cleaned properly. The shirt did arrive on time. So it wasn't all bad. The sticker was awesome, but the shirt should have been put into a second's pile."
2.0,"Style is not at all what is pictured. It was more like a flare dress shape rather than a slim fit as pictured.  Color was NOT anywhere close to &#34;grey&#34;...it was light navy blue.  I'm really surprised at the good reveiws that this got.  Returning the product on my own dime, not happy."
2.0,There had to be a defect in the foot portion of the boot. I ordered size 8 and 9 and both I couldn‚Äôt get zipper past my ankle. Too bad because it‚Äôs a nice fitting boot from the top knee area
2.0,Fit a bit to tight too cutting off circulation.
2.0,"I love these and I loved the look of them, but after the third time wearing them I already at a hole in the crotch area!!  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving them a 2."
2.0,I ordered a 2X and the shirt I received may not even be a large.  I gave it two stars because it looks like it may be a good shirt.  I'll never know...I couldn't get it over my shoulders.  Many of the comments indicated this shirt fit just right.  I don't know if they are mislabeling some of these at the factory or what may be going on here.
2.0,Not so great quality
2.0,Is better  spent  more money  for a good watch
2.0,Do not like the way the belt splits at the buckle..wish it was one solid piece of leather.
2.0,"The coat is addorable but centimeters are apparently smaller in whatever country it is made in than they are in the U.S. The measurements were off by about 8 cm, which made the medium the same measurements as they had for the extra small. When I asked to exchange it they said I could keep it and buy a new one for a $5 discount. When I checked their site again the xl which by those measurements would be the medium was $10 less than the medium. Quality of the material and stitching was great but it is not as described at all. Not happy at all."
2.0,Somewhat large...
2.0,"Even though I have tried to be understanding since communicating with this seller, I simply cannot see that it takes as much as a full month to receive the item. I don't care WHERE in the world it is made....The info they gave me in the beginning was that the product was shipped on the same day the order was placed. How is that possible? I am very disappointed with the whole process. Buyers should be aware of all the issues and I am certain Amazon will NOT post this review. Having been an Amazon customer for several years, only once before have I been disappointed with any of my purchases, for any reason."
2.0,"the shirt was really terrible, it didn't close well at the top, and I knew it ran sml, so I ordered the 3 x, and I wear a 16/18 not true to size AT ALL. I didn't like the closure at all it looks decent in the photo, but in fact the top button wont close because of rushing, you have to keep buttoning, and lets not even talk about the wrinkles"
2.0,Runs super big I would size down next time sleeves are also cut a bit on the large side
2.0,"I've been using this hat all summer when mowing the lawn and it's more lightweight and breathable that the cloth baseball caps I used to wear.  My big complaint is the buckle on the adjustment strap.  The buckle doesn't ""hold"" the strap in position; the strap just slips through the buckle without any friction to hold it in place.  I would not purchase again."
2.0,"The hoodie I received had dropped seams on the sleeves that were awkwardly gathered, or runched, between the shoulder and elbow, giving the lower section of sleeve a tight fit. Really strangely made. I returned it."
2.0,"It's beautiful that's why it gets 2 stars for 1 the fit was not correct although it did come with an extender. Which if it was the correct fit i wouldn't need. 2 the cup size was definitely off. My breasts looked like two nuclear missiles waiting to be activated and sent off, no cleavage what so evef there was a canyon in between them.. I'm definitely not satisfied with this product whatsoever."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:e817860c9303e512f19e41d3f120c8ed]] I‚Äôll give it a 2out of 4 but be aware!! They Made it seem like it‚Äôs an original Disney collection pin So if you are a pin trader in Disney be aware!! It‚Äôs definitely cute so I would purchase again how I lost it but definitely I do not like how they try to trade market out a Disney original. Be aware
2.0,It said small but was more like a big meduim
2.0,"it‚Äôs okay quality , they run pretty small . ordered a medium and fit like a small so i‚Äôd say size up . plus it didn‚Äôt come with the earring either."
2.0,"I purchased this shoe for my mother. It seems like a nice shoe. It fits her (ignore all my comments above about fit, because I know nothing about toe box, width, arch support, or fit, other than the ability to slide the shoe over a high arch). The shoes have no sign of wear. There are two negatives. (1) The shoes seem to be second hand or fakes. There were no manufacturer's tags on the shoes. There were two clear-plastic shoe bags in the box but the shoes were not in the bags. I dislike paying new prices for used or fake items. (2) Dear mom has the highest arches in the world. Often I buy her shoes with zippers on the arches to help her get in the shoes. These shoes are somewhat difficult to get over a high arch. If you have normal feet, you will like these shoes. If you have an extraordinary arch, you may have slight difficulty getting your arch into the shoes. Mom seems as happy with the shoes as any demented 98yo woman could be."
2.0,cheap quality/thin material. About 2 days of wear and they already tore at the toes and by 4 days her toe was sticking out.
2.0,"This sweater dress looks NOTHING like picture. I am 5' 6&#34; weigh 132.  I ordered an x lg because I wanted on oversize sweater. It is loose on me only with the zippers open. In the picture the sleeves look gathered, but not on the sweater I received.  Total disappointment.  So done at amazon should be looking at what they are selling to be sure it matches the picture used to sell it."
2.0,Needed it in white and it was extremely see through. You pretty much would either need to have it lined by a seamstress or as I did try with nude underwear but even that showed through! In any other color I think it would be great. A little long on my 5'7 frame even in heels so it's being returned
2.0,Very cheaply made.  A button even fell off after wearing them only 2x.
2.0,"This is a good set for the inexpensive price but my ears weren‚Äôt having it. They became dry and crusted from the orings and one of the plugs I used got a crack in it which is not very sanitary. I had to return them and buy better quality plugs, after that my ears healed right up."
2.0,"Quality not what I thought it was, gave to me 7 year old niece , she used it and strap broke."
2.0,Material is ver scratchy and doesn't cling well.
2.0,Awful smell even after washed for 3 time
2.0,"The colors are lovely but the top part of the dress is of such thin fabric that within an hour of wear, the dress is all out of shape."
2.0,The pads that go on back of heel are sticky on both sides and didn't stay on shoe.  The shoe liners aren't that comfortable.  They have a high side arch and the little bumps that are supposed to &#34;massage&#34; your feet are not that great.  I'd look elsewhere and buy separately the items you really want/need.
2.0,"The Terra Fi 3 Firetread Coffee was my fourth pair of Teva sandals. The previous 3 pairs were the Terra Fi 2's. Which were great right out of the box, up to this present moment. They just feel great and I still wear them all as part of a weekly rotation!<br /><br />That same praise was not the case with the Terra Fi 3's. Save for the design on the straps and some minor cosmetic changes they look just like the TF 2's. That's where the similarities end and the discomfort begins!<br /><br />I kept thinking that maybe it was just me. Or perhaps, unlike the previous models, they just needed to be broken in? I mean, when I put the TF 2's on and walked in them, there was a bounce in my step. The heel on these was hard and unyielding. I mean, as in, NO BOUNCE in my step! Just really hard!<br /><br />Well, it has been well over a year since I first strapped on my Terra Fi 3's and there has been no breaking in to be had. If anything the heel is worse than ever, since the area around the Shock Pad is now considerably lower than the unyielding ""improvement."" If you hear what I'm saying, it's like this little mountain sitting there in the place where there should be a comfortable heel cup.<br /><br />The discomfort in the heel area is so pronounced it's almost like the guy who came up with this supposed improvement said, ""Oh, snap! Lets put a rock in the heel and call it a Shock Pad!"" There is also less padding on the primary strap that goes across the top of your foot, adding additional insult to injury!<br /><br />D'oh! Bad move! Dude (whoever you are), you ruined a great sandal!<br /><br />I wanted a new pair for the summer and was fortunate to find a pair of Terra Fi 2's in my size (12) on Ebay. I snapped 'em up in a heartbeat! Got 'em last week -- Hallelujah! My feet are happy again and so am I.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love Teva sandals. So much so that, in addition to the TF 2's I got last week, yesterday I ordered a new pair of Teva Toachi 2's that should be heading my way later next week. The reviews on those sounded so overwhelmingly good that I just had to see if they lived up to the hype and experience the joy for myself.<br /><br />Hopefully my review and impression of the Teva Terra Fi 3 will help someone avoid the discomfort that I, and apparently others, have experienced with this newer and definitely NOT improved Teva sandal? I would not recommend these to anyone. The Terra Fi 2's are a definite winner and hopefully by this time next week I will be saying the same about the Toachi 2's?"
2.0,Who‚Äôs idea was it to make the stitching black on seamless leggings..?
2.0,Not a fan of this dress. Poor quality. The stitching is completely off centered. The picture is not what u are getting. I would pay extra for 1 more tulle and a couple inches ugh
2.0,"for the price, its a good buy. the fabric is thin and not much elasticity to it"
2.0,The Velcro on this pulls away from the material so it is not made well at all. I had to cut mine because it was pinching my skin<br />Poorly made item
2.0,not flattering at all
2.0,The arms don't for with the rest of the short. I sent this back and got a refund
2.0,Size was good but the post was large and makes it difficult to get them in resulting in sore ears.
2.0,"The gloves were too big for my 3 year old.  On the plus side, he'll grow into them and it's not wasted money."
2.0,The top of the jumper is super cute but the bottoms are baggy and pretty much dont match the top.  Im going to try to get the bottoms altered because I really wanted something fun & flirty for my upcoming birthday but to know I have to pay additional for it to look right pisses me off.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GETTING THIS!
2.0,"These fit close to the face and give off some weird color shading. They are OK, but I have had better."
2.0,"The change in fabric occurs right over the nipple, which looks weird. The sweater also ran very small. In general. The tailor of the top was just awkward."
2.0,"My perfect slipper's bottom fell out on the first wash, so disappointed.<br />It says stitched but not to the sole and so little glue on this one."
2.0,"Super cute pj‚Äôs. A little tight around the upper arms, but soft and cozy."
2.0,These are not like the factory lenses. Everything is green when looking through them.
2.0,"Order the 40 pack last year 2018, did not receive A SINGLE duplicate shoe keychain. Reordered again this year and received two separate 20 packs. Between the two packs, there were 6 different types of shoes, but in multiple colors. Some were even duplicates of duplicates. There were QTY 8 AJ 13 , QTY 8 AJ 5, and so on. The most I received of one pair were QTY 12 AJ 6. Not sure what happened, but it sure was a surprise to see so many duplicates. Quality of the product is still good though."
2.0,Very small and the fabric is transparent
2.0,Cheaply made and hiked at the back.
2.0,"Love the print but will have to spend time altering. It is enormous is size and touches the floor, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù."
2.0,I love starry night and Nightmare before christmas so i fellin love with these masks. However I cannot breathe in them. The fabric they are made from is like putting a plastic bag on your face. I am so disappointed because I really love them but even after short periods of time I feel out of breath and if i am trying to talk forget it.
2.0,"I have a rather short torso and this swimsuit was not long enough for me which created a weird tightness in the wrong areas. It was also too wide at the waste which created some bulging. I am 5&#34;7 and 138 pounds, 34DD cup. Needless to say the top part did not fit at all. It is a cute swimsuit and really wish it had fit. Maybe for some other body types this would look great but it's a gamble you are just going to have to take."
2.0,not proportional
2.0,BEWARE don't wear this for too long because it will leave black circles or marks on your skin
2.0,"I was expecting a more defined flower shape, like what is pictured! I was clearly sold on a digital concept and not the actual product. The lotus shape is not clearly defined--the curves and esges all meld together as if shaping into an amorphous blob. The sparkle is more like a glimmer at best. This is not very good quality at all."
2.0,Zipper broke after one use. It runs small. Changing a diaper is a pain. One wash and the material went bust. Giving it two stars because is soft.
2.0,"Although the legs fit well, the top portion fit like granny underwear or maternity? If your planning on wearing them with longer shirts, you can hide it. BUT if you don‚Äôt, the top portion is very unappealing to the eye. The legs go with a modern cut with neat design. The top half is stuck between ‚ÄúHey I might be pregnant and have room for my tummy to grow OR  if I sneeze, I‚Äôm so old I‚Äôll piss myself but look at me... I‚Äôm so hip.‚Äù  In the picture a very slim woman is wearing them and it seems to look good. I‚Äôm about 120lbs soak and wet, so you would think I‚Äôd look great in these pants. The cut on top is baggy, like they are expecting a person with a baby pouch or gut to buy a size small. Go figure, picture is alittle deceiving."
2.0,"When it arrived, it was a beautiful rose gold. Unfortunately, the rose gold color rubbed off within two days of wearing it. Now, it‚Äôs just a light gold color. Not the color I wanted at all. Very unhappy with my purchase."
2.0,"These are very very comfortable. However, they are cut too small in the butt and they rip if I move too quickly. I ordered a size larger than I usually wear because of what some other reviews said. Unfortunately that was not enough."
2.0,"They need something across the heel, to hold them on.<br />They fall off, when I'm walking.<br /><br />Otherwise,  they are very comfortable."
2.0,I got a headache as soon as I put these own. The plastic lenses are just not smooth or clear enough. Also the product smelled strongly of chemicals.
2.0,Ordered a plus-size and it was so small my granddaughter couldn‚Äôt wear it. Granted it comes from China so beware about sizing as it is not USA sizes!
2.0,"It was very comfortable, even more than my Fox padded liner.<br />First time it was worn, and it saved my hip from a crash. The lining tore at the hip padding area, but thing was the little pads started to fall out of that tear.  That was not cool. Had to return the product, because I‚Äôm not going to spend $80 for something that will be good for only one crash."
2.0,Chain has knots in it. The charm is beautiful.
2.0,Quality is quite poor....I found loose threads and the front slip wasn't straight...
2.0,"The material is like thick nylon. If you have a bigger boos, won't be look so great. I don't hate the look but it makes it look like maternity cloth."
2.0,They're okay. You definitely get what you pay for.
2.0,I‚Äôm sorry but I didn‚Äôt like the socks- the elastic was too tight and it got uncomfortable after an hour and I had to take them off!!
2.0,After I wrote my review one of the turquoise balls broke in half. It had a brown line down it as if it had been glued and it just fell apart.  I forgot about this when I wrote my review. Will not buy from this manufacturer again
2.0,The outer edges don't stick and pop out. No good.
2.0,This bracelet is kid sized.<br /><br />I have a small wrist but this was uncomfortable for me to try to wear..I'm returning it
2.0,"The blazer got returned because it was too large, odd fabric, itchy, and super see through. I wouldn't waste your time- find a different blazer. I got a large with a 36DD (41"" bust), 5'3"", and 160 lbs and it looked like a 1X on me."
2.0,Missing one of the long charms and one of the necklaces isn‚Äôt attached to the others. Will probably try to fix myself and find a charm for it. Hopefully it‚Äôll still turn out pretty.
2.0,"I bought this watch excited about the fact that it is digital and analogue, and quickly found out that the two are out of sync. Also the date will unexpectedly stop at any random day and the digital time gets ahead quite quickly."
2.0,"Several issues to address with this item.first off the size it is simply too slim even for some one like me who is fit and athletic. second of all the seller lies in the description as these pair of pants are not cotton. The third item is the authenticity of the product, these pants seems to be authentic LB. As to the customer service I emailed the seller about several issues I had with the a return and the worn out aspect of some of the items that I had ordered and it resulted and nothing being done. So be aware."
2.0,"It's cute... but day 2 it started having problems retracting. The cord would get stuck and I'd have to pull it out and kind of have to baby it along to get it back in. They way the clip is positioned you cannot unclip it one handed. It's way too close to the edge and it's a strong clip. Should have been centered to allow for leverage. Tempted to return it, but I have used it so I'll just keep it for a back up and get a different one."
2.0,The real jumpsuit doesn't look like the photos at all. The photos show a nice texture and drape to the fabric. The real thing has NO VISIBLE TEXTURE AND NO DRAPE. The fabric is quite smooth polyester. You have to iron it to get the folds out. I ordered the large size even though the size chart said I should order size small. The large size is only a little bit too big for me; I think medium would have been too small. I will give this jumpsuit to charity.
2.0,The chain is thicker than i expected:(
2.0,Not cotton. Definitely poly blend. Very cool and a bit sheer if you get the white color. Pattern is pixelated and a bit cheesy looking. Not what I‚Äôd hoped for.
2.0,"looks cheap, color lighter than ordered"
2.0,"Zipper works in both directions,,,,,,,,,strap poor quality even though inexpensive"
2.0,This shirt was such a disappointment. It is cheap looking and is a magnet for lint .
2.0,It is super cute but it broke after wearing it a few times. I didn't even wear it that long. I'm very disappointed. I love the design but don't want to reorder it since it broke so soon.
2.0,Looks nothing like the picture. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does seem to be sewed together well.
2.0,"So I wanted to get my wife a set of silicone wedding rings to wear for work. I bought these since she wanted some glittery ones, camo & solid shiny colors. As you will see in my pics the color is barely visible. Not what was pictured in the ad. So buyer beware. Going to try to return them. No clue about reliability."
2.0,"I wanted these to work since the fleece on the inside was so soft and nice but it didn't go over my booty. I do have an ample bottom so I do have this problem, but I'm usually able to wear a size Large for leggings. Not meant for curvy girls."
2.0,This dress was way too long and too low cut. The fabric is very clingy so it highlights all my &#34;imperfections&#34;.
2.0,You only get one.  It showed two and  i didnt read the description to fully clarify.  Now thankfully for the rest of you i see they've changed the description to price per one.  Im guessing several complained.  I needed a pair.  So ill be returning mine.  Because i dont want to spend $30 for a pair. (Including shipping)
2.0,Not very comfy. Slid down
2.0,I used their measuring chart and it didn‚Äôt fit well at all. Order the next size larger to be safe. Also the buttons were large and silver didn‚Äôt like the fit or the look.
2.0,"Scrap material for costumes, day one. At these prices, it is a gamble and this was a loss as an outfit. Hopefully I find use for the entrails resulting from attempting to wear it."
2.0,"These arrived quickly and looked nice but when my small faced 7 year old tried them on, they did not fit and were way too tight.  I normally have to order very small masks for him because his face is small but these were way too small.  They would never fit my older son who is 10."
2.0,"Giving it two stars because I like the model and the compartment but the quality of the purse isn't great. The middle compartment that is attached with the gold-color metal fell after like one week, so everything on the middle compartment could fall and/or be seen, I had to glue it back on (temporary fix) but of course after two weeks it broke again. The part where you close it also fell and I had to glue it back on. The side compartments are great."
2.0,"I don't quite hate it, but regret buying it.  Too late to return, so I'll probably donate or something."
2.0,head bad is kinda thin. and not too absorbent. Used once  and put the rest in the drawer. to save for a rainy day! possible can use all five on one head and then you 'll have a heavy duty headband. i did buy this for a child as a first time user of a headband. i tried one on and they it was tight.
2.0,"Most of the strands need a lot more beads, I considered returning it, but it may work with a turtleneck. I will not purchase from this company again."
2.0,"I ordered mint and it came in white. I like the dress, just wish it was the colors I ordered."
2.0,The dress looks much better on the model than in person.  It runs large and long.  The material is thin.  It will be returned.
2.0,"[[ASIN:B01I91OPM0 Men's Leather Belt Sliding Buckle Belt Reversible Black & Brown (39-40)]]  I am surprised that when I took it out of the box it fell apart in my hand before I could have my husband try it on.  I tried to put it back together and it was more trouble than it was worth.  There are no instructions on how to fix the belt and be ready to use some elbow grease.  It  is not a easy fix.  The belt is thick and it is hard to get the pin and screw to fit together.  I will be contacting the company to see if they can help trouble shoot me through getting this to stay fastened together.  I Liked how heavily made it was,  how the leather was thick and well made.  After working on the buckle for an hour, it fits well.  If it had stayed together I would have given this belt a full 5 stars.  It's just hard to get past having to fix a product you just bought and haven't been able to even use it a full day with it staying together."
2.0,Loved the bracelet but it has lost its color. The finish is tarnished and the Luke writing is no longer burgundy
2.0,They aren't that adjustable or have much give. One broke by me just trying to put it on myself. They all came in one back individually wrapped. I wish they were a little more stretchy. I broke my favorite one.
2.0,Received very late. Item was okay.
2.0,"Cute undies, but too small. These are in Asian sizes. Order 2 sizes bigger. Despite the size, they are well made and not thin."
2.0,All the pieces came apart.
2.0,"Cheap material, cheaply made, and so so small."
2.0,On the pictures both set of earrings are gold I received one gold and the pearl earrings in silver. üòû
2.0,really makes your wrist sweat horrible
2.0,Poorly made. There were several strings to cut. The tie is in an odd position and not attached.
2.0,"Not a good product. Washed it once and now the waistband is messed up. Also, the material is thick and isn‚Äôt great for running or working out."
2.0,Earrings do not stay in position. they come off my ear lob and hang down like a &#34;normal&#34; earring.
2.0,"These shorts have an elastic band inside the top waist band that is smaller than the waist band itself. This creates a point that cinches in so that the shorts aren't smooth around your waist. The elastic band also isn't tacked down, so it rolls and twists freely inside the waist band.<br /><br />If these didn't have the elastic band in them, they would be very comfortable. The elastic band makes me want to set them on fire, perhaps while wearing them."
2.0,Liked the material but the polka dots in the front didn't match up at all so made it look cheap. I'm petite and it was just too baggy. Returned.
2.0,I will play with this some more to see if I can make it work and fit better.
2.0,Another thing to repairü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2.0,They are too close together and small. Great if you don't have a fat head I guess. Gave them away.
2.0,"I returned mine because it had no stability, not even a hard bottom. I was worried that my things could easily fall out in the car or whenever it was not in my possession to hold it upright. I got the light blue. The color was nice. The material felt very soft."
2.0,The Brown Band broke on the first day.
2.0,"Design is good, poor material though"
2.0,These were not true to size and were at least 1 - 1.5 sizes too small. Very uncomfortable. Found another brand that I liked considerably better.
2.0,Not what expected! Dissatisfied with the product! Color doesn't even match with the picture üòíüò£
2.0,"Arrived on time however it fit everywhere else except the chest. The sizing chart is deceiving. I would‚Äôve had it altered and worn it but there were two large stains of what appeared to be melted plastic on the front which I couldn‚Äôt do anything about. The quality of the fabric was nice, somewhat heavier then I was expecting and the design was nice. I was issued a full refund but I wished I had gotten to wear the dress instead."
2.0,Super cute put caused me major ankle problems because of the lack of support.
2.0,"These glasses feel cheap. One arm already fell off, the screw is just gone. Nothing is broke, the screw just fell out. They are super cute though."
2.0,"Not too bad for a bedroom slipper I just wish it had more padding in the sole of the shoe. It feels like I'm walking on the floor, no soft foam padding to walk on, feels like I'm walking on a piece of cardboard. Not for walking around in around the house or standing a long time in them because your feet will start to hurt. But they are pretty and fluffy on the top so this slipper gets style points but no points for comfort."
2.0,The coat does not book at all like the picture.
2.0,You get what you pay for.  The top straps aren't sewn evenly.  It's fine for sleeping in or as a layering piece but looks to cheap to wear on its own.
2.0,Arm space had weird flap of material.  Dress is very drapey.
2.0,"The photos of the skirt really don't capture the spirit of these stiff shiny micro-pleats. Dozens and dozens of these skinny polyester pleats are starched stiff enough to hold up the skirt on its own. And the shine is blinding. Weirdest part is the matte black elastic band at the waist. It's a plain elastic band, no matching fabric, no fabric of any sort, just an elastic band.<br /><br />And when I sit down while wearing it? It puffs up at the lap like I sat on an air vent. It's really a goofy skirt that I cannot see myself wearing on purpose.<br /><br />However, Halloween is coming up and I can always use it for a witch costume."
2.0,[[VIDEOID:6afa68cd9d8c1223c1ce3056dc11ebaf]] These are not 4mm earrings ... more like 2mm!
2.0,Its a good idea but my hairties never stay on the bracelet. they always slide off
2.0,It is too big can I exchange this for a small?
2.0,"Looked better in picture than when I opened parcel. Will keep it, but will probably donate it to charity."
2.0,"This shirt is HUGE, and really awkward.It seems like a large piece of fabric that is used to make bathing suits that just has 3 holes cut into it. I did buy this to go with my &#34;lazy&#34; halloween costume (I was a witch and wanted a flowy black shirt). It served it's purpose, but outside of that I do not think I will ever wear this outside of the house again."
2.0,"Though it appears to have an A-line form, the dress was very unflattering to the figure and very loose."
2.0,They do not shine like the picture shows.  They look like a cheap store pair of earrings.  I will not wear them much.
2.0,The grommets are too poorly attached to the belt and they pull out.  Not good.
2.0,Material de mala calidad
2.0,I am not sure about this bra. It‚Äôs great when I first put it on but rides up under my band line and cuts in. Too big? Too small? Feels like an undewire
2.0,Fabric fades fast
2.0,"These were cheaper-looking than I anticipated.  They were a gift for my stepdaughter, and she and I were both surprised that the only thing in the pack resembling an earring back was a tiny piece of clear plastic.  My advice is, don't buy these."
2.0,"seller shipped just fine. I found these to be too long. they were uncomfortable and stabbed me. I am a large person 5',8&#34; and still didn't see how these could fit a normal sized private area."
2.0,Smaller than toddler size - they are more an infant size mitten
2.0,"Really love this strap. Been wearing it for about 2 1/2 weeks, and as you can see it started peeling today. Really disappointing, as I‚Äôve never had this happen on a ‚Äúleather‚Äù strap, even from Amazon."
2.0,"I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 125 pounds, small frame.<br />This top fits large!!"
2.0,"The multi colored skull scrub/working cap is humongous.  The material is soft, silky and a tad too shiny for my liking.  The buttons are placed too far back to utilize for wearing a mask.  Unfortunately, unhappy with my purchase."
2.0,There isn't a lot of room for your butt.
2.0,"The band is so cute! But it is too small for my wrist. Maybe I should have paid closer attention to size? But I‚Äôve bought Halloween, Christmas, and winter themed bands, from different sellers, and they all fit."
2.0,One of the zippers broke after 3 days of use.  Cute bag if the zipper was of good quality.
2.0,This is cute but wore it once and a jewel popped out .
2.0,If your are tall do not buy! I'm 5'9 and had to return for a refund. It was ill fitting and was riding up in the front. Not cute! Had to return for a refund. And the material is very stretchy.
2.0,These are pretty but very lightweight to the point of feeling cheap. I have trouble keeping them in my ears because they slip out.
2.0,way to long. will have to have tailored
2.0,Cheap material actually came with wholes around edges
2.0,[[VIDEOID:1efedcd72b5667eba708775341dd42bc]] ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2.0,They tarnished from every day wear. Never put them in water and tarnished about a month of wear
2.0,"Unless you have very, very slender feet, that strap isn't going over the top of your foot ... furthermore, (and perhaps it's just me) I couldn't for the life of me figure out how the strap locks ... seemed like a part could have been missing ... shoes looked so comfortable, quality, and light but not cheap light if that makes sense ... wish they would have worked out.  Sooooooo bummed!"
2.0,Way too long. I'm 5'5&#34; and with four inch heels they would work. Stretchy material cheep looking. Love the color
2.0,"Beware the pseud-camel toe! I really wanted to love these. They were cute, soft, and comfortable. Not compression pants, pretty thin material, but felt nice. Biggest turn-off was there was a little extra material in the crotch area, so if you stood with your legs together like a human being does, it gathered in a very unfortunate giant camel toe looking way üò≥.  Needless to say, that was a deal breaker for me. Returning."
2.0,"(I'm 5'9&#34;, 145 lbs) Just an awkward hoodie.  Sleeves are really short (they ended about an inch and a half up my  forearm) and the band around the waist looks odd.  The fabric feels slippery and looks shiny, kinda like a sports jersey.  I'm bummed, it looked so cute in the pic.  Maybe I'm the akward one."
2.0,"Original, muy bonita pero una oreja estaba caida, ordene el reemplazo y nunca lleg√≥"
2.0,I ordered a 1 3/8 barbell and got a 1 1/2. Good quality though.
2.0,Had to return them.  I wear a 38 for all my pants and shorts.  These had a 38 label but were like a 35 or 36.  Way too small throughout.
2.0,Very thin and see through material
2.0,"Not well made. I have only worn it occasionally and now the frame won't hold the Fitbit Blaze pebble. I wanted a &#34;sporty&#34; band and the low price was attractive, but you get what you pay for."
2.0,Great idea but they don't stay in very well.
2.0,This hurt my ear. Couldn't sleep in it
2.0,Case is small!
2.0,"this little wallet is great for inside a purse, but as for a wristlet I wouldn't trust the attachable little loop to hold anything. I was looking for something I could use to carry my GS6 (in the case) and a tiny coin purse which holds three cards, plus keys. This item cannot do that. The color was just like the picture, and the hardware attractive."
2.0,Sorted by plus size but it was still too small.
2.0,Smelled terrible even after a few washes. I emailed the seller and they gave a partial refund. Overall a cute hat but I couldn't get past the stench.
2.0,The dress was a nice style but when I tried it on the neck/collar was way too high and the arms were snug. Love the ethic print and look but wasn't what I expected so i returned it
2.0,Didn‚Äôt see much difference when shark tooth hunting. Not worth the money.
2.0,"Kind of strange the way this fits.  In addition, the buttonholes weren‚Äôt cut?"
2.0,Disappointed. Cute outfit but it was too small. I sized up and that didn‚Äôt help.
2.0,Cute dress but do not get it in white! It is see through!!! The material is stretchy and form fitting. I think I would like it more if it wasn‚Äôt translucent. I‚Äôm about 125lbs and ordered a small‚Ä¶ which I think is about right.
2.0,Order two sizes up form usa sizes. They do will not give a full refund. The zipper still badly.
2.0,Hard to position and never stayed. Constantly adjusting. But maybe it's for a kid. I'm 6 ft 190 lbs. looks really cool though
2.0,It‚Äôs nice. Was a bit to short it didn‚Äôt cover my neck
2.0,Lost color fast and bends out of shape easily
2.0,"The colors of the shirt‚Äôs artwork are not even close to the brightness and quality shown in the product image. The artwork looks washed and faded, like the shirt printer was running out of ink. I expected better."
2.0,"cute belt, color is more red not brown also impossible to keep tight because of the material the wrap around part is made of. for me it doesn't look right because it won't stay tied. Disappointed"
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but it feels cheaply made. For the price it‚Äôs not too bad."
2.0,I order it for my bunny costume but nobody will even notice it. Maybe it will look nice on a toddler
2.0,Broke in less then a week
2.0,I just received this and am pretty disappointed.  It does not look like the picture.  It is a clear piece of glass covering some shiny gold with green and black blobs added to it.  It does photograph very well though.  I was going to add a picture but it looks prettier in the picture that it is.  It also took 3-4 days for the company to ship this out.  I won't be ordering from them again.
2.0,Disliked cor
2.0,"This is very small, might fit a child.  It also is sheer, so not really great as a face covering."
2.0,"Just a bummer,  went to wear it and the zipper broke as it‚Äôs missing a tooth.  Went to return and I‚Äôm outside the return window as I didn‚Äôt wear it immediately after purchase."
2.0,Unfortunately the sizing is small and I can not tell you how well it supports or if it is comfortable.
2.0,"Order Up a size, if considering this item"
2.0,Small is too small unlike the original ones!!
2.0,If your vehicle has a headrest this cap is going to be a disappointment. The metal clip on the back (Used to adjust the size) is quite bulky and will become the main point of contact between your head and the headrest which is very uncomfortable.
2.0,Though it‚Äôs pretty cute it‚Äôs really big and VERY cheaply made
2.0,Beautiful skirt but it is definitely one size fits extra small.
2.0,I'm 5'10 and I thought from reading the review that it would fit my legs or st least hit my ankles. Well it didn't. I got a small in black I measured the inseam which barley hit 27 inches. Too short. The over all length is 37.
2.0,I just received this 2 days ago and I noticed today that the coloring is already starting to wear off.  See the photos I attached.  I would not recommend this item.
2.0,"Without being able to select a size, this mask is to small and I have a beard too so that makes it difficult also. So if you have a small/skinny face and no beard this is probably for you."
2.0,Bought the t-Rex mask for my child. Way too big. Even too big for me.
2.0,This is listed as a compression tank it is not a compression tank it does fit ok.  it‚Äôs loose I bought these to sleep in for extra support I have other tanks that fit tighter ok quality just not compression
2.0,"A nice cap for cool weather, definitely not a winter cap. Get the Cannondale version and have no regrets. This cap is paper thin and the visor has no substance. It's a boy sent to do a man's job."
2.0,Super tacky looking
2.0,"Beautiful blanket, color true to photos online and fit horse as measured.  However, it is already torn.  A part holding<br />one of the belly straps has ripped off.  I do not even own a sewing machine, let alone a heavy duty one.  Got about<br />a months use out of it.  My other horses blankets bought elsewhere/different brands are fine.  There are only 3<br />elderly horses in this pasture and it is not exactly a wildwest show, so I am disappointed."
2.0,too big and too complicated
2.0,I just tied the back instead of clapsed it. I'm a 34a and I got a small and it didn't really fit
2.0,"You get what you pay for, they are so not sturdy and very loose fitting behind my ears. The color was what I was looking for but the frames are a miss..could‚Äôve lived without them."
2.0,"To long, but looks ok overall"
2.0,"Not sized well for Samsung smartwatch - too wide.  HAD to use a tool and took a long time to force because it's too wide. Broke fingernails before I switched to the tool. It was an effort. The band is for a large wrist and the loops are fixed in place.  Using the next to smallest hole for sizing, almost 2"" of the excess band hangs. I will have to get double sided tape to stick it down.  Looks good though and seems decently made although not sure how the pin slots will hold up with all the forcing."
2.0,"The fabric of the lanyard is good and doesn‚Äôt irate the skin. The problem is the plastic hooks that attach to the face mask. They break off at the metal part fairly easily. In addition, they come off of the metal eye easily."
2.0,Was expecting a more cotton texture  not happy with it
2.0,It was tight on my boyfriends head.  The dragon looks like alf. I thought it was sewn funny too.
2.0,It bends too easily and I keep losing the nose guards. The case is too heavy to carry around.
2.0,static cling
2.0,"One of the lever backs didn't work at all and the other one barely did.  I was able to bend them enough to wear them for one party, but that will be it.  However, they looked good and the little jingle sound attracted several compliments.  I may put the charms on a better quality hoop.  I was surprised that they didn't make my ears itch."
2.0,weak post.
2.0,The clasp is not secure and constantly comes undone. I would not purchase this again.
2.0,"Fingers a bit long and fits tight around back of hand and is hard to put on if hands are sweaty. Dexterity is not very good. Gloves are fine for yard work but not good for manipulating parts and screws like in woodworking or car mechanical work. You get what you pay for, basically a cheap pair of gloves."
2.0,This shirt literally makes noise because of the image.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll withstand being washed so will be returning.  The image itself is nice though.
2.0,Runs very small order 1 or sizes bigger.
2.0,Way too small. Looks like a child‚Äôs size.
2.0,Got this for my granddaughter.  Didn‚Äôt fit right.  Tried to send it back but had to take it 45 minutes away.  Couldn‚Äôt print out and send back like I have always done. I didn‚Äôt drive all that distance to return.  Too late now.  I‚Äôm disappointed in Amazon for the crazy way to have to drive 45 min to return.  I got her a different one that fit great.  Still have the one that didn‚Äôt fit.  Maybe I can take to consignment!
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5 feet tall, 116 pounds, 34B. I find these to be way too tight and way too small. If you are in need of a camisole, the Vanity Fair, small camisole #17166 fits perfect."
2.0,It didn't fit like a large. A large is like a medium
2.0,"It is a very comfortable, relaxed bra. The only problem is with the cup size. It does not matter how big you get  it the cup size does not increase causing the bulging of the breast from the sides which looks very ugly. The mold that defines the cup size is one piece attached in the middle. It would be great if that mold would get bigger in bigger sized bra. It has a nice shape."
2.0,"This was bought for my girlfriends, mothers grandmother (whew!).  She loves everything about the moon and she thought it would be perfect, however when she opened it, she was surprised to see how small the charm was.  About the size of a dime I would say.  We returned the item."
2.0,"Described as one size fits all, which works if you are not bigger than a size 10."
2.0,"We ordered this mask for Halloween for my son,  it broke  as we unpacked it. It was nice quality just very disappointed it was so brittle."
2.0,These were not as shown. The logo was missing from the cuff. Makes me think they were knock-offs or seconds. Shipped in a bag direct from China. Middle finger was not touch sensitive.
2.0,This item returned with stones mising. MUCH prettier in the picture too. You can buy this at Gordmans for $6.00
2.0,"It WILL hold three bags of groceries as claimed, but as carry bags go, this was overpriced."
2.0,"I‚Äôd like to preface by saying I love the look of the glasses. I got the purple pair. They weren‚Äôt oversized, which was kind of a bummer, but not a deal breaker. The deal breaker for me were the lenses. When I wear these glasses, it‚Äôs almost as if I‚Äôm looking through 3D glasses at non-3D objects. There‚Äôs a weird rainbow or red/blue effect on anything lit up or digital screens. Looking at your phone, there will be a rainbow effect on the screen. The worst is when driving. When the sun flashes out from behind trees when you‚Äôre moving along, it‚Äôs literally blinding and the sunglasses do not help, but make it worse. I have no idea why this happens, I have never experienced this with any other sunglasses. I think I‚Äôll wear these while sitting outside or on the beach, but never to drive. Please be advised."
2.0,Was super excited to get this dress I‚Äôd had it in my cart for awhile. It‚Äôs not the true cotton spandex material like most maxi dresses. It‚Äôs see through at the top with the light gray I have to wear a cami underneath which defeated the purpose of a nice cool dress for summer heat and to top it all off it turns out it‚Äôs hand wash only! Not a simple throw on dress.
2.0,"I was really excited to get this, as the blue color looked so pretty online. I don‚Äôt have a lot of sweatshirts either. When it came I was pleased with the color, however the texture of the fabric felt very different than any other sweatshirt I‚Äôve ever had and when I put it on, it felt tight, but yet fit loosely. It is unflattering and I will probably use it for a pj top. I‚Äôm disappointing as I was looking forward to a new sweatshirt."
2.0,"Okay fabric, would have sized up if I had known runs slightly cop topy small and length of sleeves. I would pay $10 for material measuring up to comfort and expectation. Don't buy unless you size up and layer."
2.0,"I bought this tank top to wear as a cute sleep top and boy am I glad I did! This tank is so cheap and flimsy I would have been mortified if I had actually planned on wearing this out of the house with jeans or shorts. I would also suggest sizing down as this seems to run large.<br />This actually does work as a sleep tank, but I seriously would recommend looking elsewhere if you're looking for a cute top to head out in. The material is just so cheap and tacky looking."
2.0,Great shoe for school uniform but the toe is already showing wear and tear. These won't last the year probably.<br /><br />UPDATE: These shoes show signs of wear and tear very easily. DO NOT waste your money.
2.0,These are soooo short.  Must be made for someone 4 ft tall!
2.0,Thin fabric. Looks cheap.
2.0,It‚Äôs way to big for a child and even an adult
2.0,Suuuuper Soft and comfy.
2.0,Cute bracelets but after wearing them over night both started to fall apart.  The colored twine on the adult bracelet unwound while sleeping. The child‚Äôs slip knot came undone and had to retie it with a different knot.
2.0,"I was so excited for this dress. I got it for my engagement photos in the white and had looked at the reviews and saw everyone raving about it‚Ä¶I‚Äôm heartbroken. The bottom is beautiful, but the top‚Ä¶the cups are extremely visible and it looks really bad üò≠. I‚Äôm hoping there is a way I can fix it because I paid so much‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm out of time."
2.0,"The dress fit everywhere except my boobs.<br />The dress itself is beautiful, but not made for women with very large breasts."
2.0,This little lanyard chain was thin but cute.<br />However it broke the first time I wore it.  Better to spend a little more and get something sturdier with a stronger chain.
2.0,"It's a pretty accessory, but it's sewn as a rectangle (as opposed to a rounded shape). It looks really odd when worn. You could tuck in or sew the corners so that it's a more flattering shape, but I decided it wasn't worth the effort."
2.0,"While these look super cute, they curve in really weirdly at the top center of the breasts.  I look okay in the mirror, but when I look down it appears that my boobs are somewhat square-ish? & disformed from the way the top is moulded.  Dam shame too, because they give good support & would be great in the gym & in many aspects look great.  But as they are shaped, I am too self-conscious in them to wear them out of the house.  They do seem to be well made as far as craftsmanship.  But the funky shape makes me only give it 2 stars."
2.0,"I loved color and nice material, fits to tight"
2.0,"I am in between sizes. I'm a medium or small on top and a large or extra large on bottom. So when I saw this has a cinch element in the back I was excited. Well the material is straight rough canvas and if you cinch the back it looks terrible. It arrived balled up, not even folded, so I'm guessing mine was returned and sent out as is or something. From the front it's very cute, but the back and material ruined it for me."
2.0,Go up a size! The skirt couldn‚Äôt even zip. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 and 170 lbs and it was both too small and too short.
2.0,"Jeans are cute and long I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and they cover my ankles, just a little snug on my thighs the color started to fade after 3 washes in cold water."
2.0,"I'm giving this 2 stars because it arrived on time and in nice packaging.  However, it broke the first day I wore it, I did manage to fix it, but now it's tarnished.  So I basically wasted my money! If you need something quick to pull of a look it may work!"
2.0,"This dress is cute in theory, but the dazzle elements look really inexpensive. They appear bronze in the photo, but are actually clear crystals, which I found unappealing."
2.0,weird fit specially the shoulder area.
2.0,"Cute suit, but not true to size. Very tight. Bottom aren't adjustable as it appears in the pic."
2.0,After wearing it for a while it is still stiff and uncomfortable.<br />I am a 39/40 waist and ordered a size 42.  It's about 2 or 3 inches too long..<br />I threw it away.
2.0,It broke after 3 months when I dropped it
2.0,Way to tight suffocates you
2.0,"This dress is made out of a very soft material and the print is beautiful in person! the colors are very vivid and bright. However this dress did not fit me very well, I am self conscious of my waist/hip area and this dress accentuated those parts of my body. The way the bodice and skirt are sewed together leaves a line running across the middle of the stomach area and it bunched up weird and didn't fit very well if you carry extra weight in that area. Ordering a larger size if you have a thicker midsection like I do would possibly take care of that issue, but I just returned it for a different dress. I was not thrilled with how the seam in the middle of the dress broke up the print and it was very obvious the top and skirt of the dress were sewed together from two different pieces as the pattern didn't match up."
2.0,Strange sizing...runs large and ruching is waist level rather than at breat bone as shown in product photos.
2.0,I bought this for my shiro wig and to be fair I'm not impressed. The quality of the wig overall needs improvement. Shiro's white part is dead center while the wig is extremely to the side and overall off kilter. Will be returning because i need a better wig to hide all my hair underneath and the wefts are too spaced out and too short to properly do so.
2.0,"Most of the pieces in this mix that were 18, the double hoop was even smaller, maybe a 22 gage. The onlyones that are 16g are the ones with a stright clicker bar, but they are too small to fit a septum unless it's pierced low. I was pretty dissapointed in this product for it's sizing, but the jewelry was nice at least."
2.0,"This shirt wasn't like the photos,  as most clothes I've ordered on amazon have been crap. The shirt fit but the back was a hot mess. Undone, and falling apart. The front was just a cheap tank top like the white wife beater tanks. I still wore the shirt for the summer but could have looked so much better. Had to lace mine as tight as they would go and tuck the super long string inside my shirt. Could have been a lovely shirt..."
2.0,fit is real weird. not like the picture. the top half fits but the bottom is real wide.
2.0,"They are actually the same size as other small frames, I would even say smaller. DO NOT buy if you want oversized readers.  They are good quality though."
2.0,"Jewelry is mis-sized. I've ordered both 5/16&#34; and 3/8&#34; and the delivered pieces were identical. The beads are 2mm, not 3mm.<br />This makes me wonder what else is not accurate about these. Are they truly 316L? Who knows. If they can't get sizing right, they can't be trusted for anything else."
2.0,The upper part of the sandals came off before I even put it on a keychain.
2.0,You can definitely tell the material of this hoodie is very very cheap. It is not of quality and feels foamy. I definitely do not suggest drying this hoodie and lasting very long. Very nice design but don‚Äôt expect it to last long.
2.0,I didn't like the material he was too thin .  Not what I expected at all.
2.0,"weird cut, doesn't fit right, should have for the cost."
2.0,Im 5'4 & its high watered... doesnt cover my feet like the pic. & that is the look i was going for .. will be sending it back
2.0,Back seam ripped after 1 wear to ballet class.
2.0,Would have been perfect if it had the correct number of stars
2.0,Unfortunately didn't fit well. Too big.
2.0,The top was very loose in by size B‚Äôs and the white messy inside material was sticking out the the side of the top. Overall I was not impressed and had to return the suit
2.0,"Slide down pretty easy, not much elastic the colors are beautifully vibrant."
2.0,"Not happy. Right before leaving on a 3 week trip to South America, I purchased this bag to carry my phone and wallet when wearing pants or shorts that don't have pockets. I was hoping to use this bag when walking around town. The bag looks great but the strap bunches between the loops and this makes for an annoying experience. If you are putting a lot of small items in the bag (keys, wallet, phone, coins), you're not going to enjoy having to straighten the strap every few minutes when you reach for items in the bag. Ultimately couldnt use this bag on the trip and ended up being a total waste."
2.0,It was comfy and I liked it however it didn‚Äôt last but a month and it broke off at the bracket.
2.0,Definitely too small so we had to return it.
2.0,The fit was weird and the shoulder had a hole in it. Returned.
2.0,"I had read the reviews and claims on this item indicating its German engineering ""superior"" design, its anti-fog capabilities, its comfort level etc... Well here is my 2 cents after having this product for a few weeks. Take it for what is worth: This sunglass fogs up just like any other sport sunglasses and performs ""in my opinion"" below average. It fogs up even without being engaged in any physical activities just because it sits tightly on your face ""I experience the issue with fogging up even while just driving"".<br /><br />It is not as comfortable as it claims to be since its design over the nose bridge does not have any paddings and actually because of its tight fit pushes against the bridge of your nose and after a while makes you feel uncomfortable and leave a red indentation around your nose.<br /><br />As far as its German Engineering design; I must say I have noticed no difference in quality, workmanship, comfort, optical range etc... in comparison with other sport goggles in this category such as Chinese made products. I would put this item on the mediocre scale.<br /><br />It's lens is nothing to rave about and in comparison to other inexpensive sport goggles that I had owned and seen, fairs mediocre at best. And if it has polarized lenses, it is not of a very high quality as it can hardly be noticed.<br /><br />So the price for this product is not really a saving for a high calibor sport goggle rather paying a bit too much for it."
2.0,"Depending on what you are using this for, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. The seams were already not the best, once you tie it up to tighten the dress, it would pull apart more - and even ripped in some places (although small rips). Don‚Äôt recommend. We ended up using it because it was last minute, but i don‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,"Love the color, it's very soft to the touch, it's comfortable and very fashionable. HOWEVER....the shedding is ridiculous! I was a walking lint ball everywhere I went even though I received many compliments on it throughout the day. At work, I left a trail of lint and fuzz balls at my desk and surrounding areas. It was very distracting and made me very self-conscious. I couldn't wait to get home and take off the poncho and now I'm not even sure that I'll ever wear it again. I should have read the reviews first before purchasing. Lesson learned."
2.0,I don't understand why it is 1inch wider? Credit cards are 2x3.5 not 2x4.5. what do I do with the extra space? Please help me understand so that I may keep the wallet instead of returning it.
2.0,This dress is not a zipper dress. It is not what the description specifies. It is a deep v-front dress. No zipper on any part of the dress.
2.0,Just goofy looking with the clear sides n tinted lenses just plain goofy
2.0,"Thick Thighs save lives not saves.... the end, that is why I could never wear this...."
2.0,"Unfortunately doesn't fit my two-year-old very well. The skirt barely covers her bottom, and if she bends at all, her diaper peeks out. The fabric of the white dress is very sheer, and although there's an underskirt meant to act as a slip, the underskirt only falls to just below her belly button. The puff sleeves are also way too wide at the top and are just floating freely around her shoulders. Thankfully it has little straps, because otherwise it would completely fall off her. It's very wide and loose around her waist, too. The style is cute, but unfortunately it just doesn't work very well for my child's body."
2.0,"We received these as a gift from my niece. She bought them based on the title, where it says ""Women's"" and ""Adult Stocking"" without noticing there are options for Adult and Child's sizes. She sent the Childs size by mistake. Looking at what we received, it would have to be a very small-footed child for them to fit correctly.<br /><br />The socks *are* decorative and colorful. However, we don't see them standing up to much (any?) wear. We did add them to our home decorations, and for that, they work wonderfully!<br /><br />Too bad these are supposed to be socks because these aren't much good for that."
2.0,They were to small.
2.0,I LOVE the purple ones I ordered... but did NOT care for the blue ones. I thought they were the same legging just different color... but the blue ones were an entirely different material and style. The purple ones were thick and compression like... amazing! The blue ones had a material that just wanted to creep into places material should never be (LOL). See the photos... not only are they different material but a different cut... the crotch in the blue ones is just cut weird and uncomfortable (in that way) and that's the last thing I want to be dealing with in the gym.
2.0,"doesn't look good on. shows chubs under stripes. too snug. way too long...i don't want to trip. maybe this would work if you were very tall and very thin. pretty color, but i would die if someone saw me in it. can't return because i am disabled. money down the drain."
2.0,"The armholes were too small to get the ruffle effect, my entire arms stretched it out :(<br />Had potential to be really cute."
2.0,"These gloves do look nice and feel good, but that's really it. They do not fit well, and they do not keep your hands warm. Been wearing them in 30¬∞F weather, and I might as well not worn any gloves. They're decent at blocking direct wind, but so is a cardboard box.<br /><br />I do not recommend these gloves to anyone that want to weather them in cold weather."
2.0,Not cut well. Fits awkward. Runs small
2.0,Not sized correct.
2.0,"The leather is ""sticky"", constantly catching on clothing which pulls the loops off of the arms of the glasses, leaving them dangling and you may not even notice before falling.  The loops don't stay closed on the arms either, cinch them up, but they open back up.  Never had these issues with plain round braided strings."
2.0,Couldn‚Äôt see a difference
2.0,"Would have been a great dress if the pattern wasn‚Äôt lopsided. One hip is higher and more severely cut than the other. The lining is a great fabric and the sequins were full coverage and didn‚Äôt shed. Too bad it was a wonky cut, because otherwise the quality seemed good."
2.0,"Way too tight, and ear holes don‚Äôt align. Do not buy."
2.0,"The dress does not ""fall"" as pictured. One layer and cut straight across. I bought this dress bc I like how the angles with layers shown in the picture. If I was a fan of dropping items off to return, this would have been one. I got the purple and the color is right on"
2.0,"Much shorter than pictured. Also, the arm holes, neck and bottom seam are stretched out. Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. I got the wine color and it is a brighter red than pictured."
2.0,With in 1 or 2 washes the entire hoodie was shedding everywhere. It‚Äôs comfy and nice just looks bad once it gets washed
2.0,"I assumed ""non-slip"" meant there were grips on the soles. Nope. I purchased them as a gift to my son after he moved to a new home with all wood floors and a staircase. I wanted to help keep him safe, and failed. Not a good outcome."
2.0,"thumb ripped open hours after opening the gloves. they were warm; and they looked pretty nice, aside from the torn thumb."
2.0,Item was too small!  I purchased to wear on my thumb when I wear gold jewelry but this was too small. Go up a size
2.0,Worth all of TWO dollars. Dont order this.
2.0,Broke off on first day wearing it
2.0,This is a very short top. It is not as long as they make it look on the picture. I was very disappointed.
2.0,"Too small, even when I ordered a 3xl, best for skinny girls as shown."
2.0,Very thin material and very Small regarding  sizing charts
2.0,I bought this dress in a different color previously and loved it BUT this one isn't made as well and fits funny. I should have returned it but didn't.
2.0,The shirt has a very wide neck which shows my bra straps and I would buy at least 1 or 2 sizes bigger because the neck is very wide.
2.0,It would not click in correctly with the actual watch device. I have had lost it several times as it just fell of my wrist without my knowing. I loved the material of the band but poor quality to stay securely fastened.
2.0,"Cheap chiffon, feels stiff. Also a hole in the side seam on the first wear. Pretty pattern but doesn't feel great on."
2.0,Cheap construction had them a few days and the button broke already.
2.0,There small and tend to fall off of my ear they look nice if only they stayed on wasn't very happy
2.0,"I am 5'0&#34; and 119 lbs.  I purchased a large, and they're almost too small."
2.0,Major probs with zippers getting constantly stuck (not fun when you have horse poop all over them and you are struggling w/ a 3yo who wants them off NOW!
2.0,"The dress came in an orderly fashion but it looks rumpled and there‚Äôs a small stain on the bust. I don‚Äôt know if it was worn previously but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this dress to anyone. The design is off, it fit fine but I won‚Äôt be wearing it, most likely returning."
2.0,It just kept fallingboff my ear. I couldn't bjust keep it there
2.0,"Fit on this dress was bizarre.<br />The fabric bunches up on the thighs and the straps on this dress were completely misshapen, parts of it wide and then really thin. I was so excited for this dress but it was just not well made. The return process has been easy, though so I don't blame the seller."
2.0,Hard to wear b/c the neckline is SO big
2.0,This was too small and definitely not something that works if you have any hips! I thought there might be some stretch to the material but not enough to be comfortable wearing for any length of time and it is quite short which leaves little to the imagination. I'll wear it for those special moments!
2.0,Bloomers unraveled on first wear. üëéüèª Blouse is fine.
2.0,It as a hole in the collar
2.0,Looks like  PJs. Grateful for the free return.
2.0,"Cheaply made, and not effective in keeping out the dirt."
2.0,I can't wear this. It's like they forgot to cut an opening for your head to go through.  It's heavier because it's doubled. So it's more like a shawl. Shipping took forever and I feel I wasted $28; but I certainly am not paying shipping bank to China.  Definitely not what I was hoping for.
2.0,cute but broke really easily
2.0,Don‚Äôt hold up on face look like  patch been slap on it
2.0,Showed up exactly like the picture but I wear a 7.5 medium to wide and the 8 was way too small. For the price and hassle of returning I will donate.
2.0,Fit was too small
2.0,"This is NOT a good belt. The buckle/clasp does not stay tight. The webbing is fine, but the buckle is garbage. I'm a 34ish waist (true) & I constantly have to cinch this belt. I wouldn't buy it again."
2.0,"I've only worn them a few times, and they are already getting holes in the seam by the ankle."
2.0,Too wide for my nose.
2.0,Shirt will shrink some.  It is a typical cheap t-shirt.  The length will shrink and get wider.
2.0,It‚Äôs not as chunky as the picture suggests so I‚Äôm kind of disappointed and I‚Äôll need to figure out how to style this since it‚Äôs small
2.0,"Watch looks great and functions how it‚Äôs supposed to (sort of) although it tells time. The design is straight garbage. The clasp is in a location that can be hit from everything. You put on a glove, the clasp will unlock it, you make a fist, it‚Äôll unlock it, you put on a jacket or your clothes, it snags the clasp and unlocks it. It‚Äôs annoying that I spend about 20x a day closing the clasp. Whoever thought of engineering it this way is a complete moron."
2.0,"Fell apart after 1st wash, thread open up in lower half cutting sock virtually in half (not even on a seam).  Ended up sending back"
2.0,Too long poorly made
2.0,Fit pretty good. I liked the length. The material wasn‚Äôt as nice and strong as it looks like in the picture. Cheap looking and feeling. There was a bright white string inside the dark colored string that made the looker cheaper looking. Returned.
2.0,Kids love it. Colors are not same as image. Zipper pocket broke in like 5 seconds.
2.0,Very nice looking shoe.  Really hurt my feet.
2.0,socks were itchy and not comfortable.
2.0,"Photochromic abilities are non-existent.<br />They came with the darker shade, permanent without changing at all.<br />During the day this is fine, but at evening or in the shadows they become too dark for using.<br />Also they are too big for women  face (I bought them for my wife)."
2.0,The color of the truck and the red trim are not the same. T he shirt runs very small
2.0,"These are ok, you get what you pay for. I only kept them because they were so low in price. They fit how you would except and are relatively comfortable. The quality isn‚Äôt the best as there are loose threads and even with proper laundering the fabric pills rather quickly. These undergarments serve their function however I wouldn‚Äôt let anyone see them on me. I definitely regard them as cheap underwear to be worn on lazy, down days. My advice though is to avoid them if you can, look for something that has more quality and style even if that costs a little more money.it will pay off in the long run."
2.0,"This is a perfect summer dress for hanging around at the pool or at a barbecue. It is super lightweight super thin material but since there's two layers you can't see through it. The lightweight fabric Allows it to flow and look very &quot;summer-y&quot;. You could wear it with a belt or not, and just a pair of sandals and you're ready to go. I have only worn it once and haven't washed it a lot so I don't know how it will hold up in the washer. It might be one of those things that you want to wash on gentle cycle<br /><br />UPDATE- I washed this once - normal cycle, but with other light clothing.  It ripped in theee places at the seams. It just kind of fell apart. Changed my rating based on this."
2.0,cute bag but very poor quallity. the strap around the buckle tore off the second day I used it
2.0,"Just got these and tried them on. If you're looking for compression, this isn't it. It only lays on your skin flat and that's about it. It doesn't taper your chest in nor feel tight around certain spots. It's just regular under clothing vest."
2.0,THESE ARE HUGE!!!!!!
2.0,"I wish there was a way to change the size of this. It looks like a great product, but its just too big and I cannot adjust the size."
2.0,"don't liked, poor quality!"
2.0,"They look nice and seem like they would be comfortable, but I suggest going up 2 sizes."
2.0,Very cheap looking metal and very tiny.
2.0,"I bought this for a Mother of the bride outfit!<br />My Mother loved it, except the top was way too big on her.  The pants and jacket fit her fine.<br />We had to get the top taken in to fit her right.<br />That‚Äôs why I gave it two stars!"
2.0,"Fit was snug and I ordered a large, usually wear a med.  Material is super thin and design is printed on.  Returned"
2.0,"I let myself by guided by other reviewers AND by the Amazon size chart.  This product is NOT AT ALL the size in the chart, and turned out to be too big.  I would exchange it, but the smell is terrible.  I can't even bear the thought of taking it out of the bag again."
2.0,It is cut to short around the arm/shoulder part and cuts into your skin. It also doesn‚Äôt have enough support around the stomach area. Just a bad product
2.0,Bought as a gift and my mother wore it twice and the clasp is broken already. She doesn't wear it to bed and takes it off when home. Very disappointed in quality of the chain. The pendant itself is very nice.
2.0,I THOUGHT THESE WERE FOR EACH SHOE X 10 DIFFERANT COLORS. ITS JUST 2 SMALL STRIPS PER COLOR. LIKE I GURSS FOR 1 EYE. NOT WHAT I THOUGHT AT ALL.
2.0,Horrible just horrible there is different color of blue stings popping out and the gold piece are falling off.
2.0,Size up if you can
2.0,if you want it to be fit as on the picture you should be  5.3 hight with 120 pounds weight
2.0,"Way too small, at least two or three sizes smaller than labeled."
2.0,"Yikes! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 150lbs. I read the reviews like crazy before deciding to order this. I was directed to get an XL as they ‚Äúrun small‚Äù.<br /><br />Firstly... I want what‚Äôs on the model. It looks like nice soft material, and the legs go all the way down to the ankle. What I received was a hard canvas like material (you definitely don‚Äôt want to wash this in a machine and probably don‚Äôt want to dry it either). I put it on and it‚Äôs like a Capri VERY SHORT!!!! The straps are adjustable but they don‚Äôt give you enough material to make it long enough to look like it does in the photo.<br /><br />Not only that but I literally waited FOREVER for this thing in the mail.<br /><br />It‚Äôs made in China but I don‚Äôt know where it ships from.<br /><br />I was REALLY looking forward to wearing this but I just can‚Äôt. XL fits like an XS. I normally wear a medium in jumpsuits like this. So order if you‚Äôre bold but make sure you order many sizes bigger than you. I think they were made for kids.<br /><br />So mad for my wait on this item and even madder that I cant even wear it."
2.0,"They don't last long, they ripped to easily for office wear."
2.0,It looks amazing in the picture but it has an awful fit. Its pokey and uncomfortable. I was looking for a ‚Äòpretty‚Äô bra that will support bigger chests. This isnt it.
2.0,"I was so looking forward to these shirts for summer for a teen, 14. Reading reviews, ordered 16-18, knowing they run small. However, these are super small! More like 10-12, won‚Äôt work for us!! ü•∫"
2.0,These jeans are so skinny around the calves and ankles that I could barely get my foot through.
2.0,"This shirt is tight on the arms, because if I say raise me arms, they rise up. It just makes it a very uncomfortable shirt to wear. I wish I had sized up like 2 sizes. It‚Äôs too firm fitted for me."
2.0,"Cheaply made. Ton of string from the seams hanging everywhere and needs cleaned up. Otherwise, fits well and as expected. Good anime top."
2.0,"I ordered the package of ten, and of these, three were broken straight from the box. My daughter pointed out to me that on one of them, the chain was made wrong, so that you couldn't actually open the clasp."
2.0,"I KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE COMPASS,  I CANT WEAR IT!"
2.0,Too big for my ears and won't bend. Gave it away to my grandson. Hope it fits him better. Like the looks of it.
2.0,"The golden watch started turning silver color in less than a month, so now it looks old because it's so faded."
2.0,Muy peque√±o!
2.0,"I got this ring in black, on November 29th, and now on January it already lost almost all the black plated. Ring‚Äôs design is very beautiful, is a shame it lost color so fast."
2.0,Clasp is very difficult to open and not easily opened with one hand.
2.0,These are very thick and are a very awkward fit. It is hard to communicate because of how thick they are. The clear plastic dogs up easily as well.
2.0,"This doesn't fit like it should. Very small, so I would go up at least one size. I was very disappointed because the material is sooooo soft, oh well."
2.0,"The fit is good and it looks nice, but I notice after a little use the sweater got little balls all over it."
2.0,One of the lenses was out was able to pop it in but there‚Äôs a gap.
2.0,"The rings have a great design, but tarnish very quickly."
2.0,"That wallet isn't what I expected.  It's a simple black, sparkly, metallic looking wallet with a batman patch glued on.  I haven't even used it because I'm afraid the patch is going to rip off the moment my young child gets a hold of it.  So I'm disappointed."
2.0,I don‚Äôt see how these can be unisex.  This fits tighter than expected so I don‚Äôt see how they would ever fit a man.
2.0,This dress is beautiful but runs very small
2.0,"This looks like a jewel  but I was HIGHLY disappointed in the overall quality . I JUST HAD to send it back... was not a wise choice !  If you are in the market for a nice timepiece and on a budget, keep looking !"
2.0,The earrings are cute for the price but the backs are awful.  I would probably not have bought them if I'd known.  The backs are ridiculously small and I've only worn pairs from the set a couple of times and lost three backs trying to put them on or take them off.
2.0,"I Normally wear a size small, but I read the reviews and decided to order a large.  When my order arrived, it was a size 3XL.  I tried it on just to see how it fit, and it almost didn‚Äôt button across my chest... clearly these run more than a bit small."
2.0,These are really long and baggie and very thin material. I doubt they will hold up well.
2.0,This item is beautiful but was delivered broken
2.0,The size is not true to size. I'd say that these shirts run small. The material is not very soft. The material is very perforated. Also these shirts show sweat marks REALLY REALLY bad.
2.0,This dress came to me dirty and looked like it was worn before. Fit not as expected and very cheap material
2.0,"When I first received these socks 1 month ago I was very happy with them since they were comfortable, soft and seemed perfect for the amount of hiking I do throughout the week. However, after only a few weeks several of the heels started to tear and blow out while I was hiking. These trails are NOT extremely demanding and I'm very disappointed with the overall quality of these socks. I think socks should last more than a few hikes and wash cycles."
2.0,EDIT: My first band arrived split at the connector. It was replaced. Within 2 weeks my second band also split. I‚Äôm not rough on my bands nor have a had an issue with any other style of band prior. Love the color combos but the quality is very poor.
2.0,"Unfortunately when I received this dress I was very disappointed and will be returning it. It didn't fit as expected, despite my success with other dresses of this style. It also was uncomfortable, fitting too tightly in the wrong spots. Additionally, I bought this expecting a nice red color for the holidays, as shown in the photo, but it was much deeper in person."
2.0,"This sucked. I loved it when I got it and instantly put it on my dog and my necklace. 2 weeks later, the black in both mine and her‚Äôs letters had come out. The ‚Äúsilver‚Äù had also faded from where it had been rubbing. A week later, my dog‚Äôs piece ended up missing. Not worth the money I spent AT ALL! It was so cheaply made"
2.0,"The white shorts are completely see through.. sorry you had to see that. Another flaw on the white shorts is the left pocket stitching. The right pocket has a much larger opening than the left pocket due to faulty stitching.<br /><br />The grey shorts were fine, feels good and flexible. Can do high kicks and squats with them on. Do not know how durable they will be in the long run or after a few washes.<br /><br />Since white shorts are see through I have to return both. Wont be buying from them again if their product pictures are inaccurate."
2.0,The elastic is too tight.  I can‚Äôt wear them.
2.0,"Wonderful fit, but the fabric was so thin, I could see my skin beneath it. I'd love this dress in a good fabric"
2.0,"The top is adorable.<br />The bottom is obscene! You can see every nook and cranny, and I aint no english muffin! #CTC<br />Keeping for the top, but threw the bottom in the trash.  I could never wear this in public."
2.0,It is good but it is to dark
2.0,I think it is not made well.  The sizing just isn‚Äôt right for me.
2.0,I wish we had the option of having the package the image shows for the price. One strap is a bit pricey
2.0,"Good pricing, but you get what you pay for.  Where the band attaches to the watch, the material or tolerances make the fit loose.  Putting the watch on pulls on the connections so that after on, it feels as if the band is simply going to pull directly out; not slide out as is the intended design. Given the risk to the watch falling off, the risk in saving money isn't worth the potential cost if the band fails."
2.0,Too tight around the waist area!
2.0,It until I washed it then the dress died . It seem like it but it's shape nothing will get the wrinkles out I hate ironing and it doesn't work on this anyways . I was so happy when I got it but after washing it and having it stretch out so much I would suggest sizing down . I always size up because I have larger in the chest but it seems like this just got wider and shorter in the wash and I only used cold water at it and I did a delicate wash and it was in a mesh clothing net just so it wouldn't get fuzzball side it from the other stuff in my wash . I bought a bunch of dresses like this and after the first the first wash it's starting to happen to all of them no matter which company I bought them from . It's happening to the ones with the short sleeves the ones with the pockets I'm just very disappointed in the style right now .
2.0,Had about 3 months and things keep breaking on it. The adjustable strap and the zipper pulls keep coming off which caused one zipper to break completely. I was hoping this bag would be better quality because it was the only one big enough for what I needed that I actually liked the look of.
2.0,Why no L?
2.0,was a size small and fit very big
2.0,"This is a Softback Case and the case itself is not bad.  Great for Safety Glasses! Do not use if you are protecting expensive glasses!  If you are active, you need to have this case placed into a protective environment.  I'm using it for Blue Mirrored Aviator Sunglasses and had it hanging from my Coach Backpack.  No more!  Now it goes inside the backpack.  As you can see in the photo the material that attaches to the Clip just Blew Apart!  And the case went its way, as I went mine.  Thank goodness for honest people."
2.0,"No way, and it's kind of see through"
2.0,"The bracelet rusted after about 2 weeks of wear and shipping under prime, it came weeks late since it had to come through customs."
2.0,"I did my measurements and got the appropriate size according to their size chart, I even went up a few inches to give me so wiggle/growing space. When they arrived, I could just barely zip and button them up. On top of me getting the ‚Äúright size‚Äù When I ordered them, I had a drastic drop in my weight in a matter of 3 days, now weighting 114lbs. I was 130lbs at the time of purchase. Most of the weight was lost in the area that are tight when wearing the shorts. I was worried when they arrived that they be too big now, but it was still the opposite. Soo the sizing chart could use some Major updating...."
2.0,These are cute earrings but didn't get a chance to use them. The stem broke off so easily.
2.0,I really don't like that the ends aren't finshed. The cloth is just cut so the brim exposes the black cloth between the red.
2.0,I've always liked pearl and pearl like clips bu these look rather cheap looking
2.0,Doesn't fit how it's supposed to. Fits like a normal beanie.
2.0,"Love the color and style, but the material was very clingy and almost sheer. It would probably look adorable on my 13 year old, but wasn't a good choice for me."
2.0,The material was not what I was expecting.
2.0,I read reviews of others and chose a large given that I'm very busty but if you are short then it won't fit
2.0,Only got 3 patterns. I expected more patterns
2.0,"Super beautiful, but poorly made. I wore the plain rose gold one for not even one week before the metal turned green. Some of them have dents in the metal, and a couple of the bars are too small  + some have misaligned jewels. Super disappointed."
2.0,"the lenses fell out pretty easily, which got to be annoying"
2.0,"We're pretty and arrived on time, but screws  worked themselves out within a couple of weeks. Would not buy again."
2.0,"I didn't like the cheap, old-fashioned polyester fabric of the bodice of this blouse. The fabric of the sleeves was fine. I might have considered it if was about a $10 shirt, but not for around $25. Also, the ""pouf"" at the top of the sleeves wasn't a look I enjoy. Returned.<br />The fit was appropriate. I normally wear a medium in US sizes, and the medium fit me in this blouse."
2.0,Nothing like the picture. XL was as big as a US small or medium. Was more like an apron than a cover up or dress.
2.0,They are light and great for the summer but the back ripped the 3rd time i wore them. CHEAP
2.0,Have had one zipper break and one tie has come apart completely. Both with the first time wearing them...
2.0,"The mix of metals is great, but they are so hard to open!!"
2.0,Picture didn't really capture how big the earrings really are. Pearls were bigger than I thought. I needed smaller for the wedding I was in.
2.0,Too Short too tight but work great over boots
2.0,This dress is really cute the fit is perfect but it is compl√©tele see through. The only thing I can imagine wearing this to is the pool
2.0,"Cute, but the balls don‚Äôt stay on and one of the bars wasn‚Äôt full smoothed out and had a sharp edge so I couldn‚Äôt use it at all."
2.0,Nearly see through material.
2.0,"I bought this for summer and am disappointed to see that it was misrepresented as ""breathable"" fabric.<br /><br />It's heavy, not breathable.<br /><br />It also looks like a shiny pajama top, not like the shirt in the pictures."
2.0,Cute and cozy but super small and ordered a 2 x! I only wear a x-large.
2.0,"Super cute! The top fit as expected, but the skirt was super short (I am 5'9&#34;). Had to give it away to a friend because it fit more like a shirt on me!"
2.0,"Really like the ring, have had some problems, as the metal on the ends of the wires have loosened and now it catches on clothes.  I have tried to re crip the ends with no success, so do not wear it.  any more"
2.0,The dress was pretty and the material was nice but the zipper was broken...wouldnt stay up.
2.0,Very cheap quality. Do not buy. I bought similar crocs alternatives from other vendors on Amazon and this one is by far he worse I've purchsed.
2.0,"I loved the idea of having an AirTag compartment built into my wallet until I purchased this. Just about a week of use and almost half of the threading holding the AirTag pocket together has completely torn out, causing the Tag itself to slip into my pocket fairly frequently. The rest of the wallet is doable quality for the price, but the AirTag section is pathetic."
2.0,"I don't hate it, but it didn't have a flattering fit for me. It ran too long. I do like the elastic band and it feels comfortable to wear. I should've sized down. Color is also nice."
2.0,"I received this less then a month ago and I've worn it three times. It fits, and it's reasonably comfortable. Unfortunately, the stitching on the seams is already pulling apart in several places. I've repaired the existing problems, but at this rate I do not expect this to be wearable for more then another month or two.<br /><br />I assume that this is poor quality manufacturing, and I will not purchase additional clothing from this manufacturer."
2.0,Very cheap material. Very small
2.0,The fit is terrible and the fabric is not soft. Very scratchy.
2.0,Cute and loved everything about it but arms are too short...way too short.
2.0,"Purchased a PD-1685 with grey face, and in the advertised photos, was supposed to have a clear caseback and NH35a movement. Watch I received had a solid back and an Epson YN55a movement within...which yes, I opened to verify. The Epson features hacking capability, manual winding like the NH and same bph, but 20 vs 22 jewel and is different than what is being advertised. It is still a nice watch and comfortable/no sharp edges on the band, but buy somewhere else if you are expecting to get what you see in the advertised pics and don't want to go through the hassle of returning it if it doesn't match.<br /><br />2 Stars due to watch received being different from watch advertised."
2.0,Bottoms are not  good design. The band doesn't stretch.
2.0,The shoe arrived as expected but not sure if they are a real pair of stride rite shoes because the 2nd day they were worn the stitching started to unravel which in turn makes me question the validity of this product I have been and avid purchaser of Stride Rite products and I have never witnessed this ever occurring in any shoe that I have purchased directly from the store.
2.0,"Cute slippers but little tread on bottom of shoe, and child says they are slippery when she walks."
2.0,Far too small for my taste. Returned
2.0,Does not have clasps and no stretch so good luck getting it on and it fitting appropriately. Cheap flimsy fabric
2.0,These are very thin and poorly made.  The pockets were put on backwards so I got a defective product.  I will not purchase these again.
2.0,"Two stars for being pretty, but no more because the design is completely flawed.<br /><br />Whoever designed this forgot that the Vivoactive HR has a built in 3-axis magnetic compass, which is vital for the navigation to work, as well as things like the compass widget. The magnet clip, that holds this wrist band together, is strong enough to make the compass swivel around like crazy.<br /><br />Returning this."
2.0,Very cheap quality but they look nice
2.0,"Just awful fit. Somehow it is both too tight and baggy. I‚Äôm a size 6 waist with 36DDD chest- this was tight on my chest, baggy under the arms and throughout the sleeves. The ‚Äúwaist‚Äù  was empire and was so poorly fitted that no amount of belting could save my figure. Ultimately gave it away.<br /><br />Fabric is soft and warm."
2.0,If you're planning on wearing the extension regularly I would not recommend this product. The gold paint wore off quickly and then the extension broke off after about 2 weeks of wearing it nonstop.
2.0,"funny logo as I loved the tv show but this hat is awkwardly small, definitely for a small child in my opinion"
2.0,Still trying to find the right shoe that this will fit into. It is so wide at the base as most Birkenstocks are it does not translate into non-Birkenstock shoes
2.0,"Quality not as expected, the inside  peeled out after first use"
2.0,"You are NOT protecting your clothes in any way when you are cooking and wearing these almost-cheesecloth aprons. They are cute maybe for a photo prop???<br /><br />I bought these wondering what they were going to be like. Such adorable prints - I took the chance. I wasn't disappointed, but I realized what you get when you pay so little! I make things out of quality cotton fabrics from stores here in the U.S. and never encounter such low quality, thin ""cotton"" fabrics. It makes me sad, but I totally get now what you are getting when you pay so little. It is sad."
2.0,I wore them to the barn a handful of times and when i took them off the lining came apart
2.0,"I ordered a large and was sent a SM/Med, nice style but need to return."
2.0,"To be honest, I ordered these mostly because I liked the color. Turns out they're not the color it showed, in the picture there's a light pink with  little blue at the edge, but what I received was a brighter pink with no blue. Plus these glasses are kinda heavy and slide off your face."
2.0,"One of the sets broke apart right as I was putting the earring in. The ones that dangle aren't designed as shown in the picture. The moons are going in the same direction. Not a big deal, but not how I wanted them to look. I had multiple peoe point out that my earring ""was twisted"", so it was obvious that it woukd have looked better as pictured. The backs are also not very secure."
2.0,"This purse had everything I wanted...EXCEPT it was just way to big for me! I looked at the size, even got out my tape measure and though it would work, but once I had it in my hands, NO WAY, way too big, it would've been like carrying a suitcase with me. No thank you."
2.0,I did not like the style of this dress. Actually it looks somewhat ok in picture but actually it looks very plain and that buttons on sleeves make it bad. And that fish cut in the middle does not look trendy.
2.0,"Update: I had to return this item due to finding a hole in the bladder and was unable to actually use outside a testing in my house.<br /><br />This Hydration bladder is really cool. I have not seen a larger capacity such as this one that also opens up at the top in order to air out and clean. I does come with a cleaning wand which comes in handy for the bag. The Line onto the pack is weird because it screws onto the bladder which I have not seen before. I have always had the easy snap lock line for my bladders, but it is more secure this way, but also difficult when having a line that is fed through a backpack because it has to be twist in order to be attached instead of the snapping in and just going. It does suck that I cannot use my other lines with this bag, Since I have a FLEXLINE HYDRATION SYSTEM as well which bends to stay in place the fact that I can't use the pretty common attachment makes it a single bag type without switching depending on the activity.The extra liter capacity over normal is nice to have for my longer hikes in the desert. If I can find this size, bag style, with the normal snap loc mechanism I would love it but Since this doesn't have it I might just have to keep looking. I was surprise how it hold water in the pack at the top since it just comes apart with the slide tube in place.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM TO TRY AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (IN ORDER TO LEAVE AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW, SO IF I GIVE THE PRODUCT ONE, IT MEANS IT DESERVES IT ON IT'S OWN MERIT. ALL OF THE REVIEWS I WRITE ARE MY OWN AND I NEVER ALLOW ANYONE OR ANYTHING TO INFLUENCE THEM IN ANY WAY"
2.0,Said 18 kt gold.  After it arrived it said PLATED  lied to again here on amazon
2.0,"Bought these for when it snows, to keep warm when running errands.<br />Pros:<br />Soft material.<br />Cons:<br />These are not long enough to tuck into the collar of a jacket. Doesn't even reach my shoulder, like mid neck length which allows the neck to get cold.<br />The area for you head is rather small but then bells out bigger around the chin area and around the neck, making it baggy and oddly fitting.<br />There is a fob to tighten it but it gets tight in an odd area right below the chin, so it crams the fabric in front of my face, pulls the top down so I am constantly trying to get it out of my eyes, and is uncomfortable around my throat.<br />And the strip of fabric meant to cover the bottom half of your face is too loose to accomplish any sort of protection against the snow/cold.<br />It's the same quality as something you would buy from a Dollar General Store.<br />Disappointed. You get what you pay for."
2.0,Runs very very small. Ended up giving them away.
2.0,material was too bad.. also i received a defective saree.
2.0,I didn't pay attention to the size. Small so I am returning them. They are perfect for an adolescent. They are very pretty. I will now try to replace them.
2.0,"I will be using these for a short trip and wanted something very portable and compact.<br />If I am very careful they will hold up, but not only do I imagine them scratching quickly but because they don‚Äôt fold completely back into the outer case, I see them breaking in half if I don‚Äôt store them in some type of case. Wearing them around my neck is not going to work due to the glasses not folding properly."
2.0,I was so excited for this belly button ring but the bar was way too short which made it feel super tight and made the wings of the first bat jab into my belly button. it was so uncomfortable my piercing of 3 years started feeling infected but healed immediately once i took this ring out and put in my old one. don‚Äôt waste your money
2.0,"It looks better in the picture, its fragile and looks really cheap, it broke as soon as i open it..."
2.0,"Very strange size. The cups are WAY high, and there's too much material bunching and gathering in the torso. Very strange suit. I returned it. Too bad too, because it's super cute in the pictures."
2.0,Loooks can be betray these earrings are not all that big i brought these and i wish i didnt .
2.0,The back has scratches on it like it was used. But it look nice.
2.0,"Too sheer. I returned it because who in their right mind wanting to stay cool in the summer by purchasing a cotton dress would ever consider wearing a slip (and then sweating more)?!? Not what I wanted. It was strange, though, because the blue polka dot color is awesome and not sheer at all. My advice: avoid the red color unless you want to wear a slip."
2.0,Getting in this bra was hard! My size is a 36C it feels way smaller than a 36C
2.0,The use seems great but it's a pretty cheap material and very stiff and the inside color wasn't that great for me.
2.0,I really loved these dream catchers they were awesome I am sure I will buy many more in the future. That being said. They collect so much dust and turn dark pretty fast. As I moved out of my apartment I noticed how dusty they were because they left really bad marks on my wall that I could not scub off no matter how hard I tried. Had to paint of the spots. Not sure what happened here.
2.0,"Cheap quality. I'm not sure what about it makes it &#34;RFID-blocking&#34;, feels/appears likes your average wallet you'd pick up at a Freddys or Walmart. It's pretty flimsy. If you're looking for a boring single use 'throw-away' wallet, this is it. I purchased for an upcoming trip, I'm not expecting to hold up for the duration of the trip. But it's not work the hassle of returning. It'll make a great wallet for some child's imaginary play/ dress-up.<br />To sum it up: you get what you pay for; cheap is cheap, Plain & Simple."
2.0,These run very small. I'm not sure who does the sizing but there is no way these are made to fit a XXL size. They look like they were made for children. The bottom was uneven also. I do not recommend.
2.0,"The description clearly states that the color is Pink, however, it is Peach. It is going back."
2.0,"One of the gems had fallen out when I received the package. Kind of disappointed by that. Otherwise, alright quality."
2.0,"I was disappointed in that they are very flimsy.  I love case and I like the spring thing, but the frames are too small."
2.0,I was very disappointed by how small the earrings were! Otherwise they are very nice looking
2.0,"Cute outfit, but only came with one outfit. Fits TTS."
2.0,It looks and feels like a childs toy.
2.0,"Kind of disappointed in these glasses and they are going back.  For me, it's hard to tell from measurements online, but these are oversized frames, so be aware.  They are flimsy frames, and the lenses are not very dark.  I want full sun protection (especially if I am spending money on polarized lenses) and these are not nearly dark enough.  Your eyes can be seen through them if that helps describe it.  I will say they come nicely boxed from the company.  They come wrapped in plastic, then in a nice case which is hard on lens side, soft the rest of the way around, slightly felted on the inside, with a snap closure.  Also included in the box is a satiny, branded pouch to carry your glasses in.  Sadly, this cannot make up for the poor quality and design of these glasses."
2.0,"Fit nice, but after a few uses the Brest area changed color!  Can‚Äôt use."
2.0,Wish they would've fit right......
2.0,I read the reviews before I purchased and ultimately it was small and snug. I think I would have been fine with ordering my typical size. I usually wear an 8 sometimes 7.5 depending on brand and do not have wide feet.
2.0,"Make sure you look at the size guide and measurements. The sizes are way off. The material is not soft and very thin. Yes it is meant to be flowy, but it is very stiff and almost feels like crepe paper. Not sure why I even tried this piece, not up to a good Quality Standard."
2.0,They run way too big and are also too heavy. Especially for my 2yr olds. Returned them.
2.0,"It‚Äôs ok. Not ideal for work as it was not as thick, looks and feels slick. But will work for workouts."
2.0,It was great for about a no then and then completely fell apart with regular use
2.0,"Unfortunately, these did not help with the ""halo's"" and the bright lights in making a difference. I was really hopeful, but I tried them several evenings/nights with the same outcome. Would love it if I could find a pair of glasses that worked."
2.0,I think it is more of a child size üòû
2.0,I didn't realize how small the earrings were.  I never would have purchased them.
2.0,This handbag is way too small.  It does not expand and needs to be one inch larger all around - My wallet does not fit.
2.0,"I was really looking forward to wearing this with leggings and boots, but it's super tight in the upper arm and won't button all the way down. It definitely does not fit like expected."
2.0,"Stone is a very, very light green.  Pretty I suppose, but not at all like the photo.  I understand that colors vary with stones, but this is really different.  The color of the chain looks really cheap, too.  I can use another chain, but not sure I like the light green stone for anything."
2.0,"I knew for the price not to expect a 5 star necklace but I liked the look of it, the key is pretty and is a good size, the chain however would have been better if it had not been tied with a black twist tie, it caused the metal to tarnish in the spots it was tied on. I can switch the chain but still disappointed by that."
2.0,Appears and feels cheap. I would look elsewhere.
2.0,Buyer be ware ... know your True size. The manufacturer would only give me 50% off . The board shorts were tight as well as the top . Quality was great just sucks they would not return .
2.0,Waist band has very little elastic and I have to constantly pull them up.
2.0,These actually fit well except they are too short and my son is relatively small for a 6 year old so I'm surprised. I'll need to take the hem out to see if they can work.
2.0,I will be returning this shirt-- it was way too small. Not an xxl !!!
2.0,Item runs big. Extremely thin this would be a very hot summer day top only.
2.0,"It's shapeless, like a big rectangle. Nothing like it's picture. Not flattering at all. Very soft, and maybe with a belt or something."
2.0,XL is too small for a women size 11.5 foot. High chemical smell. Heavy.
2.0,Very cute bathing suit... In the front!  But the back skirt was very short.  Reminded me of a ruffled bathing suit bottom for a baby.  Needed to come down lower.
2.0,"These do not sound anything like a guitar or anything to do with music. The sound you get is a loud screeching noise instead of a guitar and you cannot use the light without the sound.  It is very frustrating because they are very cute and the light works great but who wants to have a loud screeching noise every time they turn on the flash light.  Very disappointed, especially since they are not really returnable because the cost to send them to China would be on me."
2.0,The sandals are very well made but run extremely small. I would wager to say about two sizes to small.
2.0,"I like this tote but the stitching around the inside clasp is coming loose.  I can't return it because it started tearing two days after the 30 day window. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.  I have purchased several Big Buddha purses and have like them all.  Disappointed in this return policy."
2.0,Fits but not like expected.
2.0,"I LOVE the look of the big dangly ones! But within 6 months they are discolored and have a bronze tint around them, and one of them broke off where the plug is welded to the ring.  I always take them out at night, but I did keep one of the smaller pairs in over night and they were killing my ears by the next morning! They were itchy and full of gunk, and I had made sure to clean both the plugs and my ears with peroxide before using them. Disappointed!"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:efc76f3c80ecab3e3c72d84ce6d04d4d]] The instructions are simple but cannot set the time or date. The buttons don‚Äôt seem to do what it says. Will be returning. Useless without being able to set the time
2.0,"I purchased the wine color and it was true to color from the picture.  It was a cute, well constructed shirt make sure to size down as it is huge.  I am large up top and it hung weird and then ballooned out around stomach- like a maternity top.  I had to return."
2.0,great colors wanted to like but sagged in the rear too loose
2.0,Looked good in the picture but it just seemed a bit shapeless on me
2.0,Bought these for Christmas.. sadly as soon as summer rolled around my toddler bent them too far and a side broke off. They were super cute.
2.0,Very low quality wtth poor workmanship. Had hard time even putting them on because of the loose threads from the diamond pattern.  At least the price was decent. Doubtfull they will ever be used.
2.0,"UNFINISHED PRODUCT. NOT SUITABLE FOR GIFT, ESP FOR LITTLE GIRLS. BEAD TOPS HALF OFF NYLON STUD & NYLON STUDS WEREN'T FINISHED. MOST HAD EXTRA NYLON MATERIALS ATTATCHED & SOME TOO DULL OR TOO SHARP. DO NOT FEEL THAT I CAN SAFELY GIVE THESE AS GIFTS TO MY NEICES AND DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT I COULD WEAR THEM EITHER."
2.0,"Fit was good but disappointed at the inseam length. Amazon description said medium, 6"" inseam but the inseam is short. Will keep to wear at home only."
2.0,"Fit great but the flap is two parts with a split in the back, exposing the base of my neck which is what I wanted covered"
2.0,"It is recommended to order a size bigger but it'sore like 2 sizes. They look good, feel scratchy and fit us awful."
2.0,"There are good and bad things about these shoes, however the bad outweighs the good. The measurements you send will be the ones they use. If you give exact measurements they may not fit the best. I made this mistake and they were quite snug. The height that you send is where the boot is going to lay, and if you want them to go above your knee like in the series measure above your knee. Furthermore, I am a cosplayer and try to go to cons several times a year. I got these last year and they worked fine, and it isn't like I wore them constantly. However, as time went on the seams on top of my foot started to rip and I had to re-sew it and then later I had to repeat this on the other boot. The zipper on one of the boots ripped away the boot and I was unable to zip it up at all. I was quite upset with this and I might have to get new boots within a year of having purchased these. I expected these would last longer considering the price. Also, the boots do not have comfort soles so I recommend purchasing them if you don't want your feet to hurt."
2.0,The stone had a visible scratch. Returning.
2.0,so short it wont cover a bra
2.0,"Super curate style but the material is cheap, and see through."
2.0,I thought these were wayyyyyyy bigger! :'/ cute though.
2.0,"Great look but you can‚Äôt see out of this thing. Like at all. I tried wearing this on Halloween and it was only wearable if I was standing still with something to hold on to for balance. I would not recommend for anything you require sight for. If you use echo location to fine your way around, this may be the mask for you."
2.0,NO. NO. NO.  I have used this coin purse for years and years. The size IS SMALLER!!!!!  My credit cards and even my drivers license do NOT FIT!!  Such a disappointment!!!!!
2.0,Only for show. These boots are incredibly uncomfy even with insoles.
2.0,"It doesn't match what you see. It's like a school bus lol. Also the material is not what expected either. It's comfy but it's like pajamas not ""wearing out ""comfy."
2.0,"The shoe is fine.  The shipping time was fast too long, even with knowing it would take a while.  It surpassed the window of time by a lot."
2.0,Looks much cheaper in reality
2.0,Very pretty but the elastic was too tight and I felt like it was going to snap everytime I went to put it on so I ended up replacing the elastic with ribbon and it works just fine but I mean price was right!
2.0,"I liked the fabric, it seemed like nice cotton but the pockets stuck out. Like a lot. I could not get them to do anything other than bunch out. Maybe it was just this one dress but I couldn‚Äôt keep it."
2.0,"The mask is OK, fis well, etc. I was disappointed, though, that the mask is purple. Duke's school colors are dark navy blue and white, which is what I expected."
2.0,$5 sunglasses with a $15 box
2.0,"Pretty dress & fit as expected.  However, the lace on the top is completely different than what was shown in the advertised picture.  Also, the picture shows cap sleeves, but the dress I received is sleeveless."
2.0,It feels like a kids dress in fit and look.
2.0,It‚Äôs horrible. I bought size M but they were just not good fit at all! I had to pay $9 to return it. It didn‚Äôt fit my son at all. I do not recognize at all
2.0,"These were bulky in design and in fit, so they were returned."
2.0,"This is misleading.  When they give you the measurements, those measurement equate to wearing the pants with nothing underneath, not to using the pants the way they are supposed to be used, as an over garment.<br /><br />Also, no option for additional sizing."
2.0,I cleaned them and the colors came off. I didn‚Äôt even clean them with alcohol. I cleaned them with soap and water and they basically became almost clear. Just a little bit of color remained. They are nice if you plan to never clean them.
2.0,"It's what I wanted but a little too small , had to get the next larger size. also it stains easily and the stain won't come out.... product should be treated with something to prevent this from happening..."
2.0,"neck opening way too large. body way too small. shirt made strangely. nice material, smooth and comfortable. just cut in a terrible, strange shape."
2.0,This is not meant for people with bigger hands. I wear a size 8 which is why I got an adjustable ring. There is between 1/2 & 1/4 inch gap between the ends on my ring finger on my smaller hand.
2.0,Very Cute would be better if had pockets
2.0,You get what you pay for...this seems to low quality fabric.  100% polyester ...after 3 washes it is looking warn out and does not flow nicely.  The fabric sticks together.  Why don't they make the prints in cotton?
2.0,Thick quality but once you put your foot in it gets all discombobulated. Nice idea... poor execution.
2.0,They don‚Äôt stay up. Waistband doesn‚Äôt hold up the pants. They fit fine elsewhere.
2.0,catches my hair and gets wrapped all around the chain
2.0,"Love this companies‚Äô ideals! Unfortunately The cut of the mask isn‚Äôt contoured enough to fit a face, it‚Äôs just basically a flat piece of cloth and falls off our kids faces (we‚Äôve never had that problem in any other kids masks before)."
2.0,"These are thin, super long, and way too big. I usually wear a 2-3X and bought these in a 3X. I probably would have been ok buying an XL easily."
2.0,The dress was quite wrinkled upon arrival. The material is scratchy and hot. Good luck tying a bow like the one seen in the picture.
2.0,The shorts I received were nothing like the picture. They were a really stretchy material and not so much of a denim and the color of the shorts are darker. Definitely not a happy customer.
2.0,"looked well made, but the size chart is way off. had to return it."
2.0,Size not as I expected and does not look as good as I thought. Returned.
2.0,These are very pretty. But I wore the heart ones one day and the stones fell out. I was so disappointed. And I also told Amazon and the sender but I never got a response. And no reimbursement.
2.0,Bad enough I found my package just thrown in the yard upside down but apparently this was broken in half and a tooth was chipped. Clearly needed to be packaged separately and with lots more cushion!
2.0,Advertised as a children‚Äôs neck gaiter. Received adult size. Return process easy but wish was advertised correctly.
2.0,"It was to small, brought it for my two year old and it was tight."
2.0,"Positives: the quality of the material, it definitely has Tummy control and is squat proof<br />Negatives: the waist is almost TOO high and the shorts run big, causing excess material to collect at the tummy area. And since the material is thick, it makes you look fat.<br />Conclusion: all in all the shorts are really nice quality, I‚Äôm going to return them and go a size down to a small, I hope this fixes the problem because I really want the shorts to work."
2.0,"I loved the material! The shirt fit. It was just too short for me. If this shirt was 3&#34; longer, I would probably wear it everyday. Had to return based on the length only."
2.0,"Fit was perfect for 5 and 8 year old.  They said it was breathable and perfect for sports use. Unfortunately, one gaiter unraveled after one week of owning and two washes. Returned and will update review if it seems to have been a defective batch."
2.0,Didn't like the fabric or the fact that it was from China. It was over priced
2.0,The bust was awkward and the padding was lumpy.
2.0,Acute watch and perfect size for my wrist but the battery was dead . Very dissapointed because now I have to take it to be replaced somewhere instead of enjoying it when I got it.
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt true to size
2.0,"We love this dress, but I bought a size 9-10 for my 8 year old after seeing that it ran small.  I'm not sure  it would fit a 5 year old, it's so small. I'm super disappointed, but grateful for free returns!!"
2.0,"The material is comfortable, but the sizing makes no sense. I had to order a large to fit my 37&#34; hips. (Plus, all of the previous reviews said the fit was too small and I usually wear between a small and a medium.) However, when the pants arrived they did fit my hips, but they were way too large on my waist. Even the small says it's made for a 27&#34; waist on the size chart, but I have a 25.5&#34; waist. I didn't know whether to order a size up or down to accommodate my waist or my hips, and I'm not sure there's a correct option. Maybe the small would have stretched enough to still fit my hips, but I unfortunately missed the timing window to return/exchange. I just don't understand the sizing chart, so make sure you give it a good look before ordering ANY of these sizes."
2.0,"I ordered this swimsuit following the sizes recommended by the seller.  The body of it fit fine, almost tight, but the chest area was WAY WAY to big.  I am a C - D cup.  I would of had to do major alterations for this suit to work.  Amazon returned it for free.  I ordered a different suit from this seller that fit much better."
2.0,"These are a fun novelty gift, but only wearable if you have small feet. They are supposed to be unisex, but I bought as a gift for a man and there is no way he could wear them. They might fit a woman's max size 8."
2.0,The buttons on the blouse were not aligned with the buttonholes.  Threads were hanging everywhere that I trimmed off.  A huge blob of thread appearing to be  a very large knot was sewn into the back yoke and was visible immediately on the outside of the shirt.  This shirt did not make it to a quality control person.  The colors were true to the photo I saw on line but I was very disappointed in the quality.
2.0,Extremely difficult to figure out and pinches skin and hair!
2.0,Way too big for a pendant. It was more like a medal. It was almost the size of my palm.
2.0,"Unless you have a ton of hair, this was way too big for me."
2.0,Already get rid of the dress the fabric got ugly after the first wash
2.0,This band is very pretty but it is not Large or xl!  I held it against my other small:regular bands and it was the same size.  I planned to wear it on my ankle when I run but since it‚Äôs regular sized it won‚Äôt work.  Quite disappointed
2.0,Sizing on these sets are ridiculously small. I am 5'10 and the XL was teeny on me.
2.0,Sadly it was not a good buy
2.0,"Giving this dress 1 star for two reasons.<br /><br /> 1. I was sent TWO dresses in the wrong color and I am SUPER disappointed about it. I ordered a medium and a large in the greenish color because I was not sure about size and they BOTH came in pink. (I ordered them for a wedding this weekend so even if they could have exchanged for the right color it wouldn‚Äôt get here in time).<br /><br />2. the material was thin and since the pink dress has a white/cream background it is just slightly see through. You‚Äôd probably have to wear a slip with it. But on the other hand you have to remember you‚Äôre paying $18 for a dress so... all things to consider here.<br /><br />Fit wise I would say the dress runs true to size. I am usually a small/med in tops and a med/large in bottoms. The large fit my bottom half really well and was a little big up top, where as the medium fit my top half perfectly and was a little snug in the thighs/hips. Length wise I felt like it was not too short at all, i am 5‚Äô2‚Äù and both sizes fell past my finger tips.<br /><br />WOULD HAVE BEEN 5 STARS HAD THEY SENT THE CORRECT COLOR üò≠üò≠"
2.0,"I‚Äôm a medium everywhere but my bust (they‚Äôre large) since I‚Äôm a breastfeeding mama, I should‚Äôve just stayed to my true size. I put it through the wash and the bottom stitches started to fray."
2.0,"Gold is gone in no time. Sorry, I kept it out of water. Love the concept tho."
2.0,Bought 2 of these both size small. 1 for perfect the other was way too big!
2.0,Item was too small .
2.0,This coat is cut very small. I bought an XXL because I wear and XL and it still fits like a large üò¢. Giving it to my daughter to wear with her hoodies I guess....ugh.
2.0,"Meh. Good idea, bad execution. The print isn't that good. The socks were way tight. Once I put them on, the pattern was completely unnoticeable."
2.0,Runs quite small and it is very SHORT in length.  Especially for having a peplum....this should be longer.  This looks like a petite (short) size.  And additionally it looks more like a small than a medium.<br />The blouse itself is attractive and the fabric is nice to the touch.
2.0,I guess I got what I paid for.  These earrings are very thin and pointy.  They can be painful to wear.  The backing fell off very quickly and it was very difficult to replace because the posts were so thin.
2.0,"Ok wallet, but has left a sticky adhesive residue in my credit cards."
2.0,"These are absolutely beautiful shoes!  But the bow on the front is a string and within one day of wearing them the string came loose. After repeatedly tying them, they continue to come loose."
2.0,I ordered a 1x as I like my sweats loose and it's like a Medium. I normally wear an XXL and after reading reviews ordered 1x. Their okay. Not as thick as regular sweatpants . Good if you lounge in them maybe.
2.0,"Normally I take a size XL.  This shirt is listed as a size XXL.  It fits me as if it was barely a size L.  Other than the VERY inaccurate size designations, the shirt seems to be of reasonably decent material and build quality for its relatively modest price."
2.0,The patterns are cute.<br />But the quality of the material and stitching looks and feels cheap. Not sure how long they will last.<br /><br />But the quantity for price is good. However I prefer quality over quantity.
2.0,"This dress fit my dog.  It did not, however, fit me."
2.0,"I liked the color and sparkle. But it came with a hole in the front, and it is also see-through around tight places. It just didn‚Äôt fit well and came with a few holes and several snags. Really unfortunate because this dress looked great online."
2.0,"I really liked it but was too big and heavy to wear. My sister tried it and even though we could bend the top hook to fit, it was still too heavy and uncomfortable for her to wear."
2.0,"I'm disappointed to have to give this product a 2 start review, I was really looking forward to these bras. As I mommy of two babies under 2, I have been wearing nothing but this style of bras for the past 2 years. I really loved the colors available and I was looking forward to changing up my bra collection lol. When they came in they looked beautiful, the colors just as expected. At first they were super comfortable and they had great support. However, after a few hours my nipple pads started to slide and move out of place, and by the end of the day my boobs were slipping out of the bra. I thought maybe it was me or something but then after trying 3 different bras from this purchase and the same thing keeps happening I am sure it is the bras. Today I kept the bra for longer, so put it on yesterday morning and kept it all day and night and it's now half way through the second day (let's face it a new mom doesn't always have time to shower and change every day), and I lost my nipple pad, at some point during the day it completely slipped out of the bra. Anyway I'm super disappointed and will not purchase any more bras here."
2.0,It‚Äôs made of polyester and doesn‚Äôt fit right in the arms
2.0,This is a very thin material so please be cautious is wanting to wear this with anything other than jeans. It is really too long for jeans though as it fits more like a dress.
2.0,"Lasted only 6 months. The latch was also too loose and keys would sometimes slip off when pressed against my waist. In addition, the latch would get caught on fabric. I only ever did it on my pant loop, and today it just snapped off. Going back to a trigger snap fob."
2.0,I bought these after reading all the good reviews. I was disappointed in them since one of the earmuffs keeps falling off the headband. My son has only wore these one time for Monster Jam. I will have to buy a different one for the 4th of July. It was a waste of money.
2.0,I will not buy this item again. they fit as expected but there is no life in the material or the stitching.
2.0,runs SUPER Small!
2.0,"Not suggested, does not fit my woman as described"
2.0,"It is my size, the top fits great, but the fabric has no stretch or room to move so the bottom is extremely tight . Don't want to waste time sending it back, so I'll give it away. My lost"
2.0,"Top fits fine, but bottoms are too small. The bottoms barely cover his bottom, as they continue to slide down on the back end. He currently wears a 6T."
2.0,I got this shirt  in a size large but I swear it's more like a size small. It looks great and I got it to give my sister for Christmas who by the way wears a medium and I am afraid it's too small.. To late to send it back and I will need to go to a store and spend more money.
2.0,I‚Äôve had several watches in my lifetime.<br />I can easily read and understand instructions .<br />I can easily see and understand YouTube videos trying to tell how to set the time etc.<br />Nope ‚Ä¶ GOOD LUCK .<br />Once you get it set ‚Ä¶ do not touch it ‚Ä¶ which means you can‚Äôt use any other functions.<br />Even the YouTube videos can‚Äôt get it right ‚Ä¶ if your‚Äôe lucky enough to find an ‚Äúexact‚Äù video for this watch.<br />Sorry G Shock ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so impossibly difficult to operate ‚Ä¶ the instructions are too vague and the entire world is making YouTube videos trying to explain the operating instructions for this particular watch.<br />Find something else.
2.0,Loved this but very small.
2.0,"Fit is cute and comfortable but after a few minutes of wear, the cups are no longer covering my breasts. I got a large and I'm 34D."
2.0,SO SOFT! Looks great! Ordered larger than normal and worked out great for a person with small hips. perfect length for them at height of around 5'4. Only problem so far....lint everywhere!!! Washed and dried it to see if that would help....it did not! Leaving a lint trail everywhere you go in the robe is quite frustrating!
2.0,Nice bag but handles broke after two weeks.<br />I use this as a Gym bag so i take good care of it. But handles broke after two weeks - sad !
2.0,"Bought for Christmas, by January several of these charms were already broken"
2.0,"I am so frustrated! The Rekucci brand's sizing is way off! I wear a size 10 and the first pair of bermudas I ordered were a size 10. When I got them, I could hardly get one leg in them. Seriously! They were more like a 4. Then I tried a size 12, which were also too tight. Finally I ordered a size 14, thinking they would be a little loose. No, they were skin tight. This is ridiculous. You need to stop selling this brand. They actually look great, but the sizes are way off."
2.0,"Doesn‚Äôt fit like in the picture. Ordered my usual size and yes they were too big in waist but were huge in the thighs and leg. No stretch to them either, so they won‚Äôt ever fit perfectly unless loose is what you‚Äôre looking for. On top of it I have to pay to return, not happy about that at all"
2.0,This item was called Sweat Bands. These are purely for fashion. They are made of thin flimsy non-absorbant material. Gave them to my niece.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:a1e0f641e53bbd4ce1f4a6dec47132fd]] I am typically a medium in everything but in this case I would have gotten a large. Since the first time I put it on the bum stitches popped. Luck it was an easy fix, and looked great. It is a bit see through and you will get cold if it‚Äôs a chilly day. Also you won‚Äôt be able to type on your phone with the gloves."
2.0,I didn't like it.  It would not maintain its shape and not loose enough to be floppy.
2.0,Not comfortable even though it fits.
2.0,Meh quality. Definitely overstate the original price to make it seem like a good deal.
2.0,Beautiful fabric but too bulky
2.0,I feel that it looks a lot cheaper in person than online and it also looks a little childish.
2.0,Super thin. And they are all very light in color. The black is more like a clear grey. Not very with them. Look nothing like the pictures
2.0,Arrived on Sunday. Broken by Friday. Wore 3 times over the span of 6 hours. Elastic band weak.
2.0,"very pretty, but more child-sized than adult."
2.0,I had reservations about ordering this necklace but did anyways because I thought maybe I could put the pendant on another chain if I didn‚Äôt like the clear line it was on. Well when the necklace arrived I was very disappointed with the quality and wouldn‚Äôt be able to put the pendant on another chain anyway.
2.0,Runs on the small size and very very light .Nothing to keep you warm<br />Disappointed
2.0,"too small for husband wrist and dragon can get uncomfortable gave away to kid, its cheap but it looks cool."
2.0,Very baggy and the zipper is cheap and doesn't zip properly.  Will be sending this back
2.0,"I love the look of this belt, but it only has one prong that fits into the holes so it often comes undone."
2.0,Unfortunately they didn't fit the way I was hoping. Too much space between lens and my face.
2.0,I‚Äôd return it if I didn‚Äôt wash it hoping it would soften up.
2.0,The bag is beautiful and the details are what made me purchase it however the gold fasteners that hold the inside pockets in place have already become unattached and lost after the first wear ... not happy about that at all!!
2.0,"2 things wrong with this product.<br />I'm 5'3"" and these pants were a few inches too long.<br />There's no lining."
2.0,"It does not feel to be great quality. I was expecting it to be almost one piece of leather, but it barely has enough to give the strap any structure.  One good thing about it: its soft. But, after only a week or two, the side of the strap started to come apart. I did get a replacement from the seller (great seller), but I have yet to test the new one out."
2.0,This dress is very cute and the cut is flattering however the material is so incredibly cheap I will be shocked if it makes it through the wash. I wouldn't dare put it in the dryer.
2.0,üëéüèæ Too small
2.0,Looked great until I washed it once on all the settings they recommended and it still scraped all the paint off and now its unwearable
2.0,"These were cute but they didn't stay up at all. Every time I moved my leg or walked somewhere they would slide down. Way too big around the thigh. I ordered the small and yes, they have grips on the top but they don't help them stay up. I returned."
2.0,"i didn't receive what I expected. only the shape was the same; different color for the larger ball, and different painting on them. Both were worse than the picture. I felt like I was scammed."
2.0,"The jacket skulls were upside down, unlike the picture..."
2.0,"These block noise kinda ok, but they are super uncomfortable. A lot of pressure put on your temples and they suction to your ears. Not the kind of thing for an autistic kiddo. We just got to the point where he will tolerate headphones in general at school and went to transfer that skill to home...unfortunately we lost the return window so I‚Äôm stuck with them. My suggestion is that if you buy these, that you try them on before the return window closes."
2.0,Color not as pictured. It‚Äôs a way lighter purple. Looks faded.
2.0,Was quickly delivered but turned green and my ear got infected.  I thought it was surgical steel.
2.0,"I have a smaller head, and this hat was still very tight. The pom pom is now sewn on very well and seems like it would rip of pretty easily."
2.0,I didn't realize how short they are. Too much trouble to return them.
2.0,material too thin
2.0,The item came way too small.
2.0,Bummed. I am 4‚Äô11‚Äù & about 140lbs (hips & butt!) so i got a xl/xxl and i cant get it over my thighs :( my 14 yr old that is tiny (wears1-3 in jrs) it fit her....
2.0,Definitely run small and mine had a hole in them when they came in.
2.0,"Ordered an xl in hopes of it being somewhat baggy, fits more like a medium."
2.0,"Toe hold did not last on left, came out, may try to super glue or try shoe goop.."
2.0,"Looks fairly cheap.  Not sure, I will wear it.  The crystal drops are plastic."
2.0,"I love the size and look of this bag, but the hardware hooking the strap on came apart right away.  I also have had the zipper tab come off.  Disappointing."
2.0,The colors are not what they look like in pictures so it‚Äôs not sold as it‚Äôs advertised at all will not order from seller again
2.0,I have a Seiko self winding watch and the &#34;automatic watch winder&#34; doesn't keep up with the mechanism when left for over 8 hours.
2.0,It is too small not what I expected it is far different from the one shown in the photo. I am very unhappy with this purchase üò•üòñ
2.0,Much smaller than real bdu
2.0,the top part of this dress is way too wide to be even difficult to even wear a bralette  without it showing as well if your big chested this dress might be good for you.  too much slack in the top
2.0,"This top did not fit as well as the original top.  Where it shows that top is loose, it isn't,  It is just made different."
2.0,Too big!! Way bigger than pictured. I thought they were stud type earrings but they hang like drop earrings they are so big. I returned this item.
2.0,This seemed like a nice solid leather belt that would last many years but sadly the poor quality buckle only lasted 6 months. I wish I had noticed the similar images of broken buckles before I ordered.
2.0,The color of the bow tie does not match the suspenders. The bowtie is a very bright pink which we wanted. The suspenders are a darker pink. We ended up using the bowtie but the suspenders are still in the package.
2.0,"Smaller than expected. Bad material, clingy."
2.0,Had very little stretch fairly fit my kids arms
2.0,"I realize this ring was very inexpensive, however it honestly looks like a toy ring. I love sterling silver because of how bright and shiny it is, but this ring just looks cheap. I dislike leaving less than positive reviews, but in this case I felt I need to. The dragonfly appears to be delicately mounted so I worry the tail may catch on something and rip right off. Still, I suppose it is good for the price paid.<br /><br />Shipping was exceptionally fast and it arrived nicely packaged"
2.0,Not impressed with quality
2.0,Balls fall off easily.
2.0,Cut way more narrow than described. Also the fabric is not the best quality in the world. It kinda feels like Halloween costume material.
2.0,It was not the quality I was looking for. The fleece lining was thin. I was embarrassed to give it to my grandson. Worth half the price.
2.0,Size is WAY off
2.0,Design was nice but the fit is awful. It's just way too big. I got the small and it was like I'd ordered a large. If you are a small person it's just not going to fit/hang right.
2.0,Bought for my mom. Did not fit and were very uncomfortable.
2.0,The sizing is so weird and way too small
2.0,Ordered this for my daughter. She is 8. It came with a filter. It‚Äôs too small for her. The loops were bending her ears basically. I‚Äôd say these masks are for kids younger maybe 7 years old and younger
2.0,strings beak and beads fall off
2.0,Very cute but not at all flattering when worn. There just isn‚Äôt much shape to it.
2.0,"It's rather see through and the fabric isn't soft at all, unfortunately."
2.0,"This band is really comfortable and I wanted to love it. However, it did not stay tight as I have small wrists and it broke AFTER ONLY A MONTH!"
2.0,wears more like a robe and didn't come close to fully covering the chest.  It is cute but unwearable.
2.0,"It must be a delicate balance : the tummy control vs. the comfort.<br />this is not really a complaint, but I had a stomach ache in just a 3-4 hrs."
2.0,Not for me-they look scratched rather than hammered. I'll be returning them.
2.0,"The outfit was really cute when it arrived. The colors were nice and vibrant. The shirt was a little large in the chest and shoulders (collar sagging open and falling off the shoulders). I have a petite 5 1/2 year old, but she wears 5T just fine in other clothing. We washed it and she wore it for one day at school. There was a hole in the crotch of the pants with just one wear, and the pants looked incredibly faded with just one wash. They looked like they had been worn lots of times, as opposed to once. Would not recommend the whole outfit. The shirt was super cute, but again, not a good fit. If the shirt were sold alone, I would size down one size, but the pants are crap."
2.0,The material is not what I expected.Its wrinkly and needs to be ironed to get the wrinkles out.I don‚Äôt care to iron.I wish it was a different material.The quality is poor but the print is beautiful.It fits okay.
2.0,They are pretty but the plastic broke in a week.
2.0,Its clingy and fits more like something I would wear under a dress. I gave it away.
2.0,"I purchased this bracelet for a friend. The bracelet was too small and hard to open. Once I got the bracelet open, the beads flew everywhere. The safety chain doesn‚Äôt screw on, it‚Äôs very loose and slides on the bracelet like the rest of the charms. It‚Äôs not worth the hassle of returning so my friend will probably give it to one of her children. This bracelet looks just like what is pictured and is beautiful. Very disappointing!"
2.0,I loved the style and fabric. But the shirt did not fit at all. This was definitely not a US XXL. The sleeves were about 3&#34; too short. I kept it to give to my daughter who wears a medium.
2.0,This necklace is actually very cheap-looking in person.  It's too bad bc I've ordered several other necklaces from this brand that I love.  This one just looks cheap and isn't flattering.  :(
2.0,The post broke on these within a few days sadly.
2.0,Not warm enough
2.0,I ordered a small and it was too tight and not relaxed as I expected it to be. Fits more like a tight crop top. I am 5 feet and 34D.
2.0,I don't  like the ring.  This in second day broken????
2.0,"It's very pretty, but the fastening loop doesn't fit over the brass bead, so I can't wear it. I like the beads well enough to use them in a different bracelet, but this is hardly what I expected."
2.0,"Very pretty,, but earring arrived broken"
2.0,The top doesn't fit well. Poorly made without support and not symmetrical on each side.  Which is too bad as it looks cute in the picture.  I wear a 34C and size 4
2.0,"This cardigan runs quite small. The chart says that a XL is the equivalent of a US XL but I think is more like a M or L. The color that I received is definitely not the same as the one pictured. I'm not saying is ugly but it's not what I saw and liked. The fabric feels real soft and is thin like a T-shirt. Idk why, but I expected something a bit thicker. The quality is good."
2.0,"This thing is LOUD!!!!!!!! The top of the winder is cheap plexiglass ,and will scratch the first time you clean the dust from it. Save your money and buy another brand.  100.00 on World of Watches TV so, 199.99 is a no go."
2.0,"The shirt is cute. The material is very thick and stretchy, I thought it was going tobe a thinner looser material from the picture. I'm a little disappointed. First of all, it took over a month to get in!"
2.0,"Style is nice,but it looks cheap fabric"
2.0,"These gloves were supposed to be Burgundy (see image and my package label), but were instead red. REALLY REALLY RED.<br />They looked clownish."
2.0,"Feels like a decent quality fake leather, but it doesn't open fully. Poor design."
2.0,Not as long as it appears in picture n fit small.
2.0,I ordered 5 of this item and all of them looked different. Some ears didn't have the white triangles and the tails were all very short.
2.0,Product does adhere to skin adequately
2.0,They are great but there fit are too big
2.0,The bag was humungus.  There was no way of pulling it off as a purse I ended up giving it to my sister for a stylish diaper bag.
2.0,"I bought three colors of this belt in 2017 to replace a belt that I needed to replace due to just getting sweat stained and dirty from summer heat in Arizona.  Upon inspection of the tan belt I noticed that it was a gold tone on the vinyl parts compared to the pictures and previous belt.  The vinyl material was a bit thinner than the other colors.<br /><br />After 2 1/2 years the belt has failed as a result of poor workmanship - it ripped on the line of the stitching - one of the stitches was to close to the end of the material and created a weak point that did fail.<br /><br />If you purchase this belt, I would suggest a critical inspection upon arrival, because I don't believe the inspector in China is present."
2.0,The words were misspelled/cut off.  Company gave me full refund.
2.0,Washed it once and it broke the strap
2.0,"Color  is way to off to gold,so upset really looked nice"
2.0,returned the top was way to big.  bottom was ok.  Material was thin.
2.0,Very nice looking shades but the nose piece fell off before I even wore them..
2.0,"The straps to hold the clips for each leg we‚Äôre defective. The Velcro strips were on opposite sides of the strap so you had to flip one side to make the connection. It was disappointing because it held, but was uncomfortable. I couldn‚Äôt wear them out and had to return them."
2.0,Disappointed. The headpiece came today. My daughter ordered to wear to her school dance. The headband came broken. The emblishment that hangs off the headband was broken off and one of the Rhinestones fell off when we picked it out of the package. In addition the ribbons were not attached and one is frayed at the end. It is a very pretty piece but disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"Bought these for my daughter who started med school about 6 months ago. They worked well...for a while. Then she noticed that the time was wrong. Finally discovered that the second hand was &#34;stuck&#34; in some fashion, so she switched one watch out for one of the remaining 2. Each of these now has the same problem. Something happens wherein the second hand gets stuck and then, of course, the time is wrong. She needed these mainly for timing pulses and taking blood pressure, so the actual time was less important than the second hand working. Obviously a design flaw, given that it happened to all three over time. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars."
2.0,Runs very small.  Material is very thin.
2.0,Had it for a month and it broke completely. Was nice at first and just as the picture.
2.0,"I have to 2 stars because these pajamas have potential.  But they to small my son is a 3T.  I bought the 4T and the top was to small. After you wash them twice they would be to small.  I understand that pajamas for toddlers are tight, these are sized small"
2.0,I mean it was 6$ but it's very small even though I ordered two sizes up. The top cuts in very narrowly which means you are spilling out both sides. Don't buy this unless you are a small person with small boobs.
2.0,It's a beautiful ring but didn't even have it on one day and it turned my finger green.
2.0,"I bought this ring a few months back, and when I FINALLY got it(it came late, even after paying a pretty penny for expedited shipping, and they absolutely would NOT get back to me)I fell in love with it.  The stone is beautiful.  But after wearing it for only a couple hours, it had turned my finger dark green.  I was really surprised and disappointed, so I took it off and put it into an old ring box I had.  Now, I'm really annoyed because after only wearing it a good 5 times(and for a very short amount of time), the edges have turned black! The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I really loved the stone.  Very disappointed in the quality of the ring, and will not be buying from Silver Insanity again."
2.0,It's very nice .. just the yellow gold is way too yellow .. and the band is a little uncomfortable because of the way it locks .. but other then that it's very nice ..
2.0,"Got an xxl (I am a 14) and gave it to a friend who is an 8/10, it fits her just right. But it is very cute on her."
2.0,"Sent it back, too heavy...must be because of all the hardware on it!"
2.0,Small tote. Definitely not for grown adults. The pictures don't look like the real thing. The color is bright but the quality looks cheap.
2.0,It's so dark and brown :(
2.0,"When I received it, the2 parts are dismantled.  I had to put them together and make use of it.  This product is very poor quality."
2.0,"this bracelet is NOT rubber.  It is faux leather (P.U.) and the black coloring is peeling off of it after 1 month.  if it was really made of rubber, this would not happen.  The closure is also easily opened and I have watched this bracelet fly off my wrist several times"
2.0,"This hat is cute, but very very small and very thin.  Maybe ok for a little girl, but not an adult.  I won't be wearing it, but kept it for my granddaughter.  Be advised, this hat will not keep you warm in a cold winter.  Two stars because it's cute."
2.0,These were a gift & I was disappointed with the quality
2.0,it doesn't looks like the picture.
2.0,"Same as the other one, TOO thing for my liking & on the small side"
2.0,Cheap fabric and not flattering.
2.0,Not what I expected. Tarnished after wearing for 3 hours.
2.0,"This beanie was not 12 inches wide as advertised. It is the standard 9 inches........way too small, squeezes my head like 99 percent of beanies out there. It is made partially of soft cotton so would make a nice beanie for a small child. If you don't like The squeeze, search online for a big and tall beanie."
2.0,"Fits as it should in terms of size. But high impact it is not. Very thin, no real support at all. I kept them only because the front comes up higher than my older sports bras, so I‚Äôm not flashing anyone during yoga. But if you‚Äôre looking for something to stand up to Zumba or something like boot camp...I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this, unless you‚Äôre not big. It may do just fine then. But for bigger girls, not really"
2.0,Thin and flimsy. Can see underwear showing through. These are more like tights for under a dress or long shirt and shouldn't be worn as pants alone.
2.0,"The personalized design is great but the case is not hard shell, its soft and offers no real protection other than from scratches."
2.0,"Product was delivered fast. Nothing wrong with it besides it having an awful shrimp smell. Drenched it with febreeze, stuck it in a bag with a dryer sheet and let it sit for a few days."
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute, but not the dress I ordered. The one I received was sleeveless."
2.0,hardly fit over breast
2.0,"I am giving it two stars because the color is pretty. Size runs small. And the ruffles were horrible. It‚Äôs a nice dress but it wasn‚Äôt for me. If you‚Äôre ordering , order one size up because it runs extremely small and it is not stretch."
2.0,Did not like the fact that they kept sliding down.<br />I previously purchased one where both ends of the mask would expend and return back to there normal state to ensure non slipping while maintaining comfort ability.
2.0,The dress is fine but it didn‚Äôt come with the sash. So now I have to go find one.
2.0,"The poles are well made, versatile and durable.  However, the manufacturers have not responded to my inquiries about getting replacement snow baskets.  The feet attachments are going to be lost all the time, it happens.  The company should either provide replacements or give a recommendation/guidelines of what other company to get replacements from that will fit.  I'm disappointed that ""Breakfast on Everest"" not only doesn't seem to sell these even on their website, but that they couldn't even be bothered to respond to me when I reached out to them."
2.0,"I just don't get all the reviews...<br /><br />Maybe it is old - I  had it for 6 months plus, before opening the package. It is just two cloths ...no significant before and after polishing and buffing.<br /><br />Perhaps use it immediately?  Certainly Silver polish is so much better."
2.0,"I have ordered 7 different yoga leggings and these are by far the lowest rise of all of them. Additionally, the string from the crotch to the backside started unraveling after 1 wash (cold wash hung to dry). The fabric is not a soft but probably the best summer, it's a little bit thinner and has good wicking properties."
2.0,Didn‚Äôt fit mouth properly but it served it purpose for Halloween.
2.0,The band is separating on the ends.
2.0,Terrible quality not well-made at all! They have a nice look when you see them on the screen but in person they are cheap looking not very stretchy the clips are very flimsy that hold the belt together oh no not a good purchase.
2.0,The waist sinch is too high. It would be better if the was no elastic.
2.0,The zipper was cheap and the bag didn't open very wide so i ended up scratching my arm a few times (not anything painful just annoying) trying to put something in it. The material seemed to be coming apart from something because it seemed to be &#34;bubbling&#34;. Not a fan. Sent it back.
2.0,The silver color is already wearing off the back of the ring after only 2 months
2.0,"I was so excited when this arrived because I really wanted to like this shirt. The fabric was a comfortable weight and the fit of the XL was almost perfect for me with good length in the body and sleeves (I'm 170lbs, 5'10&#34;, 36G). The chest was barely, and I mean the tiniest bit too snug for my taste, but with no gaps whatsoever in the buttons (I was impressed as this is usually a problem for me). I could have overlooked that if not for a few things... One: it didn't drape at all like in the product image. It stuck out in the front and it looked like I was wearing a maternity shirt. Two: the little accent pieces of patterned fabric.were potentially(?) the same pattern as seen in the product image, but were way bolder in color in person, and made of a shinier fabric. Which to me just looked strange next to the more muted shade of green on the sleeves. And three: the accent pieces were not stitched down on the edges where they meet the white/ivory fabric. This was present on both the front and the back, so whenever you move the fabric just tents out all over the place. I've attached some photos to show what I mean. I could say this was maybe a fluke manufacturing issue, but the color issue is enough to make this a return and not an exchange."
2.0,The zipper broke about a week after I received it.<br />Otherwise it is a nice backpack.
2.0,came in without any case. not as per description.
2.0,"Even though the measurements said 39""-44"" it was on the small size, not enough to make it completely useless, but they were not accurate measurements and my child is not big in any sense of the word."
2.0,These glasses are high on the bridge of my nose. I was hoping to adjust the nose piece but there is no way to change the fit.
2.0,I bought this for my 4-5 year old and the size was way to small. The stitching was also lacking. Lots of  strays. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these.
2.0,It runs one size bigger for me.  The listed material are 90% spandex and 10% nylon; but I would be really surprised it it contains more than 5% spandex.  It claims that it won't roll up; but the waist band rolls down!<br /><br />Not recommended.
2.0,"This shirt was well made & had very comfortable material. However, it was extremely small. I always wear a 2X with no problems & this shirt was ridiculously way too small."
2.0,"Love the look of it, but It broke after onlly ten minutes of wearing it! The pin holding the cross to the bail fell out!"
2.0,Nice but poor quality ‚òπÔ∏è and packing was not safe for that kind of merchandise
2.0,"Runs a little small, but still fit."
2.0,"I ordered a bunch of red accessories for my new vehicle and I was most excited for this keychain. $10 for a keychain, pretty steep price - you would think it would be great quality. But unfortunately I was disappointed right after opening this.<br /><br />1) Mind you, I have big hands-- but the leather hoop is tiny, I can barely fit my finger through it. So the giant clip/ring feels unnecessary.<br /><br />2) This doesn't feel like leather, it feels like plastic. It is so stiff, it feels like it will snap if it bends any. It's like when you go to the back of your pantry and you get very excited because you find a Fruit Rollup and then you're like &#34;Awww man, this is 10 years old - it's as hard as a rock!&#34;<br /><br />What a bummer. I guarentee this won't last more than a couple months.<br /><br />But the good part, it still looks decent. The leather looks like leather but feels like plastic. Knowing this, I wouldn't have paid over $3 for it."
2.0,"They smell! I even unwrapped them and hung them outside for a couple days and they still smell. They do look like I expected and look fine, I just can't wear them yet."
2.0,One size fits all but I have a large head and this beanie is still huge!
2.0,"I got the smallest size, which is medium , and it fit my 5‚Äô5‚Äù 130lb frame like a tent. Not flattering."
2.0,Item was wayy to small not as depicted
2.0,Very nice quality.  The stiching on arm connected on back was off. The shoulders puckered.  Runs small.  If you have large arms the sleeve will be to tight.  Sorry  to have  to return it.
2.0,"I ordered these in size 2xl, because I'm a size 18 and that's what usually works for these stretchy pants. There was barely any stretch in the waist of the pants, and they looked to be maybe size 10-12. I ordered the 'coffee' color, which looked to be a nice dark brown, but they were a lighter and -for lack of a better word- ugly brown color. The material was low-end legging material, so expect that quality of fabric. The band of fabric at the waist was also a lot less wide than shown in the photo."
2.0,I loved this ring but after only a few times wearing it it snapped in half.
2.0,"These were cute earrings for 7 year old girl, however, they were kind of large.  They were made of flimsy material.  I do not feel they would last long."
2.0,Just got delivered today.. really like them but had a tear on the left leg :(
2.0,"The material is nice and feels good on the legs. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6, 160 and wear an 8/10 easy. I got the Large as the chart recommended. However, since I‚Äôm not built like the model, the waist band rolls down and is not flattering at all in the crotch area. I will not buy another pair of these."
2.0,"Sadly, I cannot use this clasp. Please read on to decide if this applies to you also. There is good news even though I can't use it - the quality is quite good and is an excellent value at this price. I liked it's design because it tucks the strap tang *UNDER* the clasp when closed. (there's no exposed leather end) In my opinion this is much better than other designs because of this feature.<br /><br />Explanation:<br /><br />My leather watch band's tang [the part with the holes] is 2.5mm thick. The pin in this clasp 2mm tall. The space for the strap is 3.8mm high. That all means this clasp can slip off my band even when closed and latched - which it did a couple times while testing.<br /><br />If your band's tang is thicker - your results might be acceptable. I don't understand why the height of the pin doesn't equal the space. (3.8mm) Had it been made this way - no band that physically fit could slip out, and I could have used it.<br /><br />Other things to know - This clasp's length is relatively short and adds 56mm to the band when open.  My wrist is 210mm, and my hand will not collapse to less than 290mm. My watch and band with this clasp won't go over my hand when it's set to the shorter lengths. I may have been able to compromise and use it anyway, but it would be a close call. So be aware that if your hand is also large, you too may need a longer clasp, or another type.<br /><br />Folks with smaller hand-to-wrist measurement differences should be ok."
2.0,"It looked cute but the material was thin, and it was too loose. Returned."
2.0,takes several washes to remove the &#34;new&#34; smell.
2.0,Beautiful but too small purposely ordered larger to have altered but the large size is too small I'll need to wear something under it. #disappointed
2.0,I like the fabric and the dress fit me - except for the neck which is too tight.  Disappointing.
2.0,"It only has one side which is downer in my book, quality is not as good as pictured. Wouldn't reorder."
2.0,Ok item. You get what you pay.
2.0,"It‚Äôs pretty but was supposed to be cotton, so I was excited about that! I hate polyester!! There‚Äôs no content tag, but I know polyester when I feel it. Also very wrinkled after washing so must be cheap polyester haha"
2.0,"From the short time using this product, the leather is pealing from all sides of the case.<br />The case is still strongly keeping the phone within it. The case look as if is a year old."
2.0,Funny mask and with great definition but proportions are off. When wearing the mouth and nose don‚Äôt match up to my face and are about 3x too big.
2.0,No what I expected!
2.0,Terrible quality. The seams started opening up after one wash.
2.0,Smelled super bad like chemicals and didn‚Äôt want to stay on my face. Barely used them.
2.0,"I reeeeeeally wanted to love this shirt. It's light weight. Makes me chuckle that a ""sweatshirt"" (not actually a sweatshirt, just heavier, stretchy material) says ""I'm Cold"". But it's so short it's almost a crop top. I'm a short lady and this was comically short on me. Which again, is awful because it was perfect otherwise. So if shorter long sleeve tops are your thing, go for it. Also, an XL fit me perfectly and I'm a solid medium in everything I wear."
2.0,My heal slides.
2.0,Way to small buy two sizes up can‚Äôt return to late :(
2.0,"I really enjoy this bag , however it doesn‚Äôt hold a iPad , maybe a iPad mini. Not a lot room dimensions are alittle off , I wish it was bigger"
2.0,"I didn't like the material of this dress. It was thick and (in my opinion) not ideal for an elegant outing.<br />Also, it fit me oddly. It did not flatter my 36-26-38 frame. I give the measurements in case that helps anyone. I ordered a size small."
2.0,"the skirt is not orange, it's more of a burnt orange. It's less orange than the picture.  It also runs very small.  Returning because I would not wear anything on the bottom before wearing burnt orange."
2.0,"They are cheaply made spandex tanks. The stitching and seems look cheap. If you just need something to workout in they will probably hold up long enough to warrant the price, but they aren't good quality. I was looking for true compression tops like the product says they are, but there's no real compression of any kind. I'll be returning and looking elsewhere."
2.0,"These gym tanks fit very nicely upon the first time or two you wear them. After they're washed, countless snags appear on the mesh apparel making them look raggity. I cannot recommend these."
2.0,This product worth not more than 12$ for its quality. Its priced doubled and not that much great product.
2.0,Wasn‚Äôt crazy about the  material when opening. But didn‚Äôt hate it. As I tried it on it had a rip down the side
2.0,"Looks pretty, stitching is low quality. Worn once,seem already coming undone."
2.0,You get what you pay for. The flower on the pin was badly bent. It fell off the pin completely within minutes of trying on the dress. There was also a defect in the hem as there was an additional loop of hem attached to the bottom of the skirt.
2.0,"The product description says it's polarized but they are not, actualy the lensses are very cloudy, I wash them once and again and again and I was never able to see clear with them, worst than crapy $5 glasses!"
2.0,Thought it was teal :/
2.0,"this was for a cosplay costume so I didn't wear it long, it was pretty tight and I have a 26&#34; waist"
2.0,"I ordered these shades from the Knockaround website. They dug into my skull right behind the ears and became unwearable after about an hour. They have very thick frames and are probably hard to break, but they have no flex and are therefore uncomfortable. If I was fat and had padding on my head, maybe they would be wearable. But I am not fat and would not recommend these for anyone wanting comfortable shades to wear for prolonged periods of time."
2.0,"Disappointed again that a sock advertised as being flexible will not fit me,"
2.0,"Nice pendant, however the chain is very short. I would suggest buying this for a responsible child. Not for adults"
2.0,Not the best quality! Some what flimsy.
2.0,not figure flattering; fabric too thin;
2.0,I really enjoyed these but within a week the plastic on the nose pad fell off and I couldn‚Äôt find it.
2.0,Nice print but only two layers. I bought because it said cotton but it's polyester material
2.0,"Love the style, only issue is the Michael Kors branding on the side has rubbed off."
2.0,Color is gorgeous but the material covering the breast area is super small. I'm a size D and have a broad back. No go for me.
2.0,"This top looks as if someone just decided to cut in half. The cut wasn't straight and there's no stitching where it was cut so of course, it started to rip and come undone. Really disappointed that I only got to wear it once."
2.0,"not a good fit, place for filters and none included"
2.0,very large...gave it away
2.0,I was a little disappointed to find that the beads came out of order/got tangled up after very little use. I had bought 2 packages for my daughters to give out to their friends as friendship bracelets. I had at at least 4 out of the 20 with beads out of order/tangled up like in the picture. Could not figure out how to put them in place again. Besides that I think they are cute but not study for kids.
2.0,"Them are very pretty and nice quality...but I will not be able to wear them.  They are heavy and lever back, not post like I thought, so they pull on the lobes and make the ears look stretched.  So disappointed."
2.0,"It's COMPLETELY a different color than what was advertised. Not red at all, its more of a blush pink. Disappointed for this reason."
2.0,"I am really disappointed with this. I loved the clasp and the cord was the perfect thickness and length, but the leather has an unbelievably strong and unpleasant musty aroma. I tried airing it out but it's still awful. Can't recommend this.<br />Update: After posting this review, the seller contacted me to apologize and offered me a refund. So while I still can't recommend this item, the seller was very responsive and helpful."
2.0,This dress is gorgeous and would have received a 5 star if the size chart was even close to being correct. My daughter is 45 lbs wears a size 6 ... Now keep in mind I have ordered off of Amazon before and used the size chart and everything fit just fine. This dress fell off of her. I had to take it in a total of 4&#34; on to keep it from sliding down and that still was not enough. This dress is most likely actually a size 10. Order a size smaller !
2.0,I like the size and shape of the earrings.<br />I don't like the metal.  It isn't shiny enough
2.0,Runs small.  Poor quality.  More like lounge wear.
2.0,Item was listed as khaki color but looked more so peach. One of the buttons on the sleeve was not attached just loose in the bag. Sleeves are some what tight. I am 5'9 168Ibs with a 34b bust. I ordered a large according to their size chart it fits perfect everywhere besides the arms.
2.0,nice for a little girl jewelry.my little girl love them
2.0,After 1 or 2 uses these socks slide off the feet. Other than that these are cute.
2.0,"I loved the charm, the words are just emblazoned on the charms metal. The lettering has come off and I'm disappointed."
2.0,"The graphic is great, but the material is very thin and started to ball up and fade to white in several spots within wearing it 5 times. The sizing is also way off, even tho I used the sizing chart. I bought a Large to fit my boyfriend, and it was way to small. It barely fit me, and I wear a women's medium."
2.0,The pads in the cup move from it place and look bad
2.0,Buckle would not fit on my existing 1 inch strap.
2.0,It was not long at all. I couldn‚Äôt even wrap it around to make it look cute.
2.0,"I really liked the emotion on the bottom of the leg.  However, the pants are way too long and if I cut off the needed length, even after washing several times, the design is completely lost.  The pants are a bit snug as well and would suggest buying only if you are closer to 6 feet tall."
2.0,Way too small. Also felt kind of cheap.
2.0,"The inseams on these pants are not the same size as what is listed on the size chart. I have super long legs and these are like highwaters on me. They are pretty thin material, more like legging material than pants. and the buttons on the front are gawdy and stitched horrible on there so they stic off and wiggle around when you barely move. I would not buy these again."
2.0,"The description says that these run large. They aren‚Äôt large in the legs, very tight on the thighs."
2.0,"The small was tight at the bottom and really big at the top. The medium was too big everywhere. I bought this dress for my gender reveal. The colors are perfect and it would be super cute if it was cut right. The top is just way too big and loose. I normally wear a small. I'm 5'4, have an hourglass/athletic figure and with the pregnancy DD cup size and the top was still big and loose. I originally purchased a medium since I would be 4 months pregnant wearing it, but the medium was huge. The small was tighter at the bottom and fit in the legs, but then was short and again the top too big, so I couldn't wear it at all."
2.0,This just did not work for me. The material of the jumper was stiff and the sizing was too small in my opinion.
2.0,"Looks great on, but he material, after a couple of washes, pills, and looks cheap.  Waste of money."
2.0,Band loop that keeps band from flopping around broke in 1 month. I am so disappointed. Will not buy this again.
2.0,Unfortunately the clasps don't snap tightly and my watch band constantly comes undone.  I'll be looking for a different band.
2.0,Washed it before wearing it and threads coming undone üò©
2.0,"Counterfeit? These sandals showed up in a brown box, no label, just a plain brown box! Weird and a little sketchy. The item also showed up damaged where the piece that goes around the ankle was only half attached."
2.0,I own a Yorkie so I thought the mask was fun. It is really thin and silky so the filters dont stay in place very well. The mask doesnt want to stay in place either. Wouldnt recommend as COVID protection.
2.0,"It feels like a slip and see through, could not fit it. To small"
2.0,It's not as good as it looks in the picture. The shape is very odd and doesn't look good.
2.0,"Didnt like it at all the zippers seem to fall more so i have to keep fixing them and the whole thing itself doesnt look too good, havent worb it since i dont like it when ive tried it on."
2.0,"This dress is super cute, but super cheaply made. I read the reviews and knew the top was sheer, which is no problem there are ways around that. But this dress is extremely cheaply made. I am not sure if I got a bad dress or not. But it came out of the bag with one of the belt loops broken. I decided to just sew it together and not return and deal with the hassle. Yesterday was the first day the weather was perfect to wear this dress. I went to put on the straps and one broke immediately. The other looks like it is a matter of time. Thankfully my grandma is a seamstress so I‚Äôm going to ask her to help me make it where it‚Äôs not going to break everytime I touch it, but this is ridiculous."
2.0,Gold pair broke first wear
2.0,Necklace doesn't  hold the Energem Ranger Dino Prop Charge too heavy for the necklace.
2.0,I was really excited for this necklace because it was something different and would be fun to wear. I wore it a total of 3 hours before the chain snapped. It only cost me $1.70 so the saying &#34;You get what you pay for&#34; really applies here. I'll probably head to the craft store and repair it myself instead of returning it.
2.0,They look like the cheap plastic they are. I am tossing them. I will not recommend these to anyone. I am sorry I wasted my money.
2.0,It's a cute shirt and all but the size runs way too small. Order a size or maybe even 2 so you get a shirt that fits.
2.0,"Super cute but runs very small. I am usually a large, fits  very tight."
2.0,"I could have fit two of me in this dress, and I'm not a tiny woman.  For a bigger size woman, this may work.  It had a nice color, and the fabric was also nice.  I wish that it would have worked for me."
2.0,"Very thin hoodie, was not cotton but polyester. Spent alot for a knock off cheap imitation."
2.0,"I bought this to wear to a wedding, and loved it when I tried it on. I washed it cold water and hung it to dry and when I put it on the for wedding I ended up having to stand and the sleeves and pull the dress to try and stretch it out! I managed to still wear it, but I wish I could return it. I don't know how else you'd clean this thing if you can't even hang it to dry without it fitting my 4 year old!"
2.0,Looks like it is from a bubble gum machine.
2.0,I am not a small woman but I didn‚Äôt think I had larger than normal shins. Product was a bit small so it kept sliding down my leg.
2.0,"These socks are difficult to put on.  I checked and found that they only come in one size.  Not really happy about this but that's how they make 'em.<br /><br />Grace and Peace,<br />JRM"
2.0,"I was never able to wear this item. I tried it on and the bottom half (Pant) itched terribly (the dye), so I washed the outfit in mild detergent and cold water. The excessive dye from the black bottom bled into the white top and stained it. I have no idea how to get the staining out.<br />The bottom pant is stretchy thin spandex material. Not sturdy or what appeared to be a thicker material in the photo. It rides up into all your &#34;cracks&#34;, so wear an under garment (hosiery) under for the material to slide over rather than UP in your middle.<br />I'm dissappointed that I can't wear this item. It actually was cute besides the issues mentioned. At some point though, it has to be laundered and that will ruin it."
2.0,Too light weight for. Urgent COVID precautions  a waste of money not to mention false sense of doing what is right because these would give little to no protections to others
2.0,"Looks super cheap, not a good qulity. Do not recommend"
2.0,Fake and not good quality
2.0,This necklace was a mother's Day gift from my husband & it is absolutely beautiful BUT it tangles around itself HORRIBLY so unfortunately I will have to return it. Insert sad face.
2.0,These pants run very small. Returned.
2.0,Very cute...but way too little/too short. Shipping took longer than usual.
2.0,"Not great quality.  The cotton/spandex material is low quality.  The tummy panel is nice, except for the tight band around the top of the panel that cuts into your gut!  It completely defeats the purpose of the tummy panel.  Spend a little more money and get something that fits better and is better quality!!"
2.0,"Little support, covers good"
2.0,Sooo heavy and could have been more refined. Design was good can't sell it to anyone.
2.0,Cute but tore up my heels first time...I‚Äôm scared to even wear them ever again!
2.0,These are way too big for a 3 year old.
2.0,Dress fit very large.  The back was stretched out real loose and was see-through.  Just not very good quality.
2.0,"I really liked the style when I saw the photo, but there is one design feature, not apparent in the pics, that I don't like; the embroidery on the front has gold glitter all along it,  In my opinion, this takes away from its appeal, giving it an overdone quality.  The overall quality is what one would expect...  that is, somewhere between fair and poor.  I usually wear a medium, sometimes a large, and the XXL is a struggle to get into - it's not much of a stretch to imagine a seam splitting during the putting on or taking off of the blouse."
2.0,"These aren't shoes, it's a case for glasses."
2.0,"The dress is okay, it‚Äôs just falls kind of awkwardly."
2.0,Pants fit much larger than a medium.
2.0,This looks nothing like what‚Äôs in the picture it doesn‚Äôt have as many ruffles if any. It is a very nice skirt very light but just not as described.
2.0,I loved the pattern of the dress and style. I got the dress. Packing was great and so was delivery. Looking at the dress I see that it‚Äôs for a tall person. It goes all the way down to my ankles and dress under the arms sticks out.
2.0,"Small fit. Also, some design panels tighter than others."
2.0,I got Extra Large and they were too tight. Ordered Extra Large from another brand and they fit just fine. The quality appeared good a bit pricey.
2.0,I ordered this dress twice in two sizes. Both were unbuttonable. The once dress I ordered a good deal up and like I said I could t button it. This is made for people with small or a nonexistent rib cage. I returned both.
2.0,"The lenses on these were not clear - some distortion present right out of the package. The skinny pieces that sit behind the ears apply uncomfortable pressure so if you are prone to headaches, beware! I kept them as they were cheap and I feel I can use them as an emergency backup pair if needed."
2.0,"This beautiful, soft band came with a very crappy snap-in buckle that looks a lot thinner than on the photo. I don't trust it with my sports watch which could get caught on the bike's handle, a tree branch or a rock and snap off. Based on the photos, I was expecting a more secure buckle that's permanently attached to the band, instead of the spring-loaded little metal bar. I can pull off the buckle with my fingers if I just spread it a little. For a $10 piece of rubber, the manufacturer definitely shoud've used a better construction - a permanent or at least a thicker and stronger bar.<br /><br />The bars used to attach the bracelet to the watch seem a little better because they snap in deeper - they have a longer moving piece. But even they wobble a bit. This is definitely NOT good for a sports watch that gets a lot of movement and contact, and because of the weak buckle I wouldn't put it on a regular watch, either. Sorry, manufacturer, I hope you change your design because the band itself is excellent."
2.0,The material is cheap and isn‚Äôt the same as the pants version.  It was a little baggy at the armpits.  Just not cute.
2.0,"They look small so, I'm hoping they'll fit. Aside from that, they're cheaply made. Sequins are falling off and the unicorn sticker on the sole peeled off. I just received them and they're already peeling. Not worth the buy. I wish I could add a pic to show you, but I'm not given the option to do so ü§î"
2.0,"as thin as i wanted it to be but the writing is not noticeable, will do for now"
2.0,The hardware is not the same. Silver chain and gold zippers. Leather is good quality just the hardware was not consistent
2.0,Did not like the way it looked horny
2.0,need a large  sz
2.0,"Not same color as in photo, more or a blue than black fits weird straps placed very poor"
2.0,IF YOU WANT BIG GHETTO EARRINGS THESE ARE FOR YOU.  I HATED THEM AND RETURNED THEM
2.0,I‚Äôve only worn it about a week and it has stretched out so much it‚Äôs too loose to use.
2.0,The material is cheap and I don't wear It at all.
2.0,This bookbag is terribly small i would return it but i dont feel like going through the hassle  i wish the would of had the bag on a persons back to simulate  how  accurately  small the book bag is
2.0,I would go a size up. It runs small.  The material is nice but is a little short.
2.0,"This is my second Dickinson cap, and I must say I‚Äôve not been pleased with it because rain drops roll off the top, down into the horizontal vents and into my double wall piping. I always find a puddle on top of my stove and I‚Äôm certain the piping will eventually rust. I had a great experience with my previous Dickinson cap (it resembled an ‚ÄúH‚Äù and was designed for high winds. I have checked all the pipe fittings, flashing, etc and sealed the top of the cap. My only solution now is to install some type of top plate to creat a drip ledge that extends beyond the vertical sides of the cap, or to just get a different cap. This one was expensive, and I wanted my woodstove setup to be perfect this time, so I didn‚Äôt hesitate to purchase it.  Now I know not to order this one for future tiny house builds."
2.0,After one wash the cobra emblem is starting to wear off.
2.0,"Tha charm itself is beautiful in detailing and sheen, as pictured, but as I‚Äôve come to expect from Amazon necklace chain purchases a bit too budgeted, the clasp failed within the first 12 hours. No matter... pleased with my bent - tail dragonfly pendant.... as an homage to many things.. both in myth and mysticism, as methods of mellowing times of the meek."
2.0,"this ring looks cheap in person. Also, it was too tight on my finger according to the size I ordered."
2.0,"This navel piercing looks lovely. However, after a few weeks the metal at the back of the heart turned green. I would recommend it for occasional wear, not for long-time. I was so excited about the look and the low price, but if you want to wear it daily, get an all-steel piercing to make sure there are no chemical reactions going on between your skin and the metal... Just to be safe."
2.0,The jeans have weird stitching on back pockets.  Front pockets  are short.  My phone doesn‚Äôt fit. I ordered 2 pairs. Will keep one
2.0,I liked the style and the revo blue but rubbing off dust or smears ruins the coating. It just begins to rub off. I used the same spray and cleaning cloth I use on my glasses and the blue coating began rubbing off quickly. I ordered a second pair thinking maybe just a light rub with no glass solution would work better. It did not. The glass case is really nice and easy to spot but the coating is just far too easily removed with wear and even gentle cleaning.
2.0,"Neat concept, but buckle is too large and bulky for it to be useful or be able to wear comfortably."
2.0,"The sunglasses are so nice, but they arrived crooked :( it was hard to bend back to the way I wanted them"
2.0,The screen is not very clear.  It‚Äôs even more difficult to see when you expel carbon dioxide. Screen scratches really easy also
2.0,Nice but I really wanted Red- it was dark pink. I was disappointed.
2.0,Didn‚Äôt like anything about this purse. No place for coins/cash. Credit card slots were difficult to get in and out. 2 zipper compartments that I have no idea what to put in them. Too narrow.
2.0,KEPT FALLING OFF MY FACE.
2.0,I've bought my fair share in cheap sunglasses and thes have to be the worst quality I've had. Lenses pop out every time I try to clean them.
2.0,"Looks sloppy with unsewn hems, otherwise would've been a great find. returned mine"
2.0,The shorts ran small and the compression shorts had less support than I had hoped. Returning the shorts.
2.0,XL fits like a large.  And the zipper is on the side it would normally be for a woman's vest.
2.0,"I loved this item at first. Thin, smooth and non scratchy...  nice fit, coverage without being granny panties.  I wore them right away because I originally purchased for backpacking and wanted to test them out ahead.<br />Less than 24 hours later they are starting to lose shape and will soon be falling down (which is not a problem I‚Äôve ever had due to my ample rear end and waist size)."
2.0,"The elastic in the waist only expands 1 inch,  which is great for women whose hips are only 1 inch bigger than their waist.  I returned it, might had considered exchange if the liner had not resembled plastic so much.  The skirt itself was fine, just need to go back to the design board and rethink the waist and liner."
2.0,"This dress looked so cute online but you get what you pay for. The blue in the top of the dress was a totally different blue than the chevron stripe in the bottom of the dress, making it look a lot less attractive in person than it did in the pictures. As far as fit goes, I wear a medium or occasionally a large, but I ordered a large since i am 5'7&#34; tall and the dress reviews said it ran a bit short. On me the large fit ok, but I still could've worn the medium as far as the fit for width goes. However, it was much shorter on me than I prefer maxi dresses to be (well above the ankle). I'm returning this dress for a refund.<br /><br />Edited to add: Jessy was very friendly and responsive to my concerns. She sent me a new dress in a different size to try to make things right. Unfortunately in going up a size, the dress was way too big in the width, and the length was still super short. Great customer service, but I just can't recommend this dress."
2.0,"If you are tall it may be nice.  Guess I didn't read length or it did not say.  Way to long.  Tried to hem, but didn't hang right after"
2.0,"I ordered 2 shirts from this company. Both are XXL and both are more like a large or an XL at best. Very annoying and disappointing. I have ordered many XXL camp shirts from a variety of manufacturers that have fit well.  Unfortunately, both shirts I ordered are too small."
2.0,The pant runs 2-3 sizes too small and are not long enough
2.0,Face shield too crumpled to use.
2.0,I had an iriginal Head Gasket. A few actually. Had them years and years and they began to die so I looked for a replacement. These won't last very long as mine is delaminating already after only a short time. Must be less expensive neoprene.
2.0,"These are supposedly the same gauge that my piercing is, but they are much bigger. Unless you have been widening your holes don't waste your time or money."
2.0,Earrings arrived with stone missing
2.0,I bought for my daughter and once she opened it one of the finger  bands was broke.
2.0,"I returned it, I am 5‚Äô2, 144lbs, curvy, I went a size down and ordered a small since I noticed some reviews that say it runs large. It was still too big in some areas, also too long for me, and the color was a little brighter than expected, the fabric also didn‚Äôt hold shape as I expected, maybe because it was big to begin with I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm bummed out, but had to send it back."
2.0,First time I put it on. There was a rip in the side seam.  I loved this sweater otherwise.  Very disappointed in the quality.
2.0,"It's too small and cheap quality. The color is more of an antique rose, not the coffee color I expected. I'm returning it."
2.0,I have a big nose so they were way too small
2.0,The metal part seem corrided ir miscolored. Never to purse out of bag. Put it back in the box and will return to Amazon.
2.0,The kimono is super cute but the top and bottom feel like pajamas. Also the holes for the buttons are sewn shut. Had to get scissors and cut them open. Also the position of the hair clip is awkward and it makes it hard to place it on your head properly.
2.0,Not great and definitely not cotton
2.0,didn't like the leather to stiff
2.0,"I originally found this bikini on Groupon. It was on sale for $21.99, but I figured I would least attempt to search it in hopes of better deal. I typed in the exact description as Groupon had and boom! AMAZON WINS AGAIN!<br />I was sketchy on what size to choose tho 'cause &#34;73% found it smaller than expected&#34;  so I ordered one size bigger. Once I tried it on, top was too big across shoulders and bottom was extremely tight. Sucks because both of my besties, who happen to be sisters, we're going buy in different colors because we are strange haha but I told them it wasn't worth ordering because I can't even wear mine in public. Very sad it didn't work out üò≠"
2.0,Bought this dress expecting it to be red but it is closer to a coal color.  It also did not fit and I ordered up in sizes.
2.0,"Loves the way it looks and is very comfortable, but I am always on the go and very busy so I forget to take it off most of the time before I shower. I can already see the color change, which is sad because it‚Äôs such a cute anklet."
2.0,"I really loved these earrings when I got them but after only a few months, they have corroded badly."
2.0,It broke the first day I put it on!
2.0,"I had not noticed pleats in the picture, did not like the pleat style look."
2.0,"Cute shoe, but runs very small and narrow. I tried the next size up and it was still way too small."
2.0,Smaller than it looked in add
2.0,"Wouldn't stay on my foot, kept sliding off"
2.0,"Too boxy round the middle.  I feel like I'm wearing a tent.  Also, had trouble with the button holes with the threads catching on the button.  Not a fan.  I'll have a seamstress or tailor fit this to my shape a little better, but that's going to be additional expense I'd rather not have.  I'd return the shirt for a refund, but my wife threw out the packaging materials..."
2.0,Feels very flimsy and of poor quality. Returned because didn't want to give as gift
2.0,The material is not what i expected or looked like in the picture . i haven‚Äôt worn it just tried on smaller then the size guide says an it‚Äôs shiny . o don‚Äôt like it
2.0,"I returned item, it was too small and the fabric was not soft"
2.0,The sole split after only 2 wears :(
2.0,"Too tight, thin material. You can slightly see through it."
2.0,"It‚Äôs a cute top, true to color but it does run a bit short.  I have a long torso and it just barely touched the end of it."
2.0,"The material is light and it's a very pretty garment. I just had to return it because even though I ordered a size small, it was still way to big on me. I have a small frame & it did not look flattering."
2.0,Frames are too small and look like kiddie glasses
2.0,Not for an adult ... good price if you can get pass the extremely long wait for delivery... good fit for a 9 year okd
2.0,Cheap plastic but not bad if all you need to do is re stretch or stretch larger.
2.0,They do not transition at all....only clear
2.0,One of the lanyards was missing a silver attachment. So far the others are working fine.
2.0,There ok but they really hurt my ears. can't wear them for very long
2.0,"I ordered XL,i wear M and these gloves are almost too small"
2.0,"Cheap band. Face has cracked twice now. Looks fantastic and am complimented every time I wear it. It is HUGE, but I grew to love the look."
2.0,The shield is not easy fit with any eyeglasses. I also bought a medium size but more for small eyeglasses
2.0,I recently bought this item and the band is too wide for my wrist. So do bring it to a jewelry shop and have them size it? Wasn't expecting all the hassle. But the quality and color is almost too perfect.
2.0,"This jacket was to replace one just like it that I bought years ago and was recently damaged. However, the new one may look the same it is not. Russell is now using a thinner and rougher feeling fabric than before. The first one was 80% cotton and 20% poly. The new one is 52% poly and 48% cotton. Would not buy it again."
2.0,Beautiful shirt if you are a trim person. I wear large top due to my bra size so I bought the shirt in an XL to be safe. Not even close. Way too tight which is a bummer because the shirt is really pretty.
2.0,The charm was nice but the necklace wasn't great
2.0,Poorly made the seams are bulging. And I M disappointed I needed this for this weekend so I have to use it. I am sure it will not last long.
2.0,"Didn't even try it on as the color was off from the picture online.  It was way more red, orange, light orange than any other color."
2.0,"Way, way too small, can't wait to see it, on my sons girlfriend.. I'm normally a  2x, I have no idea, why I thought it would fit me."
2.0,Too ripped as soon as I put it on.
2.0,The steel is good quality but the length of the gage falls short for me. If you have thicker lobes I wouldn't recommend.
2.0,Super cute dress but the strap completely broke after ONE wash
2.0,"Not what I expected for the price! floppy cotton cap. not crisp, sharp edges on cap face"
2.0,"For me, the XL started off too short and only shrunk up more after it was washed (in cold water)."
2.0,"Bridesmaids dress, looked amazing on me. I received multiple compliments on how great I looked. The high slit was perfect."
2.0,It wasn't silver. It was a grey that looked old
2.0,The pants are so tight . The material doesn't streach . I bought 12 to 18 months for my 7 months old baby and her both legs cannot even go up the jeans. My baby is of regular size
2.0,Looks more like costume jewelry than I expected.
2.0,"I was wearing this. While I was playing with my daughter, it broke around the cat and the necklace. Try and find a way for a sturdy neck piece"
2.0,Very disappointed!! Too large under arms and waist!
2.0,The arms of these gloves are really tight. My grandson is a thin 20 month old and these are too tight.
2.0,Small and short buy a bigger size up
2.0,Definitely see through. Thin fabric and runs small.
2.0,Dress appears cheaply made and has a rip in the middle. :(.
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt really look like the picture. The sleeves are so big they are like a huge flare.. not my style
2.0,Pay attention to the size before you purchase
2.0,Fabric was colorful but garment construction was poor in stitching and fabric used is cheap. Not enough stretch as the size chart indications portrayed.
2.0,It‚Äôs a shame the zippers and straps are so cheap because the canvas is attractive.<br />I would not buy again unless I needed a pack for an occasional situation. It‚Äôs not a pack meant for school or work and will not last very long
2.0,really too heavy for every-day wear.
2.0,Nice blouse but apparently runs pretty small. Had to return due to fit.
2.0,these shirts run super smal...!  be careful. i told my friends to just keep scrolling if they see them.
2.0,"The fabric is pretty good, although thinner and less ribbed/textured than expected. The color is gorgeous, and the shirt fits well (although definitely runs oversized)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the shorts are terrible. The drawstring is insanely long (I measured - 2 feet of extra string fabric to try and tie - wtf)<br /> I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and 125lbs, slightly curvy in the hips/thighs and bought a size small.<br />The pockets fall out constantly (like, they get turned inside out and hang out of the shorts...) Literally the only time the pockets aren‚Äôt flipping out is when my hands are in them.<br />They‚Äôre also just a weird fit. They don‚Äôt fit well worn high-rise, and look even worse at/below natural waistline.<br /><br />I‚Äôm keeping the set because I like the top and it‚Äôs a pain to return... but definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
2.0,Is to very small
2.0,"This dress was excellent material, the problem being it was way too long"
2.0,"Item arrived and the figures are in blue, not white as shown in the photo for the shirt."
2.0,"Much too small. So small I couldn't even wear it. Too bad, b/c it feels nice. Very soft and seems well made, but I'll never know, b/c it's too small to wear."
2.0,"ordered for my shoe size and can't get them up past my ankles.  if you have heavier calves, try another brand."
2.0,"Cheap in quality, but then again, it‚Äôs costume jewelry."
2.0,This dress was a fail for me. The fabric is poor quality and its way too short. I would not recommend!
2.0,Ordered  3XL AND IT FIT MY SIZE 14 SISTER!
2.0,Like the tshirts and ordered a size up and still wasn't able to put his head through it
2.0,They didnt appear to be flip ups so I had to return them
2.0,I had ordered one of these dresses full length from a different seller and thought this would be the same. IT IS NOT. Super cheap feeling material. Sits weird on my body. Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be so disappointed if the full length wasn‚Äôt so nice but this dress is worth no more than $5. I paid like $6 while it was clearanced so it not a huge loss and not with returning but def a bummer.
2.0,A little tight in the pants if you have a bottom!
2.0,I don‚Äôt think these are children socks but they feel like it or they were made for people with very small calves. My pikachu actually evolved to a Raichu when I put them on.
2.0,They remind me how much weight I need to lose
2.0,"I thought this would be a cute top for evening games. The shirt itself is okay, however the arm area is extremely tight, I tried it on & everything fit but the arm area, I'm sure it might stretch out but I'm sending it back."
2.0,I ordered a toddler cowboy hat and it's too big
2.0,"These are not normal tank tops, these are racer back tank tops and they falsely don't tell you. These are also pretty much see through in the light. Won't be buying again."
2.0,Runs very small and the fabric was thin.  Not what I wanted.
2.0,This is just a strange dress. You'd need to order it at least one size up for it to look like the photo. The bottom is a body con and the top is oversized. Just doesn't flatter anyone.
2.0,"Stopped working within a week. Will not charge or turn on. I have a similar product that is a head band so I was excited for the beanie version for winter. Have not returned since it was only 12 bucks, not worth the trip to ship it back. If I decide to replace it and it works I will change my review. I could have just got a dud."
2.0,"I wrote to the seller and he graciously replaced the shirt with another, however, the graphics still didn't cling to the fabric.  not worth the price of $18.00."
2.0,The button came off after a few hours. Really disappointed
2.0,Glasses were bent
2.0,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 104lbs 32D. The small was too big. It doesn‚Äôt look like the picture. It is a lot smaller than appears but doesn‚Äôt fit right. Maybe I should have got an extra small, but I don‚Äôt have time now for what I was going to wear it for."
2.0,Took 3 weeks to arrive.  Very short cord. Won't stay in watch.
2.0,this top was very cute but a large was huge. it looks more like a maternity top
2.0,These earrings are well made and I like the style but they are HUGE!!  Larger than dimensions given in description.  Disappointed but waited too long to contact seller for a return.
2.0,I ordered the American flag shirt and the design was nothing like the picture. The picture on here shows just red white and blue but you get a greenish white and burgundy red. The Stars literally look green. Super disappointed. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one was that the material and stitching was good.
2.0,I wear a 1x in men‚Äôs.<br />The pants fit my daughter that wears a Medium in men‚Äôs
2.0,Looks better online.
2.0,I did not like this fabric. It felt like plasticky cotton and had an odd shine.<br /><br />One of the least nice items I've received from Yesno.
2.0,"Really big, almost adult size."
2.0,I love this type of band but it doesn‚Äôt compare to the more expensive brands. It‚Äôs ok but I would not purchase again
2.0,Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money. I have soft hair and it slides off.
2.0,The clicker is extremely hard to get into place. But I like the look.
2.0,I bought this for a gift and was so cheap looking I didn‚Äôt even give it away.
2.0,"The tail looked like it had been used for several years!!  It was matted and scruffy.  It was also a very small (short) tail.  The headband was a better item, but still lacked quality."
2.0,"Material was not as expected, very cheap made. Button at top broke as soon as I tried it on the first time. Already returned."
2.0,Dial Looks bigger than the picture
2.0,I love these legging I live in Germany and they get me through the winter  my only concern is my latest order was missing the colors that I ordered.
2.0,"Beautiful swimsuit, but runs way too small. I'm 5&#34; and weigh about 120. I could not fit in a size large. Need to return"
2.0,wasn't crazy about how the back fit.... it covered too much lol It's great if that's what you're looking for. I like the brazilian look better myself.
2.0,its very cheaply made the paint they use was already half worn off by the time i got it it feels like its going to fall apart in my hand but its a cute idea if it was done better
2.0,Flimsy removeable cups do not stay in place and fold up during washing.  It won't be long before they aren't worth much at all.  Not impressed.  They should have been sewn in.
2.0,Material wasn‚Äôt made as expected like jogging pants- more like linens and cotton blend with no stretch for additional leg room and comfort
2.0,They leak after a few months
2.0,The gold plates fell off after the first use
2.0,"Cute enough to keep but very poorly made, flimsy."
2.0,Lamentablemente el vestido de ba√±o vino en la talla incorrecta. Est√° muy lindo pero no vino la talla que solicit√©.
2.0,I love the corset but the measurements are not what is listed. I bought a large per the measurements and it was too small. I had to leave a 2.5-3 inch gap in the tie ups in the back for it to fit.
2.0,The handles do not stay in place. They come undone and one is left holding a handle strap.  It is embarrassing. I would not not purchase again.
2.0,"Fabric not very good quality.  Wrinkles easily,"
2.0,Extremely tight in back and chest.<br />Hips fit well
2.0,i ordered a large and the shirt fits like a small way to big of a difference between sizes...  pick something way bigger then you normal size
2.0,Too delicated
2.0,Cute but heavy and the bar is long so the earring doesn‚Äôt stay in one position.
2.0,The side seam is not even lined up right. Last time to buy this brand.
2.0,Didn't realize the shirt was a half size only comes to the top of your belly and not a full shirt. Otherwise it would be great if that's what I wanted.üòî
2.0,"The deal was a steal, but I've already thrown one away because the cloth separated from the elastic after the first wash. The fit was as expected, patterns great. Will not be purchasing again though."
2.0,I got this for my wife who is Danish. I mermaid is her favorite. The item is actually a locket. It arived with a big dent in the back. I believe this was do to bad packaging for shipment.
2.0,Very  thin!
2.0,"I don't know if mine was defective, but even though it felt very sticky one side would not stay stuck for more than 5 minutes. I wear these types of bras all the time but this was my first time trying this brand and this is the only one I've ever had an issue with. I had to send it back.<br /><br />Update 8/25/16: After Komene saw my review they sent me another bra free of charge, even though I had already returned and been refunded for the other one. The second one works slightly better but still won't stay on all day. Because it's slightly better I increased my review to 2 stars from 1. The case it comes in, however would get a 5 star rating. It's very nice."
2.0,There were no pairs
2.0,but not great. You need a very small hand to pass by. Color so and so. Good for children masquerade
2.0,"I read other reviews about them and I was a little skeptical if they would fit and be too loose around my calfs. I received it pretty quickly and tried them on. The size was just as expected, My feet are narrow and shoe size is a 7.5. My legs are not that big either and if I didn't tighten the belt on the boot for the calf they would have been really loose.<br />So, I wasn't expecting these shoes to be too authentic especially since it's under $30. These boots weren't as sturdy and heavy as they looked on the photos and the photos make it look nicer than what they actually are. They felt more like plastic, light and fake--Like wearing black plastic bags around my legs.<br />even though they weren't what the photos looked like they would be, I would still wear it --for now. You get what you pay for."
2.0,"Just plastic, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything.  My kids played with it for about 5 min."
2.0,"I can't say I like these earrings all that much.  They are very thin, tend to catch onto things like clothes being pulled on or off over my head, and on pillows if I forget to take them out.  When they get stuck they catch they stretched out and I have to bend them back.  I wore these for about 2 days and when I took them out the metal had tarnished into another color and looked bad.  I can't advise buying these and mine aren't going to get tossed since they're Sterling silver, but I doubt I'll be wearing them anymore."
2.0,Way too long to receive. Definitely cut small. Order a size or two bigger.
2.0,"This bag is definitely not leather!!!! Beware!<br /> It was packed very poorly. It was folded with no stuffing inside! The fold marks remain! I tried stuffing hoping it could regain its shape but it didn't!<br />Color is great, design is great! Giving 2 stars for that.<br />Returning it!"
2.0,Didn't realize slip was so short. Picture looks much better
2.0,Zipper broke after a couple of weeks.<br />Too bad because it was exactly what I wanted
2.0,"I ordered this before, I thought from Amazon, come to find out it was from Ebay.When it arrived my daughter noticed how plastic it was. My daughter put it on her arm one day later it broke. I searched e-bay and reordered. Not great quality."
2.0,It is a good watch. The greatest fault is that it‚Äôs hands are black in a black background. In a quick check for time you literally have to search for the hands. This is my biggest frustration. The hands ought to be white and bright. I really have to consider replacing it.
2.0,Extremely thin and cheap material.  You get what you pay for.  I would not buy again.
2.0,Came from China which seams to make all sizing differ.  Too small for an XL that I ordered.
2.0,it's not same material that it looks like in picture.  it's more like thin costume like material
2.0,This coat is very flimsy and thin.  The red material is scratchy. Doesn‚Äôt seem well made at all.  My teenage son normally wears a medium size tee shirt but I should‚Äôve ordered a small for him because the medium was a little too large in the chest and arms. Definitely not worth $45.
2.0,"The dress arrived today and despite no reviews, I expected...too much...and this is...too much in a negative sense. For starters, pleats are on top of an otherwise beautiful lace and if this was not loud enough, the dress is the kind that you hace to stretch to your size: everything below the bust is essentially a huge elastic band. To top it all off there is a faux collar and peplum of 3/4 sleeves. It just kept giving because being petite, this dress is essentially floor length. Essentially the only thing this dress has going for it is that ir photographs well when I actually managed to get it in frame."
2.0,I like the style but it doesn‚Äôt come in 3xl which would fit like a regular 2xl
2.0,It broke within weeks of wearingit
2.0,"Off the bat it didn‚Äôt work. One of the wires was kinked. The glue that holds the pad on failed instantly. With a little effort, I got it working."
2.0,"This runs so small that it's not even worth trying to buy. It was cute, but I got an extra large and it fit my friend that wears a medium and it was even a little tight on her."
2.0,"Took over a month to arrive and when wearing it, it feels like its twisted."
2.0,Okay. Whole dress very see-through and thin. Not very good quality.
2.0,Ordered a size Large and XL of this product.  Had 6 different sizes of people try these on.  The person who typically wears a medium fit the XL.  The person who normally wears size Small fit into the Large.
2.0,far too small to be a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù if you get these and are even the slightest bit curvy i‚Äôd be careful and probably size up 2 sizes
2.0,These are advertised as sweat pants but they are barely lounging around pajama pants. Not even close to nice material or print. 2 stars only because it fits and the color was correct
2.0,The bottoms fit perfect but the top was too big. I am a size 2 and a 32C  bra and I just could not get a right fit! Sad because i loved this suit for laps at the gym!
2.0,"I got this for my husband. It is a little bit too wide for his belt loops, however, it is stylish and durable."
2.0,Too narrow!
2.0,They are way to big.
2.0,I‚Äôm not sure how the sizing is supposed to work on this dress. I‚Äôm normally a medium so that‚Äôs what I ordered. The dress fits everywhere except the chest area. It does not lay like the pictures. The dress would be perfect if it did but I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a defect or what.
2.0,The top is a nice shade of pink with a matching unicorn design on the front. The unicorns on the bottoms are more of a coral or orange shade and do not coordinate with the top. Very odd.
2.0,This is as good as the most priducts in this category. It would not work on top of eye glasses. I wear rather small size eye glasses and found these googles as not wearable with my eye glasses.
2.0,Runs too small...had to return.
2.0,Glasses broke after 4 weeks of use. Hinges are fine but the leg breaks off where the hinge ends.
2.0,I bought one but ordered the wrong size so I ordered another one and it literally broke the first time I put it on. Don‚Äôt waste your money
2.0,"Wanted to love this hat. It seems to be a well constructed hat, but the notches do not line up with any of my sunglasses.<br />Disappointing. I have hats that I like to wear. I was really hoping this hat would accommodate my sunglasses. It simply does not."
2.0,The white material is thin. You can see your nipples and chest hair through it
2.0,I got the purple color and it was way brighter than in the picture. The chest area was a little tight on me but the waist was too big. The fit was weird and the color was not at all what I expected so Unfortunately i returned it
2.0,"The jumpsuit looked like the pictures, but the fit was off. It's made of a thick, coarse cotton which is good because it's not see-through. However, I'm a DD in the bust so the top part puckered in a weird way when I tied it. Unfortunately, it just didn't work for me so I'm returning it."
2.0,"Not what I expected for the price, better off going to Kohl's and getting kid suit"
2.0,cute but too small!
2.0,Thin and really lose around my head
2.0,Just simply way to small for what I wanted it for be grate for maybe kindergarten kids.
2.0,Item does not hold up well. The head flops and I had to put  the strap around my neck to hold up the head. I would not recommend this item.
2.0,It's beautiful but not very comfortable
2.0,"Material is cheap<br />If your thighs rub together at all, the material makes an audible sound"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:84b6b64bc5e35968efc66bb06cd3565c]] I purchased 9/30 it broke 11/5. My son literally wore this for less than 3 weeks. Not durable at all!  He said it was comfortable while it lasted
2.0,The design is fine and the colors are cool. But my watch band started breaking within a month of buying and now 3 months in it is completely broken. I use it normally and it‚Äôs under no more stress than the normal wear and tear of a watch worn every day as it should be. Not what I expected from a quality standpoint.
2.0,Looks really weird and wrinkle city!
2.0,Doesn‚Äôt fit well with the factory key fob.
2.0,Way too short.  Sent them back.  High water pants lol
2.0,Not the shirt advertised
2.0,"Within 2 washes, the soles of the socks ripped.  Poorly made, and a rip off considering the price.  I would return, but my 9 year old son was heartbroken that these didn't last, so he promptly threw them out.  Don't waste your money on these."
2.0,"Returned this one.  Stripes on the left side 'sort of' line up wide and horizontally.  Not at all flattering or in line with the photos.  Also, the straps have that uncomfortable feeling of possibly slipping off your shoulders leaving your bare-breasted while in the water."
2.0,I'm sorry but this is not right. My large fits more like a small!! I could barely get my arms through the sleeves. I don't have time to go through the shenanigans of returns and exchanges. That not fair to consumers! The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the material is very nice for the price.
2.0,I ordered a 2XL and  looks like a small. Runs  way too small.
2.0,super dark and look really similar to the glasses you wear in the tanning bed. mine were also crooked.
2.0,"I wear a 2 XL comfortably, I ordered a 3xl to be safe and the were still too small. They are well made from decent material."
2.0,Great for a small child. Really short. Not as advertised!
2.0,Disappointed at how the hearts are so small and flimsy. I do appreciate that they are double flare and not screw back at least.
2.0,"This  shirt is not a true red; it has strong coral undertones. It's hard to tell at first, but when I held it next to a true red, it was clearly an orange-red.  Also, the arm holes are too large in proportion to the rest of the shirt.  The shirt is a good quality, not all thin and clingy. For me, the color and large arm holes are the deal breaker, so I'm returning."
2.0,Material poor quality- not best fit
2.0,"I purchase this for when I run. The moment I starter to run it got its started jumping with me and turning caused by my ear phone cord to get twisted around my waist. It‚Äôs a good size, would probably work if you were walking."
2.0,"Pretty disappointed in this belt.  The first one I received had the buckle sewed on backwards, I returned for refund and ordered again.  The second one started out nice but within the 10th time of wearing it the stitching in the leather area has stated to unravel.  The buckle is too tight for the leather area causing it to rub when hitching the belt‚Äî that has resulted in the stitching starting to unravel.  Nice looking belt when new but it already looks worn out.  I will not repurchase this belt."
2.0,Am returning.  Clasplease brokenx2
2.0,"Fits small and The collar is big, so if you go one size bigger then the collar would be huge"
2.0,Gave to my 5 year old.too small
2.0,Espero que a mi hija le guste lo compre para ella
2.0,"too small. I ordered an extra large, too small, then reordered an XXL and still fits too small. I normally wear a Large. Returned them all"
2.0,"My daughter wears a 6.5, the reviews said they fit a little large so I got a 6 and they are still way too big. My niece wears a 7 and they're to big for her also."
2.0,"My wife loves these pants I gave her for xmas.. however, we washed them in the washing machine and now all the clothes that were in there have glitter permanently all over them.  We rewashed them and you can't get the glitter out.  Gee thanks, I have to go to work with glitter on my shirt, I really appreciate that!"
2.0,They should work well but they are extremely small. I plan to purchase another set for our vacation because I do not think these will hold enough.
2.0,"The material is sweaty and poor, easy to rip. Came with a small tear in the crotch and it only got bigger after wearing a few times."
2.0,Worn once. Was ADORABLE! Shrink after 1st wash
2.0,Item was see though! Couldn‚Äôt wear to work!
2.0,There is NO way to connect it in the back. So the picture is very misleading. Not long enough to even tie it in the back.
2.0,This sunglasses looks very cheap and do not provide as much protection from sun and glare as it was advertized. Backside glass is scratched like it was a second hand item.Very disappointed!
2.0,Ok print and light fabric
2.0,"The band is easy to adjust, and easy to get on and off. That's exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the material somehow caused a rash on my wrist. I've worn Fitbit wristbands since they first came out. I've never had this happen with any Fitbit band, whether the elastomer material or nylon."
2.0,"Straps are sewn on wrong, so one doesn‚Äôt have polka dots on it snd is just solid. Really stands out when 1 out of 6 straps is different. Straps also slip down a lot. Otherwise, a cute dress"
2.0,"The sleeve throw me off, I live in Jamaica so I don't need long sleeves, I order short sleeves and I got long and the worst part that the only part of the dress that's tight otherwise I love the dress it's cute."
2.0,"The sizing on these is all wrong! Ordered a toddler size 1 and the were big enough for my sister to wear, a women‚Äôs size 8!"
2.0,Arrived quick and is a very pretty design. A lot bigger then expected and would look tacky if I were to wear them. They also seem to be of cheap quality.
2.0,Gave it to a friend cause it didn't fit
2.0,"Pretty, but too cheap looking to use in a wedding. Good for costume."
2.0,Coat was too small.  It was my size so in description it should have said fits smaller than expected.  Now I have to go through the terrible hassle of returning  it
2.0,"Sleeves too short and the body is really wide.  Ordered a men's small, looks like a 14 Husky.  Unless you are short and fat, don't bother.  Stick with name brand stuff when shopping Amazon."
2.0,Like the TSLA brand [a lot] and have had several really good experiences with pants and shirts. These however do not fit well. Sleeves are too short.
2.0,"I was a little disappointed. The earrings I got were the colorful gel spiked kind, not anything like the earings in the picture."
2.0,"This shouldnt be called a ""phone wallet"" case. Just because you can put your phone in the zipper part, doesnt make it a case. A few weeks into having the wallet, the cards are already starting to fall out of it. The zipper seems cheap and gets caught on nothing. Not my favorite for a wallet, or to hold my phone."
2.0,For some reason these seem to run a little big. My son always wears a medium in Nike brand but these leggings are very large on him. I would make sure to size down.
2.0,Purchased Feb 2017 directly from Nexbelt.  Buckle broke from regular use May 2021. Obviously bad lever design. See picture.
2.0,Just flopped around
2.0,Not the most flattering even on an athletic body
2.0,"I bought 4 wigs on Amazon and this one was by far the worst. It had the least amount of hair, and the tracks were visible from just about every angle."
2.0,I normally wear a size large in jacket styles like thus jacket but can often wear a medium thats fitted. But after reading others review i decided to go all of the way up yo an XL and oh my goodness it like a Medium!
2.0,"These look dark purple not blue, probably won‚Äôt wear them"
2.0,"I bought this item on December 12. It broke in the middle of doing my constructed gel nails last night, less than two months later. Talk about a lot of filing by hand.<br /><br />Overheats easily. Like the adjustable speed options."
2.0,The box they come in is worth more than the glasses. You get what you pay for.
2.0,Sad thought it would have nude under the lace it black in black and not the lace detail shown in the picture.
2.0,"Don't seem to be any better than the ones at the $1.00 store.  After a week of using them, I'm dissapointed"
2.0,"The shirt itself is quite thick and seems like decent quality. The screenprint quality is poor. I was so excited to wear this shirt that I didn't even wash it before wearing it. After one wear the screenprint is cracked in multiple places. I wasn't expecting superb quality, but I was expecting that it would at least have a few wears before any cracking to the screenprint."
2.0,Fabric is super cheap. The hat was way too big! The fabric is so thin it's best for the summer. I wasn't happy with the material but my son looked cute in it. I dodnt think it would would up in the wash but it did.
2.0,Paper thin!!! Way overpriced for a paper jacket
2.0,"Its more of an athletic material with just a little bit of fuzz on the inside. I expected this to keep my son a little warmer for the winter, but this seems more like an early fall/spring kinda outfit"
2.0,I honestly don‚Äôt know how they got it to look like it does on the model. That fabric in the front looks so awkward. Ended up returning.
2.0,"Dress looks nice quality. I am 5'7&#34;,225pounds, 36DD  and actually I was not able to try this dress ,because the chest and arms area (sleeves)  are so small and tight that I can't pull it down. Unacceptable sizing for XL.(if i got XL,because there's no any label with the size. Everything is written in Chinese, unacceptable)<br />Very disappointed. Returning."
2.0,"Well, the design is cute, but the material is so thin, and they're so tight that they're stretched out. Better for someone with skinny legs."
2.0,THE FABRIC USED FOR THE LINING WAS FLIMSY AND RIPPED APART FROM THE ZIPPPER AREA WITHIN A FEW DAYS.
2.0,The chain came apart as soon as I took it out of the package.
2.0,"For the money I had hoped for a better result.  One of the lenses fit perfectly, the other was too big.  I sanded the larger lens edge with 800 grit wet paper, using the original lens for guide, and made it fit."
2.0,"I bought the bag for my 11 year old niece.  She wanted something like it for school,  but it's not big enough for books and school supplies.  I had to buy a backpack. We kept the bag since my niece likes it and she uses it for day trips. It'd a cute bag but it's not practical for school."
2.0,"They are pretty earrings but much smaller than I anticipated. I realize it shows the actual length, but the image of the mannequin wearing them led me to believe they would be large. Very very small."
2.0,These sunglasses didn't even last me a month. It broke within a few weeks of getting it. Oh well. You get what you pay for.
2.0,"They are good for people with very skinny legs because they are very tight. They are pretty, have nice colors, and the fabric seems good, but too tight!"
2.0,"I bought this robe for my mother for a Christmas present.  She is a small, and I ordered a small, but it was way too big."
2.0,"Is a cute outfit but it runs really small, I ordered 18 month size and my baby usually wears 12 months but this was just too tight on her."
2.0,I had worn them and they cut my ears and my ears started bleeding because they pinch . Also my one starfish looks like the picture the other starfish was silver instead of the gold in the middle
2.0,This thing is so expensive and they can't even get the fabric to be all one color. It's super faded. Horrible.
2.0,Looks very cute but straps are extremely uncomfortable.
2.0,Very difficult to unscrew and reattach the back. Super small and had to have someone help me every time.
2.0,Uncomfortable but works ok
2.0,"El vestido demasiado grande.  No tiene forma adem√°s no era la talla que hab√≠amos. Pedido. No se devolvi√≥, porque era para mi hija y ella no estaba para med√≠rselo"
2.0,"Much smaller than I expected. Doesn't seem to help at all. I feel if I had a better quality pair they might help but these only made me dizzy. I didn't get any prescription, they were intended to help with the computer glair and eye strain but it was not successful. The only reason they get a 2 is because they are very cute!"
2.0,"Cap is nice, but the logo is a cheap iron on transfer.  Very disappointed."
2.0,"The band worked great for a month and a half before it stared to break. Lasts the perfect amount of time for the return window to close. I have a desk job, so its not like I was to rough on it."
2.0,"Very thin material, too small."
2.0,The masks were adult size not kids
2.0,Size large too small and I'm not a big person.
2.0,My boyfriend had these for a day and a lens popped out if the frame. He never did anything crazy to cause the lens to pop out.
2.0,"I bought this tie clip for something that was clean with a little bit of style. This clip fit the bill for budget as well. BUUUUUTTTTT... the quality sucked. The tie clip in the picture does not share the same detail as the one I recieved. When this was etched, it appears that there was no concern to quality. The lines and texture drastically overshoot and therefore the tie clip does not look ""clean cut"" as I inteneded. I would return but it is not worth my time or money. Maybe sometime I'll wear it when I'm not concerned with looking good."
2.0,I really wanted to like this dress - but it was made of the weirdest material! The color was great but the material was somewhat rubbery. I would not purchase again.
2.0,"Its too small for the head of my girl, its so pretty but ill not use because of this problem."
2.0,"These socks are warm, but transfer color onto my feet. Not of quality and definitely shouldn't color my toes and feet."
2.0,very wrinkly and not very attractive. Thankfully it was a free return.
2.0,The material and shape of this item reminded of a tent. It really like I was wearing a tarp. Color was much lighter than photo. Product arrived extremely wrinkled. I returned it and we'll be buying a different brand.
2.0,"The picture of this shirt is nothing like what you get. There is no glitter/shine/sequins‚Äîjust stamped black image. However, my daughter still liked the feel of the fabric and was fine with the shirt, which is the only reason I gave this shirt 2 stars."
2.0,"Unfortunately, my high hopes for the nose bone were short lived.  The two sizes are not equal in length. The smaller size sinks dramatically into my piercing and has it red and irritated. I've had my nose pierced for almost 10-years, so this isn't a new piercing that needs to heal.The prongs on both are very rough, so expect it to get snagged. I am SUPER careful when I wash my face especially around the left nostril.  The large one snagged three different times over the first few days, pulling it out completely.  Hurt like the dickens.<br />It's an inexpensive, lower quality nose bone not well suited for professionals. It definitely looks like a cheap piece especially when it's in, no sparkle."
2.0,Thin and translucent
2.0,Like the idea of this dress but fabric is too silky for a summer dress. The pic of the dress appeared to have more of a fuller skirt and that was reality. I‚Äôd recommend sizing up for a more flowly look. I‚Äôm returning due to fabric.
2.0,It was not a good purchase: the garment had an overwhelming odor of cleaning fluid or other noxious liquid which if worn would cause headaches or worse; I sent it back.
2.0,"They were ok quality if you don‚Äôt mind looking like a circus clown. The blousing on the leggs were extreme for me. The fabric was a bit thin sorta because I‚Äôm in the Midwest. I should have checked out the label to see if they would pile after they were washed even if I turned them in side out. But the blousing made my skin crawl so I put them on my to go back chair. I always speak the truth. And if I have to go to the manufacturer of a brand I will. I think I have a reputation for returning to the group starting with a ‚ÄúC‚Äù. That‚Äôs fine if they are a E Commerce Group and take advantage of a old lady like me for losing a label or 2 and returning substandard night wear for my younger husband who is working in a hospital supporting the nursing staff and doctors up here. Well, fine I realize in this country MONEY TALKS. And I will go to the manufactures site or brick and mortar to make sure my husband has  quality night up here. This is a example of why I refused to do E-Commerce when I was approached 6 months ago. Just as I gave my FED-Ex customers first class service and gave them my personal cell number for 20 years. And yes they did call me. Even on the weekend and after I had been bit by neglected abused obese dogs. Or when I stepped into a flag pole hole that the home owners did not fill in which I could have sued them like I sued the home owner of the dog that bit me in the back of my left knee and got down to my truck and called a ambulance for myself. Of course I should point out this area is Naperville where Warren Buffet bought and tore down a family owned tree farm which had a very beautiful Buckeye tree growing there. Now it‚Äôs a million dollar homes there. Yes money talks all right. Yes I knew the owner and she‚Äôs gone and so is that beautiful tree. And now Jeff Bezos staff using the Dupage county area as a experiment or a breeding ground. Won‚Äôt you people google Mercy Ship or Cure Illinois and stop dumping cereals and canned food and processed. Try helping with fresh or frozen products at the West Suburban Food Pantry and other food pantry‚Äôs. I‚Äôm very FORTUNATE to have run to FEDEX and Fred Smiths staff has really taken care of us both. I realize probably because I was in the ARMY."
2.0,I've worn these socks on less than 10 runs and there's already a hole in the toe region on one sock.
2.0,Super cheap feeling. Returned.
2.0,I do like the fabric it‚Äôs very soft and tummy control is amazing! It didn‚Äôt roll down or anything. When I got them well as you see on the pictures it was already coming apart. I probably won‚Äôt buy them again due to the issues I had from buying them for the first time. It is true to its size that‚Äôs a plus!
2.0,"I love this jewelry it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous.<br />I pierced the daith and I put the opal piece in, and it‚Äôs turning green. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just my biology or the cleaner I‚Äôm using but I‚Äôm really upset about it. And now it‚Äôs getting sore."
2.0,I liked the product but the zipper was so cheap it broke after the first time I wore it.
2.0,You can see everything through this material....way too much.  Might make a good nightgown with a robe....pretty color just way too sheer
2.0,Vivid color but cheap after a few washes not useable.  I do NOT recommend this item.
2.0,"Super small, logo is faded."
2.0,"While the jacket fits in the arms/shoulders/chest, it is NOT possible to zip up the hoodie mask comfortably. It smashes against the wearers face and is extremely tight. In order to look out the mesh eye area, the wearer's nose is smashed down and the mesh mouth opening is nowhere near the wearer's mouth. Both of these things make it difficult to breathe, which is a hazard.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend this jacket."
2.0,Poor quality cotton. ITCHY
2.0,"The plastic rose broke just from pulling it out of the plastic packaging, also the plastic was dirty and looked grimy. This looked very cheap and I was disappointed with the quality, I know it was less than $2 but i never even got to wear it"
2.0,After three months of normal use the rose gold  color coating has gone and the watche is not nice and I can't wear it.<br /><br />I was not expecting such a defect on a Burberry watch !!!
2.0,I didn't like the back straps or the lite compression.
2.0,"These shorts are well made and have a full lining which I liked, but they were very bunchy and unflattering in the crotch area."
2.0,Don't like it!
2.0,These just didn't work for us.  I like the concept but these seemed like they were cutting the circulation off on my babies legs and she's not a very big baby.  Like she's kinda on the smaller/skinnier side.
2.0,I liked the print but it's fairly transparent so you'll definitely want to wear a slip with it. It would definitely qualify as a summer dress. Unfortunately it's super small. It must be an Asian Large as opposed to a regular large so adjust accordingly before you purchase.
2.0,Fit better as cartilage piercing than septum. Super small
2.0,This mask is OK however I wish it was slightly larger as it doesn't quite cover my face as I hoped it would.
2.0,Don‚Äôt let the picture fool you it is made of polyester spandex whatever I thought it would be more of a cotton type dress and it‚Äôs more something my grandmother wore in the late 70s very ugly
2.0,The fit was too big and it didn't look like the picture honestly. I sent it back after trying it on. I was disappointed because it was so cute. But didn't work for me.
2.0,"The bow tie is wine color, the hat is orangey and the suspenders are red. The hat is really crushed. Very disappointed but will make it work."
2.0,"Too short, tight on the chest, doesn‚Äôt have the cut in the back like shown in the picture, and it‚Äôs just too small. The only good thing is the graphic. If you‚Äôre short and stalky, I guess it would work for you. I even went up a size."
2.0,Pattern is great but the sweater is more like a long sleeve shirt with a hood. It is super thin!
2.0,"Don't like it, one of my worst purchase"
2.0,"This fit was kind of sack like on me. I have broad shoulders, a large bust, and slightly narrow hips. The bows on the shoulders are not nearly as delicate as what the picture depicts on the model. The waist didn't sinch in quite as nicely either. I had a hard time finding measurements that worked best for my build. I think this might look good on someone just not me."
2.0,The dress was too long and the material was not as expected.
2.0,"I was very disappointed in this item. When this was purchased, I believed this item to be a thick hoodie type pullover. What I got was a thin, cheaply made item no thicker than a windbreaker. Since this was bought for a gift there wasn't time to return and get my money back or exchange."
2.0,"I loved the material on this<br /><br />Unfortunately it is so loosely woven that you can see SKIN through it. I personally want my sweater to give me full coverage so I‚Äôll need to return.<br /><br />Very disappointed.<br /><br />If you don‚Äôt care about that, it‚Äôs very soft and cozy.<br />Sizing: small would have worked for me."
2.0,"Nice-looking, nice weight, nice feel, but it fell apart the 3rd day I used it."
2.0,"Good clarity, not happy with the design and how high they sit off the face at the bottom of the lens."
2.0,We have had this product less than a month and the plastic piece that holds the band in place already broke. We take good care of our purchases and therefore can only tribute it to lack of quality even thought the band is good. It looks unprofessional with the strap dangling
2.0,"I saw there on sale and just HAD to have them. Fortunately they still had my size. I don't know if it's because I had foot surgery, but left slipper was so large it just wouldn't stay on. Foot kept slipping to the left, and off the base. I would not buy these again. Very disappointing because I love Betsey Johnson."
2.0,Only received the gold and black ring
2.0,It broke after wearing twice.  I loved it but was sad that it broke.
2.0,The right slipper is too small.  The surface of the slippers are rough and uncomfortable.
2.0,"So I‚Äôm kinda confused...I ordered this dress in 2 colors, same size (S) and one is way too long and the other is too short? The material is kind of this weird satiny cheap fabric. Doesn‚Äôt look horrible in the blue cuz the dark color kind of hides it, but the brown has a really shiny look to it. I actually like the blue one but it is way too long! I would be tripping over it all the time. Also, the blue one came with a hole in one of the pockets :(<br />Will be returning both.<br /><br />For reference, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù 140 lbs."
2.0,"These are a little loose fit if you have a longer face, the straps to help tighten them just lead to irritation around your ears and unneeded pressure. Absolutely great if only going to be worn for 1-2 hours.<br /><br />However, I work in food service and need to have my mask on all day while talking to customers, and this product just continues to fall and bunch up."
2.0,"They show, at the very least up to the date of this review, a shape that is like their rounder fuller models which is what I had thought I was buying.  WRONG... they are the (very) old school tear drop shape which looks too narrow to look real or natural for a CD and thus why they came out with the rounfwr model.<br /><br />So for me.... This looks like, feels like and smells loke a bait and switch.... Right up until they chsmge the photo.<br /><br />I have had nothing but problems when buying from envy and much in line with all experiences bad with envy, I had a small accident and a tiny drip of super glue got on one of the forms and immediately made them non returnable... Believe me, they are near impossible to get returns"
2.0,"I really wanted to like this one.  Unfortunately, I could barely get it over my head.  I did not want to force it, so I got my wife to help and she observed that the split in the back was already split way up into the brain area and I was not even in the mask  yet.  I do have other vinyl masks and I do have another fully enclosed mask with the shoulders which fit with no problem, but this mask was just not large enough.  Once I had it on, with her help, it was very uncomfortable, as it fit my head very tight.  When we got it on to where the eye holes lined up with my eyes, nothing else lined up so my nose was mashed and the mouth hole was over my chin.  This really did not seem to be sized for an adult.  Maybe if you are an adult who wears a hat size that is on the smaller side it might work for you, but if you wear larger hats, this mask is not likely to fit you.<br /><br />My son tried it on and it did go on him easier than it did on me.  He was very uncomfortable in it and said he could not breathe in it.  I noticed that the mouth opening did not line up with his mouth either.  The mouth opening is quite large and has a couple of elastic straps on the sides.  It looked crooked and will not close.  I think the idea was probably to have a mouth that opens and shuts when you talk, but what it really looked like, was a crooked open hole over your chin.<br /><br />If it had fit, I do like the looks of the mask, but at this point It will be relegated to being on a mannequin for the next haunted trail (if I can fit it on one) and the back of the mask is torn too much to use it in any way that shows the back of the head.<br /><br />If it fits you, great, but I have worn a lot of masks, and I have never had this much trouble getting into one."
2.0,These are very cute- but extremely large and more like a lapel pin than earrings.
2.0,"Looks cheap didn't  even take out of package but easy return and speedy delivery. Maybe it could work out for someone else, but looked also old fashioned in my opinion and I'm 40yrs old"
2.0,"It‚Äôs cute and comfy at first...a little smaller than expected but still fine. After wearing it for a while, I fall out the bottom. It‚Äôs not supportive enough. The bottom elastic isn‚Äôt strong. I‚Äôm a 34D."
2.0,"The dress looks similar to the picture displaces except (1) it is pretty thin, sheer material, more like a nightie and (2) it can be very hard to tell it‚Äôs a butterfly on the dress because where the pic sits on the dress it gets hidden by the folds of the dress and doesn‚Äôt show unless you‚Äôre spinning or holding it out like it shows in the pictures online.<br /><br />The dress was a fairly tight fit up top, especially in the arms and my girl has zero body fat so I have a feeling this would be too tight on many kids.<br /><br />The dress was also slightly too long.  I got her a size 4 and she‚Äôs of normal height and in a size 4 almost a 5 and it still slightly drags on the floor on the sides where the lengthy parts of the dress are.  I guess i should have realized how long it would be.  When you‚Äôre spinning like the girl in their picture it stays off the floor but even for her it is probably on the ground when she‚Äôs standing still.<br /><br />I guess this is a good example of you get what you pay for.  Unfortunately my daughter likes her dresses ‚Äúlong like princess Elsa‚Äù (hence why I bought this) so, because this is the longest dress my kid owns, it is also her favorite.  I‚Äôm hoping she loses it soon."
2.0,The cost of these shirts is way too high for the quality period
2.0,Chain is very thin for the pendant. Chain seperated from the clasp within the first week.
2.0,"The 'tube top' portion of the dress is nothing like the picture.  The picture shows a model wearing a dress that has the top going down to the waistline.  The dress I received had a top section that will not go beyond mid bust-line and it just was not what I expected.  It's not a bad dress, it's just not what I  wanted for this occasion."
2.0,"I bought two of these because it‚Äôs so cute but they shrink up upon first wash, mostly unwearable again. AND I AIR DRY. Sheer, so I‚Äôve been most comfortable wearing these as a bathing suit cover up rather than actual clothes."
2.0,"Nothing special about these shorts.<br />I avoided returning them, keeping these as my spare, but, I very often wonder why.<br />First off, the chamois makes you look like you just took a dump in your shorts (my OpenRoad ones do not!).<br />Secondly, the waistband of the shorts comes up to about mid-chest, which is simply ridiculous. If I wanted a bib, I would've gotten a bib.<br /><br />Not a good pare of shorts. Keep it for those times when your main pair is in the wash."
2.0,Didn't like how it looked washed out after the first washing. I washed it in cold water and dried on low.
2.0,very pretty but not for iphone7
2.0,Runs extremely small and length is very short. I ordered an XL as it mentioned it ran small so it was recommended to size up. XL was still very small
2.0,"This is an amazing looking item, yet it arrived with a terrible toxic fume!<br /><br />I had purchased it as a gag Christmas gift, and was looking forward to forcing my husband to wear it for the superbowl. HOwever, the joke was on me, once my husband unwrapped the present, the smell was so strong, it made me tear up from toxic fumes. Unfortunately we needed to return it immediately.  If only the smell was not so toxic, we would be wearing these ridiciously looking hats on superbowl sunday."
2.0,"So pretty but not practical, didn't look good on and my were missing some stones."
2.0,great vent only down side is that all three blades on the vent started sliding off and hitting the screen making an awful noise
2.0,size inaccurate
2.0,"I was shocked when I firstly found these on Amazon because I bought them before, and they were super expensive ($7-8 for just 1 piece, etc) but it says 5 pieces here just for 15 bucks. Then when I got it I realize they are fake. The details are so bad compare to the real ones... I guess I wouldn‚Äôt be so upset if I have never see the real ones, which are so beautiful and every detail was delicate.<br />Also after a while I still opened it and try to use it and realized it was super hard to get rid of the white stains. I still can‚Äôt get rid of it."
2.0,This sweater does not hang well at all.  On the thin side.  Would not recommend.
2.0,If you like stitch the design is cute. The material is light which is ok but it is so hard to adjust. I wouldn't recommend if you need to adjust frequently like me.
2.0,"You really have to have a perfect body, or really love body con. The fabric is unforgiving and was not at all flattering."
2.0,"This was not the light weight flowy skirt I had expected. The underneath fabric and tulle (not chiffon) are heavy, and the waistband just makes the fabric poof out unattractively. Not lovely."
2.0,This necklace is great if you are 8 or 9 but my cat lover teenager thought the medallion was too big to be tasteful. The necklace was returned.
2.0,"Doesn't look like pictures advertised. Like buying  fast food getting garbage in return.<br />Not long and sleek, it's square"
2.0,They looked somewhat real but they bothered my lip and they were pinching bad and i got a rash
2.0,It is really baggy in the front like a over sized hoodie
2.0,Size smaller than expected for plus size.
2.0,"This shoe is impractically stiff and runs almost a full size smaller than the regular ghost; the toe box is also more narrow.  I bought it because I like the color scheme; Brooks colors are uninspiring.  If you can handle a stiff shoe, then order a size larger than you might for the regular roast."
2.0,About 3 out of the 8 came like this. So I've been afraid to wear them. The others are fine. The ones I've worn are starting to change colors already.. you get what you pay for!
2.0,"These are very colorful straps.  I purchased several, so I really do like them.  However, they are listed as ones that float.  They do not float."
2.0,"Just received and they are going back Tommorow. Nice idea,trendy,close to description, but INCREADABLE cheaply made.Cheap,cheap,cheap.<br />2* for the great design and idea."
2.0,The snaps on these are not very good-- one actually fell apart and the one side of the snap came out of the choker altogether.
2.0,"Bought these since it was a good price. Normally I can wear a 38DD (as most stores don't carry anything larger unless you want to pay $50) but I got these in 38DDD hoping for a better cup fit since I usually have to squeeze my boobs in those cups and hope they stay put. But sizing on these seems way off, both cup sizing and around are off. Cups are way too small, I'm spilling out and and only about 2/3rds of my boob fit in the cups and then its loose around even on the tightest clasp. And there is some extra wires in there on the side(not the underwire) that will bend and poke you too. Only nice thing to say is they look nice."
2.0,Belts look like they are made for a kid?!..
2.0,"This product is not what you think it will be. I did a water test when I first purchased it and it passed. I put the coat on and had my friend pour water on my arm and it rolled up into little beads of water and and truly repelled from the jacket. She poured it over my head and it work too. I was not wet. HOWEVER, after washing it the water repellent material no longer worked. I got caught in the rain and I got soaked. It was a waste of money. It‚Äôs like when i washed it I washed the water repellent seal away. It doesn‚Äôt keep you warm in any way shape or form at all.  It is very thin. I feel like i wasted my money."
2.0,I like these lenses a lot. They snapped in perfect. Since they were so cheap I ordered the nose piece and ear socks. I have found that when you get aftermarket lenses it's better to order their brand nose piece for the best fit. I looked on YouTubu to see any reviews. Really the only relevant review was an Australian man said the lenses have a distortion when looking through them. I cannot see a distortion at all. Visually they are perfect. I have no complaints with these lenses and would order again.<br /><br />Update!<br />It's now May and I bought the lenses in February and the coating on the front of the lenses is coming off. No extreme usage or abuse. Just general wear day to day and this is now happening.  I hope something is done because if not I will not buy them again!
2.0,Too hot against skin
2.0,"Difficult to open, (Disposable Gloved-to began usage), Material Substance Uncomfortable"
2.0,I don‚Äôt like the print one bit. But it‚Äôs very comfy.
2.0,"I bought a small which was too small, so I bought a medium and it was too large."
2.0,weak elastic
2.0,Not waterPROOF.
2.0,THIS IS NOT A SWEATER THIS CHEAP SWEATER MATERIAL NOT AT WHAT THEY DESCRIBE JUST A LONG CHEAP T SHIRT
2.0,Cute earrings but they broke after day 2.
2.0,I liked it a lot. Very pretty. Broken within a week. You could see around the hand and the balls that it was eventually going to come loose. I just didn't expect it to be that easy.
2.0,"The buttons I received were not good in color. About 3 were cracked. I do not know if this was at the end of the painting line or what, but the yellow looks to be more like lime yellow.The pink was a real light pink. It would be nice if I got more evenly colored buttons. I think I would just wait and buy them so I could see the finished product myself. I was refunded $1.00 for the 3 cracked buttons. I wasn't happy for these were going to be made into crocheted button flowers for the seniors."
2.0,The earrings do not close. Constantly falling out. The closure is Flimsy. I do not want to try to force them close for fear they will bend or worse just break.
2.0,"I bought this for my daughter as a birthday present but it only lasted 2 weeks in one piece. The stitching on this hat is terrible. The air bladder that makes the ponytail go up and down fell right out in my daughters hand prompting hysterics from my little girl. Contrary to what some of you might think, no she was not pulling on it. She was just squeezing it as per normal use. I would not recommend this hat."
2.0,The actual product look already stretched out and out of shape.  And material didn't feel nice at all.  Returned this item.
2.0,Runs large. Faded black material.  Looks old.
2.0,Would never buy another one turns my fiance's arm green... would not recommend purchase
2.0,"Hips small, waist big and very high..."
2.0,"I used this tote to store my medicine. After 2-3 weeks of use, the handle pulled away from the body. The tote isn't even holding 5 pounds!"
2.0,[[VIDEOID:942a4438405a1737f67c9a9ece488bba]] Very sloppy and small.
2.0,Said preshrunk  shrunk in dryer sits below waist my as avdvertised
2.0,Leather began to show through after a few usage to the gray below
2.0,"I have many Vionic shoes, I love them, so I was expecting the same perfect fit from the same size.  They were very tight on my feet.  Cute and light though, but I had to return."
2.0,I returned it because there was a large white mark on the back on one of the ears.
2.0,"Very tiny, also extremely hard to connect once they are in your ears and then slip out all the time.  Lost and found one three times in one day.  Finally lost it.  Not worth it."
2.0,"These were very heavy and hard to breathe through. They would move in with every intake of air. The nose strip, if you wore glasses, only really worked with larger glasses not small rectangular ones. They were sewn together very well and washed very well."
2.0,"I was disappointed at how poorly made the dress was. If I were to keep the dress, I would have removed the belt loops and belt and replaced the them with a higher quality fabric. The hem of the dress was surged such that I would have had to do some hand sewing on it to make it workable. I ordered another dress in the same size and this one was much larger. This dress had a soft tulle lining which gives the dress a little fullness, which was nice. Also, this dress would be a full twirly dress which little girls seem to like."
2.0,"If you dig a hole with the clae hand, then you have to take the glove off to handle the seedling.  The hard plastic claws make it impossible to use the claw hand for anything else."
2.0,Too many wrinkles
2.0,"Look at the size chart. I did that and got the right size, but when I tried it on it felt too bulky and made me look heavier. It's just not for me. Lots of people love this shirt, and the quality seemed fine, just don't buy it thinking it will be a thinner plaid."
2.0,"Cheaply made, drapes weird and is kind of uncomfortable."
2.0,"These are pretty, but very cheap materials."
2.0,The connector was hard to removed the links. I did not like it. I returned it
2.0,The color is good on it.<br />but its See throug.
2.0,The pattern is great but really small for me...prob should have paid closer attention to measurements...I wanted it loose and it is not on me...
2.0,"Too yellow, looks cheap."
2.0,Like the look but not big enough.
2.0,The armpit area is tight for me. Didn‚Äôt notice until later that the fur is held on by buttons and makes it look ugly. I wish I had returned it.
2.0,"A vest, a tie, a bow tie and a hankie for under $20 .... Should have known it would not be the quality we were looking for. However, if you need a vest for a single occasion and don't mind rather stiff fabric this is an incredible deal.  We however were looking for a vest which will be worn a lot so it won't work for my hubby.  Delivery was prompt."
2.0,Was def not true to size.
2.0,"The material is very cheap feeling. The fit is fine, however, the top looks as if I purchased from a second hand store. The black color appears faded, the buttons look cheap, and the collar is not as high as pictured in the photo.  I would totally return this, but I am so annoyed and disappointed, I plan to just throw away. I would have done better to get this from a flee market."
2.0,The item too large
2.0,"I would like it if it looked like the picture, but the picture was obviously enlarged.  The chain itself is very skimpy and the clasp is very small.  I am sending it back for a refund."
2.0,Order half a size up toes are very tight
2.0,"Shoes fit and looks great, after wearing them four times, they are already coming apart.  Not good!"
2.0,didnt fit as expected and wasnt really true to the design
2.0,"Be vigilant if you select the &#34;Red&#34; picture in the 2nd row (looks like dark, brick red).  When I did, &#34;Burgundy/blk&#34; was put into my cart and I got a color that my son didn't want. (I pretended to start a new order and the same thing happened).  The seller is offering me a refund, but now I don't have the present under the tree that I wanted to give to my son."
2.0,Trapped water and made my arm break out in a rash.
2.0,Strap broke and zipper snagged after a month
2.0,"I was disappointed with this sports bra.  I was very shocked by some of the reviews, too.  I am large chested and got a L.  The front zipper is super bulky.  It cannot be disguised under shirts.  I just didn't like the seams on the front either, they were visible in shirts.  The front zipper actually caught my skin.  I would expect a fuller back for a larger chest to support.  I did like the neck part, I felt it had good support, but I would never wear this bra to jog or workout.  I was bouncing way too much in this, it would be embarrassing and I think not supportive for breasts' delicate skin that shouldn't jostle like that in workouts.  I have been searching for the best sports bra for years and I still haven't found it.<br /><br />I received this at a discount for an honest review."
2.0,A little disappointed they should change the wording a set mean you get two and I only received one which messed up everything I wanted to do. I refused alot of things because you pay for one but was very excited to see a set of cartilage earrings to find out after it is bought and delivered you only get one
2.0,Cheap loud material- skip this purchase.  100% polyester
2.0,"returned as the description said it was a faux suede skirt, but it wasn't faux suede at all. I have 3 other faux suede skirts and this was more like basic cotton"
2.0,did not like the fabric
2.0,They are really cheap. Fell apart when I took them out of the bag but I guess that‚Äôs to be expected for the price.
2.0,"This product was much much smaller than expected based on the dimensions provided and much smaller than two prior carry-on's my wife and I own. This bag would only be suitable for 3-4 night trip. In my opinion a rolling suitcase this small makes no sense. For the amount of clothes that will fit in this I would prefer to just pack a backpack or small duffel bag.<br /><br />The depth is closer to 7.5 inches than 9 inches - maybe the 9 is the fully expanded size. Furthermore, about 1-2 inches of the depth is taken up by a very bulky plastic structure surrounding the handle. . The internal length was also considerably less than 22 inches - 22 inches must include the wheel and handle.<br /><br />I returned this product for the 25 inch expandable."
2.0,This &#34;sweater&#34; fit as expected but I noticed a few holes/tears in the seams as I was wearing it.
2.0,"I really wanted to wear this dress for my wedding, but it was cut very small and I even sized up several sizes to compensate for the history of ordering from sites that run small. I was so disappointed."
2.0,"The ratchet mechanism on the buckle is not at all reliable. I move around quite a bit at work, and I stopped wearing the belt due to the frequency with which it would come undone at inopportune times. There would be days where it would stay in place well enough, and there would be days where I was constantly having to re-secure the belt. Not ideal. It's a sharp looking belt, especially for the price, but I would look elsewhere."
2.0,"It is cute, but the XL is a Medium in real life, not worth returning for 12.00 just going to give it to someone."
2.0,"It does the job if you're looking for an everyday cheap stud. It's nice that they come with multiple since I'm prone to losing them. The different colors are nice.<br />However, they move around A BUNCH. Working in the healthcare field, I often get embarassed because the inside part is poking out and looks like a booger. I've had many different types of studs, and these move around much more than others.<br />The stud is pretty small flat and thin, so the stud settles really low in my nose and has made my piercing hole have a weird shape to it. This didn't happen with my previous studs, which had a thicker stud base.<br />I can't be mad about it though, because they were uber cheap. So you get what you pay for.<br />If I were to do this again, I probably would have gotten a different set for a few more bucks to avoid the hassle of constantly readjusting them in my nose."
2.0,Does not stay open on the first try.  Little small too.
2.0,It was a nice beanie but wasn't what I was looking for so I sent it back. It didn't quite cover my ears like I wanted.
2.0,This was 3 sizes smaller than what I thought it was suppose to be.  Instead of sending it back I gave it to my coworker and she loves it.
2.0,The shirt I received did not look like this. The print is black on a dark gray tshirt so you can‚Äôt even read it and the letters look like they are ready to peel off. The girl isn‚Äôt even the same she doesn‚Äôt even have an apple on her arm.  I was pretty disappointed when I received it. I ordered a small and it is more like a size medium it is very big. Over all not a good purchase.
2.0,way to tight fits like a medium and i needed an XL
2.0,Nice pants but it still runs too small.  I wear a US large and got a US X-Large.  It was still too small.  I could have used an XX - Large
2.0,"Super cute and of good quality, but far too small for a full size adult. I gave it to my 6 year old niece, fits her pefectly."
2.0,"I must return this.  The size tag is on the OUTSIDE of the skirt.  Like....a clear tag that says &quot;L&quot; ON THE OUTSIDE of the skirt.  If I walked around in this, people would KNOW i wore a Large. Also, the dress comes with an inner lining that goes past the skirt hem.  The slip would always show. It looks sloppy."
2.0,The pendant was pretty but the whole item looked very cheap. The necklace was not long by any stretch. It was already chipping by the time I got it. It could have been a very nice piece but seemed to be very poor quality.
2.0,If The product is not what you expect and you have to return it be aware that they did not refund all the money.
2.0,"Decent material, nice design, but it is definitely for short torsos.  I gave this one to my daughter."
2.0,"Super small, thin... toy-ish.  Not at all what I was looking for."
2.0,"The fabric does not give any compression, and was definitely see through."
2.0,I wouldn't recommend. This fox outfit was way bigger than expected. Also the quality was so poor that the tag was sewn on the outside of the outfit and the fabric was picked all over.
2.0,Returned... very cheap looking and tangled when it arrived.
2.0,The size listed is EXTREMELY SMALLER than listed couldn't even get it around me and I think Chinas sizes are made to chinese womens sizes that are built much shorter and smaller framed than US women. We have taller parents and larger frames. Even if I ordered the next size larger it was like 5 inches around far too small!
2.0,Zipper doesn't stay fastened. Pinches
2.0,Nice Quality. But looks very yellow. Not gold like in the picture.
2.0,There needs to be a size comparison on bedroom slippers. I got a med. Of one style and it was very small. I ordered a large on another style and it was huge<br />No one knows what size is what.
2.0,"Nice size and shape for a 5-8 yr old, however the painted on soft rubber-ish colour came off after 3 weeks of moderate wear. Pieces around the ears left blue residue around my son's ears! Cheaply made! Don't waste your money!"
2.0,Cheaply made if you ask me! Top fits perfect bottoms are definitely not for women with butt or hips highly disappointed should‚Äôve listened to the reviews waste of my money
2.0,"I bought three of these dresses for a wedding in May. Size 6, 4, and 2. The size 6 is beautiful and perfect. It it made out of a thicker cotton material. The size 4 and 2 are disappointing! The material is different - a silky, stretchy material that shows through every little bone and bump on their chests and bellies. I don‚Äôt know why they aren‚Äôt all the same material and hope I hear from the seller and am able to get the smaller ones in the same material as the size 6. If it had been the same, these dresses would have gotten 5 stars!<br />I will have to return and find something else. The description does say cotton material."
2.0,"Runs small, and is thin."
2.0,I ordered an xl expecting it to fit small. An xl equals a small in regular clothes. I'm 5 2&#34; 115 and the xl fit there wasn't too much room like in the picture
2.0,Snap does not stay closed - don't like that my cards are on this side.  Also don't like that there is no where to put change.
2.0,"Sizing is off and I even ordered larger than I needed and had to return for too small. There was a slight odor to the shirt, perhaps from the screen printing."
2.0,I love thorlos sock for running but I ordered the low cut and received the mini. They are much lower cut than the picture. Kinda disappointed in the inaccurate description
2.0,I don't like the quality or the fit. It's bigger than a usual Large
2.0,I waited 3 weeks for these glasses to come and when they finally arrived the tint is darker on one the lenses than the other. I guess since they were so cheap I wont complain too much but its sad I wasted money on glasses I cant wear
2.0,"Just so people are aware, these are chinese knockoffs of a set of Nike running shorts and have next to no breathability. After running 10K my thighs and inner bits were drowning in a pool of sweat."
2.0,"I like it because it keep me warm and comfortable, but the top too big and folding when walking"
2.0,"This tankini is well made and beautiful, however, not for bigger busted women."
2.0,"Could not fit this damn thing in my ear, which makes me sad. I wish it unscrewed in the middle."
2.0,Material and stitching was poor quality<br />Get what you pay for I guess
2.0,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd go through the return process for $7, but really not my favorite. Too small, fabric is too cheap, tags/labels were missing. Poor quality."
2.0,"it's small, tight and sheer.  Does not look like the picture.  Colors aren't as vibrant and while I bought it as a gift, I didn't give it as it didn't seem as nice.  It's not bad, but I didn't feel it nice enough to give as a gift."
2.0,wasn‚Äôt bad just didnt fit me as expected. very loose over the stomach
2.0,I did not like the way this fit.
2.0,"I was very disappointed, I wouldn't have paid $3 for this had I seen it in person.  I loved the design but the material is not soft, but shiny and doesn't look good in person, I ordered a smallish size because I wanted a closer fit.  It's not huge on me, but it's pretty large, the armholes go halfway down my sides, and considering I ordered a smaller size, it's pretty large.  The length is not quite but almost getting toward a short dress."
2.0,"I just received this today after waiting weeks for it to arrive. It's just another cheap product ""made in china"" In theory, it's a cool looking bracelet, but as I removed it from the plastic bag, the hook/clasp broke right off. The cheap glue gave out. I paid more in shipping than I did for the actual bracelet, so there's no point in returning it. I would just warn you to think twice before ordering. I just wasted $9."
2.0,"Cute earrings, but too heavy for me to wear for very long."
2.0,I like the material its soft and breathable. I ordered xl and item is runs small
2.0,I ordered an extra large this dress does not fit true to size I had to send it back.
2.0,Wear a small to medium us size...ordered a large to be sure it fit...it came and was much much much too small.  can't wear. Even their xl will not fix based on this one here...they must be very little people
2.0,Pin break easy why try put on shirt
2.0,Super cute but giraffe ossicones break of really easy. My daughter loved them but was devastated when the ossicones broke
2.0,I ordered a xxl but the size was more like a large. Not made of sweatshirt material. It was more like a knit shirt. Very disappointed and had to send it back after giving it as a gift.
2.0,"I was really excited when I found these Earring Studs, the stainless steel with a flat back and beautiful multichrome color was everything I had been looking for.  Unfortunately, the post isn't long enough and doesn't reach all the way through my ears so i am unable to use them.  All the posts are the same size too, just the guage is differently sized."
2.0,This product didn't appear exactly as in the picture on Amazon.<br />The picture showed it brighter and on the visual look here it's not as it appears in the picture.
2.0,"I got this in black and white thinking that it would have a kind of vintage look. But it really just makes me look like a Gothic milkmaid. I'm 5'1"" and it's far too long. I feel like if it ended around the mid-calf that would have been a better fit. It's well constructed and would probably be a good fit for someone else. But it's a fairly thick linen-like material and would require extensive Ironing and maintenance. It just wasn't for me!"
2.0,Product description does not provide a size chart. On choices are S-XL.  So I had to guess and chose the wrong size. Now I stuck with a belt that's too big.
2.0,"I really wanted to like this and it looks just like the picture and is silky and feels great, BUT it is not as long as it is shown in the picture. It looks more like a top instead of a dress..the back covers ny butt barely and the front comes up to the top of my hips so you can see my vagina. Other than that, it is really pretty, just too small for me..maybe better on shorter girls. I am 5'7""...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
2.0,"Not as expected. Was too soft, no shape."
2.0,It seems like the separates don't match. The pants can be too tight while the jacket it huge!
2.0,The outfit is great and fits great only thing Is I bought the outfit because I thought the sleeves were super cute. But beware they are not as puffy and full looking like in the pic but overall ok.
2.0,The dress fits well as expected but it‚Äôs very itchy and sheer. Would definitely need to wear a slip underneath.
2.0,"These were ok. They could have been made of a better, more sturdy rope but they were also very affordable. Being adjustable is a plus."
2.0,"I got a medium the torso fits fine the arm holes were tiny so I cut the sleeve off, it fits fine now!"
2.0,it started to fall apart within an hour of wearing it. But it still is very pretty .
2.0,Very cheap Velcro band. Not sure it will stay on!
2.0,"Yes, it fits right in terms of size, BUT the fabric is so cheap, and it's not very well-cut. Sleeves are very uncomfortable"
2.0,Big bling watch. If they made them a bit smaller it would be nice. Non of the other item are working/ fake. The price is like what its worth.
2.0,My coat still fits over
2.0,"I really wanted to love this bag and I kinda do. However, the zippers are cheaply made.  The main zipper glider has broken within the first week. All the other zippers are just hard and don't glide well at all. Getting in and out of my purse is a hastle and a struggle.<br />***<br />Changing my review this bag is so cute, but I have lost two more sippers since and an inner hole in one of the pockets. This is the worst and I so wanted this bag"
2.0,They didn't fit as expected.
2.0,I ordered a larger size so it would be loose fitting and it fit like a much smaller size.
2.0,"WAY too small! I'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs, and I ordered a large (I usually wear mediums). I could barely get these over my thighs! They were itty bitty. I'm sure I would like them if they fit, they were super cute but just incorrectly sized. Size way up if you're buying!"
2.0,"It is EXTREMELY misleading to call these cotton. Because of the ‚Äúwaterproofing‚Äù feature, these felt more like reusable outdoor tablecloths. I‚Äôm sure that they used cotton on parts of this, but after reading the description, I was expecting the feel and fit of a cotton apron, and that is not at all what I received."
2.0,"The shirt itself is very thin. It has a small layer underneath, but you could see my white bra under it. Also, I am a plus size female. I wear a size 14 and thought 3XL would make it baggier. I tend to not wear super tight clothing. Shirt arrived very very small. For being a 3XL, I thought it would be a bit larger."
2.0,"Ordered this yesterday for my son for Halloween. Received it today and it is black, not gold. He‚Äôs so disappointed!"
2.0,"Fabric is nice, design has good print but IT WONT STAY ON! keeps rolling down because there is no seam to keep it on ...can't really wear it."
2.0,"It's ok. Not what I was expecting but it does the job, use it for the gym and work"
2.0,This shoes was so pretty. But so hard to walk on.
2.0,The material is very thick and cheap.
2.0,"What I liked: I loved the way this dress looked in the picture (I ordered the apricot). The colors are beautiful and it looked like it would have a cute fit. I got it quickly and the colors looked exactly as they did in the picture.<br /><br />What I didn't like: I ordered a small. To give you an idea of my measurements I'm 5'3&#34; and wear small/medium shirts, average C-cup, and size 6 pants. I would have ordered an extra small based on the other reviews (mainly saying that it was too large), but small was the smallest size they offer. My biggest complaint is the chest section of the dress. It was so large. I don't consider myself to be small-chested so I was surprised that there was so much extra space. It looked silly on me. The bodice was fairly fitted, although I would have liked something that was a bit more fitted because I could still pinch the fabric to pull it in more.<br /><br />Other things to note: The dress went down to my mid-calf. As a shorter person, I find that dresses that hit in the mid-calf sometimes make me look shorter. I personally would have liked something a tiny bit shorter, but I realize this may also be a part of the style of the dress.<br /><br />I ended up returning the dress. From the pictures online and even seeing it in person, it is a cute design/pattern, but the chest measurements seemed so off that I couldn't imagine myself actually wearing it out. I thought about possibly getting it taken in, but it didn't seem worth it based on the price of the dress.<br /><br />If you do have a fuller chest (perhaps a D cup), it may fit perfectly, but otherwise, I don't know if I'd recommend it to smaller chested ladies."
2.0,Dress very clingy
2.0,I wanted to love it. I washed it once. The black faded. Washed it on cold not hot and air dried. Disappointing. The quality isn‚Äôt the best.
2.0,"Is very cute, but the size is for a kid"
2.0,"This blousy is so beautiful, but runs small. I ordered a large (just to be on the safe side) normally I wear a medium size and it was still too tight on me. I'm 5&#34;4, 155lb. I would recommend ordering 2 size more than what you normally are."
2.0,I'm sorely disappointed in this product. The comfort is why I have it two stars but the missing three are from failure to hold together. Seamsmcame undone after the first and only wash. Wore it twice. Was hoping for better quality.
2.0,This top is very cute and the color is accurate. The material however is very thick and really weighs down the top. The straps fit a bit awkwardly too.
2.0,"Ordered these a couple of times in attempt to find one that worked as the baby size (which had been great) no longer fit. One pair was broken at the arm attachment, the replacement pair was ridiculously warped. Returned both and will be trying a different brand for toddler sunglasses."
2.0,"Had glue and sticky strips inside the bottoms of dress, and the one shoulder is a little low for me.  But I am a full firgure women, so you can see top of my breast.  But the glue and sticky part is the deal breaker."
2.0,These are Not bell bottoms. Not denim material.<br />Very dissatisfied with this purchase
2.0,To small and two of the pairs had large holes
2.0,Decent quality but fails to show how harness lays across back. Not flat and causes a twisted strap across your back. Returning
2.0,Quality lacks a bit in the sewing. String came apart on one pair first trying to put them on.
2.0,"love the dress as a night gown, but it is so small. I ordered the size I wear in everything and it was tiny. I would order a size or 2 larger if you plan to wear it in public. it didnt even work as a swim suit cover up for me. I ordered a small, I am 5' 9&#34; and 130 size 4 or 26 waist with D boobs."
2.0,"Not useful, but this could be very subjective."
2.0,It was a gift and she ended up giving it to her daugther.
2.0,The dress is beautiful and the material is good quality.  I bought a size larger than my normal and still way to small.  I have amazon prime so a little spoiled being able to get a product within a 10day period.  The dress also came with a $27 dollar shipping fee (standard delivery).  I would not have bought this dress if not asked to by the bride of the wedding I will be in.
2.0,Se rompi√≥ casi de inmediato. Muy lindo pero no se calidad.
2.0,Cute but much shorter top than the picture.
2.0,"Cute tap. But gets tight at the hip, which is not a stretchy fabric.  Doesn‚Äôt offer much stretch at the hip."
2.0,Not the right size the plugs are not cut the same they fall out super easily
2.0,"These are very pretty, but I am not sure this is really sterling silver because the back of the earrings (the part that goes in the pierced hole of the ear) bends and (I am sure) it will eventually break off the earring very soon.  I have to work to keep it intact.  I just hope it doesn't break off while I am wearing it."
2.0,Horrible sewing job! Not impressed. Skirt fabric is thin and needs 2 slips for modesty. Disappointed with craftsmanship.
2.0,"The horns are the incorrect direction for them to be Sylvie‚Äôs horns. The material and back strap are great, but I ended up cutting the big horn off, turning it roughly 90¬∞, and then super gluing it back on. The broken one I cut off, cut in half, and then super glued it back on for it to look more realistic."
2.0,"This review is for the Conmite Men's Fashion Quarter Zip Pullover Turtleneck Knitted Sweater Slim Fit Wine Red. The Conmite Men‚Äôs Fashion Quarter Zip Pullover Turtleneck Knitted Sweater is a bit uncomfortable, the part that is uncomfortable is the turtle neck, it is just too large, and I have a fairly large neck and head, and this turtle neck is a few inches too large, I find myself sort of pulling it over my face, but then it is too tight around the bottom of my neck, and uncomfortable, but if I put it below the neck like is shown on the website, it is still uncomfortable, and I like turtle necks, it is just this one has  design issues, also the fabric coloring is a bit faded, and not as dark as shown, I do not recommend this sweater, the only way it feels some what OK is by totally unzipping it, but that defeats the purpose of a turtle neck sweater."
2.0,"I don't like leaving negative reviews but I depend on these same reviews for every purchase. I bought this ""sweater"" for my 27 year old daughter. It is not a sweater! The fabric is more like a heavy synthetic. The styling... bad. Creepy fabric meets ugly. I returned it."
2.0,Nice purse but doesn‚Äôt really hold my Apple 6S (smaller phone). I don‚Äôt really care for the chain shoulder strap. I ended up using it as a wallet.
2.0,"Works, but extremely loud."
2.0,"I like the earrings, but concern with the wire snapdown post, not durable poor workmanship .had to return"
2.0,"Was hoping for a sturdy, comfortable, water/outdoor shoe for our toddler. Run small and aren't pliable enough to get on without straining impatient toddlers foot or parents hands. Also started fraying within a few days."
2.0,"Will have to wait and see how they maintain their shape and color after a few washes. Will follow-up... Follow-up 2 FEB 2020: This underwear has shrunk at least one size if not two with washing, color has not faded much but the high percentage of spandex increases temperature and therefore sweating. The item description is misleading, title says bamboo-Rayon, but further below says 80% cotton 20 % Lycra. may 2020: The feel and fabric ""behavior"" makes me think it is 80% lycra 20% cotton. Not recommend..."
2.0,Not what I expected. The construction of the skirt wasn't great.
2.0,This was a gift for a one year old and it barely fits him. This is very small
2.0,This is one of those 1 size fits all unless you're not this size.  Just too tight.
2.0,"I like how you have a cute model in this unusual pose wearing a chef's coat, and calling it a woman's blazer. You did fool me,, I thought I was purchasing a stylish woman's blazer until it arrived and I saw that I was wearing a chef's jacket. The plus is, it is cotton,  and it's actually lined with cotton, so good job there. For that, you can have 2 stars. I don't think I can wear it to work though. Maybe I can figure out something to do with it. I certainly don't want to pay to mail it back to China."
2.0,I am not even going to wear it... though it is too cheap to really send back.  I would say the balloon is about the size of a golf ball... I mean it is big. I thought it would be dainty.  My bad.
2.0,"Based on the reviews, I upsized TWO sizes.  It was too tight to wear.  The material was stiff, but that might have softened in the wash.  Returned.  (I gotta stop buying this imported from Asia stuff.  They NEVER are sized properly.)"
2.0,I will try to post pics later. I'm 5 foot 1 and 147 lbs. I decided to get a medium so that it would be loose on me like the pictures but it looks nothing like the picture at all:( the fabric is cotton which is nice but the pockets can be seen right through the dress. Not very cute for what I wanted. I'll wear it in the house .. just a little disappointed because I totally forgot to check the reviews before buying this time.
2.0,"Very cute dress for someone who is short and petite. I'm 5'7 but the dress came up to my thigh reminded me when I use to wear &#34;baby dolls&#34;<br />None the less it's still a nice dress for the price however, the material is very cheap I couldn't help but feel like I was trying on a Halloween costume. Not for me so I returned it."
2.0,Made do with the dress without them.
2.0,It also had a tear in the top.  No paperwork enclosed to return.  Pants whew slightly too large.
2.0,"These pants would fit a giant.  My husband is 6' 1&#34; and always takes an XXL.  When we received this and I had him try them on, the crotch hit him at the knees and the length was at least a foot too long.  The material looked like pajama material."
2.0,One of the shawls was in a package and the other was not.  I feel like I am giving one person a new gift and the other person is getting a shawl that someone returned and didn't put it back in the package.  I am very disappointed in the shawl not in the package!<br /><br />Lavonne Arvin
2.0,It would have been nice had it worked. But the lights only flashed a little bit. I had to return it. I didn't purchase it again. It's a rubber kids watch. So don't expect it to last that long but it was decent quality.
2.0,Bends very easy. Cheap
2.0,"Super cheaply made. It'll look fine for decoration but aside from that buy something else. Also, definitely not &#34;handmade&#34; as the company name seems to imply."
2.0,"Color looks nothing like the picture. I wanted that exact color for a reasonthats why I ordered the burgundy. If you want burgundy, your not going to get it. I received a shirt that was mostly white with a burgundy blend. The dark burgundy part is the inside lining. Not what I wanted. The material is a bit rough and can easily get caught and start to mess up the shirt."
2.0,This was a Christmas gift for my oldest son the charm started falling off the same day he opened it waste of money
2.0,"Not the right look for me. I'm 5'6&#34;, 137 lbs., fairly large chested, and 57 years old.  I ordered a medium, my usual size, and it was far too tight. I think the next size up would be too tight as well.  Would be adorable on a younger or smaller chested person."
2.0,The hand and finger part of the glove fit well but the wrist area where you see lacing is way too tight.
2.0,The neckline does not lay neatly as it does in the photo.  It looks very cheaply made.
2.0,Order a few sizes larger....
2.0,"it looks great, but much too small. If you put over the hair, it slides off; if you put under the hair, it slides off, even if I stretched it out to the max length.  May be i should have gotten a men's size?"
2.0,See through  and  didn't  fit well.
2.0,"The embroidery is beautiful. The material is light weight but does not breathe. It's was hot, hazy, and humid when I tried the cover-up and it made me feel stuffy+sticky"
2.0,Disappointed in fit.  Material is nice.
2.0,So so!
2.0,"I sew.  This has serger chains hanging out all over the place, not trimmed.<br />The inside has raw seams that should have been finished invisible.<br />The raw seams effect the comfort ... it would never pass in a high school home economics class!<br />It is a dollar store item.  Seriously."
2.0,"I have average size arms at about 14"" and I have plenty of room in an XL (Extra Large) shirt however in this shirt I have NO room to spare in the arms which must from a children's shirt"
2.0,"Size up! Definitely too small, we got a medium (8-10) and it fit like a small. The arms and legs were too short."
2.0,"The print of the shirt is very cute. I love my Mini. The quality of the shirt is not the best. For the price it had a few loose strings. Also, there was no place to see the sizing. This shirt is in junior sizes, not womens. A small is really a 2-4. I'm usually a small, so I'm a little dissatisfied. Overall, the shirt came from the UK, so don't think that it will be an easy return process."
2.0,"I love crinkle dresses, and this one is a nice color, but it's cut weirdly (the front is short, too abruptly compared to back (at least for me). Main problem is that the back seam tore after three washings. (in cold water, no drier, gentle cycle)"
2.0,Made in China and very obviously so. Thin material and odd shape. Return
2.0,Not at all what I expected. Material was stiff. Felt like I was wearing a plastic bag. I was hoping for a light flowy summer dress. Highly disappointed
2.0,Not like the photo.
2.0,"In about 6 months, it stretched to the point it was falling off regularly.  Used to be a great product, don't know what happened."
2.0,"Lamentablemente vino con una imperfecci√≥n, en una parte se est√° descosiendo"
2.0,"Seller says ""new"" yet product looks used. Like it was a gift and they tried it once and didn't like it so tried to repackage it. Has personal writing on packaging saying ""congrats man"" with a smiley face.  Paid $42.11 - if I'm paying that much be HONEST about product and be NEW!  Very disappointed  Have pictures if the seller wants to contact me. Very annoyed.  As far as the product we have not used it yet but looks like the prior pair we had. It's Nike I'm sure they will be great!"
2.0,i ordered the black and pink set. they arrived in a small package which is nice. the only thing is that i expected the pink ones to be more opaque. i saw pictures where they seem almost mirrored however mine are simply a lightly tinted red (not even pink!) overall not completely satisfied....
2.0,I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2‚Äù and this top is really short on me. Otherwise it fits perfectly. If it were longer I would buy one in berry color.
2.0,"Very tight in wrist. There is a danger of tearing them apart sooner or later since the material they made of is very thin, and to put them on hand they need to be stretch significantly. In addition, the lining inside the glove is very prickly. I do not have tender skin, but I tried that lining against my skin, and even after one touch I experienced skin chafing."
2.0,"i ordered the ice blue and it's very pretty, pastel blue kinda.<br />but no belt??? I hope they either send the belt, or send me the money to cut off part of the bottom hem to make it into a belt becuse it really isnt the same without it. a little sheer, but nothing a nude cami can't fix.PLEASE SEND THE BELT. 2 STARS BC THE BELT SHOULDVE BEEN IN THE PACKAGE WITH THE DRESS!!"
2.0,"This was so cute and I was really hoping that it would work. However, as true to size as it may be around, unless you are about 5 feet or under this will probably not fit you. I am only 5'4&#34; and I could barely get the top over my breasts, and I really had to tug to get it there. It is very cute, but definitely not long enough."
2.0,Straps are too small for me
2.0,"It looks pretty enough online, but I can't even use this. The heart shaped clasp on this makes it impossible to fasten while you're wearing it, and if I fasten it while I'm not wearing it, I can't get it over my hand without it ending up too loose on my wrist. It's also difficult to get the watch to stay clipped into the band, especially when I'm struggling to make the clasp work. The only reason it gets two stars is because it looked like I was expecting it to. Just doesn't work without a struggle."
2.0,"I loved this shirt when I got it, I bought a medium and I'm 5'1 and weigh about 155, it fit perfect and looked really cute with leggings. Unfortunately I could only wear it half the day before my 2 year daughter got something on it and I washed it in a delicate bag like I do with most clothes I buy on her and the next time I wore it I started finding tiny holes in the fabric, if it wasn't for that I would have gave the shirt 5 stars and ordered more in different colors because it was really pretty and comfy."
2.0,Very impractical- can‚Äôt move your arms without your boobs coming out. You can‚Äôt wear a bra with it- and if you attempt boob tape it‚Äôs noticeable the fabric is thin. Cute for pictures only.
2.0,"The fit is great, the style is cute, and the fabric is soft. Unfortunately, the fabric is also really cheap. I've washed and worn this once and there are already holes and places where the fabric is worn through. I really like this piece, but I like being able to wear my clothes more than once even more."
2.0,Ran way too small 2xl more like an Tight Xl
2.0,I wore this to a NXT show and I was proud...until I washed it then it shrunk.
2.0,I bought for myself and it‚Äôs beautiful dress but unfortunately it‚Äôs way too big  and long for me. I can‚Äôt keep it and return it..
2.0,"The mens hoodie I ordered came with no tags on it, hair was on it that was not mine, smelled like perfume, and in the pocket was half a used infant sock?<br />Most likely a return sent to me.<br />You Never Know What You're Getting!"
2.0,"This purse doesn't look that good in person. It started out good. I liked that it had the two sides with the zipper section in the middles. A couple weeks after I started to use the shoulder strap, it broke. The handles are starting to come apart. Maybe if you don't put much in it, it will last longer."
2.0,Great at first but after 4 months the lenses are delaminating around the edges
2.0,"The tie that is use to tie the robe in the inside was not attached. I would like to exchange for one that is attached,  but my son loves it. Also 14 is about the size of a 12"
2.0,They should've said the shoe ran big
2.0,Not worth price
2.0,Jacket was to small and had to return it.
2.0,El material es suave y c√≥modo. Lo √∫nico malo fue que uno de los pantalones llego con un desperfecto de fabrica. Lo cocieron mal y tiene un huevo de de una pulgada.
2.0,"First, let me say that I haven't tried any similar products, so I have nothing to compare this to.  I ordered two because they were cheap...was hoping for the best...but this purchase was a total waste of money.  When I first felt the material, I thought it may do the trick.  But nope, it seemed to be nothing more than a thick stretchy tank.  It actually seems to make things look worse for me, as it flattens my pecs so there's no definition, making my gut appear bigger.  Lesson learned....as with most items, you get what you pay for.<br /><br />After wearing it twice, one positive thing is that I feel that it helps with my posture - helping me to sit up straighter and not slouch. On the downside I've also discovered that after wearing it for only a short period, that it is quite itchy."
2.0,Cut to low in chest area will have to wear tank to or camisole underneath
2.0,"Bought this to go with a Halloween costume, and the lights didn't work, and the plastic &#34;bones&#34; separated almost immediately from the fabric. They are not comfortable to wear, either. My 9 year old wore them trick-or-treating anyhow, and then we we were done with them."
2.0,"One thing I know well is fabric.  I have worked with a LOT of fabric and I am pretty good at determining certain things.  I originally got this dress because I intended to dye it.  I had a great design planned for this.  I believed the listing that this was rayon spandex.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This dress came in a plastic bag.  It is white.  There is a label inside marked 100% cotton.<br /><br />WORKMANSHIP<br />The workmanship on this dress is very good.<br /><br />STYLE<br />The style is okay, but if it was the fabric that it was listed as, it would have been better.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE FABRIC?<br />The label says 100% cotton in the dress.  This is NOT cotton.  The listing says that this is rayon and spandex.  It does not feel like that either, although it does have some wrinkle to it.  I really felt polyester in this, so I decided to test it.<br /><br />THE TEST<br />I cut a pretty good sized piece of fabric from a seam and then I did the burn test.  The burn test revealed that this is NOT cotton or rayon both of which will leave ash and smell somewhat natural in the burn.  What the burn test revealed is that this is synthetic and behaved most like polyester.  It lit then went out, and it curled and melted into a ball.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I took a photo of the test.  The reason for the strands is that I pulled them while hot.  They were small balls of melted goo with no ash whatsoever. The black ball is the match head which got stuck with a ball of goo.  I realize most people won't care about this, but for the few that might, I included it.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />This dress is NOT as advertised.  It is not comfortable like rayon or cotton.  It is uncomfortable like polyester.  I avoid polyester for that reason.  It is not a fabric like to wear often at all especially next to the skin.  The fit is okay, but the feel of the fabric is so annoying that I don't feel that it drapes right or even looks that great.<br /><br />Since I can not dye it I really have no use for this dress.  It is somewhat see through so I really don't want to wear it (fabric content aside).<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If this dress was rayon spandex, or cotton as labeled, I think it would look and perform better.  As it is, I do not like the fabric at all and I feel that it affects the drape and fit of the dress.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS. I am only giving this two stars because the workmanship is very good and if you are really into polyester you might like this dress.  I would give if 1 star if the workmanship was not so good.  The dress is mis-marked and for a person like me who has to avoid certain synthetics, that is a big deal."
2.0,It‚Äôs beautiful but it leaves lint everywhere. EVERYWHERE.
2.0,"The material doesn't give at all & it's extremely smaller than what it says. I wear 1x-2x. Ordered a 2x, it wouldn't even go over my chest or down my arms. It was more like a medium/large."
2.0,Glasses arrived crooked and won‚Äôt hold any adjustment a shop has made. I can‚Äôt wear them.
2.0,"[[VIDEOID:e37245d4a79f658e77a9075a44830af0]] I got this for my birthday from my mom. She was so excited, but upon opening it and putting it on my hand the elastic on the fingers immediately broke. We had to brake the remaining elastic bands and tie on stronger elastic bands just so we could get our moneys worth. I don‚Äôt recommend buying this product at all."
2.0,"I thought I was buying a Sage green colored top....this is fluorescent puce green. I am terribly disappointed. It was intended for my daughter. She wears a small in everything and this fits her like a med/large. It's very wide at the bust and waist band. She's 5'4 120 lbs. The length is fine for school, right at the waist line. Size down if possible and it should still be a bit slouchy."
2.0,This is not made for larger heads. It is so tight it gave me a headache. I tried two of the headbands just to be sure. It is a shame because I like the look. I will not be using these. #MoneyWasted!!
2.0,"I bought the first one and fitted me perfectly. It shows size 58. I asked my wife to buy me a second one as a b-day gift in a different color. The hat is exactly the same material, same style, same label showing size 58, but it doesn't fit  me. I measured it and its size is 56 while the label says size 58. That indicates poor quality."
2.0,This dress is so big on the top and is not flattering at all. It‚Äôs also completely hard to put on by yourself you have to have somebody helping you.
2.0,"Its alright. I looks like a tie and everything and certainly functions as a tie but i have a hard time believing this is silk, it feels nothing like the two dozen silk ties I have."
2.0,"Fits well at bust area, but way too long."
2.0,The straps in the back are kinda funny. Good colors tho
2.0,"These leggings are way smaller then I anticipated, they are stretchy though. The waistband looks and feels a little cheap but these are very inexpensive."
2.0,"While usually it wouldn't be a problem for an earcuff to be a bit too big, this earcuff is much larger than I anticipated.  It makes it look very cheap.  I lost it and I'm not sorry."
2.0,Is too difficult to keep on.  Straps don't hug feet. will donate.
2.0,The only thing I don't like about these shoes is the white plastic buckle. The item is shown so the buyer can't see the buckle in the picture. I was a little disappointed with how the white buckle looks on the pink Jelly...kinda cheap.
2.0,The chain is much too short
2.0,"I have several watches so I'm not particularly hard on any one.  Came in, was absolutely beautiful, but the paint chipped within 2 mths."
2.0,I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs made out of but I feel it was not worth it because it turns your skin green
2.0,"Personal preference, I did not like the material. It felt thick like a rash guard or swim shirt you wear at the beach."
2.0,"I am usually a large in everything, so I saw I should also fit a large in this dress. Nope! I can‚Äôt even button it at my chest and the sleeves are so tight I can barely move. Very sad because this is such a pretty dress!! I‚Äôm losing weight so hopefully I‚Äôll be able to wear it soon! Perfect with leggings in the fall and winter."
2.0,"Larger than expected, but chain broken in less than a week with nothing find to it for it to break. Son disappointed."
2.0,Thick and itchy. Returned.
2.0,I made sure not to wear when I shower or wash dishes. Just from it rubbing against my other fingers it has begun to tarnish
2.0,Got this on special. It is basically something you wear around the house. It's not flattering and even if it's loose it shows your trouble spots
2.0,"Not true to size at all I ordered 3x and still got asked was this my son shirt I was trying to squeeze into, I laughed but still felt like I wasted my money"
2.0,Very small! Go two sizes up. Nice material and cut.
2.0,Skirt is for a toddler. Tie and headband are for adults.
2.0,"This brand runs too small. I had purchased another suit, same barnd, and picked the ize I wear and it was too small. Thsi time I went up a size and the suit is still too small. The arm holes are also cut really samll. This feels more like a Juniors  suit and not an adult suit."
2.0,"Something was off about these boots so I returned them.  They were not the quality of my other Born boots.  They did not come in a Born Box, and the label on the box was not spelled correctly either.  Style was cute though and they fit good but not worth the money that I would spend on quality boots."
2.0,"Beautiful watch. Wish it kept time. I bought one, returned it since it kept stopping, bought another one, (or perhaps they just sent me the same one again) and this one was off by two days within a week."
2.0,It's A LOT longer in person than in the picture. Still very cute though.
2.0,"√¢Àú‚Ä¶√¢Àú‚Ä¶  from A. Wilson on May 9, 2017<br /><br />Adorable - Bad Materials<br /><br />It arrived crushed! I tried to get it back into shape, but the base itself is not a hard construct, but almost pellon-like, and as such showed every line/wrinkle from the crushing. It would not hold a shape. The top extensions and feathers were also smushed. It does have a nice big alligator clip inside, and comes with a separate, hard headband I'm guessing to attach to if needed.<br /><br />It's too bad, because it really is cute!"
2.0,Runs a little on the small side.
2.0,"The watch band is too narrow for my liking, I thought it was 22 mm, and it's 22 mm at the attachment<br />point and about 15 mm in the remainder.  I returned the item."
2.0,"The Sox are awesome. Great price. Great service. Well, they were for a little while. Then they got a run (don't know why) a.nd they were shot. I would not buy again."
2.0,This mask has a middle horizontal section and a flap on top and on the bottom.  The flaps make it difficult to get the mask on and off.  N95 and KN95 masks are much easier to us and I will go back to one of them.
2.0,"The top was extremely too small.  Needed a size 12 for an extremely thin daughter and it fit our extremely thin size 6 daughter.  Although the shorts fit as expected, I was disappointed in the quality."
