3.0,A little bigger than what I was expecting but then again my daughter is a small 9 year old.
3.0,"Nice quality band, however, because it is so thin, it doesn’t seem strong enough to center the watch on the wrist unless you really tighten the band which makes it uncomfortable.  If that doesn’t bother you then it really is a good quality band."
3.0,"I wear a size 6 1/2 ring size, so for most rings i need to order a size 7. I don't have any problem keeping the tape on, but depending on the ring, you can see the tape - which is rather tacky. Also tried those rubber ring guards. Not crazy about them either. The tubing has a tendency to fall off the ring, so the ring is rolling around your finger until you can get home to put another one on.  All in all, there are drawbacks with each option. The real solution is to accommodate those who wear a 1/2 size."
3.0,Ordered this from my previous orders list. The second bracelet I received was NOT the same as the first one. This one was darker colored and smelled like a tannery. Would not reorder
3.0,"the arms are much puffier than in the picture. send it back for that reason. too bad, cause I really liked the look."
3.0,"While the style is cute, it's too small on my daughter.  The plaid pattern doesn't look good on her too.  Returned.  Hope there is more other patterns in the future."
3.0,"The material and colors are beautiful!  Very soft. It is quite small.  In order to have the same look as the picture you would need more than one.  I would have no problem with that, as the cost is super reasonable..  My problem, Feel that the picture is misleading."
3.0,Extra extra warm but a little on the smaller size.
3.0,"It smelled badly of chemicals when I got it. I am large chested so I wasn't surprised the cups don't really fit. I managed to squeeze them in barely. What really a disappointment is that every time I tried to adjust the straps they would pop off. They have hooks and fabric loops. I ended up giving that up all together and just tying it to make it a halter top which works. Over all, cheap but has held up well. All the problems I have had with it are minor considering buying one is typically a horrible deal. Not buying again but it's cute and has worked this season."
3.0,I’m not home now<br />And I didn’t know if I could take pictures here
3.0,My son is in love with his shoe but it can't fit and we cannot return it. His other booths are 5.5 and it's the size I bought and it's tight even with the insole out.
3.0,Awkward fit. Could be a lot better.
3.0,This shirt fits fine minus it is short :( So only 3 stars as it is a bit odd looking becuase it is short and I am only 5'3
3.0,Looks good fit great
3.0,Bountiful but it scratched so fast
3.0,I love the design but these shoes run big.
3.0,They go flat in one day. For reference I’m 140 lbs.
3.0,Size is very small compared to most American sizes... The product looks nice and has a nice feel just make sure you get a size larger than you normally would
3.0,Not very high quality. Face scratched easily. Other watches for the same price purchased for my kids have held up better.
3.0,"It fit ok when I got it, but be careful as it shrunk in the wash and is now very short."
3.0,"This ""blazer"" worked very well for its intended purpose, wore it for a holiday party to make the dress i wore look a little more conservative. The material was a lot thinner than i expected but i live in phoenix so keeping warm is not a concern. The blazer looked great with my dress. I washed it the next day because it was all stretchef out with creases around the elbows. I washed on delicate cycle then hung to dry and now looks horrible. The fabric had already started pilling so i threw it out since i won't wear it looking like that. Definitely a 1 time use blazer unless u never wash it."
3.0,"If you want a very lightweight sweatshirt this is for you. The length is  fine, mid thigh.The sleeves appropriately long.The zipper is metal but the zipper pulltag is plastic coated silver. I will keep this one. But look for something thicker and more sweatshirt like ."
3.0,The post is very long and pokes into me.
3.0,Wanted this to match a necklace and earrings. Stone is pretty colour but very thin and large. Very thin silver. Looks cheap-- didn't like it.
3.0,"a bit ""cheap"" fabric"
3.0,"Color isn't what I expected, but nice leggings never the less."
3.0,Color faded only after a couple of washes
3.0,Runs too small. I am returning it. Quality was okay though.
3.0,They say these have a spring hinge - mine DO  NOT have a spring hinge.
3.0,WAY smaller than advertised!
3.0,It does the trick.  Blocks the sun.  Runs a little large though
3.0,"My toddler has narrow feet and her toes kept slipping out of the front. Seems like they were made for a wider flat foot. Also, the bottoms of the shoes were very slippery on hardwood floors."
3.0,"Not a bad mask but could not get over the ""toxic"" smell and had to return it."
3.0,The material is not what i thought it would be. It is very stiff and weird to tie. The overall shoe though looks super cute.
3.0,"Nice earrings, however not the deep blue I was looking for"
3.0,"The color is rather dull. Inside is nice and spacious. I can carry phone, tablet and lunch. Again the color is dull."
3.0,Doesnt look so much appealing.
3.0,Size is ok but the fabric is not as good a quality as what is pictured.
3.0,"Fabric and quality were okay for an inexpensive dress. Totally unflattering on me - Size M, 130lbs., 5'5"", 60 year old body - totally accentuated my middle pooch. Returned."
3.0,Runs small and is short. I am only 5' 1 and it ran short.
3.0,"Too small, my daughter tried on she’s a 1 1/2 and we bought 2 but she complained her feet her when she tried it on."
3.0,The bracelet was too large for my wrist.  The quality and look was average.
3.0,Wish there were more colors
3.0,This is a cute top. Looks good with leggings. I am not impressed with the fabric.
3.0,Not for her.
3.0,For a gift and the baby is not here yet so not sure how they will fit.  They are for a newborn and will be interested to see how long they fit.  If they really go to 12 months.
3.0,Cute but pockets are too big and it’s itchy!
3.0,Fair. Thanx
3.0,Way too small. Not proportional
3.0,These are really cute glasses but since my son has to wear them each and every day the inside would wear down his nose to the point where he bled....for occasional use good
3.0,"loved the screen print, but hard to open & close!"
3.0,"Runs small, if you’re looking for a loose fit I’d suggest going 2 sizes up. I expected it to be longer but stops at end of stomach and start of hip bone. The fabric is nice for working out or for a cooler autumn day. I like it just wanted it longer."
3.0,"The material is nice, the print is fun and the fit is probably a little off in the waste area. It's wide which is not how it's pictured."
3.0,Super cute bathing suit... Downfall to it is that it's a little too small. The underwear part barely covers the bottom area & if you move around a little too much I'm sure the top area would let you have a little slip. I feel like this bathing suit is meant for smaller people.
3.0,They don't really open wide enough to put on which makes them difficult to wear
3.0,Fits like a tent. Quality is good otherwise.
3.0,This pin is very very big.  It is pretty however.
3.0,"I love this purse! ...the only thing is that there's a blur mark on Frankenstein's jacket, which must have been a mistake when the purse was made. It's not a super big deal but a little disappointing to spend almost $60 on a purse and it has a defect. Still love it, but obviously quality isn't the greatest."
3.0,"The dress was of decent quality, the material is very stretchy but not very forgiving. It looked AMAZING from the back, but I wouldn't recommend this dress for someone who is large chested. Even with my strapless bra I was totally spilling over (I wear a DD). My friends also thought the seam in the front where the straight part meets the flowy bottom looked awkward.Ultimately would look better on someone with a smaller frame."
3.0,"Came in larger sizes,42I,but was to flimsy to hold the girls where they need to be."
3.0,Dress is not as shiny as the one pictured. It’s nice but I was a little disappointed it was the same color & fabric as the pic. It’s true to size.
3.0,"Great single bane, but the other band would not install, even when I trimmed it slightly."
3.0,"Not as I expected. Too long at the bottom, intended for tacked."
3.0,"They shrunk a ton! I'm used to things shrinking a size but these became super tiny after an accidental drying.<br />The colors while very bright and bold upon arrival faded extremely fast, after the one accidental drying the colors appear to be as though they've been washed and dryer for years and years.<br />They are comfortable.<br />They are see-through, nice for around the house as long as you're around people comfortable seeing your package in it's entirety.<br />Very affordable is definitely the saving grace with these."
3.0,Nice light weight gloves but not warm
3.0,They were perfect for my son that is 9... I thought they were a small
3.0,"It runs very small, I ordered a 2XL, which in any other shirts I purchase would be baggy, and it's tight enough that I would not wear it outside my house.  I wanted something I could wear to exercise outside but that isn't going to be happening.  Order a couple sizes up if you want to be comfortable/aren't a twig."
3.0,Very flimsy and sticky material is starting to peel after a few uses. The leather buckle is nice.
3.0,This bag has a very heavy odor to it. I have not been able to carry it yet. It smells like a petroleum product. Not really happy with it.
3.0,Fit is too tight - not enought elastic.  Adjustable is better.  Returned item.
3.0,Ok. But not what I expected.
3.0,"fit nice, pretty detail - broke at the hinge in 3 weeks. Pop in plastic pins - not real hinges."
3.0,This is NOT a comfortable shoe.The irritating stand up edge on heel is awful.And the shoe is not light
3.0,Surprised by the copper-look metal around face. A little difficult to fasten.
3.0,So I’m 5’5 215 pounds and ordered the xxlarge because I wanted it to fit loose and it does. I ordered white because someone commented it wasn’t see through but it kinda is. I have to wear a nude bra and panties with a nude slip so u don’t see anything. Love the pockets and adjustable straps.
3.0,IF YOU WANT A MINI DRESS GET AN EXTRA LARGE. I AM 5&#34; 6&#34; WEIGHT 115. FIRST ORDERED A MEDIUM FIT LIKE A TUNIC THEN I BOUGHT AN LARGEST SIZE THE HAD. SEXY AS ALL GIT OUT
3.0,"I ordered the plain style of this dress in the wine color. I weigh around 135 lbs, I'm 5'3&#34; and I have a semi-muscular build. I measure 26-27 inches around the waist and about 37 inches around the biggest part of my hips, and I wear a 34D bra. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I ordered a medium. The first thing I noticed when I tried on the dress was that it was pretty difficult to get on because there was no zipper. After I was finally able to yank the dress on, I noticed that it was pretty tight in the arms, but I have muscular arms for someone my size. I wouldn't have minded this if the waist had also been more fitted. I found the waist to be too loose, and rather than emphasizing my hourglass figure, it diminished it and made my look kind of straight. The hip/leg part fit pretty well, but I thought the shoulder/bust area was too wide. I would reorder this dress in a small, but my arms hardly fit in the medium, so I doubt they would fit in the small. I thought the quality of the fabric was good, and I liked the color, so I'm disappointed it doesn't fit like I hoped. I don't think this dress is very flattering on my body type, so I will probably return it."
3.0,I like the pants they fit just right however the material is scratchy and not the most comfortable to wear
3.0,"very sheer, wasn't exactly what I was expecting"
3.0,Shape is a lil different than expected. Still a nice mirror finish though👍
3.0,This shirt seems to be an easily wrinkled loose material.
3.0,"the bag was smaller than I thought, the handles are not like this in the picture.  cute bag"
3.0,"I bought the large expecting the shirt to run small, as most clothing does online, and the shirt still came in waaaaayyy smaller that expected. If you wear a large I would suggest you get at least an XL for the shirt to fit and an XXL if you like your shirts to fit loosely."
3.0,not quite what I was looking for.
3.0,Great deal and cute shoes but started to fall apart right away. The first day my son wore them I noticed the orange by the toe was peeling off.
3.0,This fabric is awesome. The sizing is where this item fell short. I got a large fit bottom. Perfectly but was tight on  my breast. Go a size up r 2.
3.0,I liked like the style but I returned it when I found one spot had a bad stitch in it then I noticed a old game card in it with some ones name embossed on it. Returned maybe? mix up somewhere down the line? I ordered a different one by the same manufacturer but I won't see it for another week.
3.0,"Cute product, light broke within the first couple hours."
3.0,The dress looked as expected but it was too close at the zip
3.0,Están cómodos pero uno me llego con un oyo y no se puede usar los otros dos bien
3.0,"It's ok. Nothing special. Not as colorful as picture. The arm came off on third wear & believe me, it had a sedate day!"
3.0,Arrived damaged.  The face of watch was popped up.  We had to push it back in.  Fortunately it charged and turned on so we keep it.  It's a Christmas gift for my daughter so I dont have much more to say about it at this time.
3.0,"I ordered this 3 times. Only once did I get the right dress and it was the wrong size so I finally gave up. I ordered a different dress from the same company twice with great results! Otherwise cute dresses, just not what my bridesmaids could use."
3.0,"Product returned in a bag it came in, sent back less than a week after received"
3.0,So this is a neat prop. However it doesn’t open or do anything. For the price I was expecting more.
3.0,"Really nice! Good quality, just a lot bigger than expected."
3.0,The bottom fits and the top is to small..But it cute.. I had to buy another another swim suit to make the top look better
3.0,Slit to high and to material to sparkling
3.0,Bought these for my fiancé as he likes sunglasses like some women like purses or shoes. After wearing them once or twice he was cleaning the lenses off and one of the lenses slid out of the groove they sit in. It won't go back in so there is a sliver of light that passes through between the nose piece and the lens itself. Other than that he likes them.
3.0,Very light/no shaping. Feels like wearing pantyhose without control.  I thought these would have more shaping/tension in the material or be more like athletic tights.  Ok for lounging but not great otherwise.
3.0,I have not worn the dress but not what I expected.
3.0,"The description said US size 6. What I received was an European size 39 which converts to a 7 or 7 1/2. It is a lovely shoe: nice lines, lovely blue-grey color, croc embossed leather, 2 1/4 inch heel. However that does me no good at all if the shoe does not fit. Buyers -- be certain you check the correct (converted) size."
3.0,"I love the way it looks, but the back has several areas that almost cut into my skin.  Therefore, I can't wear it to work.  It's just too long.  I don't know what to do about the sharp edges."
3.0,"It is too big, I even tried washing and drying it and still too big."
3.0,"The dress looks like the photo but its stored and shipped folded down so you do have to work to fluff it out. I recommend giving yourself plenty of time before an event to fluff it out and settle properly.<br /><br />The fabric offers no stretch. There doesn't seem to be anything itchy inside. The designs are sewn on securely. The 2 white patterns on the skirt sit much lower than expected (lower thigh closer to knees instead of the upper thighs or near hips).<br /><br />The dress is all around too large, especially the chest. My daughter normally wears a 3, but I ordered a 2 expecting this to run a little big. That wasn't enough, it's still much too wide, and surprisingly too long since she's on the tall side. Last check up she was somewhere in the 80s percentile height, around 40th percentile weight."
3.0,Not true to size. Too much trouble to return
3.0,"Lovely colors, soft and comfortable, but for a sweater it is incredibly thin! I can actually see through the fabric to my bra underneath."
3.0,Nothing to keep it closed in the middle. Opens and shows everything.<br />But I do like the shirt. Wish it came in more of summer colors.
3.0,the bar is TOO LONG but its definitely the style i was looking for
3.0,"I needed a small toiletry bag for an upcoming cruise I'm taking. I purchased the burgundy/wine colored bag and it is true to color. It actually is a bit bigger than it looks, but still fits great in my suitcase. I did notice there were a few small holes/puncture marks in some spots, so I hope it will hold up well. I will update after the cruise to see if the holes were a major factor."
3.0,Fit well and cute print but man the fabric is so cheap. It’s thin and almost see through not to mention feels like a plastic tablecloth. Husband hated it
3.0,"Earings are very pretty, I was not pleased with the fact they came bent to the side. I had to bend the post back up and was afraid they were going to snap. We will see how they hold up. Hopefully well, fingers are crossed"
3.0,Very little tread on soles of socks.  Not like a hospital type sock that I was expecting.
3.0,It was suitable for the price
3.0,"beautiful, but impractical for covid-19!"
3.0,"I got a black pair like this from the same brand and they fit perfectly so I wanted to get brown as well.. they fit completely different. Same style, same size, and the brown pair is way too big in my waist/hips. Pretty disappointing"
3.0,Poor quality but OK for kids dress up
3.0,the straps are not adjustable which makes this bra uncomfortable on the shoulders. But as far as support its probably my favorite. I just cant wear for long days because of the tightness of the shoulder straps.
3.0,Larger weave braid than expected also closure is not where one person can put it on
3.0,its a t-shirt emblem on front smaller than expected but nice t-shirt.
3.0,"Love this outfit! Only downfall is the arm do NOT stay off the shoulder. It rides up onto your shoulder which really bothers me because I bought it because I was looking for off the shoulder. It has beautiful vibrant colors and a flattering fit. I'm a curvy girl at 5' 5"" and 162 lbs and I got a large"
3.0,"like all clothes you buy on amazon, the size runs smaller than expected."
3.0,Cute onesies but the ones I got were 2 packs of the same 5 prints.  That is disappointing.
3.0,bad fabric quality
3.0,Like the fit. It's what I expected.
3.0,Looks very nice but not true to size.  Ordered a 2XL because I wanted it big.  Couldn't get my arms in it.  Fit like a medium.
3.0,So I was Super Excited when I randomly came across these. I really wanted what I saw in the picture. And I am so sick of &#34;oversized/loose fit&#34; advertising. The model is probably an extra small but is wearing the large sized overalls. So if you are a regular large and you buy a large then No they won't be baggy fit.<br />The color and pattern is on point so they are still cute but again the leg length doesn't come down as far as the picture.
3.0,It not the one I imagined.  The quality could be better.
3.0,"I love the colors and fabric of the bras.  The pads are a little too small for the bras, so they made indentions through my shirt.  I took the pads out and they are comfortable, but don't give me a lot of support when exercising.  They are great for yoga and low impact.  The full coverage back is great.  I am still a little worried about the zippers staying up in the front, but so far, they have stayed put, even through hip hop class."
3.0,"The frames look nice, but the lens quality is not very good; the refraction is not uniform so there are blurry spots in the filed of vision. I guess you get what you pay for..."
3.0,I am only 5'9&#34; and 180 lbs. and had to let the suspenders all the way out and they are still tighter than I would like. Should be advertised for short people only.
3.0,Only after a few wears it started to get that fuzziness/lint balls on both the inside and out. I don't like it on the inside of my clothes so I sometimes have to wear a tank top underneath it. Which in my opinion defeats the purpose sometimes.
3.0,Great magnetic band. The magnets are strong and hold well. My only complaint is that over time the band does darken and discolor a bit.  It does work well and is a good value
3.0,"Bought this for my 12yo, and it will barely fit my 9yo out of the box. If it shrinks at all in the wash, it will be useless. :("
3.0,"The adhesive was very sticky, when the metal piece guiding it on fell off, it all just looked super dirty"
3.0,Cute fit<br />Inexpensive fabric- very sheer
3.0,"Set was very attractive, but the product description said that the smaller bag is carry-on size, but it's too large.  Was sad to return this."
3.0,"I really like this robe, but it is falsely advertised as cotton. The one I got is clearly labeled as rayon. I debated returning it, but I love the mauve pink color and it is large enough to cover my pregnant belly, so I’m keeping it."
3.0,"This is a comfortable dress but not really my style. It is an athletic wear material (like leggings). Which makes it nice for summer if you get too hot it seems like it would be breathable. I liked the length too. Im 5'8"" and 160lbs in a size small. It fit bigger than most smalls so I would size down if ordering this item. I felt like the knot created a bit of a push where my tummy is and didn't love that which is why I felt like its wasn't the most flattering dress. Overall this is an ok product for the price."
3.0,you get what you pay for ..these are cheaply made I would suggest these for playing dress up!
3.0,"Fits well around torso, but sleeves are tight"
3.0,"Very beautiful product, but runs big."
3.0,Nice but not worth $30+. The material is quite thin and feels cheap. But it is exactly as pictured.
3.0,This is not a shirt I would wear on its own. It's almost like a cami that you would wear under a sweater.
3.0,I like to wear this to work with my shirt and tie.. I've gotten a lot of compliments since I started wearing this watch.
3.0,Too tight around the calf. I much prefer sockwell brand. Seam too big around toes as well.
3.0,"A very attractive watch but feels very cheaply made. For the price oint i paid, I'm satisfied."
3.0,This is a super cute outfit. It runs super small. I got an extra large and it fits like a medium. My daughter will love it.
3.0,Very slim crotch which causes then to ride up and bind also shrank at least a size when washed. Very disappointed as Hanes are usually much better than this and I expected a better quality product.
3.0,Looks nice but you get what you pay for - very soft material. I don't think it'll last long.
3.0,It took a long time to arrive. It's a t-shirt not a tank top... I kept it but it was not what I was expecting.
3.0,Inside is plastic. Too small. cheep.
3.0,Ok so it's not too bad but for the price I paid I was expecting way more... I mean I have natural 36DD and we all know that if u have natural big breast u need a good support! Unfortunately this top doesn't give u support if u are natural big breast!
3.0,Only reason for the 3 stars is because I returned it due to the tighter fit.  Loved the fabric.
3.0,"The watch is beautiful, but I was very disappointed when the wood around the watch face broke to pieces after just a few months of wear.  A watch of this price, I would expect to be of better quality."
3.0,It didn't fit at all like the photo. It was loose and I dont think a smaller size would have helped. I like the color but that's about it. I haven't worn it since.
3.0,I like the shoes but way to big. I usually wear 9.5 and they only had a 10. I ordered. My daughter wears a 11.5 and they fit her nicely.
3.0,The outer ring of the face is more of a dark brown than black. Nice but not what I was expecting
3.0,Doesn't fit 'as expected'.<br />Order a size larger.
3.0,"This hat is runs very small, and even on a small head I don't think it would cover the ears. It's very thick though so it'll keep the very top of your head very warm. I personally don't like the feel of the material its made of so next time I think I'll get a cotton one."
3.0,Not as strong as I thought they would be. The start to fall / slip through out the day
3.0,This is a very comfortable belt and I like it. Unfortunately the buckle is not as portrayed. It is black plastic and not silver in color as portrayed in the pictures. It changes the total look of the belt.
3.0,"It’s pretty, looks as advertised, it doesn’t stay up well tho. The gems drag it down. Needs a sturdier fabric."
3.0,"Super cute, but feels like if I wash it, it will completely lose it's shape."
3.0,"Hubby found the slippers to be a little short in toe room.  He can wear them, but would have liked them just a little longer."
3.0,"Seemed to be ok when we opened the package, but within a few hours of wearing them on Halloween, taking them on and off a few times to wash hands,  the stitching came out and they started to come apart at the seams.<br /><br />Needless to say, it was a one night love affair, and they did not make it until morning."
3.0,Not as pretty as described or in the picuture
3.0,I purchased this for a tragus piercing I had for a year. I wanted to try something new and saw these and thought they were so pretty and decided to purchase them. They arrived on time but I was skeptical in changing my earring because my skin is extremely sensitive.<br />A few weeks went by and I decided to try it 2 weeks ago. It got infected. (I cleaned it with Dial soap and water and then alcohol for initial placement) The area around my piercing became infected. I cleaned it with Dial for 2 weeks straight and still no change. I took it off and put the plastic one in and in a few days the swelling went down. This is not surgical steel.<br />Another good thing about the earring is that its a snug fit so I didnt have to worry about it falling out...but its also hard to come out. You will have to pry it apart to get it off.
3.0,Nice shirt. I ordered a large and I am pretty sure jt is a 2 xl.
3.0,The veil is completely flipped over the top<br />Of the hat. I’m trying to bend it back but we shall see how stubborn it is. How I despise contrary veils.
3.0,"Feels a little bit tight, I would recommend buying one size bigger.  Is OK but will not buy it again."
3.0,"It isn’t very warm at all, the hood blocks the wind but this coat is definitely not meant for winter cold.  I usually wear a medium or large in most coats and in this I should have gotten a small, I am lost in it. The only reason I haven’t returned it is because the post offices are crazy."
3.0,"I have mix feelings on this. The inner liner is huge, the sleeves bunch up while I am wearing  this while the outer jacket sleeves are shorter. As for warmth its okay, but when you have strong winds causing negative temps it isn't warm enough for me.<br />I also find that it's too tight on my shoulders  especially when driving.<br />My husband says I look nice in it, he likes the fit,, and color"
3.0,"This is a cute little bootie. My daughter has wide feet, though, so we returned them because she claimed they were too tight. They will probably be fine for standard width feet."
3.0,I like the pattern of this sleep wear set. But the quality is just so so.
3.0,everyday wear. wears out fast.
3.0,"Too tight to even try on. Needs to go back. Material has very little stretch, more of a gaberdine."
3.0,"These fit my watch band just fine however I am very disappointed at how thin these are. By the looks of the photos they appear much thicker, I only hope they hold up to my heavy duty Invicta watch band."
3.0,Not good to use on a scanner or cellphone and not good for really cold weather. Hands still cold.
3.0,If it was more of a cottony material I think I would love it. The cut is great but the material is not the best.
3.0,"The dress was perfect and fit well, I am 5'6 and normally wear a size small. Unfortunately the tights are extremely small, as i normally wear a size 2 in jeans and they didn't come up past halfway up my thighs. I did end up buying a new pair of tights. I agree with the other reviewers about the wig. I simply went without because id rather not be wearing a mesh cap with a little bit of yarn attached to it. Being that halloween costumes are expensive, I'd say the value (with the tights and wig issue) is more in the $30 price range."
3.0,"you get what you pay for. gets the job done, but they are very smelly of chemicals."
3.0,too small to be comfortable but big enough to squeak by for a short time.
3.0,I bought two and one of them broke within the week. They said I could return it and get a new one but shipping would cost me as much as just buying a new earring.
3.0,I got the black one the cooler does not detach. And the strap is short so you can’t carry it over your shoulder. It was only $14 so it seemed too good to be true.
3.0,"This hat really needs some neck protection.  Any hat meant to simulate the mad bomber design needs to at least try to simulate its effect.  The fabric isn't thick enough, which leaves the wearer cold.  The snap-on front offers little protection against wind."
3.0,"I've worn it a couple of times. It looks good, but I'm concerned that like all 2-straps stitched together belts, the inner, lesser quality strap will break down too soon for me."
3.0,"super cute but i didn't get to wear them because they were so large. order your true size or slightly smaller, they are supposed to sit low on the hips i think."
3.0,Returned. Too large
3.0,"Well the first one I received had a cracked visor, so I contacted amazon and received another 3 days later. I love the visor....."
3.0,The dress is good but too long for me as I am 5 ft 1inch. It almost nears my ankle. Had to return it as wearing long dress not my preference.
3.0,A little more yellow than I expected. The picture looked a little more of a mustard color which is what I wanted.
3.0,"Cute shirt overall, but runs small. Consider sizing up."
3.0,"Top is see through, so be aware !"
3.0,"The items I received did not include any scissors or trimming shears. The tweezers are good quality and the blades aren’t too small, but not too large."
3.0,"I was so excited to get this top. The overall fit is perfect. The main reason i got this shirt was for the thumb holes. Unfortunately the thumb holes seem to be off. When i put my thumbs in the reast of the sleeves fabric completely covers my hand, past my fingers."
3.0,"This dress is perfect, love the pockets. Fits well."
3.0,"The dress fits well and is of good quality, but I thought I came with a belt and I did not receive one."
3.0,I expected the sweater to be cropped like I. Tbd photo but it’s definitely not. Goes to my waistline. Pretty colors though
3.0,Fit a bit on the smaller side and the material is very thin. Seem to be reasonably well made. Received them recently so not sure about their durability.
3.0,"Decent dress, thin and pattern was off."
3.0,"The dress is slightly larger than expected. The fabric on top drapes in an unflattering way. It's voluminous and not fitted as it appears in the photos. I'm large busted, so it would look far worse on a person with a small chest."
3.0,"These are beautiful, full faced, masks, light weight and comfortable.  They allow for talking without constantly adjusting them. My chief complaint is because they do not have a nose wire, and are cut straight across, they do not sit along my face and interfere with my vision - its a huge bummer because otherwise i LOVE these masks but this is a huge negative for me so will not purchase again."
3.0,Thinner than I thought
3.0,"Based off the reviews I ordered a size up. I'm 5'7&#34; and 34B and about 150 lb. I'm normally a medium for most things and I wanted a longer tank but this one I should have stuck with the medium. It's rather long actually, coming about mid thigh for the Large. The top was roomy for me as well. I didn't like how the material sort of flipped out at the bottom. I know it was too large for me but it wasn't obnoxiously large so I assume the medium would do that as well. Material wise it was fine, not too thin and soft."
3.0,"OK, worth what I paid for it."
3.0,Is a bit of rough material
3.0,These are really thick and won't fit in my tall boots. I do like the color of them.
3.0,These are definitely juniors.  Not what I was expecting when I ordered them.  Great color though.
3.0,it is a bit small
3.0,"super big, giving harry potter vibes. but i like them for cosplay"
3.0,"I think I paid around $20 for this and had assumed it would be almost exactly like it is. The logo is a sticker on the front, and the wallet is very thin imitation leather. But it's what the husband wanted so it's what he got."
3.0,Beautiful shirt too bad they sent a medium when I ordered an xxl.
3.0,Would have gave 5 stars but the quality isn’t great. I had a hole after a couple days
3.0,maybe purchase 2 sizes larger than you normally would.  The T-shirt is very cute.
3.0,size and color
3.0,Pretty thin and was a tad too big so didn't hang as I had hoped.  Small sizes might be fine though.
3.0,"The band is nice.  However, thought it was a quick release band because that was my search in Amazon.  Decided to keep it instead of returning it because the cost was low.  However, product is very nice.  I will use it and change the band on one of my other watches."
3.0,Good cheap SUNGLASSES‼️
3.0,I bought a dress by MOOSA that is very similar to this one but it is sleeveless. I love that one. With fall coming I thought the sleeves would be nice. I almost bought a med because the first one I bought ran a tab big. BUT I bought the large because I'm a 36dd. The top portion of the dress is a tab tight so if it shrunk at all it wouldn't fit. The bottom under the band is darted in the front and the back. The back puffs like one of those really old fashion dresses and the front puffs because the darting is right under the boobs in the centre. Therefore the dress makes you look heavier and pregenat. I was very disappointed. :(
3.0,Reminded me of something purchased from China
3.0,I am thoroughly satisfied with my dusters.  They do run small but all in all it was a great find. You get what you pay for comes to mind.
3.0,"This is a nice sweater, like the look and it is comfortable. Just a little different in  the style."
3.0,"I expected something slightly different. The belt was too small and couldn’t fit around my waist. I wear a 3x and decided to go up a size just in case, but the 4x is small on me so I guess I should have ordered a 5x. The material is good and overall an ok dress. Looks like something you would get off of the Wish app. I didn’t like it. For some reason I thought it would look better on me."
3.0,Very pretty necklace.  I ordered the rose gold color and it was too pink for my liking
3.0,"Only two of the 6 had hinges , and one of those fell apart as soon as I opened the package. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Will not buy from this seller again."
3.0,Slightly uncomfortable but ig it works for reaper costume
3.0,The quality wasn't the best but it was very cute
3.0,Cute design and nice blue symbol pattern.  Fabric OK soft.  Strange odor out of the package.  Too small for the XL size - maybe not to US size standards.  Comfortable and shorts have pockets.
3.0,"Had I realized my purchase would take so long to arrive, I would not have added it to my cart. But on the other hand, now that I have it I'm satisfied."
3.0,"BUYER BE AWARE, this product is great but it shrinks like crazy after single wash. I ordered XL and after the 1st wash it looks like S/XS"
3.0,"I bought these for my 85 year old Mother because her feet are always so cold when she is sleeping. I researched what socks are best and found these. Beautiful ""socks"", but NOT slipper socks. There is nothing on the sole to prevent slipping. So now, I just purchased the material that is anti-skid in footie pajamas and will be sewing it into the sole of the sock, to insure my Mother will not fall."
3.0,One of the three shirts had discoloration like faded
3.0,It is a very organized  wallet for every thing I need to travel with. I can just take it and have all I need to run to the store quick.
3.0,"Bought the mirror lens one base on good reviews. Received it in 2 days. Amazon prime 2 day shipping rocks! However, I am disappointed at the product. The frame has a very plastic feel. I am not sure what kind of metal it is if it is in fact metal. The lens is very dark. Polarization wasn't as good at my last $30 sunglasses."
3.0,"These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.<br /><br />The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.<br /><br />Overall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away."
3.0,I’m 5’5” 134 pounds. Can normally fit small sometimes medium. This is a medium and it was really tight. Material very reviling which I’m normally ok with if going out but I would pass on this.
3.0,"Beautiful dress. Fabric felt a little cheap- very thin. Also, if you’ve got a gut, you’ll have to suck it in my friend- this dress is not forgiving with a breeze. On the plus side, very easy to pack."
3.0,tela algo gruesa pero bien
3.0,"I think the general consensus across ALL reviewers, at least those in the US, is that this shirt runs very small. I ordered the 2xl in the color black and I definitely need a couple sizes bigger considering I am an xl to 2xl in normal clothing. So while the shirt was ridiculously small on me, it is actually well made and very cute. Definitely worth the price. I plan on just giving it to one of my smaller friends, but I absolutely recommend you go 2-3 sizes larger than what you normally would. Perhaps a disclaimer right up front advising US customers to order 2 sizes up would be helpful for those of us who just do not have the time to sift and read through the reviews? This would save the many many reviews stating the obvious, which is that the shirt, while cute, is ridiculously small.<br /><br />For the price YES this is very much worth it- especially if you order the correct size. I purchased this item at a discount for the purpose of testing and reviewing. This discount absolutely has no bearing on my comments or opinions presented as I am in no way affiliated with the seller or manufacturer. If this review was helpful please click YES below! Much appreciated and a big Thank You for reading."
3.0,"I loved these when they arrived! They fit great, looked great but about a week after receiving them the frame broke, and not by sitting on them or anything crazy, but just by putting them on!<br />Wasn't a hard fix with a little bit of super glue...<br />But then about 2 weeks after that, putting them from my face to the top of my head the frame broke in a completely different spot!<br />Now there's a chance I could've received a bad pair, or maybe they're all this way...<br />But I wish it wouldn't have happened, cause I really loved the style and the fit!<br />I want to order another, but not waste more money..."
3.0,Cant make out the face on the keyring. Doesnt resemble the artist at all.
3.0,"Bought these for the hubby and they fit great,  and look great. The black came a bit bluer than expected and I guess o didn't read the product details closely enough but they actually look more like jeans. Also, make sure you get a lint roller because they pick up lint like crazy?!!"
3.0,Bought it for a Disney cruise it look nice I’m for the first hour or two but it was hard to keep it longer. Had to switch to the traditional o e after awhile.<br />Kept it for a  future just to be “in the Disney mood” but definitely not to wear for long periods.
3.0,You can tell these are costume jewlery. The gold is not shiny.
3.0,It is not big enough to medium.  Looks like small
3.0,"The front of this set is fantastic. 5' 2"" 110 wearing a small and the bottom back has a ton of material that bunches up and looks bad. set returned."
3.0,I am keeping it but it is to big. using for just around the house with a tank top under it
3.0,Oh nope to slippery don’t stay down felt sloppy don’t use them for sure not getting more
3.0,Not for larger chested women. The dress is so beutiful.
3.0,"I like the feel of them very much, but don't know if they'll last too long...  Extremely thin cotton."
3.0,"I had the x large, they didn't fit as high wasted and they felt as if I had to keep pulling them up and didn't feel right in the crotch. Yes, soft material, but had to return!"
3.0,Fits great. Dull color per my 9 yr old son whom I bought them for.
3.0,Nice set to have for any occasion. The earrings made my ear lobes itch really bad
3.0,Little bit too small<br />Not as thick as expected
3.0,I love the variety of colors and designs but the balls and spikes are made of plastic and will often split or break if you accidentally screw them on too tight.
3.0,To small but liked it
3.0,This is a nice long sweater just a little lighter than I expected. It wrinkles easily.
3.0,I found these a little too stiff to walk in comfortably.  I returned them.
3.0,not what I expected but still keeping since hard to find Dockers in the area this year.
3.0,Strap around the neck isn’t adjustable.  But the apron is super adorable!
3.0,"The &#34;medium&#34; size fits fine, but this &#34;navy&#34; piece is nearly black, not as blue as the picture conveys. Disappointing."
3.0,"It's gorgeous!! BUT... the waist is super high... there's no way it would fit like in the pictures...<br />The solution for me was simple, I just folded the waist... works... It's SO beautiful I don't even care!!! &#60;3"
3.0,"Lots of pockets, looks sharp, but my pair labelled 36 fits like a 34."
3.0,This was a nice shirt but it runs small. Ordered large but I REALLY need xl. I would order again but in a bigger size.
3.0,"Dress is ok, I'm 5,7 and it's almost right up to my bum."
3.0,"Not quite as luxurious as I was expecting but the fit was good and the quality seems good... we shall see how they last.  The main disappointment was that I didn't received the colours in the photo.  6 of the pairs were nice colours and similar to the ones in the photo, but one pair was a horrible green and another was canary yellow which I would never pick.  Bit disappointing for the money."
3.0,Size runs big.  Other than that quality was good and for those Illini Alumni who miss our CHIEF it is a great way to support the campaign to bring him back!
3.0,"I had some of the previous Browning socks that you used to get at hardware stores but these are different, not bad quality but it tighter around the ankles."
3.0,Came in great condition and leather smell but it's too bulky! I didn't want to return it so I gave it to a friend. It's as wide as a watch band.
3.0,The oil can needed to be a little larger to be a good prop with the costume.  When filled with water it leaked but I guess it was not supposed to be water tight.
3.0,There is a lot of material in the stomach area and I don't like that look. I also have large breasts and it fits well in that area but then you look down and the stomach area looks bad.
3.0,The $$$ and size is right and the colors are what I wanted BUT there is no BLACK.  I would have rather not had the white kerchief and had a black.  CAUTION:  The fabric is scratchy and coarse.  I purchased these kerchiefs for a Couples Western Night .  Would I purchase again?  I would have to give this considerable thought.
3.0,"the expandable bracelet stretched out the first time I wore it,"
3.0,"I really liked the light weight material,  but all the buttons were loose. Right out of the bag 2 fell off, a small matter I suppose I just hate sewing."
3.0,"I ordered this for my husband. He's 6'5 with a long torso and a belly so he typically wears XXL Talls. I'm always excited when I see talls available because they're so hard to find. That makes it even more frustrating when you find something that supposedly is his size only to have it be too small. When he tried it on it was skin tight and not quite long enough. He jokingly said that I could wear it (I'm 5'2) and for laughs I tried it on. But, it actually fits me really well as tunic length tee that's perfect with leggings. It's just a little oversized, but as a comfort tee for around the house it's perfect for me. 😂 It's comfortable and decent quality."
3.0,"Great price and fits wider, more muscular calfs. However the ankle is a bit baggy and bunches up."
3.0,"I love these pajamas, they are incredibly soft and comfortable, but they definitely run on the small size.  I ordered an XL since I am roughly a size 12/14 and they barely fit me.  I got these for Christmas and have already worn them.  If it wasnt for that, I would have re-ordered them in the larger size"
3.0,I like the design and it looks good on my wife but what is up with the green mark?
3.0,"It's rare to find a smaller minimalist wallet that meets all a person's individual needs.  Because of this simple point, only you can decide if this is right for you.  The benefits of this wallet is it's compact, durable, holds about 6-7 cards, and has a band for folded money.  The negative or concerns I've come to find are also the band and if it will hold up over time, the fit is too tight to have any card in a protective sleeve, and its simplistic design is so barebones basic that it's not very convenient.<br /><br />Update:<br />The elastic band has now begun to lose much of its elasticity and is fraying which is basically what I figured would happened so no surprise there.  I'm going to give Trayvex a try.  A few of their products offer a lot more features, more storage capacity, easy replacement part change-outs, and at a reasonable price.  I hold about 8 cards (license, LTC, 2 job cards, 2 credit cards, debit, and AAA) between personal and job related needs so this just doesn't cut it for me.  I think many people would find themselves in a similar boat.  However, there's nothing misleading about the product.  It will likely never break and the only worry is the band that will need replacing here-and-there for long term use.  Plus the band is always shifting and sometimes falls off which will lead to everything coming apart.  Good luck."
3.0,"Pretty but took several days and odor removing spray to air out and the one of the bottom hinges broke on the second use...the inside material did prevent me from losing my items. It was a tight fit for my Samsung Galaxy S9+ phone, chapstick, thin lipstick, ID and tipping dollars."
3.0,Have a hole in them 🥲
3.0,I had to wash it since it had a string smell to them like oil . But the material was as I expected. I could not complain since the price was cheep !
3.0,Item runs very big.  Need to return but I’ve already ordered in a smaller size.
3.0,"I saw this coming across my Vine feed and have always been curious about these gaiters with ear holes. I don't care to cover my ears with a regular gaiter unless it's cold, which isn't often here. So I decided to give it a try.<br />The color is nice, it looks a bit lighter in pictures, but it's actually a charcoal gray color. The length is good. There's enough to rest around the neck but not too much that it strangles you. The ear holes are just under the top hem, as high as they can be.<br />Putting on the gaiter, though, it feels like the top rim is sitting too high. It naturally falls right across the bottom of my eye and rubs along my eyelid. If I pull it down below that it pulls down on the top of my ear. Add to that, it's already very snug for a gaiter. A little snugness is good but this smashes my nose toward my face.<br />My wife tried it on and it fit her a little better but still sat fairly high on her face in the front.<br />Maybe this would be good for a person in their teens, or a petite lady, but I doubt I'll be wearing this for any length of time."
3.0,"Not full length as depicted and I am on the short side, 5'4. The fabric is nice though."
3.0,"I would size up or not buy. I am 135 pounds, 5 foot 4 and medium is very tight.<br />Adorable packaging though!"
3.0,Very thin wish it was thicker but was still decent
3.0,Cute pants but order a size up
3.0,The knot was a bit smaller than I pictured and the chain pulls my hair out at the base of my neck...
3.0,The back for the earring was not placed into the base well and came out.  Have to figure out how to make it stay on
3.0,Quality is meh. I was expecting better. Shirts are wide but have tight sleeves. Decent product but nothing worthwhile.
3.0,"The shirts fit very slim. My mom gave my daughter the Ariel/Belle/Jasmine set & bought 2 sizes too big (my daughter wears a 4t in most shirts) on purpose because my daughter is tall. The 6x is not loose on my 4 yr old who is a skinny kid.<br /><br />The shirt itself is soft but the image is THICK. You can see how the image holds wrinkles after a wash in my pic. It feels like cheap shirts from the 80's! Graphic t's have come a long way & this type of image printing is not it.<br /><br />All in all, they are wearable but we will get far less use from them because of the extra slim cut & image that will likely crack even though I'll dry it on delicate. Not thrilled & definitely took the other sets that were on the list for Christmas OFF! Meh, I could make my own iron on & get a better product!<br /><br />My daughter is 46 pounds & needs a 5t or a 6x for length in pants (we take up the waist)"
3.0,tarnished in two days......sad
3.0,Nice shoes. Just too small. I had to return and reorder.
3.0,Ok belt but not really sure if it will hold up over time. Will post a 6 month review on this belt.
3.0,The denim is great. However the size is way too big. I contacted the seller to exhange and haven’t heard anything back from them.
3.0,Ran a little large but nice material.
3.0,I got this and I’ve only used it for two days the second day I’ve had it the pompom  fell off my keychain disappointed of it
3.0,Not as pictured but came nicely packaged.
3.0,"Although the tag said this pair pants is 34W and 30L, it barely fit my waist. I am not sure if it is because of a different size system. I normally wear a 32 and would need a belt for 34. However, I could barely get this pair on. In addition, it wasn't advertised as slim fit but the lower leg is not designed for men with larger calves. My calves are on the larger side so the lower part of the pants were really tight (on my calves) to the point where it was skin tight for me. I like the style and overall look. The material feels good. For a pair with the correct, this would a good pair everyday pants (but the key is to get the right fit)."
3.0,Kinda small for a women's medium
3.0,It did not look anything like the one in the picture.  I was disappointed with the pattern that I was sent.<br />I gave it away as it would not have looked good on me.<br />As far as the Robe itself it was a bit smaller than the measurements said on the website.<br />It seemed to be made well though.
3.0,"These are somewhat poor quality. You have to be suuuuper careful putting these on as they tear so easily. They're also quite small. If you can manage to get them on without ripping, they're cute."
3.0,Bottom fit but too long for me at 5'4 &#34; . Top didnt fit couldnt close and I am smaller on top than. Material has no give.
3.0,"I got this for a layer shirt but if anyone is purchasing it to wear as-is, this shirt is see through. I like the style and fit just fine, the fabric feels a bit “loud” is that makes sense, but I would only recommend this if you are able to wear an extra layer under or over this top.<br />Hope this helps!"
3.0,all of the items are very small.  this seems like it is made for travel.  I was looking for something for frequent home use and this is not it.
3.0,After having the shirt for awhile it is starting to feel rough and it is very wide. It doesn't have holes or ripes and the stitching is still fully intact but the feeling of it makes it very hot to wear as well as itchy.
3.0,"The material doesn’t look like the photo. It’s lighter and not as shiny, and just doesn’t look good."
3.0,A chain made of spider's web would be sturdier.
3.0,"I purchased this to make it easier to switch backpacks (I change them weekly, sometimes daily) but it was too big for my mini backpacks, I ended up cutting the seams to take it apart and re-sew parts of it to a smaller size but it worked out."
3.0,"The onsie was a little big, but the pants were like MC Hammer pants. Way too big! The headband was also too big as well. My daughter only got to wear the onsie for her first thanksgiving. :("
3.0,Odd feel.
3.0,"Dress looks nice, cheaper fabric was used. Kind of like Dress Clothes. The outer layer of lace is ripping on the bottom of the dress, right out of the package. It's an easy fix for me cause I sew. Will work fine for the flower girl dress she is wearing it for, Price was Good!! Shipped Fast as well!"
3.0,"I bought this hat specifically because I have long hair and it was supposed to have a hole in the back to pull a ponytail through, it does not.  It's fine otherwise, but if you want to pull your hair through then get a different hat"
3.0,I expected a better fitting sock. They seem small and don’t cover my ankle like others I have had.
3.0,I like the dress but ordered the burgundy one and received the red. I would return it but I don’t have time as my package arrived almost a week late.
3.0,Zippers do not stay zipped.
3.0,These were the wrong size.  though I measured my glasses according to the dimensions given by the vender.
3.0,The leather is not that good
3.0,"The socks are beautiful and look just like the picture. They are very thin and run super small, better fit for a kid."
3.0,The earpieces were very short.  Hardly big enough to wear.
3.0,"Print is accurate, fits true to size, downside is material. The advertised picture is not the product; see picture. It is mostly polyester, not cotton as described."
3.0,"The first point I would like to make about these is that while they are very comfy I wouldn't call them yoga pants. They are great pants to wear around the house and potentially for a walk but any workout that would cause me to sweat I wouldn't wear these. The pants are cotton with an elasticity to them that makes them easy to pull on and keep on. I do have to keep adjusting the fold over top because it doesn't say in place very well but I can't tell if it is because they are a little bit big for me or if it is because of the material of the pants themselves. As for working out in them and doing a yoga workout, the biggest reason that i wouldn't, as I said, is the sweating. Almost all workout clothes these day care sweat wicking, meaning when you sweat it doesn't sit in your clothes and make you feel like you just jumped in the pool. My point is no one wants to sit in their own sweat and that's the purpose of sweat wicking workout clothes. If you are looking for a good pair of yoga pants for your next hot yoga class these aren't the pants for you. If you want a pair of light weight, comfy capri pants to wear around the house, do your housework or yard work than these are the pants for you.<br /><br />NOTE - I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

3.0,Chokers were too long.  I had to return them.  It would have been well worth the cost if they were a little smaller.
3.0,Top gave a weird lopsided boob look. Bottom was fine
3.0,I love it but the strings are annoying. The strings get wet every time I wash dishes and I have to keep it out of my food because obviously it touches every other surface during the day. Other than that it is beautiful. The strings also get knotted up and I have to fix or become too lose and have to tighten. Not sure I'd buy again
3.0,Super cute but somewhat thin.
3.0,Nice but quality is too cheap
3.0,super cute and very comfortable. The fabric is like what you'd like a swimsuit is made out of but is thick and stretchy. The only issue I had was the torso portion was way too short. The legs though were perfect for me and I usually wear jeans with inseams of 35&#34;<br />If you have a shorter torso and long legs then I would say this is a great product for you
3.0,Installed great but at full extension I will say a little too short
3.0,"It looks just like the picture, but it was too inflexible for me to wear. The seller was nice about the return."
3.0,Could possibly stick out of your nose
3.0,Leather watch band is very thin and stiff
3.0,Fits way to small. Normally 14/16 is big on my daughter....but this she can't even get it on its so tight
3.0,"It's very soft and comfortable.  Extremely long. Had to tie a knot at the bottom to kept from tripping on the hem.  I am 5'4"" and even with heels on it is a trip hazard.  The stitching in the straps and on the back came loose after a couple of washings.  I just wear it around the house now. Could have used better thread to sew small straps."
3.0,"I absolutely loved the dress, it's so pretty. I'm 5'6&#34; and 140lb. I ordered a medium but the dress didn't touch the ground, instead it came to my ankles. I was concerned that after a wash it would shrink and be even shorter. The belt was sown in on either side of the waist which means the belt didn't go all the way around like I expected it to. It is so pretty I was considering cutting off the cloth belt but that would probably look weird and look worse. Again, it is beautiful and comfy but due to those two things I'm sad to say that I am returning it."
3.0,Sound proof
3.0,Brim bent quite a bit more than I would of liked.
3.0,"These are pretty decent budget boxer briefs. The waist is a bit larger than other brands at the same size and they do stretch out quite a bit by the end of an active day, but they’re comfortable."
3.0,"My wife is a 36DD.  She said the large felt good and the X-large would have been to big.  The material is very comfortable.  My wife is used to shopping at Victoria’s Secret.  She thought the price was a little too high for this bra.<br /><br />Overall good quality, feel and style."
3.0,"If your kid is thin, this should be fine, but my son is kind of a husky (not fat, but a bigger, solid kid.) He's normally a size 10 just fine, but these shorts are really narrow in the waist.  The shirt looked fine.  The shorts also seemed a little cheap fabric-wise.  But it was nice enough, and if it fit, I would have kept it."
3.0,"It fits fine. I was hoping for more cushion. So if you don't need a cushioned slipper, this is a good product."
3.0,"The earring looks a bit different from the photo. It is silvery on the photo, but when I got the actual item, it is actually pretty metallic looking. It is not misty; it is clean and clear, and can see myself clearly through the reflection. However, it is still pretty. I just minus a star because it looks different from the picture.<br /><br />I minus'ed another star because it actually hurts... I wear clip-on earrings every single day since I have no piercings. I have all kinds of earrings, and my ears are so used to it that clip-on earrings never hurt me anymore. Yet, this one hurts. It is also rather heavy enough that when you walk, you will still notice the weight that it puts on the ears, even after a while.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this earring if you are new to clip-on earrings. This earring will definitely hurt your earlobes."
3.0,The side zip could be sewn in better. Does not zip up without some muscle...disappointed...I fear the dress wont hold up if or when the side zip malfunctions. Otherwise it is a cute dress
3.0,Once I tried to use with just a small wallet and iPhone it was heavy and cumbersome to get into.  It was very soft.  I may think about gifting the scarf.
3.0,"The fabric is very soft and cozy. However, the top is a little small. The pajama bottoms are a little large. This is strange since I normally wear a size XL, but was delivered an XXL. I will keep them, hoping that they may shrink in the wash."
3.0,It was great but it broke easy and I lost it :(
3.0,Overall the product is not bad. I bought this set because I love pink so I was most excited for that pair. It's more clear with a pink tint than actually pink though. They don't have an amber tint but seem to block some blue light.
3.0,Ideal for an evening wrap if you just want something over your arms.  But overpriced for what it is too.
3.0,They didn’t quite fit right so I gave them to somebody who they would fit on but would not buy again
3.0,"Decent jersey knit material. I'm 5'8&#34; and it was about 2 inches shorter than I'd like it to be. It fit fine otherwise, but I returned it since it was too short."
3.0,Cute pattern and color but the size and material weren’t right
3.0,"Got his for my husband as a gift.  It was waaaay too small for him, and he is a of average head size (maybe leaning toward smaller). This would work just fine for a petite woman or preteen.  I could see the cord being a bit annoying, and you need to have a battery source for it to work. Probably a good beginner ""electric hat"" to see if a person wants to get a better quality one down the road."
3.0,"I got a large because that's usually the size I get but it bit more like a medium. I'm 140 with 36Cs and a pretty round tummy, so if you have a similar body shape you'd better go up a size. I got the black color, too. It's well made for the price, nothing out of this world, but something sexy that adds a bit of interest under a cardigan. I'll probably be wearing this a lot this summer."
3.0,I really loved this purchase.  The only bad thing is that it runs a bit large so it keeps slipping off of my nose
3.0,Nice but way too small
3.0,Material is cheap and itchy
3.0,Really cute but super small and impossible to get the ball on for a tragus piercing
3.0,"I'm a healthcare worker who works in a clinic setting. I don't need wear straight over 8 hous daily fortunately. Only when I treat patients directly, I put it on my face. It is just heavy. I wish it were lighter and the hinges were flexible."
3.0,Little fuzzy on sides when looking straight ahead. Will take getting used to. But otherwise clear and type 2.50 works well for reading
3.0,A little scary in person
3.0,Very large on my 6 month old head.  I will hold on to it until she's able to fit it.
3.0,Was missing cuflink
3.0,Fits good. Have not worn out yet
3.0,"I let my 4 and 1/2 year old pick her swimsuit.  She wanted the pink and purple kittens.  I ordered the 4-5t.  It is cute but the fit is off.  The top fits right but the bottom is big and baggy.  I feel the legs are cut too high.<br />Probably have to cover it up with shorts.  The material is good and the design is cute though. My daughter really wants to keep it so we are going to make it work but if she didn't love it so much, I would return it."
3.0,"Material wasn't as thick as I had hoped. The masked finally arrived after 6 weeks.  Wanted i tfor a gag Christmas gift, was ordered on 12/1/20.  I'll still give it to them because they love the grinch."
3.0,"I just love this crossbody bag.  It’s the perfect size, and holds enough of my essentials.  Unfortunately, the metal loop that holds the lock broke on the top attachment.  I’m outside of my return window, but am sad that it is now broken.  Still love it, but wish I could replace it due to defect."
3.0,I have a fairly small head and this was too big. My head did not fill up the bucket part so it looked frumpy. The brim is too wide as well. Looked like good quality though
3.0,This is a bit gaudy and looks cheap.  The necklace part is confusing.  Easy clasp on the necklace and the shape of the earrings is great.  Would not gift.
3.0,This is wearable but I ordered a large and it seems i may be too tall because the sleeves don't really stay on my shoulders. lol<br />meaning the there's a dip in the back where your back shows but if you buy it too small it will fit small and the shirt will be in the middle of your back instead of the nape of it.
3.0,"The quality is not as good as I would expect for the price.  It is thin, so really is more for looks, versus warmth.  The hat appears to be much longer in the picture than it actually is.  I barely goes below her shoulders and she is only 10.  Her ball was barely hanging on by one string.  It was pulled off within a week.  I gave it 3 stars not for quality, but because she loves it and won't take it off much.  For quality, it maybe received a 2 stars."
3.0,Socks are for kids. they are a little small for a man with size 11 fet.
3.0,I've been wearing this band for 10 days. Nice weight to bands. It came with all the tools to remove links. But some of the rose gold is already rubbing off the band. I can tell it won't look nice for long.
3.0,Looks cheap too cheap to ever wear - maybe if you’re 5 years old. I donated it to the campus store.
3.0,It was a lot thinner material than I though it was going to be.  I don't look for it to be durable and lasting very long.  I was disappointed.
3.0,Smaller than what I expected but very cute gift for my sons teachers
3.0,It was ver nice for the price.
3.0,"I wish it was longer, but I am please with it."
3.0,Great material but I didn’t like the fit on my body.
3.0,The dress is cute but it is very thin material. It most likely will not last more than 2 or 3 washings. It is also see through so you can't really wear it to work unless you wear a cover up over it.  There are sturdier dresses similar to this one. I would look for those if you plan to wear this dress in public.
3.0,"The jacket was lined, which was nice for the price. The shoulder/chest/arm area was a bit tight. If you want to layer a thicker piece under, maybe size up."
3.0,The shirt is for a teenager. I bought this for a 12 year old girl who is very slender and tall. This is not for an adult. But she loved it and it looked great on her!
3.0,"These are fine to wear for casual use, but I don't think any sort of vigorous activity would work for these glasses.  They are too loose around the face.  The hinges are designed to be extended out (for larger faces and to prevent breaks) which is nice, but they should be a bit tighter."
3.0,"My mommy pooch is not that bad and this bathing suit really did nothing for that. The bottom was too big, the top too small. The fabric felt good and the cut and color are very cute. I just couldn't get on board with this suit."
3.0,quality seems good. After 3 weeks band keeps falling off my wrist. The catches seem to fatigue and releae
3.0,had it for less than a month and paint is wearing off
3.0,Skirt isn’t billowing.  Fitted at the hips.  Not like pictures.  Recommend going up a couple of sizes for a looser fit at the hips.
3.0,very thin material but cute
3.0,"Liked the material and cut and fit. However, due to fake buttons, I returned item."
3.0,"Product is very thin... Paper thin honestly and a bit over priced to be so thin, also runs very small."
3.0,I ordered a large and it is longer than I expected. I like the design even though the rank insignia is upside down for Marines (they are correct if Navy). It would be nice if that was corrected since that has been brought to my attention several times now. I think it is overpriced
3.0,"My 5 year old loved them. Unfortunately the string broke with first wear. Also, it does not come with the underwear netting that swim trunks normally come with."
3.0,Nice rings but there just all to small of sizes
3.0,"I was very excited to see this item had an adjustable size because it was very tiny, but since the ring is varying in size throughout, it didn’t hold up and the ends snapped off pretty easily. I was disappointed but the ring itself is still good quality. I use it on a shelf for display now and it still looks pretty good, I just wish it didn’t break."
3.0,"I was disappointed by the length. And the  o rings were put together, with clasp dangling, making it unable to put on over head. Had to fix before I could wear."
3.0,Very cute but very cheap!
3.0,"I have ordered three pairs as they a cheap, better quality than REALLY cheap at Walgreens. But each pair - the quality is different. They all seem hard to keep clean. One pair has a &#34;cloudy&#34; film on it. Not bad. Functional. For #11 you get what you pay for."
3.0,Every single time I bend over they roll up at the thighs. Extremely annoying.
3.0,I am 5’7 and 155 ordered a large and it hits so that my butt is showing. I gave it to my daughter who is 5’4 and 120 (usually a women’s small or casual) I’ve ordered a 2x so we will see if this one fits. The material is light the print is gorgeous. Just hoping the larger size will be long enough..
3.0,I like the grahic print...just didn't like the fit 4 the size I chose!
3.0,Order a size up! I ordered my normal size and they fit EXCEPT they didn't cover my entire rear end - my crack was showing. The rest of the pants fit great but if you have an apple bottom and don't want anything showing then go a size up. I sent mine back and am now ordering a size up.
3.0,I thought this would be twice smaller. The stone looks plastic and had scratches when I received it. Not what I was expecting.
3.0,I was given a sliver one not black. Looks and feels nice.
3.0,Not heavy enough but it could be worse
3.0,"These are so pretty, But I am so disappointed that the rods are so thick that they won't even go thru the holes in my ears...So unable to wear them, can't get them thru my piercings."
3.0,"Had to return it. Way too small, and the dark strips were dark blue, not gray."
3.0,"The only problem I have is that the sleeves are too short.I got a size bigger than usual,but I should have gotten 2.I'm a female and these are men's sizes,so men you may want to definitely get larger than usual sizes for yourselves. Otherwise it's a nice jacket.I haven't worn it in the rain yet so I can't say much about that."
3.0,"I like the concept of this belt buckle. However, it is too large to thread through belt loops on regular pants. It may work on bdu pants, though I haven't tried it yet. The belt itself is not as stiff as I had hoped. All in all, I will keep it."
3.0,"Personally the coin holder leather is sturdy but the plastic cover quickly separated after 2 days, super bummed about it."
3.0,"Not exactly what I expected. Zipper is awkward, doesn't hold much. Forget about it holding a cell phone."
3.0,Nice looking bracelet but the description says it's 8&#34; and it's not.
3.0,The loops break off very easily.
3.0,No padding but still a cute swim top
3.0,Good fir fircist
3.0,"I bought one of these for my son on his birthday in the gunmetal gray color and was impressed with the wallet.  I had another cheaper minimal wallet that had stretched out over time so I decided to buy one of these for myself.  I went with the copper finish because it looked a little more upscale and adult than just the black or gray color.  I wish I had gone with those instead.  I expected some patina because its copper but I did not expect the amount of scratches and wear on the color as I got.  In some spots that you can see in the picture there are just bare spots where it has just rubbed off the color.  I keep this in my front pocket with my keys occasionally but not all the time.  After I noticed some scratches I stopped putting them in the same pocket together and I am still seeing rub spots.  My sons on the other hand gets used just as much if not more, and more abuse from a teenager, and his gunmetal gray version is still in pristine condition, even being 2months older.  While I will recommend this because overall the quality of both seem to be superior to 2 other brands I have owned, I would not recommend the copper finish.  The packaging is impressive and seems they did not spare expense on the product or the packaging so I would have expected a little more durability on the finish."
3.0,"Well I just got the set, looks good, only problem is the 24in piece had a tear I. The exterior zipper, contacted amazon and they immediately refunded me for that piece, I was able to restitch  the zipper to the ABS with upholstery tread and a very strong needle , with pliers, now I know that’s not optimal for everyone, but I’m leaving shortly for the DR, and need the set, I’m hoping Fochier will see this review and offer to replace the piece, but we’ll see, hopefully the rest of the pieces will hold up with the as always gentle airport luggage carriers😜 I’ve attached a picture or 2 of the zipper area, March 27th just got back from vacation, the night  before we left we had to safety pin the zipper linner of the large suitcase, because it tore apart during packing, and on the way back from our vacation the exterior seem on the carry on, was giving way, just like the 24 in piece going to ask for a full refund"
3.0,This was way smaller than expected.  I had to return it as it hardly fit my son.
3.0,This necklace is very small.  It's not as pretty in appearance as it was on the website.  Thinking about returning it and the earrings too.
3.0,"Nice dress, I just didn't like how it fit on me."
3.0,Cute dress but way too big. I ordered a size small. And it was falling off of me.
3.0,"When I bought these, they where 12 bucks, acceptable at that price, but I wouldn't pay more.<br />These are pretty much disposable"
3.0,"It is plainer than the picture gives it credit for, but it's a nice little dress for the price."
3.0,The colors are nice the qualities is lousy
3.0,So the sweater itself is not too bad its thin not great sweatshirt material took forever but the seller was very nice and did refund me some of the cost the design on the front is a transfer and will wash off /fade very easily I wish it was a screenprint or sublimation  my daughter loves MHA so thats all that matters
3.0,It's ok but just not as flattering as I wold like. Too much of a bag look. Comfortable.
3.0,I thought these were so cute. The lanyard attachments make it easy to attach to a mask. However the reason I purchased these lanyards specifically was for the cute little animals for my kindergartener. Unfortunately the little animal heads easily pop off their attachment to the lanyard (which appears to be glue?). I could have bought any lanyards on amazon for a better deal if i had known this. So if you want lanyards and animal heads that pop off- this is what you should buy.
3.0,A little big but ok . Washes up well.
3.0,"Discolored rubber panels underneath the design. Not too noticeable but since it’s for an Apple watch that’s waterproof, it should be waterproof too. I think it got discolored while washing dishes. Apple Watch is fine!  Solved problem by peeling off the panels and it still looks great."
3.0,"I knew I would have to put them together after reading the reviews, but the elastic wasn't of good quality. Adults couldn't fit in them and the kids just tore them apart. Unless you super tape them, they're not worth it for the kids."
3.0,"esta mas grande de lo que esperaba , la tela muy suave"
3.0,The bands seem very durable but they are way to narrow for my taste. Better suited for a woman's arm I think. The photo is very deceiving.
3.0,"I got this Lingerie for Women Lace Bodysuit Teddy One Piece Babydoll and disappointed because it is very  uncomfortable and not easy to put it on and take it off coz if imagine you want to go to bathroom you have to take all your outfit .and its see through , you cant just wear it like that need to cover inside your nips."
3.0,"Thin material, and fit a bit smaller than I expected it to. If I’m showing off that much cleavage and possibly some under boob, I just expected a looser fit."
3.0,"Not impressed. The material is very strange. Abrasive on the skin. DO NOT wash in washer machine. It now has all sorts of lint and clotted cloth all over, that woon't come off unless shaved off or plucked off. Very boxy design. Not flattering."
3.0,"The picture implies there are pockets, which was the main reason I bought these. They fit fine, but I wish they had pockets"
3.0,"The earrings are fine. They look as pictured, but extremely flimsy and break easily. A few pairs I wasn’t even able to wear because they broke beforehand. If you’re looking for quantity, they are fine for a couple uses (hopefully) . If you’re looking for quality, seek elsewhere."
3.0,"So I bought the LG/XL and I loved them, but they were a little snug on my thunder thighs so I  bought the 2XL and the LG/XL fit better then the 2XL.. so  the sizes are off, Kinda sad not gonna lie"
3.0,The &#34;wide&#34; size wasn't. It seemed to be well made however.
3.0,"I find this dress very comfortable! The pockets are an added bonus. The only issue is that it doesn't flatter my body type well. The size fits, but it doesn't fall well. I have a little bit of a belly, and this dress accents it rather than hides it. I think the elastic band falls at the wrong place for someone my body type."
3.0,"So far, so good.  This waist-trainer fits as indicated.  Am working with it, as we speak, to see how well it helps with Weight Loss Body Shaping."
3.0,The size fits up top but I don't like the bottom a little tighter in the thigh which causes it to flare a little too much at the bottom. It will work for those who love bootcut style...with jeans I don't mind but not for the look I was going for with this jumpsuit. Perhaps it's the fabric it's very thick. However I do like the style but I'll be returning it.
3.0,This is a great item for comfort. Super comfortable and quick application and the watch doesn't fall off. Downside it is not durable and is falling apart after less than five months.
3.0,"True to image it is a bit silky which is fine and sizing seem right but the buttons are not secured very well and one feel off the second time I wore it, I sewed back on and secured the rest. Still love the shirt but expect to secure the buttons."
3.0,"The dove is  as pictured and as expected. I like it a lot. However, the chain is somewhat cheap, so I had to buy another chain.  On a better chain, the dove  looks great.  Consider that you are paying for the dove, and the chain is a freebie. If you know what I mean!"
3.0,"This is a VERY cute dress- I absolutely love it and I was able to get it on and zip it up, but the fit was very tight and clingy. It has some nice stretch, but the fabric creases and rides up because of the extremely tight fit. The color was a really nice, bright red and the mermaid hem was beautiful. For the price, it’s a steal, and I was hoping to exchange it for the next size up...<br /><br />... but I bought the largest size (L). For reference, I am 5’6” and 155 lbs. I have a 36” bust and a 30” waist. I am an 8 in dresses (sometimes a 6) and a M in tops. While I could stand to lose 5-10 lbs, I am by no means fat and am fairly athletic. Given that, the fact that this only goes up to a L is a let down.<br /><br />Last note - the dress itself does not have a L tag on the inside, but I’m assuming that it was in fact a L as ordered."
3.0,"these were a bit too heavy for me and I returned them.  they looked nice, just too heavy for me."
3.0,I’m torn with these slip in shoes.  At first they were very comfortable.  I like that I can slip them in and run out to the yard or in the basement.  My issue is that a I found my feet sliding in them.  My big toe had a little callous on it from trying to keep these on my feet. Perhaps it’s because they fit both men and women.
3.0,Quality product but the flower bud is much bigger than I expected.
3.0,Fits good but the fabric kind of stained my skin.
3.0,Although the quality of the product is fine and they fit great they are not a true black. They are almost a smoke grey. The fit was great and they stay up and are not see through. I just wish they were a true black.
3.0,"far too tight, could not zip them over calves. I dont have that large of calves but its nearly impossible for me."
3.0,It was ok. The shirt ran big and also did not have a front or back.
3.0,"It's CRAZY, I got the gray and light blue, the light blue fit perfectly!! The gray sit on my hips like low riders, so when I sit down my backside is showing 😢 I was going to get more but not worth the risk!!"
3.0,"Really cute bonnets but not at all breathable.  Good for plopping or roller setting, not good for sleeping in if you want something breathable this is not it"
3.0,Pretty lace...a little large..
3.0,The shirt looked cute in the image but I was a bit disappointed with the materail and the fit. I sent it back. 😒
3.0,It's itchy. But I have sensitive skin. Too hot fabric. And I buy stretchy sleeves are long but I'm short. I love the color and the buttons dress it up a bit
3.0,"I liked the style of the glasses but I returned. Even after I cleaned the lenses, they were still foggy to look through."
3.0,"The material was very stiff, not flowy enough to wear with leggings in my opinion.  I am 5'9 so for me it was way too short to wear without pants."
3.0,"Great idea for bracelets but I received the gray one when I thought it was black.  Don't like the gray color but neat idea for changing out the snaps.  Snaps stay in place, no worry about them falling out."
3.0,IF YOU ARE TALL THIS IS MORE LIKE A LONG SHIRT....WHICH WAS OK WITH ME.  ARM'S SEEM TO BE A BIT SMALL AND WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AT FIRST BUT I WAS ABLE TO STRETCH THEM OUT A LITTLE.  YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET.
3.0,Buttons looked different. Material looked cheap.
3.0,Son baratos pero la mayoría se empiezan a despintar y te dejan el oyó de la oreja de color negro
3.0,"Very good looking mask.... Except, the picture is deceiving. This mask covers very little of your face. It is 3 inches from covering to my ear. Covers about the same as a &#34; Jason &#34; mask. Only looks good from straight on.  Needs to be worn with a hoodie to make this mask wearable."
3.0,"This dress was really cute, and it fit well except for the fact that it was sooo short. There was no way this was going to work. I'm 5'7 and it barely covered my butt."
3.0,was too short
3.0,I loved the earrings. However they were a tad not comfortable on my ears
3.0,"I bought this product with high expectations, but it is not that great. It is made of a material that makes the skin hot. It is not as flattening as it shows in the picture either (and i am not out of shape). I wear size 8 and am 5'4'', the product fitted but as I said, it is missing something to be attractive and sexy."
3.0,It is a nice necklace but very small more like for kids not adults.
3.0,Love the design. Not too great for big calves.
3.0,"I got this because I'm a freemason and a patriot. The design displays both. It also looked cool with ear cut outs. In my case, the ear cutouts made it uncomfortable and not fitting. Also the design is barely visible and gets lost in scrunched up material on the next. The quality is good and why I gave it 3 stars but it isn't comfortable using the ear cut-outs and the design can barely seen to those around you."
3.0,The part that clamps the top to your ear edge pinches pretty severely when it isn't slipping off altogether.  Got a lot of compliments on it.
3.0,What you’d expect for cheap.
3.0,"Perfect fit postpartum: I was 2 months postpartum after my 2nd child and still looked pregnant. With a wedding to attend I ordered dresses each over $100 from major department stores and online fashion houses, but I still looked pregnant in every one. But not this dress!! It was cut perfectly and flared in just the right way so that any poof looked like dress and not my belly. I received tons of compliments with how great I looked after so recently having a baby.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars? The lace overlay is very fragile. In fact mine arrived with a hole in it but I didn't realize in time to exchange so I spent a long time attempting to mend it. I made it so you don't notice it immediately but there was no way to repair it, so I'll probably not wear it again. It also snagged on many things throughout the night which was a little stressful. But I sure was thankful to have found it, and for less than a quarter of the price of the other dresses I'd tried!"
3.0,"These look nice, my husband really loved them, and they fit his face nicely but they broke within a month even with careful handling. We won't buy again."
3.0,"The fabric looks a tad cheap, not my favorite dress."
3.0,"Loved the color,  but way too big. Is order ay least 2 sizes smaller."
3.0,I bought this for my Grandaughter ordered 1size bigger and the shirt fit but pants were short
3.0,Great fit but noisy
3.0,"This dress fitted a bit tight and was not as flattering as I had hoped.  Unfortunately, the dress was returned.<br /><br />The Good:  The color is nice, not as bright as photoed.  The material is decent and the dress appeared well made.<br /><br />The Not-So-Good:  The dress fits tightly and was not flattering on the body.  If you wanted a brighter blue, this is not the dress...  Mine was more navy.<br /><br />Overall:  I am not a big fan of this dress, but it appears well enough made."
3.0,I really love this ring but the stones are falling off kinda disappointed
3.0,"Material seems a little cheap, and my regular size came out huge on me, so it really feels like a tent. But I think it will be nice for hanging out at home this summer."
3.0,Did not like the material.!! Too clingy...
3.0,I love this leggings so much but they're not as well made as I would like. I ended up getting a hole the first week I had them. It wasn't even a seem. Just a hole in the middle of the fabric. The seems themselves are very well in forced but the material is not very strong at all. You will have to decide for yourself if it is worth the money. I still wear mine but I have had to patch them a couple times.<br />&#34;A penny saved is a penny earned.&#34; - Benjamin Franklin.
3.0,"In three months, my daughter has worn these slippers more or less constantly, and they are falling apart. She loves them, and I was going to replace them with a new pair, but now they are $13 instead of $10, and I'd honestly like something that isn't going to be falling apart and losing thread, ripped sole and look like dirty torn rag in three months. Fur lined has to be a joke, it's all polyester, no fur at all."
3.0,"The body fits well. I like that it is tight without being constrictive. My only issue is with the cups. I’m a 32D and they are a bit too big. Not so big to stop me from wearing it, but big enough that I’m careful of my boobs not falling out. I’m glad I got the suit, but if was available in small I would have got it."
3.0,It's ok but looks nothing like the picture.  It is well made but i am a bit disappointed.
3.0,Too big 4 me
3.0,"I actually really like this dress, but it's more a beach cover up in my opinion than it is a dress.  I bought it in both Med/ Large and will say that it runs big. I probably need a small.  The material is a gauze like material with nice embroidery but I wasn't expecting it to be so sheer  / beachy.  If that's what you are looking for it could be a good choice,  but it's not what I wanted so it will be going back.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5’4 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28” waist 34” and ordered this in  Black/ medium. I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.<br />I paid full price for this item and wasn't compensated in any way but would appreciate a &#34;yes&#34; click if you found my review helpful :)"
3.0,"The sizing chart was way off, shirt was way to small."
3.0,Fits a little weird at the top. If you wear a blazer it’s fine but right at the armpit area it bunches. Material feels on the cheaper side
3.0,"I love the shirt, but the seams came out the first day I wore it. Had to have the seems redone."
3.0,It’s cute but very short not recommended for anyone who wears a size medium and up.
3.0,"Thick material and feels comfy, not see thru but it had a ripped thread that snagged all the way down the front :(<br />Still a cute top. I was hoping the red was darker towards burgundy but it’s more orange. It’s long but tucks in easy. A weird length to not tuck it in."
3.0,I like the design not the fabric
3.0,Too big for my face but cute
3.0,"Bad product description, dress isn't fitted as shown in picture, is actually a-line and very short.  Dress got wider as size went up, not longer! I like material though! Wish that it was the same as in the picture."
3.0,"Nice, but glad I ordered a size up. Runs small."
3.0,"There is no clip to adjust the strap, thus I had to pin the straps for the leotard to fit my daughter. But the overall look is as expected after I pin the straps and my daughter likes the look of it."
3.0,Fits smaller than expected AND I sized up. Arms are very slim and restrict motion. Seams are terrible and it’s very poorly sewn. fabric is thin and almost see through
3.0,"Cute pants, but weren’t as I expected. They stick together very easily and aren’t comfortable."
3.0,"The material is soft denim. Its the type of &#34;denim&#34; you would expect for the price. However, its somewhat loose around the armpits. When i say loose I mean that the shoulder area that goes down to the breast does not fit flat on your chest area, it is very loose with a puffy look. It was also a bit long. However, I cut had mine cut and it was ok.<br />All in all, it didn't fit as I expected it to.<br />BTW, I'm 5'4'' and 132lbs and I ordered small."
3.0,"Hmmmm. I loved these socks out of the plastic bag. We originally got the medium - toddler wears a size 10. They looked huge so we returned them for the small. Bad idea. One cycle through the wash and dryer, and these socks are now probably too small for even my newborn. They shrink. Big time. Order a size up, wash them and you should be good. Here’s a picture of a small after ONE wash."
3.0,"It’s very cute, I had it on my backpack for 2 months and it broke."
3.0,"Much flatter than pic seems. Not as real looking, but for the price it's not too bad."
3.0,I ordered two sets of 50 piece hardware.  Both bags had only 40 so now my project is delayed and I've had to order more!  Unhappy.
3.0,It is not exactly as depicted in the photo.  The Yin Yang symbol is not darker but uniformly silver with the rest and thus indistinguishable.
3.0,"Ordered an xl they sent me a small. I’ll just give it to my granddaughter instead of the hassle of returning it. It’s a cute shirt, may order one in my size and hope I actually get it this time."
3.0,It kind of looks like the picture but does not really mimic the Stargate portal as I had hoped. It is more like a nice bauble.
3.0,The collar & sleeves were so big.
3.0,No where near 42” belt. Poor quality.
3.0,The snap closure is weak and pops open too easily.
3.0,Just like picture. Old school Hue leggings. Nothing special.
3.0,"I actually do like them.  They are comfortable, but not flattering and really long if you're short (5ft they go past my knees).  I don't mind the boyish design since I am a T-Shirt and jeans kind of gal.  The worst thing is the smell.  Currently washing them to see if it goes away.  The smell alone got them the 3 stars."
3.0,"Too small, doesn't fit a normal 3xl"
3.0,The sizing wasn’t true
3.0,Shirt fits great and accurate to standard sizing. It’s more casual than I expected and kind of looks like a sleep shirt. I don’t love how the bottom of the seems on the sides flare out but very comfortable. I ordered a 2X
3.0,"Bag was ok but the color was funky looking.  Not red, not pink.  I returned it in favor of a different bag."
3.0,"Great fit, but thought it was more of a mauve/pink tone. It's brown, I sent it back."
3.0,"faded very quickly and broke within the first week.....we rigged it to work with duct tape and screws, but it is only good for one season at most. The concept is great though...."
3.0,This ring is pretty in person but it’s a bit cheap looking. Bought as a gift but IMO not giftable. Purchased on sale but even at that price I over paid for costume Jewelry. Definitely not worth over $5
3.0,It's okay.  A little heavy.
3.0,We returned the 40 DD because it wad slightly large in the cups and loose around her.<br />Ordered the 38 D and it wouldn't go around her and the cups were much smaller.<br /><br />Disappointing since this is a VERY pretty and sexy set.
3.0,It doesn't stay straight so the ears get all weird when you wear it.
3.0,Short boxy fit
3.0,"Nice fit but the crotch is too long for me.  I'm 5'8' with 28"" inseam.  Legs bind too much for any athletic endeavor."
3.0,"These are nice earrings.  The color is good, the size is perfect for the third hole in my ears.  The problem is they are immitation amber.  Not rea, amber as advertised.  They were inexpensive so I'm still going to keep them, but people should know it's not genuine amber."
3.0,I lost one of my screw backs the first time trying to put it on. So sad I can't wear them.
3.0,I ordered a 2XL and this fits my daughter who wears between and Med and a Lg
3.0,"The quality is not what I expected, I wanted something soft, but it was unpleasant"
3.0,"I was so excited about ordering this dress. It is just as pictured, very cute colors and a really great style. I read up on other products to get the right size. So disappointed when it came in and was entirely too large. I contemplated ordering the smallest size, but considering the size difference, I did not think it would be enough. Such an adorable piece if only it would fit."
3.0,Was happy with the 2 but the heart one is not that color and heart is bout time fall off.
3.0,"The fabric is more like leggings than actual pants. It also runs tight, and the pant legs are long and drag on the floor. (Please note I am a long legged person to begin with) I mean that's not too much of an issue you can hem it up if you have the skills to do so. But for the price you pay it's a decent product."
3.0,"Ordered a Medium and my 16yr old is now the owner of this outfit lol super cute, but wow looked like toddler clothes"
3.0,It broke the second I tried to put it on my son.
3.0,They are cute but there is no closure at the top to keep the chapstick from falling out. If the material at top had a flap it would be protective. The chapstick sticks out just a bit so falls out easily into my purse
3.0,This was a gift for my daughter.  She loved the design and said the pants were great but the top was too small for comfortable sleep wear.
3.0,"Not particularly happy about this one. After wearing for less than one week, the strap has pulled apart.<br /><br />It has a great look that I was very happy with. It just did not hold up to use. While I have fixed it by reattaching the strap to the metal retainer with some compression and hot glue, I’m afraid it’s going to come loose again at a not so good time damaging my watch…."
3.0,"I got these and we're super excited they look just like the picture, the cost was perfect!!! The only thing is I'm a 34C and the top could have been a small, and the button a large!!!! But I'll make it work! It's a cute lil number and my hubby loves it!"
3.0,Good strap but the metal guides are a bit oversized relative to 18 mm strap I bought.
3.0,Love Mona lisa jewelry
3.0,Did not look like picture at all. It was cheap and an ugly red
3.0,"These bike shorts are adequate for the riding that I do. They fit nicely and fit to size. They are lighter weight fabric than my last pair, so I am not certain how long they will hold up, but they also cost much less than my last pair. Good price and a nice color (I bought the blur pair)"
3.0,"This dress fits great and the top of it is beautifully made! .. now the bottom is thin and is made of a stretchy fabric like yoga pants, it highlights every imperfection on the body, it has to be made with a thicker material.<br />I feel like a sausage stuffed  in a tight casing.<br />Will be returning.<br />I al 5’10 and wear size 16"
3.0,"Short, returned"
3.0,"I ordered large and it is still snug (I usually wear small to medium US size). Fitting is fine. There are three layer. The outer two layer which are a little rougher than I expected and the inside breathable lining.<br />The sewing is uneven and does not speak quality. Also, While you cannot see it in the pics, there is baby blue band in the back -- I only wanted and red and white.For the small price tag, I think it is probably worth it."
3.0,"As other reviewers indicated, it doesn't seem like a genuine Coach bag. The lining is wrong and the leather is quite thin for Coach. Buyer beware."
3.0,I received this swimsuit only the find elastic in the rear end was stretched out.
3.0,"Too small, i buy 2xl this is too small,"
3.0,Look great. I didn't realize that these didn't automatically come with a buckle. Now I can't wear it yet.
3.0,Love this outfit buuut the top is to small and the pants were to big.
3.0,"The quality of this dress was pretty bad, but it worked great for the wedding I attended. The cut of the dress was nowhere near as flowy as the product photos but I actually liked the tighter fit of the dress I received. The fabric wasn’t very nice though."
3.0,"I'm 5'8, 220 lbs... ordered XL<br />Too small, order one size up.<br />Pockets are also small, but will fit keys, not a phone."
3.0,Very cute dress. It fit great- it was just way too short for me.
3.0,ok but balls keep breaking have to keep putting new ones in but great price for 100 though
3.0,"I had to search and search for a replacement to the jacket that was stolen. I love this jacket, but the thumb holes are nearly in the opposite side of hand. I bought this to wear riding, thumb hole needed… sucks they can’t be utilized…"
3.0,"My sister asked me to order this for her for a concert that she was attending.  She was disappointed in the color of the scarf.  While the description and even the packaging says &#34;white&#34;, it is beige in color and the skulls are brown in color. If you are looking for a white background with black skulls color scheme, this is not the scarf for you.<br /><br />If I could rate 1/2 stars, this would be about a 2.5 star entry just because of the color issues."
3.0,Good wallet! I like it but the clip that holds money gets weak.
3.0,very strong glasses- work well though!
3.0,I'm 125lbs ordered a small it fit right
3.0,"Wore this dress to a wedding at 32 weeks pregnant. It fit ok. The openings for nursing are huge and at times exposed my belly/torso because the fabric is so stretchy. Love the color and how soft it is! Also the length is perfect, just below the knee. I was 5'8"" 150lbs at the time."
3.0,I returned this hat. Wanted a knit hat with smaller/shorter visor. Too much like a baseball cap.
3.0,My son loves this outfit but it’s definitely larger than the size listed and the material is cheap. We kept it because it’s his favorite but I can’t fathom it being super comfortable.
3.0,fit really small
3.0,"The lens colors everything a slight off green color and the nose pinches a little, but I have a larger head than most so that is something only relevant to a few. Feels like it would be sold in a Target, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It does it's job and you get what you pay for."
3.0,"lovely dress.  didn't fit as described.  while it fit around the waste, the area around the bust was way to snug and tight.  Returned"
3.0,But it one size bigger because will shrink after the first wash
3.0,It’s a bit of a thin material. I wore it over a bathing suit instead as a regular dress. I bought a large following the size guide and it’s an A line dress so it’s big.
3.0,"Good quality hat, but 1 size never fits All.  It was a little too tight for me."
3.0,Its came a bit larger then expected and MUCH longer then expected.. Its longer then my arms by far. Will have to get tailored just to wear it
3.0,Pretty! Trendy!
3.0,Nice wrap but needs more beads in the middle that retain the cold water.
3.0,"Beautiful embroidery, but not crazy about the fabric."
3.0,This dress is well made from lovely fabric but I had to return it as it was much too large.
3.0,These are simple earrings but low wight and would be better to wear them with matching pearl collants. They don't seem so precious but good enough for a normal ceremonies or evening parties.
3.0,"Looks neat. Not exactly high quality. My last one started corroding and rusting just from skin contact after a couple of months. This one is a replacement, but it arrived with a dead battery."
3.0,The pants arrived late but at least they got here. They looked a lot different than the picture. The patchwork pockets are almost the same shade of black as the pants and they are a different fabric than I had anticipated. Sort of a matte cotton blend? They fit well but from the reviews I had read I was expecting them to run small. The pair I received is a small and started to get a little baggy after about two hours of wear. Good for an average pair of pants to walk around in. Not as cool looking as the picture.
3.0,"The hat is functional, but not stylish. It also runs a bit large. Not my favorite sun hat."
3.0,"Very cute dress and fit pretty true to size.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the style on my body shape, so I'll be returning it."
3.0,"These ties look a little different than the photo, but are still decent looking ties. The issue I have with them is that they're not great quality. If you need a quick tie in a pinch, or are working in an office where jobs require a tie but you're entry level, this would work for you. They're obviously not quality from just a glance, so not great for formal or for a job where you need to look your best."
3.0,not the right fit but I could be fatter than assumed.
3.0,I needed - 200 as pictured in photo . Clearly states glasses are - 500.  My mistake
3.0,"They are okay but they would be better if the wrist holes would actually stretch some. Except for those wrists areas, they are actually comfortable."
3.0,Cute dress. Very summery and flowy
3.0,Very nice quality but my hubby is only 5’11 with super skinny legs and these do not go over the calf
3.0,I had to return it as it was much larger than I expected.
3.0,"In my opinion, it runs large. The item I received looked like the picture but it was obvious it was a cheaper version because the quality of the material was subpar. High low cut on the lower hem was more awkward looking in real life than on the model. 3 stars I suppose because it was similar to photo which is always a gamble on amazon when it comes to apparel. Could have rated lower because I personally didn't like it but it doesn't mean it won't work for others."
3.0,"The dress fit well and it's very pretty. However, the material is low quality and the lining is fairly thin. The zipper in the back wasn't completely sewn in but could easily be fixed. It looks nice but wasn't really what I was looking for to wear to a formal work event."
3.0,When you sit down it rides up very high up the thigh
3.0,I'm a bit disappointed in the quality but it is costume jewelry. It just looks really fake like toy jewelry. I wouldn't give this to anyone except for maybe children and there are a few pieces that are fairly decent but it's like dollar store quality.
3.0,Was expecting a better fit. It's soft and nice though.
3.0,Order a size larger and you'll be happy.
3.0,"The material was a lot tighter fitting than expected, and the sizes run a little small! I bought it to put a monogram on the pocket for the 4th of July, that worked out great! Just make sure to size up!"
3.0,"Ok so I have super sensitive ears and basically never wear earrings, I bought these to try with post earrings.  They slide on fairly well, but when I tried to but the in my ears, the post is extra thick which made it hurt.  If your ears holes are big then they would work good."
3.0,I didn't know that it was going to be so small.... but it is very well made
3.0,"Drawstring is ivory, not black.  Yes, it matters."
3.0,Cute but multiple showed up bent
3.0,Dress was too big for me and I had a lot of trouble with the the bow belt.  Dress was of good quality and it may be perfect for someone else.
3.0,"Looked okay, though posts were rather frail and had to be careful as they bent just taking off the packaging.  Agree with one viewer who mentioned the posts are short.  They fit fine, but unbeknownst to me, one earring fell out, which defeats the purpose of me spending the money for the trio set. Wouldn't buy again."
3.0,This was a bit large so doesn't fit as I expected
3.0,"Mine were scratched and not in a proper case when I got them. So I sent them back. But I love these glasses, and I will definitely want a replacement."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:948c1ace26b5f71eb72bc0e1527c07a7]] I wish I had a picture but like other reviews it is slightly difficult to get them apart. Some of the hats has holes in the brim. The holes were small and almost unnoticeable but that's why I gave 3 stars. The size is too big for 6-7 year Olds. I just attached a strap to keep it on their heads.
3.0,I like the style and the fit but  these 'brown' glasses are black.
3.0,Tengo 185 libras la e comprado XXl para que pueda quedarme y llego descosida
3.0,I didn’t like how much cleavage is shown. Loved the weight and feel of fabric. Well made dress. Color and pattern matched with phot on line.
3.0,Material is very thin and the shirt runs about 2 sizes small
3.0,Cute dress but was too small
3.0,It has a better clasp tha the 1st one I had
3.0,The bracelet is very pretty and glistens in the sunlight.  The color is way to rose for a rose gold.  It ends up looking almost like rust.
3.0,"I love the jacket and the material. It does run extremely small, I got a large and it fit perfectly. My only critique is that I wore the jacket one time and the zipper broke off."
3.0,The ring is beautiful but it's starting to fade the silver part
3.0,Cheap broke after one use
3.0,The photo size looked smaller yet the tag is pretty big.. you may get something engraved in it. The only thing is the chain which doesnt get along with any chest-hair.
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty in the advertisement, but in person, they're a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />These earrings are nearly two inches long, and an inch in width at the largest point. They're heavy on the ears, but not to the point of stretching, and they're sparkly under a flashlight, very glittery, and from a distance, they're not half-bad.<br /><br />However, the rhinestones are glued on using a cheap adhesive, and the glue hasn't cured, if it was ever meant to. Because of this, the rhinestones can be pushed around, and the earrings get locked into weird positions and have to be pried apart with very little effort. If you have long hair, it will get stuck to the earrings and leave residue on your strands.<br /><br />Overall I think the earrings would've been better off not having rhinestones at all. I think I'll just remove them and the leftover glue, see if that makes them more wearable."
3.0,"Most are okay, but the few that are a weird faux leather have really bad kinks in the material from shipping. But overall not a bad product for the price. Can definitely buy some other hardware to spice them up a bit though."
3.0,"I'm only giving this coat three stars because apparently it was used. That is not stated anywhere. There was a candy cane and an empty wrapper in the pocket of the outside coat. It appears to be in good shape, didn't see any problems. I'm just a little annoyed that I wasn't informed it had been worn and used and also wondering why I paid full price for a used item.<br />Also the coat cane stuffed into a box that was too small and was barely closed by the tape. It was so full they put an extra piece of cardboard over the top to make sure it was covered since the box wouldn't close right. I wouldn't care so much about that except that it made the coat pretty wrinkled when I pulled it out.<br />As far as the coat itself, it's a very nice coat! Very warm, the inner lining is bright and pretty. It has a lot of nice pockets on the outer coat. I'm looking forward to trying it in wet weather to see how it does with a little water."
3.0,"I received this dress for free as a promotional item with other dress purchases.  I'm 5' 4&#34; and 135 lbs and the medium fits just right. However, the (cotton?) material is somewhat thin and would be pretty see through if it weren't for the blue palm trees. The material is comfortable, but it lacks quality (again too thin). Won't be wearing it much."
3.0,"I  Normally would wear a 2X but this is like a XL,,so my daughter got it"
3.0,"Bit tight, bought other compression shirts of the same size and those fit perfectly"
3.0,Really cute style but a little large - I usually wear a 6 but the only size 6 they offer is a 6 slim. I figured this would be too small so I ordered an 8. It was too big. I wish they offered a regular 6 because the style is really cute.
3.0,"These are soft leather sleepers for the house. Breathable (as they are made with leather), warm and soft. Unfortunately, the smell of the paint is so strong... it almost feels like it could be toxic. I had bought another pair (too small) before from the same brand with another design and clear color and it smelled like leather (which is what it should be). Therefore, 3 stars only."
3.0,Got a medium but could’ve gotten a small for a better fit.
3.0,The product looks good but better if it had rubber at both end to hold up. The black ones I tried on kept rolling up the thigh
3.0,"I wore these to a Mermaid Run and got so many compliments, they are super cute. The fit was much smaller than expected and I had to wear shorts over them so my backside wasn't exposed. I ordered them too close to the run and didn't have time to exchange them."
3.0,"The bottom of the dress fit fine because it just flows. The top part was too small in the arms and back. If you are busty, you should probably get a size larger than you normally wear. I couldn’t wear it."
3.0,The imprinting was so light the waves were almost invisible.
3.0,(Reviewed by my wife): I love the purple color of these earrings with the silver.  So pretty.  But the posts are so thick (probably double that of normal earrings) they are painful to get on.
3.0,On loupe had a clear lens with good center magnification. The second loupe was received with a chip in the viewing area of the  lens.
3.0,Cute but my feet kept sliding to the front of the shoe. I was going to try insoles but decided to return them.
3.0,the blazer is thin the sleeves are to long. I expected a bit thicker different material. The fit and cut of the blazer is cute.
3.0,"Was so tight, had to give to my daughter to wear. Didn’t seem to be made for adults."
3.0,It will do for a hat that I can wear while doing chores such as mowing the lawn and gardening because it has a nice sweatband on it. I have not ordered a hat online before so the size was a good fit as far as size goes.
3.0,Nice material but they definitely run small in size
3.0,One of the necklaces was broke.
3.0,"The quality of the bands were fine.  My issue was that the pegs on 6 our of the 10 were not pushed all the way through, and you couldn't secure the band in the holes.  I tried to use pliers to force the pegs through with no success.  I ended up sending them back because more than half of them were unusable."
3.0,It’s a nice watch but the extensible broke right away.
3.0,It's difficult to unscrew if you screw it on too tight.
3.0,"Fits alright, not exactly how I expected."
3.0,"Kinda get what you pay for. Grips can get slippery if you sweat and does not stand up to wind, but glasses do for out sunlight well."
3.0,"Nice belt, but runs very small"
3.0,I needed a 2 x and bought a 3x and it still was too small!!
3.0,"I liked the color and the soft fabric, but these were so small I was sure I wouldn't be able to launder them, which is just silly for sleepwear. I returned them and ordered the largest size. Hoping they won't shrank too much, but if they do, I'll update this."
3.0,It's a nice ring but I was disappointed when only after several days the stone fell off the ring. I can still wear it but the stone is what set the look of the ring off.
3.0,"revant is taking care of issue for me, I'll add to my review when everything is taking care of"
3.0,"The case arrived with a slight bend in it so it does not shut perfectly (the top and bottom don't align), but it's not terrible. However, the case was a reasonable price and for my cheap $10 sunglasses, they will do the trick. I hate spending a lot of money on sunglasses, but I also hate scratched up lenses, no matter what the cost of the glasses. Guess I could have sent the case back, but didn't bother."
3.0,The aqua socks run small.
3.0,Arrived damaged missing buttons. would have loved to keep it as I liked the fit. Sad to have to return it.
3.0,"Being a fairly broad chested/shouldered girl I'm used to tops being snug, so I really try to size accordingly. However when I did with this top, it seems a bit low on the sides and makes a loose armpit. Only difference personally that might help is a better, padded strapless bra."
3.0,You have to put them pretty far up your nose to look realistic if you have a small nose.
3.0,"I'm busty so I should've known, but this thing is too small for me. Still cute though, so I wear it over another bra."
3.0,Pretty but very transparent
3.0,Looks good however 2 had the same seam split after a few months.
3.0,"Love the colors but I rarely wear it as it hurts my ears if I wear it over them, and hurts my head if I place the elastic behind my ears.  So cute-wish it was more comfortable"
3.0,"First, the good...I like the medium weight fabric. Feels pretty nice. I also like the fit. Nice waistband that doesn’t roll. Reasonably low cut, but not too much so.<br />Now the not so good...ridiculously small sizes. I know that he sizing differences are alluded to in the description and questions, but even after adjusting for that, and after sending back the first ones in exchange for the next size up, they are still too tight. Wearable, but just barely. Take into account the explained size differential, figure out what your normal size would be...and then add another two sizes up. (It will make sense when you look at the size explanation).<br />The only other thing I didn’t care for was the leg band. Not wide enough and doesn’t stay where it’s aupposed to as well as most other boxer briefs I’ve tried."
3.0,It’s okay but not great for people with narrow shoulders and/or small chests because it fits too large.
3.0,I loved this necklace until it broke after two weeks of wear.  I think I can repair it.
3.0,Really very small..I expected it to be a bit larger
3.0,Love the hoodie except the off set hood. It feels really weird to have the hood off set on your shoulder.
3.0,These roll up alot but do the job. Bought to wear under my scrubs.
3.0,Damanged when Recieved but nice cute comfy shirt hate it had the hole
3.0,The eye part is very blurry to see through its loke you're walking through fog...Not as clear as expected a little small for the adult face but fits my 13y.o perfectly
3.0,"in the center divider is a hard plastic, makes it hard to get fingers in to remove coins."
3.0,Loose. Good for casual wear
3.0,I loved these pants at first. I've had them for a little over 2 months and they are completely stretched out. I would not recommend them. Spend more money to get better quality pants because they'll last longer.
3.0,This jumpsuit was pretty small. I got a large but the issue was being able to step into it and get it around my shoulders. Only other complaint was its a little cheap. The cuffs at the ankle were frayed and cheap looking. Otherwise it was an okay purchase
3.0,"one stone was broken , and I only got 2 , the pic shows 3 .... so its a 3 star buy"
3.0,Its plastic covered in shell and stone. The shell part is pretty thin and the stone feels thicker but I think it's just a different texture. And the bottom dark stone part seems to give the case more grip. I really loved it. But I didn't realize when I bought it that it's kind of heavy. I'm not sure how much it will protect my phone when it falls - I'm a little worried the shell or stone might break too. Not so much specific to this case - probably more because I just got a case - but it gives a much better grip to the phone than just having your phone in your hand w/o a case - mine kept slipping out of my hands before this case. It was easy to get on but is really tough to get off. I'm worried it will break or crack. Other reviews of similar cases by this company say their cases have cracked when trying to get it off or when the phone falls.
3.0,"I want to be more forgiving because they are pretty, however very thin and the tops have zero elasticity so not only thin but won't stay up."
3.0,"Good color and cut, but too long and didn't feel like a quality fabric on."
3.0,"Ugly, horrible looking, cheap bright gold frame, hideous, and  embarrassing to be seen wearing them. But....they do work very well for eye protection from the sun and glare from headlights.  Looks nothing like the picture. At least wearing them at night, no one will see them."
3.0,"Overall, this is a great swimsuit. However, the zipper is not very durable it broke on my first use."
3.0,I really like the feel of the fabric but it just seems to ride a little low and when I bend the pants don’t bend with me so my butt is shown so it’s kind of not very comfortable pants. I plan to Move the button over some to see if that won’t help with hiking the pants up some but well see
3.0,Material got really ugly after first wear haven’t even washed it
3.0,"Thinner than I expected ... I'm 5'5&#34; and a solid 140, but thin. They look great on but I lift alot.... not for leg day as the are pretty see through when you squat and stretch them. But fine for anything else"
3.0,This is my second pair of HB jeans. I like the fit and I feel safer in them. However this pair is different than the others I bout a few months ago. These have stitching above and below across the knee that hold the pads in place but does nothing for style. My other pair looks just like a normal pair of jeans with a much darker dye. I can wear thise to work. This pair will have to be weekends only. I dont know how to figure out which I am buying in the future or evdn if they still make the older style as there seems to be no way to contact HB. The quality on both is very good.
3.0,"Comfy sweater, so comfy that I bought in 2 colors. But one of them, the strings came out in the wash and were impossible to feed through the hood.  The other one, one of the metal pieces came off one of the strings never to be found again (hazard for kids /pets).  Also, easy to snag."
3.0,They work great but you can see the silver snap through the lace.
3.0,The pants are not quite the same as pictured. There is a front pleat and not as baggy as shown. The grey color is also off. Fits fine but not exactly what I was looking for
3.0,"Usually where an Extra large, but guess I need to order a large when I get RedKap shirts. other than that great shirt!"
3.0,Only one out of the 4 actually tighten
3.0,Looks nice. Seems to have good quality. Lacks arch support. No protection against cold in the inside. Overall it is a nice pair of shoes.
3.0,Heart was perfect.  Lobster clap broke within a few wears.
3.0,"Nice glasses but will break pretty easily.  Mine lasted about 1 month after only occasional wear.  That being said, great looking and decent polarization."
3.0,They seem to be fine. One showed up missing the end piece that connects to the glasses.
3.0,it is okay but the stones are very dull
3.0,Must have ordered the wrong size because these were tough to put on!
3.0,"I received the hat on time ,It's pretty,I like it ,but without a label,So I doubt if it's produced by a formal producer."
3.0,It is beautiful and true to size but it’s super thin and not normal sweatshirt material. It’s more like dry fit material with a rough inside - like a cheap hoodie. I like it but wouldn’t buy it again.
3.0,Just okay. Material is a bit rough.
3.0,"While it felt good, it really didn’t fit.  The skirt was just too short.  It was very comfortable so I debated returning it but it just didn’t look right."
3.0,putting the band on and off caused the leather strip to pull apart. used some hot glue to secure.
3.0,I thought the material would be a softer polyester almost faux cotton blend but it was instead a more &#34;chiffon&#34; polyester (if that makes sense). The fit was a bit awkward for me where the suspenders and my breasts were concerned. I am a 36C-36D  and the suspenders part kinda folded awkwardly but not horribly underneath. Overall is a so so product.
3.0,"I ordered an eight and they fit like a six, quality is good and will keep"
3.0,"The charm itself is okay. Much bigger than I expected, and the necklace part is a chain. Broke as soon as I put it on."
3.0,A little on the cheap side. Ended up giving them away.
3.0,Cute in theory. Pieces don’t fit together.
3.0,They fit good but I thought I was getting the colors advertised in the colored photographed-mauve or purple.  Navy was the predominant color.  It's too much hassle to exchange so I am wearing them.
3.0,"You have to wear a sports bra with this if you don't want to have an awkward moment. Also, I'm petite and I ordered a small, but it was still quite loose."
3.0,"The pants are super cute.  The zipper on the side is not easy to zip up, since there is no hook/eye closure.  I spent almost 10 minutes trying to get the pants to zip up, because you practically need a third hand to do so. Would not recommend unless the manufacture corrects issue."
3.0,Ran quite small. The fabric is also more spandex-y than I expected.
3.0,I had to return because I did not like the feeling of the material.
3.0,I used these to travel one time and nearly half of the zippers broke. UGH.
3.0,Shirt was fitted. I would suggest ordering a size larger
3.0,Sized up but it's very short! Ok with leggings.
3.0,Must have a really small ear for this. But it really cute.
3.0,fit well and look well.
3.0,I love the shape and size of the glasses. However. They literally put the &#34;Jimmy Orange&#34; logo on the actual lense of the glasses. I don't understand why because it looks ridiculous. However I took a butter knife and lightly scraped it off and you can't even tell.
3.0,"Review time! Decent in terms of warmth, good value for what you paid for.  The mitten covering the 4 fingers works well. The minus comes from the thumb cover, it is loose when pulled down to cover your thumb so there is always a noticeable gap. It would be nice if the thumb hole is cut smaller so when the thumb cover is on, it is more snug. As it is right now, I would rather the thumb cover be completely on, or completely cut off.  Potential fix is to sew the hole a bit smaller...  but that's when I noticed there is a little bit of fraying around the hole already from one day of wear.  While it does not affect the integrity of the gloves, I am a bit OCD so I sent them back. Still would make a decent pair of gloves of good value for people who are handy with sewing and don't mind occasional loose thread. I ended up spending a bit more for the [[ASIN:B00D9KC37Q Outdoor Research Men's Lost Coast Mitts, Pewter, Large]]."
3.0,If you don't  mind people seeing  your underwear  this dress is a great buy!
3.0,I like these for the price and this elastic band is very comfortable not too tight at all. My only complaint is that the width of the bonnet is slim so if I had any more braids or box braids it wouldn’t fit. Other than that I like it.
3.0,Been good so far
3.0,Cute kinda cheep.  Looked great.
3.0,It was the right size for my small arm
3.0,"It's an ok t-shirt. Fit is a bit small and the arm holes are a bit tight,  but decided to keep it. It's a cute shirt and the fabric is nice and soft."
3.0,"It certainly was an upgrade to the rubber band that comes with the fitbit, i am not allergic to anything and that original band gave me an awful rash, this is a nice band, just dont have much confidence that it will last too long without breaking or tearing."
3.0,"I’ve bought this exact sundress in four colors now…. Loving them all but size consistency being an issue. Thankfully, I ordered them all larger than I typical wear to use as swim cover ups on vacation & around the house, so the length difference isn’t a huge deal. What IS a HUGE deal is the sloppy workmanship! The last color choice I ordered came with one strap sewn on backwards, so the adjustable side is against the skin on one & away (like it’s supposed to be) on the other. Such a stupid thing & so incredibly FRUSTRATING!!!"
3.0,"Didn't fit as I had expected, but still looks nice. So far so good."
3.0,"For a moment I thought it was broken, but then I went on the internet to find that it wind the watch for one hour every three.  THE MEGA SHORT instruction say almost nothing about the product. I also think the design to hold the watch make to much preasure on the bracelet."
3.0,Small and no stretch. Don't buy if you have hips.
3.0,Pretty necklace but bigger then I thought . But for the price it makes a great gift .
3.0,"Yes, the rings are good quality and look pretty good. My issue with them is that I find them to be too thick. It's so thick that's cant let my fingers touch without it getting uncomfortable."
3.0,runs way small.
3.0,"Nice dress that looks just like the pic, unfortunately I took stars off because it comes with a tie that you're supposed to wrap around the dress into a bow that was at a bizarrely long length. It doesn't look very good. I tried triple knotting it and there was still a lot of excess. It's also very easy to get tangled in and the dress got caught in itself more than once. Not good when you're in public! It's also somewhat low cut. I love the dress and will work with the tie, but the designer should go back to design school."
3.0,haooy
3.0,Fits decent.
3.0,"Full coverage but definitely false advertisement with push up if you’re purchasing for size D bra size. Also, I only wore for a few hours but noticed that it started to want to slip off toward the end. May be better for smaller cup size bras."
3.0,its large......for big woman.
3.0,Good pair of glasses but these are not large by any means of the word.
3.0,It’s not removable.
3.0,They won't adjust small enough to work for me.
3.0,Not as tight as other brands i bought. Starting to loose what tightening it had.
3.0,It is a cute top but doesn't fit like the picture. I ordered an XXL just incase even though I wear an XL. Really comfy
3.0,They work pretty well helping with the bright sun. I don't drive at night so I cannot comment.
3.0,"Price is about right.  Made in China.  Looks pretty and does seem to be working...so far.  When you push the button down to open the top you usually have to help it to get it to flip open, that in itself could be embarrassing and maddening in public  Winding feels iffy.  Instructions say to wind in a clockwise direction but the gears do not start turning until about the third or fourth turn and it made me feel like I was winding in the wrong direction and I worried I had broken the mainspring before I had even begun.  It says to wind it 20 turns which I did and it seemed to have run about 9 hours on that with only losing about 30 mins.  If a person had the inclination to do some tweaking on getting the top to open smoother and was much more careful winding it than you would be with a more expensive watch it might be ok for occasional use like going to a party or a bar.  Make a nice prop I suppose for re-enactors, models, or acting use.  It does feel much too fragile to me though to stand up to normal, practical use.  I would not rely on it for a timepiece without a backup watch or cell phone clock if you had any urgent appointments.  It is attractive at first glance and watching the gears move is very novel and fun for younger people who may not have seen a skeleton watch in action before.  All in all by today's standards the price is about right (fifty years ago this might have had a $2 - $5 price tag in a gas station) but this does not feel like something that will work for more than a few months.  Chain is not too bad.  Bottom line to me is it feels more like costume jewelry or what I believe is called 'Bling' in today's vernacular.  Top drawer Walmart jewelry or stage prop.<br /><br />Actually, 50 years ago this would not have sold for $2 - $5 dollars in a gas station.  It would have more likely been found in a two-piece clear plastic ball in one of those giant .50 cent gumball machines, and more than likely had been made in Japan and as a result would probably still be working today ; )"
3.0,Would have been nice to know that this wasn't a slide on type but actually the kind you have to clip on like a necklace it's a huge pain in the butt had to have help putting it on
3.0,"It fit snug around the chest.  I ordered a 3x, my usual size, but this is snug.  I will keep, not worth returning."
3.0,good quality just a little too big
3.0,I have a few of them I think they're pretty I have never worn them I want to give them away has gifts
3.0,"Dimensions were perfect for my chest, shoulders and torso length. My gut makes it a snug fit but that's ok, I can thin that out in a month or two.<br /><br />Product description and picture gives the impression that you're getting a shirt and tie with it BUT it's the vest ONLY."
3.0,"Great bag, except the straps are so slick they constantly slide down and make the bag too long."
3.0,"If you have a bust at all this won't fit, also an odd length.  Quality material however"
3.0,"I got a large and I average sizes 10/12. 5.5 170. It fits loose and floppy. Not tailored like the one in the picture. It’s kind of itchy on the skin and I have NO idea what its made of, because there is no tag indicating anything, but it feels very synthetic. I like that it’s thinner, I get hot when stores and homes blast heat. I wish it were shaped like the picture, but I will keep it, since I need a throw on badly."
3.0,Came without the airbag and was a bit bulky.
3.0,The fabric was a lot lighter than I anticipated
3.0,It's cute and I got lots of compliments but I read so many reviews so I knew what size to get and it was still a little big....but showed up on time
3.0,Great fit ... ordered one day here the next.
3.0,No shape...blocky
3.0,A little too long for me. I gave it to my co-worker and she loves it.
3.0,Can't seem to adjust it correctly...hurts my ears :(
3.0,"The ears are good, the bow tie is good but a little big. The tail is a complete joke though."
3.0,Way small I got the 3x and it fits like a large
3.0,Cute on..weird material.
3.0,"The dress is pretty, fabric is soft and flowing.  I'm 5'4"" and bought a large.  I expected it to be a bit long (it was), and expected the waist of the dress to fall at my natural waist.  Instead, the waist of the dress was almost level with the bottom of my bra, making it look like a maternity dress."
3.0,Run pretty small
3.0,"As a G-Shock, this is as good as any of 'em - pretty much identical to the modules in the DW5600, the regular DW6900, etc. But in person, the colors are not as impressive as I'd hoped. The color of the main face plate is straight dark grey, not the blue-toned gray the pictures convey; the yellows, blues, and reds of the various text are there, but they don't really pop or stand out that much. Considering the whole aesthetic deal with this line of G-Shocks, I was hoping for more."
3.0,Don't bother getting this off you have boobs. It has a short strap and the ONLY thing that will fit in there is a phone. Cute though. Thinking about getting a longer strap for it.
3.0,"I've given the delivered product 3 stars for the fact of size & fit were excellent. I wanted and bought flag leggings and I received flag leggings. The problem which afforded the product a rating of 3 out of 5 was that I didn't receive what I paid for, see the attached pic. If time permitted it, a return with a very disdain and disappointment riddle message would've been done. The ones promoted by LJIF are definitely and truly nicer than what I got. However, I needed a pair of flag leggings promptly and had to force myself to keep what I got.<br /><br />Won't be ordering from LJIF any further, one disappointment is plenty."
3.0,"Hat is &#34;ok&#34;. It will leave fuzzies all over and the way it lays is kind of odd and makes me look like I'm wearing a Russian Military Winter hat. However, it is warm!"
3.0,"If you are prone to migraines, please avoid."
3.0,READ CAREFULLY. If you are looking for the newer models that work with a smartphone this isn't it!. Its a cheap piece of costume plastic and not even remotely realistic. Suitable I suppose for a costume party (although I wouldn't pay 55 bucks for it again) but if you're into cosplay keep looking.
3.0,"Item was ok, material wasn't really what I expected. But I still wear it"
3.0,One of my favorite dresses!!!!!
3.0,"Unfortunately I didn't think this fit well. I have an apple shape so the top was the right size but the pants were too narrow and tight.  Given this was a 1X, I expected the pants fit to be more generous.  I didn't care for the material either.  I usually like satin but this didn't seem very substantial. Back it goes!  My experience with the seller so far has been fine though."
3.0,"I really liked this scarf. It's really cute, and for the price it's not bad. But I would have liked it a little bit longer. It's barely long enough to wear as a shawl. And it's kind of an awkward length for a scarf. It's perfectly fine if you intend to tie it in a knot around your neck, but the length does kinda limit what you can do with it."
3.0,Pretty good for a carry all..nothing fancy
3.0,"Ordered xl got a waaay small size. In my eagerness to open the package i ripped the bag so i couldnt send it back, that was my fault, but the wrong size through me off completely. ... it was extra small lol. Other than that the print was clear and  looked like the picture"
3.0,i had to give these to my daughter because the run a little small
3.0,Good quality wish it came in bigger size (length) fits tight around my arm but however good
3.0,"These are a really nice, thick, and soft material! Just run a little large"
3.0,You get what you pay for with this cover up. The fringe is very stringy so you'll have to trim it up a lot to keep wearing it.
3.0,Too small & couldn't reorder as not good selection in my size. Really liked the product. Perhaps at a later date can check for size.
3.0,Dress was too shear and the waistline looked funny on my small torso
3.0,"It looks pretty, it feels nice, and it came with a bra extender which I thought was a big plus, so those are the reason it still got 3 stars. BUT it's way too small. Order AT LEAST a size up...no, make that two!"
3.0,"I’m 5’1”, 36C And normally a size 6 in most things so I ordered a medium. I loved almost everything about this dress but it was definitely too booby. I’m not even wearing a push up bra in the pic and you can see it fits weird/too exposed there. Too bad bc the length would have w been perfect with some heels. Will have to return."
3.0,"So far, I've only worn this dress once. Not sure why this dress is not flattering on me. It looks boxy."
3.0,I  returned  these
3.0,"It says that it runs regular sizes but the large fit me like an extra large, it is just way too big! Other than that the design is amazing and it is super soft, so I suppose I just have a fandom night shirt now."
3.0,"It is almost to big, I have a very small wrist.  The 3 stars is because I have to take it out of the band to charge it."
3.0,The purse was cheaply made and sub par quality.
3.0,"I bought this red robe to wear after I get out of the shower while getting ready. It's adorable, but I should've washed it several times before wearing. The first time I washed it (wash it by hand- do NOT let this touch any of your clothes), the water was hot pink (so much dye I couldn't even see my hands underwater). I should've known them to wash it again. My countertop, a chair, and my bed all now have pink stains. It even rubs off on my skin! I wiped my chest with a white bath cloth and it turned pink.<br /><br />Anyway, it's super cute, but beware of the dye transfer."
3.0,"Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  I  charge my battery all night, but it still registers 0% when I put it in my phone."
3.0,"This was a gag-gift for my father in law.  Funny idea, but don't think that the fan is effective enough to provide an adequate breeze."
3.0,"I like the shirt but wish it was longer and didn't fit as baggy in the waist area.  It does not fit as snug as it shows on the model.  As for the shirt's material, it is super soft and stretchy.  The material is cool enough for me to wear here in Florida to work.  It is nice and casual and I wear it to work as a teacher at a high school.  I love that the zipper does not come down as I like to wear it up high to cover my chest.  The sleeves are also perfect for me.  I like to cover my arms as I am a little out of shape after having baby number 4.  So one other good thing is that the shirt does not show the flaws like muffin top etc."
3.0,My only complaint is the fuzz spot which is also dark brown which made me upset bc it was suppose to be all black. The hat fits perfect.
3.0,Low rating due to the stem on these are very short so you have manipulate them to make them stay.  But you do get a variety of stone sizes.
3.0,"Price was right, and I do lock the ratcheting adjustment, but after 6 months the belt has a significant tear in it about 8 inches from the end of it (not the buckle end).<br /><br />I rotate this with two to three other belts, so this one only gets worn a couple of days a week typically. Disappointed in the overall quality to have a belt tear within that short of a time frame."
3.0,"These are very cute!! Right out of the package though the fold of the gloves were not stitched together lol. I had to super glue it so it could stay in place. But for the price, who cares! Great material very warm and perfect for my super small hands. I needed something like this for me cuz I never find gloves that can fit my hands LOL"
3.0,"These are comfy and fit as expected, however the sole began peeling off at the toe after about two months of wear. Was expecting them to last all school year because of the brand. Too bad."
3.0,"Love the dress but sizing is off. I ordered a black XL originally (because reviews advised to size up) and was swimming in it. Then I ordered a large black and a Medium maroon and the large black is smaller than the medium maroon! Weird. I am 5’8” 148 pounds for reference. Overall, I still really like this dress. Just gave the XL to someone else. Currently wearing the medium maroon and goal is to fit into the large black 🤣"
3.0,"These look and fit great on my body. However, they are VERY short. I feel like I am going to be exposed through the legs of the shorts because of how short they are. They fit perfectly around the waist, so I feel like if I got a bigger size the waist wouldn't fit me anymore. I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to go to the beach with these on. However, they do look good."
3.0,They make great gifts but for me my feet still got cold but my friends say they love them
3.0,Nice but also very loud. They chime and cling as you move.
3.0,"I will get it three stars since the bands seem like good quality, but I also give it three stars because it wouldn't go small enough.  The original band on the watch went to the needed size, but these bands will not.  I'll keep searching for smaller band"
3.0,The material was not very good quality and it fits tighter
3.0,To long for 5'1
3.0,I wasn’t expecting this top to be shiny.
3.0,The material was too thin and the arms too short.
3.0,Pretty but smaller then picture
3.0,"Its a bit tight, but very comfy."
3.0,"I got this suit at the end of August 2022. It fit so nice and very flattering on the mom tummy.  My only complaint is that after only a few wears I went in a hot tub and the color faded up to the water line. The top was solid mint green, and now it looks tie-died. No one elses suit faded like mine after using that hot tub. Hmmmmm"
3.0,Fell apart after a few weeks and the black coloring toward the bottom of the shoe rubbed off. :(
3.0,Almost fit. Runs a little small for those with bigger busts.
3.0,"I've used these diapers in the past, they were great. I ordered before and got 6 like the title and description says, this time I only got 4. I'm not understanding why every where says 6 but the picture is only 4, which one is it? I know in the past I received 6. This isn't fair to the buyer, false advertisement for sure!"
3.0,"The shirt I bought from Wicked Metal Camaro is what I expected<br />Fits well and the material is good quality, I highly recommend this company<br />I wll buy from them again"
3.0,"Sizing was spot on, they ride up a lot and are not squat/sweat proof."
3.0,The necklace looks like the picture but I just didn't like it that much. It looked kinda weird on me and it' flips a lot which is annoying.
3.0,The dress was very cute but I was see-through and a little tight around the shoulder area.
3.0,"These are still great for kids starting out with goggle wearing and adjustment.  However, the constant lack of large size is bothersome for parents with kids over the age of 5.  We had a large pair for my 7-yr old that lost a lens after about a year of use.  A good life span for kids goggles.  We got a medium pair for our younger child.  I recommend these for transitioning between head-up doggy paddling and beginner strokes.  Great for promoting independence.  Our kids learned to put these on themselves quickly.  Once they're more familiar with goggles and the swim gear routine, it's time to move on to the usual gel/plastic straps."
3.0,"Muy buen material, pero no es el size yo escogí M y es como un L"
3.0,Very pretty ! a little bigger than i thought it would be. The stone does seem more plastic like though versus looking like a crystal/stone
3.0,better umbrella than cane
3.0,These broke easily and I lost a part of it within a couple of months.
3.0,"THE STONES WERE NICE AND SHINY, BUT THE NECKLACE AND VERY DELICATE. ALSO, NOW ITS 43.00 MORE THAN I PAID FOR IT NOW."
3.0,Runs big- very warm
3.0,did the job well. my butt might be too rotund for this product but all in all a good pant.
3.0,Typically go between a women's 10-12 so i ordered a size large. It fit as expected however material was very thin. Was planning on wearing this too a wedding but I'm too afraid of someone's flash going off and the dress being so see through.
3.0,"Perhaps a piece is missing, but oil leaks every so slowly out of this container. Three times since buying it I've notice my oil supply completely gone and I'm definitely not performing that many ordinances. At least it's not messy and it's the easiest to use."
3.0,Not made well just a cut out dress and pictures shown makes it a lot nicer than it is
3.0,Not good fabric .
3.0,cute but low quality
3.0,Good looking shoes but not a superb shoe
3.0,I own three of these skirts and this one doesn’t seem to fit like the other two. I bought the other two off Jane.com and this one feels way tighter everywhere and doesn’t wash as well.
3.0,"The belt was as described, however, it is difficult to use, very difficult to release belt while wearing.  This was a gift and recipient said they would deal with it!"
3.0,Not the best and not the worst good in a pinch or for back up
3.0,Great fit....except in the waist...it falls down now. Bummer.
3.0,"I liked the color, texture, and elasticity of product. But waist felt loose"
3.0,Just as expected but a little loose
3.0,Purchased for a friend via my Amazon account. She likes it.
3.0,"Had to take off stars because the pockets are set in the side seam so high that they gapped open with the dress on.  Trust me, it's not because of my shape.  I sewed the pockets shut and now it fits just fine and no gapping.  Pockets in a dress seem cool, but what would I be putting in there anyway? The fabric is a stretch knit on top and a stretchy woven on the skirt.  If the skirt color looks bright white on your screen be aware that it is actually a crem color.  Lovely dress for dinner out or even going to a barbecue."
3.0,"The frame was twisted because the sunglasses were just put in a heavy envelope instead of a box. I was going to send it back but I was able to remove the screw and re set the lense in the frame so I think it will be ok even though I blemished the area on the metal with the screw driver. I’m surprised they didn’t get completely crushed in shipping.<br />As for the glasses themselves, I ordered these because I owned the exact pair previously and are my favorite sunglasses I’ve owned (for the money/quality). Peppers has a nice replacement  warranty and nice products that you don’t have to break the bank over."
3.0,"Material isn’t as absorbent as I had hoped, so it’s not a great robe for getting out of the shower but it’s great for wearing around the house or during down time."
3.0,Looked beautiful but material is super cheap. Snagged immediately and had a lot of pulling throughout the dress.
3.0,It broke the first time I tried to put it on!
3.0,"I am 5’2, and this dress is very long on me. I have to wear really tall high heels shoes for this dress not to drag the ground. It is cute and very flattering, and fits as expected with plenty of stretch. It is just very long on me. If you are tall, girl, this may work for you."
3.0,"I really like it but one stone had fallen out and was loose in the bag when I got it, and then I lost it. I could've glued it in but it makes me concerned that more of them will fall out before or while I'm wearing it. I tried to order another one but it will be a week or more before I get it and I need it before that. Very disappointed."
3.0,Not bad the clasp is a little tricky until you get used to it..
3.0,"Heads up very plastic costume kind of material:( was beautiful but to small.<br />I'm 5ft 120lbs<br />could have gotten the wrong size.<br />So depending what your looking for, hope this helps."
3.0,Can't wear the hat. Doesn't fit on my head and I don't even have a big head. Maybe I'll just give it to my son
3.0,Cute dress.  Cut way too small.  More tight-fitting than fitted.  I ordered the largest size and am contemplating returning it or dieting and buying Spanx...
3.0,The only thing i was really upset with about this product was that it was smaller than i expected but other then that it's a very nice product
3.0,Ok earrings
3.0,Waited for a while and got it it was a great product until it started to turn my wrist screen and started to discolor underneath the watch but great quality watch very well put together but only if they could change the fact that it turned your wrist green and has a bit of quality issues
3.0,"The product is ok, but is somebody put perfúme on that item is very weird I don’t now if somebody put on take with that kind of shipments<br />Thank you<br />Allan"
3.0,"I'm not a huge fan of the shiny lightweight material the pants are. They are super wrinkly and it'd be hard to get them out with an iron, because they'd damage the pants. The fit was OK, but overall, the picture a bit misleading as in person, the fabric looked cheap. Returned."
3.0,My son loves the sweatshirt but I hate the color. It's more pink then red
3.0,It is cute ring but the stones sets up high.
3.0,Cute but not high quality and doesn't wash well
3.0,I like this band but I have to keep tightening it. It’s not a band I would wear often
3.0,kinda shallow for hat
3.0,Pockets came sewed shut
3.0,"I wish I would have taken the time to pull out a ruler and see how big 6mms were before I actually purchased these earrings.  While the CZ has a pretty cut to it, I don't particularly care for the cheap look to the way they are mounted.  Their large size just screams ""fake"" also.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not really thrilled with the price paid given how they look (there's no way these are passing as diamonds) and probably won't wear these anywhere near as much as some of my smaller sized CZ earrings, but might break these out if I'm going to the beach or a casino."
3.0,"I received a crotchless body suit, not exactly what I was expecting. It worked well as shapewear though"
3.0,When the description says &#34;oversized&#34; they mean OVERSIZED! Bigger than I expected!!
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34; and 150.  This fit ok.  The top part didn't blouse at all like it did on the model.  The material is like a dry fit athletic shirt, just odd.  It's cute, but not for me. I'm returning"
3.0,Liked the jacket was a bit disappointed in the liner/inner jacket was much thinner than expected did not feel it was the inner jacket would be warm enough to wear by it self. If liner/jacket had been a bit thicker would have kept the jacket. Sleeves were good length. I have long arms so is always a challenge to find jackets with long enough sleeves.
3.0,The quality of this product is very good... but the size is much too small for an adult.
3.0,Runs big..great coloring but I had to return.
3.0,"La cintura del vestido me queda un poco arriva, a mi gusto debe ser mas abajo. El tono del color no fue el esperado, aunque son parecidos no son iguales el de la foto de su catalogo y el que me llego, sobretodo el color del liston de la cintura."
3.0,"I am thin, petite & have small feet. These  slippers are narrow on me. But, they are very warm & comfortable. Was a good price."
3.0,"They are made good and seams are strong, I bought these to wet and wear around my neck to help keep me cool while working outside in the S FL summer heat, they may work good for a mask bearer ect. But as a neck cooler to wet and wear they are not good at all, they dry very fast , then the only thing to help you is your sweat to keep them wet, I will use these up, but will never buy again for this purpose, the material is very thin and feels like a nylon or spandex, probably why they don't stay wet long at all"
3.0,"I bought this for a Citizen Ecodrive that has a canvas band. It does not fit out of the box. A little dremel work on the attachment points, and I was able to get it to work, but I wouldn't recommend it as a Citizen band replacement. Granted, they aren't advertising it as such either.<br /><br />The quality of the band seems ok. The machining was mostly good, but the attachment links are hollow and make for a cheap feel. I don't know if this is standard or not, but I did not care too much for the way that part of the band is made. The clasping mechanism seemed generally fine, although it did not rest as flush as I would have liked.<br /><br />I ended up putting the canvas strap back on my watch. If I feel the need to have a steel band, I'll probably look for a genuine Citizen band."
3.0,This belt runs very small. It is a nice addition to the wardrobe but does measure small.
3.0,Holy cow does this run small. I might not be a tiny woman but the XL was intolerable because it was so tight.
3.0,"The product itself is nice. Although, I did see it run small, also, the color isn't green, it's clearly blue, unless I was sent wrong wrong. Patterns are completely off compared to picture"
3.0,Dress fit ok except for neckline.  Small opening and very high V neckline.  Returned dress.  Would have kept except for this.
3.0,Once I order a Size up from my normal size it fitted better.
3.0,"quality fair, weird seaming in front, otherwise good coverage"
3.0,Good no show socks but fall off with certain shoes.
3.0,More like sunglasses than glasses.
3.0,Two came without the pad
3.0,This i very comfortable but does not have a wire to pinch over the nose.
3.0,"Definitely NOT cropped pants, these went all the way to my ankle and still left a little lag at the bottom.  Nice pants, but NOT cropped."
3.0,nice bought smaller than expected.
3.0,"Didn't get hands warm the way they said it would, won't want to wear these gloves skying."
3.0,"The watch keeps good time but the step monitoring is quite a bit off on accuracy.  It sometimes registers steps even when you're not moving.  I would say the accuracy is off by about 5-10% on the high side for total mileage/steps walked during the day. The heart rate monitor works only sporadically.<br /><br />Also, the supplied instructions on how to use the various functions are for the most part written in mandarin characters and are essentially useless to those who know only English.<br />Simply trial and error is how you learn to operate the various functions on this pedometer watch, but for $16 what can you expect. At least it keeps excellent time."
3.0,"They don’t have sizes individually, you are either a small / medium or large/extra large. My sister is an X/small but because of the fleece I was going to get her a small. Well medium/ small is too big.<br /><br />-Sarah"
3.0,The socks are thin and easy to put on. They fit perfect.
3.0,Poor quality. Missed the boat on a return. Not crazy about the print in person.
3.0,"Sized for grown woman, we wanted some for a young granddaughter."
3.0,"Let me say that the service from the seller  was great, and very prompt...but to be honest I can't be as enthusiastic as other reviewers. The  packaging is beautiful --- but the watch is quite lightweight --- fine for some I guess - but I expected a more substantial piece. The case is clunky and not particularly aesthetic in design. But for the price? Well I guess what you pay for and for a couple of hundred bucks, I guess its OK... on the other hand I would have serious doubts as to the worth at the claimed RRP, sorry, and I certainly dont conssider it an ""heirloom watch"" Am I being harsh? I really dont think so"
3.0,"Fit as expected when i first put it on & it wasn't tight as all. However, after 30min of wearing the top it became extremely lose and now doesn't fit. Very disappointing"
3.0,The dress is nice for a winter dress not for Houston weather though. Tight fit at the arms and chest ordered a L returned felt to tight above
3.0,"I received the first one in the mail quickly, but when I opened it, I found it to be broken. No worries. Amazon has a great return policy. The only problem was working with Fossil. It took almost a month for the whole process to be resolved. (HOW IN THE WORLD COULD FOSSIL NOT HAVE ANY RECORD OF MY ORDER OR THE FACT THAT I SENT THE WATCH BACK?!)<br /><br />So then I received my new one in the mail. Finally. And guess what? It broke again within 2 months. I'm waiting until I have a chance to take it to a jewelry store because I don't want to deal with Fossil's return process again. (I had to escalate the issue to include an Amazon representative because I was getting nowhere with the team at Fossil.)"
3.0,It has a velvety feel/look to it. My rings get caught and nip the dress. It’s not as flattering as I thought. Where it crops in the middle it poofs out on the sides
3.0,Very thin and small
3.0,I bought a 3x it firs like a 2x
3.0,the neck area is a little too small as my fiance could not button the collar button
3.0,"Cap is okay, it is very thin which I don't like as it doesn't feel like its good quality. I got it for free in exchange for a honest review. I will not be using this product. It might work okay for others, i prefer one that’s better quality."
3.0,Way to small. Did not fit comfortably around the bust and neck
3.0,"I normally wear a Large, I ordered a XL, still to small in the arms and shoulders. Sent it back."
3.0,"Some colors are very similar to each other and they are smaller than normal pocket squares, but they do their job and my husband now has lots of colors."
3.0,This was cheaper than most other animal hoodies on the market... it wasn't as cute as in the picture (more dull and not as vibrant). Boyfriend liked it though!
3.0,Hired someone to put them all together. He said that instructions were vague.
3.0,Regular wear.
3.0,"I bought this for a Halloween costume. For that purpose, the watch was fine. However, the wristband is huge, and I wasn't sure if I could take links out of the watchband without breaking it--there were no instructions on this. I think for a costume this is great, but as far as it looking like real gold or diamonds..."
3.0,The fabric snags very easily.
3.0,"I bought two and one came to me defective. The strings were all stuck in the adjustable part and it broke when I tried to pull them out. I love it and it is exactly like the picture, but it was cheaply made I guess."
3.0,"This mask looks super dope, but unfortunately, it came without a box and it arrived shattered. The second one (replacement) was shattered as well so I sent that back too. I stopped getting replacements because if they were shipping each one the same way then they all would probably come broken and shattered. It really was too bad. I really loved the mask, but I don't love a broken one."
3.0,"Warm and soft, but the arms are very short length. I can’t wear this out of the house because of how short the arms are. 3stars because it is warm and good enough."
3.0,"Great Design and size for Price ... I also had chain came out of loop so had to fix that<br />My colors are off too..?.. what I see in Picture are BRITE Primary Colors of Red Yellow Green and such like Ranibow<br />What I Received is more Muted Fall Colors Red is Rust and other colors not as bright. purchased for a gift Not sure if will gift it or not<br />A bit disappointed, AL"
3.0,"Dress was beautiful, only downfall, material was thin, but not see through"
3.0,"Is not fabric is like plastic made, and that is the reason i dont like it"
3.0,"I will start off by saying that everything in the description is accurate. I am normally a 9 in US men’s and I decided to take a shot on the smaller size, I will say that the smaller size fit but they were definitely stretched out. So if you are getting some get them your actual size as described on the size chart<br /><br />The Marino wool is super nice, I have owned a pair of Marino wool in the past and it always seems to be that it breathes really well. My feet never got sweaty these were super breathable. They did remind me of dress socks because they were thinner, but that could of also been because of the stretch.<br /><br />All in all would recommend!"
3.0,This shirt has a very loose flowing look and feel to it. However the neck is too small to have off the shoulder. If I do it anyway the shirt looks pulled and tight and it just looks like I'm taking a normal neck line and forcing it over my shoulder. So if your looking for loose and flowing top this is great. If your looking for off the shoulder specifically you will be disappointed.
3.0,"I ordered my usual size, but the front is VERY weird fitting. Cancel toe city."
3.0,Too small to be one size fits all! But we’ll made.
3.0,"I like the size of this handbag. It allows me to carry my iPad and other things I need, like glasses. The one thing I’m disappointed in is the straps (handles). They are in the way, and won’t stay down. I have two other Brahmin handbags and the straps are not like this purse. I almost sent it back. These handles are not the same quality as other Brahmin bags. They are stiff and appear to be some type of composite material. Look like corners are being cut to reduce the cost of producing this purse. Not what I expected from Brahmin"
3.0,"These are cute and they don't irritate my ears like some do, but one of the backs didn't fit properly and is now lost. I don't have a replacement back that fits, so now I can't wear them."
3.0,I don't like the way these fit on my chest.
3.0,a little thin.  great for moderate weather.
3.0,I ordered the 38/40mm M/L size.  They are more like a 38/40mm S/M.  Luckily I can wear either.  I prefer a looser fit so I get the M/L.  If you are a big M/L they may not fit you.
3.0,But they are so cute
3.0,"Ugly but, incredibly comfortable. Stiting uneven. Large punture marks in front. Lots of loose threads. Like to have more colirs"
3.0,It's smaller than I thought and doesn't fit the arm rest well. I wish the inside had a stickier liner so It was more stable.
3.0,"Absolutely serves the purpose-- but is a little rough around the edges. Literally. Does not scream ""High-quality product"" And I suspect the edges will come undone over time, leaving this a useless carrier."
3.0,"WAAAAYYYYYYYYYY too small...!!!!!! My mother ordered this shirt in XL as she is normaly a L... I ended up wearing it and it fit perfectly... I'm a US XS!!!!!!!! Gorgeous shirt, but from XS to XL there's a big difference!!!!"
3.0,"The color are very nice and bright ,but they are very heavy , my daughter doesn't have enough hair to keep them in place since they are very heavy."
3.0,"I got this because the original leather band for my Pebble steel didn't fit anymore. The hole I was using in the leather strap got stretched after I had the watch for nearly a year. This band was the best alternative I could find, but I wish it were better.  The silicone is nice and smooth, but springy enough that it presses unevenly. Maybe that will work itself out with time, but up front it is less comfortable. The look is also not quite as nice. The buckle on the Pebble was designed with a curve and fit that made it go flush with the band, while the buckle on this one it sticks out.  And the look of the material is okay, not especially cheap looking, but not as nice as the leather band it is replacing."
3.0,Awesome but WAY understated about how small they run! I wear lg and on occasion over seas ordering xl but these were xl and idk if even a xxl would work!
3.0,Disappointed that a inside thread pulled when I put my socks on and now I have a run in the socks! It was only the 2nd time putting them on and I have other compression socks but never had this happen before! Very disappointed! Cool pattern though!
3.0,"I like the hat, the design is nice but it is a a bit loose on my head."
3.0,Also cute & broke fast
3.0,I like the design and it's a nice bathing suit but they're not board shorts so why that's in the name I have no freaking idea basically you just lied
3.0,The blouse is nice but is too small
3.0,Fit is small. Material is a step up from costume felt. We were expecting something a bit better.
3.0,"Hate the material but missed the return window. The idea of this is cute, the item however is shiny and reminds me of pleather. Not a fan. Sorry!"
3.0,"I got these on a 'special' sale...  not sure what I'll do w/ them, cuz pretty mediocre.."
3.0,too small. had to return
3.0,"way larger than described,but they are cute and dcent made,think the sizing is not accurate.or i possibly made a mistake."
3.0,This last set of bibs I got are different from what I normally buy. I didn’t get what I ordered. I’m accustomed of buying the ones that ties to the back of the neck while these are to fit over the head. Doesn’t work as good.
3.0,"Let me start out by saying that once you get these shoes on, they're great.  Hard soles so that sticks/rocks won't hurt their feet, swimsuit material everywhere else.  However, my dexterous five year old can't put these on in less than 10 minutes, and even I have a hard time doing it in five."
3.0,Not the best quality but you get what you paid for... They are pretty but fragile again you get what you paid for them.
3.0,"A little orangey in color, but a great bag that's the perfect size."
3.0,The color was okay but the scrub he duo part looks nothing like the photo.
3.0,"This is definitely a ""lightweight"" cardigan.  It's pretty sheer, so you need to be cognizant of that when you pair it with a top.  I do like the fit and style, I just would have preferred it be less ""see-thru."""
3.0,"That picture where the money clip is still holding 30 bills upside down is a lie. The closest I can get is 27 bills and it's BARELY holding at that. If I shake it just a little, it comes loose. 25 bills is ok, but if you want solid retention, you should have more than 20 bills. I was pretty hopeful for this money clip. It's basically the same as every other money clip like this. I mean, I guess it's worth 10 bucks, but I'm just mad af that they got my hopes up saying it will hold 30 bills, and it kinda sounded like it could hold even more. I got this for free to review it, and boy I'm glad I did. I'll never use it, so if I paid for it, I'd be even more angry. Also, the card slot that is closest to the magnet is incredibly hard to get a card out of. The only reason I didn't give it only 1 star is because it's not falling apart and seems to be basically on par with other money clips in its class. I wouldn't pay 10 bucks for it though, or even 5.<br /><br />EDIT: After I wrote this review, the seller contacted me and said they changed the # of bills it holds to 25, so I'm giving it an additional star. They also said they are working to fix that card slot and make it a little less difficult to get the card out. If that is true, I'd give it a 4th star, but I have no way to test it. If they send me another one and it's indeed better, I'll go ahead and give it a 4th star. It'd be hard to earn a 5th star though because it's still just a run of the mill leather money clip. It's decent and a good price, but it doesn't blow me away or anything. If it was $5 or would hold like 35 bills, I'd give it 5 stars"
3.0,"I specifically searched for “yellow” gold, however the watch in person looks more rose gold as compared to the photo online."
3.0,"This dress is very beautiful.  It's kinda thin, but I think that would make it perfect when the weather is hot.  But it looks beautiful."
3.0,"The pants seem to fit everywhere pretty well except for the legs. The legs are a little tight, but I do have massive legs. My only complaint is that the fit at the legs are a little tight and isnt flexible, so I couldn't move as much. Overall, it works for a cute pant."
3.0,"Revised: The leather belt is high quality material and looks great, but the buckle broke after a few months of moderate wear. Apparently, the buckle is made out of Pewter quality metal. The metal is coated well, so there was no indication that a load bearing part inside the buckle was such poor quality. I'm trying to decide if they are cheap enough to justify replacing them every few months. They look great and work well, until they don't and you have to throw them away. I would rather buy one made with quality metal which could last years. Otherwise, it is easy to adjust and release with one hand. Don't forget to read the little instruction sheet which comes with the belt. I thought I was trapped in the belt until I discovered where the release lever was located. : D"
3.0,"The Cargo Pants are quality, great material...but waaaay too small. I normally wear a 10 maybe 12...I ordered XL and couldn't even come close to buttoning them. They felt like my size 6's. So hence the 3 stars. I have them returned and no reorder because that was the largest size."
3.0,A bit un flexible.  Not bad for the price.
3.0,"This is a fine shirt, looks nice, and sizing is accurate. However, I am leaving 3 stars because the material specified in the description is not the actual material of the shirt. The description says 93% Rayon and 7% spandex. However the actual shirt was 95% Cotton and 5% spandex. I absolutely love Rayon and was specifically looking for that material, so I was a bit disappointed."
3.0,I thought this would be way more elegant. It is made of cloth at the top and then chains come off of it. My sister kindly called me a stripper for wearing it...so there's that.
3.0,"Did not like the way this looked on me. I carry my weight in the belly section and this suit just didn't work out for me. Otherwise actually pretty, nice colors and good quality material."
3.0,"When I enlarged the opening to get this on I always felt like it was going to fall off.  And when I tightened it up it really hurt to get it off.  The edges at the opening weren't real smooth.  Im going to look for a different style of this, not a cuff..  I like how narrow it is and that it only says blood thinner.  It just didn't fit well for me."
3.0,"I bought 3 pairs of these in different colors. 1 arrived with the wide legs as portrayed in the picture, but the cloth was extremely thin and almost see through.<br /><br />The other 2 colors had nice quality cloth, but the legs are just barely wider than boot cut, and not wide as portrayed.<br /><br />Very disappointing...  Next time I will go for the higher price, which will hopefully be what I want."
3.0,"This little dress is summery and so cute, but be advised that it runs small. I tried to adjust the ""sleeves"" and one of them tore, so now I wear it as a nightgown. I do like that it has a lining because otherwise it would be see-through. Order a size if you buy and you will be very happy with it!"
3.0,Super cute. However it’s much thicker material than what I was hoping for. It seems the light Cotten nighties only come in white. We were hoping for more colors.
3.0,My granddaughter love this but she said it’s smelled like fish. So it came in this plastic wrapping that I kept it in and then wrapped it on top of that for Christmas. And my granddaughter opens it and just could not stop telling me how much it smelled bad LOL other than that though she really loved the ballet dress
3.0,I absolutely love this jumpsuit DOWNFALL: it’s too short and I’m only 5’6<br />I ended up hemming the pants an inch to make it look like they were supposed to be a Capri jumpsuit.
3.0,"Yeah, too narrow for my eyes."
3.0,Very tight and hard to get on
3.0,I like it. It is adorable but sensitive. If not stored upright the time will stop 😪
3.0,The sole separated from the foot pad after only a few months. When olukai first came out the slippers lasted a lot longer. Now I’m lucky to get 6 months wear! They are not cheap either! I was told that I can get a replacement…..where did I put that receipt?
3.0,My little girl loved this outfit but the stitching around the cutout letters on the shirt are coming undone after just 2 washes and the tutu is made of polyester so seems to get really warm in it.
3.0,Cute pattern.. I ordered the size I normally wear and it seemed very large. Wasn't flattering so I returned it.
3.0,Demasiado pequeño hay q comprar una talla más para q quede bien.
3.0,"Very heavy, too large for a skinny neck"
3.0,Sizing not right
3.0,Lenght is awesome
3.0,Even tho I bought a size Large the waistband which has elastic thru it makes it way too tight around the waist.  I will suffer thru this situation and wait to see if it will loosen up.  Or donate them and buy an X-Large.  Don't like wasting money like this.
3.0,"Not bad, but geez, why would you leave out the most popular color of black?  I don't need 5 orange or chartreuse.  I have nothing to match some of these colors. or what about including a pattern? and make them a little more substantial.  not thrilled"
3.0,nice / cheap ring . holds up in water well. my stone was loose. but hasnt fallen out ive had it a yr. worth the price*
3.0,"Very clingy, especially in the back. Would work well for someone without rolls lol"
3.0,"Looks great very creepy, only issue is the hair came off after the first use."
3.0,The person receiving it has not said whether she liked it or not
3.0,I bought this product for a friend who is normally a size 12. When they arrived she tried them on and couldn't get them up past her knees much less over her backside. I kept them because I could wear them. I normally wear a size 4. They are awesome as far as being comfortable and super cute. The description says an XXL. I neglected to look at the sizing chart because I assumed that XXL would surely fit a size 12 and very loosely. The chart is pretty much on point but very off as far as XXL sizing typically goes. Make sure to use the sizing chart. These will not fit someone over a size 6 I would be willing to say. The seller needs to change the description.
3.0,"Got for a girl wearing size 1 women shoe.  She loves them and the light patterns that she can select.  By placing the tongue correctly, the plastic connector for recharging does not bother her.  She can run and dance in them without a problem.<br />I wrote review too soon.  Left shoe only holds charge for 1 hour.  Very disappointing.  Child didn't start wearing them until return period was past.  How can I get a new battery from seller?  Amazon has no way to contact the seller.  This must be corrected."
3.0,The item had an odor. I had to wash it because she said it really stinks.
3.0,It looks nicer in the photo but still cute. The snap closure is very secure abs strong. It looks very pretty on.
3.0,The boho gypsy style brown skirt is OK. It isn't as vibrant as the pictures shown here. It is rather dull. It is also rather long if you are petite like me. It doesn't interfere with my strides but I would have preferred it just around the ankle as shown in the pictures. I am 5 feet 3.5 inches for reference. It does wash easy. The color doesn't run which is a plus and I simply line dried it. I would probably recommend another color.
3.0,Nice gloves keep my. Hands warman.
3.0,"Looks nice, but showed up with bends in it already. Very sensitive. Once you push on any part of it, it stays bent."
3.0,Don't mean weist weise I mean length wise they fit small have to constantly pull my boxers down
3.0,This is a fantastic shirt. It does exactly what it says it does. BEWARE they run a little smaller. I got a large that’s what I wear. I followed the size chart and it should have fit perfectly on me. To small around hips.
3.0,These are OK. Nothing fancy. But it works for a sweet idea
3.0,Its very pretty nice material but my daughter is a 14 and i got the 14 and it definatly won't fit her. I am going to keep it though as a gift for my friends daughter :)
3.0,"I loved it, I used it for work, as a nurse I can switch it to 24 hours time for military . Co workers noticed it and loved it .The only thing I did not like is, band got scratched so easily with just simple use."
3.0,"I bought these for storage at home. These are nice cubes, but there is one side that is all mesh. I should have read description a little better."
3.0,"It's pretty for the price, but cheaply made and does leave your skin a little green. It worked perfect for what I needed it for."
3.0,I read a lot of reviews of this brand and then ordered a couple of pieces. This one arrived first. At first glance these are pretty but a closer looks leaves you wishing for more. The enamel part is great. But the stone looks scratched and dull. Even new plastic/ imitation stones have shine when brand new and unworn. This one just looks dirty and old. The wire at the back is crooked as it can be seen in picture and this pic taken when just received.<br />I won't be returning it because it is definitely a hassle to drive and drop a dime size thing.<br />For future purchases and customers be cautious. This wasn't a great buy.
3.0,"It does stay up better than most atrepless bras, but the cups are really pointy and make my boobs like like a weird shape when I wear it with most things"
3.0,"My baseball loving boys loved these. The red baseball helmet said “baserall” on it, so threw that one away."
3.0,"This jacket is of quality material; however, it is SO difficult to put on because the material inside the sleeves cling to tha material you are wearing. This is why I’m returning this wonderful, (probably) warm coat. My other coats all have material in the sleeves that let your arms slide in so you’re not fighting to put it on. The sleeves were a little long, but the bit throughout the the body was very good…and no question about it being warm."
3.0,I bought these earrings for my elderly mom and it was not what I expected.  I had to return it!
3.0,So very small. Had to return it. Seemed like a decent quality I guess but the section with sequins was not as described. In the photo the neckline looks quite open with a lot of sequins showing. In reality the cowlneck was covering the sequins way more. And the section with the sequins is just a loose fabric panel inside that shirt that slips and slides around.
3.0,I purchased this shirt to wear with leggings. It fits ok. The sleeves are very long. It will be a comfortable short for Fall.
3.0,"Jacket looks nothing like the pictures, and the sleeves are enormous (width and length). Jacket comes folded in a zip-loc bag, buttons only exist on one cuff, nothing like what I expected. I will say that it is stylish enough for a ""run-to-the-store"" jaclet, but I would never wear this if a colleague might see me.<br /><br />*EDIT* On second thought, this jacket is actually comfortable (even if it looks like a Halloween costume) and considering the price, it's not outrageous. If you have the money and don't mind spending it on a CHEAP jacket, then this is actually pretty good. I will definitely be wearing this casually when I don't want to damage a nicer jacket. Still mad about the image difference because it is extremely misleading, but you get what you pay for, and this is worth what I paid."
3.0,They are the typical JMS pantyhose.
3.0,Looks cute. Fabric is thinner than I thought it would be and is a little smaller (that's why I gave it a 3).
3.0,love these eerings...get alot of comliments
3.0,"I do like the band, but it stains so badly! I've had this for about 3 weeks. You can see the actual color on the piece that tucks inside. It's a crisp white. After 3 weeks the band is completely stained and looks pretty disgusting."
3.0,"This is the small, not bad. I usually wear a six, pretty fitted in the middle, everything else for ok. Wide scoop neck but still ok. Flare arms were okay but made layering tough. Soft material kinda thin. I like the color"
3.0,"The black 'athletic' socks are a joke.  I got these for my husband 10-13 size.  Hes about an 11 in sneakers.  He tried putting the black socks on and he couldn't even get them passed his toes!  He was hysterical laughing hes like I hope you didn't pay much for these socks.. He handed them to me and asked me to try them on.  I am a size women's 7.5 sneaker so I have feet half his size easily.  They just fit (not sure they will fit after washing)  and the lines on them cut into my feet in a strange way.<br />The white socks are great, fit fine and he loves them not to heavy not to light.  PERFECT!"
3.0,"I'm a bit disappointed with these as I feel Dr. Scholls is a reputable brand. They are nice and soft, but are very thin and I had several of the rubber grip pieces fall off during the first use."
3.0,Very cute. Broke after first wear
3.0,"Looks good from afar, but up close it looks and feels somewhat cheap. I've worn it for about a week now, and straps still feel very stiff."
3.0,a little small but cute and worth the price
3.0,For the price good safety glasses.  Not comfortable on my nose.
3.0,"This is very small in the shoulders, and I definitely don't have broad shoulders.  Fits more like it's for a teen instead of women's sizing.  For me going up a size wouldn't help...the rest of the dress fit fine and actually hangs pretty nicely."
3.0,cut but were way too small! Order like 2 sizes up.
3.0,Too stiff for me.
3.0,Loved these boots but the tongue stuck up too far and dug into my ankle. Very comfortable.
3.0,The tag on the hat didn't shown as Trailhead. It is kind tight.
3.0,Color was nice but size was way to big. The size large flopped on my 9 1/2 W feet
3.0,I wish I could get this in a size a little smaller.
3.0,Nice earrings but doesn’t sit flush on ear.
3.0,"Its a sock... a compression sock.<br /><br />Mother to daughter: &#34;What kind of person is your new boyfriend? Is he respectable?&#34;<br />&#34;Of course he is, Mom. He's thrifty, doesn't drink or smoke, has a very nice wife and three well-behaved children.&#34;"
3.0,Like the feel of the footbed on these shoes compared to their other styles. Not sure I like the way they tighten.  Having trouble keeping the cords tight.  I think Chaco's could have designed something a bit better for the money. Sent them back.  Disappointed in the turnaround time for a refund.
3.0,"Design and Price are the winners. Roman Numerals are perfect.<br />Material is cheap and lacks a lot of weight and thought, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,Fit as expected<br />Thin material
3.0,"i wear this headband 24/7. the horns are made of thick plastic that help it from snapping. the headband itself is covered with fabric, which makes it very easy for it to fall off, so ur not really able to look up unless u hold them.the horns have nice feeling to them, but they were slightly positioned wrong, but it doesn't bother me since people don't often look at tiny details."
3.0,"black detailing is nice. XL is very roomy, L size would have worked better for me."
3.0,"I cannot give 5 stars because I received black but needed navy blue. Needed for a dance, not enough time to exchange. Otherwise fit perfectly and look to be good quality"
3.0,"Very much like the watch, it does have larger band than expected but is still most comfortable and enjoyable to wear this spring"
3.0,"Sized for larger wrists.  If you have a small to medium wrist, prepare for an annoying dongle."
3.0,Bought this necklace to wear with a jacket that I have that has embroidered elephants on it.  It made the outfit look so put together.  The elephant is not too big or small.
3.0,"I completely LOVE(d) this bra. Side support, lift, straps, all perfect. I ordered black and nude. The only thing that is stopping me from reordering is the fact that the elastic in the seams came undone with the 3rd wash. Too expensive to repurchase for poor workmanship."
3.0,"My only complaint, get rid of those ridiculous looking pockets and you will have a solid piece of clothing.Either make them diagonal to go with the flow of the clothing or remove them."
3.0,They are super cute and fairly comfortable. The little loop on the back to aid in pulling them on ripped off the second I tugged on it to put them on for the first time though.
3.0,I like the socks but from the ball of the foot to the toes it's a little tight. I have fat toes so its hard to slide on the toe.
3.0,Kinda a weird fit doesn’t seem very comfortable. Haven’t worn it because I grab my better sports bras first but maybe I’ll get desperate enough to wear it. I do love the colors
3.0,"Love the colors and the print, very comfortable fabric. I bought this dress three different times to get right size. I normally where anywhere from med to lg. After reading reviews, I started with a xlg,,way too big so went to a large. Still too big so ordered med. little tighter than what I would prefer but still looks real nice."
3.0,was missing a stone and sets funny when you put it on &#34; or so says my wife&#34; it has a rounded back and she didn't like it for that reason. returned but it does look good.
3.0,"Thought would be thicker, but other than that the fit is on point."
3.0,Beautiful dress. I wore it to a funeral here in AZ.  Only thing I didn't like is it was below the knee on me.  I'm 5'2&#34;.
3.0,"Had this jersey for a while, but I just wear this first time.<br />Size and cutting. It is not the best cutting compare to my other 20+ jerseys in my draw. not as comfortable compare to other brand names as well.<br />Design is great, very eye catching. this win most to other brand names jersey on the market. most of the them are boring! The fabric is good no complain.<br />Zipper is the worst part, it pops open if I just zip them up like any other zipper. It will pop open easily. But instead, I have to find the position and lineup to zip, than it won't pop open."
3.0,"This canopy looks nice, but I ordered blue and this is definitely turquoise. The photo does make it look bluer than it is. I see one other customer had the same issue, so I'm not sure if they sent the wrong color or if this is what they call blue."
3.0,"I really like this, but it is small on my larger wrist, which is a bummer"
3.0,"Ordered for school for 10th grader, fit ok through chest but was too short to tuck in. If he raised his arms at all, his belly showed! Feels well made, but is 100% cotton so I’m sure it would need lots of ironing and would have shrunk even more. Returned them."
3.0,I don’t like it much it likes a kid toy .
3.0,Not what I expected! This is dressy and I wanted casual. Well made! Probably appropriate for a special event or during the holidays!
3.0,Like my ring fits well.but about a week one of the stones fell out
3.0,"One of them broke as soon as I tried it on and took it off, they're really fragile."
3.0,Cute. Cheaply made.
3.0,Little short so if your Tagus is swollen or thicker they won't fit. I had to wait a while before they if and were comfortable.
3.0,It's cute but it didn't fit so back it goes.
3.0,"These are my all time favorite gym pants, and being disabled, I wear them most of the time. As stated, this last pair are so long that they come up to my mid-chest. The must be designed for men that are six foot six inches tall."
3.0,"These are really cute but the paint started chipping right away and one of the rings broke within a week of me having it. Since they are so cheap I'd say they are worth it for the price, but the medium sized one will probably break right away especially if you are adjusting the size a lot."
3.0,"It is beautiful but came with the central stone detached, and some random stone having fallen out. The earrings were intact. Would not get as a gift unless you can fix it yourself. Does not seem worth the money to buy a 30 dollar broken necklace- kinda disappointed about that. However, after trying it on i have to say it is truly stunning even without the central stone- i may just keep it as is."
3.0,"Too bulky and heavy for me.  Therefore, I haven't worn it yet"
3.0,Lining not tacked down. Cheaply made.
3.0,"I'd like to say first of all that I have bought from Dan's Jewelers multiple times and I am a huge fan of their work and craftsmanship. And really, I have no problem with the craftsmanship here. The pendant is well-made, cool looking, and the cord is reliable. My only grief with this particular item is that it's so damn small and it absolutely looks terrible being so little. There's a lot of detail in this necklace and I think that the pendant should be much larger to show that detail."
3.0,"Fits fine... A little big in the calves, but i dont have big calves.  I got a medium, and i am 5'2&#34; and 120 pounds.  They dont keep you warm though!!  I had to put them under a second pair of pants, like long johns, to stay warm.. But that is kind of bulky.  I also dont like the metallic stripe at the bottom of the pants, and the zipper.  I didnt notice those in the picture."
3.0,Like this wallet only problem is my iPhoto 6plus Fell out the first day. Not good.
3.0,"Cute top, but it came without the bow."
3.0,the wait line didnt hit in a great spot
3.0,"This better be a Gag gift, at least for the one who gets the mouth side.."
3.0,The material for the front pockets is not like the pants material and already has holes.
3.0,Not a generous cut and very clingy.
3.0,the bracellet could get loose.
3.0,"Fits fine but material on the inside is itchy! But, will do for a quick workout and ok for the price."
3.0,"It's cool for the D&D aspect, cool for the nostalgia of a floating art piece, but the pen itself is cheaply made and cheap quality. Great for a stocking stuffers, keepsake but not for everyday use or something of longevity."
3.0,I selected a plus size.  While I like the material the adjustable straps do not adjust high enough particularly if your chest is larger.  The sides under the arms bulge out and being bustier there wasn't enough support to hold me in place under the padding.  I'll be returning the items as they just didn't work for me.
3.0,Pattern not consistently even.
3.0,Sizing runs small need to order a size bigger
3.0,Quality is ok material.
3.0,"Very cute, but no stretch in the waist. Medium too small, large to baggy. Would fit more people if there was stretch in the waist."
3.0,"This dress is quite large, despite ordering a small."
3.0,"if you don't wash them in cold water and line dry, you will end up with kuulots or knee knockers the legs will shrink 8 inchs!"
3.0,"I thought this would be a nice basic V neck t-shirt but nope.<br /><br />I ran this through the washer and dryer on perm press and it washed up fine except I think it might have gotten bigger.  Is that a thing????<br /><br />I am 5'6"" tall and a pear shape which means I carry my weight in the belly, derriere and thighs.<br /><br />I like a big comfy shirt but this shirt is sloppy big on the top and the pocket just hits very weirdly on me.<br /><br />This shirt is also very long which does cover the belly and derriere but it is also clingy so it doesn't really hide anything.<br /><br />This shirt has no shape--it just kind of hangs.<br /><br />It is just oddly cut for a larger size pear shape and with no substance, it just kind of wilts over the body.<br /><br />Not my favorite shirt by far.<br /><br />Made in China"
3.0,hard to use the reading part.  is too small to look through with out lots of work.
3.0,"Other than 1 set, everything else in small in size"
3.0,"This shirt is okay in terms of cut and fit. It loses stars for the fabric, which is heavier than it looks, and quite dense. This isn't a top to wear in the summer."
3.0,"I ordered these as Christmas gifts for family and co-workers.  The set came with two sets of cross earrings which are not pictured.  I didn't want any cross earrings.  I con't have time to return them because I have to mail packages asap.  The earrings look nice, but now I have two pairs that I can't use."
3.0,"They are slippers, and they are comfortable, however, the little band, or ring or whatever at the back of the shoe ends up being under my heel.  It's a good thing I went with the XX large shoe...they're on the verge of being too small for me."
3.0,kind of an odd dress
3.0,I thought the flowers were yellow when they are actually bright orange. Over priced as well
3.0,"Runs big, but it’s still cute"
3.0,"This is so adorable, I absolutely loved it!! Unfortunately, if fit everywhere but in the bust. I returned it. Had I ordered a larger size for my bust, I’m afraid it would had been too big everywhere else."
3.0,Nice belt but not true to size.  Much longer than expected.
3.0,"These are super cute, but the fabric is very thin. I bought them to wear in the fall, but most days it's too cold out to wear them (I live in California, too). I guess you get what you pay for: great deal, but cheaply made."
3.0,I bought these because a friend of mine has some she wears all the time and they look like real pearls.  These turned out to be larger and I wish they were more of an off white so they resembled real pearls more.  I do like them and the price was definitely a plus.  If the beads were just a tad smaller I would love them.
3.0,I like this L but it doesnt fix my  Bracelet and that was the point of me getting it so I had to put it on my chain  .the whole on this just dont go on the bracelet  wish i was  Disappointed cause that was the point of getting it
3.0,"Attractive pattern, style & color.  HOWEVER: the top is awkwardly-sized and shows alot of side-breast -- difficult to properly cover, even with an elastic back and adjustable straps (definitely not for the big-breasted). Typically wear Small (5'7 125lbs 34B), ordered Medium, and an adjustable-tie cinches the waist comfortably with no back-cheek show. Like the style and expect to keep, but will snip the back elastic to hopefully loosen the chest a bit."
3.0,its very short more of a shirt than a dress. and its very thin you can see through it. but the fit is pretty decent
3.0,Could have had a mylar cover on the tag. Exposed writing surface.
3.0,I ordered to have a choice of band colors.  The band came packaged nicely and appears of good quality but wish it would have had an option of different sizes.
3.0,when wet and dried the coating was hard and was not pliable. Cracked in the areas where fingers bent.
3.0,It is a single piece of molded plastic and the plastic is not as soft as I would like it especially the straps.  But overall it does the trick and keeps me from getting athletes foot and my health club
3.0,"Well, the laces hold my boots on, nice and snug.  They're boot laces, what more can I say.  They are soft, but seem durable so far.  they are softer than most military boot laces, but slide through the speed lace just fine.  I tuck my laces in, so my boot never comes untied regardless of the laces, so I don't know about that."
3.0,"Having them be adjustable is nice, but they still dont stay in very well"
3.0,The gown is too long for me. About 3 inches shorter would be perfect.
3.0,"In the past I've been really satisfied with most COOFANDY products, but I don't like this one as much. My first complaint is with the material. This isn't what you'd expect after reading that it's linen; to me it feels a lot like synthetic silk. It feels fine against your skin, but it makes the shirt less versatile and fashionable in my opinion.<br /><br />The shirt is also very boxy and baggy in the fit. I understand that it's to be expected with a casual shirt intended for beach wear, but it's baggier than I expected. It's a fine shirt and certainly unique, but it's just not for me. It certainly runs large so I'd suggest sizing down."
3.0,"I love the design and the light weight of the lanyard. Unfortunately, within a day of wearing it, the fabric started to unravel."
3.0,"The embroidery on this shirt is pretty but it makes the inside uncomfortable. My daughter can't stand it at all. She has to wear an undershirt beneath it.  The sleeves are a tiny bit shorter than I feel like most other shirts, but they're fine. It will be a good shirt with a t shirt under it."
3.0,I ordered these for my Dad's cousin.  86 years old.  Way too tight in comparison to the other brand similar pants I ordered.  The quality seemed nice but what a waste of money for me.  She lives in MN (I am in NJ) so the logistics of returning the pants just did not happen.  Not the manufacturer's fault but know these are small from my point of view.
3.0,"Very pretty, and well made, but just too small.  Even after ordering one size up, returning and ordering 2 sizes up, they were still too small."
3.0,This great looking hat was too small for my 7 5/8 sized head. Hat was very stiff and unyielding and sized more like a smaller size than how it was supposed to fit. I returned it.
3.0,Flimsy toy. Push pins bend easily. No torque.
3.0,"I really like this shirt except for the fact that they run small, I have wore a size 2XL shirt for many years ,so when I ordered this shirt thats what I ordered and the 2XL  fits very snug across the shoulders and chest and the reflective striping kind of feels like it binds you across the stomach when operating  a piece of equipment or driving truck. So do yourself a favor and buy the next size bigger. I had to take 2 stars away because of the poor fit ,if I pay $25.00 for a shirt I expect it to fit better than this shirt does. NUFF SAID."
3.0,Thet are very comfortable
3.0,Came with a rip in the seem already. But the fabric is so soft and I like them so much that I'm going to see it back so I can wear them
3.0,"Smaller than I expected. It’s an 80, whatever that means.  It’s cute, but I’m not expecting to get many wears out of it. Go two sizes up at least."
3.0,"These are a little weird. They run small and are soft, not slick. Like lulu roe leggings more so than the shiny athletic type material. They don’t seem like they would last a long time, but I washed them and forgot about them in my laundry full of black clothes so I didn’t get a chance to return them. If they fit better I would wear them to the store, but wouldn’t want to do anything where I would sweat in them because of how soft they are."
3.0,I like this but the screws easily breaks into half
3.0,Too sheet to wear with just a bra.
3.0,"for the price, this is great. They are inexpensive, and you get what you pay for. I put in the first one and it lasted maybe 10 days before the stone fell out while I  was at work. Luckily I have 4 back ups!"
3.0,Fits weird. Thinks that's related to the cut. I had to wear a tank  underneath the shirt. Felt over exposed.
3.0,dress was not true to size
3.0,These are cute but a little too big for my head.
3.0,"Cheap material and cheaply made. Looks nothing like the photo. However, it fits and arrived allot sooner than anticipated."
3.0,"Has a feel a bit like polyester,  it doesn't really stretch and it runs small. I love the pattern on this item, but it's a bit stiff and although it has a softer lining on the inside,  its stiff and scratchy on the outside.  I wish that a better description of what type of material and whether it runs small or large were provided in the item description.  That being said it arrived quickly as promised."
3.0,I thought they were a little pricey - but my granddaughter loved them!
3.0,The poor quality of the fabric and the odor of the dress was unbearable. Will be returning...
3.0,It’s very shiny but not that great of quality. It works for my filing cabinet key ring at work.
3.0,Super cute. Im 5'9&#34; so fit shorter than I wanted and I bought xl hoping it would be longer. Still wearing it
3.0,"The skirt is beautiful and thick, unfortunately it has a large slit on the back. The slit is to large not appropriate for the office. Had to return it."
3.0,The adhesive strips that came with the product didn't work at all but I used polygrip and they stayed in fairly well. Kinda cheap but I didn't expect movie quality. I could talk with them in and that was good.
3.0,I'm 5'2 and they didnt reach my ankle run short other wise fit nice but gave them away
3.0,There is no label anywhere in the shirt to show the size. It was pretty big on my son who fits in Cat & Jack size 2T. It is very cute though and my son picks it out of his drawer after it gets cleaned.
3.0,"It's a nice watch band and my husband says it's more comfortable than a different one he got, but the orange is only on the inside on the band where it won't be seen at all. I bought it in a rush and didn't scroll through all the pictures, otherwise I would've seen that it's just a black band and bought the other version which is an orange band with black on the inside. If you want to see the orange, don't buy this one! Otherwise, it's a great band."
3.0,The Cute Bird Dress its too thin and it was to large. It looks like wearing a mattress when you are wearing it. The actual dress is different from the image.
3.0,"Skirt to big, looked odd. Didn’t care for the cut so o returned"
3.0,"I'm really torn up about this one.  I love the watch, everything it does is great. But the band itself has caused what looked like chemical burns. I didn't take pictures and my friends told me that was stupid of me. Sadly,  I can't wear it for this reason."
3.0,Material on the grey is thinner than black. Both are soft and fit well. Long enough that they don’t ride up
3.0,I don't like that it doesn't give stability all it does is squeeze you but no support. It does rise on the legs so it doesn't stay in place I've even tried raising it to see it that will help but it still does the same thing.
3.0,"The material felt too "" synthetic"". It wasnt soft at all."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:8f9d972a7a2528616c77bdbd72cf93e3]] Well I had high hopes for this tiny wallet. But it comes with no instructions about how to use the inside pockets. One smaller pocket which I assume is for the folded bills had a un-sewn tab which looked out of place to me. On the other side there was a larger pocket which I assume was for the cards. I tried 6 cards and it was a bit tight with the six cards. I have another 7 cards which I tried in the center section without a pocket and the whole wallet was tight to close then. I am going to return it and go back to my shark clip which can hold 13-14 cards split into two groups some in the front and some in the back along with the bills
3.0,"Although very cute, the 4T ran small and barely fit a toddler girl who wears 3t."
3.0,I ordered a size above my measurements just to be safe and the product still came in too small. I’m very disappointed... I had to give them to my sister who is about 50 ibs lighter than me and they are little big on her. I ordered a 5
3.0,It was a cheap stocking stuuffer. Did its job! Well that's what shd
3.0,The pants kept sliding down on my butt. I kept having to pull them up. Not cool. Other then that I have no complaints but that’s a biggie!
3.0,"These do a good job absorbing sweat and are somewhat soft, but they are a little tight on my head.  I am a man about 6 foot tall and 200 pounds and these fit my head because of the elastic, but I feel like it cuts off circulation a little bit and isn't comfortable for long workouts.  Maybe I just have a big head?"
3.0,Nice Colors were brighter than I thought they would be.
3.0,"Runs small, but very cute if your short"
3.0,They all looked amazing. But only two fit correctly. The other two were a little small and just felt really weird. Almost scratchy.
3.0,"I lost my keys after 14 years so I needed a new wrist keychain and decided on these. They are very thin and not the quality of those that are sold in stores. Luckily they have several in the pack because I think you'll need them. They definitely will not last 14 years, maybe not even 2. I'd say try to find in store but these as a last resort."
3.0,Did not like this material. It is not cotton and seems very hot. Will not be using :(
3.0,"Very cute, but not made for small wrists. Could not get it tight enough to lie on my wrist without sliding."
3.0,"I like the men’s fit and that of zipper pockets but don’t like the pocket lining on this pr,I do have a very similar pair but with cotton lining which I prefer but these are good too and worth the money"
3.0,"This is decent quality, but not worth the price in my opinion. Pretty thin material and SHEDS EVERYWHERE! The head sheds so bad, you get the little hairs in your eyes when wearing it. Its not bad but I expected much better quality for the price."
3.0,Adorable leggings! Ran small.
3.0,I have to say I was surprised that they weren't anty glare because they said they were but I like the style
3.0,not so good the quality but it's ok in that price.
3.0,Pretty flimsy for the price. I guess I'm paying for the brand name
3.0,"The item is not as pictured: The buttons don't actually button, so the shirt is very low cut."
3.0,Love the looks of the hat but it wasnt actual trucker hat material like I was expecting. Material was much thinner.
3.0,"fit nicely, loved back, fabric showed everything needed spanx under it and it wasn't a tight fitting dress"
3.0,Can't wear it because it is too big for my 5.5 inch wrist.
3.0,"So cute, but a little bit too small for me. I'm 5'6 165 38DD. It is the perfect length, I was just hoping for something more flowy, less form fitting. This is definitely form fitting on my body. Unfortunately, I am too big for it to look cute :(<br />I am keeping it in hopes that my gym efforts will work out and I'll be able to wear it.<br />All-in-all it's really cute, but not if your trying to hide a tummy."
3.0,Quality & fit are great. I rated this a 3 because the nike logo which looks grey in the picture is actually black & white stripes. Ordered for my husband & he wasn't a fan so we ended up regifting.
3.0,"The &#34;L&#34; is to long, it sticks out of my nose and have to rotate it to go up my nose."
3.0,"I liked it , just to big"
3.0,"Loved initially but it has now stretched out and when I washed it, the metal rim ring has torn through."
3.0,Too big for my luggage can’t return. Useless
3.0,The set is beautiful and the material is super soft. I really wish it fit me. I gifted it. Too pretty to return. Size was wayyy to small.
3.0,Not supportive enough for running.
3.0,Very pretty but a lot larger than expected. I received some compliments but a few people stated that they thought I had something wrong with the back of my ears. The color blended in with my skin tone.
3.0,"Cute as shown, a tad bit big but cute."
3.0,Pay attention to the details. These are basically 100% polyester. Slinky. A little sheer. Shiny. Seems decent aside from that. Haven't tried em on yet. Will update.
3.0,"It states to order a size up...I did that...had to return...ordered size down and it was still a little large! Not returning again, so I will sew it to make it fit! But otherwise really cute!!"
3.0,"It's a nice color and good material, but very small with very big poof on the shoulders. Didn't look proportionate on me so returning. Ordered x-small which is normally my size."
3.0,They were not as pictured. Much shorter and the snack is really small. My son still loved them.
3.0,Cute top but the sleeves are super long
3.0,"Love the print but, the material is thin."
3.0,Not good quality but what do you expect to a cheap product like this. Get what you pay.
3.0,"shorts fit ok,  top did not, however, this company was quick to resolve."
3.0,Runs extremely small.  After reading the previous reviews i decided to order 2 sizes larger but unfortunately it was still too small.
3.0,I am larger busted with a small frame so this dress was terribly unflattering. I like Umgee and overall recommend their clothing but this was a no-go for me.
3.0,Dark vision
3.0,Very cool design. Legibility is a concern however. The watch is difficult to read in bright light and in dim light. An overcast day and inside is best - unless there is a bright overhead light inside.
3.0,Wish it closed up in the middle.
3.0,"Mousepad was delivered folded, and the crease still hasn't gone away.<br />The design is also rather faded. Much less contrast; the black is more a dark grey and the nautilus isn't as vibrant as it is in the picture."
3.0,The band was way too loose and the cups were way too small despite referencing measurements before ordering.
3.0,I really wanted 100% Cotton. I wish I found out BEFORE I ordered this jean skirt that it is NOT 100% cotton.
3.0,"Love the color and design, but the size runs big."
3.0,This product is not big enough for the google Chrome stadia and the controller
3.0,"They don't stay in place on my ears, constantly slide down and hang.  Fortunately have a piecing I can add a second earring to anchor the earring."
3.0,Good price. Ultraviolet protection is real.
3.0,"I thought it was way over-priced at $62.00....the quality is just OK...my husband, who will be wearing it, is satisfied and that is why I didn't return it."
3.0,I thought this was going to be an a line Tunic well just a basic long T-shirt that’s a little bit sloppy type T-shirts
3.0,"This is a review of TOMIDOO Men's Military Tactical Pants Lightweight Cargo Work Pants Outdoor Water-Resistant Hiking Pants with Pockets (Black, M). I thought these pants would be at least a little thicker despite the ""lightweight"" claim. They wrinkle easily and swish around when you move and overall I just didn't find them comfortable. They are too thin to do any kind of hiking or outdoor work because I can see it ripping easily, and it offers little protection because it feels so thin."
3.0,It was a nice headband but it's not as fancy as it looks on the picture! It more of a headband that you would use for a casual party not a wedding or prom.
3.0,my daughter is very petite so this dress is to small have to alter to much of hassle to return.
3.0,they &#34;work&#34;
3.0,The bra is padded -Which I do not like
3.0,"What looks like one blue piece in the picture really looks like 3 separate pieces in real life. Somewhat takes away from the quality in my opinion. They're also very stiff to open and close. I won't use them much, but I hope they don't break too soon."
3.0,"Half of them didn't work on delivery. They are difficult to turn on. But the size is perfect for little hands, costumes or putting in my purse."
3.0,Recieved the necklace but no cross on either necklace
3.0,"I expected a Black ski jacket, all black.<br />It is rather blue (which would also be fine) and has black front and pocket lines. very upset, not what expected."
3.0,"I'm giving them 5star for ease of return.<br /><br />But overall, not a very flattering dress for my body type."
3.0,"This swim suit is so cute.  The quality is great, too.  I'm  so sad that it fits almost two sizes too big.  It is way larger than my normal XXL swim suits. So, I had to take the ratings down because of that.  Now, I have to ship it back.  I hope it doesn't cost as much as the suit its self."
3.0,Basically if you can’t fit your fingers around your leg don’t buy this
3.0,It's what I would expect for $12.00 so I got what I expected!
3.0,"They are beautiful, but the posts bend easily when putting the backs on.  Concerned with how long they'll last."
3.0,"I like the shirt, BUT for me, the snaps are too tight to close with one hand. Maybe if I was a guy, I could do it."
3.0,"they look different from the picture on the website, but seem fine and deliver the function"
3.0,It is a lot darker than in the picture.
3.0,"It was a bit small. Great material,but it wouldn’t stay on my head."
3.0,Disappointed at the fit. If ordering consider<br />a size bigger. May return it and get a larger size.  Like the style and material.
3.0,Very thin. Very large (bought it the size she wears). But absolutely adorable.
3.0,"These are inexpensive for a reason.  Quite a few didn't work, and I think the connection on the switch was bad.  I went through and threw away some, only to find they came on in the garbage can, but they wouldn't turn back off.  It's OK for the cost, but I have had better."
3.0,"Nothing bad, but just not spectacular.  I found it hard to use.  It wanted to slip off my shoulder with every step."
3.0,"I’m not a huge fan of jumpsuits because I always feel like I jiggle too much in them.  But this looked really cute so I thought I’d give it a try.  I am typically a small, but ordered medium as a lot of Asian made clothes tend to run small.  I think the small would have been too small, so definitely order a size up.  It looks decent on, I’m still not 100% comfortable with the jiggle factor, but I will try it for a brunch and see how things go.  The material is soft and flowy and the pockets are a nice touch."
3.0,I returned this because the pattern on the one I got was very different with white spots in strange places.
3.0,but I just don't like that there are two loops instead of one
3.0,"It is bigger than I thought, but it is nice."
3.0,"Not true to size, I needed 2x I should have gotten 5x but beautiful"
3.0,The only thing these glasses really do is make things yellow. I doesn't help much with blinding lights at night or night glare.
3.0,Color is definitely a brighter cobalt blue not anything close to navy.
3.0,"It doesn't look exactly as it appears in the photo, and the quality is pretty sub-par."
3.0,"This belt is pretty good quality, I wear a size 18 jeans and ordered the largest size, it was still a bit small, so I added two extra holes."
3.0,"This is not a bad looking hat. And the material is pretty sturdy, which is good for a sunhat. And the price is not bad at all. Unfortunately, the hat does not work. The material is too floppy for this cut and the hat is sort of shapeless. I actually like the design, in a way -- there's a hint of flapper to it and a hint of hippie to it and a hint of old-school East Coast beach-lady to it. But it isn't any one of them because it can't hold a shape. Too bad. Not a wreck, but not great, either."
3.0,Definitely pay attention to how big these actually are. They were way bigger than I expected!
3.0,A little cheap looking
3.0,"Cute, though nothing special. They get the job done."
3.0,"Really cute but the fabric on the bottom of the shoe will become shredded after wearing and start to come off that you just need to rip it all off yourself. There was no point of them to put it there. Once ripping it off, you’ll need to scuff up the bottom of the shoes or you will slip and slide around when walking on tile."
3.0,"Shoe was at least a half size too big and sloppy width compared to my normal size in most shoes. Also, quality just ok."
3.0,"3 stars because I like it, but it's way to big!"
3.0,"I love the color but the face us a lot smaller than advertised but it’s okay if your working out or have an outfit that matches it I wear it every day for working out and it matches my university blue Jordans with a baby blue polo shirt just beware it can’t be worn with a long sleeve it’s band is not strong enough and there’s a risk it will pop off or get crooked if you try to wear it with a long sleeve  prolonged time it only works with shirts or sleeveless shirts but honestly, I will just go with other Casio watches because the size advertised for the face is not the same size as other Casio watches that have the same face size advertised other Casio watches, have a way bigger face even though they claim this watch face is the same size sometimes I feel like it’s a little kid version of a men’s Casio watch so be advised to be careful to do YouTube diligence because none of the pictures or the videos on Amazon can actually properly show the size of the face"
3.0,They aren’t as good as the price. Should be $20.
3.0,"Nice bag, but the strap is pretty much useless - uncomfortable and difficult to carry around on your shoulder."
3.0,"I buy small or medium for looose fit. I bought all three colors for this jacket in small and tried only navy blue. Can barely button it, it is more like x-small. The smell is unbearable, the jacket is wrinkled and does look as fancy as the picture on Amazon page. I did not try two other colors but they all smell. The black one looks washed out a bit, corners on the collar lost some black color. The fabric is not too thin and it is good for light summer jacket.<br />I give it three stars because, if you buy it one or two sizes up, wash it, iron it, and replace the buttons (maybe buy same color or whatever matches your pants or skirt, instead of the gold ones), it will be OK to wear. The price is good, and it is pure cotton."
3.0,Leather will increase the overall size of the watch on your wrist and makes it hard to have long sleeves over it.
3.0,"This dress is beautiful! But sadly, I'm dropping two stars because I was only able to wear it once. I had it on for perhaps four hours after my wedding and during those four hours, three of the buttons fell off! I was able to sew two back on with an emergency sewing kit, but one went MIA and without the buttons, the dress no longer has the same style. I sadly never got a full photo of the dress before the button fiasco. Someday I may attempt to buy new buttons and replace them, but it's likely going to be one of those projects I'll never get to. :("
3.0,"The letters are glued onto the choker and not very well. I like it, but guess I’ll have to upgrade it. The choker should have been made like the key ring so the letters wouldn’t come off. Can’t use it during bdsm if you’re choked."
3.0,The only complaint is that the colors aren't assorted.  I received six identical olive green ones and had wanted different colors as advertised.
3.0,"Got the wrong size, too tight"
3.0,Needed for a concert ! Was worth the price ! Perfect for the event !!
3.0,"I ordered the medium vest originally, which was too large. Then I ordered a small....they're both the exact same size. They seem to heat up just fine, but if it's so loose, I wonder how well it would actually keep me warm."
3.0,Very loose fitting.
3.0,"not the same fabric that my daughter got when she ordered it a year earlier. mine is softer, fuzzier,  hers does not pill. i bought mine back in november i think."
3.0,The ear rings are really cute but the hooks change colors too fast
3.0,"I bought the size 0-2Y for my 11.5 month old child. For reference, her head circumference has been in the 35th percentile at each well-child visit, so smaller than average.<br /><br />Stars: 3/5 total——>2/5 stars for sizing and poor fitting/grip of sunglass strap, 4/5 stars for how cute the glasses are. The glasses appeared to fit perfectly, which means she won’t get prolonged use of them during/after the summer. Even using the strap and attaching it at the ends of the glasses gave a snug fit around her head (plus they don’t stay attached to the glasses well whatsoever and are VERY easy for my daughter to remove).<br /><br />For the expensive price, short use of a product she doesn’t even keep on her head isn’t worth it. I plan on returning them and investing in a sun hat for now. If you want them, consider sizing up or just dishing out a lot of money for glasses your child may only wear for a few months or lose because the straps don’t grip well (yes I know the product replacement guarantee)."
3.0,I wear silver pendants daily. This chain is very lightweight and lacks the shine I was hoping for.
3.0,"The photo makes it look really thin, but I'd say it's pretty much an average thickness for this type of watch. I'm replacing a Swatch that was at least 1/2 the thickness of this one, maybe more (but I can't find it online).<br /><br />Also, the band on this watch, while easily adjustable, is huge. I'm 6'2&#34; and 185 pounds, and the band would fit a wrist double the circumference of mine. After adjusting, the 'leftover' strap doubles under the main strap which is kind of clunky.<br /><br />So if you have big wrists and don't care that much about the thickness, then you'l \l probably like this watch. Otherwise you might end up returning it like I did."
3.0,this shoe runs about a half size to small
3.0,"I like the look of the bracelet, nice color and appears to be in good shape except that the magnet that hold the bracelet together fell out before I even wore it!  My husband glued it back in, lets see how it holds up."
3.0,"I love the idea of this and my daughter loved it as a gift but not too long after receiving it, the glass bead fell out of the charm.  We ended up just super gluing it back in, but wish it had been better quality to begin with."
3.0,Cute dress just not on me.
3.0,"Looks okay. The gold is nice and polished. The chain is an okay quality. Not bad, just not super great."
3.0,"Read many reviews stating this was too small and to order a size up...which i did. I usually wear a medium comfortably and wanted this baggy so it could fall off the shoulder. The large allows for the look i am going for, but only got 3 stars because the material isn't anything special and is a bit see through. Will be great for fall."
3.0,I liked the wood necklace but the color was much darker that I received.  Disappointed.
3.0,Way too small!  Max is about a USA size 16.
3.0,"Watch band is colorful, comfortable, and stylish. Only complaint I have is that the tassel fell off after only 4hrs after I put the band onto my watch, and with the strings being so short I couldn't tie them back on."
3.0,The arms were restrictive and it wasn’t flattering like I thought it would be.
3.0,Returned item. Size is inaccurate. Nice looking item though!
3.0,"Good quality fabric, nice colors, but good golly it has a LOT of padding and underwiring AND boning on the side. If you have really big breasts it would be more suitable. I took the boning on the side out and the underwire is tried to come out on its own first time I wore it so I took that out as well. Considering cutting the padding out too."
3.0,"The material was thin, but it still kept me warm. It was a cute last minute purchase for my trip to New York."
3.0,Unfortunately way too small. I always wear extra large but could not get them on pass my hips.
3.0,The band is huge on this watch and you'll have to have it adjusted. The display is bright and it's fun to use.
3.0,"Fit as expected, however it not very supportive."
3.0,"I love the design and feel. The neck (18.5) and sleeve (36)  lengths seem to be spot on for me (6'3&#34;, 230), but it has almost 2 feet of extra fabric around my stomach, and I'm not exactly slim."
3.0,"I should've returned it, and maybe get a smaller size, but I didn't think about it until it was too late.  It's not as flattering as the photo makes it seem.  It was thick and well made though."
3.0,Love how supportive this bra is. Actually going to buy 2 for each one of my 4 girls for Christmas<br />Very comfortable and supportive but doesn’t last long. I purchased 4 of these. I wear them most of the time and one of the straps broke within about 2 weeks. I returned it for the same item. Sadly a second strap broke today.. unfortunately out of the return window.
3.0,Like the shoes but they seem overpriced based on the material. The shoe feels exactly like ribbon. Not sturdy.
3.0,I've had elephant pants that I bought in Thailand.  The fabric on these is inferior to those -  not sure how they'll hold up.  But they're comfy and I enjoy wearing them.
3.0,"The rhinestone kept cutting the top of my mouth, it takes a bit to get used to honestly. It's metal, I was hoping for plastic."
3.0,Very simple I was going to wear it for my wedding but it just wasn’t dressy enough.
3.0,"It didn't fit as I was expecting, and it wasn't very comfortable feeling, I returned it, and was given a refund quickly."
3.0,It was just ok. Needs altering but can do the job if you just need sequins
3.0,Difficult to wrap around a small women's ring.
3.0,"My boys love these socks, but the heel wears quickly. Too thin for little active boys and wore out too quick."
3.0,Weird fit. Material not soft
3.0,It's a cute little piece. Definitely NOT Durable! But if you're going for a cute fun piece then you'll be Happy with this!!
3.0,"I feel like this would look best on smaller sizes.  I tried it on and immediately took it off.  I love wearing dresses but this by no means was flattering to my figure personally.  I still gave it a 3 because the dress itself is a pretty dress, just a little stiffer than I expected it to be."
3.0,This is just one long chain and not a multi layer necklace as described. I put the necklace on and it broke very easily. I was able to get pliers and fix.<br /><br />I know this is a cheap knock off... But at least describe it correctly.
3.0,"This is a lovely necklace, however, the anchor can EASILY fit through the heart and it's very easy to lose.  It has opened up on my neck several times the first day I wore it.  I am looking for a way to fix it so that it cannot separate so easily."
3.0,"Estoy inconforme con el color ya que no es el que se ve en la fotografía de la publicación, la calidad de la tela es mucho mejor que otras mallas de la misma marca que he probado... Pero le doy tres estrellas porque el color no es el que yo quería"
3.0,One of them came in deformed but they did come in earlier than expected.
3.0,"They are supposed to be non slip, but my grandson slips on the hardwood floor."
3.0,item as described but beads were falling off right from the package
3.0,It fits the face kinda weird. I had to shorten the straps on the bottom.
3.0,"Chain essentially broke after a month. Like, not the keyring, the chain it was connected to. Additional cost to replace is expected, but still. Kinda knew what I was getting into anyhow, and the item still looked nice."
3.0,This belt runs small.  Order a size or two bigger.  Ordered the normal size and it was 3 sizes too small.
3.0,Tiny necklace
3.0,The width made them a size bigger
3.0,Decent but tangles easily.
3.0,The rings look nice but are not as shiny as I expected.  They are also wider than they look.  I have short fingers so it is a close fit to my first knuckle.  I will be wearing them to the Cardinal games.  Go Cardinals!
3.0,"Unfortunately, I had an unremarkable first impression with this clip...  The CZs are extremely tiny and not really noticeable. I was a bit disappointed. (Although admittedly I have never actually seen the Pandora clip for comparison)<br /><br />The clip looks good on the bracelet and appears to be secure fit. And I'm sure that it will look even better once I link my bracelets.<br /><br />For $27 you can't go wrong but I think that my expectations were a bit too high.  (I know, &#34;What were you expecting for $27?&#34;)<br /><br />I'd rate this clip a 3.5...don't love it enough to say 4 stars. But honestly I doubt that I'd love the Pandora clip any more. Probably even less at $50-$100 (according to eBay).  If you need a double clip this is DEFINITELY the way to go."
3.0,Do not know &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; its for a friend
3.0,Very pretty but even 4x is small!
3.0,Arrived with one lens scratched.
3.0,It seems in a decent size but it’s big when u open the box I wasn’t expecting the big size of it otherwise it’s ok
3.0,"The dress was way too open in the front, and the fabric felt very nylon-y"
3.0,"This weighs nothing, verrrrry packable if you are a hiker, was very warm I used it in the smokies in dec this year. The downside is the facial hole is fine when wearing but smallish when trying to pull it over the back of your head and down around your neck like a neck warmer. [Or just when your head gets too warm]"
3.0,I really like the appearance of this toe ring.  It looks well made.  Maybe my toes are large but I can't wear it without pinching when I walk.
3.0,The hat wings got a bit damaged when received
3.0,"Great for the price. It was quick to start wearing and tearing after about a handful of wears. Actually wearing it now with my outfit. Overall, I like it."
3.0,Fit tighter than I expected it to.
3.0,"The fit and feel was good, but.... It was short. Ordered correct sizing and liked how it fit everywhere but length. Arms up- belly shirt."
3.0,"I am perfectly willing to accept that we are kind of fussy, but upon taking this dress out of the packaging, my first reaction was that these look like surgical scrubs with bananas all over them. I would think I'm crazy except then my husband wandered over and said the exact same thing. While the fabric does have stretch Inc., there's a weird slickness or lack of flexibility here, and the coloration is definitely reminiscent of scrubs. While the bananas are cute, they don't make quite enough of the statement to overcome that association. The flutter sleeves are nice, and the shape is very forgiving and generous for different body shapes.<br /><br />The stretches of the kind that it doesn't give until you kind of push it, and then the stretch comes into play. It's not just soft and forgiving everywhere, it's more that if you go to sit down, it does stretch and flex a little bit.<br /><br />For me personally, I was disappointed in the type of fabric and my daughter didn't care for the feel of it at all. It is well-made and nicely sewn, so if you can get over the fabric, this is a nice enough dress."
3.0,"Nice bracelet and great gift for first communion. Wish it had more charms like the larger versions, but it is pretty and a great way to encourage little girls to explore their faith."
3.0,It was a nice color just didn’t look good on short person.
3.0,Wish it wasn’t so heavy
3.0,True to size and material is comfortable and of good quality.
3.0,Material was thin and a bit see-through. Also hugged my body more than I’d like. Pretty purple color. Returned it for another style.
3.0,Fit nice look well.
3.0,"Bought this for school camp, because my daughter wears swimsuit most of the day. The underwear part that is under the skirt is very loose and I ended putting another swim suit bottom underneath so my daughter’s privets won’t be visible to everyone when she sits."
3.0,"Well, I had it for about 9 months. I don't honestly know what happened (no sneaky pets or kids to break it), but it shattered. In so many pieces and slivers, which made it super fun to try to get my jewelry out.<br />It was not dropped, I'm pretty sure my purse was on it. I'm not one of those people with huge purses. I don't have that much to carry. It must have hit it just right. So bummed, and bandaid covered."
3.0,Really cute but the rose fell off after a few weeks. I never found it.
3.0,The glasses were NOT oversized by any stretch of the imagination. Gave it away to my small face niece.
3.0,"thinner material than i like, but they will do for some times."
3.0,"I had ordered silver shoes, however they were defective, so I returned the bag as well!"
3.0,I ordered based on the sizing chart of the company. It is snug and the belt that came with it is way to small. It’s like them made it the exact same size as the skirt - but didn’t stop to think that real people are actually round and not flat.
3.0,Colors provided not that exciting.
3.0,"Pearl is okay I guess. I didn't get the joy of opening my oyster, the pearl was just floating in the water because the oyster was already opened, makes you wonder if the pearl was planted in the oyster before hand."
3.0,They are nice and comfortable but the front area was too small for me otherwise I would accept him gave him more stars
3.0,ss applicator smaller than I thought
3.0,This will keep you warm but not a stylish as it looks in pictures
3.0,Its right ribbon rack for Air Force. The product is good enough for the job.
3.0,I missed where it said wool material<br />Too hot for the summer.
3.0,Size is cut small.
3.0,"I ordered a 2xl and usually wear a xl, it was still a hair too tight. The fabric was poor and thin, although not see through. I debated keeping the dress but my uncertainty about it caused me to send it back."
3.0,Looks nice but several months later the ribbed sleeve cuffs and band around bottom have turned an off white yellow color. Going to try oxygen clean and see if it helps. (Only wore once to work)
3.0,Beautifully made dress. Too large for 8-10.
3.0,"Look okay, fit well, lots of stretch. But they feel cheap and I’m constantly pulling them up! Plumbers crack is a serious fear when wearing these! I love the look of them, though! They are a great way to get through the summer cheaply!"
3.0,Cheap material.. But light for the hotter days.
3.0,"Dress was too tight over the chest, which made it sheer in that area. Print is beautiful."
3.0,Was beautiful and fit well my daughter loved it. Zipper spilt at the end of the night though
3.0,Well made and cute.  But it looks better on the hanger than the child.
3.0,"Looks nice, but bulky. Not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time."
3.0,The ear peace is already broken
3.0,It was small.  You can see through the material so you would have to wear a shirt under.  Love the color of this and the design just small.
3.0,Llego manchada de maquillaje
3.0,Not at all pink or blue. They are clear.
3.0,"Decent price for 5 pairs of gauges, blue and red are transparent just in case you can't tell from the picture. Light comfortable and they have a big wearable if you need that, if not you may find that they like to wander around your lobe if your lobes are smaller, this can be solved by stretching an o-ring over the flares and letting it rest in the middle then your ear will rest between one flare and the o-ring which will keep them from sliding around."
3.0,Good but cheap material
3.0,I love the idea of these. Very hard to lace.  They are too tight for an adult. Might work for child
3.0,"I loved it when I got it, but everything fell off from the hat. I'll have to reglue it onto the hat."
3.0,"This shirt is not a ladies cut so if you're expecting a fitted/slim cut shirt, this is not that.  I think it is a women's cut shirt, but it's a relaxed fit and boxy.  Not the style I was looking for but the shirt was a good quality and the printing was done well.  Cute, but not for me."
3.0,"Cute design, but the shirt color was too yellow for ""fall"" shirt design. Could not tell that until I received the shirt, so based on that reason only, I returned the shirt."
3.0,They were just a little snug.
3.0,The size I chose is bigger than it's supposed to be.
3.0,I love the design of this tank but size wayyyyyyy up.  I like my workout tanks a little long and the bottom of this barely makes it to my hips
3.0,"This dress did not fit at all. It ran way too small (about 2-3 sizes), & was too long in length. I ordered 1 size above what the size chart recommended, & I almost couldn’t get it buttoned. The style of the dress is cute, & the material is a nice quality denim. I returned the dress."
3.0,Very cute shoe. Too small. Will reorder in larger size. Great value for price
3.0,"The color was not red and white. Its more of a burgundy  and light gray.  Very disappointed  with color, however the product is soft and feels good"
3.0,"Oh man I wanted to love this dress. It fits perfectly, it's so cute, not too long, but the white part is super see-through, and also the material wrinkles SO easily that it can never be used for travel. Such a shame."
3.0,These are nice just a bit too tight to slip the tie in. Otherwise my husband loved them!
3.0,This was Waaaaay too small.  It wouldn't even cover me up as far as a swim suite cover goes.... BUT.... I ended up wearing it as a cover for my elegant dress!  It is way cute and it went perfectly as a shawl/ jacket (really light.)  Order 1-2 sizes bigger then what you usually wear.
3.0,"I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered three WOOSEA dresses in size small. Two of them fit but this one was really tight. The fabric is shiny looking which I didn't like the look of. I returned it."
3.0,It’s fine for how cheap it was. I don’t like that it isn’t sturdy. It flips around while I wear it and the strap isn’t comfortable. But I’m allowed in stadiums with all my crap!
3.0,"I like the look and they are comfortable if lounging, but be forewarned they're very thin. Cannot use comfortably in boots and would not be good for running or longer waks in athletic shoes. These would probably be fine with dress shoes (but I don't wear dress shoes). Description of product should be more upfront about the thickness... Half as thick as a regular crew sock."
3.0,"Light weight material and very comfortable. I am a size medium / small but ordered a medium. I received many compliments on this at work. Recently, the strap broke as a bent down to put lotion on my leg... go figure."
3.0,"I just received these s days tried them on. Noting a slightly greasy costing that ribbed off in my hands, I thought I'd give them a quick soak in plain, cold water. When I came back, the water was black. I'm going to have to wash them in machine. There's no way I'd wear these and risk more color coming off on my skin or on my car seat in the way to or from working out."
3.0,Didn't like the feel of the fabric.
3.0,"Works well. But the band really is quite long, like other reviewers noted.<br /><br />Update: This thing really got STANKY. And it's really difficult to put on and remove as it's lacking the little toggle on the inside of the band that allows you to pull the pin back. I'm now using a breathable silicone band and liking it so much better. Changing to another band also made me realize how very stiff this nylon band is...it never really loosened up after months of wear.<br /><br />Another update: The company reached out to me, offered and issued a refund. The customer service is appreciated."
3.0,i like this wallet..very sleek and looks like real leather..but after i put my cards in and the other things in my wallet..it wont stay closed!!
3.0,My Fiance picked this ring for her engagement ring.picture is misleading as far as size of stones but other than that she's a happy camper
3.0,"It's a nice belt, but the small hangs on my hips in he tightest eyelet, and it came with a bug fat warning that this product causes cancer and birth defects, so I returned it."
3.0,So cute but soooo little. And I wear a small and this is just...wow. very tiny
3.0,You can see trough
3.0,"Very long if you're petite.  It's long even if you're not petite.  Pretty skirt, waistband runs a little smaller than expected, and it's not elastic, so that's something to keep in mind. Looks exactly as pictured."
3.0,Thought it would be bigger not what I was looking for I will give it as a gift.
3.0,"I was debating buying this suit, it looks really great on the model, but, as excepted, the fit isn't as flattering in real life.  The bottom of the tankini does NOT come down to the hips as shown.  It rides up around the midriff.  I'm 4'11 and 96 pounds before anyone thinks that maybe I'm just big for a small size. I really wanted to be able to wear the striped bottoms and not one of my solid black bottoms for a change. The bottoms fit ok but not enough coverage - they hit right above pubic area, barely covering there... and I prefer half way to belly button. Also the top was tight in the shoulder straps,despite the fact that they are adjustable. The top fabric is just hanging and looks super blousy. It's a very inexpensive suit, so I modified the top by cutting the tankini fabric off all together. I have tried them on several times when getting ready for the pool or lake, and after about the 6th time of choosing a different suit I realize this suit does NOT work for me -  I wish I had just sent it back. I think this suit is great for someone with a moderate build who may have a bit of a baby belly they want to cover, that keeps them from being comfortable in a bikini. Or someone with athletic thin build who wants to wear something with coverage for beach volleyball, etc. It didn't work great for me, my best feature is waistline, which it covered, and it was just too blousy and looked weird."
3.0,Button hard to open and close... Returned
3.0,The cut was not flattering on me and it looks like it would be a great maternity shirt. Looks different on than expected. I gave it to my sister.
3.0,Nice shirt but it runs very small...
3.0,the only problem i found is that they are a bit too small. Otherwise the design is very nice.
3.0,Quality and stitching were a bit lacking. Unique style though.
3.0,Beautiful but I ordered a size larger and it is very snug plus the shorts in the picture a much longer than the shorts I received.  It will do as I'm losing weight but not as advertised.
3.0,"Pros: Cool pattern, sewn well, adjustable ear loops.<br />Cons: Huge!!!, pattern is not viable if worn properly, material sticks to dry skin like velcro."
3.0,"I love the idea of these pants but the pair I received is just too short.  The fabric, however, is delightfully lightweight without being clingy.  Had they been longer, they would have been a nice cool option for summer wear."
3.0,"The size I ordered is usually a little large, but since it had a full skirt I ordered it.  It is tight fitting across shoulders and upper arms"
3.0,"I like the hat over all and it fits well, but it needs some sort of string to help it stay on your head. My plan was to use to for a VBS and i am on the dance team, so i was unable to use it because it just fell right off when i moved."
3.0,"Estos tops son muy buenos  me encantaron pero tienen un detalle que las tiras se bajan a los hombros y no se quedan en su lugar tuve que hacerles un ajuste, cortar con las tijeras los de la espalda y hacerles un cruce más arriba y luego un nudo atrás, de otra manera no me acomodaban, no los volvería a comprar solo por ese detalle en lo personal!"
3.0,"Welp, I needed a new pair of slippers, and these looked really cute.  Too bad they RIPPED in less than a month."
3.0,"These are not the best fit for my glasses,  but i feel that is because they are a little too big.  When I am outside these are to far away from my glasses thay the sun glare is unbearable.  I think this is due to my particular glasses as these work better for my dad's.<br /><br />I use these to drive with and they work great for that."
3.0,"The picture makes this necklace look slightly better than it is, but if it looks like a cheap necklace that's because it is a cheap necklace and you get what you pay for. It is not super attractive up close, but wear it with the right top and it looks nice enough. It is not really shiny at all, just looks plastic. It looks ok on, nothing fancy."
3.0,same problem.
3.0,"Not comfortable, great construction"
3.0,"I am a size 9 and bought the 9/10 size and they were too small. I gave them 3 stars because they are really cozy, I just wish I would have ordered a size bigger."
3.0,I am a size 12-14 and ordered a XL and it was way too small. The material is alright but the price is a little high for it.
3.0,most were too big for me but were intended to be gifts anyway.  Not expecting them last really long but they are pretty for now and perfect for little gifts of thanks or something like that.  I paired mine with other slightly better quality anklets and I think they'll go over great.  Price really is a plus and they arrived so quickly.
3.0,Didn’t fit my daughter good!
3.0,Runs very small but the print quality is good.
3.0,"I ordered 2 of these umbrellas.  They seem nice and operate well.  However, 1 came with the cover and the other did not."
3.0,The band is difficult to latch on your on.
3.0,"devil horns are just hot glued on, they arrived broken af. i’ll have to fix them myself"
3.0,Small fit xxl
3.0,"It's warm and it's cute, but it's very cheaply made. The fuzz on the inside is constantly shedding all over my clothes."
3.0,"This was like the picture, but it was the wrong dress I wanted so I had to return it."
3.0,"Boots are very stiff, didn’t receive the ice cleats with them that I saw many other customers received, so that was pretty disappointing. Overall, boots seem like they will be very warm & hopefully hold up through the long winters here."
3.0,"Unless you are 5' or shorter, this is not a dress in any way. I am very tall (6'1&#34;) but I have a very short torso. This barely covers my butt. The quality is good and it looks nice but it is not nearly as long as I expected."
3.0,"BUT, FOR THE VOLUME OF THE PRODUCT I RECEIVED, IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CHEAPER IN COST.  IF THE COST COMES DOWN, AND IF I AM STILL IN NEED, I “MAY” PURCHASE ANOTHER GAITER.  IT ALL DEPENDS ON MY PERSONAL NEEDS AND THE CYCLE OF THE VIRUS!"
3.0,The XL is extra-large..... for a 4th grader.
3.0,"Went by the size chart and ordered a 2X. I'm typically a size 14, and while this dress fit I could  (and may) size down. Color is true to the photo. My only complaint is this dress is definitely not full length, not even close. This is a mid-length dress at best."
3.0,"This seller was great in communicating, etc. The jacket is well-made, but the fabric is a little polyester-y for me, less of a cotton knit and definitely not a French Terry. It's a cute jacket, runs pretty small and would be great on someone more on the lithe side."
3.0,Firs fine
3.0,"Absolutely no breathing room and zipper is on the left side.  Style is not bad, though."
3.0,"Great price, but you would think Fruit of the Loom could get pockets to at least match in size. Left side my hand can get into the pocket on the right side no chance, even my wife's little hand is snug."
3.0,This has already been returned on 1/13/2020 at the kohl’s in Gurnee  it was put in the bag with the other stuff I returned. I ordered 3 sets of 3 tank tops all were returned at the same time.
3.0,No me gusto porque está un poco sencilla. Yo necesito algo más grueso porque aquí donde vivo es muy frío. Viene un poco chica a mi niño no le quedo.
3.0,"Size- as the chart us ridiculous, I want to be specific. I am 5'7"" and 160 lbs give it take. My waist is 34, hip 41 and thigh is 20. I ordered a Medium.  I have room everywhere as you can see in the pics. They are not too loose or too tight. They do not bind or sag.<br /><br />Padding- if you ride sitting up and casually then the padding is probably fine. If you ride leaning forward then it is not great. The front padding to protect your lady parts is too thin."
3.0,"Good hat, but size ran a little bit large. But for the price, it's a good value."
3.0,Nice earrings. The earrings locking is not tight enough will fall out your ear easily if you hit against them mainly pulling mask off due to covid virus
3.0,frame a lot more pinkish than expected
3.0,Had a strong chemical spell but it washed out. I ordered up a seize and it was still small side
3.0,It is ok. Not a bright gold as I would assumed it would be. It much more toned down in real life.
3.0,Good quality but I was under the impression it would light up or glow of some sort. But it doesn't.
3.0,The watch ended up being much smaller than expected
3.0,"The handle comes off when opening the umbrella,  and its difficult to snap open sometimes,  like it is hard to keep it latched. Once latched,  and putting the handle back on,  it is great,  looks good,  works as expected,  closes on push of a button."
3.0,"This dress is beautiful, but it did not come with the tie around the waist. I had to find a totally different belt. Also, there are no ruffles in the back."
3.0,"If anyone remembers the 90's, this is a baby doll dress. It hugs right at the boobs and then below that it just hangs. It made me look pregnant. Definitely would be cute as a maternity dress though. Dress is that staticky material as well."
3.0,Not for a baby! They fit me! Lol
3.0,I feel like they are really thin but otherwise fine
3.0,"I love the way this bag looks! Sadly, I underestimated how much the placement of the handles would bug me. I have to wear it cross body style if I need to be able to get into the bag frequently. I do like the size though. It holds everything I need it to."
3.0,"I got the black and it was pretty.  Usually wear a 44"" chest top or XL.  Could not even get this one on.  It is for a junior size girl or only for a women sized up to medium.  Disappointed  to send it back as I liked it otherwise."
3.0,I can't wear panties or Bra with this dress (36dd top). I will be wearing it at the hotel that I'm staying on my vacation. The quality of the dress is nice though.
3.0,Its ok b not b bad
3.0,Item was described as true fit to size.  My normal size small in this item fits very snug.
3.0,Somehow I feel that the material is cheep and it shows but the style is cute.
3.0,"I ordered these in solid black.  They fit nicely and are a good length. Unfortunately, my undergarments could be seen when bending.  Definetley returning them."
3.0,Need to exchange from 32 to 34<br />Good quality
3.0,I love the style and the lenses are good.  They also fit well.  They are over priced though. They look very cheap.
3.0,Breezy flow. Lightweight. Doesn’t exactly sit like seen in the picture; the pleats allow the fabric to spread much wider than the pic shows.
3.0,"I am 5’ 125. DD chest. I ordered a large so even if the bottoms were too big that was fine. The bottoms actually fit like a small-medium which was great, but my chest was too much for the top. Its honestly a very cute bikini, well made and a great price at $9. So if you have a smaller chest grab it, in my case however maybe I’ll take out the pads or wear some nip covers or something."
3.0,"It’s very cute but I think the hood could be a deeper. My daughter’s head is average size but when she ties her hair back in a ponytail, her face and bangs get all wet. She has to wear a baseball cap underneath the poncho hood. Also, I wish it was a little bit longer. But the hood size was the biggest issue."
3.0,Quality of the manufacture could have been better. Overall they provided me a nice product that allows me to coordinate the tie with the look I’m going for.
3.0,It's short in the back. Thin but cute.
3.0,The shirt is too small and the pants are too big.
3.0,"Very small.....really for a child. Not as photographed.  Thin, lightweight."
3.0,I didn’t like the fact it came open easily
3.0,Colors are beautiful just too high waisted and smaller than expected.
3.0,It worked for the project I bought it for. It performed much better than screw devices.
3.0,"They seem to offer protection against cuts.<br />Not so sure about bruising though.<br />They are a bit tight and I think/hope they will stretch in time.<br />Biggest beef : they’re not very comfortable, a little rough textured for my skin."
3.0,"Shirt was a little smaller than expected and there were a lot of loose threads that I had to cut off, but it was of decent quality once cleaned up."
3.0,Band is a little big.
3.0,Algunos perdieron el color rápido
3.0,No Pockets
3.0,"This carb doesn’t work on all the Briggs engines it claims to work on. The choke plate hangs up on the breather elbow. Had to remove the choke plate for it to work, had backfiring problems after that, so didn’t use the carb at all and ordered different one."
3.0,"I replaced another order with this selection because the first dress in a large was a little too tight across the shoulders. I was super happy when I received this ensemble, but made the mistake of trying on the dress and not examining everything else properly. The night of the party I was disappointed to find one of the earrings in the bag was in pieces and the necklace was also broken. All I could do so close to the start of the party, was tie the necklace in a knot around my neck and rig the broken earring with another hoop from a pair I’d packed, which caused me to have two earrings in one ear. One of my earrings was also shorter than the other because of this. I just did the best I could because the party must go on and I was the host."
3.0,Cute but high
3.0,Shirt is cute but so hot to wear. The material doesn’t breathe. I wouldn’t buy it again.
3.0,"They fit fine, however I received &#34;heavy cotton&#34; shirts. Not &#34;SoftStyle&#34;. I have other Gildan &#34;SoftStyle&#34; shirts and the fabric is clearly not the same as those."
3.0,"The product is cute, durable, and perfect for little wrist. The flaw to this design is the clarity. The pictures are so fuzzy it’s hard to see them."
3.0,"I bought this mask because I am an avid World of Warcraft fan.  It works as any other mask would.  However, I was disappointed with the picture printed on it.  It is not as colorful as it is shown in the picture.  It is actually really dark and hard to see."
3.0,"Item is not cotton, is polyester. Not comfortable, This seller provides wrong information for the product, misleading customers to purchase. I requested return and refund. The amazon massage show up: you don’t need return, refund has been issued June 16, 2022. But I never received refund from my credit card more than 10 days."
3.0,To big on my wrist wore it as an anklet
3.0,So I bought these leggings because I was hoping to have something comparable to LuLaroe with out being so expensive. With that being said they are not worth buying if that's what you want. They are kind of soft like Lula but they are not as comfortable at all. The waist band is tight and digs in. Does not smooth anything out or help hide tummy area. They are decent. But I will not be buying again.
3.0,Barely able to be seen. The idea was lovely. The outcome isn't all that great. I'm very disappointed.
3.0,"The set is cute. The shorts fit, they’re pretty loose. The top however is the opposite; it’s tight in the arms and chest area. I’m about 196 and I bought the xl? I think and the bottoms are cute sleeping shorts. The top I’ll just have to set aside for now"
3.0,"Casio keeps dumbing their watches down.  This one works fine, but it lacks the multiple alarms, the dual time, and the countdown timer that i started buying Casio watches for.  Even without those, i would have rated this higher since Casio is pretty clear about this lacking all those features, but the watch band is a good inch shorter than the previous Casio watch that i owned.  Since there are no good replacement bands for these watches, i was stuck with the tiny watchband."
3.0,Wayyyyyyy smaller have order 2 sizes to 3 sizes up
3.0,I actually got these for my teenage son so he wouldn’t have to take his hands out of his gloves to use his phone. We both tried using our phones with the gloves on and they did not work. Disappointed to say the least.
3.0,The setting was not what I thought it was going to be.
3.0,"It is pretty, but not super well made. Very inexpensive so I'm not complaining."
3.0,These are a pretty good deal. I've been using them for over a year now and I still like them. A couple of the hoops got to warped to use with out it looking funky. A couple of gems fell off the studded ones. But you get what you pay for.
3.0,Lots of material. Pretty but looks like a mumu on.
3.0,order larger like suggested stil to small gave to my daughter
3.0,Not the same color. This is most definitely like an espresso brown. Not gold.
3.0,I purchased two of these dresses and one dress was way shorter than the other. I thought they would be good for the office however the one was just too short for that
3.0,A lot of fabric for a short person. Don't plan on lifting your arms without having to constantly adjust the off the shoulder sleeves.
3.0,this dress is not true to size.
3.0,"Pants are great, but they came in without the belt."
3.0,This sleepwear is too snug across the chest and pants are way too long.  I am losing some weight with cancer treatments so I'm keeping them for later.
3.0,"Good heel and arch support - helped my plantar fasciitis- got through a whole day of being on and off my feet with very little pain in my heel. However, the toe box is small and I'm having some pain in my big toes from that."
3.0,Way too small. I wear a medium pants and medium-large shirt.  I bought the PJs in large and it is way too small
3.0,These run narrow<br />I ordered xxl and they come European size which is narrower.<br />COVID pounds didnt help at all
3.0,Good but gets loose after a few wearings.
3.0,More of a pale olive green. Not even near neon as pictured. Was going to return but remembered it was $10 and not worth it to me to return just over the color. Though unlikely to wear it much since I prefer bright colors.
3.0,"Overall I'm very happy with the bracelet that I received. It's easy to put on, it doesn't fall off and it didn't get damaged when I was stuck outside in a storm.<br />The necklace that I received however I'm not happy with, it was way too small for my neck and it felt like it was choking me, so I would say it's more designed a child....and I personally think that I have an average sized neck.<br />I did receive this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback."
3.0,Tight but super cute
3.0,Super cute Simon belt. When it says 36 inches that is the entire length not waist size.
3.0,I found it somewhat small and sleeves were not 3/4 length on me
3.0,I was expecting the dress too but over all its a good costume.
3.0,"I always love purchasing from GemAvenue, although these earrings were smaller than described. I actually was looking for a larger pair. GemAvenue is a great company to purchase from!"
3.0,It's cute but it looks better in the picture than in the actual realm
3.0,"I like the soft material, but the. Shirt runs small."
3.0,I love this ring. It's runs small.
3.0,The product ended up braking but with a little glue I fixed it and now I wear it every day. One of my go to bracelets!
3.0,"The 42C bra fit is okay. The ribbing is a bit too stiff on sides and pokes. I'm hoping with consistent wear it will ease up. Currently can only wear for a few hours. The front closure is convenient, but the ribbons holding the clips tend to get off center and is uncomfortable."
3.0,"I like it, but it doesn’t last long.  It’s starting to unravel I had to super glue it and the Alohomora charm has fallen off. Luckily I found it so I can reconstruct this keychain"
3.0,Color and fabric are good bit the left side triangle was sewn wrong and has a weird bump that runs parallel to the ground. The right one lays flat against the thigh like the picture.  I will wear it at home but I would not wear out in public.
3.0,Fit is loose which doesn’t protect against virus. The softness of material is nice. But perhaps too soft that it feels like I’m being smothered when I talk with the mask on as it hugs into my mouth.
3.0,Tight fit not very comfortable. For the price you can do better.
3.0,Not as good as I thought it would be
3.0,its adorable my daughter is 7 and she wears the shirt more than the shirt she says its itchy but she loved it for her first day of school outfit
3.0,"Really nice, good quality, easy to adjust....unfortunately even at the smallest adjustment, significantly too large for my wrist.  It says it fits from 5&#34;-8&#34; wrists, and my wrist is 5&#34;, but this is more than a little too large, it is WAY too large, so much so that it's unwearable.  I'm very disappointed because this is exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,We had a little trouble with then being strong enough to stay on her esr. But over all they seemed nice.
3.0,"I really didn’t know how to rate it bc it’s made of quality and was pretty colors. However the fit was horrible on me. Not flattering at all. I am 145, 5’4, with a 36DD per visitor is secret. The bra was entireably to small but cut would have been flattering on a smaller person. I am thick in the middle and this did nothing for me. Felt it made me look larger."
3.0,"I ordered a size 16; I’m 5’6” tall and a little over 200 pounds. I wear a 38DDD bra. I feel like this would be a great fit for a woman with a very large breasts, perhaps even a nursing mom, as the top is it in a wrap style. Even with my large chest, there was a lot of room left up top. If I had gone down in size, it would’ve been too tight around my hips. I didn’t find it very flattering, but the print will probably hide a lot of imperfections. I returned the dress."
3.0,"Does the job!  Feels more like plastic than leather, however."
3.0,I was so excited to get these but was ultimately disappointed.  The post is thick and hurts my ear holes. It's flat and not round and hurts. The clasp has an issue a few weeks after purchase. Not sure I can fix it. They do look quite nice though.
3.0,"Great quality item, just runs small! My average sized 3 year old could not wear this. It was super tight all over!"
3.0,Material wasn't what was expected. Pockets were not fully done on one pair size was not uniform between the 3 pair
3.0,Not great quality fabric but works well for play with kids
3.0,"in the picture it looks black and white, in reality it is cream and white, the fabric is not bad. it is a blouse you really have to dress up for it to look good"
3.0,"My watch can't take my heart rate because it is too loose with this band. However it is cute. Wish it was about 1"" smaller."
3.0,"Good quality, color not accurate"
3.0,Low quality and it is too big. Looks nice though.
3.0,"Although this bra is comfortable and good looking, the clasp.is difficult to close: its mechanism is tiny and TIGHT.<br />Then, if opened, it becomes extremely difficult close it again!<br />If I use a seam ripper to remove this clasp, will have to replace it with the standard white bra extension piece that has 3 hooks and eyes on it.<br />(I don’t want to stretch the bra back lace by pulling the bra on and off daily.)<br />Replacing this clasp is going to take some time."
3.0,Eyes holes don’t line up well. There’s no hole for a pony tail. A little hard to breathe in. Otherwise they serve the purpose.
3.0,"Loved these for our faux locs. Fit snug around head, stayed on all night for myself and my girls (10yr and 6yr). Low stars because after one wash the bonnet opned at the seam near the headband. Simple sewing fix, but shouldn't have happened after one wash. Hand wash, or go reinforce the seam before washing. My bonnets from the dollar store hold up longer!"
3.0,"Very thin/sheer fabric. You must wear something underneath, 1 wear and the seam already split (right side bottom of the side seam)"
3.0,I generally buy a medium and ordered a 10 as it said that the material runs small.. But one size smaller would have been better.
3.0,"Definitely skimpier than I'd expected. Order a size up, unless you're really trying to show some skin in the chest area."
3.0,"I am 5'7"" and it was a little short for me."
3.0,The hat came wrinkled up in the package and small even though we went with the measurements posted. The cigar and suspenders were great.
3.0,Quality is good. Ordered a size small and the tag says size 9. The cape had CHOCOLATE STAINS on it. So infuriating
3.0,"Absolutely love these shorts! They’re so plush and the color is true to then pictures. The only downfall is the top. It’s a thin material, almost see through and fits more like a bra."
3.0,"Order for Halloween, should have ordered true size but I ordered to big and had to remake it to fit. Super cheaply made."
3.0,"When this jacket first arrived, I was in love!  The style was perfect for my January courthouse wedding, it was warm without bulk, and I got so many compliments on the style.  However, a few months later, the seams are falling apart.  I now have a rip down the inside back seam of the coat and it's just not holding up like you would expect an $80+ jacket to.  Plus, because of the outer fabric choice, it gets so dirty so easily.  It's almost like a felt material for reference.  Overall, for a special event or 2 it's not a bad jacket, just don't expect it to last you more than a few months."
3.0,Unfortunately it's pretty cheaply made.<br />The ribbon on the other side of the button snapped off as if it was a button as well...<br />So the glue was very weak.<br />Gonna have to find a glue gun or something to secure it back in :(<br /><br />This happened on my first wear so a little bummed...
3.0,Way too small for my son. Got thrown away.
3.0,Ordered for my 1 year old and they were too small- returning. Cute shoes though
3.0,"I bought this to go on a plane but they are too sheer for the airlines to allow. They are BEAUTIFUL! And if you are not using them for BS mask mandates, then they will work great for you! But they are so sheer that you can see through them easily and while they would help with cold air or just as a fashion item, they won't pass the mustard for the airlines. I do recommend for fashion and maybe work mask mandates (depending in the strictness of the employer) but not for Federal mask mandates."
3.0,"Definitely not the quality of the Barton silicone straps but sells for much less. It will fit me but is really too long for my 6 1/2"" wrist so will be a problem for even smaller wrists. Buckle is a cheapo. But might be ok for a cheap backup watch.  For your everyday watch, life is short, so spend more money and get the Barton Elite which also comes with an extra strap section for better fit options."
3.0,It was smaller than I expected but nice and seems good quality. Hope my wife likes it. So merry Christmas
3.0,Little tight but also I am 6'2
3.0,"Bought a white shirt from same seller and loved it. It was a Jersey material and flowy, and fit as expected (loose, but with slightly fitted look). Then ordered the black one and waited over 4 weeks for the item. Once the item arrived, I was highly disappointed that the material was completely different. It felt more stiff, scratchy, and see through. Still liked the cut of the shirt with the round hem, but saddened by the not so good material."
3.0,"This jacket is ok, but the elastic on the bottom is very tight. I wish there was a way to loosen it."
3.0,The were to big for my face but i still use them. Wish it was marital and not cotton.
3.0,"large on Top, if you have small size chest, this one is not  for us."
3.0,"The padding is too thin. The back was wrinkled  on me, ie too small and was stretching. MY FAULT, as I guess I ordered the wrong size.<br />BUT, my G-Granddaughter loves it!"
3.0,Too small for men shoes
3.0,Got XL to have a little room to move around and it doesn’t even fit!! Yes
3.0,The fit is good but the material is very thin and not like others I have purchased in the past.
3.0,"Really comfy, but shrinks alot when washing. I am average height at 5ft 6inches, and with shrinkage it is almost too short in the legs now after a handful of washings. I have another pair of these in a different syle, and I havent had the sam issues with that pair. That pair was also longer to begin with."
3.0,Es cómodo pero transparente
3.0,Items are very fun and modern
3.0,"The shirts are a nice quality, but they’re super snug. I normally wear a small in everything, but I don’t like my workout tops to cling to me so I ordered a medium. The medium fit like a small and clung to me revealing all muffin tops and bra lines pants lines and even my underwear line under my pants. I’m 5’2 and 120 pounds so I’m not exactly overweight. But this shirt  some how managed to enhance my gut. I should have gotten a large but I figure it’s good motivation to try to lose the gut."
3.0,I went by reviews and ordered larger.  They were way to big.  Sending back
3.0,"This product is somewhat okay, it looks a bit cheap when worn. But, that's expected I guess when I consider the price.<br /><br />It was too large, and the strings you use to tie it are flimsy. I was afraid they would snap. And if you tie them too tight, it tightens the skirt too much and it took a funny. I finally resorted to a belt over it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's pretty cute. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. I just wouldn't buy this one again. It's good for when I don't want to mess a real suede skirt up."
3.0,The gloves are thick and seem to be water resistant but they are not waterproof. The fingers worked only for the first month or so with my cell phone then stopped working so now I need to take them off to use my phone during cold weather.<br />I would recommend them to keep warm but not dry.
3.0,Fits snug. I bought a larger size for comfort and it fits more like an XL.
3.0,"""Glue dots"" provided are not sufficient. Will need to assemble with a glue gun if you want the sequin balls to stick. Otherwise good quality product."
3.0,Fits much smaller than the Decky fitted
3.0,It's lighter weight than I expected and Idon't like to dry clean.
3.0,"No compression at all, I ordered medium hoping they would be tighter and unfortunately while the black one fit me the way I like tank tops to fit, long and comfy, the grey one is NOT the same length and keeps pulling itself up over my stomach which is very upsetting...<br />I'll probably give away the grey one and if the blue doesnt fit I'll do the same with that.<br />Will be looking elsewhere for the compression I want."
3.0,"The frames are sturdy, attractive and nice quality. The lenses are attractively cut. Reading distance magnification is OK, but at computer screen distance, text is blurred, and too enlarged. Seems OK at far distance. Hoped I could wear these while doing computer work, but strains my eyes, and can't find a position on my nose where it works. So, just using for close reading. Disappointed, because otherwise they are very nice, and a great value."
3.0,Lighter color than expected and too small in the arms.
3.0,I bought 2 to help with inflatable dinosaur costume. It did help keep it inflated better for about 30 min. Costume started to deflate when 1 fan started making a terrible noise like the bearing was going out so it did not last very long.
3.0,"I really like the concept of these cropped leg warmers. The problem with these is the contrasting color stich that secures the button. It always comes loose and needs to be retied (and probably eventually removed). It would make more sense for this detail to be added in an elastic material. However, the rest of the design is nicely done and seems to be well constructed. The stay in place and do not loose shape in the wash and dry cycle.<br /><br />They add an interesting texture detail to outfits that include leggings and boots."
3.0,"The set was cute, but I have a few complaints. Although my daughter likes it, the tutu is stiff and the glitter gets everywhere. The leotard was smaller than expected. It just barely fit my petite 4 year old and it was supposed to be size 4-6. I wouldn't recommend ordering that size for anybody age 4-6, unless they are very small for their age and still wearing 2T or 3T clothing. My daughter wore it few of times, once for Halloween and a couple times just playing around the house, but she outgrew it before her ballet classes even started. Despite all that, it was fairly priced and my daughter liked it, and she still uses the tutu even though the leotard no longer fits."
3.0,The largest size might fit a size 14-16.
3.0,"We bought these as another pair of school shoes for a kid about six weeks ago. They seem to fit fine but they are wearing out incredibly rapidly. They are not his primary shoes, he only wears them to school, and they already look like they need to be replaced after just six weeks of light wear."
3.0,great if youre looking for something to wear in middle school swim class.........<br /><br />fit well buuuuuuuut<br />im returning it
3.0,Was searching all over for a solid black swimsuit for my daughter's swim meets.. It's a good fit on her body.. But the straps are extremely long so they dangle... No time to return or search for another one so I stitched it up
3.0,Love the suit but runs too small! Disappointed I could not wear it this summer
3.0,These were returned July 16th with the other pair of glasses that we returned. They were in the same container for protection
3.0,"I was looking for a wrap style dress and loved this brown color. It looks nice on, but I spent a long time ironing it and it was already pretty wrinkled by the time I walked out of the door. The material is really cheap. You get what you pay for."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:aeaefffce0350b96347db5ec6a214bf7]] Pros:cute, solid bottom for outdoor wear, the brand name<br />Cons: runs small/weird 7 fits like a 6.5 but 8 would probably be too big, cannot comfortably wear with socks, not cushioned and comfy like expected<br /><br />Overall I would not order these again unless they were on sale"
3.0,Bought two sizes.  One ended up longer but neither went around neatly enough to the front.  I am a women who wears size m to large
3.0,"Effective, not perfect jacket. All sizes are on the large size. The jacket is heavy, but loaded with protective armor. A decent 3 season jacket with lousy zippers."
3.0,I should have listened to the other reviews and gone up a half size. Even without socks they're too uncomfortably small to wear.
3.0,I thought I was getting 2 pairs.  Picture is deceiving. Sunglasses are great though and have a flexible width and are super comfortable.
3.0,My 36DD/34DDD boobs didn't fit into a medium. A large was a little too big everywhere else. 5'6&#34; 150 lbs.
3.0,I ordered a mens size US 10 and got a mens size US 9.  They came a day late and now I won't have time to order the right size before out Christmas party.  I had to give them to my boyfriend today to see if they would fit. They run a little bigger than normal so I was hoping they would fit. They are a little tight bit he doesn't want to send them back because he is hoping they will stretch side they are leather. Hope he's right.  They do look good so not totally unhappy.
3.0,I have a larger chest and the fabric gets stretched out really easily and has to be adjusted constantly. Decent crop top otherwise.
3.0,The dress was a good material but thicker than I wold have liked so I returned it.
3.0,"The fit was perfect, but they were not as described. Only one of the pair was fleece lined!!!!"
3.0,I was looking for something more stable so I gave it a 3. Otherwise its a good size and durable.
3.0,"Oh man, I was so liking this dress! But the second time I tried it on, I noticed that the white patches (on the black and white plaid dress) were see-through. Bummer. I was thinking the material was fairly thin and wouldn't be too hot, but no way am I going out in something transparent. Also it's polyester, so not very nice. The design is super cute though, and it fit true to size. Perhaps a darker version would work."
3.0,"The fit is not bad, but the sleeves are too wide, I am considering returning it. It would be a better fit on a man with muscle mass."
3.0,Slips around a lot and wasnt the easiest to slide cards in and out of
3.0,"Such a cute ring, but it isn't true to size :(  I got a size 8 and it is a bit to snug to wear, I need to twist and turn it to get it off.  I would say the 8 first like a 7 1/2 so I would maybe go a half size up when ordering.<br />I did figure out a trick though, I stretched it out a bit and now it fits much better!  Sits a little higher on my finger then I would like, but so worth it!<br />Some of my gems did fall off though :(  I kind of wish it was a little better made, since it is so cute!  I was given a coupon to purchase this product at a discount.  I was not paid to write this review and my reviews are always honest"
3.0,"It’s a cute and cozy sweatshirt. The fit was just a bit smaller than I expected, but still wearable, just not the way I intended to wear it. The pull strings for the hood are quite wide as well."
3.0,"The pendent is nice but the size is very small, you can fit the actual punisher pendent on nickel, it's that small, again, if you don't want something gaudy and looking like something a rapper would wear then you'll like this, if you're expecting something bigger then you'll be disappointed. I didn't want something gaudy but I expected something bigger."
3.0,Too large for my neck!
3.0,It runs kinda small . Didnt fit and my daughter bday is this weekend 🙄 but its a very cute dress
3.0,"Cute dress- definitely NOT a true wrap dress. Zips up the back and has two waist straps to tie in the front giving the illusion of a wrap dress. It also runs MEGA small. So order at least 1 size up. I’m 5;5, 145 pounds, and usually always wear a medium, the medium fit like a small. Is made of a stretchy, rayon material."
3.0,fit was really small.<br />uncomfortable.
3.0,Baggy in front. Not flattering to me anyway
3.0,will be returning it
3.0,"Material good, sewing quality fair, pants fit, top too small. Both 'marked' as the size I ordered, yet it seems one of them is NOT the stated size."
3.0,The chain and clasp are pretty.  The letters are very difficult to read.  Overall a nice product.
3.0,I wanted to wear this shirt casually but unless you button all the bottoms you can see the inside of the shirt which is white and looks cheap! It’s weird<br />I like the shirt and it fits good… a little on the big side… I would have gone a size down in retrospect
3.0,"cute but MUCH  smaller than I thought they would be.  The detail is hard to see since they are tiny.  Good quality though, very cute!"
3.0,I accidentally ordered the extra long band.  I tried to shorten it as per the instructions and found it impossible.  In fact I destroyed the band in the process.  My fault for ordering the XL but note that even a jeweler may not be able to size this puppy so you better order the right size!  Otherwise it is a good product.
3.0,Cute. Nice presentation
3.0,like the color and fabric but would prefer two larger interior divisions rather than the 3 smaller ones.  Would also like to have a strap/hook to attach my keys.
3.0,"I liked the look of the pant until we received them. They were supposed to be for the beach, he Might wear them around the house! They were too short and looked like pajama pants"
3.0,Was hoping the print pattern would be on both sides. Wish the description had indicated that before purchasing
3.0,"It’s real fleece line and warm but big waist and small but, thigh. I’m 5’3/130lbs. I usually wear M or 8-10. Ordered xl as review stated small. Waist keeps falling, but and legs are tight length is fine."
3.0,"Ok, wrong color!"
3.0,"The frames are very flat. I didn't like the way it looked. The arms of the glasses were metal, so you need to be very careful when you put them on so you don't pop your eye ball."
3.0,I am usually a small or extra small. This fit like a womens medium I would say. Thought it was worth a shot but if you are tiny it won't fit. Also very very thin material
3.0,I haven't bought this product but I gave bought a straight up black gator mask and a high quality headband. I'd say go with that before this<br /><br />.who knows maybe this mask kills carona
3.0,Small fits like a big medium.
3.0,"This hat is cute but the big big problem is that it is way too small. I have a very small head and I always have issues with hats being too big. After reading reviews I saw a bunch of people complimented the fact that it was for smaller heads. Well unless they were referring to a toddler head, I don't know how this would fit on an adult."
3.0,My initial impression of this item is that it is well made but not worth the price.  Strap appears to be very stiff and may require a substantial break in period.  There are cheaper alternatives out there that appear to be equally well made but are more comfortable right of the box.  When looping the strap through the buckle it almost seems as if the buckle is not wide enough to accommodate the width of the strap.  However the problem appears to be just the stiffness of the new strap.  On a more positive note the strap is very handsome and appears to be made of good quality leather.  I will probably wind up keeping the strap but my advice to other buyers would be to seriously consider cheaper alternatives as I think this item is overpriced.
3.0,They are cute .... but nothing crazy the quality seems pretty good. Not too crazy abt them
3.0,"Not a fan, this was super uncomfortable to wear. I'm a size 14 with DDD cup breasts and it was NOT flattering at all."
3.0,Some of the strands were broken and beads are everywhere. I cut the broken strands and its still wearable and a nice necklace for the price.
3.0,These are felt. Didn't see that in the description. Is using felt on your battery a good idea? Figured they would be plastic.
3.0,kind of heavy  more for winter weather
3.0,"I am 5'5&#34; and 115 lbs, 34A, and usually a perfect fit for most size 4 clothing. Ordered a Large.<br /><br />This suit is still too small in the torso. If you are 5&#34;4' or taller, even if you are thin, reconsider purchasing this suit, because it will not fit. It fits me fine in the bust, but the bust area also gets stretched clear down, so with the large foam cups in the bust, it appears that I have droopy breasts!!<br /><br />This suit would not fit a US size 6."
3.0,"Sizes are based on UK measurements,  not US measurements.  Way too small."
3.0,Love the cubes but could do without the envelope type containers.  The best part about the mesh is that you can see what's in the cube.  Out all bathing suits in one - shorts and tank tops in another.  Saves rummaging thru your suitcase.
3.0,"Very weird shape.  Not long enough  but way too baggy, in terms of width.  These are a very different shape than every other pair of Jordan shorts I've ever owned.  Thses are more like, old school shorts, as opposed to basketball shorts.  The look amazing, as far as the color and design though.  (and no, you can't tell that these are too short, by the photograph)."
3.0,did not hold up well
3.0,The floral print was pretty and the color was a nice vibrant red but the material of the dress was really thin and therefore felt a little cheap.
3.0,The mannequin used to display the earrings does not give an accurate idea of size.  They are beautiful but smaller than I expected.
3.0,"They are cute, but very cheap looking. I bought them when they were discounted, and definitely wouldn't spend $70 on them. I have normal sized calves, and they are VERY tight."
3.0,the top is good but the shorts arent very flattering
3.0,Dress looks really well on my wife the problem is once she went to take it off the shoulder straps broke
3.0,"I ORDERED MANY OF THESE, AND OTHER ONES WITH STRAPS, ALL AT THE SAME TIME. I RECEIVED A BLUE ONE WITH STRAPS FROM A SEPERATE ORDER, I RECEIVED THE BLACK AND WHITE, BUT NOT THE BLUE."
3.0,"A lot smaller than I pictured (I'm not sure how they came to those measurements, but it's small - about the size of a nickel). However the quality is good."
3.0,I am a size 9.5. And these were tight to begin with. I washed and air dryed and it still shrunk another size. Too expensive for this level of quality
3.0,I love it but the stones came off
3.0,"the sizes vary but also I am horridly allergic to these. More so than other jewelry. so painful,"
3.0,Ran small-returned it
3.0,Very soft. Quality. I am very disappointed that it ran so tight. I ordered  a large and it for like scallnn
3.0,"I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loves the concept. Since January though it's already tearing up. I'll end up buying him a nicer more expensive wallet sometime soon, but I can't complain too much. It's pretty cheap cost wise (oh, he carries a license, 2 credit cards, some cash, and insurance in it... So it's not the amt of stuff)"
3.0,"Only OK, probably wouldn't have purchased if I saw it in person"
3.0,Unfortunately too small.
3.0,I actually love this dress it’s so pretty but why I only gave it 3 stars is because it is very short when it should at least be sweeping the ground a little it is a few inches above my ankle and the black one I ordered is a silky like fabric which looks and feels better but the blue one is more of a cotton fabric.
3.0,"I love the color, but the dress doesn't have any stretch. I have a high waist so the dress is too short if I pull the waistline to where it should be. I'm five two."
3.0,"this mask is handsome and well made. My issue with it is that it is a single play fabric. I can't see that stopping viruses, but it would be fine for things like dust."
3.0,they were made well... just far too bulky for me...
3.0,Pretty dress but didn’t fit right<br />I had to return
3.0,"Love the idea of holding it in, but it’s too short in length"
3.0,Dress looks cute bought the large after looking at the sizing guide. Tried it on and it was snug. I like it but stitching is a little on the cheap size. I'm 5'4&#34; and it was pooling around my feet.
3.0,Ok nothing special
3.0,They were cheaply made and I was unhappy BUT...You get what you pay for! It doesn't hurt to go a dollar is more higher and get better quality.
3.0,Not that pretty . like in the picture
3.0,"Small.  loved the look.  loved the material.  great appearance, but too small."
3.0,"They are ok. Super flimsy, feel extremely cheap like they won't last long. Definitely overpriced."
3.0,"This jacket could be very nice, but you probably need to order 2 sizes up. It does fit my son, but it didn't fit me. There were some dirt stains on the side and on the arm, they were really small and should come out. The jacket is really nice and made well. This product came nicely packaged and it came in the time frame expected. I would recommend this product as long as you order big.<br />I did receive this product at a free or discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. The opinions are very much my own."
3.0,I liked that the fabric was thin and I liked the general idea of the cut of the shirt.  I had to triple check what size I had though. I wear a medium in everything and the arm holes came past the waist of the shorts I was wearing and the bottom of the shirt was longer than my shorts (not high waisted or short shorts). It would have been perfect if it weren't so massive on me.
3.0,This is such a cute hoodie but it’s very short :(
3.0,It's warm and fits well but is of itchy material and sleeves are short but overall happy with the look of it
3.0,... I'm 5'8nnot sure this is for full sized people.  I love the print and design
3.0,"came in extremely late<br />a few months actually.<br />i suggest not buying from this band if you aren't that patient. the item is nice though, they're not that big neither. which is okay"
3.0,"I was expecting the beanie to fit perfectly like in the picture show, turns out that it's bigger than it appears so if your wanting a beanie and your head is small i suggest something other than this."
3.0,It’s adorable. Cheaply made but a lovely fashion accessory
3.0,"Hello guys and ladies,<br />In a perfect world it would be nice to buy a waders just one time and fit perfect.  Please HELP THOSE OUT THERE and click on the THUMBS UP 👍  if this review helps. I'm a Filipino 5'7"" tall 165 lb I consider myself fitted medium Stout. My inseam is 29"" my shoe size is comfortable 9' .  The chart on these wader are a bit off.  I purchased these waders in medium thinking it should fit tight on me , not..... If you are a stocky person, height of 5'8""-6' SIZE medium would fit you well especially if your legs are long 32"" inseam . The neoprene footies are good size for 9 or pushing 10 half shoe and have a bit extra space for (wide feet ) . There are some problems I would find annoying ,like how low the belt line is . The belt line reaches just above my hip almost if I was wearing low-rise pants the rear belt strap is at the top of my butt crack🤣👎 in the back that's annoying😡!!!!!<br />I don't use that strap or it would feel very uncomfortable so I only use the belt strap through the side .  Great material I won't lie , front pocket is very LARGE , deep which is a big plus for me and a hand fit threw. Material inside warmer soft fleece you can throw a pack of hand warmers inside for extra heat on cold mornings. I cut a few inches off the shoulder straps so I can adjust to my comfort and remove the triangle plastic on the back strap . These waders seem to be made for people with long legs and big feet and low hips seems like with no butt sorry , not like I have a big one. Trust me when you get a pair and try it on don't say I tried to warn you here are some pictures that might help you. Thank you for spending time to read this review sorry so long enjoy your fishing and have a wonderful summer/winter.<br />PS. I RETURNED 2 PAIRS OF THESE UNFITTED WADERS BACK TO AMAZON RETURN STORES AND GOT THE GIFT CARD CREDIT TO MY ACCT LESS THAN 2 HRS THAT WAS SO CONVENIENT AND EASY."
3.0,They could be better. The gel support isn't very big so the comfort level I was hoping for really wasn't there.
3.0,"They get the job done in spin class, but order a size or two up if you can. I'm a size 8/10 and the XLs are snug."
3.0,"I'm 5'4&#34; tall and about 102 pounds. I figured a small would be too big but give it a shot. It was way too big. But even had it fit better I did not like were the waist line was I feel like it should've been higher it would've made the dress look better. The feel of the fabric was great, soft, comfortable and the color was beautiful (wine, maroon color). I moved my arm so you could see the arm hole size."
3.0,The leather is not as soft as I would like it. Took 3-4 wears to break the shoe in so it didn't hurt after a 6 hour day of walking around.
3.0,"Very cute, but, run very small.  The elastic also turned up in the front, not laying flat."
3.0,"Fits nice, super warm, but only have 3 stars since the side stitching was coming undone when I received it which makes me question the overall quality. I just mended it myself in the end though instead of sending back for the price."
3.0,The top is cute but I wouldn’t trust it to hold me if I was swimming through the waves. The bottoms squeeze my love handles in all the wrong places. It was cheap though so I’ll def wear the top to lounge
3.0,"The leather is good quality and aged well but unfortunately was too thin and stretched. The hardware has a nice brushed-look but it feels a bit flimsy. The buckle especially was a bit too loose for my liking and made the strap feel cheaper than it is. I initially bought this for a 22 mm watch but it eventually stretched enough to create a gap between the lugs. Now I use it on a 21 mm watch so not all is lost. In fact, as a strap for a 21 mm watch, I'd say it's not bad! It's good for dress applications where you need the watch to fit under the cuff since it's so thin, but it's not so durable for daily beater wear."
3.0,Funny as hell! But too hot and difficult to see
3.0,"Was purchased for my daughter who wears swim shorts and rash guard over top of her swimsuits at all times. Very see through especially when wet. It's a very cute suit, just wish it was lined better."
3.0,"It's beautiful, but fits snugly and I expected, by the picture, that it would be flowing from the bust area. Not so. Very disappointing."
3.0,For the people writing 1-star reviews: This does say 12 mm and they measure 12 mm.<br />They look good but the wire bends easily and DAMN they are hard to put on.
3.0,"The sleeves aren't tapered like they appear in the picture, so you end up with these enormous gaps as the cutouts move down your arm. The cutout straps also don't lay flat despite steaming and ironing. It's an inexpensive shirt so keep your expectations low."
3.0,Pretty but very thin material - can see through it so will have to be worn as a swimsuit cover
3.0,Disappointed when it arrived and the oranges don't match. If it is supposed to be worn as an entire outfit why would you not take the time to make sure you match the colors appropriately.
3.0,"they are ok. lenses are super dark, they'll be great for being out in the snow on a bright sunny day."
3.0,"I purchased this shirt in both the Med and Lrg as I am between sizes. My measurements are 37 x 29x 38.<br />The medium fit a smidge tight across my shoulders, but otherwise, I believe it fit better than the large. Sleeves are short, but I am only 5'1"", so they fit my arms to my wrist. The shirt didn't drape the way it did in the photo. Color was similar. Length was good for leggings.<br /><br />The large has a lot more fabric especially between the stomach and hip areas. Sleeves were a little looser, but the same length as the medium.  Fabric draped oddly as well. I believe this shirt would be more prone to wrinkles, regardless of size, because of the odd draping. There did not seem to be a noticeable increase in length for me between the medium size and large size.<br /><br />Fabric for both was soft and I believe it would have held up well enough in the washer, though I would have chosen to hang dry to be safe.<br /><br />I ended up returning both as I was underwhelmed by the fit and design."
3.0,"These pants are super soft and comfy. However, upon washing the elastic in the waistband gets twisted. I hate it when this happens! Otherwise, i really like the pants!"
3.0,Just what I expected left a good deal of room for shrinkage which I assume will occur.
3.0,Chest was super big!
3.0,Snagged very easy
3.0,"Good fit, very comfortable, but it’s not racerback as advertised. I have other outfits similar to the one I received."
3.0,Like look and quality seemed good. Problem was both the Medium and Large I ordered were too short. Seems like a sizing problem across the board on this item.
3.0,It looks very nice even real and it didn't fade but it broke out his finger (used as a fill in to new ring arrived)
3.0,I was hoping so but it came with no logo. The strap looks cheap though.
3.0,The hat is great. Good quality. Vibrant colors. Looks and feels good. The packaging is flat and small so it smashes the hat and puts kinks in the hat.
3.0,"Glasses are slightly larger than they appear in the ad. (I was looking for small frame). The screws have come loose at the nose piece multiple times and I've had to tighten them. Finally got tired of it and put a dab of gorilla glue over the screws. Not terrible for the price, but next time I might go ahead n spend a but more for sturdier quality."
3.0,"The overall style and design of the shirt are quite good and the fabric is soft and stretchy. I normally wear XS but the smallest size they sell is S. I'm 5'7"", 125 lbs, 34D and the small is huge. It's way too long in the body and the sleeves go over my hands. I recommend this product for people who are curvy or for those who are slender who like their clothes oversized."
3.0,The rubber nose pads have ridges so they can pinch the skin some.
3.0,looks good but didn't fit so i returned it.
3.0,I ordered these for a plus sized friend. I am a 12 and they fit me nicely. I usually wear a medium or large and prefer a soft fit instead of a very snug fit. The plus size fit me like a large in other brands. I like the fabric and would order more keeping the size in mind.
3.0,"I LOVE THIS HAT.  However, it is so large that it covers my eyes, and I don't have a small head. It is also very stiff; not soft and pliable at all like some I have had in the past.  I'm hoping that I can put something around the inside of the hat to keep it from sitting so low on my head"
3.0,"This bralette is cute, but the one size won't work for everybody and the padding is thick. I am 32 band and the fit was fine, almost too long, but the padding was too much for me and I didn't like the fit without the padding.  Had to return."
3.0,"The heart was tarnished, but for the price it is still an okay bracelet."
3.0,If you are fuller than a B cup it’s not flattering
3.0,"These socks are very cute, however, there were a few issues with the stitching on the top of them.  Besides the skewed stitching, these are my favorite socks for summer.  They are nice and thin."
3.0,"I bought these to block blue light when working on my computer in the evenings.  Sadly, they don't suit my purpose, as they distort the colours on the screen so much that I can't use them.  So if that's what you're looking for, I don't think any of the yellow light-blocking specs are going to work for you unless you're just working with black&white text.<br />However, the pros are:<br />- good size coverage for my small prescription reading glasses.<br />- Lenses don't get in the way of view or bump against your face.<br />- Clips attach firmly and unobtrusively to spec frames (though a bit stiff and fiddly to attach)"
3.0,"Looks great, but the spring is quite weak for my purposes.  Might be OK for currency only."
3.0,"Key does go all the way into the lock, and the bracelet is made for a small wrist. Would've liked to know the size of the bracelet for a better purchase. All together looks very nice"
3.0,"Made small, the fit is not as expected, looks short but is comfortable. I don't believe it is wroth the buy."
3.0,Super cute and felt well made just was not flattering on my body at all.
3.0,Cute but no flexibility. No elastic.
3.0,Nice product and design. However it did not function well. By function I mean the part where it goes on to the handle. It slide down and turned around so that it was not resting on top of luggage. Disappointed that it did not worked like pictured
3.0,"This was bought for my fiancé to wear while she gets ready on our wedding day. The material is nice and it is pretty. However, it is missing one of the inner ties and one loop on the outside. We ordered several of these for all of her bridesmaids and all of the other ones came perfectly. We may try to order her another one. It is still really pretty without those things but we want the product to be right."
3.0,This shirt runs much smaller than the others.
3.0,armholes small
3.0,This item did not fit because it runs very small.
3.0,The color wasn't as rich as I thought  I wished it had an inside button  but I'll keep.
3.0,"Not quite as pictured in my opinion the shirt has a loose fit and isn’t snug as pictured I went by size chart but perhaps I should have went down a size, overall it’s ok I can make it work"
3.0,"I bought a 2X per sizing info, but I am normally a US 14-16. It fits comfortably which is most important to me. Very soft, but the fabric is pretty thin.  It has been washed/dried a few times and no issues with that."
3.0,Very cute shirt but run smalls.
3.0,"My daughter and I have a few pairs of shoes that run narrow on us. Her more so, since she has a wider bridge. I thought this would be the bees' knees and solve our shoe issues. Well, not so much since it didn't fit down to the area we needed stretched. I uploaded some pictures to show that even before the stretcher was opened, I could not insert it to the toe area of the shoe. No matter which way I turned it. A water bottle works better for us and our needs. This is a really well made and quite ingenious device. It just didn't work for us. I would say know exactly what you need and then order. Also, try home hacks first like water bottles if you are the every person."
3.0,The fabric is a little stiffer than I would have imagined and the neckline is very wide. I was looking for something wider in the neck so than I could wear it under clothing and it not be visible but the neckline is so large than its nearly impossible to wear it any way but as an off the shoulder.
3.0,"Too big but very nice looking ring, if you can fit it. My husband is a size 11 and needed a 9 in this ring"
3.0,"I have always had husky ankles; I had seen them as muscular, but let's face it - they are just plane thick. Therein lies the problem - these socks are very tight on my ankles and calves. Downright uncomfortable."
3.0,"Does not sit on the hand gracefull.  The snake body is not flexible, and is as pictured.  I bought two, but the chain link on the wrist and around the finger are not identical lengths, and do not wear them on each hand as they don't sit evenly.  It's a good idea, just needs some refining.  Adjusting for a good fit is difficult."
3.0,"I probably should have ordered a size bigger as I like the style. Based on measurements provided here, I still would advise to buy a size bigger as the arm slots can be too tiny to the point of cutting off blood flow in your arms."
3.0,wanted to love these. they are cute and im gonna use them as sleep shorts.
3.0,"nice shirt, but as not much give to it, and for sure runs on the small side, sad to send back because it is a very nice shirt"
3.0,Their runs very small.
3.0,Zipper was not on track when received. I have to take it to a seamstress to fix it
3.0,My husband liked the when he saw them so we got rid of box. Later when he tried them he noticed the were a bit big but gave them a try. After a couple of days his feet were hurting because the arch support was not in the right place due to them being big. Do we had to keep them. He wears a 9.5 but these are at least a full size bigger
3.0,"I would not buy these sight unseen again, as the sizing is comically off.<br /><br />A small jacket is 24&#34; long, shoulder width is 18&#34; across the back, sleeve length is 18&#34;."
3.0,They don't fold flat at all. Could barely get back in the case that came with them after refolding. Are quite large also. Fit over glasses good but are larger than I expected
3.0,These are very cute and comfortable for my kid but they cracked and wore out fast.
3.0,The photo looks better than what you actually get. I don't know if I would call this rose gold it's more pink than anything which isn't going together as well as the other jewelry I wear (actual rose gold)
3.0,I like the design of the lenses but the frames are just way too light and thin. Very easy to bend and seem incredibly fragile. They unfortunately aren't the most comfortable either. These are just okay imo.
3.0,Should order a whole size up
3.0,"The jacket isn’t as soft as expected and it runs smaller than most size large jackets. I thought it was supposed to be fuzzy inside and out but it’s not. Not quite what I was expecting, overall review is it’s an ok purchase."
3.0,Great quality! Hubby wears a 38 used size chart runs very small.. Thought it came from china.. 😂 Will exchange for a 2x
3.0,"The 36 C was a bit small in the cups. Should have gotten a 36D. The color is pretty and the closure is secure. I will order another one, just in a different size."
3.0,The adjustable tape does not work.
3.0,They fit and they are what they advertise but they weren’t what I expected as a “cheater” or reading glasses.  Wouldn’t order again.  But that is just my eyes.  Someone else may have better luck .
3.0,"Bought this for my nephew's stocking, so I didn't expect high quality...and it wasn't...but he loved it anyway...he wore it all Christmas day."
3.0,"It's pretty heavy for backpacking. About 11 oz. I think it would be good for camping and other events, but if you're looking for ultralight weight backpacking gear, if you're the type of person who weighs your hiking bag, probably not."
3.0,"i'm a US size 6, I had to buy the XXL. They are really comfortable, i wear then around the house mostly and under some skirts/dresses.  because they are a thicker material with heavy seams, they are not good to wear under tighter fitting clothes (you'll see the outlines)"
3.0,Super cute out fit but abit bigger than I thought it would be. Fits more like 3-6 months
3.0,"I bought these to fill in the gaps of my knee high boots. While they work perfectly I am only giving 3 stars because the materials used seem cheap and plastic nylon-ish. Not well made, yet they do the trick as only the tops can be glimpsed when wearing boots.  If I was using them for dance/exercise and they were exposed, I'd make sure to get a nicer cotton/poly blend."
3.0,These gloves are good. I am replacing my older ones. It feels soft inside.<br />The touchsceen works but is not very smooth meaning you might need to try multiple times.<br />Also the wrap band w buttons are like my old ones. Two buttons same place. It seems these are all made by the same company!! So it does not fully grip my wrist and leaves a good amount of open space which causes some cold air to get in.<br />In terms of temperature I think 32F is ok but I did feel cold on my fingers when it got around 20s.
3.0,Nice fabric! It looks very classy. I got one size bigger following the recommendation.  It fits good I use it for work I sure look professional.
3.0,"I bought the size small. I'm 5'4&#34; and right around 115 lbs. I have a B cup chest and a small butt. I have a pretty average build and a lot of slim muscle because of yoga/pilates. This fit everywhere EXCEPT the arms. There was so much extra fabric in the arms, right under the armpit area and near the elbow. The sleeves were too long too. I was so disappointed because that ruins the silhouette. If you have a bit more muscle in your arms, this will likely fit you perfectly.<br /><br />The quality seems great for the price and I loved everything else besides the arms. Give it a try if you think the small would fit you!"
3.0,I thought this was sweatshirt material because that’s the way it was advertised but it was a slick type of fabric and didn’t have a fuzzy inside. It was smooth and not comfortable.
3.0,It was pretty. Lower quality than I expected. Also was definitely not the bigger size as it was too tight. I was able to still wear it but I'd prefer it to move around. I don't even wear my watch everyday and the band broke. I've had it for a few months but then all of the sudden one side of it broke off. I guess it's be better if you have a skinnier wrist lol
3.0,"I ordered this sweater, and I like it.  However, it is not as pictured.  It's more a 3/4 length sleeve, as opposed to the full sleeve pictured.  It's a bit tight in the arms."
3.0,It just doesn’t stay. It likes to slip and you have to keep tightening it fairly often if you are moving. It’s more just for looks. It doesn’t lock. ( purchased this for my old belt which is not a ratchet type. I didn’t know that’s what it was for.)
3.0,I ordered a top just like this in white and it fit perfectly. This gray one seemed to not have enough material to cover everything. The cross comes apart and shows your bra. It is also very short. It barely covers the bottom of my bra. The thickness of the material is nice though!
3.0,It was to loose for me but I did like it
3.0,The skirt was very long and a little thinner than what it looks like.
3.0,They are nice but not as pictured. Mine were patterned from a 48 star as opposed to a 50 star flag. I wasn't alive in 1959!
3.0,"I bought this band in May 2017 and at first really liked it. It's comfortable and reasonably attractive. The Fit2 goes into the band easily, and stays in securely unless solidly disturbed. It's also as simple to put on as the original band. So it works pretty well as a replacement band for the Fit2.<br /><br />The bad news is that after about 3 months whatever the coating keeping the metal pip from reacting with my skin wore off. I started getting red skin irritation right around the area where the metal touches my skin. I've worn all sorts of metal jewelry and watches with metal bands for many years with no reaction. My skin isn't particularly sensitive to metal, and I ignored similar reports in reviews when selecting this band. Yet I still ended up reacting to this band. I also noticed that the matte finish on the band wore off as well around this time and the band became shinier. So perhaps it's the material of the band itself that I'm reacting to. Not sure, but not too pleased wither way. For less than $10 it's not a huge loss, but I don't want to be replacing the bands four times a year."
3.0,"Not cinched on sides as pictured, just a vneck shirt. Still cute, but not what I was hoping for."
3.0,"The stretchy fabric is nice and they hug your hips well. Unfortunately I bought these because they are advertised as seamless and no panty line, and they give me major panty line!! There are are definitely prominent seams along the leg holes. The fit is too tight as well buy 1-2 sizes up."
3.0,"I like the hat. The only disappointment is that the “Pete” logo is ironed on, rather than embroidered. But it is cute hat, it fits."
3.0,"Beautiful pattern and colors. For an adult, they’re a bit tight. I had to loosen the strings and it’s still more snug than I would like. As they display here-they are not adjustable."
3.0,"Not super impressed, but they shipped in time for the cosplay event, and worked. Cheap material. cheap construction"
3.0,Nice wallet. If using the chain just be careful beads fall off. After using wallet for awhile button came off.
3.0,Still trying to make up mind about dress.
3.0,It is comfortable but runs smaller in the middle. I do like the length as well.
3.0,"For reference, I'm 5'8"", 220lbs, and use Torrid size 18. As the seller describes, these leggings have a generous sizing. I am in between XL and 1X. I ordered the 1X, and they are too big.  There is no tummy control going on for me. Additionally, I get that weird folding of the fabric over the crotch area when pants are too loose. So definitely size down, as the seller recommends.<br /><br />These are also very very short on me. They're a 28 inch inseam. I knew this before ordering, but I was hoping they would extend lower. They don't.  They look relatively nice if I roll them up and use them as capris.<br /><br />Lastly, let's talk pockets.  These have functional back pockets. The placement of the pockets could be improved, however. Right now, they sit low and to the sides- which gives it an appearance of a droopy butt. These pockets would benefit from being lifted and centered to give the appearance of a lifted butt. There are no front pockets. As a plus-sized woman,  I appreciate whenever leggings have front pockets, as it minimizes the appearance of the much hated lower abdominal fat.<br /><br />Lastly, price is another issue. While these leggings are very comfortable, I still don't understand the $45 price tag.<br /><br />Feedback to the seller: Please make these with a 30 inch inseam."
3.0,"It was  so nice  ,thank you 😊"
3.0,Granddaughter loves the softness but the white edge needs to be a little more fitting. Needs some elastic or tapering in the arms and legs.  But very soft and will fit for a couple of years.
3.0,"this dress fit very well around waist and chest but was very loose for me around the shoulders so that it kept dropping/being very loose around the chest.  I pinned it with bobby pins to make it stay up for the one night i wore it. I think it will fit much better once I make some adjustments to the straps, but doesn't not fit well on top as it is.  otherwise, a beautiful and comfortable dress."
3.0,"Price was great , quality was so so"
3.0,I love the style although it was a bit tight. I had to go up a size. I ordered this for my bff bachlorette party.
3.0,"I liked this key chain but after 1.5 years it started to fall apart.  Specifically, the hinge pins started to work their way out.  I fixed it once by hammering them back in and also tried to flare them out which worked for about 6 months and then the pins totally fell out and the keys were in my pocket.  Glad I didn't loose them.  If they can do something about the pins staying it, this would be a perfect long term item."
3.0,"This septum ring is gorgeous, but the clicker wasn't sturdy and fell out in a week."
3.0,I would have liked it to be bigger.
3.0,"If you are in between sizes go up, these are extremely tight everywhere...in the legs, thighs, butt, waist! They do the opposite of the ""tic toc"" leggings...I have a butt, with these, no butt at all, thehubd was NOT impressed."
3.0,"Nice enough pajamas, but get at least one size, maybe 2 sizes smaller. They are huge. I am short so the legs and arms are very long. Fortunately the cuff on the bottom of the legs keeps me from falling over the pants.  Soft, lightweight material. The neck opening is very large and the top barely stays on my shoulders. Because of that it's pretty chilly and I need to wear a robe over everything. Probably would be better if they fit."
3.0,"Pretty but, hard to screw together,  pieces are Not universal..  could be shinnyer"
3.0,Nice looking but the links are bigger then they look in the picture.
3.0,"Very cute top but not ment for some one with big boobs I am 160 and 5""0 in height my bra size is 38c and I typically wear a large there is no support in this top not even with a strapless bra"
3.0,No stretch with this fabric and fits a little tight
3.0,"I wanted to love this, as the minimalist style seemed like such a great idea. Unfortunately it is so minimalist it can only realistically accommodate a few cards, an ID, and maybe several folded bills. This results in quite a tight fit. The construction with the indentation in the bottom makes it easy enough to push the cards and bills out, but pushing out everything to select what you need gets old fast (and I'm not sure what to do if one of those bills results in many additional bills in change). I will use this when I really do need just a few things and space is at a premium or to store emergency cash or insurance cards in the glove compartment, but my life is just too complicated for this to be my every day solution. If yours is not, know that the leather and workmanship seem fine."
3.0,Amazingly beautiful but it stopped working after about a week even though I kept it wound.
3.0,"Item was a bit damaged, due to packaging. It was in only a plastic wrapper and placed in an Amazon box with other items, resulting in one of the brow tines breaking off. Overall it's a nice item."
3.0,"Quality is nice, but the elastic band (at the bottom) has worked its way loose on my black one, which is disappointing, but I put quite a few miles on it before the issue occurred. Still like them. 3.5 stars 😉"
3.0,Very nice fabric and like the pattern. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that they shrank 2-3&#34; in length. Laundered cold water and dryer setting of delicate. Go figure. Had really hoped these would be different and these are pricey. Maybe air dry??
3.0,I loved the color.  They felt so soft. I wish I knew it ran a size smaller!  So if you want these Pajamas order a size up.
3.0,"This is not stretchable but it's okay, very shiny and the heart adds another dimension of beauty and rarity to a standard anklet.  I have not given it to anyone yet.  I am saving it for another occasion, and it is a little better than two other anklets I ordered."
3.0,"While I love Chippewa's fit, quality, and style, the oxblood color is more red than a deep mahogany oxblood. These boots would be most appropriate at a suburban ska show in the 90s. Skankolicious!"
3.0,"they look nice but they hurting me, if i losen them they slip off if thight enough they hurt"
3.0,"35 days into having this, the battery won’t charge.<br />The battery flashed one LED for two days, on the third day all 4 were lit.<br />Maybe it’s charged, maybe not."
3.0,The product is well made and fits ok.  The item is priced low and I would give it a full star review except for one thing.  The pouch for a mans genitals is too small.  There is no lift like that of La Pasa Ergonomic U Cutting  underwear which I usually wear and which makes them very comfortable.<br />Other than that this is an ok pair of underwear.
3.0,I ordered size 2 but they send me size 1 with a sticker inside that says size 2. The shoes are very good quality but nos what I ordered.
3.0,Like the material but came somewhat small. I am a size 16 and bought an XL but found slightly small for the expected. Should have gotten an XXL to assure fit for the girls.
3.0,"Its alright. I mean for the price at least its not plastic, but I think I would have to pass on it if I found it again"
3.0,"She loved that and she is 5 so she is pretty rough with them. A few of them have broken, however with the amount of rings she just finds a new one. Thankfully they don’t shatter so no harm done."
3.0,It was not the same thing as the pictures it was different
3.0,Cup smaller
3.0,"Nicely tailored, length is great too. The color is more like a light coral red not deep red as pictured. The material is lightweight but has a flocked velvet texture to touch on outside (not shiny), backside of fabric is not flocked (smooth) and easy to move in... stitching is so so, zipper is plastic. Buttons dangle a bit but complete the look. Overall its ok for the price but could be better... A little disappointed that is why the 3 stars... Picture looks way nicer... Wish the red was darker..."
3.0,"The dress is NOT blue and gold, as it MAY appear on screen, and what I tbought it eas. Its blue and pink. Not bad but not what I expected. I dont know about the fit, it was to be gifted. I'll let her keep it since she's already seen it, but we are looking for something else."
3.0,is good. 3 star
3.0,Band seemed a bit cheap
3.0,length is ok but the width is way too wide. Had to give it away.
3.0,like the shirt what it stands for and everything just wish it was made in America and the print was a bit darker this is a lot of money for made off shores
3.0,"This necklace is so pretty and not very heavy considering the design. All in all a nice addition, but if took FOREVER to arrive and the expected delivery date kept changing. Order months in advance or you risk not getting it on time."
3.0,I like this swimsuit. It is cute and gives better coverage than most. The only trouble I had with the top was the exposed elastic under the built in bra. Since it is not covered with fabric I had an allergic reaction and developed a rash everywhere the elastic touched me. I don't care for the shorts though. The shorts are only lined on one half and have an uncomfortable seam right through the center.
3.0,"I like my dress, the only thing is that the dress description says grey. The color is more of a bluish grey. It is not like the photos. I will try to post a picture."
3.0,"This sports bra is ok - it provides reasonable support for low impact activities. I am not sold on the fabric, though. It does not breath well, and it feels synthetic. I wear it, but it is one of the last ones I pull out of the drawer - which is a great reminder that I need to do some laundry."
3.0,it need to be a tad bit wider around nose and the rubber keeps coming off hard to put back together
3.0,Didn’t last long but long enough for the price for what we needed to use it for my kids party
3.0,"Super cute and great material! But if you are a tall girl, this dress is not for you. I am 5'11, 145 lbs. I ordered the large because I was concerned about the length and it was still too short."
3.0,Its bigger and feels way too heavy for hot summer weather.Wont be buying any more. Not what I was expecting .
3.0,Order very large size but runs wag too small
3.0,Was ok size and then I washed them and lost a half size....
3.0,Don't like how it changes colors
3.0,The lecklace was ok but the shipping destroyed to necklack
3.0,Not as tight a weave as I expected
3.0,"I am on the fence about my feelings for these sunglasses. They don’t cost much, but they also feel very lightweight and they are a loose fit."
3.0,"Totally inaccurate sizing.  I am size small in tops and size 4 in pants.  I ordered a medium after having read the other reviews.  I received my medium coat and the sleeves are extremely short, it is very snug around the armpits and back - so tight I do not want to put my arms out or the jacket will tear in the back.  The material is not as neatly pressed as shown in the picture.  It is made of a very soft fleece material which I do not mind but if you are looking for winter protection, this coat is not it. Will be practical for fall weather only. The style is super cute and sewn and stitched very well! Definitely not cheaply made. If only it fit appropriately.  I still love it regardless, but do encourage you order TWO sizes up."
3.0,"Bought these for my 5 year old. Maybe he has a larger than average head, but they were way too small for him. Just be aware that these are for a VERY SMALL child."
3.0,My daughter actually wanted to get these for my son's birthday. Super cute and he loves them...but the stitching is messed up here and there on them. I just have him wear them around the house.
3.0,I was disappointed in the colors…pastel and bright colors rather than fall colors shown
3.0,"This dress has great body and is a beautifully rich deep navy color.<br />The dress is super cute in the photo,  and the details at the bottom are wonderful in person.<br />Unfortunately, the seams going down the front of the dress show too prominently for me.<br />Maybe paired with a blazer or cropped sweated could detract form that look.<br />Cost too much to have that look."
3.0,I normally wear a large and ordered an xl to be safe and it's tight for an xl.
3.0,way too big (wide) great shape otherwise
3.0,The material is very stiff with a plastic feel. Fit was smaller than expected
3.0,Both of the crystals fell off the first day we wore them.
3.0,Quality is ok but sizing doesn't quite match size chart. Order 1 size larger
3.0,"I read the reviews and sized up one size. This runs very small. I'd suggest sizing up 2 sizes. Otherwise, very cute and classy looking, especially for the price."
3.0,Length is very short and fabric is see-through - returned for these reasons.
3.0,"If you have any amount of inner thigh chub, at all, these will roll down. I got them on fine, but the moment I stood up, they rolled more than halfway down, despite the silicone on the band. Sadly, returning."
3.0,Very nice blouse but too big. Buy at least one size smaller.
3.0,"This is absolutely adorable! The material is soft and is in great condition. The only down side is that this was way to large for my babe. I bought 6-9m and it looks possibly 2t. My babe is 16lbs so I was hoping the 6-9m would be close to her size, but looks like this one runs really large."
3.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet and I love that it's easy to get on and off.  The stones are very colorful.  However, so far, there have been at least 4 stones that have broken free from the wire - and those are the ones I'm aware of.  The jury is still out for a bit longer to determine if I will return or not."
3.0,I love it. Just runs bigger than I expected.
3.0,I dont prefer light cushion.  picture shows elite ultra light
3.0,"These are good headbands.  They are thick, absorbent, and comfortable.  After washing, they have an unpleasant odor, but I am hoping that it dissipates over time.  The odor is not so strong that I cannot use the headbands again."
3.0,Cute but not knit. It’s a poly blend jersey type material. I am usually a Large and purchased a 2XL to get the fit I want.
3.0,"They are ok, not what i expected."
3.0,"Just didn't know that the manufacturer and seller idea of spandex and polyester is a velvet looking material that can only be worn during​ winter. Had I know that, I wouldn't have ordered it. I was only looking​ for spring and summer attires.  That's why I'm only giving it three stars and it was no way worth $25. The three stars, too, is a realization to NEVER EVER spend that much, again, for these cheesy type clothings from these manufacturers. Sorry, just not worth my money and the headache of returning it, either."
3.0,It's a cute dress but I am returning it as it doesn't look that good on me.
3.0,"I was both happy and unhappy with these gloves.  I'll start by saying that for the price, the quality is excellent.  They feel great, look great, and come in a sweet little bag for storage.  I was unhappy, however, because the sizing just isn't right. I made sure to check my glove size before purchasing, and based on how you measure your glove size, I was exactly an 8.  So I bought an 8.  Trouble is, while the palm of the glove and the four fingers fit well, the thumb sleeve was far too small.  I have shorter, stubbier hands than perhaps the average male, and that showed bright as day with the gloves. It would have done me no good to change the size, because it was clear that for a perfect fit, I'd need the thumb area of a size 9, with the palm of a size 8, and fingers of a size 7.  Obviously this isn't possible.  What I'm trying to say is, these aren't tailored very well unless you have longer, more slender fingers.<br /><br />I considered returning the gloves, but I liked everything else about them so much that I opted to just cut off the thumbs.  For the price, they are excellent.  Just be prepared for them to not fit correctly if your hands aren'r perfectly average in size and length."
3.0,"A bit disappointed it did not include instructions.  Bought the pearl.  It does look nice, but be careful when opening the package.  Two very tiny hooks are enclosed & I did not see them.  Now, I have to make something to replace the ones I accidently threw away"
3.0,"These are cute tops, but they just didn’t fit me well. I’m a 34D and I even bought different sizes, but both didn’t look good with my bust. And it doesn’t even matter the bigger size I bought just made it more flowy, but the tightness at the bust was too tight either way. If you have smaller boobs, it will look nice, like how it looks on the model. But, if you have a bigger bust, don’t bother and waste time with this lol."
3.0,"My cup size is 34 C.  The C cup size runs small although the 34 inches around the body is fine.  Bra is a bit itchy.  This bra is nice for halter tops and other dresses that are closer to the neck.  This bra stays in place.  I'll wear it when I go out, but not for comfort."
3.0,"I really like how it looks and feels, but it was too big on my arms. So, I have to send it back."
3.0,The bag is exactly how it looks on the photos but the strings are cheap and were not tied??
3.0,Cute prints but very poor fit. No nose fitting wire.
3.0,Too small and sleeves are very short
3.0,"It's a meh quality blouse, feels cheap."
3.0,"Purchased for daughter. She loves it but it seems very cheaply made. It Will not last, great for a one-time costume and that worked for her."
3.0,"Runs very big, sweatshirt seems to be bigger than the shirt. The zipper busted off of mine and the sweatshirt cored frayed, very unhappy with the purchase. Already returned it for being huge and the next size just was destroyed. Had to buy a new one from another company and I’m stuck with this."
3.0,"I was really sad to have to return this. See, the dress is really cute and all, but the zipper on the side was faulty and, in the middle of Walgreens, popped open. Everyone got a nice view of side boob. I realized I could unzip and rezip and that fixed it. But then it kept happening. Constantly. Multiple times in a day. Not worth the hassle, so I did return it! I should add, the zipper wasn’t popping because the dress was tight, it wasn’t. It fit perfect fine. The zipper was just cheap."
3.0,"The fabric is ok, it's not something I would buy again. I really don't like the sewn sides, they make me look huge!"
3.0,"Very cute, but doesn't stay on."
3.0,Could of gotten as good a one at Walmart. Weak frame.
3.0,"My mistake, these are not as sturdy as another set I have"
3.0,Came with a hole in the side of it. Runs a little small.
3.0,I ordered my usual size small. For reference I am 5'3. 125lbs.  There was way to much material and was way to baggy and long. It might be ok if you plan on wearing it with leggings. Print and material was nice but had to return it.
3.0,"Scarf so soft and very easy to drape, love them both. Unfortunately every time I wear them, the fringe unravels and I have to trim the pieces of yarn.  When wearing the scarves, I am very careful when draping them, but sadly the tri-color scarf has stretched to triple it's size."
3.0,Aesthetically pleasing design. Convinient. Fits an 11&#34; computer just fine. Serves its purpose. Nothing amazing though. Maybe not worth the 15$ i payed for<br />It.
3.0,"They are really comfortable, but part of them are too big and its kind of uncomfortable when I sit on it. Other than that it is awesome. (From my 9 year old)"
3.0,"The color was a pretty color and design, but the material was papa thin like a thin night gown. I wear a size 8 in misses dresses and pants, I ordered a medium. The dress itself fit fine however, the sleeves were way to tight. If I ordered a large the dress would fit too large. So I returned the dress."
3.0,"I had order in S but it was small, i also order in M and its ok."
3.0,"I would have given 5 star, but at first I try it, some parts of the dress ripped off, it came also without some Botton, so have to sew the dress and bottom. Besides that I ordered M and it's lit big in the waist, I think Small would also fit me cuz I'm not busty. I'm 34 b, 168 lbs, 5'5."
3.0,Really cute but I ordered the size recommended by the size chart and it was too big.
3.0,"I'm 6""4. 240 the coat is Nice but I ordered a 2XL..it was too Small I definitely suggest you order a 3XL."
3.0,looks good but smells bad. I get plastic smell when keep it in the car.
3.0,Nice clean design. Look good. Ordered September 1st. Not delivered until September 16th. Not pleased with the Prime delivery.
3.0,It's an okay product. The material is really soft. Stretched out pretty quick though.
3.0,"My daughter, who can only wear gold earrings due to sensitive ears, loved these when she first got them.  However, one of the earrings snapped in half after about a month of wear."
3.0,The s shirt could be longer.
3.0,Zipper broke after one day use.
3.0,"Last year I bought a size 5-6 and they fit perfect on my son’s feet. Such a good buy since we would go from the splash park directly to the playground without changing shoes.<br /><br />This year I bought a size 6.5-7.5 since he out grew the ones from last year. We recvd it and they looked tight on his feet. So I put both last year’s size 5-6 up against this year’s 6.5-7.5 and they measured exactly the same. I am returning the new pair. As much as I just want to trade the shoes for a bigger one, I’m afraid of getting the wrong size again.<br /><br />But as far as quality goes for the original pair we bought last year. They held up pretty well for my son."
3.0,"I bought the XL because I put all my weight on in my gut and have a 33” waist. It fit on the waist and I could have overlooked it being a tad lose on the bust, but I was swimming in the sleeves. They were far too baggy and brought the whole look down.<br /><br />That being said, it was a lovely dress. I liked the material and style and I really really wanted to like the dress as a whole, but the sleeves were a deal breaker. If I were more proportional it might have worked better."
3.0,"The pearls are very nice. My wife was happy and that was all that matter to me, but the clasps are to thin and weak. So now I have to take it to the jewlers to get a new one put on...Would not buy again."
3.0,Pretty much the same shade and resolution as the original Oakley lense.  Can't really tell the difference even though they are supposed to be polarized
3.0,Too big for an adult.
3.0,"Disappointed.  I love the overall ring design and it was the perfect size.  My disappointment was the stone.  The ring is beautiful, but the stone is very lackluster.  It's dull and cloudy and cheapens the overall appearance of the ring.  There's no sparkle or shine whatsoever in the stone."
3.0,Its a good jacket but still too small even getting it a few size bigger
3.0,"Look good, feel well made. Only problem for me is the arms are not long enough, making it uncomfortable on my ears. Not for all large heads."
3.0,Did not like the dress it was too short
3.0,that as thick as it looks but its ok
3.0,We got a size 10 for a 9 year old but the shirts are smaller than I thought they be. Great colors tho
3.0,"Super cheap material is not the most comfortable, but it's not bad. Price was cheap, so was expected. It's cute on. I like it. I wear an XL in most tops and this fit fine."
3.0,"Liked colors and style, but won't accept unmatched stripes"
3.0,Looks a little cheap. But it is nice none the less
3.0,I  bought these for my mother but she can't wear them because the top of the sock is just too tight. Very uncomfortable for her.
3.0,Should have ordered a size or two smaller
3.0,"A little small and short. I'm 5'9"" and 180 it's not tight but it rides up...if you know what I mean. The length also hits me right above my calf. It's a bit awkward. Maybe if I loose a few it'll fit better"
3.0,its falling apart already.
3.0,the sleeves are as photo and so is the center off the shoulder folding piece. the shirt minus sleeves is mesh and not cotton as displayed.
3.0,I recieved many compliments and I love the design. The material wrinkle resistant and lightweight.
3.0,This dress was beautiful but the bottom fit and the top was extremely stretched out and didn't even remotely fit.
3.0,"not sure I like them, thought they were more like a henley shirt, not so full but love the designs on them"
3.0,"I’ve purchased these frames twice. Lost the first pair, ordered another because I like the subtle gold Versace logo on the frames. These are pretty stylish.<br /><br />This 2nd pair hasn’t lasted me even 2 years. I noticed one of the arms had a lot of vertical movement. Upon taking it apart I discovered one of the tiny gaskets that seals the arm hinge to the frames was gone. Not a big deal when you’re wearing them, but now they feel super cheap. Won’t be purchasing a 3rd pair and will keep these as a backup."
3.0,conection was loose so it hangs a little crooked.  not bad and I can live with it
3.0,"Cute, but sizing is WAY off!  These are HUGE!  Ordered my 7.5 year old size 8 (which he has in other clothes) & this size 8 looked nearly large enough for a small adult!"
3.0,The shirt was comfortable to wear and a bit thin but it runs small. I always buy XL size but this one comes a bit smaller than I expected. But overall it was nice.
3.0,"These seemed like child-sized gloves, but I made them work for a short period of time."
3.0,Too small for my 4yr old. I wish people left comments about sizing. Not just this item but throughout Amazon. I could care less if you like it.<br />My daughter is 4 almost 5. She’s 43 pounds. She’s bigger/taller than the average petite 4yr old.<br />I bought the 4/5 - no good. she’d rip the back when going down. No stretch at all! I would have needed the 5-6.<br />Not best quality- but it was literally for a one time use.
3.0,The hair piece is thin. Looks thick in the pic but its not
3.0,Not really protective at all
3.0,These glove are a great length for weeds but the stickers go right through them. I liked the description that stated they have leather on the hand part but it doesn’t help with stickers. It just has a little on the palm.
3.0,Nice design and fabric is forgiving. I felt like the sizing was a little small. I usually wear a large and an xl was a little too snug for my liking.
3.0,"Soft & warm, but it's too large for my head, with no way to make it smaller with the strap."
3.0,Seems well made but I ordered a size larger than usual and it was still small
3.0,Cute little accessory
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34;, 118lbs and usually wear a medium because I like the baggy look. The model in the photos for this product must easily be wearing a Large. Although this Medium is still very flow-y, I probably would have gotten the look the model is portraying with a Large. Also, this isn't the same shirt as what the photo description and you can tell by the difference in its ruching and the V on the two shirts. The V on my shirt is maybe an inch deep? The V in the model's shirt has to be at least 4 inches. This is why I'm docking it a star. I docked another star because it had some small brown stains on a sleeve when I reviewed it lol. But they're so tiny and not noticeable that I don't really care."
3.0,Cute but a little too small
3.0,Nice but the spring ring clasp is not good. Sometimes it doesn't close and I have to force it to close. Hard to get on. I fumble with this when I put it on. A lobster claw clasp would be better.
3.0,"this is my 2nd one purchased. the first one lasted about 10 months before pieces broke away.<br />the 2nd one is nice in appearance with improvements, but the sides are slippery where it is supposed to grab to not let your phone slip out of your hand...ugh"
3.0,The luster of these earrings faded very quickly and look almost copper a year later
3.0,"This necklace is beautiful, but tiny. It came knotted in a little plastic bag; the pink bag was in the box separately. I very carefully detangled the chain. The chain itself is very thin and I imagine that it will break at the smallest snag. I love the necklace. I just wish that the pendant was bigger and the chain thicker."
3.0,"I like it. I was hoping for the fabric to look less cheap, but for what I paid for it it is very nice. It did have terrible smell when I got it though and I had to wash it. That did not help much so I sprayed it with perfume. I've been wearing it for a week now and I can't smell it anymore."
3.0,I ordered my size was disappointed when they didn't fit. I figured they would be good but they won't even fit my wife
3.0,A beautiful piece but too heavy for my fine hair
3.0,Not durable at all.
3.0,"These pants are great for hot weather. I use them for fishing and casual activities. They are very lightweight.<br />I am 5'10, 325lb and usually wear a 28 or 29 length. I ordered 5x(would normally wear 3x) and they were a bit tight in the thighs and 7 inches too long.<br />Luckily the pants break in and after a few hours they are actually very comfortable. The tightness relaxes but the length had to be hemmed. I bought 3 pair and all 3 fit the same so they have decent quality control. Wish they had cargo pockets but pants like these are hard to find for big boys so the fact that I have to hem them is not going to make me destroy the rating. I do wish they'd size these things more accurately. They're obviously using the size standards of whatever country they're made in when they should be using American sizing if they want to generate good ratings with American customers. lastly, DO NOT MACHINE DRY THESE UNLESS YOU WANT THEM TO SHRINK A LOT! Machine wash, air dry and they fit just like when you took them off last. I will be buying a few more pairs."
3.0,"Great lenses, shape and overall design. Much lighter and “cheap” feeling than I had hoped. The plastic frames cracked after only a few times wearing."
3.0,"Cute but too big , ordered a 0-3 month but fits like a 3-6 month outfit"
3.0,It’s a cute bracelet and they say a lot of good things about it but why do they call it a pink quartz because there is no pink on it
3.0,Nice farmworkers or keep cool too
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:d7837d2665b255f6ae520b53cda8cc64]] I like that it is made of leather and the money pouch is hidden and the zipper is okay quality. But, the leather don’t feel or look real. I question the durability of the belt. The money pouch won’t hold much in currency. Aside from emergency cash, it is simply a novelty item. It do not represent good value because of the price. I give it a 3 star rating."
3.0,"Nice top but slight bigger than I thought. Overall, its a good buy."
3.0,Runs small  Nice festive summer top
3.0,"I got these for my wife.  These are okay if you don't mind the fabric.  It is more like a synthetic water-wicking type fabric.  Soft, but not breathable.  If you have a long torso, these don't fit great- like they don't go up high enough in the waist."
3.0,It's a cute bag.just poorly made.
3.0,I ordered this bathing suite for my mom who is a bit curvy and very well endowed I ended up sending it back because the straps were too thin and stretchy toffee any real support for her.but it was cute maybe for someone smaller in the chest area. I also ordered her a xxxl she is between a 12&14 U.S. It was a. Little bit long but not sure if by design to create a roughing affect in the tummy but width wise it seemed to fit.
3.0,"Only 3 stars because I made sure to follow setup instructions and somehow the battery life only lasts an hour, if that. The shoes are comfortable and my son enjoys them, but we were disappointed with how often they require charging."
3.0,"This necklace has a gold coating on the back, which either blocks light or adjusts it.<br />I would say this is a nice gift for an adolescent girl, but if you're looking for a woman perhaps spend more for a better quality."
3.0,it looks much better in the photo then it does in person!
3.0,"I really like the hats but not happy about the colors. I got 3 black, 1 dark gray, 1 light gray and 1 navy blue. No red, no olive, no royal blue. Also the navy practically looks black."
3.0,Washed twice and the neck line is coming apart😑
3.0,Size is fitting bigger than expected
3.0,This jacket would have been nice if it had fit according to size information.  Too tight around the chest and middle to wear.  Hunting someone smaller to give it to.
3.0,"Too tight. Spider design not centered.  Fortunately I have a friend who can really sew and was able to take it apart and turn it into a much better, much more comfortable dress."
3.0,"Ok so I had two issues with this product, upon opening the package i was excited as first but my first time wearing it I discovered that there was a hole in the left pocket which Throw me right off throw me right of then the size chart was off I am a medium fit and so I purchase that but it fitted tight around the chest area.. I contacted amazon about the issue and no resolution so it’s a one star for me mainly because of the service a customer like to know that there business is important I didn’t feel like. The quality of the product itself is good tho I must say that."
3.0,the glasses arnt to bad for being so low price there really clear and can pretty much be worn at night. i like them and wear them all the time
3.0,Wasn’t impressed with the picture on it. It didn’t look 3D
3.0,Nice fabric and style
3.0,These don't fit correctly in any blazer pocket I've tried them in
3.0,These are ok.  Pendant is cute.  Gold one is very cheap looking.  Chains are cheap looking as well.
3.0,"Love the look, very different,  but was small around  the arms. Order a large, should of got a extra large"
3.0,Looks good but not easy to size. Plus it came wirh a bit of color issue on the buckle which is fine. I took it to jewelry shop so they can size it and they made it as small as it goes still not good while the size I got was supposed to go down to 6 inches.
3.0,Material is very thin. Get the next size up to make sure they fit and don't split at the seams. I received them very fast and for the price they are good.
3.0,I LOVE EM!!! I have small wrists but not small enough to wear  kids ones lol 50 pcs go halfway up my arm only down side is when I put them on my hands and arm turned yellow from the dye? -2 stars for this reason
3.0,I returned the first one I got because the seems we're not sewn together correctly around the neck.<br />Today I got the replacement and it has the exact same problem!<br />Very frustrating because I really like the top however the mismatched seem is a glaring problem!
3.0,Not sure yet.
3.0,Very sheet material and material that wrinkles easy. It is cute but not what I was looking for. The cut was very flattering but too sheer and  didn't  want to have the wear a slip underneath.
3.0,"Very comfortable, good for around the house. Not great quality. The fabric didn’t really line up correctly so there’s a fold on one of them at the ankle. Extra strings not trimmed. Despite rubber sole, not good if you need to go outside for a minute. Fine for what they are but obviously lower quality than some other brands."
3.0,Size was was off. Returned.
3.0,I really had high hopes for this dress because its just so beautiful. But it came with a bunch of loose thread everywhere. I bought this for my niece for her 1st birthday but she's not here yet and she can't fit into it yet so hopefully it'll fit her when the time comes.
3.0,"I decided to write this review because I am a Swarovski products collector and these earrings do not totally represent Swarovski elements that I have or have seen. I say this because I have other original swarovski earrings and the elements do not sparkle like their other original products. However I do recommend these earrings to people who wear clip earring. The other point is the picture has several colors and the product has mainly 2 colors, pink and green."
3.0,Got it as a gift. She loves it. She can either have it on her fridge or take it to work. I'm glad I was able to get her to smile.
3.0,"I wanted to love these because the inside and out just feel amazing. But the crotch area is really long - in order for it to not be sagging down, I have to pull them all the way up and then the pants sit too snug on my waist (I’m 118, 5’6”). Length was fine and again they feel amazing, but I want to be able to wear these outside of the house so the crotch thing killed it for me."
3.0,i must admit its gorgeous but as raised my arms up my girls were hanging out..
3.0,The posts are hard to put in your ear
3.0,"I don't have perfect vision so I do wear glasses or contact lenses daily. These are reading glasses and I do tend to read a lot so I said, why not? Well, unfortunately they are not my exact prescription, but they just so happen to be my mom's needed prescription. I knew she would be more than happy to own a pair of these. In fact, I knew she would like it even more to own a set of three, in different colors to match her outfits. She was glad to try them out since her last pair cracked. She says the style is okay. They look alright on her. However, she said they are a tiny bit stiffer than what she is used to. No big deal she said since she only wears them when reading or on the computer. She does like that she has three colors to pick from.<br /><br />I received these reading glasses for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are solely mine and my mom's and in no way influenced."
3.0,nice.....but the color fades...yuck
3.0,I ordered a 2X in this skirt but it was more like a Large. I am returning this item.
3.0,Ordered same size in black and white .The white fits and the black is too small
3.0,"I bought this and the matching hat... I am a big guy but these mustbe sized for children. The neckwarmer feels like a noose, and the hat pops off my bald head without notice."
3.0,"The skirt is very cute, it just runs small. I typically wear an 8/10 so I bought a medium. It was so tight, it burst on the first day. I would say get a size up from your normal size."
3.0,I'm rewriting my review I've had this ring for almost two months and it's not rose gold anymore its turned gold and is darker in some other areas looks like its chipped paint or something..the pearl keeps falling off too..it was super pretty at first now it looks different..
3.0,Bought these for my daughter when she was 20 months and they were small for her. The strap left a mark on her foot and made it difficult to get the shoe off and on. She had a different style of Robeez shoes that fit better than these.
3.0,Nice but not very breathable. I keep sucking in material when breathing or talking. I use it for quick runs but not when I have to go into the office and wear all day.
3.0,"The charms are beautiful, packaging is perfect ,however they were very hard to open"
3.0,Quality seems okay for the price but the color is NOT a shade of blue even though the label says BLUE - it's actually a very pale green.  That's dissappointing but will keep as I need it immediately.  Ordered a 2nd one in army green and the color of that one is spot on.
3.0,"the drawstring around the waist pulls it tighter, but if you tie it it looks silly to have such a small sash, and if you don't tie it, they just hang there looking silly.  The coat is warm, but not super warm.  Not bad"
3.0,"These socks are very soft and the material is very nice. However, the striped pair's stripes came undone in the wash. They were never even worn."
3.0,"Material is good quality but stitching is questionable in a lot of areas .. also seems to be uneven in spots. Buy a size up since it looks more close to my five year olds size than my 8 year old. And for God's sake why does a costume advertised as for a child have cup support sewn into the chest?! Not too disappointed, mainly just confused"
3.0,The sleeves are really tight!  I like the shape of the jacket but the sleeves are not good.
3.0,Not as expected. Looks too cheap.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:c7c39b67e55324cffb0c5854a4c060fb]] El tallaje es pequeño, ordené la talla 11-12 usualmente mi niña es ese size, así que ordené talla 11-12 le quedó un poco ajustado, recomiendo elegir una talla más grande! En cuanto a la tela es de buen material, es una tela fresca y cómoda para verano o días calurosos, Los colores son lindos y llamativos a mi niña le gustó mucho."
3.0,"I bought a medium but it was too big on me. I'm 5'4&#34;, 120lbs, 34b. The fabric is also kind of meshlike, which sometimes makes my underarms stinky so I don't think I'll bother reordering a small. I returned it."
3.0,It's not very comfortable.It's a little too small
3.0,"A little cumbersome to get on the sunglasses I think it would depend on the brand. Once they were snug, they worked as designed."
3.0,"Like the design and style, but the snaps on the back make it not fit as i would like it."
3.0,"The bag is not bad but I was very disappointed with the color. Its much lighter than the picture suggests, its actually lavender not the rich purple but its a solid bag with a top zipper. That is why I decided to keep it."
3.0,"The gold tone is off.  Other than that, cute."
3.0,"The Wonder Woman symbol fell off after a couple of weeks. The Superman one is still on my husbands keychain though. They are cute keychains and we really like them, but it sucks that the symbol fell off so fast. Possibly could have glued it back on if we could have found it."
3.0,"The left leg rode up. I found there was plastic deformation, that is, the leg on the left hand side lost its elasticity as I was walking to the gym. On the whole I was not impressed with the quality of the garment. That related, this is not a very expensive pair of capri tights."
3.0,It shapes my body too much. I guess it doesn’t match my style as much as I thought it would
3.0,"After reading many reviews, I ordered a medium. I am a 32DD and usually a S/M (0-4) in bottoms. I was very confused by the fit. The top would have fit, if my measurement wasn't 32&#34;. Because the back strap is one size, and the front criss-crosses in one spot, there isn't much adjust-ability. The triangles of the fabric offered appropriate coverage. The bottoms were snugger than I would've liked. Very cute color and style, but same-size sets don't often work well for me."
3.0,"2 problems... number 1: the breast portion keeps moving. The insert are removable but they do not sit in place. I was going to just remove them, but you could literally see through. Which brings us to problem Number 2: the color I got was pink. it is COMPLETELY  see through... I was going to return it but I had a pair of black swim bottoms that looked nice with it so I threw them on. Overall it is ok. Not great not bad. You get what you pay for"
3.0,It works like it is supposed to
3.0,Helps when you have your hands full.
3.0,No show but they do slip in the back which is annoying.
3.0,"Size down folks. I'm 135, 5'5"", and the medium is quite big - not that skin-tight flattering look at all. I'm super disappointed, but will keep one pair (bought 2 out of hope haha) for work jeans, because who cares how those look, and I don't want to pay all over again as I dropped $60+ on this risk. If you're one of those people between sizes self-identifying as a smedium, I'd recommend sizing down. Here's a side-by-side of my favorite, most perfect jeans that fit me like a dream vs. these bad bois. Not including a photo of them on me because they just look dumb and flatten my butt/take away every curve horribly. I could wear the new jeans underneath my favorite old jeans."
3.0,"I was really looking forward to getting this product, but the sizing is REALLY off, even beyond my expectations for a product from China. I am usually a small so I ordered a medium and sized up like everyone suggested  I am 5'2&#34;, weighing 125 lbs with an athletic body type, and a size 32B bra size. The top fit really well- it made my small boobs look great. But calling those bottoms a medium size is TOTALLY far fetched. The bottoms looked like an XS & fit like it too! I have hips I guess? Maybe this bottom is too small? I'd suggest to people that know they need the top in one size & the bottoms in another size to buy two sets in each size & then just use the sizes in each that they need. I'm considering buying a large set just to get matching bottoms but really a 125 lb girl buying a large? It makes it hard to predict the sizing.. overall it's a cute swimsuit- too bad it didn't completely fit!"
3.0,Useful and as described
3.0,So in the description it says it was made of stainless steal... it’s not after a few days of wear it began to rust pretty badly around the sides I just threw it away a few days after definitely not worth the wait or the money I spent on it. I was also not as thick as I expected it to be I was thinking about the thickness of a quarter it’s more like a penny with the size of a nickel if that makes sense
3.0,"I like the weight and look of the shirt, but the measurements at the base of the shirt are small and this cause it to gap at the bottom. The rest of the shirt is sized correctly"
3.0,TOo big. Pretty. But heavy and big!
3.0,"Wasnt really impressed, these are just basic not so much in a good way but its better than nothing. I will use these will my suits, still."
3.0,Cute but they run big.  I was not able to get a different size at the same price or a reasonable price.
3.0,"El precio lo dice todo , tiene buena apariencia pero se le nota la mala calidad y se rayó la pantalla con solo lavarlo"
3.0,"Nice sunglasses-but the cover on the nose piece slides right off. Could be more firmly attached, is the reason I had to buy another pair."
3.0,Fits great but only went about 2 inches from my belly button not all the way under the breast. I’m 5’4 220. But squeezes nice
3.0,"These little tee shirts are perfect for layering etc. I bought two packs of shirts, and one of the shirts in one of the packs had some sticking coming out, but nothing I can't fix myself. So maybe quality isn't amazing-- but it will last long enough as my child will grow out of them before wearing them out anyways."
3.0,"I really like the look of the watch, as did everyone that saw it. However I dropped it on the floor after only about 6 months and the ""hands"" broke off. It is also a little bulky, but I got used to it. Very cool watch that I wouldn't complain about if it was a little thinner."
3.0,"These come up much higher on my calves than I expected, and there are areas where the fabric is thinner/not sewn tightly— which will probably lead to holes."
3.0,NIce quality but run soooooooooo small. I am a 4/6 and ordered a medium and it would fit someone who is a 0/2. The waist was like 25 in and the hips were only 34 in! Most mediums at 37 in at least !
3.0,So pretty! Served it’s purpose I gave it three star because the feathers Shed ... LIKE CRAZY. but if u want a longer lasting robe I would t recommend... for a one night only then yes
3.0,Ots a gift so I don't know how well  it will work.
3.0,"They were super cute. Yet, I lost them within one day of traveling. One did not make it through the airline's luggage system and the other fell off somewhere in the streets of Dublin."
3.0,"Pretty dress, but poor construction."
3.0,"the sizing is much too small order up, i cannot wear mine bc shawtys a kids large"
3.0,"I bought this locket for a friend. It is a very pretty locket however, it is nearly impossible to open. I dented the side that opens trying to get it open.It is smaller than I thought it would be. It is slightly larger than my thumbnail. Overall I still like the locket, I just wish it were easier to open."
3.0,I really like the material but it falls off my face. I wish they came in a smaller size.
3.0,"the fabric seems to wear out more quickly than name brand bras of a similar design. Bra slides up and down more than expected. Sizing may not match your usual, so you might want to read carefully before making your purchase."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01N9XPO72 Beachcoco Women's Short Sleeve Maxi Long Dress (M, Burgundy)]]The dress is cute and comfortable. The empire waist is very flattering.. I purchased the medium, I am 5&quot;6', 30inch waist and a 36DD chest. I would purchase more if there were more colors."
3.0,"I gave this a 3 star bc it isn’t true to size. It runs really small, and not at all meant for curves.  Otherwise, it is well made and fabric is nice."
3.0,"This is a nice dress as far as material.. it just didnt meet my expectations once on. Although, I loved the bright color."
3.0,"The gloves are comfortable, they fit me fairly well for being OSFA. I have fingers on the shorter side with otherwise average hands. They have a little room in the fingertips but not so much that they look odd. The palm is a little snug, but not uncomfortable.<br /><br />My big complaint is that only the right index finger is touchscreen capable. I would be much happier if the thumb was as well, and even better if they included the left thumb and index finger. Only one finger is not adequate, nor does it compliment the way I use my phone without gloves. And if you want the touchscreen pad to be discreet, this isn’t it. I’ve read of other customers who colored theirs with a sharpie (usually black sharpie on black gloves) and not had any detrimental effects."
3.0,"Accurate color, shiny, light weight"
3.0,I really liked this watch and searched for because I had it in another color. I only wore it occasionally and was very disappointed when the stem fell out. I contacted the seller and they would not replace it. I would probably buy this model again because it is a very pretty watch.
3.0,"Pretty, however cross back did not fit right, lay flat. This resulted in gap in back of top. I altered it to fall flat. Like the design ,except for issue in back on this one item. Front nice and flowy.Fabric is nice. Wonder if it was this item only with problem, due to mass production."
3.0,"This dress is so pretty and the fabric is very nice quality. I received it quickly. I ordered the gray one and it was really lovely. Unfortunately,  I am returning it.<br />I bought the right size. I know I did because I measured before I picked it, but it's nearly impossible to zip up. Not so much because its too tight as it is because the zipper is hard to lower and raise. The zipper is located on the left side, waist to armpit. When it wouldn't zip well, I took it off and re -zipped it. That's when I realized that, because of the shoulder flap (that sits a little broad), I can't get it on without having the zipper unzipped.<br />I'm not savvy with formal dresses so it might be user error, I just know I was afraid of busting the zipper when trying to close it.<br />It really is a beautiful style. I would have reordered it in a larger size but it's so long, I wouldn't have enough time to have it hemmed. I'm 5'1 so I would need a foot, at least, cut off.<br />It really sucks being short sometimes.<br /><br />I refuse to leave negative feedback rating because their dress line is top-notch and they have earned my business in the future."
3.0,Pretty good quality but I feel like I should have gotten the medium bc the smalls are like Harry Potter/ old grandma small.. but I’m going to keep them. No hate
3.0,Way too much material at bottom of pant legs. They weren't long just wide. Other than that they looked great and for a hiking pant perfect I was bummed to send them back. Too bad the 70s are over.
3.0,"I ordered up a size like most suggested but it still didn't drape like it does on the model in the picture.  I normally wear a medium but ordered a large.  I'm returning it in the hopes that an XXL will fit the way that I want it to.<br /><br />On a side note, I'm hopeful that a three times as large shirt will fit because my 14 year old daughter tried it on and it looked super cute and draped well on her.  Keeping my fingers crossed.<br /><br />Order up a size or two, or three!!!"
3.0,"Definitely did not get the necklace pictured (different colours, and no rhinestones), but it's pretty."
3.0,"The embroidery on the shirt is very nice, but the stitching on the hem and seams is sloppy and threads are loose. It fits pretty much as it should. I probably would not buy again because of the stitching and hem, it's around the house shirt right now."
3.0,A little more green in it than in the ad. Wish it looked more like the one advertised in terms of color.
3.0,"It looks nice in the photos, however the actual product feels a lot cheaper."
3.0,"Nice hat, but too small. Advertised as large/extra large and package and hat are marked &#34;one size&#34;."
3.0,"No era lo que esperaba, el nombre no se ve pues es muy chiquito..."
3.0,Can be a little firmer
3.0,The white cloth is not that thick. Bra is visible
3.0,"The fit is great - I did order a size up, normally a large but got the XL just to be sure & I'm glad I did. They aren't too short & not too long and sit at your natural waist line (no tugging up for these shorts so far). They are light weight. They have good pockets too which is a bonus. The drawstrings are cute little tassels which is hard to see in the picture. The white pattern is indeed painted or glued on :-( & not embroidered which is a bummer because they probably won't wash well. I'll update my review after I wash them a few times. So far I wish they came in different colors."
3.0,Took too long in shipping.  Not exactly what I expected.
3.0,I like the fleece lining. Definitely warm but wouldn't do you well if you'll be outside for an extended amount of time. I gave this three stars because it doesn't actually work on my smartphone. The reason I bought these gloves was so I could use them on my smartphone.  They look great and the fit  is great as well<br /><br />Update: the gloves work on the touch screen in my car which I don't really need as much as my phone.... Also if you use the back of the glove (your knuckles) then you'll be able to use touchscreen on your phone! Yay!....😑<br /><br />Update: December 19 I lost these gloves and I don't even care. The lining in the right hand glove had separated already and my irritation with the lack of versatility of these gloves for any touchscreen runs deep.
3.0,Good quality-just hate that the little balls really don't stay in place well. Lost the ball I don't know how many times until one day it was gone. Shipping accurate and quality-size were perfect.
3.0,"Love the fit of the jacket, but the color was way off as seen in the advertisement... It's more of a camel color, too yellow for my liking..had to return for a different color."
3.0,It's ok.  Had to remove the pads under the boobs cuz they are loose in there moving around
3.0,Super cute top but it was to long and shorts were to small barely fit.
3.0,"The wallet that I received is not the one described or pictured in the listing. What I received is a simple bi-fold wallet and really doesn't have enough credit card slots, nor does it have the two ID windows. I kept it because I needed a wallet and it is of good quality. I like the leather, I just wish that I had got what I ordered. If I had more time when I received it, I would have sent it back to get the one I ordered"
3.0,"They look great, but unfortunately they are not warm."
3.0,"So this looks exactly as it is pictured however, the top part is big and even when it is adjusted...is still big.  Maybe if I was a DD then it would fit better however I'm only a full B."
3.0,"They look super cheap, but what did I expect?"
3.0,This one was better material but the print was not the sa.e as pictured.
3.0,Nice coverall
3.0,"Even with the folded up edge, the hat front sat below my eyes."
3.0,"I should have ordered down a size. The dress is gorgeous. I ordered the gold/cream color. It is a nice, thick but not hot material. It is not see through. I really wish I could have kept it. I am 5'4, 135lbs, and 34C. The dress was too large on the top and hanging off my shoulders. The dress was so long...there were no heels that I owned to even get it off the ground. I would have had to have it hemmed but with the flowy material the hemming job would have been pricey. If you are tall, this dress will work out great. I had to return it."
3.0,I wasn.t overly impressed.
3.0,"Got the 8-10 for my about-to-be-8-yr-old daughter. Definitely has some room to grow, but that was the idea. It's a little loose on top. Note that the turquoise color is a dark turquoise and not a lighter aqua as shown."
3.0,"Panties fit fine, but I ordered assortment package and received all white. Just kept them."
3.0,"I replaced the laces in my Thursday boots with these. I had a little sharp spot on my eyelet of one of my boots. After some time my old laces broke. These laces look exactly like the ones that came in my Thursdays, at 1/2 the cost of new ones from Thursday. They feel like they will last just as long as my old ones.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />My original Thursday boot laces lasted about a year. I’ve had these laces for about 6 months and have not actually worn the boots for about 3 of those months and these are completely falling apart."
3.0,These are descent but run small.
3.0,My girlfriend likes it but the material was not what we expected.
3.0,"These pants will give you pancake/poo butt. They are super comfy for around the house, but I wouldn’t be caught dead in them outside. I wear a size 6 and they look more like MC Hammer pants than what is depicted in the picture when worn."
3.0,Purchased the gold to go with my gold watch and didn’t even come close to matching. Had to return.
3.0,Love the print & quality of the material - Great for the price but the top is cut too small.
3.0,"I got a medium. I usually wear size medium. and they are kind of long. So I should have gotten a small. Other than that, no pockets but super comfy!"
3.0,"It's not bad for $16, but it's more like a sheer,  silky feel to it. I thought it would be more stretchy, but it has NO give to it. The sleeves are not 3/4 long, they are full length. The dress fits me everywhere but in the chest area and I have no boobs (B cup?). Since it has no give, I need to order a bigger size for that. It has a zipper in the back.  It will fit everywhere else, and I think it would be great with a baby bump! It's pretty thin, so if you wear it, you'll need a slip. It's long though. I'm 5'8&#34; and it touches the ground. I ordered a Large, and I weigh 165. Took 18 days to get here. It has pockets though!<br /><br />UPDATE! I feel like this dress is a hit or miss. Others have ordered the same colored dress as mine and got a completely different one (different print and theirs was stretchy with no zipper) so I feel like if you order this dress, it's a luck of the draw on which one you'll get."
3.0,It's good for sleeping in. Not a huge fan of the slinky material.
3.0,The neck part it rolls down to much
3.0,"i am not very happy with the fabric. but i am picky like that. the fabric is a very common type of polyester, just not my favorite."
3.0,It's not what I'm expected.
3.0,Did not work as good as I thought they would.
3.0,"The service and shipment were perfect and the glasses were well packaged and in wonderful condition.  I just couldn't give it a 5 because I tried them and they did nothing for glare for me.  Everybody's body handles things differently and these did nothing for my eyes, sadly.  Sure wish they did."
3.0,Pretty. Not very visible in the ears. Very small.
3.0,"This round purse is pretty cute for a plastic see through bag, but it has a tendency to want to flip over where the opening is facing down. Make sure you always zip it up! Also, it doesn’t hold very much. I knew it wouldn’t when I purchased it, but it’s worth measuring your wallet and phone to see if it’ll be big enough for your needs before you buy one."
3.0,Product is nice but sizing is large and the overall product is not as nice as my previous pair of sandals from LL Bean.
3.0,Edit: Received a full refund<br />This dress runs extremely small and the small amount of gathering in the back does not help. The material is beautiful but absolutely no stretch. I ordered 2 size too large and it’s still too small
3.0,"I gave these three stars because when they fit, they fit well. Unfortunately the fit is wildly inconsistent - and always too small. This time I bought mediums and figured they would shrink to the small that I am. And for the most part that is what happened. At  least one pair, however, did not fit properly out of the bag. If AS can get their quality control down then I think they will have a very good product. Until then you will be taking your chances with fit."
3.0,Even though I bought an extra large one it was still tight in the arms.  It also had a strange smell to it.  After several washings and airing on the porch the odor is gone.  Not sure what that was all about.  It works for what I needed as a limited wear costume.
3.0,Not the best workmanship.  Had to make a repair.
3.0,"Dress is smaller than expected, will give it to my daughter"
3.0,I bought this band 5 days ago for $ 8.50<br /><br />What gives ???<br /><br />Band is fine except I can't figure out how to shorten it otherwise it would be 4 stars ( at $8.50 )
3.0,"Warm, perfect fit and very soft.  The colors were as expected on the set with the deer.  The second set that I bought was ugly.  The colors couldn't have been much worse.  Of course, this set I had bought for a friend for Xmas.  May have to keep them because I would hate to see my friend's expression."
3.0,Disappointed very small
3.0,"Not expecting highest quality, but I think it should be better. still feel my feet cold inside. I think it'll be better for any one to really order a size and half beyond ur normal size to give enough room for soaks. Just manageable."
3.0,They are nice enough. But get dirty quickly. One girl was already peeling
3.0,"I bought this last minute for a breast cancer event at work and it fulfilled its purpose. It’s pink.  If I had purchased this to be a serious member of my wardrobe, I’d be disappointed. It is very thin and I don’t understand the purpose of it being made out of stretchy fabric. It will probably end up being a nightgown for me in the summer. It is a very long tunic  I am 5‘7“ and have a long torso and it was still very long on me."
3.0,"I think these earrings are very pretty and my wife<br />appreciated them as a gift but alas, the quality of the butterflies<br />to keep them on her lobes was inadequate. After searching for a butterfly that<br />popped off for the fourth time they were put away. Perhaps we can take them<br />to a jeweller who can find butterflies that would hold better. With better<br />butterflies I would change my review to a five, as the turquoise colour and the<br />earrings shape are beautiful."
3.0,"I am 5’3”, 180#, typically size 12/33 in jeans.  I bought these in the speckled off-white color in a size large.<br />I find that they run a little large. One nice feature is they have pockets, but generally I think you could get equal quality sweatshirts and jogger pants separates at other retailers for less money<br />I also wish the background color of this was the oatmeal it’s described instead of the off-white. Oatmeal even with the colored sprinkles would look better on me"
3.0,The item was way too long.
3.0,"Really wanted to make these my go-to sunglasses for all the reasons cited by other reviewers. But they weren't quite big enough to cover my specs, and I found the &#34;gap&#34; at the bottoms of my lenses too distracting. Otherwise, they're excellent sunglasses and well worth buying if they'll fit your specs. If the nosepiece gets in the way of fitting over your specs, a couple of small screws can be removed with a jeweler's screwdriver, then remove the nosepiece and they fit over specs just fine."
3.0,"From the pictures, I was expecting this to be longer so it could circle the neck and drape over itself, as it does in the pictures.  Mine is way too short to do that.  This will have to go to a small child.  It is not big enough for an adult.  All that being said, it is soft and cute.  Just wish it was bigger."
3.0,Material was expected to be like a sweatshirt. I was disappointed that it is not soft or warm like a sweatshirt. Feels like a heavy athletic shirt.
3.0,"Pros- The band is nice looking and the black color really looks sharp with my Blaze.<br />Cons - Removing links is no small chore and the instructions are basically worthless, too small to see.  Make sue you remove links on a solid surface because if it has any give at all the little pins take forever to remove.  Also, the band makes a rattling noise when I receive a notification on my Blaze.  I'm guessing it's because the band doesn't fit tightly enough around my Blaze."
3.0,Las mangas son muy cortas queda que parece de niña y es frágil la tela
3.0,These are nice but the sole is  very flat<br />You feel like you’re walking very hard on the floor
3.0,Super cute but not comfortable at all
3.0,"the watch was delivered faster than expected. Which was good(1star). The color is on point(1star). The packaging & casing was excellent(1star). 3stars that's it, because the watch has no weight to it. Which means, it feels cheaply made...& the blue paint looks like it can be washed right off. If the watch had more weight, the band wider & worth the money I spent. This would've been 5 stars."
3.0,It was nice but I ordered the brown one and received the tan one
3.0,Pretty cool but really cheap made
3.0,I bought a small and it looks like I'm wearing a trash bag
3.0,"It's a cute hat. However, although mys sister always called me a fat head-this is very big for me. I didn't return because of return policy which is pay fto ship it back and up to 20% restock fee. Not worth all the effort."
3.0,I got a large and it was way to small. Very cute though. I wish it did fit.
3.0,"Oversized, but warm and comfy. Good for the cost. I use it primarily under a second layer and so the looks don't matter, but this would look very ugly if worn by itself."
3.0,"Very nice, but is to large"
3.0,Cute but very thin. Ran very small so I had to give it to my daughter.
3.0,very flimsy did not last
3.0,"I bought this dress for my baby to be blessed in, but unfortunately ended up returning it.<br /><br />Pros- really cute, fit my 3 month old pretty well<br /><br />Cons- flowers seemed really cheap and weren’t attached to the dress very well, sleeves were too long (ended up rolling them up and it looked ok), but biggest issue was that the dress part was totally see through! You could see her stomach, diaper, and legs easily. I tried to make it work but couldn’t get over the fact it was so easy to see through and ended up returning it and getting something slightly less cute but that wasn’t as thin and cheap."
3.0,"I love these and my old one wore out. This looked nice, with a lot of slots for it's size, but it is tight. I can only put in 3 cards before it is too tight to get in any more. It needs more slack so you can fit in more than 3 cards, since there are more slots than that. I wish it came in red, too."
3.0,I was disappointed with the quality of this bracelet.  The goddess image is pretty but the leather is a little flimsy.
3.0,I suggest style for a slim body person..
3.0,Excellent but they rip easy.
3.0,Does not look like picture at all! It's a basic t-shirt.
3.0,my grand daughter needs to rate
3.0,"Some might like the thickness of it, I don't. I wear these to cover my head it felt bulky. However, as a face covering, it would be breathable and warm for the winter."
3.0,"They fit well and the material is strong, but the side bottom popped off the first time my daughter put them on."
3.0,this one is definitely cheaper than the scratchmenot 24.95 plus 6 bucks for shipping mittens. That one also stretches a lot and tears easily.<br />This worked out well over the last 2 months. no rips. i think its still expensive considering the simple piece of clothing that it is and that it is for kids suffering from eczema
3.0,"An okay watch for the price.  There are some flaws one wouldn't expect to see in a Swiss Watch.  For example, the chronograph second hand doesn't line up with the 12 hour mark when reset.  It was worth the money, but probably not worth the original $395 this watch retails at. The band makes the watch look pretty casual, so I switched it out with a 19mm black leather band. The dial is not as stark white as the photo indicates, but I actually think this is an improvement."
3.0,"The Nike Triax Super Fury 100 gets mistakenly included by Amazon when doing a search for heart rate monitors. I became aware that it's NOT an HR monitor when I opened the box and read the instructions. Beware, don't do the same. It's a good-enough watch for timing runs, etc. but nothing special. There is a charge for returning the watch; so I just kept it. I then went to my local Big 5 sports store and purchased the HR monitor that I wanted."
3.0,"Just as  the  other scarf I reviewed, this was definitely not a quality item.  That said, you get what you pay for and with the great price of this item, it will suffice."
3.0,"Size up! I ordered a L as recommended, fits really tight across chest (I'm a 34C)."
3.0,"I was expecting them to be thicker like the socks I could buy at Costco. Disappointing, too thin,"
3.0,Not much spandex to this compression too
3.0,"Nice jacket for my daughter.  I chose size medium, which is a bit larger than she normally wears (and a size up from the recommended size). It was a bit too small for the outer shell to be able to zip all the way up. She did not want to return it but I wish I would have chosen Large – even though she have never worn anything that size."
3.0,"She says they're warm enough, yet most of the little pom poms attached fell off really easily."
3.0,If you're not a gym model this isn't the best stringer arm holes are too big I pull down the shirt in the front my nipples are out but if if I pull it down from the back my stomach shows I've bought others the same size and I haven't had this issue
3.0,"Unflattering, too stretchy after 10 minutes, polyester fabric is NOT BREATHABLE, and DOES NOT SHRINK. I would recommend Down size at least ONE size. The color is good."
3.0,"Too small, would have loved it if it fit. Loved the fabric."
3.0,I ordered a size above what I would usually order because the reviews said it ran small. This is very true. It runs fairly tight around the arms and shoulders.  I have a wide frame and I find that even going with a size above normal the shoulders are still a little tight. The quality of the fabric is not great. And the stitching is a little weird but not really noticeable when wearing it. The tool underneath  is rather uncomfortable and I would recommend a slip with it.  All that being said I plan on keeping it. It is a cute summer dress with a reasonable length for tall women. (I am 5’11”) The way the dress rests on the shoulders bra straps will show. Recommend strap less or no bra with the dress.
3.0,It is really tight on the arms and the stitching is coming undone some. I've only worn it a couple of times. Can't really raise my arms in the shirt and I got a large.
3.0,"These look so cute on like so cute. Not too big, not too small, flattering for many shapes but one of the lenses has a gouge in it. I'll still wear them but it's a visible little gouge."
3.0,Beautiful fabric. Much too big for my needs.
3.0,"The corset itself was exactly as I expected it just got the wrong size, go larger than you think you need to"
3.0,Not that easy to put on. I really loved the confetti one but spending more time every day to put it on. May be it's too early to write a review. Will update if anything changes.
3.0,"Item was as expected. Seems to repel water fine. It came out of the bag with a terrible smell and I had to wash it before I could stand to wear it. I don’t think it’s as fitted as it looks in pictures. I normally wear a medium but I got a large so I could wear a long sleeved fleece under it and it’s a tiny bit tight in arm pits/when I raise my arms up. The fleece inner lining is a nice touch and definitely makes it a little cozier than most wind breakers. It’s decent, but no frills and not super stylish."
3.0,Uncomfortable and doesn't stay in.
3.0,"I bought this to wear to my aerobics workout classes. Mostly good quality. The lace is really nice, the zipper lays flat--mostly. The lace allows for a lot of cooling effect during an intense class. The empire waist hit just below the bust, and it is lined, so it can be worn without a bra.<br /><br />The zipper is attached in an awkward way just at the neck line, making the neck pull up into a point, which ruins what I had hoped would be a neat, smooth mock effect. I have to wear it unzipped, making it a V-neck instead. This is not the end of the world, but I did choose this because I really wanted a mock-turtleneck.<br /><br />The sizing is very inaccurate. I usually wear a women's medium size. I do not have the largest female frame, though I am tall (5'8&#34;) and my rib cage measures 36&#34;. Usually a large size in women's clothing is a little big on me because I am very fit rather than overweight. I wanted to have just a little extra room in this leotard, so instead of purchasing a medium, I chose large. I just barely fit into it, but the tightness is quite evident because it distorts the shape of the neckline even further, as well as being uncomfortable in my armpits. In particular, I had to cut the arm holes to make them at least an inch bigger in diameter.<br /><br />For $30 it's a really nice leotard--if you're small enough to fit into it! If you're a medium-sized woman and you are not willing to alter brand-new clothing, I'd look for something bigger."
3.0,"Nice and warm.  With the other reviews I got two sizes larger and it fits great.  The downside is that the coat only closes with snap buttons.  With alot of movement (shoveling, etc) the buttons frequently pop open."
3.0,Way smaller than I expected. Definitely not the size I ordered quality seemed good. Just wasted time.
3.0,Pretty color and would have been flattering if it were a size smaller.  Need to order a size smaller than you normally would wear in this top.
3.0,Looks better in photo.  Not large enough to be noticed that it is a keyboard.<br />Made in China .... hope the metal content is safe.
3.0,I’ll have to give this away.
3.0,Blue pen was dry but otherwise as advertised.
3.0,"Very cute and warm, but it she's like crazy.  Tiny fibers that get all over clothes."
3.0,Great looking shoes but way too big
3.0,"First, we received a dress that was significantly different from the picture. We believed it to be a wrong item and simply exchanged it. Second, we received an item that was similar but not identical to the dress in the picture. The solid under-layer of this two-layer dress is cut differently from the photos. The bust line is straight across and really rather unflattering. The photos show a subtle v-neck and also a form fitting contour. This dress is a straight sheath dress, with a straight-line bust, from armpit to armpit, which isn't attractive. The outer lace-layer is lovely, very soft and silky, and it has wonderful drape, but, that bust line is just not attractive. On a fuller figured woman, it looks a bit cheap and unfinished, like they ran out of fabric. On a smaller-chested woman, it looks unflattering because it falls too low. Overall, this could be salvaged, with some creative sewing, but you'd have to know how to sew. I can't recommend this to anyone who can't sew, in order to tailor the bodice properly. Good luck finding what will work for you. This is a three star dress, because to get it to look good, you have to be able to tailor it."
3.0,"It is ok, but for me it is too thick. I would have preferred something not as wide. Feels heavy on your arm, my opinion."
3.0,"After reading the reviews I bought a size smaller than I normally wear and they don't fit properly, too small. nice color and light weight denim. But I was going for more of a jegging.... not so much the case here."
3.0,"While the color is very pretty, the material is very thin. There are several loose threads and places where the crochet part is coming up from the shirt (see pictures). If you need it for a one time event it would probably be fine but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. It does however fit well. And I love the off the shoulder look. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
3.0,The colors are really vibrant and pretty. It is about 2 sizes smaller than I normally wear and doesn't have much stretch at all. I am 5&quot;1' and 165 lbs and usually wear size L. I bought XL and it is still slightly smaller than I'd like.
3.0,"I order a small or medium in every shirt and blouse I buy from Amazon. I bought this in a medium and it was too tight/clingy (maybe bc the material was a little stretchy) but the white was also see through. I'm not looking to wear a tank top under it, so I'm returning it. If large was an option I might try it on black bc the shirt is really cute in person and seems to be a decent quality for the price, but it only comes in S, M, XL and XXL for some reason."
3.0,No.The voice was very very low.I am thinking of getting another one for my dad.
3.0,"Bought size based on Carhartt website. The pants fit too tight around the tops of the thigh (the are &#34;fitted&#34; through hip and thigh) but the lower legs were huge. I sent them back. I didn't bother to order a larger size since I was afraid the legs would just be silly big. I liked the fitted waist band, but felt it sat a little low for doing more than just standing around. YMMV as I am very long in the torso."
3.0,The necklace was very cute but broke very easily
3.0,"Cotton is not soft, just okay. It has seams on the crotch area. If your kiddo is fuzzy about seams these ones are not for him. Designs are nice, they look right sized. Unfortunately they are going back."
3.0,"Pros: Durable, stylish, great fit.<br /><br />Cons: Mine unties easily. It has fallen off my wrist during gym and while I've been out doing activities with my kids. When I wear it, I'm afraid I might loose my watch. It needs an extra band to prevent the hook from detaching."
3.0,It is beautiful. Look how it is depicted. Its on the smaller side and doesn't stretch very much. To tight to wear.
3.0,"I Love this dress, its very beautiful and fits<br /> me elegantly."
3.0,Product looks good but clasp is flimsy.  Black necklace clasp was broken out of the box.  Wanted to give as a birthday gift but had to order another gift as a result.
3.0,Very disappointed in this bracelet.  I was washing my hands and the black on the beads rubs off on my wrist.  Must not be real stones.😢
3.0,"It's ok, thought it would fit more off the shoulder like the picture, more of a shirt fit"
3.0,Returned- way too big. Return was super easy tho.
3.0,"Only came with two colors- light grey and a darker grey. Hilariously labelled as “FORYOURDEAR” on the front! V. comfortable though, thank goodness.."
3.0,Came very wrinkled with the bow falling apart.
3.0,For me these engulfed my face. They were so big. I returned them.
3.0,Looks ok but i was expecting a winter hoodie and got a snug fit under armor material
3.0,"Not sure if he liked the cap or not. I don't live near him so I've never seen him wear it. Said he liked it, but, well..."
3.0,They were so nice. But my daughter had them for a month before the buttons started falling off.
3.0,Cute. 2 of the charms didn't have the backing to clip onto our crocs.
3.0,The shoulders fit like a a skinny teanager and it runs short.
3.0,"I like it, fit perfect.<br /> I had purchased 18mnths, she is 12mnths was hoping for a little more room. Overall super cute just be mindful of size and possibly size up."
3.0,"Sizes run small by at least two inches.  NO stretch in the waist, although it does have limited stretch in the legs.  Really like the style so I'd definitely reorder in a different size."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01IEZU8CC Mordenmiss Women's Fall Cotton Linen Printing Dress Robe with Pockets (Style1-Black)]]<br />Lovely style, however, the color is too dark for my needs. Always a pleasure working with Mordenmiss."
3.0,"This shirt is very thin and awfully tight for a “large”. The arms are tight, which means wearing it over a shirt with sleeves won’t work. Definitely wouldn’t work for wearing over scrubs. And it’s so thin I can see my bra straps through the back even with another shirt on underneath.<br /><br />On the positive side, it’s cut well and long in the arms. The coral color I got is gorgeous. I’ll keep it, but it was lot thinner and tighter than I’d been expecting. Luckily it’s pretty stretchy."
3.0,"Like the message, seems like not alot of protection.  Gonna gift it."
3.0,"They r lite weight but adjusting them is a pain.  Takin them on an off becomes problematic. Maybe after some use they will adjust easier. In the meantime, its a struggle but they do keep glasses from slippin dwn nose."
3.0,"Worked great the first time used. The second time, 2 ""claws"" fell off. I will use gorilla glue or E6000 to try and glue them back on...😳"
3.0,A little too big to use as a bracelet charm I had to return but I think would be good for necklaces.
3.0,Too long waisted
3.0,"Cute....but short in the torso, smushes down your chest, and too cheeky for my taste. Tried to return, post office sent back with a note that said &#34;moved a year ago.&#34;"
3.0,Felt as though after a couple of wears they would stretch. Feels good in til you wear awhile
3.0,"Pretty but it’s not a dress, it’s a tunic. My ass would hang out if I wore it as a dress, it’s extremely short and I’m 5’2”. It was very loose. I’ll probably take it in some otherwise it has no shape."
3.0,"I LOVE these shoes but have to return them. They’re just not comfortable for me. I tried them on, and can already feel my feet hurting. There’s no way I’d make it through a day wearing them. They’re also slightly larger than expected for my normal size, super heavy, and have some tiny imperfections in craftsmanship. I’m so sad that these gorgeous booties didn’t work for me."
3.0,It was ok. I didn't like the fit on me! Returned it
3.0,The torso area is a bit shorter than it looks on model and the shoulders are a puffy but looks good with a sweater or jacket and the pattern is cute.
3.0,"I really loved the luster of the silver that this pendant was made of, really good shine to it, more so than a sterling silver chain that i own.<br />It would have been a perfect purchase but the top of the pendant that attaches the pendant to a chain broke. The silver is thin and it was bound to happen."
3.0,"My son normally wears a 2, I ordered a 3 to be safe and it's still squishing his toes a bit. Still a good shoe just consider a much larger size"
3.0,.....pull these up my thighs. I'm 5'6 and 120 lbs and I wear a size 2 normally. I ordered the large (small US size) and it was just not gonna happen for me.  If you have any hips or booty these are not for you! I gave 3 stars because they are well made with great fabric just too small.
3.0,It's okay; but fits really awkward.
3.0,"Hard to hook and unhook, but very pretty."
3.0,Very pretty colors but too tight and thin
3.0,Size is not right so make sure if your a man order at least 1 size bigger!
3.0,On the smaller side
3.0,&#34;Free size&#34; permanently knitted in white thread on foot of sock.  Why?
3.0,They are pretty but tiny. That is why I am only rating them 3 stars. A little pricey for such small earrings.
3.0,It says it was a size 8. Not even close. More like a size 5. Disappointing
3.0,"Clearly, this item is cheap. I was surprised by how cheap. It comes apart easily. Fortunately I didn't lose my pendant, but the chain was frustratingly fragile. Given the price of the item, I gave it three stars. If you buy cheap you get a cheap product!"
3.0,"I ordered this dress for a fall wedding. It is super cute,, wouldn't call it ""elegant"" however. Very comfortable,  light weight fabric, but if you have large hips, like I do, this is not the most flattering style for women like us!"
3.0,It's see through.... The material is so thin. I used it for pirate day at Faire and glad I wore a bra.....otherwise it would have shown everything.
3.0,"These socks fit well but are really way too thin, it also appears that the silver threads are only in the instep, the benefits of silver is that it kills germs so your socks won't smell, but in that case I would think you really need it at the toes."
3.0,"I bought this for my 11 year old, thinking he is youth. It the hat was way too small. It does fit my 7 year old and he loves it. It looks great on him!"
3.0,Style is cute but runs very small. Not a sensible nursing bra.
3.0,"Loved the color and the buttons were nicely done. The issue for me was that the split was too high and a bit wide/ revealing, I am tall (5 foot 9 inches).<br />The dress fit but was pretty fitted..."
3.0,Fabric looks and feels inexpensive. The fit is tight like leggings. Waistband is small. Not for women who arent thin or have hips
3.0,I loved the watch but it arrived broken
3.0,Now this is the one I order in small and fitted like a large too big it looks like a men’s shirt
3.0,It's not the best quality.
3.0,"This dress has two layers, but it's still completely sheer. You'll definitely need a slip to wear underneath. But it was only $13 and it's going to work fine for what I need."
3.0,It’s nice but black started coming off after I put on oils
3.0,Era para mi sobrina
3.0,"Works well, the only problems I have with it is the arm doesn't come back far enough and the button doesn't seem to be very high quality."
3.0,"I love the cut of this coat, but the button was hanging on by a thread, and it I think its overpriced for the quality of material. Note that it has an odd looking large white plastic snap just on the front so you can snap it shut, then use the large black button"
3.0,"This shirt seems to run small. I usually wear a size large, so that’s the size I ordered. I’m able to wear it, but it’s very form fitting, snug around my arms, and on the short side. Going up a size would probably lead to a much better fit.<br /><br />The shirt has a tie dye look with blue, pink and yellow stripes. The colors aren’t super bright but still nice shades. The material feels like typical t-shirt fabric and has stretch to it. I had no issues washing the shirt as directed in cold water and machine drying on low."
3.0,"Nice quality, but i ordered a large, and it fit me perfectly, but I couldn't wear anything bulky underneath.  It came right below my waist, but was hoping it would have come down a little further."
3.0,"I was very excited that I was going to be getting this shirt in time for the game. It did come on time, but ended up not fitting. I was very disappointed."
3.0,Did not like when i received it. Size bigger than i expected
3.0,I bought these pack of tank tops. It just fit big and they aren’t slimming. And I bought smaller. They did feel cool under my shirts when I do yard work. But I thought it would be something like shapewear
3.0,"The robe is really soft.  It has loops for a tie, but has no tie. It also has a small hole in one of the pockets."
3.0,"I like the color & the fit, despite the fit being less flowy than the picture. The fanatic is stiff & cannot be dried so can’t use fabric softener. I’d say it would definitely look best on very thin, petite girls & as for the rest of us, it’s a little tablecloth-ish."
3.0,Too big for my 7 year old and too small for me (petite adult female). It presses on my nose and falls off my daughters face.<br /><br />It’s nicely lined so I assume it’s quite warm.
3.0,"Overall, a good looking product; however, the size and close proximity of winders and small diameter of watch holders creates a challenge to use with men's size watches without having to make major adjustments to the holders, which can be difficult to maneuver."
3.0,"After a year or so, started to peel off"
3.0,"Not bad, not great. Glad they're adjustable"
3.0,"This is a size Medium and I'm usually a small/medium. It is NOT oversized. In fact, it is small. The sleeves are short and it barely goes to my butt. I will still wear it but it is not the style of shirt I thought I was getting."
3.0,"I ordered 2 different colors, and  the fabric type was different on both. I ended up returning the blue, because it was a weird thick fabric with a sheen to it. But I loved the white one I recieved"
3.0,"Good Jacket. Was just too small and thin for what I thought it was going to be. Amazon and the shipping company made it super easy to return though, Thank you."
3.0,"I bought this for Europe but soon found out it was uncomfortable and if you had several items in it, it became more of a problem than help . I felt safe with it but just not made for cross body wear and too cumbersome for shoulder bag. It kept falling down arm. Will look for backpack!"
3.0,The gold metallic swirl is not as gold/bright as the pictures of the product.
3.0,I ordered a large and it was small. Very pretty shirt but the material doesn't stretch at all
3.0,These are very thin belts. You will need to lose weight around your belly if you don't want it flipping up on you each time you sit and stand. The width is not very wide either.
3.0,Much bigger than expected. Its cute and came on time.
3.0,Kind of does the job. Color bleeds when it comes in to contact with hair oils. I also wear them inside out because the inside fabric isn’t satin. Imagine what your hair looks & feels like after getting a fresh silk press and falling asleep on a regular pillow. That’s kind of the effect the inside of these bonnets have on my hair.
3.0,It’s ok not for me looked better in the picture- I have it away
3.0,"Even though the bag is somewhat larger than expected, was happy with it, but one of the snaps on a front pocket is broken. Like the color, but will return it...."
3.0,Not great quality. Price reflects it.
3.0,BEaUty but the belt was took as well
3.0,Coming apart only wear once
3.0,Beautiful and high quality but way too big and I am on the larger side for a small and this was enormous! Wish this came in an XS if this is their sizing!
3.0,Material thin.
3.0,"The material of the shirt it self it’s good but the print on it it’s really bad quality , kind of blurry."
3.0,The back is flat. :(
3.0,The dress just made me look super boxy. Not the dress for my body type.
3.0,It is cute but it's a little small. I normally wear a small and the medium I ordered is too short to wear without leggings. Also a little snug but not too bad. I will wear it when it gets a little cooler out with leggings.
3.0,Runs small and shrink.
3.0,"These look nice but they got on my nerves.  They kept fogging up, some places told me I still needed a mask.  It was like a prescription in the glasses or not, but it made my vision a little weird."
3.0,"Xenuay Men's Casual Long Sleeve Shirts V Neck Henley Shirts Button Up Linen Cotton Work Business-<br /><br />This shirt isn't the best but it's not the worst either.  There are several spots in which the thread is sticking out and can be pulled loose.  Granted the price point is very affordable so I wasn't expecting the highest quality but still, this feels a bit cheap. The shirt isn't the worst though.  It doesn't look bad once I was able to get out the majority of the wrinkles which is difficult with this fabric.  I do like how light the fabric is. For an area like FL where I am I look for very breathable fabric and thus far this has felt breathable.<br /><br />As far as sizing goes, this fits about how I would expect it to.  I wore an undershirt in the picture and when I wear it with that it is a bit too tight for me.  I wish it was a bit longer though being 6'1'' 230 I tend to like longer/tall shirts.  Since this has the V cuts on the side it makes it so I can't wear this without an undershirt at this length.  I like the look of those cuts but I would need to go a size up to wear this without a shirt underneath.  I usually wear the size I tested for this review so if I were to order again I would go a size up.<br /><br />All in all, it's an ok shirt.  I like the price point and if it fits me a bit better I would order more for work.  I like how this isn't fully formal but still fits a business casual setting.  I worry that this will not hold up to multiple washes.  If it was made a little longer I would order more as the price point is tempting."
3.0,Way too small despite the size label of 2-4t. My 3 year old is small for her size and these socks didn't cover her entire foot. Too bad because she otherwise loved them but I had to return them.
3.0,nice look way to small
3.0,Much larger than it appears. It appears that the heart was opaque butbis actually clear glass. Good quality
3.0,Thinner material than expected... also smaller than anticipated... normally wear a size XL in US sizes...
3.0,Not sure how to contact the seller however we really enjoyed our beautiful purse except there was an ink stain on one of the handles of the purse. Unfortunately my wife was a little displeased about it. I looked everywhere for the sellers email address I couldn't find anything. Maybe they'll read the review and contact us. Otherwise the purse is exactly as described and it's extremely beautiful with lots of pockets and plenty of room. I would post some photos of The purse but don't know how to do it for this review. Thank you.
3.0,I got a small and the dress is WAY too loose. But it’s beautiful so I’ll keep and stash  it for  when I  inevitably gain weight.
3.0,"The fit was too small, and the color nowhere near advertised. It came in as a reddish maroon. Disappointed. Cute dress but needed the actual color"
3.0,"Runs small, sleeves are kind of too long for the shirt.  Soft fabric.  Shrinks a little so wash in cold water.  Sloppy workmanship.  Material is okay."
3.0,I liked the look just didnt like the flare at the bottom and the material was thinner then expected.
3.0,I like the watch but one came broke out of two ordered
3.0,I don’t like the laptop slot in the middle of the bag.  It would have been nice to have that as a item that could be removed if needed
3.0,Just okay. Fit is so so. Legs a little too short. Waist is not very comfortable. Liked the colors.
3.0,Beautiful dress but material is a little cheap on top
3.0,Comfortable and perfect but runs small. Every time I order shirt I order xl. I should have ordered 3xl
3.0,"The material isn't great, came kind of wrinkled but you cannot iron it. The dress is overall cute. If you are a women with a large bust, the top might be a little tight."
3.0,The grip came off in a week
3.0,I'm 5'9&#34; and I got the orange and white/blue leafy long sleeved. I do not recommend this style for someone of my height. It fit great towards the bottom but the torso was short so the neckline was dragged down and the breast cups were awkwardly placed. I think it would have been great if I had a shorter torso.
3.0,"Cute color and cute style, just too short and young looking for me!"
3.0,Runs a little big. I wear a small and i ordered a small based off of reviews. My waist is pretty small but to say this nicely my bottom half could fit a medium. I thought it would fit perfectly but it was just a little too big. The quality was good though and i will be reordering a XS
3.0,"I sized down in this shirt because of the length. It’s still long enough to cover my bottom if I choose to, and not too tight. Shirt is see through so you will need a cami or dark bra. Basic shirt, nice for everyday purposes. Nothing special!"
3.0,Size not right. Not a 2xl shirt
3.0,"Beautiful! But tricky to put it on by myself, it also collects a lot of dirt."
3.0,Nice but can barely see and read the lettering.  It’s very small.
3.0,This product runs very small.
3.0,Good quality but it’s actually way brighter than the picture makes it look. It’s look-aid red. And I’m a size 4-6 top and if fits a little small. Most “small” sizes fit me just right and medium fits me too big but if I had known I would have picked medium for this one. I’m keeping it because I can wear it for Christmas but I don’t think I’ll be able to wear it at work like I had planned.
3.0,This top doesn’t fit well. Loose on top but tight at waistline. No Lululemon. Lol<br /><br />The fabric doesn’t breathe well. Too hot for doing CrossFit.
3.0,a little on the smaller end of large size
3.0,Gave 3 stars because fabric is thin and the sizing runs small. Not happy with this purchase at all. Would not recommend!
3.0,Very Clingy material.
3.0,The Hoodia had a dirty spot right in front.
3.0,"I may have gone through a wishful thinking moment when I visualized these earrings while at the same time expecting a product worth the money I paid. The latter turned out to be the case. The earrings are cute, I've worn them because I needed this color and they look nice. I can't determine whether it's really a very thin layer of turquoise(if that's even possible) or some synthetic imitation so I will hold judgement on the veracity of the description on Amazon."
3.0,"Adorable design but it came with a broken zipper and lots of loose threads. I had to return the item, the company was very professional and easy to work with."
3.0,"Absolutely love the look of this necklace, however I was wearing it everyday and it did start to change color."
3.0,Yes. Its hooded but it's not what I think of when I think sweatshirt. I think warm and fuzzy not thin and silky
3.0,Nothing special.  I have to keep fixing it to look like scurnchie...comes with a matching one for your hair
3.0,"I really wanted to like these- I really did, but they just didn't cut it for me.<br /><br />PROS: Bought all 3 colors, so you could stack them up for a more rugged style. The closure is actually very nice! In addition to a weak-ish magnet, it has a lock-in closure that makes it very easy to do on yourself.<br /><br />CONS: They really just didn't fit! I bought them as a present for my boyfriend who has normal-sized wrists, and they wrap around 3 times, hanging very loosely and uncomfortably but not enough material to wrap a 4th time. Also the material is very cheap and rough- but not in a good way. The box & product looked very high quality at first, but once you used them you realize how low quality they are. The tape on the box from when they packaged it ripped the cover of it off, and it bent more easily than cardboard.<br /><br />Overall, you get what you pay for. Unless you have extremely thick wrists you won't be able to use these."
3.0,This dress fit smaller than expected- maybe a size too small.  The material is very thin and not too much stretch in it at all.
3.0,Ordered 24 adult size of these hats for mostly children to wear in a parade. Thanks to earlier reviews I knew they would fit very small. These hats were too small for adult males and fit even the smallest children well. I added elastic bands to the hats so that they would stay on.  Many of the stickers were crooked but not too bad.
3.0,"You need an extra few inches to make this buckle work.  I have another belt with the same length and it has length to spare, this belt is too short for  me to latch it.  It is the length it is listed as but the buckle needs some length to get latched."
3.0,"I was really excited to get this product to use for when I play sports. However, you can only use this product where it cannot be seen as it dries to the white powder instead of staying invisible. Unfortunately I can cannot use it on my thighs to prevent rubbing when I run unless I want snowball white legs. This also means that you have to be careful when using it on your bottom because there may be white residue. This product is also very clumpy when you spread it on."
3.0,It almost looks like a beanie style rather than baseball. It's a little flat on top but that might be due to being squished in the package. I'm waiting to see if it &#34;puffs&#34; out a bit now that it is out of the package and being worn.
3.0,"It's not full back heated as the photo shows,  I feel the heat on my lower back."
3.0,"The glow in the dark function only lasts a few seconds after the lights go down so if you don’t go immediately from full sun to full darkness it functionally doesn’t work where as many other pairs I’ve had absorb light more readily and glow for way longer, but the plugs are comfortable and it’s a nice thought to add the tunnels in as well as the plugs and spikes; not a bad product just doesn’t glow very long"
3.0,"I loved this when I put it on.  It is comfy.  The only thing is that as I went about my day, I noticed that the print was getting a rubbed out look near where my tummy area where seat belt and purse contacted material on first wear."
3.0,Bought it to be able to use while playing sports. It broke in the first week while I was moving. The clasp broke off
3.0,Did not look like picture! It just barely comes to waist band of pants and it has a band At the bottom.
3.0,"I thought it would be much bigger, a little disappointed in the size other than that it was okay."
3.0,"This set is nice and thick, so it's not clingy or see-through, which makes it great for a lazy Saturday. It's not the softest, though, so I don't really like sleeping in it. It also shrunk a little in the wash."
3.0,Haven’t worn it yet but it’s waaaaay thinner than I thought it would be. Very blousey feel and meant for fashion look not to keep you warm
3.0,They were cool!
3.0,Very stiff leather but lots of room. The purse is worth the $25.00 spent on it.
3.0,Very pretty. Do wish it was smaller.
3.0,"The hats are cute, but they are much thinner than I expected. They don’t really stand up like a normal Santa hat would."
3.0,This is perfect if you have a flat stomach. The pants feel amazingly soft!! But I have a tiny mom tummy and they looked awful.
3.0,"Took long to receive.  I am usually a Medium, but i ordered large.  Still fit snug, but it os cute."
3.0,"Really hard go get them to stay in place, even with following the directions. Good enough for the price"
3.0,allergic reaction to the material.
3.0,"I have a dream of finding the perfect strapless bra. Sadly, my hunt is still on. And maybe it is futile as I tend to wear a 38 D/DD. I got this bra in the hopes that a bandeau (tube top) bra would work better than a standard strapless, but apparently I hoped in vain. It is probably not the bra's fault, I probably just do not understand how to properly fit a bandeau bra. In either case, this bra did not work very well for me.<br /><br />I requested a Large size bra, as this closely resembled the size I wear in a standard bra, and while the bra fit around my back just fine, it did nothing for my chest. There was absolutely no support, I might as well have not been wearing anything. The cup pad inserts that came with the bra were very awkwardly sized and very firmly molded. I am not sure if they were intended to hold and support or just provide some discretion to the article of clothing. Either way, they failed. They were too small to be of any help support-wise and too awkwardly stiff to be in any way discreet. I could probably insert cup pads from another bra that would be a better shape, but I don't know how they would end up looking inside the bandeau and I am not truly interested in trying.<br /><br />I probably need to order a size or two down and treat it like a sports bra, but for the time being this one just did not work out. The design is very cute and I really wish it could do something for me. Recommended for 34 Bs and smaller but otherwise, I recommend you pass on this one."
3.0,"Pretty dress.<br />Runs pretty small, so had to return it. :-("
3.0,"This top fits a little snug.  It is thicker material which I didn’t expect because i thought it would be a more “yoga” type breathable top.  I think that it is over-priced for what it is.  I gave it three stars because the material is thick, but a nice material if u want a thicker tank top."
3.0,"Nice little earring but they are almost impossible to get secured in the back.  I have had no other complaints about these earrings, they are exactly what I was looking for, small hoops for my top 3 earring holes.  I have had them in for over a week now and they have not tarnished or bothered my ears in anyway.  Just wish they were easier to get on."
3.0,"I really wanted to like these socks. There very soft and good looking. I got x-large and with a 13 1/2 inch foot they are small. To get the sock past my ankle I have to strech them like panty hose. If they were their only fault I could look past that but alas... My biggest complaint is they fall down as you walk around. After a couple hours I have to squeeze my fingers into my shoe and with two fingers pull them back up above my shoe. Really annoying. Also, after the first wear and subsequent launder they shrank some. See pic of before and after."
3.0,"They came as described, but don't hold in my shoes. The connector is a little too flimsy."
3.0,Looks better in pictures. Thin material. Bottoms look good although they don't reach belly button. Top provides zero support & band of material is narrow. Feels like breasts will fall out. I wear 36DD normally. Returning.
3.0,Love the look but the paint scratches off easy
3.0,Loved the outfit. Only issue was it’s big in size. So if purchase buy a size down from your size
3.0,I got the 0 8mm gauges and they’re super cute but don’t spin as well as I’d like. I’m gonna oil the wheels a little bit to see if they spin better but either way they are super cute but if your set on wanting them to spin really good then I’d only get them if you have a bigger gauge size
3.0,Too much lint and it sticks on to my coat and my winter coat looks like never washed because of this.
3.0,"Well made and very cute. However, if you have any boobs at all, this is not going to fit. Too bad because I loved the way it looked before I tried it on."
3.0,"Unfortunately like so many other bands I've purchased for the Samsung Gear S2, these bands do not come off easily. There's no point in having a watch band that you can't switch. I will have to toss it out. I would not recommend these bands."
3.0,"Thinner fabric than I expected.  Can't be worn alone, but fine as an underlayer."
3.0,"I bought this in a lightning deal. I like this purse, very spacious compared to what it looks like and has a good appearance to it. It didnt smell too horrible like what other reviews said but it did a little. It had fishy smell the moment i opened it, but after I kept it in sun for about 2 days the smell was gone. It also had a small stitch tear on one of the inside pockets. I gave three stars for that initial smell and that stitch tear."
3.0,"I purchased the khaki colored pants which were super cute, but they were very sheer. I am a true medium & a 6 in jeans, they fit great! I believe maybe black or a darker color would be 100% worth the money!"
3.0,Nice looking but you get what you pay for.  Do not expect it to last too long but it is priced at slightly above the cost of a watch battery.
3.0,"I should have gone to a pro to get this in because the rings are impossible to budge, but it wasn't easy with my schedule. Even so, the divots in the balls are so tiny I'm not sure how long they'd stay put anyway. Pretty, but maybe not a reliable prodoct."
3.0,Quality and design is good but I don’t know why they say large but it’s actually a medium
3.0,"This was such a cute swim suit but had to return it because it was way too small. I ordered a large hoping it would fit but it didn't. BTW, I am not a big girl what so ever but this swim suit runs way too little.  I was super sad to return it because it really is a super cute swim suit. It's well made but unless you are super petite, you won't fit into this cutie!!"
3.0,"Fit is weird but option not there for any specific way. Super long, arms are tight but it’s cute so making it work."
3.0,"The price was right for these pants and they fit my 9 year old fine. Just the right bunch at the ankle for a 54"" child, not tight on the waist (buy a belt for a slim child), room for growth and another season.<br />However, one muddy night game and the red staining will not come out of the material. Washed and soaked twice with Oxy and bleach."
3.0,"I liked this product, but a seam started coking apart dangerously which would have spilled everything tucked inside. Too bad! Returned!"
3.0,"Thick and long in length, but daughter didn’t like wearing them."
3.0,"The picture makes it look like it is enclosed in glass, but it isn't. So, it isn't exactly what I wanted, but I will make do with it for now. They were well received."
3.0,Have to iron it.
3.0,"Although they are pretty, they run super small. I am a size 4, ordered the MEDIUM but can tell by looking at it, that it runs very small. Really an XS"
3.0,I wish the photos had more photos of &#34;commonly&#34; used documents/cards/etc... So that I would have had a better understanding of how deep the pockets were. It will still work just fine though
3.0,Doesn't fit flowy as pictured.
3.0,Of the two pairs I received one arrived bent/misaligned such that they required 'surgery' in order to be of use.
3.0,"Very sexy and well made.  I am a 36C and ordered a large.  The band fit fine, but the cup was a little small.  It's so cute on that I can make it work though."
3.0,"Cons: this is an XXL, per size chart should for up to""40 waist.  WRONG. IT FITS UP TO 44"".  This was made for an 8' tall amazon woman.  The underskirt is not a full skirt,  it is only the very front that has the color fabric and ruffles.  The cape or train on the back and the ruffled panels along the front of the skirt are only tacked on, not completely sewn on.  The fabric is that of a typical fabric shower curtain.  The metallic ruffle trim is stiff.<br />PROs:  is as pictured,  it is pretty,  suitable for a costume (but not for something more serious).  Fast ship.  Once I put it on and clamped it to fit (all over), it felt lovely.  I do like it but will return it and get another custom ordered."
3.0,Became rusty quite quickly.
3.0,Liked print but fabric was too thin
3.0,"Ok, kinda itchy!"
3.0,"Let's be honest... the sweater doesn't look ANYTHING like the photos given on the product page. Clearly there were some design changes. For example, the sleeves do not have a few lines of giant chunky-holed diamonds... instead it's tiny diamonds and many many lines of them. The top doesn't have chunky knitted fabric but close-knit fabric. The wrist area isn't long as shown, but super short and stubby. Just these three things alone completely change the look of the top. There's also a design issue on the inside of the sleeves where it feels incredibly tight and weird taking it on and off (you can kind of see it pulling my chest down on the sides toward my armpits in my photo. With ALL that being said, it's still a comfortable and warm sweater and I'll still wear it!"
3.0,"I love the fabric, and will keep it as an easy thrown on for vacation, but the neck line is weird, you have to play with a while to figure it out. Honestly I still don’t know if I have it right? Oh well."
3.0,"Over the head dress, but nostretch in the fabric, making it exceptionally difficult to put on. No zipper, not enough ease in the waist for proper dressing."
3.0,"Material is very thin, see thru in the light."
3.0,"The camoflauge one is different from the other. Its much looser, the fabric feels thin and very stretchy. It does feel soft and silky. I dont think i will wear it many places but will be good for hanging out at home."
3.0,"So as I write this review I'm wearing this cardigan, for those of you who are considering ordering this cardigan, I'm here to tell you that IT'S NOT BROWN it's PURPLISH."
3.0,This bag is a little more gray than I thought it was but that's no a big deal. I purchased this bag because it fell into the dimensions of a personal item for a flight. I gave it three stars because the extra pouch that looks like it is meant to cover the main portion of the bag ripped at the seen.
3.0,"Garment is well made, but too big and sleeves too long. Material is a bit thin. Disappointed. Not able to wear it at Christmas."
3.0,"I love the material, the way it fits the only problem is the elastic waist band is in a regular waist band. It will not fit over my hips has to go over head. Tight. The way the band is made should of had a zipper ."
3.0,"The glasses are great.  I was just very disappointed when they arrived.  I ordered the purple glasses and the only part of the frame that is purple is the inside of the frame.  The outside of the frame, the part everyone else can see, is black."
3.0,"Thin fabric, color not as shown, but pretty just the same"
3.0,"This is NOT good for large breasts! I am telling you that while you will laugh a lot when you try it, you cannot wear this if you have large breasts.<br />My daughter has it and likes it."
3.0,Nice bra but fits way smaller around than described. I don’t even have big boobs. This will have to wait until I lose some weight.
3.0,It’s fine. A little cheaper looking than I thought. But still cute.
3.0,The frames seem sturdy & the look is amazing.  I really wanted to love these glasses but they did not do what they were advertised to do.
3.0,"This suit is very cute, good quality for the price & happy with the seller.  However the suit didn't work for me.  It just didn't fit properly.  I am 41 (had 3 kids), 5' 7&#34; & 150 lbs and wear a 34D bra.  This just didn't give the right support up top and seemed a little long for my torso.  The skirt was just right in front, however, it was too short in the back...I wanted a little more coverage.  I think it would work great for someone with a younger body.  I'm going to check out some of their other suits."
3.0,Runs small. My daughter is small for her age and it is more like a shirt on her. It is still adorable with leggings. Good material and super cute!!
3.0,Fit well gave 3 stars because mine was not the bright red seen in the pictures. It's more of a wine/mauve colour. Also bought in blue in the same size and the blue one fit much better
3.0,Not what I expected but it’s alright
3.0,"It’s nice, but not as big as I wanted it to be."
3.0,"I love these for my daughter’s tiny ears, but they started to tarnish after a few months. I was hoping that gold color would last longer."
3.0,"Fit good, but very thin."
3.0,its very large and completely sheer
3.0,"The shoe was light weight as expected, but one shoe was slightly smaller than the other. Which prevented the purpose of me buying a slip on shoe my toddler could slide on himself. It was a struggle for only ONE shoe."
3.0,Fit way too tight and wrinkles easily
3.0,The spokes came out to easy.  Did not get around to using as planned for a costume.
3.0,"I thought this dress would look a little fancier. It's made out of t-shirt type material, but I expected it to be shinier. Ordered it for the maid of honor for my daughter's wedding."
3.0,"I read  reviews about this shoe and I DID order a size  larger than I wear.  Nevertheless, these shoes are still too tight.  If I hadn't worn them to PT, I'd send them back for another size up."
3.0,The straps were too short to be a held over the shoulder.
3.0,Too tight on the bicep. Fits well everywhere else. The bicep should be able to expand more most especially when your arm is bent. It would be very annoying when playing golf. Needs to be modified in the bicep area for more comfort.
3.0,"Basic cap. Did NOT come with the sizing tape, but still fits OK."
3.0,"These will serve their purpose as key ring clips, but the clip and unclip process could be made smoother. I’ve used similar clips in the past which were smoother operating, but it will serve it purpose at a reasonable price"
3.0,"Overall a good product but nothing special. It was easily adjustable to be tighter around my ear with some pliers and seemed sturdy. The external threading was a bit rough in my opinion, but thats what you get when you use externally threaded jewelry.  Would recommend"
3.0,Four of the five pair of underwear are just what we expected. One pair ripped after one washing.
3.0,"I purchased this dress in pink. It is NOT the same color as in the picture. It is VERY loud and neon, bordering on the tacky side. The sizing is off. I purchased a large which is more like an XL or 1X. The fabric is very thick which is nice. It is also the same length and cut as pictured. I purchased it as a gift for my daughter to wear for her birthday dinner. I highly doubt that she will wear it."
3.0,"Warning:  this is sized for a child. Do not buy for an adult!  Otherwise, very nice, seemed good quality. Waste of my time and effort because they didn't mention this in the description."
3.0,"These gloves seem very well made; the fabric is nice and the touch-screen feature does work.  However, they are so ""puffy"" (due to the three layers, I assume) that I could not move my fingers much with them on.  I need gloves that provide better manual dexterity, so unfortunately had to return them.  Did not test them in cold weather or wet conditions."
3.0,I had to take the shirt to a tailor to get it adjusted. Fits way too big! And the color starts to dull after a few washes.
3.0,Let button broke in half as soon as I touched it lol returning is a hassle which is why I am keeping it but kinda disappointed
3.0,"they look great , decent price just a bit snug you might want to order one more  size larger to get a good fit"
3.0,"This is the stadium tote you want. I had a different, similarly designed bag, but the handle broke off after about five baseball games. Also, the strap on that wasn't padded and the plastic was thinner and cheaper. Liked this bag so much I bought one for a friend for her birthday. LOVE THIS BAG!<br /><br />After nearly a full baseball season last year and three months into (I go to around 30 each season) the current season, I'm here to update the use of this bag. Unfortunately, it has begun to crack and open in the bottom corners of the bag -- an issue if it rains, or if it ends up sitting in something wet. I've yet to find a bag that holds its shape, is comfortable to carry and is transparent. This bag is great, if you only plan on carrying it for a few months."
3.0,It has a strong smell. Looks good though
3.0,"10/2/17 Update: with my husbands stronger hands, he was able to get this band off more reliably. I still think they are hard to get off but I'm going to improve my rating because I can now get the band off the watch (at least tonight). It is too big for my wrist though. So if you have small wrists, I recommend going with another vendor that has a &#34;small&#34; option for size.<br /><br />The colors on this band are really nice but unfortunately, just like other brands that I've bought, they don't come off the watch. I've spent 20 minutes trying to get one of the bands of my watch with no luck. Now I don't know how to get it off without breaking the band and possibly the watch. I would avoid these bands. They took forever to get here and it's clear they aren't made to work effectively with the Samsung smartwatch. Disappointing. Oh and it's too big for my small wrist but that's a problem with all/most of the after market bands."
3.0,Perfectly described...amazingly duarable case
3.0,"It's not bad quality of fabric. However I'm 5'2, athletic/fitness body, 34D, and do not have have a long torso by any means and the length is too short it squishes your lady parts and it's so uncomfortable. Also the chest pads make your breasts look weird. Cute idea for a bathing suit but I wouldn't buy it from this maker again. I'd look for the same style somewhere else."
3.0,Look like new once again.  But do not use Dawn soap to clean them. It takes the color off.
3.0,"I bought this for my 9 year old son. The bookbag is durable but too heavy for a child. The platform keeps uplifting, you have to constantly push it down. The straps attached from the bookbag to the platform (to keep in place) keeps detaching.  An okay backpack,  but not for a child...to awkward and heavy with and without the roller platform."
3.0,"The dress is lovely & flown; however, the color is not the same as in the picture. The color I received is light pink. The belt was made too small and the inside skirt is way too short. I had to pay more money to fix the dress because I like the dress anyways."
3.0,Nice design but does not fit as expected no padding for the nose area so it will bother after a while
3.0,Veey beautiful but runs small and thr fabric has NO stretch to it.
3.0,My nephew loves the lights but they fit a little small need to get bigger size
3.0,Was made in Taiwan and I don't think it was made with cared.
3.0,"Very pretty, but made for the smallest most petite lady ever.  Must have super narrow rib cage & no boobs to wear this size small.  Too small for my 5'5 thin 14 year old daughter."
3.0,"I returned these.  The fit was okay, but the snake skin was a little old ladyish for me."
3.0,"Bigger than I expected, so I'll have to dig out the mulch to hide it."
3.0,"These were much smaller than I expected, gave them to my teenage daughter"
3.0,"I love this scarf but it is a pain in the neck (no pun intended). Firstly, it is not long enough to wrap around my neck properly. Second, it sheds. After I wear it, all my other clothes will be covered in white, stringy lint that resembles dog fur or something. (Yes, I have tried washing it to make the pilling stop but that did not help.) The scarf is so beautiful and versatile though, so I suffer through the lint for the sake of fashion."
3.0,It was big but I ordered it that way
3.0,It runs a bit on the larger side. Very light weight isn’t soft but it’s decent.
3.0,"A case of non-functioning cases.  The glasses come out with some protective plastic wrap and those very motivated static clinging labels.  Once removed the actual glasses are very light (almost delicate.). The fit was fine and clarity good as well.  However, when trying to slide them back into the case they reach a hard bind.<br />Trying to force it results in the frames bending, without the glasses on I can't see what is binding.  Lucky I have a two pack as I needed the second pair to put away the first.  You have to squeeze and wiggle with a bit of twist and they will go back inside.  I suspect that putting them away is what is going to both scratch and break them.  Now I need a third pair to put away the second."
3.0,"I ordered catseyes. What i got was plain gold balls. Other than  that issue, not much to complain about at this price point."
3.0,I really like the fit of this dress however it is really perfumed. I need to wash before wearing and hope the smell comes out.
3.0,"Would have been great if I ordered a size Up and the color was actually red. I needed it for a red and black affair, the shade was more of a burnt orange. I ordered a small because I wanted a fitted body with flair legs but it was too fitted"
3.0,Sweater would have received five stars if the zipper would have been installed correctly.  Very hard to engage zipper as is.  Not a happy customer.
3.0,"I ordered a white silver mask. What I received was a silver, silver mask. I am not complaining too much considering it is a very well made mask and it is very attractive. However I just wanted to let you know the item I received was an incorrect one. I do not want to spend the time or money returning it especially considering I need it ASAP and do not wish to wait for a new one to arrive. So I guess the best option for me is to be happy with what I received. Regardless getting the wrong item is an experience that make this seller lose points. Whatever mask you recieve will be a great mask just dont expect to get the correct one.<br />One more thing. The shipping was fast. Gotta give props to the seller for that."
3.0,The three stars are for fitment and price. Definitely not polarized as they claim.
3.0,Did not fit well!
3.0,"Like the earnings,would have bought another pair but the price went up."
3.0,Durag ties are not long so be prepared for that. Other than that great purchase. Caps are a bit weird shaped still fit nice.
3.0,"I really like the material these are made of. I got them with a discount coupon, so not going to bother with a return, but considering the price tag, they should have better workmanship. Having a hole in a seam from the beginning doesn’t give me much confidence in how long they will last."
3.0,1st the leash broke. Then the collar broke. Only use for show not for serious pl as y.
3.0,I like this backpack but 2 months of use and one of the zipper handles keep coming off. I don't know what they're called. It fits a 13' mackbook air perfectly. i tried to put a 1 inch binder and two textbooks in it and the zipper kept popping open. I would not buy again.
3.0,"very cheap material, runs larger than other chinese clothes online."
3.0,sized too small so buy the next size up
3.0,They were ok. I didn't like that the back part don't stay up as well as the front.
3.0,"It is tight and fits like a size 8 although the tag says it is a size 10. Also, the color is not at all like the color shown. The material is thick and it is some sort of a knit fabric."
3.0,Much longer than expected and just a tad too high waisted for my taste. Although very cute ;).
3.0,"The offer has 3 on the photo, I only got one. But it is a great product.  Thank you."
3.0,I loved how dark they are it’s exactly what I was hoping for. However they are way to small for me. The frame is small and around my ears it’s too tight. I had to give them to my 10year old. They fit her perfectly. My husband got the same brand but the polarized lenses and those fit me perfect so I thought these black ones would be the same. They aren’t.
3.0,"My shipment arrived on time; however, the font on the hats were extremely small."
3.0,"They are cute, but on the bigger side, that makes them heavy. Not for everyday use"
3.0,Shirt was way too short and small
3.0,Too small for a M. Amazing image though.
3.0,Pretty dress but way way to large.
3.0,"Hood is too puffy.  Although I bought 1 size up (large), the torso area is too short.  I use it often and don't notice any wear issues.  Glad to have a 23XI item but the fit is between poor and meh."
3.0,After only  3 washes a hole has appeared high in heel.
3.0,"Fit great and was cute the first time to wear. The top was itchy and coarse for 6 year old girl.<br />The bottom was cute until worn for awhile at the lake, the green color all rubbed off and is now black on the bottom, so it looks like its a dirty butt, but it is just no color. Tail was great, obviously can't swim with it on, so fun for laying around pool."
3.0,"I think the photo in the ad looks better than in person, and being a “men’s” watch, i expected it to be bigger, and easier to read. It serves its purpose."
3.0,"The quality of these is great and the designs are mesmerizing. I can't leave them in for more than a day or so, as the large front and back discs and overall snugness cause a lack of oxygen around the post--The Dreaded Piercing Smell hit very hard. They're okay with daily airing out."
3.0,Paid for 12 only received 11 bracelets. Other than that the bracelets are beautiful!
3.0,Wish there was a length option since I’m short. Want to keep it because it’s fun but the back has two spines and no scapulas due to the print/pattern being WAY off.
3.0,"Bought this in blue and black, both are shiny which I I wasn’t expecting. I was hoping to wear them with khaki but these are more formal."
3.0,It's a cute pattern and style just didn't work for me. It's a bit sheer for me.
3.0,Pretty cheap feeling. The color is screen printed...not actual that color fabric. Definitely size up.
3.0,the ring is missing a stone
3.0,"It’s really cute, but I got it for a friend who is a guy and it’s kind of small for his big face"
3.0,These masks have a tendency to self destruct with little to no human contact.
3.0,"Average quality, not perfect stitching"
3.0,Not loose around bottom part of leg kind of tight.
3.0,Comfortable but gives uniboob
3.0,"Smelled! Although decent quality for  the price, the item had a strong odor"
3.0,"great concept, flimsy though, break easy, i plan on 1 use."
3.0,Lower quality than expected but still worth the money.
3.0,"I thought this would be such a great gift but when it arrived, the entire package was open and the light was actually at the bottom of the box.  So disappointed."
3.0,"The description clearly says ""Stainless Steel and Black Leather Bracelet"". However, there is no leather in the image. Not sure what you would get if you ordered this."
3.0,"It was actually nice as far as the material and design, but as soon as the button popped off it was good for nothin lol (this item would be better if the button and the part it fastens to is more secure)."
3.0,"Definitely does not look like the picture. I ordered a small in the white (5'4&#34; 120 lbs) and I felt like it showed every curve just a bit too much. Also the lace is not a as nice looking as I had hoped, it looks like a dress you would find for $10 at Ross. I think a darker color may have looked nicer or more like I had hoped, but I had to return this one."
3.0,"I absolutely adore this bracelet's design but unfortunately it is very poorly made and gets out of shape very quickly to the point that the clasp stops working to secure it. I would love to see this design in a more high quality build, and would gladly pay more to get it. It's such a perfect representation of my spirituality!"
3.0,"These are ok water shoes. I wear any where between a 10 and a 12 depending on the brand of woman's shoe, and am comfortable in a 9.5 in mens and I do not know that I would consider these to fit well, but they work. I ordered and XL per the sizing offered on the page and I feel that my toes are alittle cramped. But, they stay on well even though my foot hangs over the edge of the sole. When it comes down to it, I'd rather wear them than not and the sides are stretch enough to accommodate but I wouldn't do any long walk on the beach with them."
3.0,It’s nice but it’s way too small on my 7 year old.
3.0,The shoes are really cute but I received shoes that were too big and I didn't get a chance to return them in time.
3.0,"Oh come on! The picture is so misleading! The image makes these gloves look shimmery and cool. The awful material is actually like some 1970's triple knit but thin polyester with no sheen whatsoever and they are very very cheaply made. They will work well however for a one or two costume uses or for a play? IDK,  So....not a real loss here - just beware of what you are ordering and keep those lowered expectations! They are useable."
3.0,Kinda expensive but fit watch. Was torn between just buying another watch or paying half as much for the band. Went with the band. Fit my twin sensor casio perfectly.
3.0,"I would say these were smaller than I was expecting. I had to give them away. These are not as stretchy as the jeans are. They’re very cute, just wish I’d ordered a bigger size"
3.0,"Very cute and I got alot of compliments. However , it run big , so I wear it with leggings ."
3.0,"Cute dress, love the pockets.<br />I'm 5'2"" 120 lb and size small is very loose fitting.  XS not available.<br />I've washed it twice and the material is starting to pill."
3.0,"I purchased these lightweight Sox for summer.  The material is great but with the sizes combined l-xl, I found these were not long enough for me.  I have purchased the regular weight in the xl and they work great.  Just wish the “lites” were longer.  I have tried other compression socks and some of them tend to cause creases after wearing all day and I have had no trouble with these."
3.0,Not as a bright blue as the picture and they do not fit snug into the frames.  They will work as a temporary fix but not exact. Maybe need to be a thicker lens.
3.0,The fabric kind of feels like that thin packing styrofoam people use at the post office. It fit but I can't imagine what it would be like after a wash. Returning.
3.0,good for yoga but fade seriou when washed.
3.0,Cheap products for a cheap  price
3.0,"It's pretty, shiny and looks nice. Unfortunately it feels cheap and I anticipate it bending soon."
3.0,"Right color, very big clasps"
3.0,Dropped once from toddler height and the red jewl popped right off. Luckily I had some gorilla glue laying around...
3.0,"Nice fabric, 3/4 sleeve"
3.0,"Very pixelated. The application associated with the mask is slow, if your patient you may discover"
3.0,So glad I went up in size with this dress. I’m pretty small in size… 4”11/Med…and the arms are barely at the length it needs to be. The dress itself fits comfortably and drags on the floor a bit but I prefer it that way than too short. Only issue are the arms not being stitched correctly and the fact that the neck part does not stay up
3.0,I am short and they are too long but because of the zipper I am able to cuff.  Very comfortable
3.0,the shirt was exactly as pictured and I really wanted it - but it was too small.  I would reorder if they had my size available in the color I chose.
3.0,Pretty thin and lame. It's worth the price though so I should have known how tiny it was gunna be. Can't get something for nothing.
3.0,"The material is nice quality, very flowy and not a loose gauze. The seams are even and well-finished, and the proportions are good - the arm holes are not too loose or tight. It would get five stars if the colors and design actually matched the photo. The blouse sent to me was a yellow color on the top and bkack along the bottom, with a blue butterfly on the side."
3.0,Im usually a small so that's what i order. It came sooner than expected and is very pretty but it's super small. I'm a small girl 34B. 5'4 and weigh 125 & this was way too small couldn't even buckle it in the back.. So if youre around my size go with a medium or large if you're bigger than me I don't recommend you to buy. I feel the small would work for a very small women thats a 32 A. Hope this helps! It's really beautiful tho😭
3.0,They have changed the fabric composition since last time I purchased.
3.0,"One of my bags wasn't blank, it had what I believe was Chinese writing not sure but the rest of the bags was what I expected."
3.0,Nice material and I love the pockets
3.0,Its teather not leather so after a while it will look torn up and fits a medium sized man i got it for my son whos a barber hes 5 ‘9 and it fits him small.
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the quality.  It is a beautiful watch.  But is was much larger than I expected.  If there had been a picture of it on someone's arm, I could have know it was bigger than I wanted. No problems with seller.  I have returned it."
3.0,"I wanted to like this dress. Other reviewers looked super cute in it. However, it was a little big everywhere - which might have been okay if the bust area was a little tighter and more fitted. For reference - I'm 5'6, 130lbs and 34DD. My waist is usually 28-29&#34; The bust area was huge and on both sides it gapped in front of the armpit area. The gaps were big enough that it looked like I had little wings protruding from the sides of my breasts.  A small probably would have fit better but the construction around the bust area was a little too sketchy for me."
3.0,"This shirt fits extremely awkward, not like the picture at all."
3.0,I’m not sure why but the skirt is way longer than expected. The red layer goes all the way down to my knees & it’s super ugly! I’m gonna try to fix it because other wise it’s super cute.
3.0,he seemed to like it<br />no problems with it
3.0,I would buy this in a size smaller than you usually wear.  It runs large.
3.0,If you want it baggy order a size or 2 up.....if you want it to cling to your body get the exact size.
3.0,Love this watch but battery was dead upon arrival.  I’m hoping with new battery it will work<br />5 stars for appearance and quality
3.0,"This was purchased about 6 months ago for my father, a dairy farmer, to carry every day in his pocket. You can no longer tell that this was a black finish. He often has coins, a pocket knife, bolts, screws, etc in his pocket at the same time, so this is probably the reason that the outside metals are now worn down to the underlying copper. On the plus side, he has never complained about it not keeping time. The battery now needs replaced, so the one that comes in it may not last more than 6 months. He does not care what it looks like, so if you go for function over appearance this may work for you."
3.0,Super thick for a nose piercing. It was so able but a tight fit. Caused a little redness. But it’s cute.
3.0,"Pro's: super lightweight, breathable, and the color is true to the pictures. And IT HAS ACTUAL POCKETS!<br />Con's: because it's so lightweight there is very little structure to it. I worry that after a single wash it will be really drab.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's priced too high for such a lightweight, unstructured ""blazer"" but the stretch is great, it comes in nice colors, and has actual pockets so the choice is yours. I bought two and decided to keep them. We'll see how they work out."
3.0,"I really wanted a white dress for summer and fell in love with this design. Read a few times, including product description, that this dress was not see through. That could not be further from the truth. I can see my belly button through this dress. I can see my white undergarments through this dress. I LOVE the design though. Size up or go by size chart. The M worked for me, which normally I'm a S or XS. Length is great, right about at knees. I am 5'7, 125#, 34a/b, 28, 35. I am returning this white sheer sheet of a dress and will try out the black. Wish me luck."
3.0,"The watch is nice but it resets the time all of the time. I think when the shirt sleeve hits the touch portion enough times, it resets. I like the watch but I cant count on the time. Cool novelty but unreliable time if it keeps resetting."
3.0,Very pretty but too big and the beads on the flowers twist.
3.0,Any kid clothes that can't be fully machine washed and dried is just mind-boggling to me. Most people don't have time for that nonsense.
3.0,"It fits comfortably and as expected width wise, but it is way shorter than I anticipated. I’m 5’10” so I wasn’t expecting it to drag on the floor like on the model, but it’s like 8 inches off the ground! Admittedly, some of that is due to me being 5 months pregnant, but even if I wasn’t, there’s no way this dress would be long enough by any means. Also, the way the pattern is, there is an awkward white patch right along the neck line that makes it look like I have an undershirt showing. I wish there would’ve been a different color there. I just tried it on so I’m debating whether or not I’m going to keep it."
3.0,It's not the fabric it said it was. It's nor stretchy at all. Size fit on the small side.
3.0,I bought dresses like this one before and the fit on the other ones was great. This one was an exception. The area around the armpits was a disaster. It was ill fitting.  I got a small. But it was too wide in the armholes. Also im 5 feet and this dress was too long for me unlike the previous 3 dresses i ordered.
3.0,"Good, but large"
3.0,"I think this model is a size 2 wearing a large. If you actually wear a large or xl, this is not a flattering fit. I ordered the xl and while I'm satisfied with the sleeve length, the quality of the material and the color - I look.like a frumpy school teacher in this cardigan :(<br />I'll probably return it if no one else wants it."
3.0,This was too small. The sleeves were too tight. I don't have big arms so that was a little weird. It was a little tight around the bust too but I couldn't even get the sleeves over my arms. Otherwise a nice dress. Very poofy around the waist though too. If you want a dress to make you look slim around the waist this is not for you.
3.0,Material was thin
3.0,Shorter than I wanted but nice soft material.
3.0,"These are a bit small, but nice for keeping in a handbag."
3.0,"Love how they feel, but too slippery to walk around in. Hard to keep on my feet. Nine year old grandson loved them, so cut the jewels off, and he wears them in the evening/night."
3.0,"This looks great in the picture because it is magnified. The real ring is much smaller so you can't really see all the detail if you look at it from a few feet away. The lion's teeth are very pointy and sharp. The ring got caught inside the sleeve of my shirt several times. I had to take it off before getting dressed. Ring is hollow and light, so you won't notice wearing it. I didn't keep it but you might like it just fine. It's very affordable so buying it is not a big risk. Seller is located in California, so they are easier to deal with than overseas merchants. Good Luck!"
3.0,Fun coat for a quick trip from So Cal to NYC.
3.0,"It’s ok made and fits as expected, but I don’t like the material , seems like it’s made from cheap sport t-shirt.  Not a great copy of a popular now style."
3.0,As far as the product goes. It is just what I need. Not as soft as indicated but a good product
3.0,That what you expect from china made
3.0,It was not flattering at all. Maybe because I'm short but it fit like a dress. It is comfortable.  It would be good with leggings. If you big busted I don't suggest buying this shirt.
3.0,cheap material but its good
3.0,Love the color (burgundy) and material. Gave it a three though because  I ordered up a size because I like cuddly bigger sweatshirts and it was not big. The bottom on the sweatshirt barely comes to my belt and I do not wear super low rise pants and do not have an extra long torso. There are also fuzz balls all over my house and I’ve washed it a couple times.
3.0,This may work for some but not for me. I don't like how you can see the clasps. Maybe if they were smaller they'd be more inconspicuous.  I also didn't like how the gold chain was way different than the gold sequins. The chain is more of a rose gold where the tank top sequins are yelloe gold.
3.0,way to big and boxy - color and fabric were fine
3.0,"It fits as expected and the design is really nice. Quality wise, it gets the little balls all over it in a single wash. I have ordered this type of hoddie before and it seems to be common with most of them. It is very light weight but works well with a shirt underneath. I would not recommend to order it to keep you warm."
3.0,Zipper on side uncomfortable
3.0,I like them but they are hard to put in my ears. One set was hard to close
3.0,Its a little shorter then I thought it would be.
3.0,"These shorts are exactly what I needed for my aerobics class!  They seem to be good quality, with nice secure seams.  The reason I did not give them a five star rating is because they arrived with vaginal secretions in the crotch.  Obviously they have been worn before?!?!?  I soaked them in the sink with detergent and the stains washed out easily.  I would not recommend this company because of this reason."
3.0,The band looks nice but gets twisted easily and won't stay flat.
3.0,"Great skirt and great buy for the price. However, it is quite see through. Fabric is nice too."
3.0,Buy it if you want shreks stinky dna written on you.
3.0,"Very tight on wrist, like having a rubberband on your wrist."
3.0,I'm giving 3 stars because I just start to using .Right now  fits as I expected .I will update later
3.0,"I bought the petite version, one size larger than I normally wear per suggestions from other reviews. I would say order up not just one, but two sizes on this one unless you want the jacket to be very tight. I do like it, although the hood isn't detachable and gets in my way sometimes. The only other down size to the jacket are the sleeves. Like I said, I ordered the petite and the sleeves are still too long by a few inches for me and I'm 5'3''. Purchase with caution!"
3.0,"The colors aren't as vibrant as I like, but I like that it's a little narrower than most of my Murano beads.....changes the look of my bracelet."
3.0,It's great it's my daughter's favorite but the zipper pull fell off after about 2-3 weeks of wear
3.0,"I like this Tee...just feel that the price did not match the fit that's why I gave it 3 stars.... the Tee looks, feels, and fits nice."
3.0,"5'2&#34; 130 lbs 34B ordered small. As usual, it's a little long but I expect that with my height. The top will flatten your boobs out, so unless you're packing implants, this might not be flattering. Maybe a larger size would be less constricting? It's a beautiful dress, just not for my body type."
3.0,Runs small! I’m a normal medium should have ordered a large
3.0,"Product fit is true to size. Arrived rolled in a ball and severely wrinkled. Shades of blue/green/peach are darker on the garment than in the photo. For me that is okay. Fabric is 100% and is recommended to be dry cleaned or hand washed. Definitely not worth $60 that I paid, probably $40 at the very most. I’m 5’5” and the length is just right as it is right at the floor, no extra fabric to trip over."
3.0,Would be 5 stars if they did not have a seam along the front of the toes.
3.0,I like it but a little bit bigger regular large size
3.0,"The sizing is ""Lg Adult"" but it does not fit my upper arm and fits tightly on the lower arm.  They are pretty though."
3.0,This is an ok buy. When you're looking at it. I'm a chunky girl so I thought the XL would fit. Hell no. It won't fit at all. It's like a freaking small or medium.
3.0,"my 3y/o loved it for valentines day, even though it was a little big and arrived with a black stain on it :/"
3.0,Accepted
3.0,“Easy on” isn’t true. No easier to put on than any other compression socks.
3.0,Cute and neutral color
3.0,I thought this was so cute. The material of the top wasn’t that great in my opinion and it runs pretty big.
3.0,"The picture was funny, but the mask was difficult to breathe through."
3.0,I was a little disappointed with this hoody and I did end up sending it back. The fleece was surprisingly lightweight and a bit flimsy feeling for the price paid. I liked that it zipped up all the way under my chin and the hood has good coverage but unfortunately a little lighter than what I was expecting.
3.0,"The length is shorter than the average crop top, and a bit shorter than pictured. Nice, thick fabric."
3.0,It is too heavy.  I expect it to be thinner and softer.  I tried to put it with my swimming suit for the beach.
3.0,It broke too easily; would like it replaced for free
3.0,I thought it would have been made with a heavier material for the price.
3.0,SUDDEN allergies prevent any kind of metal wear. Painful blistering and ache. Trying these out. So far just waiting to heal after repiercing parts that had closed.<br />Smaller than I had thought. Must be for children not an adult.
3.0,Some detail was lost..in the design..
3.0,"The metal is easily bendable, lightweight, and non-magnetic (though the last is not necessarily a bad thing). The flutes are only detailed on the front, the back is completely flat and has the words &#34;China&#34; and &#34;Future Primitive &#34; molded into it.<br />If anyone has purchased the necklace version of this I'd like to hear about it, is it just one flute and chain instead of two flutes.<br /><br />The only good thing was the detail of the flutes, the keys were also well printed on the foot joint as well. I find the detail (for something this size) pretty amazing, it earned this one more star then what I would have given it, compared to those other ones where they have a bunch of glass gems and oversize keys."
3.0,Love how light it is and the look love the wood and stainless band.  BUT says it’s a chronograph lol but the buttons are useless only thing that works is the clock hands not sure about the date as of yet I’m giving it 3 stars just on looks and the weight would’ve gave it 4 or 5 if the description said the chronograph was just for looks this is my 3rd watch from them not sure I’ll purchase another one cause of the misleading info about the watch but keeps accurate time so far
3.0,The charm itself is pretty but the chain is simple. I like the 7.5 inch bracket is much prettier it's just to small.
3.0,Cute dress but fit wasn’t right. Small was still too big.
3.0,"This is really a great costume and I was a hit in our neighborhood on Halloween, but it really was a little small base on the description. All-in-all I was still pleased with the purchase."
3.0,"So I bought this for my guy right, too girly for some reason anyway I stole it so I'm loving it"
3.0,Hat is too small
3.0,"The design is fantastic... I got it for my wife for Mother's Day. Unfortunately it didn't last 3 weeks, and was used seldom. The stitching was poor and fell apart. Get what you pay for? I don't know."
3.0,I absolutely love this bathing suit. And it fits absolutely beautifully. But after 2nd day wearing there's rust on the top. Very sad because it's a beautiful suit
3.0,Came in late but I guess the material is okay
3.0,"Liked, reordered smaller size"
3.0,"The jacket fit well, however there is an issue with the zipper. It's hard to get to zip correctly, you have to work at it. Other than my grandson likes it."
3.0,"Most things about this dress I love. I live the style, and the fit. I am 5'4, 34DDD and a size 5/6 waist. The medium for great. Not too tight in the bust, and not too loose on the belly. In fact I have a little room all over, but not too much. The price was definitely right.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the dress, which has me considering returning it, is that he material is kind of shiny, kind of like what your sexy (insert character here) Halloween outfit would be made of. It is a pretty cheap material. I'm trying to figure out if I can get away with it because it's black and less noticeable. Which should say how bad the material is, if I loved the dress but am not sure if I should keep based solely on the fabric."
3.0,Very comfortable ...just what you want when you get in between your  sheets!!
3.0,"The quality of the flannel looks good. The size is completely incorrect. Even the USA conversion is wrong. I am a size 14 in EVERYTHING I wear. This shirt says 6XL and it is supposed to fit size 14. NOT EVEN CLOSE. It is tiny. It is also not as long as it looks in the photo. I would have scored it 1 star for size, but the quality is good. Great shirt for a tiny person."
3.0,"The waist was pretty much a good fit, but the pants were too long.  Hemming might be a problem due to the zipper."
3.0,"These goggles look pretty fun and steampunk, which is why I bought them, but found them to be cheaply made. These are built for style and not function. Still, I found the padding around the sides to be asymmetrical and poorly put together. Should a person be looking for purposeful goggles I would definitely avoid these as they are useless. They could do okay for a steampunk costume, but they're likely to disappoint."
3.0,Its nice if you skinny not for curves
3.0,i love the idea and it worked so well but after a couple months the clock just stopped.
3.0,It’s not bad if you need a little ring. Maybe something to wear at work or vacation this works well
3.0,Started peeling after about 6 months
3.0,"I thought the pattern and fabric was as it appeared: arms fitted, colors vibrant!"
3.0,"El disfras está bien echo , solo que pedí talla M y si es  más grande queda ah un L la  máscara se esta muy flaca , se ve bien para afuera tiene un aroma ah plástico  puedes respirar  bien  no ahy queja,  pero es mejor buscar  otro grinsh ay más bonitos 😅 este de la cara se ve muy delgado y el pelo no es muy parecido,."
3.0,"This was smaller than expected. It fits in my head, but it's not slouch like I'd hoped. Seems like it is sized more for a child."
3.0,"Not as good as exspected, but does work"
3.0,"Was a bit small, if it fit better would have been what I was looking for."
3.0,"The socks no longer fit my husband after washing and drying, but I wear them and like them."
3.0,Nice charm but the clip lock won’t stay on charm bracelet.
3.0,"The band of the bracelet does not stretch, limiting the size to fit most wrists."
3.0,"I wanted to love this shirt! It's shorter in person than expected, felt a bit too bulky at the waist, and the boob area was both tight and loose at the same time. Just didn't work for me, sadly."
3.0,I like tunics but this is much longer than expected. I'm still not sure what to pair it with as it looks weird with every pair of pants that I own. Some cropped leggings might look ok. Quality is good and the design is pretty.
3.0,"I like how they looked, even if they did feel like they would break on day two because of the poor construction of the frames.<br /><br />What I didn’t like or appreciate was them telling me not to remove the lenses to see if your lenses fit, which I did anyways.<br /><br />I especially didn’t like that my lenses didn’t fit the frames so the size is likely off."
3.0,They catch the light very nicely and the gold setting adds an added warmth.I would have bought a bigger pair.
3.0,The neckline stretched out after just a few washings and made it so that I constantly had to adjust it when I wore it. Love the color though.
3.0,"Would have given this dress a higher rating, but the fabric seam at the base of the zipper ripped and created a hole. I was too embarrassed because it happened while at church. Luckily I camouflaged it a little until church ended. The colour is pretty and the fabric was decent for the price."
3.0,"When I got this I loved the way it looked, however it sits directly on my nose bridge and fogs up my glasses.  Also when I breathe I’m...it comes directly into my mouth.  I need something else that I can breathe in as this is to hot for a nose breather.  It is pretty though.  Just not practical for me"
3.0,these are cool but they’re not as good as the actual croc ones. they pop off soo easily you won’t even know they’re missing
3.0,"I bought this ring because  it was nice and colorful, and looked like it would look nice in the summer when I wanted something bright. The ring arrived and I was not super excited by it. It is a nice enough costume ring, but not exactly what I expected. Most of the stones were like they were in the picture, except for the two pink stones near the middle. While they looked like a deep pink online, in real life the stones are a light pink and kind of dull, unlike the other stones. The presence of these light stones makes it look like it is made for someone  much younger. The stones are also not in a setting, they are glued on the ring so they are likely to fall off.<br /><br />With this all being said, I think the ring would be nice for a young  girl or woman. I don't necessarily dislike it, it is just not for me. The ring itself seems well made and sturdy, even if the stones don't look terribly secure.<br /><br />I received this ring at a discount in return for an honest product review. The above opinion is based on my use of the product."
3.0,"the skeleton top was cotton and fit kind of tight, but the mermaid print was polyester and fits better."
3.0,They were smaller and narrower than we expected so had to send them back
3.0,"Cute watch, but band is stiff and awkward."
3.0,I haven't wore it yet. The picture of the dress looks better than the dress in person. Maybe I'll like it more when I decide to wear it.
3.0,The quality is okay. It's a bit see through. But still over all cute on.
3.0,Fits more like an oversize shirt. Not a sweat shirt.
3.0,This jacket has an excellent fit but the fabric does not breathe.
3.0,"It's cute, but it is waaaaay too large width wise, but shorter length wise. It will be a comfy sleep shirt!"
3.0,"I liked the design, material and length. However the fit was too small. I had ordered another skort from the same company in medium and it fits great. I therefore ordered this one in a medium and same design but different color. I had to wait longer for the delivery as well. I was disappointed when it did not fit. My girlfriend was happy as it fit her."
3.0,looked and felt used. the lenses were slightly scratched. they’re “ok” for what i paid for.
3.0,For people with small heads it may slip off easily.
3.0,the bars are cute only problem i had was that they caused my ear to hurt so bad because the material that they are made from is obviously cheap next thing they are hard to go into my ear
3.0,"First of all, the size is true.  We ordered a bit large for shrinkage (due to being made out of cotton), but they didn't shrink at all.  Out of the three different colors, the light blue is the most comfortable.  The fabric does seem to be all cotton, is comfortable and has held up well.  The white one is a disaster.  Somehow it got some stains on it while my husband worked outside, and they won't come out.....even with bleach! It isn't wearable anymore except as an outdoor work shirt (mowing lawn etc.).  The grey one is ok, but is hot and seems to have some synthetic fibers?  I'm not sure, but he only wears that one inside in A/C. As many XL shirts, they just aren't long enough.  They are wide & short.  In hindsight, we should have ordered the Large as my husband usually wears.  I think you get just about what you paid for with this tank trio."
3.0,The earrings were OK for the cheap price but the shipping charges were high. The earrings looked very nice and had screw on backs which were nice. The only issue was that the stones were very loose in the setting. Otherwise they were nice for the money.
3.0,Dislike the way to large fit. Size down smaller than normal size. Ordered medium but need small.
3.0,I haven't tried them yet but for the price I was expecting something a bit more sophisticated. Will update once I wear them.
3.0,Missing stones but decided to keep anyway.
3.0,"I have 3 of these high low shirts from the same manufacturer. All three fit different. The red is not as long in the front as my other two. A little disappointed in the fit of this one but can still make it work. The gray fits true, the patterned one fits larger and the red fits a hair snug."
3.0,The stems are not long enough.  They fall off too easily. Good quality though.
3.0,I ordered this belt for my 10 year old son and it is GINORMOUS!!!<br />Definitely more of a men’s size belt but it is very well made and he loves the design so I’ll try to cut it and burn the edges slightly so it doesn’t fringe on him
3.0,It's OK alittle expensive for what I got.
3.0,"Cons: The photo is misleading, it's a lot longer than what's shown. I'm 5'4&#34; and the length goes down mid calf (I personally like long dresses, but the photo should be more accurate :p)<br />Fabric feels delicate, can snag easily by an excited kid or pet.<br />Overall it's a little big. I'm in between a medium and large, this is more like a large, but the style seems to work if you're a size 10, 12, maybe 14?<br /><br />Pros: Beautiful pattern and colors, comfortable, very feminine and flowy,<br />I hate dresses that make me look like a sausage, lol, this one doesnt. The price is a definite plus."
3.0,"I liked the look and style of this top but like other shipped from China tops I found multiple sellers on amazon with the same exact picture but different prices.  So I ordered this one and one that was almost twice the price called Kangaroo Pockets Loose Hoodies Sweatshirts Outerwear Coat Dress 29.99 for gray one.  I wanted to see if I would be sent the same top or not (Because the model and picture are the exact same.)  I found that they were NOT the same however almost identical in every way except the length, and the hood.  This one fits shorter in the front hitting at about my upper thighs having more of a sweat shirt look at least in the front and the other one I ordered was almost like a dress hitting just above my knees.  The hood was also a bit different this one being more like a cape hood and the other just extra fabric around the neck.  At the end I decided I actually liked the longer length one to keep and I will be returning this one.  Thought there would be others searching and wondering the same thing as me, so go by reviewers photos and not the model.  Also I would say the top fits true to size if you are going for a baggier look, or a tad bit on the big size if you like it more fitted."
3.0,Stitching poor quality but nice style
3.0,Fits good but it doesn't look anything like the picture
3.0,I ordered  this with the high waisted matching pants. I like the shirt but they do not match at all. The shirt is more of a sherbert and the pants are a highlighter orange. I cant wear this as a set as pictured.  So disappointed.
3.0,"I have a metal allergy that prevents me from being able to wear any earrings without getting red, irritated ear holes. I hoped these would help. They fit snugly on the earring post, but I can't get them to go all the way through my ear holes. Guess I won't be wearing earrings. Otherwise, they seem good."
3.0,"It is just the size I wanted. The problem I have with it is if you take something out, your cards fall out. There should be a way to make sure they are secured in place or why bother with the RFID if they fall out and give someone a chance to find your cards once they fall out and you lose them."
3.0,Beautiful watch but doesn’t stay wound up best to Purchase a higher end watch like a Tag or Omega
3.0,They wrinkle when he puts them on.
3.0,Thin but my son wants to keep them!
3.0,"The picture is not how the pin looks. It's very shiny with no etchings. It's okay Ioved the show and so I still like the button. I would have liked it more if it looked like it was pictured. At this point I'm not sure why amazon has allowed them to continue selling this without displaying the correct image, but I suppose it is what it is."
3.0,Could be cute but fits about 2 sizes too small
3.0,Runs small would definitely get a size up
3.0,The print on the aviators are too prominent that it's distracting to see through.  I guess if you have the luxury of taking of a fall then use the aviators...but I wouldn't use it for hiking or some treacherous activity where you need a full unobstructed view.
3.0,"This is a nice dress and fits well. Mine came as a returned item though. I mean, it came in the previous purchasers bag and return slip and taped like they were smuggling drugs."
3.0,"I love the color and comfort, but this hoodie already is leaving little fuzzies on whatever shirt I am wearing underneath it.  Also, I saw this same exact hoodie at a retail store in the Junior's department after buying.  Therefore, it might need to be marketed that way to set up expectations for quality and fit."
3.0,"The spandex, though only 5%, makes this shirt fit like a wet suit.  I love the colors, but the models in pictures must have a 26 inch waist to make the shirt appear ""loose"" around the bottom.  While clingy, the shirt does expand (and tightly contract) with each movement of your body."
3.0,Pretty but small!  Seem more appropriate for a younger girl or someone with petite ears.  Price was right so I'll keep to give as a gift.
3.0,These are ALL SILVER. They do NOT have black hi lights like in the picture
3.0,"I really liked the look of these sunglasses that are right on trend and polarized.<br /><br />These glasses really looked good and are super light weight.  I love the blue colored lenses!!  They came with a bag to protect them when not wearing them and a little screwdriver to adjust the ear pieces if needed.  There was even a little tag included that shows a picture when you are wearing the glasses to demonstrate the polarization.  Cute.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the ear pieces was stuck and was hard to move.  It never would open fully.  I tried using the screw driver to loosen it up but the screw seemed to be glued or stuck and there was just no getting that piece to open fully as you can see in the second picture.  So, that made for a bit of a struggle to start.<br /><br />Then, when I put them on, of course, they were cockeyed because of the ear piece and then I guess that caused the nose pieces to fit improperly.  They seemed to make the glasses stand up high on my nose and just not feel good, so I tweaked them a bit to bring the glasses down to a more normal feel on the nose at which point they had a sharp edge that just hit my nose wrong and I could never get that ear piece to loosen up or straighten out.<br /><br />All in all, these glasses just did not work for me which is sad because I really liked the look of them.<br /><br />Cannot recommend."
3.0,"I'm normally a large and after reading the reviews I bought the extra large. Even with a short torso it was still too small. Ended up giving it to my sister in law, it fit her perfectly. I would order an XXL but i'm still skeptical about the sizing. Other than the sizing the product seems well made and i have no other issues with it.<br />For reference i am 5ft 1 and approx 170lbs"
3.0,Arrived with poor stitching leaving a hole in the crotch
3.0,The material is very flimsy - not heavy like it looks online.
3.0,Top is very short in length. Returned.
3.0,Served its purpose but was very small.
3.0,"Blouse is ok...as expected material is not great, a bit cheap. I bought a small, and it fit like a medium large...so size down when ordering"
3.0,"This mask runs small but that works great for my smaller face. The material is rough but thick enough. Stitching isn't great, there are areas where the stitches veer off into the mask.  Somewhat contoured but no nose piece to bend to form. Would not purchase again."
3.0,it’s very long. But cute.
3.0,"This gator has thin material and fits tightly.  I am average size at 6'1"", 230lbs."
3.0,I like the fact that you can wear it around your neck and not have it hanging off your ears.<br />I don't like that it is pretty tight for me.  I wear an XL size hat ot helmet.  It squishes my nose and is hard to breathe through.
3.0,Was super excited about these. They are super soft but definitely run small! I got the plus and they are not something I’d wear out in public. I’m a size 12 and they are snug not uncomfortably so but if I bend over or squat they are a bit see through on my bottom.
3.0,"Quality isn't the best, but for the price is very acceptable.<br />Runs a bit big, still is nice. The patting for the boobs are all the place, aren't secure anywhere and you have to kind of pull it up to be in place."
3.0,"i liked this dress, cut was a little strange but okay and i love the pattern (I'm a sucker for moons and stars) good for work however after wearing it 2 or 3 times i've noticed that there is wear diagonally across the chest and i was trying to figure out what it was until it hit me-the seatbelt.  the seatbelt in the car caused a noticeable wear pattern after 2-3 times being in the car with the dress on so the fabric is very delicate and will not stand up to much use- you might get a longer use out of it if you wear something over it so it doesn't get ruined.  I will wear it with a suit jacket from now on which should hide the worst of it."
3.0,I was so excited about these bc my kids both have problems with their feet on the pool floor rubbing them raw. Unfortunately on the first day we wore them to the pool both pair got holes in the big toe by the end of the day .... was definitely hoping for longer wear time
3.0,Seemed to be a little feminine in mine and my girlfriends opinion but they’ll do the job and that’s all that matters.
3.0,"I am 5' 7 1/2'', 125 pounds. I ordered a medium. Although it fits as expected, around the waist and bust, it's ridiculously short and looks silly even with flat sandals."
3.0,Heavy. Hard to breathe
3.0,"This scarf is vibrantly colored and oh so soft, BUT, it started to unravel the first day I wore it. That was disappointing, for sure. I love the scarf. I just wish it didn't unravel as I'm wearing it!"
3.0,There's this blue balllike thing on all of them and is really obvious. I don't like it.
3.0,"I love this bathing suit but... the top has no support or padding at all. I wear another strapless top under it to add a little support and coverage. Overall though, I love the fit and the fact that's a little baggy. The bottom part has good coverage and is super cute."
3.0,"On the package it says they are easy to put on. Not so. The ankle and calf is too small. The ankle is where swelling occurs, and that’s why I needed the socks- to keep the swelling down. It’s not enough to suggest they should be put on in the morning before the leg swells.  That’s true, but they just are too small to make them easy to put on."
3.0,It fades
3.0,"It was very small could fit a small child, does not look like the picture"
3.0,Specially around the waist it was very loose
3.0,This shirt is pretty but it was see through and too small for me ):
3.0,Very cute but an XL is a Small very tiny and tight
3.0,"This item is ingenious. When worn under a samue or yukata, it looks very nice. A substantial and relative fancy, stiff  ""eri"" (collar) is fitted to an ordinary t-shirt of plain white jersey material (think ""Fruit of the Loom"" t-shirt). In fact, I think it would be better if the body of the shirt were made of traditional summer underwear cloth -- sarcenet -- which is less ""clammy"" against the skin. The largest size is Japanese XL. I wear Japanese 3L. So points off for limited options."
3.0,"Color but too long, kind of thin"
3.0,Length good but size is smaller for its size.  Not enough flair.
3.0,I think it should be for a woman to small for man not to happy buy it is nice.
3.0,"The material in pretty thin, I have washed it and it is still itches my skin"
3.0,"The hat size was larger than described, which is somewhat disappointing. Means I will need to alter hat band to make it wearable."
3.0,"Stylish, moderate light protection. I have a somewhat large head, so they are not comfortable"
3.0,Arrived in timely fashion...decent design and textile
3.0,Would have been good if I had received all 10 but I received 9. I'm guessing whoever bagged my order can't count or got distracted. Colors are cool though. Haven't used them so not sure of durability.
3.0,the lens are very hard to see on the gold ones.  I do not recommend this purchase.
3.0,"This dress is a pretty jade color (true to photos) and is actually lined with almost a fleece, which should make it very warm and cozy for winter. But because of the Lycra material, it clings to EVERY roll! I’m going have to wear a body shaper — and probably lose a few lbs — to wear it and feel comfortable. For $12.99 I don’t think it’s worth exchanging, but I wish I’d ordered a medium.<br />I’m 5’4, 126lbs and got the small. I’m also 44 so am starting to have the loose skin issues around the bra line in the back, which is less than flattering in this dress."
3.0,"Ordered royal blue and it is not even close to the color in the photo. The fit is good, some of the stitching is pretty iffy though."
3.0,"I typically wear a size 8 (5’0”, 125 lbs), but I’ve got chicken legs, so I sized down to a 6 since they’re stretchy. They fit perfectly in the waist, but I had to take in the legs by about 2 inches and hemmed them (I bought the short length) by about 3 inches to make them ankle length on me. I love them now, but it’s a pain in the butt having to alter even skinny jeans. I guess that’s a me problem though."
3.0,Unable to use for the purpose it was purchased as the delivery was tardy  :(
3.0,I bought this for myself and had to give it to my teenager because it was to small. 3x fit more like a large and the hoodie is thin.
3.0,"It’s hard to rate the size of this item. It’s is longer than I anticipated, so I have to wear it with extra tall high heels. However, it did tug at my midsection a bit. It’s not as flowy as I had hoped. It touches my “mom belly” when I wear it. However, it is still very pretty and I love the style of it. I will keep it despite these few unexpected fit issues."
3.0,Did not like side pocket.
3.0,"The pendant is very beautiful. Unfortunately, the chain broke one month later and I had to replace it with one of my old ones."
3.0,"Well, the bag is heavy, has no compartments inside... I am not impressed and hardly use it. It looks OK when full."
3.0,"seems disposable, lightweigth materials"
3.0,Very comfortable. The “logo” is a cheap iron on instead of embroidered.
3.0,It's okay.  Doesn't really seem like a bathing suit and the so called headband is just a bow with no clip or way to attach it to your baby's head.
3.0,Don’t like the super wide neck
3.0,It breaks very easy
3.0,"Very pretty bag! Nice dual color tone. Decorative hardware is cheap junk. Kept coming apart. I finally gave up trying to keep it all together. Interior compartments have some shoddy sewing, ie unfinished edge."
3.0,"I picked this up for my mom who needed some new clothes after losing a lot of weight last year.<br /><br />This shawl looked exactly like her style but when it showed up they were a couple things off about it.<br /><br />For one the cut is a bit weird, this isn't just a simple throwover. I'd compare getting this thing to look right to unraveling a tangled cable.<br /><br />Second, in person the material looks more like a cheap hoodie than a dressy shawl.<br /><br />Overall it's ok, but not great."
3.0,"I have pretty hairy arms, and this band is constantly pulling them, which is quite painful. On top of that, the magnets are quite strong, which is supposed to help the band stay tight, but it also makes it hard to adjust and get the tightness just right."
3.0,"Checked the size chart before ordering, and the size I ordered matched my measurements.  It is very small and because it is a robe I can get it across my body, but it is not flattering.  Would order a size or two up next time.  The tag on it said it was a US size 8, and I wear a 12.  It was a large on the tag, but said that was a US size 8."
3.0,"I'm 6'2, 240 and the XXXL was tight on my shoulders. Holding it up to my wife's wetsuit, or my friends XL ScubaPro it is clearly shorter.<br />Also, after less than 40 dives it has already started to tear at the base of the zipper, I imagine i don't have many more dives on before it breaks completely. The glow in the dark is a nice gimmick but didn't last very long and most of it gets covered by gear anyway."
3.0,Supposed to be a dress however it fit like a top.
3.0,"Not bad, but kinda flimsy. Very light-weight, but not the best design(as far as the clasp)"
3.0,They are okay.  Don't look as nice as the picture and they are huge!!!
3.0,"This Sun Hat is not terrible at all, but I ordered multiple brands from Amazon to test out the look and feel and the Sun Hat's made by a company on Amazon that begins with a ""Cam....."" are simply superior and cost around the same price so I took these back and stuck with the other brand."
3.0,"Kind of annoyed that the color is more of an off-white/cream, not bright white. Seems to run a little small and the material isn’t what I expected, it’s that snug tight type of polyester and spandex, not cotton. Otherwise it works for what I wanted, wearing it under a suit."
3.0,Bottles were too big and saggy.
3.0,Deep sleeves
3.0,Kind of big.
3.0,"I am 5""2ish and 140lbs, I got a medium and it's a bit big in the waist and hip area.  The pockets make the garment look even bigger on.  Unfortunately it wasn't for me so I had to return it."
3.0,It’s cute but it has a REALLY strong smell.
3.0,I ordered a large. It fits a little “boxy” I feel that it’s short and wide.
3.0,Even after reading several other customers say how weak these earrings are I still purchased them. I wore them not even a week and they completely broke. The stud broke apart from the earring back and it wasn’t even salvageable. I would not recommend these at all. They’re lightweight but not at all sturdy.
3.0,"One of the pair of glasses has a flaw in the center of the lens.  With the distortion directly in my line of sight, it made the glasses very difficult to wear.  The other pair work very well and I use them everyday."
3.0,The swimsuit fits and is super cute but the lining isnt great.<br />The lining comes outside of the swimsuit and its white - you keep having to tuck it under
3.0,"They are really cute, but after a few hrs they hurt ur toung ...  They like cut the sides of ur toung .."
3.0,"The quality of the tutu is really good. Nice materials,  very flowy, yet the right amount of &#34;poof&#34;. Had i been trying to purchase this for my Adult Size 6 daughter, this product would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />Unfortunately,  I was buying it for me. Couldn't get the XXL past my upper knees. Measure, measure, MEASURE  before you buy.<br /><br />Btw, my daughter loves it and is planning to wear it for &#34;spirit week&#34;. I'll update with pictures soon."
3.0,"for the price it was fine, fell apart after about 6 months"
3.0,Too small and the fabric was not stretchy
3.0,"They were comfortable and relatively breathable. They were a little too big at first but then shrunk when I washed them so now they fit better. My biggest disappointment was that the description stated that they had adjustable nose pieces but they actually don't. For the price though, they are okay."
3.0,Earrings look great BUT I expected them to be more the size of a quarter but they’re only dime<br />size & too small to be noticed!
3.0,While I love the print it is much too large. The top is also semi see through even though it’s too big. I’m undecided whether I’ll try to add a belt or return product. If you are a petite female this isn’t the dress for you. (My review says I ordered a medium I definitely ordered a small.)
3.0,Cute but pearl fell off on day 2
3.0,fits as expected. stretchy material.
3.0,"ravels, pockets not strong"
3.0,"Close to the original, but no cigar."
3.0,Great for its price......made cheapy
3.0,The bracelet is really pretty but super small with picture and infinity charm....can barely see what picture is
3.0,Unraveled fast
3.0,"Was just the right size and shape I wanted for my medications and supplements, but within a few days one of the straps started to rip where it was sewn to the bag."
3.0,I love the look; they're sleek. They are a tad heavy. But getting the latch in place is awful and that's why I've given this a 3 star.
3.0,"Very pretty and similar to the picture, though a little darker yellow than I'd expected--it's just lighting on the picture, though.  You can tell it's the same product as advertised.  The length is nice, though I'm about 5'9, so for some people it might run a bit long, but it's not difficult to adjust if need be.<br /><br />It's cheap, sure, but it looks like I paid maybe $12 for it, which is more than I did.  Only big issue is that it turns the skin it touches for the day s really murky green.  Might show up a different colour on people less pale than me, but if you don't mind the murky green (or your skin doesn't react to this sort of thing) then I highly recommend it."
3.0,"I read the reviews; they were right the dress was plane & see through, so I decided to give it a boost & add my own alterations. I purchased fabric & accessories & added it to the original dress."
3.0,"These pants are gorgeous but I was disappointed as I am a short waisted girl and 5' 2 "" ..just to high waisted and long in the legs for my liking. Fabric is lovely and they seemed very well made."
3.0,Liked but not so lifting as sold . Just like any underwear
3.0,"It runs a bit smaller so I would go a size up. The dress is cute but the tie part, too much material looked awkward and not flattering especially if you have curves. I tried to get creative because the print and dress was really cute but just didn't work.... if the tie part was longer would had wrapped it around and back  and to the front instead for a small knot in the front but not longer enough. Returned it!"
3.0,The first few times the product was really good but the last time I ordered it had a lot of clumps.
3.0,The pants were a little short and the arms were a little short and I’m 5’5
3.0,[[VIDEOID:9ed3b543a5bd7b7a949aa9b2e081b859]] Run small bought xxxl but husband was able to fit the xxxl and he normally wears xl but didn’t know it came with a mask and I bought an extra mask .. need to say it comes with mask ..
3.0,The bottoms fit great but I had the cut the padding out of the top for my boobs to fit and it still fits a little small. My boobs are 36DDD and they still kinda protrude out of the top a bit
3.0,It is contoured for your chin so when you talk it comes off your nose.
3.0,"So I really want to like this over spending more on a similar style but this isnt quite what I was looking for. Listing notes cotton blend. There is absolutely no way this contains cotton. It is a thin rough poly, reminds me of an 80's blouse. Fabric is not the exact same as in photo either. A lot more dark spots. False drawstring and high waist. If I do keep this I will be swapping buttons, but expected to at purchase. This is an xl, i am a size 8, 5'1"" wouldnt work for anyone taller expecting a full pant length but still could work as a crop/capri. I am a 36dd and I cant recommend you purchase if your chest is any larger than that. It does require a lot of shimmy and pull to get off and on, not good for emergency bathroom breaks. Flosses the undercarriage if i raise my arms. No stretch in the material. Sorry for pixilated messy closet but wasn't taking the photo for the review but noticed no one had uploaded helpful photos. Star deduction for size disparity, difference in fabric."
3.0,"Really small pendant and the cord sucks, bought hemp  cord and redid  it. Other then that its okay but definetly not worth five stars."
3.0,i bought an XL and it fits like a medium. its still very cute tho
3.0,These earrings much larger than expected. Still they were very well made.
3.0,It was too small. If u wear a medium buy a large. The hat did show up early. But its to small
3.0,"This is a nice bag overall, but not quite up to the quality and finish of my Floto and other bags. I bought a Wilson's black rivet bag in distressed black leather with a sale code on their own website for $50 less and ended up with a nicer bag. My Floto Venezia, on the other hand, cost around $40 more than the Baigio but was of noticeably finer quality. Well worth the extra money. Nevertheless, my daughter saw the bag and fell for it, so I ended up not returning it. Here's the difference. The hardware is smaller and not of the same caliber as I'd expect at this price point. Second, the rivets are not gusseted, nor is the handle attached to a strap that runs down to the bottom. Time will tell if this leads to strap failure. Not a problem on other bags I've seen for less. The leather is a nicely colored reddish brown but has a slightly more &#34;painted&#34; look than my other reddish brown bags where more leather grain shines through. The Baigio arrived crushed to conserve packaging space. Even my Rustic Town Travel duffel at $139 arrived packed with filler to avoid creasing. As a result, the Baigio had deep creases. When the bag is less than maximally filled, the result is that some deep grooves spoil what should be a beautiful look and shape. Not quite cracks, but deep enough to think there may have been a defect. The bag should have been finished and dried and kept in shape with filler, then placed in a fleece bag like my Floto Venezia ($191), Rustic Town Distressed Brown Duffel ($139), and Leathario Duffel ($198 and a much bigger and nicer bag). Each had arrived in style, packed very nicely and in their own cloth bag to avoid marring. Alas, although the Baigio is not a bad bag, at this price point, it falls short on a number of key points. Simply put, does it hold clothes? Yes. Is it nicely lined. Yes, but not quite up to snuff. Does it look good? Yes, but not like its competitors. Will it last. Not sure without the reinforcements, gusseting or full length support straps."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift, and I ordered a large bc my friend is tall and thin. I wrapped it without looking, and I got a text asking if I thought he ate too many cookies for the holidays....he sent a picture of the shirt that said 3x on it!!! I was so embarrassed, but his wife made him try it on. It fits fine, like a large is supposed to. I'm glad it fit, but I wonder if this is a 3x size or a LG that was misprinted?? The quality was good, so that's why I feel it deserves so many stars, but the sizing is questionable."
3.0,"The birds on my wallet are misprinted. They're missing lines and not blue birds with black wings like the picture. However a wallet is a wallet, it does it's job."
3.0,This dress has something all over it upon arrival.
3.0,"My son is obsessed with glow in the dark things, so I bought these underwear.  He loves the one pair that glows, but otherwise will not wear the others because they are not soft.  I thought after wearing and washing a few times they would soften up, but no.  I would expect a different feel for ""cotton jersey"""
3.0,Shoe looks nice just hurt my small toe
3.0,I ordered two of these for my bridesmaids. When I put one on the style was cute and it sparkled well. The other one was chipped up pretty bad to the point you could see the white plastic ball that was painted to look like a pearl. Luckily these were pretty cheap so I just tossed it out.
3.0,"So, my kid loves these, even though, as many reviewers stated, the lights don't keep working.  My girl knew this when we ordered, and was still stoked about the gold metallic, and rocks them proudly even if only half the lights work.  The button for the lights is at the ankle, so she bumps them on accidentally all the time, but it's no big deal.  As for the shoe, I thought they would be all scratched up and gross after a week, but they look okay still and were worth the $20-25 bucks we spent.  I'd get her another pair if she wore these out."
3.0,"Based on description thought this would be a light weight, versatile, mid length skirt. It’s heavy, double layered and long. Color is accurate. Not what I was looking for."
3.0,"I generally wear a large in linen shorts and these just fit and are not baggy like the photo.  If you want them to fit like the photo, I suggest ordering 1 size larger.  Quality is ok, kind of thin"
3.0,"It’s a shame. They look good, fit well and are soft. Today I wore first time to shovel snow, my whole body was warm but hands were going numb in 30 minutes. I am returning and looking for ski gloves."
3.0,They did the job but could have been a better quality
3.0,"Good for the value. However, the folding lines have stayed even through multiple washes!"
3.0,I give this 3 stars because the watch looks nice but the time kept not being right. Something going on with the winder
3.0,skirt was longer than what I expected
3.0,"This blouse looks great and was a nice weight for year round wear. However, my arms are a little large so it fit me awkwardly in the upper arm area. Other than that it is a nice top."
3.0,It runs a bit on the small side. It is not very comfortable on my wrist because it is too tight. But it looks nice.
3.0,The bra is just too small in size and in style.  Need to put more length in the body (long-line) for the larger sizes like mine.
3.0,It’s a great bang for your buck. The glitter kept falling off though and there’s not much give to the crown
3.0,"Cute jean, the size was 2 sizes off or just not for women with any kind of backside"
3.0,"This is the second pair i've ordered. I returned the first one for the exact same defect. The stitching around the butt area becomes undone if you do some physical activity with them, like a squat or lift your leg too high (as you would do during hiking or backpacking).<br /><br />Neither the pants or the waistband are tight on me, so I don't think it's a sizing issue. It's a stitching quality issue.<br /><br />I'm pretty bummed out because I liked them a lot but given this problem they're unusable for me."
3.0,"These are very pretty, nice movement due to design.  The pouch makes it a nice presentation.<br />The pearls are small, which I believe the size is in the product description."
3.0,Hat fits my head just fine. It's too tall. Almost have to pull it down to my ears just so it doesn't feel like I am wearing a top hat. Color is as I ordered.
3.0,"Bought for my second graders, they are a little on the smaller side. Didn’t fit most kiddos"
3.0,The ears and trunk are really small and the tail is large. Proportions all wrong but it's a costume. I'm anticipating having to tell everyone I'm an elephant. We'll see how it goes.
3.0,Didn't like the material nor how it looked on me. I think better fit for tall slender females.
3.0,"My son loves his Christmas gift. The quality is very good, the thickness of the chain is perfect, the length is perfect and not too short, the charm is beautiful and the necklace looks like came from a jewelry shop looks good quality. I brought silver jewelry cleaner just in case his chain or charm gets rusted.<br />Update: this chain is not even real silver I put in silver jewelry cleaner and it messed up my son's chain. I'm very disappointed"
3.0,Wished it was a little open in the arms.
3.0,ordered in 2x but it looks like a large. I do not recommend it
3.0,"Great price, but run very large."
3.0,I liked it but the sizes are too small! I ended up giving it to my daughter!
3.0,Unless you have no cellulite and don't wear underwear dont purchase.
3.0,"When reviewing this hat on line, I noticed the side buckles that would increase the size of the hat.  I understood the hat was one size fits all.  Well, I wear an extra large hat and even at it's fullest extension, the hat was way too small.  I liked the material and color and would have liked to keep the hat.  Returning the item wasn't a problem."
3.0,"lovely, just too small.  I thought they would be a bit larger."
3.0,"Pretty, but of low quality.  Some stones fell out."
3.0,It look more sparkly in the pic then in real life bummer
3.0,"Smaller than I'd expected.  I guess the measurement is on the outside so the inside useable space is less.  Bought them for organizing pills/supplements but will need to buy another type.  If the size is what you are looking for (about 1.25 inches on the inside and 0.5 inches deep) then these would work nicely for you.  Quality product, great deal. Just wish they were twice the size."
3.0,"Handsome, well-made leather card holder, for business cards, I presume – that’s what I intend to use it for. I am still not sure that the thumb slot is for, though."
3.0,"VERY NICE, HEAVY , TOTAL THE SIZE AS SEEN, I BOUGHT IT FOR MY NIECE TO WEAR, BUT I AM GOING TO GIVE IT TO HER HUSBAND BECAUSE OF ITS WEIGHT AND SIZE....THE JUST ADOPTED A LITTLE BOY"
3.0,I used a pair of tweezers to try to get these on: bad idea! Scratched it but it's not too noticeable! Will be buying more
3.0,It's like 15 bucks on hot topics website.
3.0,"Although I ordered 3 Large masks, they are so small that they pull my ears forward.  However, the ridge in the middle keeps the mask out of your mouth so I will probably replace the small cotton ear straps with elastic -- seem to be worth the effort, though I wish Asics would make a version for American men."
3.0,They were adorable when they would stay on... I guess it's for a bigger child. My grandchild is only two. Very well made!
3.0,"This was smaller than I thought it would be. It’s not real, I don’t think. But it’s still pretty. The chain is so cheap looking. That’s the main reason I don’t wear it much."
3.0,"This scarf is pretty but much bulkier than I expected or wanted.  However, the price was right and I do wear it."
3.0,Cute dress but when I received it their was a hole inside the pocket.
3.0,Much smaller than other sweat shirts
3.0,Went flat after a month of use.
3.0,Fit was somewhat smaller than expected.
3.0,"I really wanted to love this bracelet but it doesn't work for me.  It feels a bit masculine which isn't my style. I will say it is beautifully crafted and packaged,  as others have mentioned.  Just not for me unfortunately so it's going back."
3.0,"Very cute and decently warm, but this boot has no traction! I am so disappointed because it is very slick when you walk on compacted snow. You should buy another boot especially if you're willing to pay this much because there are plenty of cute functional boots. It works fine if you're not using it for snow. It's a nice fall boot."
3.0,I loved it but it broke way too soon
3.0,"Disappointed because I love this too, but when I bought my normal size it’s too tight to wear😢"
3.0,The jewelry was nice but so small you could hardly tell it was a bearded dragon.
3.0,Not flattering to my physique
3.0,These were too small for my head. They were uncomfortable and eventually slip off.
3.0,I am 5'8 and this thing was all up in my backside. It was big in the front but somehow it was short and I was in a XXL. Just absolutely not worth $99.00. My wife got the same one (but for women) and that one felt WAY WAY better. This just feels like fake used material they got off the corner.
3.0,Pretty item that my wife likes a lot but these have needed gluing multiple times.
3.0,"These are well made and good quality as well as priced rite , just a little lighter denim weight then Dickey's but still very good and well sticthed.  If your child wear these and you are wondering about the quality,  they are very well made and looks traditional for overalls jumpers. 12/10/2019 update of this jeans jumper ,one of the shoulder metal buttens came off and that should not happen the first day it was worn ,the Dickey's brand had been through a lot and is a year or old and has not had this happen ,but this brand was purchased because they where the same price as the Dickey's brand was last year and the Dickey's has doubled in price ,but the quality of these are much less , I was able to get the button back in the hole but the back is loss and it is part of the clamping to keep it from popping back out . I purchased two of these. It disappointing."
3.0,Good material but still hard for me to get on
3.0,After just over a month it stretched out and can't be worn.  Too late for a refund.
3.0,too snug
3.0,Odd fit overall. Maybe best on small chested woman but this barely covered top. Bottoms feel like granny panties. Disappointed.
3.0,Looks better in the picture.  Polyester and looks inexpensive.
3.0,"It’s a nice piece, but it is just costume type"
3.0,This small crossbody is cute but it was still just too big for me.  I wanted something small and lightweight to carry my cell phone and keys while at work or walking my dog.  But it just didn't work out for me.
3.0,"Super flimsy and I know I can get this for like a dollar if I have it shipped from china, but this will do since I don't want to buy a $15 headband for a trip."
3.0,charm and necklace fading can you send me another one?
3.0,"I use these for the shower at the gym.  They work fine, with the only drawbacks being:<br />1.  They run a little large<br />2.  They're actually purple"
3.0,Usually wear a medium but went a size UP due to other reviews
3.0,"Im 5'2, 144 pounds, and I ordered the medium. The dress fits perfectly, comes to just above my feet. The only thing I don't like is that it is a spandex type material, when I was expecting a t-shirt type material."
3.0,"It won’t fit on my waistline,  I ended up giving it away!"
3.0,"Just okay.  Doesn't look much like the picture - the design actually looks like it is floating in the acrylic bead but it is not a very bright red and the design doesn't stand out well.  Blurry.  Oh well.  I'm going to pair it alongside my other Xmas bead (very cute) and it will be okay - when I find a nicer bead, I'll have no problem replacing this one."
3.0,"The swimsuit is cute, but it don't last long. A day at the water park and the mermaid scales on the bottom disappears 😡. But I guess that's what u get when u only $12 🤷🏽‍♀️ For a swimsuit."
3.0,My granddaughter is tall for age 4. I should have purchased the next size up. Th pants are short
3.0,It does eventually fade.
3.0,"I ordered 2 shirts and they fit perfectly, I ordered 2 more at the same size and they are extremely small. Disappointed but the first 2 are amazing."
3.0,It's cute. Looks a little different though . The blue in the picture is brighter than it is.
3.0,The coat was exactly what I was looking for but was WAY to small. I’m currently trying to figure out how to exchange for two sizes up. Having trouble getting an exchange.
3.0,"Beautiful piece, came broken..."
3.0,"I really like this dress, but if you are large busted, this does not run, as some reviews say, generously.  I bought a large (I buy L or XL in items typically) and went smaller based upon the reviews I read... Well, the item fits, but it is tight across the bust which ruins the whole point- sending it back."
3.0,They are super cute but run very small.
3.0,"The gloves did the job by keeping my hands somewhat warm in January while in Italy, but the material which allows me to operate buttons on my cell phone kept failing me... I had to constantly remove my glove to snap pictures or navigate through my phone. The tip was of a poor quality. 2 yrs ago I purchased a nice pair from Walmart, but my son had since destroyed them, and walmart has never carried another black pair.. so I tried this,  didn't work as planned."
3.0,"They are rather well made at first glance and I love this pattern. I bought it for my nephew's 3rd birthday party and we went to incredible pizza (similar to chucky cheese) unfortunately they did not last the night. after a few amusement rides the pants ripped on one of the seatbelt buckles, luckily I had needle and thread on hand to fix it for the afternoon but he couldn't wear them again :/"
3.0,"Like the pant fabric but was surprised at the fit: waist has no give at all so certainly won’t be able to wear those if I gain 10 pounds. I wanted the straight leg and these are - but just above the knee. Below the knee they have a lot of flare, which wasn’t what I wanted. Fabric washes and dries well."
3.0,The picture appears to be a loose fitting top but must be a very large size on a smaller sized person. I am normally a size 8. I wanted the loose look as shown in the picture. I order the XXL and it is tight fitting. The front part is higher than you would expect and the back is lower but fits tight around the rear. Almost appears as if it is cupping your rear. I tried it on with skinny/legging type jeans. The color was similar to the color shown in the image for the Red Uget Women's Basic Tee Shirt Loose Fit Hi Low.
3.0,Very thin material that is kind of cheap but it is cute.
3.0,I ordered a three pack and the pink and gray one are great but the blue one is tiny!I don’t even know anyone small enough to give it to. I mean it is tiny probably kid size the other ones fit my frame perfect.The sizing is not consistent
3.0,I was very disappoint with this dress. It arrive on time but the inside slip was way smaller then the dress. I had to bring it to a seamstress to try and fix the slip. Plus the split on the dress was not connect to the slip and it made the dress like off or incomplete.
3.0,Scratchy material- not a lot of compression
3.0,Material was unwearable for more than 3 minutes. They were thick as in not breathable and itchy and rough as heck. Not see through at all though. They are the closest thing to actual leggings I ordered though. Like you could wear these out pretty inconspicuously without anything over them.  The built in Boy shorts are extra hot as well.
3.0,they were okay. not very rose gold. fairly large. not recommended as a second hole earring.
3.0,"This outfit fits my daughter as expected. It's soft and comfortable, but not the softest or warmest of this type of outfit that she has. The word at the bottom of the shirt is ""CPERSEVERANCE"" which is odd. It makes the outfit seem cheap. But it works well as an outfit to play outside in that I don't care about whether it gets stained or messed up. It has been holding up just fine in the wash and seems to be well made and durable."
3.0,Doesn't really work for those with slightly larger bust size. Fits my sister great who had the smaller chest.
3.0,"I give three stars for the packaging it came in.  It’s a lovely hat for Derby Day, just wish it came boxed.  It does fit my head and I like the adjustability of it."
3.0,This Apple watch protector sits really high on the wrist (which I could have dealt with).  I returned this band/case as I did not want to take the watch out every night to charge!
3.0,"Was all apart when received but was able to put together.  For the price, that was simple to do."
3.0,The fabric is of nice enough quality and the cut was fine. I want expecting the puff of the sleeve. The square neckline wasn’t what I was expecting it to be either - the elastic along the opening was a bit too strong to let the neckline stay open/square like the photos.
3.0,"If you use your hands in your profession, this isn't the tracker for you.  The steps are very inaccurate. :-("
3.0,"I was super excited about this dress but it was so short and I'm only 5'4""! I had to wear it with some skinny jeans or leggings. It wasn't as comfortable that way. It's a great fit and it's well made - just short."
3.0,"Doubt it'll last past first use out. My bottom hems weren't even sewn. I won't be even able to wash it. I'm 5'9&#34;, 150lbs got a M. I'm also a cup, so some how top was tight. V shape ended at knees and hem infront half way down thighs."
3.0,"I absolutely love this band. I was recently cleaning it around the ""clasp"" part and the metal poked through and ripped the band. I will be ordering a new one."
3.0,"Was a little large and I had to pin the back so the top would fit. The color was nice, the material is okay, but the size was just off."
3.0,These are very pretty the colors are great. You can NOT adjust these at all so if they don’t fit you can’t wear them. They are too loose on me so can’t do anything with them.
3.0,"I needed Switch wristbands to play other movement games on the console, games like Just Dance. While playing with the wristbands, a plastic piece came out from one of them on the second song and the movements weren't even that strenuous."
3.0,Made of what i call granny material. It does look like picture but material is horrible its polyester and sikly feeling if you like like kind of material then you will like this dress it is nicly made i just didnt lkke material at all.  I got a medium it fit good just was a little long on me but due to type of pillow material it was made of I did return it.
3.0,good for occasional use.  lil one complains of them hurting his feet if in them for a long walking day.
3.0,Looks just like the picture<br />The bust area is quite large though
3.0,"This dress got really good reviews, and I think if I was a little taller or the dress was a little smaller it would have been good. It was too loose on my torso and had extra fabric that bunched up on my waste and did not flatter my figure. The material is heavy, but form fitting. I have a flat stomach with an athletic build. I'm 5'3 and 135lbs and petite. I ordered an XS and it still wasn't small enough on my waste, but everything else was fine. Because of this, I had to send it back, unfortunately. In the pictures, I really tried to make it look good but when I relax or just walk the dress fits funny and it's obvious it's not fitted. I had to keep pulling to down to compensate for the bunching of fabric on the waste. I hope this was helpful!"
3.0,"okay, itchy fabric, too small"
3.0,"Thin material, cute tho, but you can tell it’s cheap"
3.0,"Very nice looking belt. The belt works well and feels soft to the touch. It certainly looks like real leather, but it is not. Would have given it 5 stars if it was real leather."
3.0,I will try a different vendor next time. Looks and feels like fake leather to me
3.0,"These do the job, however are very large for a woman."
3.0,I would say they are bit more then expected. Cleaner looking and well fitted to my eyes.<br />Not a 5 stat they are not even!
3.0,"Not sure what is use it for, as it is SO SMALL."
3.0,"The fabric is not good. I like the style and color,  but it looks cheap because of the cheap quality of the fabric. Also buttons make it look cheap too. It’s okay to wear at home or for going shopping."
3.0,These are &#34;not&#34; individual containers that stack! They are stackable/screw on with only 6 lids. so as broken down they equal 6 stacks of 5 round containers that screw apart.
3.0,"While the coat quality was excellent, I ordered this in a 5X and it would not go over my arm, let alone fit me. I normally wear a 2X and based on the sizing and dimensions stated by the seller, this should have fit, however it looked more like a US Medium than a US 2X. The fabric was very soft, the color was vibrant and it would've been very comfortable to wear. I am pretty disappointed that I won't be able to wear it, but I gave it to my US Medium-wearing roommate, and she loves it."
3.0,"Don’t believe the hype on these with regards to keeping your fingers warm. With the amount of snow blowing this year and taking blood thinners my fingers would not withstand the cold. I was really hoping that these gloves were the solution. In 5 degrees above zero my fingers were cold within 10 minutes. I resorted to gloves inside my wife’s wool mittens. These gloves however are good looking and practical in temperatures in the 30 degree range. I will keep them, but they’re not the end all to very cold temps."
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed because very little, if an arch support was provided."
3.0,Cross literally fell apart in my hand second time wearing it. I didn’t expect much for the price but still enjoyed the item.
3.0,"I would like to give this wallet a 3.75 rating, not quite a 4.  I like the look of the wallet, however there are a few drawbacks:  the pockets that hold the credit cards are a  bit small/ tight making it difficult to insert/remove credit cards.  I am hoping that the pockets will stretch over time.  I transferred my things from a my old wallet, but could not fit all of the things (I could not zip the wallet completely).  I now have a separate coin purse to handle my coins.  I am assuming  the RFID blocking is working, but I have no way of testing that feature."
3.0,"This mask is just okay. Super thin. Also note it is not the mask in the picture lol. It has princesses and it's okay. I'm a little disappointed because I have other Disney ones from Old Navy that are similar but a bit thicker and softer. Since you can get a 3 pack for $10 elsewhere, I prob wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"There is a lot I like about these pants. They are so unique and edgy and the large pockets are amazing!!<br />However, I’m having issues with two things:<br />1. The light grey material of these pants is really thin, my body is much colder in those areas, and it is pretty see-through in bright lighting.(I attached a picture of that.)<br />2. The material these pants are made with picks up everything! I accidentally brushed against the comforter on my bed while taking pictures of these and I came away with a ton of cat hair on my butt.(I also attached a picture of that.)<br />Other than those two things I like the pants. I’m 5’6”, 120 pounds and the small fits me well. They make the butt look good. But I am still on the fence of whether or not I’m going to send them back. The see-through material might be a dealbreaker for me."
3.0,"theyre kinda like tubes of thin cloth sewn into a sock, not really fitted for a foot."
3.0,"I love the print on this dress, however, the cut is very odd. As another reviewer mentioned, it's cut very narrow in the bust and exposes a lot of side boob. You must wear a bra or bandeu top underneath or beware of nip slips!"
3.0,"Nothing about the presentation of this gift said ""I love you"". The box I received arrived very scratched and marked up with the corners of the stickers already peeling off. Makes me wonder if it was a returned item. Anyway, its a decent novelty gift, despite the unacceptable condition of the box. My wife appreciated the thought thi. A little embarrassing that I paid more than $10 for it after seeing the quality but lesson learned."
3.0,Expected a better quality product. But it is still good. Looks and feels and fits ok
3.0,"These are ok tank tops, but the quality of them isn't very good.  The strings are all starting to come out only after a few wears."
3.0,Super great material but the pic shows it coming down further in front. Wear a racerback but it’s cut in super right at neck so doesn’t cover straps. Sending it back but it’s super cute.
3.0,"Must not overfill c card sections, will make it difficult to retrieve. Other than that a good buy"
3.0,"Decent, I like the colors. Does it’s job. Light enough to breath through, a little on the tight side."
3.0,"These shoes are very warm and stylish, however, there is not enough padding on the heel. Anytime I walk, there is a hard protruding object that hits my heel and hurts to walk in."
3.0,"It was way to small for me (Mens Large) but fortunately works for a woman's medium.  She likes the fabric, cut and feel."
3.0,This product bruised the top of my foot.
3.0,This jacket is really cute..very light weight only for show don't try wearing it when it's cold out alone. You will Freeze
3.0,"Be advised, Spirit is changing &#34;personal&#34; carry-on size effective 3/31/2016.  &#34;Dimensions must not exceed 16 x 14 x 12 inches (40 x 35 x 30 cm) including handles and wheels. For travel after 3/31/2016, dimensions must not exceed 17 x 13 x 8 inches (43 x 33 x 20 cm) including handles and wheels.&#34;<br /><br />**REVISED 2/8/2016**<br />Looks like Spirit reversed their change plans and the FAQ page on their website no longer mentions the smaller bag size.  From Spirit Airlines:<br />&#34;We had been preparing for a potential change in personal item sizes, however we decided a few weeks ago not to implement that change. While we always like to encourage passengers to carry less, we will continue to offer the largest personal size item of any ultra-low cost carrier. &#34;<br />Spirit's new CEO maybe trying to do things nice?  Hmmn."
3.0,"If you want it to look flow-y size up at least once. Not really a dress for curves; hugs all the wrong places and looks awkward if you have hips (I'm a size M). Pockets aren't functional (really low, flimsy and visible). Tried washing to stretch dry, but didn't do much. Will prob donate or try to alter."
3.0,There beautiful but too heavy and big
3.0,"I'm guessing it's not suppose to be comfortable because it's not, but I'm going to wear it and hope as I come down it will become more bareable."
3.0,Fit is great and I like the lightweight fabric but I’m returning it because there are no pockets.  I have to have pockets.
3.0,A little to short for me but cute
3.0,The size is too small. It runs very very small .
3.0,"This ring set is super cute and fits true to size. The downside is that the black coating on the ring does not last long at all. With everyday wear, making sure to take it off to wash dishes or shower, the black wore off inside of a month. It is now just a gunmetal grey, which really takes away from the overall beauty of the ring, and makes it dull. Alas, you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"If this was just a bit bigger, enough to hold a few cards, it would be the perfect wallet. I wouldn't mind paying a solid 20$ for it IF it was bigger. If you're just wanting to put cash, keys, and coins, it's perfect. But the side pocket is too small for cards."
3.0,Ok for the price.  They are not made of great material.  Neckline is too wide.
3.0,"Comfy ring, but does not spin well."
3.0,It fits funny
3.0,Not much compression in these shirts.
3.0,"I bought this for my wife, she is a size 4 and it fit her everywhere but the bust. The material was cheaply made. I would only recommend it to those with a small bust under a size 4."
3.0,"The look and feel of the strap is very good for the money, I’m happy with my purchase. HOWEVER, I did not give it 5-stars because the spring bars are too short - if you like a snug fit, buy a different strap or swap out the spring bars (I recommend Barton)."
3.0,"I order a large and it is to small order up, the material is great tho"
3.0,"This mask was not as pictured.<br />In the picture, it looks tan and brown but what I received was olive drab and brown.<br />The material is paper thin too.<br />Haven't had a chance to see how warm it is yet but it does look very cool on.<br />I will update later."
3.0,Easy wash and wear care. Fabric is more silky and stretchy so therefore more clingy. Would prefer 100% cotton t-shirt material. Liked it enough to buy in three colors.
3.0,"There not the best boots , the good one are twice as much."
3.0,"a nice looking necklace, thanks"
3.0,"The thickness of the material for these is a little bit thinner than expected.  Also, they are quite snug.  We bought the size suited to our little one's weight, but the size runs smaller than expected.  Also, there may be some shrinkage in washing.  Other than these small complaints, they're pretty decent...especially for the price."
3.0,"I bought this for the bridal leather on my Filson Rucksack.  Used about an 1/8th of the bottle one evening.  It absorbs into the leather quickly and has a pleasant odor-- not petroleum based.  I was disappointed the next day when it looked like the leather didn't get treated at all.  If you are looking for something to rejuvenate and condition I'd go with their salve, it is a wax-based product and seems to add more moisture to the leather.  I'm going to follow their direction and see if this could be used as a topical touchup periodically for shine."
3.0,"The metal clasp piece is not very secure, would not trust attaching anything important like keys to it.<br /><br />Would not recommend"
3.0,"LOVE the look and feel of this shirt, although I would like it in a XXL if they had it (I normally wear large and ordered XL, not quite as loose as I'd like) BUT the big issue is that the sleeves are WAY too short.  Looks very silly. And they have cuffs so there's really no way to make it look okay.  Need at the very least another inch on the sleeves, 2 inches would be ideal.  The body of the shirt looks pretty short too.  I'm 5'7"" 177lbs."
3.0,"These sunglasses may very well be the darkest pair of sunglasses I have ever seen. Wearing them during the day, it looks like night. If a cloud comes overhead, it is very difficult to see"
3.0,Some of the reviews said it runs small so I bought a medium...should’ve bought small (I’m 5’4” 108lbs) as it was kinda big. Hope it’ll shrink some after wash.
3.0,The fit was too large.  Big in the shoulders and bust.  Tie dye colors are pretty pastel - very pastel.
3.0,"The overall look of the costume is exactly as expected, but the mask is too small and tight around the face. I thought the eyes would have a mesh kind of material so you can see out of it, but no. When you look through it, it's like trying to look through a sheet."
3.0,MUST HAVE OBJECT CLOSE TO MAGNIFING GLASS.NOT GOOD FOR COMPUTER REPAIR OR ANY TYPE OF SOIDERING.
3.0,Looks a bit on the cheap side up close. But overall they are cute & comfy
3.0,I was loving this bag. It provides a place for everything so you can put everything in its place. it's deceptively roomy as well. The problem is a already have a hole in one of the compartments. bummer. It would be a five star review otherwise.
3.0,"Loved the skirt and how it looked on me, but it was way too short. I'm only 4'11"", and it came to mid thigh on me, wearing it at my natural waist.  It unfortunately rode up on my legs with every step, and after just walking around the house with them on, the skirt barely covered up my butt.  There was no way I was going to be able to wear it high waisted like I had bought it for.<br /><br />Perhaps it will work better for someone with less of a pear shape and doesn't have a bubble butt."
3.0,It's cute but runs small...I would say order a size (or 2) up if you don't want it clinging to every curve :-)  Material is very soft and lightweight. Also the color is off quite a bit...I ordered Navy and received Blue and White.
3.0,Pretty shirt but not an appropriate length unless you're looking for a belly shirt. Will work well tucked into a mid to high rise jean or skirt.
3.0,"I purchased these for my husband's birthday, August 8th.  My husband liked them right away, stating that he liked the style and the comfort.  But, by August 16th, one of the rubber stems on the ear pieces had already fallen off.  Very frustrating that part of the sunglasses broke off within 8 days."
3.0,"Feels more like nylon than cotton.  My feet get more hot in these than when I wear a regular, even thicker, cotton sock. Nice socks but I wish it had more of a cotton feel."
3.0,Al parecer hubo un problema con el size
3.0,"Love the material and workmanship, but I ordered XL and it literally fits like a Medium."
3.0,Love them! Help with my restless legs...
3.0,a bit too shiny
3.0,Dress is not as pictured. The quality is just ok
3.0,These are cute but the first day I wore the black ones they got several runs in them.
3.0,"It would be a &#34;somewhat large&#34; but the rest of the body fits fine. There is not a smooth transition between the chest and the stomach. There's a weird puffy spacing (if you have a flat stomach) that starts from the stitching under the breast to the stomach. If you have large breasts (i'm a DDD) and a flat stomach, that's what probably gives that weird puff. Also, the armpits are a bit too big and wobbly. Otherwise, the material is very sturdy, and seems like a cute dress if the fit was right."
3.0,"Snapped where the back meets the crossing of the straps. I do love the material, and it covers the nips 😅"
3.0,hard to set and instructions dont correspond to watches actions but a beautiful time piece
3.0,"pretty sad because I ordered thinking it was a set so I’ll be returning.. but the shirt I received fits as expected, looks cute, and is comfortable."
3.0,If you plan on tilting this to display the rings know they will not stay in place very well.  The rings look great and its a cool display piece just make sure you are going to display the box glass side up so the rings don't fall out
3.0,"I wanted to like this dress. It was comfortable, a beautiful color, and the length I was looking for. The way the panels are pieced so that you have a curved seam going over your belly, though... othe reviews mentioned it, but I thought it couldn't be THAT bad, because I barely noticed it on the model.<br /><br />It kinda is. I think especially if you have any form of belly. I am currently three months postpartum and still working on losing the last of the pregnancy belly. That curved seam hit my stomach in a very unflattering way. If they had been at the hips, it would have been fine. Alas, that was not the case.<br /><br />I am 5'5"", currently 150-155 lb range, 36D."
3.0,This product gives the impression that the chain is included but you just receive the charm - no chain included. Now you have to buy one more item to be able to enjoy wearing the crystal. I found that annoying.
3.0,I really wanted to like these pants.  They are actually great quality and I have no doubt they would keep my sons warm. That's why I gave them a 3 even though  I returned them.  Unfortunately the sizing is absolutely off.  I purchased a 14/16 for my 13 year old and a 10/12 for my 10 year old.  Both are normal average size and they wear these sizes normally.  The 14/16 was the first to arrive and it was so short I thought for sure it was meant for my 10 year old. I had him try it and it was a bit higher than his ankles.  Way too short.  I didn't even bother having him try the 10/12 when it came in.  Not sure who they used for sizing.
3.0,For the most part the product fit as expected. I’m a small and ordered a small and it fits like the image on the model... I will say though they are a little tighter around the bootie and front than expected but not to say they don’t fit. What I was disappointed with though is how itchy the fabric is on the inside :/ I’m trying to soften them in the wash but meh
3.0,After a few hours of wearing it started to hurt my ears… not from loud music but from the device pressing on my ears
3.0,"Waaaay too big. I ordered a small, which is what I normally wear. Sometimes I wear a medium. You could put two of me in this blouse! I'm going to give it to my mom."
3.0,I was disappointed in the fit. The t-shirt was on the large side and the sweatshirt was to small around for the person that I purchased it for. I ended up replacing the sweatshirt from another source because it was for a gift and I will pass it on to someone else.
3.0,Cheap material but fits as expected
3.0,Nice elegant tie that looks great with my black suit.
3.0,"Too tight for my face.  If you’ve got a big head like me, don’t get these."
3.0,"This is the second time I am buying this, because it seems the elastic strap frays and goes bad after a couple of year. $20 is a bit pricey for this simple strap."
3.0,I got a tank top instead of the one shown with sleeves.
3.0,These socks are okay but I hate wearing them because the top is really thin and the bottom is really thick. I want my socks evenly distribute of wolven material. It's really hard to have shoes fit because of them this way. I want my 1980's and 1990's socks back. I hate this situation of the thin on the top and thick on the Bottom sock I hate that.
3.0,Due to review say this ran very big I ordered a M when I usually a L/XL this dress was so big and long Maybe an XS would fit of course I returned it.
3.0,"This shirt fit and the colors was great, but it was not as long as the photo. The shirt came to the top of my jeans."
3.0,"I love the ties but one came with noticable spots, but i like the ties."
3.0,This is a great bandana for a costume.  If you want to use it due to the pandemic it is worthless.  It is made of the same type of material as a kids reversible basketball jersey with giant gapping holes.
3.0,Great! I have used it a couple of times since I rated it. I did have a problem with the handle. The screw holding it together came loose and it was stripped. My husband had to replace it. It was more of a hassle and inconvenience.
3.0,They are cute but kind of hard to get on my daughters feet.
3.0,"Unfortunately this didn't work for me in at all. The fabric was not comfortable on my skin and the design was not proportioned for my body size and shape. It was both too small in the bra cups and too big around in the rib band. If you are a B-cup, this may be perfect for you."
3.0,"Love this so much that even though I am an Amazon Prime member, so I paid extra shipping cost to get it to me overnight prior to attending a banquet dinner In Buckhead Atlanta 2 weeks ago! Got to Atlanta, checked in hotel got dressed and put the choker on and the silver clasp ripped out of the fabric! 1. I did NOT have it to tight because I was about to readjust it to tighten it up, and 2. I am by no means fat in the neck area! I wanted to wear this so bad with my outfit but glad it fell apart prior to the banquet because that would have been embarrassing if it would have popped of at dinner time in front of others! So I never got to enjoy this beautiful choker! Requested a return shipping label and just received it the other day and shipping it back this week!"
3.0,"The description said plush upper “terry.” This is NOT cotton terry which is what I was expecting. The synthetic material used for the sole makes my feet burn. Instead of using them for every day house slippers, I’ll just use them for after bath. A bit disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,Looks nice but it’s a little tight
3.0,Like the color and feel of shirt. Disliked the neck opening it is much to wide.
3.0,Beautiful just runs a bit big.
3.0,"This dress is nicer and thicker than most casual dresses purchased (here),  at this price range and above. I had no issues with the quality of the material, or dress length. However, this Size Medium is so big that it hangs extremely loose on me like a curtain and makes me look pregnant-- I need XS to pull this off. I think it's suitable for others who love extremely loose fitting apparel, but this is simply not for me.<br /><br />Since it's not available in XS size, I have no other choice but to return for refund. If this dress happens to be available in XS (in future), I'll definitely purchase due to the quality and pattern of the material."
3.0,"Meh. I guess if you know what you're getting into with toe socks, you'll be ok with these. Not very comfortable. Wanted them for yoga but they just aren't really comfy enough to get my 'zen' on. hah"
3.0,"It is very comfortable fabric, stretchy but too form fitting.  If you have a great body that's fine, but it shows every bulge and can be unflattering."
3.0,"I believe that this product would be great if the case padding (where the controller sits) would be thicker to protect against impact. The net (where you can save cables and other accessories) should be slightly looser as you've got to force close it.<br /><br />Other than that, the Stadia controller fits as expected."
3.0,I found the sizes running a little small with the slipper very tight across the top.  So I am still wearing my old pair
3.0,"Cute dress, but I bought the wrong size. I usually wear a large, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to get one size smaller due to most reviews saying its a bit stretchy. the sleeves are long and the dress is long in comparison of the provided picture."
3.0,"These insole are very firm and the arch support didn't line up with my arch.  I work 10 hr shifts and am on my feet for the majority of my shift.  I would come home with swollen, painful ankles.  After wearing these, my arches are a little sore, but my ankles are neither swollen or hurting."
3.0,the top is cheap and heavily padded and can see the interior lining which is white.
3.0,This is a decent skirt I expected it to be just a bit longer.
3.0,"Pretty good shirt, the material is a little different. Rougher in the center and silk soft on the sleeves. Plus it is a little more see through than i was expecting. But that helps the material breath and makes the shirt more comfortable for southern CA weather. Overal priced appropriately and worth getting."
3.0,Have to return due to a streak stain it came with. Runs big.
3.0,Not as shiny as in tbe picture shown
3.0,Cute dress a little long - I’m 5 7 and I felt like it was too long-
3.0,they are cute but only work on really think flip flop thong sandles
3.0,"In todays age where everyone is complaining about politics, religion, global warming etc., etc., etc., we can ALL still agree on ONE thing...<br /><br />We dont like our ass to itch! this product has not one, not two, but THREE tags in it (and that is not counting the easy to remove cardboard tag). Oh yea and it fits too small."
3.0,Bottoms plenty big but top fits snug. Love the soft cotton.
3.0,The center stone is TINY and you can't even really tell what color it is... I sent these back and got something else.
3.0,I really like this nose ring. My only complaint is that is was difficult and a lil painful to put it in my nose piercing. Once I got it installed in my nose it worked perfectly fine. You have to turn it sideways to get it on and turn it through both loops then it will sit right on your nose.
3.0,Just as advertised but you will have to put these together--I also heard a few toddlers say they were too tight.
3.0,love the shirt but it was smaller than expected. I'm 5'8 and big chested so its a little too small in the chest area. the arms seemed to be a lot smaller than usual as well so its kind of tight. I wont be able to wear this any time soon which is a real bummer because it really is super cute.
3.0,Nice didn't fit watch
3.0,"The bag looks gorgeous! However, it is really heavy, and you need to be very creative to squeeze in a phone and a lipstick at the same time.  The chain is short, you cannot wear it on the shoulders.  I am giving it 3 stars -  the chain broke the first time I wore it, the bag fell on the floor to my embarrassment, and my stuff got out on the floor.  Fortunately, my phone did not crack. I will not be wearing it again, although, as I mentioned, it is a gorgeous bag."
3.0,Do not feel these held up to what was described and run very small.
3.0,"Color is very vibrant, Thin material, and I’d say order a size up. I ordered a 7/8 they say true to size but I’d say not so much. It will fit my son but probably not long. The front pocket stitching is lose will be using someone bonding tape to repair. I’d rather do that then mess with a return."
3.0,"I don't mind the length and material, but the belt loops are a bit too high, making it uncomfortable when you tie the robe around your waist. Otherwise, it would be perfect."
3.0,Actually I wound up returning the case... so I really can’t say much on using it but the reason I returned it was that it was just way too big... it would have looked silly & got caught on things with the work that I do...
3.0,"Love this outfit but the top fits large. I ended up buying two, so I could get a smaller top. Also the bow was not included."
3.0,"I ordered the full sleeve blouse in black. I was very excited to get this shirt, but was actually fairly disappointed. On the bright side, the fabric feels very nice on my skin and is super breathable. I also like the way the back of the shirt looks. Very cute. However, and I am amazed to be saying this, it is too big, especially in the arms. Immediately upon removing it, I could see little loose threads everywhere which means poor craftsmanship to me. Putting it on is a bit like working your way through a maze. And, the sleeves are just not right - the 2nd strap from the top is completely pointless as it just falls down and hangs sloppily over the 3rd strap. The straps are too big and cause the underarm part to dangle entirely too much. The solid part at the bottom of the arms was, however very comfortable and I don't mind it bunching up a bit (as it shows in the pictures for the product description). I would have liked to try one of the 3/4 sleeve styles, but none of them were available in my size. On sale, it is an ok top, but at full price, I would be very disappointed. I don't plan on returning it. I am going to remove the threads and see if I can sew the straps a bit. If you want to try this top, my personal advice would be definitely do NOT order up a size and make sure you have an appropriate colored bra or cami to wear under it as it is fairly sheer. Or, honestly, if you need a beach cover up, this would actually be pretty decent in that capacity. Overall, it's still an ok blouse, but you should go into your purchase aware of the numerous little issues that add up. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,"The print is nothing like the picture. It is more Lima bean green and covers the entire shirt. My child wears a kids large so that is what I ordered, it fits him like a dress way too big."
3.0,It didnt say they were short.  I need regular 12.  If I didnt wear to work I would return and still might have to.
3.0,"I wish this worked out because I really liked the silk and cotton blend. The size L I ordered was larger than most XLs, which is sub-optimal. Getting the collar to lay properly after washing requires you to make sure the collar is 'up' (not folded) and the top button buttoned when you pop it in the washer.<br /><br />FWIW, I've put it through the washer and dryer (initially to try to shrink it) contrary to the care instructions, and not only did it not shrink at all, it seems no worse for the wear, so I keep laundering it with the rest of my clothes ""like normal""."
3.0,My 38D cup are too big. It fits me but found myself always making an extra effort to adjust the chest area. The bottom portion fit weird as well.
3.0,I didn’t like the material. Wasn’t really as stretchy as I’d like it to be.
3.0,"First of all, I'm a girl and happen to like the fit of certain men's shorts.<br /><br />I like these shorts! I really do, but...<br /><br />When I first bought these shorts, I bought a large because you never know with these Asian sizes on.<br /><br />To my surprise, they were a little loose and decided to try on a Medium.<br /><br />They arrived on time, but when I opened the package, the shorts smelled ""perfumy,"" like cheap fabric softener or some dumb scent.<br /><br />These shorts did not have a tag on them; therefore, these shorts must have been worn and washed!<br /><br />Also, the left zipper is busted and looks worn. You can see the silver metallic on the zipper instead of black.<br /><br />I understand that these shorts may have been returned at one point, but if you're going to reissue these shorts, inspect the inventory upon arrival!<br /><br />I'd give 5 stars if the large fits me, but I'd have to go lower because of my experience with the medium!"
3.0,Moderate quality. Full price.
3.0,Way too small. Plan on trying another size because I love the fabric!
3.0,Kind of cheap but ok
3.0,"I like my shirts to be a little more fitted.  It was a nice shirt, but wasn't for me.  I returned it."
3.0,"Seems like he really meant for women. But, I love the pocket because I have a bunch of gym shorts with no pockets"
3.0,"Overall good piece, but it is slightly different than pictured. The color is more forest green and it is more leathery than you expect. Color is slightly different on the edges and back. The back mesh is more red. But overall good and fits in the chest very well."
3.0,Overall it's a nice watch. Although I just bought it two months ago and the analog time has stopped working. That's pretty frustrating.  You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Band colors did not match  if look closely. However, looks cool if not looking closely"
3.0,Hands are not luminous as advertised.  Can't  see time in dark.
3.0,perfect for a beach day...
3.0,Looks amazing but so far it it’s not durable. Chain broke on first day. They replaced it immediately so let’s see
3.0,Super cute but fits a little awkward in the armpit where it buttons.
3.0,I like that they are long. But the material makes them slippery so they don't stay put. Plus the ends are just rough cut.
3.0,Too big... Makes me look larger than I am..
3.0,Overall they are cool but ring size wise they are default at size 7 when I recieved mine they couldn't even fit my pinky I wanted them for my thumbs though. Overall neat object just doesn't fit any fingers for reference my thumb is a size 11
3.0,The product was tighter than I liked and not quite true to size. It also got a run in one of them like pantyhose so I probably wouldn't order again.
3.0,I thought it would be bigger and there was a chip on it.
3.0,"We have to separate the jacket from the customer service. The jacket is all they said it would be. I like it. However, I was SHOCKED at SCOTTeVest's CEO's social media post. He called conservatives who bought ScotteVests &#34;f...ing conservative...idiots.&#34;  I was now embarrassed and angry and didn't want to wear the jacket that I paid $174.00 for.<br /><br />I called customer service yesterday (Feb. 6) and the customer service lady apologized for their CEO &#34;who was not longer with us&#34; and quickly attempted to rush me off the phone. I said, &#34;wait, wait...why are you rushing me off the phone?&#34; and she started yelling at me (yes, the call WAS recorded for 'customer service improvement') and when I tried to talk to her further, SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  This morning I attempted to &#34;chat&#34; online line with their &#34;vest expert&#34;. She apologized for their &#34;no longer there CEO&#34; and then suggested that I should talk to that CEO. She proceeded to give me his email address (Scott@scottevest.com) showing that he is still at the company - or why would he have that email address?  I asked that the present CEO needs to write to every customer who purchased a jacket or vest who was offended. However, now I am supposed to write to their &#34;no longer there&#34; CEO. Sense my frustration? I now have an expensive jacket that reminds me of a very rude and ineffective CEO and customer service."
3.0,I get lots of compliments on these headbands but I've noticed they're a little too tight and start to hurt after wearing for a couple hours.
3.0,I’m 5’7” and slender. They were really too big. The quality was good.
3.0,"Size down.... it fits great when first put on, but after 4 hours, the denim had stretched and lost it's shape a bit. After 6 hours, they felt unflattering. I feel like a size down would have been a better option. I'm a size 8, wide pelvis structure, flat belly. I will purchase a size 6 when back in stock. The fraying has not shredded too much and I ended up cutting off the fold at the bottom of the pants- as the pants stretch, the shape feels off even there (I'm 5'6""). I prefer the raw edge cut over the fold anyway and it looks cute as these frayed out well after a wash. I continue to wear them if it's a short date or anything less than 4 hours. I will say they are extremely comfortable, come up over my bellybutton, and I have received at least 2 compliments on them every time I wear them. The button fly is easy and doesnt look to pull or pucker at the button seam line. I really like them, but will like them better a size smaller :) hope this helps you!"
3.0,Bows are flimsy wont stay on head when I bent over
3.0,Material wasn't as expected.
3.0,Nice but much smaller than it looks in the pictures.
3.0,It looked more sparkly in photo than in reality. For the price though it will work out ok.
3.0,Fits well. Has some stretch. Goes on leg goes up the knee. Open toe. Great for when I’m sitting for long periods of time. Help to keep circulation in my legs. So that when I do get up it doesn’t feel like my feet are asleep.<br />Soft. Love the pink color!!<br />They don’t stay in place. It would be nicer if there was something on the top part by the knee to keep them in place. They do slouch when I walk. Annoying to have to keep pulling them up
3.0,It is a lot smaller than expected.
3.0,"Beautiful print and the material is very soft. The fit is a little weird, but my measurements are abnormal so it could just be me. It was a little tight but poof in the waist and a little too short for me, just not flattering."
3.0,"Really pretty. Ordered true to size it was very tight fitting. Sent back and got a larger size, it was still a little tight. I’m a large and they didn’t go up to a xl or xxl in the color I wanted.<br /><br />If it came I. The color I wanted and I could order an XL or XXL I would get it."
3.0,I got an xlg as most dresses that have the elastic in the waist scrunch pretty well...this one did not have as much as I expected and it was too baggy on me. I added a belt and there was too much extra fabric bunched in the chest.
3.0,"The fit on these wasn't too tight, but just tight enough to be uncomfortable to wear for a long time (5'9, size XL.) Overall, I didn't end up liking how they looked. I pretty much got what I payed for as far as quality; The ombre is done poorly. And with the specific color that I got, the darker purple color was really more of a dark blue than a purple as it shows in the picture."
3.0,poor Quality of material
3.0,It doesn’t fix loose and is too tight around arms and waist
3.0,Straps burst after about two months of weekly use
3.0,Over all quality of the hat was great! Shipping was super fast! But the hat was very misshaped which I didn't like.
3.0,"I liked the product, but on the 2nd wear, it tarnished around my neck..."
3.0,"They're OK... They look nice, but know that they are really big tie bars. Unless either you're a big guy, or wearing a big/fat tie, it's not suitable otherwise. However I will say that this makes for a great Christmas gift, or secret santa gift (which is what I ended up using this for)."
3.0,"these are really flattering but the waist goes up sooo high and the waistband gets a little tight as the day goes on (I’m 5’6, 130 and got my normal size small)"
3.0,It's cute but definitely cheaply made. You get what you pay for but it's good for a one time occasion kind of thing.
3.0,"The gown fit perfectly, until I washed it per instructions. It shrank quite a bit. I still wear it but it is short in arms and length"
3.0,nice shirt cut real tight for a 2x
3.0,My wife really liked the style of this shirt in the pictures but was very disappointed once she received it.  She is a medium but this shirt seemed a bit too short.  The fit is not flattering and somewhat wide at the bottom.  The ties on the sleeves are cute and the ruffles also lend it some style but the fit really lets this down.  Add to the fact that this is a 100% cotton so likely to shrink which will make this look even more odd.
3.0,"Love the earrings, but they did come come with enough backs for all the earrings."
3.0,"i have gotten alot of compliments on this necklace, however... the clasp broke while i was asleep....  it bent open and came off.  i bent it back and used superglue and a clamp to hold it in place....  i would have expected a little higher quality product for the money i paid."
3.0,did not like the way they fit
3.0,"Hat is nice, a little out of shape from mailing but really nice quality. Happy with purchase."
3.0,"These slippers are very soft and the colors are very pretty. Unfortunately, the elastic around the opening is very loose, and they keep sliding off my feet.  🦶"
3.0,"The shirt is cute, but the sequins are difficult to move in either direction to see the picture. I got this for my 4yo neice and she struggled trying to flip the sequins, and as a result some would fall off"
3.0,I bought 1 and it fit perfect. Unfortunately l left it in a hotel room when I was traveling. I reordered the same one but it is a size to large. 3 stars because of the size issue.
3.0,"These are not no show on me. However, i kept them cause they stay on really well and are comfy."
3.0,"the dress fits well, the cover is small and definitely not made of cotton. Some polyester or other synthetic fiber."
3.0,It's just what I was wanting.
3.0,"This dress was really cute, but unfortunately I had to return it.  The sizing and arms were just too small."
3.0,"Super cute but BEYOND TOO SMALL!! Notmall I'm a medium, sometimes large, depending on the company.  But this suit, which I ordered large in, fit like a small!! Very disappointed because I thought the print was very cute."
3.0,smaller than the average medium shirts I have
3.0,I love most everything EXCEPT the neckline.  I feel it pressing upon my neck and I don’t like that compressed windpipe feeling.  Otherwise incredible product.
3.0,"Not at all the color it looks like, it's much darker and it's very long and tight through the shoulders."
3.0,Nice little casual piece.
3.0,"Very nice & soft shoes, but size is much smaller, not true size, it is more like Asian size guide."
3.0,"Great clip, but the magnet deactivates hotel room cards.  After four trips to the front desk to reactivate my card, I learned my lesson and had to carry the hotel card in a different pocket for the remaining three days of my vacation."
3.0,"I guess I am spoiled after buying Darn Tough socks, these are not as good so I returned them. Bought another pair of the Darn Tough and I am good to go for another two years. Yes I said years, they cost more but they really last."
3.0,"The description says white, but they are a very light pink.  I will keep them and use them as they are disposable.  I just wish the description was clearer."
3.0,Disappointed  with fabric
3.0,"The leafs pull at everything, to pointy"
3.0,"They are nice but kind of bulky at the top and a little to big for my glasses, but they block the sun so that is what they are supposed to do."
3.0,"Definitely order up a size. I normally wear a M (I weigh about 125), but the bottoms were WAY too small. The top cuts into your boobs a weird way. Might look better in a different size, but I did not like this product."
3.0,"bought cause i love penguins, looked cool on line, when i got it i thought 'ehhh' gray/grey color very mediocre.  not winning in my book."
3.0,"very nice material but size not right, sleeves too tight and hard to get in and out of"
3.0,"tried regular batteries but didn't feel much heat, I need to purchase some rechargeable  li-ion batteries to see if there's any improvement"
3.0,"This dress is adorable and the pattern is super cute. Unfortunately, it’s just not well made. Strings were pulling and we lost a button at the first try on. We got a medium and she’s a small but it still runs small so if you risk it, order up!"
3.0,"First of all, let me say that this is a sweet little ensemble. I was happy with the weight of the fabric (it is a summer item, after all), the knit is lightweight and I believe would have packed easily, ready to wear at your destination with a good shake-out. It drapes well, and has a nice hand. At 5'9"", I was content with the length of the skirt. I am well proportioned, and muscular,  and ordered the size large with confidence. I was disappointed upon delivery as the top was tight, but manageable (I am an A-barely B cup) ... however the skirt, which was advertised as fitting up to a size 40 inch, would not even meet at my waist ... by several inches! And my waist is no where near 40 inches! I suspect one would have to order at least a size, perhaps two up to obtain the gracious drape pictured on the model. If this item was offered in curvy-plus sizes, I would happily reorder in a 2x. Also, there was quite a bit of residual dye on my skin afterwards. As I was returning the item, I have no knowledge of whether the transfer of color would be remedied by washing."
3.0,I bought a size up based on other reviews and I like the fit. However there was a hole in the pocket.
3.0,"I love the look and feel of these dresses but they are cheaply made.  The elastic on the bust has unraveled on every dress, which means they don't fit like they should anymore."
3.0,Fabric only ok quality.
3.0,"Fine but very hard to put in and very easy to lose the pieces. I’ve never had trouble with metal push in studs but the pin on these is pretty short and so it’s easy to miss your target and easy to pull out by accident. I had three of them in a row and accidentally managed to pull out the top of all three in one go. That said, very comfortable to wear compared to metal studs. I put these in because my piercings weren’t healing well because I was sleeping on them and the butterfly backs were irritating the piercing. After a few weeks with these, they were more healed, but the frustration of getting these in and having them pull out was pretty intense."
3.0,Comfortable but do not last long.
3.0,"Cute but very very difficult to program, no directions."
3.0,Almost too short.  Sleeves shorter than pictured also. Different cut than photo.
3.0,"Nice, The stones are tiny."
3.0,"Mine arrived damaged (sewing was horribly messed up around the waistline) and was out of stock so I couldn’t exchange for another. It was absolutely beautiful otherwise, though which is sad. The zippers weren’t cheap and worked well, the fabric felt great, the color was bright and it fit well. If it hadn’t had that defect, I would have loved wearing this swimsuit."
3.0,"The pattern of the leggings are defiantly cute and affordable, beware go at least a size or 2 down if you want a correct fitting! Customer service is quick and helpful! Hope this helps!"
3.0,I found these smaller than I expected.
3.0,Returned. Runs very small.
3.0,You need a long torso for this to fit properly
3.0,Cute<br />Wrinkles very very easily so not great for just throwing in bag but I live how light and cute it is
3.0,Strap around heel is too tight! I’m a size 8 shoe and it digs into heel area. Not comfortable
3.0,"I returned these because the ear loops were too big so the mask kept falling down. I also thought that they were 100% cotton and the ones I received looked and felt like a polyester blend. They may be good for a larger person, just did not work for me."
3.0,First pair I opened had a flaw on the lens and they seem to be pretty big in size.
3.0,Confused.  I thought I was just getting a Kaleidoscope. It seems to be some kind of a one sided goggle with a kaleidoscope lens.  Not sure what it is suppose to be used for.
3.0,"This bracelet is very nicely engraved and looks nice; however, I have thin wrists and it falls right off. I am unable to make it smaller and it is very unfortunate. I really wanted this to work."
3.0,"Never wore this kind of sock before.<br />I put on a pair and wore em around the house for the evening under Vans to try em out.<br />When I took the shoes off to go to bed, both of the socks had holes in the toe!<br />So the first pair went in to the trash right away.<br />Probably will try another brand."
3.0,does what it's supposed to do... barely.
3.0,"the picture is deceiving, amazing construction<br />I thought it was a bracelet, so disappointed.<br />It is important to read the whole advertisement<br />2 times .  O'well it is a supper cute ring."
3.0,Size was too big for a small
3.0,Poor quality... the bottom dangle fell off the first time I wore it.
3.0,Slightly hard on the face and mask hooks do not stay in place.
3.0,"These are good enough, kind of small.  I had hoped they would be a bit larger."
3.0,"They fit well over my glasses, not heavy, and are fairly comfortable to wear.  They brighten things up!  I didn’t notice a difference with glare though!"
3.0,If you carry all your weight in your stomach like me get a size up and wear a padded bra. It’ll save you the self consciousness. Also the buttons are not sewn together so they bubble very easily making you look large
3.0,Should have ordered a larger size and I didn't realize there was a design stitching at the empire waist I thought it was all smooth but not bad overall
3.0,The material is very uncomfortable for summer weather
3.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and 117 lbs, I ordered a small and it fit okay.  I am returning the dress because the waist sits at an odd place.  It is not on my natural waist line and not really high enough to be an empire waist."
3.0,The fit was perfect a bit see through but nothing a slip can't fix stitching was irregular someone pointed that out so its a house dress now
3.0,Haven’t had it long; I honestly didn’t even notice it wasn’t black anymore. It’s alright for what it is
3.0,"It says it’s a low profile hat, but that isn’t remotely true considering the fact that it rests on my ears; most low profile hate have at least 3/4 inch between the hat and my ears."
3.0,"Nice jacket. What ever size you normally buy , go 1 size bigger on this..."
3.0,"Comfortable, nice material and correct size...sadly they were so short! They were above my ankle and my legs are not long."
3.0,"Seemed like decent quality, however I ordered my regular XL size and the shirt fit me like a latex glove. Sorry, I don't like my clothes to fit like a wet suit. I'm not &#34;slim&#34; but I am also not overweight. I'm muscular and like a little room. They should stipulate that this is a &#34;slim fit&#34; made for SKINNY people who like tight clothes."
3.0,hurts my nose a little
3.0,These would have been great if they were the patterns in the pictures. The ones that came are kind of ugly.
3.0,It runs small but graphics are awesome. It's more polyester than cotton.
3.0,Cheaply made and runs super small
3.0,"The magnetic buckle is in the middle instead the end like the original, which makes it sometimes stuck when removing or putting it on. Magnets are super strong though"
3.0,They were ok i guess for the price.
3.0,Pendant look nice on the picture but .....when I received the pendant....it was very small. I thought it was supposed be large one?....Oh well
3.0,quality is good. But it fitted too small to me.
3.0,"These bracelets are cute, but do appear to be on the cheap side.  The coloring isn’t quite gold, but isn’t bad.  They are lightweight and definitely run smaller than the stated size.  I was able to get them on and they were cute, but I cannot speak to value for money since no price is showing at the time of this review.  I don’t think these would hold up to long time wear, but as cute, costume jewelry, they work."
3.0,"I like the color and the fabric, but they fit a bit too tight and I got a larger size than needed."
3.0,Love the color and fabric is soft.  Just too big
3.0,The sleeves where too wide.
3.0,The insoles were harder than what I wanted. I liked how they were generous and sent an additional set of insoles. The arch support was less than what I needed. But overall not too bad for the price.
3.0,I DO NOT like to leave negative reviews but to be honest these are not at all sturdy. I lost one the first day I wore it and the second one only lasted 2 days. I tied them with two knots yet it wasn’t suffice.
3.0,Everything is cool except the color is off. I wanted what's in the picture and the only thing that was right is the grey
3.0,I would rate this 5 stars but it stopped working on me for no reason.  hade to buy another one.  so far number 2 is still working.
3.0,"I really like the look of the bag and it's a perfect size. It's got a ton of great compartments and it fits everything I need to fit, but it smells sooooo bad. Seriously it smells like pure fish...... I've had the bag a little over a week and have been using it to try to air it out but it still smells horrible. So buy at your own risk..."
3.0,Not alot of stretch. A little over priced for being a basic light weight Jean material
3.0,They are comfortable but they don't hold their shape very well.
3.0,I liked that the bar was thin but after 2 weeks the bar turned and it was gold anymore.
3.0,"On the large side and plastic, not metal. Returned."
3.0,"Love the big cat ring.  I wear a size 7 and it fit great.  Really disappointed in the middle ring, the one paw was just a circle, didn't look like a paw.  Small one was ok.  Broke after 5 months.  So sad."
3.0,"Instead of OSFA maybe they should go with Small/meduim and a large/xlarge,  I cannot see a person with a large frame fitting into this vs a medium size person."
3.0,"Love the style and color, but the seemed too wide!"
3.0,"Really pretty earrings but a bit smaller than I was expecting, and the pair I had never seemed to hang right. They always looked a bit crooked.<br />I sent mine back even though the design is awesome."
3.0,Kind of tight.... may want to upsize this one.
3.0,I like the design but the fabric was thinner than I would have liked
3.0,"The fit is great, and the fabric is soft and silky. The only issue with these is that the material becomes a bit see-through when stretched across the skin. For example: When squatting, you can see the skin as the material stretches across knees."
3.0,it's a nice shirt but it's not made for anyone large chested even in the larger sizes. it's too bad because it fits great everywhere else but is goofy af on my chest.
3.0,"Bought as a work belt, cut it down to size and fits perfect. Only problem is the black coating on the buckle will very easily scratch if it rubs on almost anything.  I work at a bar so leaning over the rails instantly made the face of the buckle unpresentable. Good for show, not great for durability."
3.0,It was not red and white polka dot  rather more of a pink and white. Oh well.
3.0,Too big for me and distorted vision.  Donated them!
3.0,It’s cute but the rings are really chunky and stick straight up rather than lay down... especially the “Jerk” ring.
3.0,The color is a little lighter than the burgandy loafers I wanted the belt to match but the quality is descent for the money.
3.0,"Fell apart within first day. Was not expecting much, but this fell short of my expectations."
3.0,"Ordered up to a 2XL based on other reviews (due to being larger in the bust area) and I can BARELY button it up over the girls but it's HUGE everywhere else. I almost ordered 3 or 4 of these but decided to try one out first. I just don't like the fit and the fabric is stiff, not really that soft. I'm hoping after a few washes, it will be soft enough to use as a pajama top."
3.0,"Good color but to light weight to be a sweatshirt, not a good quality.  Do not buy for warmth, just for a cute shirt message."
3.0,I am always on the look out for warmth and flexibility for riding all year in New England. These are warm but just a bot bulky for my liking.
3.0,While these shorts were comfortable and generally fit as expected they looked more like sleep shorts than shorts I would wear to my workouts. I ended up returning them since they did not fit my needs.
3.0,I have 5 other lace camsettes and I love them. I wear them every day to work. They didn't have this taupe color in lace so I bought this one. I do not like it as much. It tends to ride up whereas the lace ones do not and it wrinkles easily. The lace ones never wrinkle.
3.0,these are bigger than i had hoped. There should be a size comparison picture.
3.0,"very short, does not cover behind. I am 5'6&#34; 130 lbs. Not sure how the girl on the video could be 5'10&#34; and it cover her behind, unless they changed the sizing of the product. Other than that, fabric quality is fine and tassels are a cute touch."
3.0,Nice robe for coming out of the shower. Not cute but serves its purpose.
3.0,"We have loved it, but it is too small.  I'm about a 7& 1/2."
3.0,Most of them work perfect but the 17/19mm the one I would use the most cracked immediately on the first use. The rest of them have served me done.
3.0,"I bought a large but fits exactly like a medium. The arms, overall length and especially the upper body are of this jacket were too small. Despite what the measurements say for the inches I would size up one from what you usually wear ,unless you like your clothes tight and fitted. The quality of the jacket is alright and looks good."
3.0,"I had ordered 8 of these for my daughter's spa theme birthday.  They worked well.  One was missing the belt.  Due to the inexpensive quality of fabric, expect some fibers to shed.  I bought a fabric paint pen, printed on a paper each of the girls names, put the name under the fabric (wearer's left chest), and personalized each robe for the girls, that made the robe a little more special.  Would suggest for anyone planning a little spa-rty!"
3.0,"Can't wear it -- fits perfectly everywhere but the top. It is just slightly too big because my chest is too small. I am 111 pounds, 5'7, with a 34A. =( Sucks cause this was super, super cute."
3.0,"I wanted a pair of cargo pants that would look professional and fit properly. The picture showed a man wearing a properly fitted pair of cargo pants. When my pants arrived, they were baggy compared to the photos. I don't expect my pants to be slim fit or skinny jeans style but I do expect the pants to have a more modern fit. I didn't want to meet people wearing baggy cargo pants. These pants did not have the fit I wanted. I am returning them after I tried them on briefly. A little disappointed since the price was right and did come fast in the mail.<br /><br />Sorry, I woulf not recommend this product to my coworkers."
3.0,Nice belt but no directions on how to use.  It did not suit me for my needs as my pants have loops that I need to take beltcoff a lot.
3.0,Sleeves are a little short.
3.0,Cute sweater with wool like material but there are odd cut outs in the sleeves and along the hemline
3.0,Band falls off at the watch not at the clasp. When it stays on it is a nice band. Gave it a 3 star because if you switch the connector on this bad with the one that comes on the original band it will hold on much better. It still comes apart from time to time but at much bigger intervals.
3.0,Seems to be ok
3.0,Love the pendant but the chain was not strong enough and broke quickly. I bought it for my daughter who's pretty sad she can't wear it until I find another chain.
3.0,This purse wasn't what I expected when I got it.  The handle is uncomfortable and to fat but the metal part dug into my shoulder.  The bag was too flimsy and would stay up when I had things inside of it.
3.0,very difficult to wear as they keep turning all over the place.  Looks great in photo but not practical for use anywhere that I could find unless you are walking barefoot in the grass
3.0,Could have liked it but it was ridiculously small.
3.0,"Love the idea of this, but unfortunately the quality wasn't what I had hoped. The material is super scratchy and uncomfortable to use as an actual handkerchief.<br /><br />However, this is more of a sentimental piece anyway. So I was still able to use it on my wedding day and my parents loved it"
3.0,"This is a Luigi costume that came with the letter M on the hat.  Unfortunately,  I ordered late and don't have time to send it back.  I cut out a piece of white felt and glued it over the M.  I then drew the L on the white fabric.  I see in the reviews that a lot of other people received a hat different than the one pictured with the L.  Also,  the mustache is merely felt with a very small piece of double stick tape on the back.  I can't imagine this is going to stay on more than a few minutes.  We will use this costume but I was definitely disappointed with the error on the hat and the flimsy mustache."
3.0,is ok.
3.0,Sleeve is made from good material and the quality is great. I would give this five stars except the stretch band at the top is too tight on my bicep.  The fit guide is correct because it fits fine throughout the rest of my arm. The quick and dirty fix was to cut this band but having to deface a brand-new item was a disappointment.
3.0,One of the pairs was cracked right when I opened them. But otherwise okay for price
3.0,"Don’t like the way it feels on my face too much, especially i sweat  It almost has a sticky texture. Needs a smoother plastic. . Happy"
3.0,Please watch YouTube video reviews before purchase.
3.0,"The band is not as thick as this picture led me to believe.  And the strap is longer than I need.  Can't find directions on how to shorten it without cutting it, and I'd rather not do that."
3.0,It's cute. It was a bit large around. I kept it as we have a boat and are at the lake constantly so it will be fine for my needs.
3.0,Fit is good - not as warm as I would have hoped for...
3.0,"It’s a beautiful set, but I returned it all because the choker necklace looked tarnished, like it had been worn already. LOVED the color, style, and price, though."
3.0,Nice but I haven't washed it yet.<br /><br />*Update*<br />Love this dress but it ripped!  I'm so sad.  I think it was just a weak spot in the fabric but it's a bummer.
3.0,Kind of loose around stomach areas
3.0,Bought as a bag gift. Price reflects quality. Broke after 10 minutes.
3.0,The boxers do not have a fly! Got them as a gift and the recipient didnt use them because of this. They look nice though.
3.0,It easily get scratch.
3.0,"The patterns are super cute and the material is lightweight, which were two of the main selling points for me. However, the cut is too large to snugly fit either of my children's faces, so they kept falling down rendering them useless."
3.0,"When I go these 4 jewels already fell off so I'm going to have to hot glue them back on. These earings are cute but I also had to find different backs for them because the backs that came with the package don't keep the earings up, they tend to sag. But, with the right backs to keep them up they're very cute."
3.0,Collar could have been much larger does not over your whole neck
3.0,Beautiful bracelet but the toggle does not stay on. I wrote to the company in hopes of an exchange and they never responded so I don’t know if it was just that bracelet or all of them have that same issue
3.0,"The belt is fine... I did expect it to be a bit wider & the studs to be a bit bigger. There was no description of the studs, they appeared to be nickel chrome instead of gunmetal."
3.0,Not what I expected but very useful. However you can not put much in tote. I'm a teacher
3.0,I ordered the floral 3 pack and got the black 5 pack. Material was a little thicker than I thought.
3.0,"I wanted to love it, but I really hated the way this shirt fit on me. It's loose and frumpy looking on the top, while clinging to my stomach through the middle. The sleeves are way longer than pictured, and baggy, so they make me feel hot and covered in fabric. But if you want to feel covered, this is ideal for you. The neckline is also modestly high.<br />It's a comfortable shirt, and is decently well made, it's just not for me. I feel even larger in it than I already am."
3.0,"These shower sandals do the job. Dry quickly. However, they are too tight and are very narrow. If you have wide feet, like I do, I wouldn't recommend them to you."
3.0,Says age 3-12.  Think it is more like age 5-12 as they are too big for his big head.
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  It's not high quality, but it does the job for the price."
3.0,I like the product but it runs small. So as it is now it's no stars as I can't wear them but the product itself is nice and if it fit I believe I'd give it all the stars. By the size chart I would wear the xxl.  Order up a size or two.
3.0,Okay material.  Stretchy.  Nylon zipper which gets stuck around the waist band where material is thicker/sewn.  The dress was too long in the torso for me.
3.0,The pendant is a good size and looks fine (deep true red color) but the parts of the chain was stained/rusted when I received it.  I replaced with a 24k gold necklace and it looks great.  Earrings (color) matched the pendant.  I'd preferred post instead of fish hooks but for occasional wearing it is okay.
3.0,"I was looking for a replacement front pocket wallet with RFID blocking.  Thought this would fit my needs: slim, front pocket, RFID, Id windows.  Once I put my cards and ID in, it actually turned out to take up twice as much space as my previous wallet.<br /><br />Build quality and design is great.  I just wouldn't consider this slim or front pocket."
3.0,Comfortable but because there's elastic on the sides make it had but big.
3.0,"The dress is too small and I`m thinking to return it. The color is very nice, the filning on the skin is nice too but the size is unfortunatelly too small"
3.0,Happy with the umbrella but not the lights. Having issues with getting the lights to turn on and starting on at times. We have only used the lights maybe 3 times since purchase which is very disappointing.
3.0,Its kinda form fitting. It's rather see through though. material is soft but if you buy it make sure you have a sweater or nude under garments
3.0,It is to big but still nice
3.0,"These are okay - a little small and for some reason they kink often at the place where they link to the french hook, causing them not to dangle loosely as they should."
3.0,"Pretty dress.  Not for tall ladies (5' 10""), the waist came to my bust leaving the dress looking overall... rather maternity-ish"
3.0,its ok . the fit is nice but the color is way brighter than i thought .
3.0,Do not like them
3.0,Fabric is not what I thought
3.0,This is made out of a very thin synthetic costume fabric. It'll be great for Halloween which is what I want it for but would not be great if you planned on using it for something like a Renaissance Festival.
3.0,When I got it The small hand held piece was dirty
3.0,Very soft but the sleeves are super long.  I'm 5'10&#34; and would have to fold the sleeves up for sure. Seems to run a little big so if you're looking for something baggy go with your usual size otherwise you might want to size down.
3.0,"Loved the style of this top; however, it was way to snug for me, and I usually wear an XL, so I had to return it.  Plus it was a little too see-through for me."
3.0,One had a broken snap. Disappointed but the other worked nicely for my 5 year to use at school!
3.0,Very cute! Not the color I was anticipating. I didn't order Navy. But fits good runs. Little small.
3.0,"Reasonable construction, but thinner than expected. Overall OK."
3.0,"I bought extra large because one review said they ran small; however, could easily have used a smaller size."
3.0,Super cute but I wanted a size 3 baby/toddler and these were more like a 5 or 6.
3.0,They fit perfect....but they don't breath.  I have to take them off to let my finger dryout...so they don't get white and look like a prune.
3.0,Very awkward shirt if you ever raise your arms up. I'' a photographer for a living and cannot wear it.
3.0,"They're cute, but a little low quality according to my wife."
3.0,"They’re so cute, but I didn’t feel the slightest bit of compression from these."
3.0,Packing was great. I'm 5'8&#34; 150lbs. Fit a little snug and the bra lining was very stiff so it made my breasts look like I was impersonating Madonna. Maybe bigger breasts are needed for this to look right...
3.0,My daughter-in-law loves them. But they are too tight
3.0,I love this print! But based on the size chart and reviews I ordered a medium and it's too big. I wish I had ordered a small. I am 5'7&#34; and 134 lb with no curves.
3.0,"Pretty as described , just didn't care for the packaging"
3.0,Socks are comfortable but unfortunately don’t stay put and slip off my heel.
3.0,"Sooooooo adorable, however, the bottom ball comes off easily and gets lost.  Glad they were not expensive."
3.0,Was supposed to fit extra small but it was big enough to fit a medium size woman. Had to return.
3.0,"Quality is so so, but I like the style a lot. It’s worth to wear even for just a season."
3.0,Cute dress but looked sloppy on me. I returned it.
3.0,"This product runs large. I ordered an M and had to return for a S. I'm 5'4 and it was just too long otherwise. It did really smell like smoke when I unpacked it, but airing it for the day worked. The stitching on it wasn't great, but for the price, its exactly right."
3.0,"Cute dress, unfortunately the straps are way too long. Bandage material fits good (sturdy but breathable)."
3.0,"Very pretty and I get tons of complements when I wear it, but the fabric is odd. Kind like swimsuit material. It is very comfy though!"
3.0,"Very teeny, weenie bikini.  super cute design but I wish my bottoms were just a little more coverage"
3.0,"I didn’t like the color, In the picture looks red but when arrived the color was more like bright orange to me."
3.0,I ordered it for my boyfriend who likes cats cuz I thought it was just precious. I loved it because of the back it was supposed to say kiss me but the one I got didn't have kiss me written in the back of it. It was for our anniversary so I thought it would be purrfect. Overall the cat is the same as the picture which is awesome considering the back was different
3.0,Pendant is very good but chain is brittle hit a second one after returning but the chain broke in 2 days of wearing
3.0,Cheap quality. You can see the metal wire around the edge of the hat.
3.0,"Kinda itchy,  sizing was a little small"
3.0,"This was a gift for a friend, cannot review."
3.0,"Soft material, but would size up for lose fitting vs. clingy."
3.0,"I love the channel set princess cut CZs. Hard to find. The clasp will be loose. I returned the first one and reordered, hoping the next would be better. Not so. I fixed the problem myself with needlenose pliars. Just tighten the side loops and expand the insert bar. Problem solved. However, if I have to keep bending the insert, it may break. Time will tell. Dropped a star due to the yellow gold beginning to fade. Thankfully, not real obvious when on my wrist."
3.0,This is a gift for my son. This is his favorite band ( even has this tattoo 1st one) I ordered this for his 20th bday. Took a month to get. I hope he likes it. I don't care for material but he might. Hey if not maybe I can make him a pillow out of it 😂
3.0,"They feel very cheap and flimsy, I've seen dollar store glasses that looked nicer.  If you just need them for props they would do just fine. If you wear pair, they won't fit ella."
3.0,I’ve bought this dress more than once and the fit is inconsistent.
3.0,"Super cute vest, nice quality; however, sizes run small. If you normally are a medium, then get one size bigger."
3.0,"It's so much larger than its measurements. I wore it as a zombie bride, so the misfit was ok but  I would have to take it in EVERYWHERE if I want to wear this again... and I don't know how to take it in. Definitely buy an underskirt of tulle to give this dress for of a feminine shape."
3.0,"Love the design and fit, however, the colors are REALLY dark and just eh.  The overall blue is beyond navy- closer to drab black, and the lighter blue is a very, very dark blue.  The sweet pattern on the lighter blue in the product photos e.g. pockets is hard to discern. Yup, they are that dark.  Hope the manufacturer considers another color combo in the future."
3.0,I want to love these - I really do! But the inside seams are really rough! So when you have thighs that rub - and then do some intense walking / running - you will be seriously chaffed!
3.0,"I'm a short woman 5'2""  and they were to short from the crotch to the shoulders."
3.0,Not really high waist and if you have large boobs just don’t even think about it
3.0,"Tiny.<br />Hard to wear without stretching, too far."
3.0,"Soft, loose-fitting, basic shirt. No complaints there! BUT... it wrinkles like crazy!! Be prepared to iron it every time you want to wear it."
3.0,The size ordered was large but it was a bit smaller than that. They shrunk pretty quickly when washed and dried. Not the quality you would expect from a Ralph Lauren product.
3.0,"These earrings are super cute, but you definitely get what you pay for. 3 stars because the diamonds are lose and feel like they’re gonna come out at any minute, and the post is so flimsy that I bent the first one all the way down when I tried to put it through the back!! Overall they are cute and worth the $5, but probably won’t last long!"
3.0,"The dress is a stretchy cheap material. It is long, 2-3 inches below the knee probably, and in the picture it is short. The buttons are sewn on. It does not unbutton."
3.0,"These Joggers are really nice  and comfortable. I would recommend anyone who needs something to relax in or work around the house. I ordered a blue, black and grey pair. The only reason i gave it a three star because the Blue and Black seems to be made from a different material and had a tapered leg while the grey one has a true open hem that I love. So if you like tapered legs get the black and blue but if you like a true open hem, get the two gray pair."
3.0,"very baggy.  I usually wear x-large.  Not flattering in the baggy style. But for the price, I'll keep it for quick trips."
3.0,"It's a really good looking band and it looks identical to the pricey Apple one. It was pretty easy to adjust the links with the instructions being clearly stated. BUTTTT the one thing I have a problem with is that the watch sometimes unlocks itself, which raises concerns for obvious reasons."
3.0,Cheap yeah look at the price. But it's like the lens are all scratched and you can't see out of them cause of that.
3.0,These glasses are pretty good for night driving but if a car is coming at you straight on u still have a very bad glare
3.0,They are great and definitely flattering to the form but are fairly tight to the body so would recommend a size higher ? They are a bit shorter than I imagined and so does rise up the body in active moment but other than that I do like them a lot !
3.0,The waist band is cut on the biase<br />The skirt is very full<br />The waist band is tight
3.0,Too long and I am not petite
3.0,Bulky fit.  Fabric hot due to padding.
3.0,"I'm a size 14, pear shape , and I ordered a large and it was  snug. I would have gone with an XL. The cups are rough. If you have big boobies it won't be too comfy."
3.0,I wear a 2nd and this cap was just too small for me. Fine for most. Returned it for credit.
3.0,The lenses are pretty but they look cheap and sit a bit awkward on the face.
3.0,Alittle short but cute.
3.0,The sizing is a bit inconsistent on these. The white and black ones were on-point but the gray shirt was shorter than the other two for some reason.
3.0,Pretty but you get what you pay for
3.0,my daughter  loved it she plays in them all day was to be a costume for Halloween
3.0,Material is thin and cheap feeling but okay
3.0,"These are very handy. Open a little different and could grip the visor better, more strongly"
3.0,When we first received it I put it in the wash &#34;cold&#34; and when it came out the batman emblem was all cracked as if it was worn and washed a dozen times. Love the logo... but the quality is crappie.
3.0,"They snag very easily, can't tell the front from the back. Pretty colors though."
3.0,Overall a food dress worked for the wedding but it came smelling heavy of old lady perfume or fabric dye. Did come out when washed
3.0,"No me gusto el material, no es cien por cien algodon, exageradamente grande,"
3.0,Love the style but it was to small had to return it.
3.0,They are little bigger in size than I expected it to be
3.0,Aren't as long as I thought they'd be
3.0,"I purchased this bracelet to wear on my wedding day to match the gold accents. The bracelet is beautiful--except the photo shows a much daintier, lighter rose gold that is elegant. The bracelet I received is richer in color and gauty looking (more cooper-toned)."
3.0,"I read a lot of the reviews and I ordered a size bigger so I got a Medium. I guess I should've gotten a large because it was a light tight around my bust. Also, I always wear spandex under my dresses or rompers (I was a volleyball girl) and where the holes fall on this dress you could see my spandex."
3.0,Love it but wayyyyy too small
3.0,these are just a bit too big.  Order smaller size.  Not as much arch support as I had hoped for.
3.0,sizing was a little different than I thought it would be... too small
3.0,"cute, but very cheaply made"
3.0,"The colors are amazing and a great variety, however the posts are very small.  I'd say they are probably a 20G, which is the size of an earring, not a typical nose ring.  I ended up giving them away to a friend who didn't mind that the gauge was smaller.  So long as you don't mind, they are a great product for the price."
3.0,I wear a size 4 and that's what I ordered. They ended up being too small and I had to reorder a 5. I like the look though.
3.0,Not very strong. Strings for ears pull b our very easily.
3.0,"nice fit but way too short, especially to the back."
3.0,Bought this for a wedding. I do like the dress but does fit a little different as pictured and material is not great. Just from dancing one night little lint balls collected on dress.
3.0,Feel a bit dry
3.0,Runs small in size and shows no written direction for cleaning
3.0,"It worked great for disc games, but doesn't work for down loaded games."
3.0,Beautiful artwork but smaller than I expected.
3.0,"Son cómodas pero al lavarla a mano, la tela suelta tinta y además el respirador negro plástico se cae fácilmente.  El diseño está bien y es cómodo, pero su tela es de mala calidad."
3.0,I like the soft feel but it lose ur cards out and it is coming apart.wish it would hold up longet
3.0,"Not as good as others I have seen, no cut out for the glasses you have to force these to close."
3.0,Not really the color it looks. It was more of a neon yellow.
3.0,The pants are REALLY small. I am 5' 5&#34; and 110 pounds so usually wear a small or extra small. I purchased a medium and the fit is WAY too small. I am  returning them for that reason.
3.0,Break easy and tires are not good quality
3.0,"I received my order today and I was SO excited! They are a beautiful set, but definitely are on the smaller side. I wear 9/16 and they slide right in and out. I think the flare is a 9/16, but the middle is slightly smaller. I am going to return these and purchase the next size up because they truly are beautiful. And you can't beat the price. I inserted  a photo, the middle plug is part of the new set and the ends are from a set I previously purchased. You can see that it is slightly smaller. It may not be that big of a deal, but they don't feel as secure in my earlobe as my others. Hope this review helps."
3.0,They run a little small so the color is as vibrant
3.0,"When these first arrived I was really excited. But after the first time, one of the snaps will not work on one of them! The other snap works, but not both."
3.0,The fit is great. Light material. A bit see thru. The pattern looks cheap. Definitely not as seen on model.
3.0,I bought this ring because I absolutely love the Claddagh and what it represents.  I had lost the one I wear on my thumb while I was swimming in a lake.  I bought this to replace it and one I should have bought a different size it was too big to be a 9 and it wasn't finished.  What I mean is a normal ring with have a full finish inside full telling or stainless what ever metal it's made from there shouldn't be a gap and there was in mine I will upload a picture of what I mean comparing the two.  Over all I am disappointed I can't wear this ring so it was a waste of money.
3.0,"Super cute fabric. But I did return it because even though I sized down, it was still too wide. Additionally, the top was much too short (and probably would have been even if I had ordered my regular size.)"
3.0,Thread at pockets not sewn well enough and came out the first day even before washing. I had to resew them.
3.0,They run pretty small but I still like them
3.0,Color doesn’t match from what is advertised. And they look used. The soles however are nice and comfortable. Not sure if I’d recommend. But to each their own
3.0,"I like these masks a lot, but I feel like maybe the snaps for the earmuffs were sewed on wrong. I couldn't figure out how to snap them on without having to twist the two on the top and bottom, but then it was too close to fit on my ear properly. To get around that, I only snap the middle one and it fits perfectly. I think I'll need to find something to cover the snap so the metal doesn't irritate my ear, and I'll just tuck them into the earmuffs. The picture shows one earmuff with the snaps tucked away and the other with them out. I hope it makes sense."
3.0,Price and thickness (lack thereof) made them perfect as disposables on a long vacation.  Would not wear them otherwise.  The side seams are weird.
3.0,"Very prety but it isn't safe for my 2,5 years old princess. She use baby stud earrings."
3.0,"The bow was unattached before I even opened the package, it's wrinkled -- which can be fixed, but not very appealing. The white fabric under the tutu is frayed as well, I purchased better quality from Wal-Mart for just $1 more. Don't waste your money."
3.0,"Watch was nicer than I thought, as long as you wind it daily it keeps good time and the movement is nice and smooth, the only thing I don't like about it is that it is thicker than I thought it would be. Other than that not a bad watch. Update: dropped a star because after about a month the date dial stopped working, but company fully refunded me with no need to return the watch."
3.0,Love this thing only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is cause I feel like the ball is too big and it gets caught on long hair too much..
3.0,The look of this necklace is exactly what I have wanted for a long time. Unfortunately my neck turned green after wearing for a couple days. And I take it off for showering.
3.0,"all good except clasp of the puzzle to the ring, broke on both pieces right away"
3.0,"Was Christmas very cute, but longer then normal beanie style hats, and very snug. Just makes someone with short hair look bald almost. But soft and cute."
3.0,"I like the top, however, it's to long."
3.0,"Good fit for my 4 year old (a bit big, but she doesn't mind), good material, but bows fell off almost immediately"
3.0,"Very nice sweater. Sleeves were a tad short for my liking, but will definitely wear!"
3.0,It's a cute dress but I think the material is too heavy for summer. That being said I think it makes a nice fall/winter dress when paired with a cardigan and tights and boots.
3.0,Really cute but they broke after one use. Perhaps better adhesive for sticking the “needle” to the plastic would work best.
3.0,"The feel of the fabric is really nice, however the size is off. The top is extremely tight and had a hard time getting it off and it's pretty long."
3.0,Lose glasses all the time..worth the value if you're like me ?
3.0,"From the reviews I was expecting a bit better quality than the dress I received. It came only marked with the size and no other brand info, the hem line was not even and smelled a little off. You get what you pay for."
3.0,necklace fail apart
3.0,"had to return, loose on my size 8 foot, they where cool thou! They also were not as soft as i would have liked."
3.0,I would have given it more stars but I thought the slot should have been wider the height is excellent .
3.0,Very long would go down I. Size next time . Otherwise it’s cute
3.0,"The charms are nice but the color is very bright like 24k gold will not match with 14k jump rings, bracelets or clasps. My order was missing the letter E. Very disappointed because I needed the E for my project."
3.0,Love my skirts. They fit well and are of good quality. The down side was I recieved the wrong colors.
3.0,Too big. I returned it.
3.0,"Your basic maxi dress, but I was expecting it to come in a wine color and it came in bright red. Pretty disappointed."
3.0,This dress is for the person who has no body bulges. The material is thin and you should order one size larger. Length for 5'4&#34; fit just at the knees.
3.0,"It is beautiful, but I have two owls broaches and two frog broaches in the bag. Missing red bird broach and bee broach."
3.0,"In the photos, you can’t really tell how flowy it is. I’m 5’2, 115 lbs, so it feels like a lot of fabric and because I’ve had three kids, it reminds me a little bit of maternity wear (now girls wear really adorable tight dresses, which was not trendy when I had babies). I’ll keep it and hopefully wear it, if not, I’ll pass it on. It was just OKAY."
3.0,"Front of the suit has a very deep V. Very short torso, mine is much longer. I had to tie fairly tight to cover most of my chest. Skirt is cute and modest. Would buy more from this company."
3.0,Bought a small. Very cute & fitting. Arm holes were a little snug and the neckline was up to my collarbone.  Needless to say I will be returning
3.0,These would have been good quality but I have to return them because they are NOT pink as stated. They are not even what some may consider “ballet pink”. They are completely peach! They won’t even come close to the pink I need for my daughters leotard. I’ve included a picture of the pink I own now and was looking for back up pairs and then a picture of the ones that I bought on here. If they were pink but a shade lighter it would have been fine. But peach? Not so much.
3.0,Not Biggy Smalls. Some other guy. Still cool though.
3.0,I loved this skirt
3.0,"I really like the style of these sunglasses. However, they do not do their job as sunglasses very well. I also experienced problems with the drawstring bag, the string came out of the bag after only five uses. I would not buy this product again."
3.0,"So this dress is cute. There are a couple weird things about it. 1.)the pockets were seen in two very different spots, luckily you can't see this so I'm not worried about it. 2.)The top section of the dress fits a bit funky as well. I can't explain it, I feel like it's oddly shaped. I Also wear the dress with a thin belt and it looks a lot more flattering."
3.0,Very pretty but there is way to much material even when doing a front tuck.  Had to return it.
3.0,"The socks as so comfortable. I also ordered a pair of the 6 pack plain white and plain black.<br />These are soft, warm, and best socks I've worn.<br />They are more thick than their less pricey 6 packs, but one of my socks developed a hole already, see picture. This is disappointing as I wanted to give these socks 6 stars but the Hole in 1 isn't as desirable in socks as it is in golf ;)"
3.0,smaller than I expected ad super clingy. shows off everything
3.0,Fit was fine..but these look huge.Feel comfortable.Will keep just to slog around in at home
3.0,Great color but the flag print feels cheap with a crunchy feeling.  We will see how it holds up in the wash.
3.0,"Definitely not as compressed as the top brands. But in consideration of the price, I would recommend this product. It can provide wind shield and support for legs especially in winter days."
3.0,It worked. But if I had a saw I could have made one for pennies. Way overpaid.
3.0,Love the print but it’s tight in size
3.0,"Cute ring, but too big for a daith piercing. The prongs poked the inside of my ear too much for it to be worn daily. Would be better for a septum."
3.0,"Nice bag. Not made as well as I had hoped, but I do like it for the price. The zipper toggle flew off and I wasn't able to put it back on. Booooo! Still using the bag for beach towels, which works out just fine."
3.0,They are really cute but very hard to click in once in nose and the opening is a little too big so it's sharpe
3.0,very pretty but I thought it came in a pair
3.0,Beautiful! The large butterfly had come off when I received them but was easily replaced.
3.0,"I'm 6'/250 lbs and I ordered the jacket (XL) it fits tight in the chest/stomach regions, I'll use it as motivation to buff up. Pockets on the shell are rather low and small for anything other then car keys. Collar is a little high and tight and the sleeve loops that secure the inner and outer arm sleeves are too small. The zipper is on the, for USA, wrong side. Except for those short comings listed, the design is pretty functional and I'm going to make it work."
3.0,"The bikini is very pretty and the style is exactly as advertised but it was extremely tiny. I am 5’4 and 115 lbs. normally wear an Xs or sometimes S. I ordered the S and the top was okay still a little small but doable. The bottom fit on one leg. It would have fit my 5 year old niece. It’s not because it was a Brazilian cut, it just wouldn’t go up my thighs.  You must order a size up maybe even two."
3.0,"I got a large, It felt like the top fit fine but it was a little too short with really long sleeves.  For the price, the quality isn't bad, but I wish it was a little longer!  For reference, I am 5'6 and 145 pounds, definitely more on the curvy side."
3.0,"Cute shirts and idea. However, our pizza slice was not printed in the direction to show a missing piece but rather facing the other direction. We got lots of compliments for our 5k, however wouldn't order again"
3.0,I have several other crop tanks like this and I felt like this one didn’t fit as great as others. The fabric gaps a bit at the armpit area and doesn’t sit flush with skin. It also seems a bit small. It is supportive though and probably fine to wear underneath a sweatshirt or to sleep in.
3.0,Material is soft but it is made poorly and the buttons are cheesy. I would size down too!
3.0,"Slow shipping, no belt included.  Mostly double-stitched which is good because there are some loose threads.<br /><br />I like the fit and material, zippers function well.  Sizing seems accurate.<br /><br />I paid $17 and would not purchase again at that price, they are now $7 and I am buying another pair as they are worth that much to be sure."
3.0,"Quality is satisfactory, but they are sized on the small side."
3.0,Ordered large. Fits like either xxl or mens size. Way too big.
3.0,"The belt on top is the one that I ordered, and the belt on the bottom is a normal size belt that I thought I was getting. This belt is also very poor in quality. The metal is very thin and could bend easily. The canvas is also very thin and stretched with just one wearing that last only about a minute. I can tell that these belts will fall apart very quickly and easily are in extremely poor quality. The size is actually not true either. This will not fit a man at all unless he is petite.  I'm a 5'5"" woman with average weight, and this belt does not fit me. Definitely not a unisex belt. Very disappointed."
3.0,"The coat is cute but it’s definitely thin and meant more for spring/early fall. It’s difficult to get the straps in the car seat buckled underneath of it. The coat doesn’t lay over the straps very well, it’s bunched up and I end up trying to tuck it around my daughter so it doesn’t bunch up behind her shoulders and head. Not as “car seat friendly” as I had in mind."
3.0,"I bought the 12 month size based on the reviews saying it runs small. I added a photo next to an item that is 6 month size. The arm holes are also different sizes, one is much bigger. I'll probably only use once for photos."
3.0,"Order a a size larger than normal  its a snug fit compared to other brands. I ended up giving it to my wife for pj shirt.  The quality of print and shirt is excellent just wish it would have fit  i wear xl in most brands some L, and i ordered xl to be safe and still  too small."
3.0,I bought larger than normal at it is too tight.  The stretch is there but the entire cut and fabric make it skin tight on top.
3.0,"These pants made my lower half look amazing! The downside is that it has a very controlling control top band. I have a narrow waist and wide hips so, while it fit beautifully around the waist, it was nearly impossible to get them past my hips and thighs. Too bad there was no button or clasp of some kind."
3.0,The quality is just fine but it looks really good
3.0,"These are not sweatpants, despite how they are advertised. They are very thin, they are not cozy fuzzy sweatpants. They are more like a lounge pant. They also ran quite large."
3.0,"order at least one, if not 2 sizes up. I ordered an adult XL and it fits like an adult M/L"
3.0,These earrings are OK but they are not quite what I thought they would be.  The picture makes them appear that they would be bigger than they actually are.
3.0,"Feels well made overall, but if you're planning to run with it I'd look elsewhere. The waist belt material is not made of elastic so it doesn't flex at all, which means it constantly rides up on you as you run until it ends up around your belly button."
3.0,Material is comfortable but tummy band is too narrow. Not very well done
3.0,"These looked cute, but were very thin and a little bit snug. I don’t expect these to last very long."
3.0,"The product's quality is really good and the fabric is very comfortable. However, it didn't bring much support so at the end I can't use it for exercise purposes unless I do something with very low impact such as yoga. I'm a D cup."
3.0,I bought these knowing these were over sized. But these were REALLY over sized. I returned.
3.0,"It is an ok waist trainner. Flexible which allows you to exercise with it, but after 3 day of use wire poke out of corset and bothers skin"
3.0,"This is a cute clutch and everything you can expect for the price. I ordered the red and it's prettier than the picture. I guess this is considered an envelope clutch but it's shaped like a birthday card envelope, square, that a business envelope, rectangle. It's very very flimsy! Don't expect it to hold its shape when carrying without the chain strap"
3.0,"I am 145 lbs with a 36DD chest, so I ordered an XL. It fit, but I think this is more of a shirt for juniors, not women, especially women who are busty."
3.0,"The lights are bright and reasonable well constructed for what they cost. The batteries shipped with them, however, expend their energy in less than an hour or two of solid use (surprising, being that the LED's draw so little juice). The vendor shipped this quickly, which was just in time for the Halloween project I needed them for. Will use again, but with better batteries."
3.0,SO SO THIN
3.0,Ordered a size larger (by 1 size) than I generally wear and even the larger size was not a comfortable fit.
3.0,It is just 26 Oct 2020 and received about 8 inches of snow already in the mountains of eastern Washington.  My hands were cold wearing these gloves.  I used for shoveling and walking the dog.  The fit was a bit small but were comfortable to wear.  Will continue to wear and another test will be wearing while riding Rzr 1000.
3.0,"Really liked the detail of the jacket, but the overall fit was too small."
3.0,While this dress is light and casual the v opening is much too low. Therebshould be avway to close the chect area so it is not exposed.
3.0,"Since the description said women and girls, I hope they'd be somewhat stretchy or adjustable. Be aware they're more women's size. Fit me and 11 year old. Way to big on 6 year old."
3.0,too wide and makes it feel really loose
3.0,They are for my wife
3.0,"I have a fairly small wrist.  When the band is tightened to fit my wrist, the end overlaps onto thye watch face.  I like the band but am returning it for this reason."
3.0,"Pretty top, but Barely can get it fastened although I ordered my usual largest size."
3.0,PROS:  This dress was super cute and came on time.  The material is thick enough you don't have to worry about it being see through.  It was also a great length.<br /><br />CONS:  To small (and I was really sad).  This dress is supposed to fit loosely but it was way too tight and showed every fat roll or imperfection on my body - yes I do have fat rolls and I am working on it;0) .  I used the Amazon size chart to determine what size to buy and if I reorder I am buying a size up.  Seriously.  BUY A SIZE (or maybe two) UP!!
3.0,Too short for my long legs
3.0,"Cute but it's a little annoying to have to unlace and relace every time you put it on or take it off. Plus, the model in the picture must have a very very small neck because it has to be stretched out a lot for me, as someone with a pretty average neck."
3.0,Almost too snug for small size. Snap missing second from the top.
3.0,These are great for little ones who have a hard time with a belt. But two of them broke within the first month.
3.0,I like the shoe but it fits wide on my foot.
3.0,"would have been nice to see what the front looks like, I probably wouldn't have bought it if I knew"
3.0,It's cheap material but does it
3.0,Disappointed in the shade of blue but other than that it’s an excellent buy
3.0,This was not proportional to body - I’ve not worn it yet it’s kinda tight in up top
3.0,Looked like a sweat suit but it isn't... It's very very thin. It's soft and would be okay for a warm spring day but not what I was expecting or looking for. Fit as expected.
3.0,Nice dress pattern just very thin
3.0,My daughter wears these shirts under her TLSO brace. Hands down best shirt to wear underneath brace. Keeps her cool and dry. My only complaint is they do not wash well. Shirt pills after one wash. I wash and hang dry. Disappointing for a t-shirt that costs $40.
3.0,Material is different than the print with the palm leaves. Not what I was expecting
3.0,"Im very disappointed. I absolutely love these dresses. The Meaneor Maxi dresses are my favorites. This order I had a hard time. I never got My maxi dress. I ordered two, Black and Blue at the same time. I only got the black one. It came from china so it took long for the black one to come to me. I got my refund, but I'm still very disappointed. Order one at a time ladies. Avoid my issue. The Black one is amazing tho, so Im still giving it at least three stars. It falls to my ankles. Im 5”2’/46 Bust/39 Waist/50 Hips. I ordered a XXL."
3.0,Way toon small my husband has an athletic build and thick legs and these wouldn't even go up his thighs
3.0,Fit great.<br />Liked the style.<br />I washed these before wearing and the pocket drain grommet fell out leaving a frayed hole.  Contacted seller directly and they took it back immediately.<br />Things happen and I appreciate free returns.
3.0,"Looks better online. There is no pleat at shoulders. Very basic, polyester."
3.0,I like it but it’s already unraveling. I’m 5’10 and 175. It’s perfect and good thing I can sew but you should be carful. It’s very stretchy
3.0,"This umbrella was OK the first few times I used it, but unfortunately one of the spokes broke pretty quickly. I didn't think I'd abused it and was disappointed in that. I really liked the design on it and had hoped it would hold up. After it broke, I opted instead for an off the shelf umbrella from a big box store, and it hasn't disappointed."
3.0,"The box came inside a yellow Amazon package. The package was ripped and the box was open on both ends, although one “less” open than the other. These gloves are not pure white, they’re clear. They may have a white look, but they are unequivocally transparent. They’re thin, but I didn’t try them on because I’m going to return them."
3.0,This are the same size as Harry Potter glasses but as sunglasses… I’m not a fan of the look.
3.0,"...it's a mushy, wrinkly mess.  Is more like a pajama top at that point.  Looked good while it lasted though!"
3.0,Sleeves are shorter than pictured.
3.0,too cheap i will buy another somewhere else
3.0,"They looked good, and were thin enough and stretchy enough to allow full range of movement.  The only downside is that the buttons come off way too easily.  I bought three of these and the buttons on the pockets fell off after two washes.  They need stronger thread for those buttons.<br /><br />Fly zipper works well and I like the multiple pockets."
3.0,A little snug for a size 3X.  I suggest a different style pajama if you need a 2x or 3X.  Very pretty though.  I am still wearing them.
3.0,The elastic band started to get soft less than a year after bying it.  Very disapointed. Would not recommend.  Though the color is acurrate.
3.0,"I debated on how many stars to give this company and actually the scarf was very nice and I received 2 instead of one at a great price. The problem here is that this scarf is not the one I selected. The one I chose was much lighter in color and after I received this scarf I noticed they totally removed the one I had chosen. Also one of the scarfs had a defect in it, looks like a run in the material or flawed where it is missing threads. Luckily the other part was fine. I didn't realize that these were from China and this was a Christmas gift but luckily I did receive it before the estimated delivery date. Wish I could have given them more stars because you are actually getting two scarfs but because of the wrong scarf and the flaw I had to take away two stars. Still extremely cheap."
3.0,"it seems to be real fur, but its sort of a soft fur, but not at all supportive. they said to get a size larger which i did. and while it does fit, its loose. and not that warm when its loose so that is an issue.  the base has soft fur and while it looks like it should be soft, the base has these rubber areas... its not. its very stiff and hard and my feet hurt. i don't do a lot of walking in them, only had them for an hour or two and my feet hurt.<br /><br />my old pair were falling apart and for a long while i made a foam insert with sturdy sheep fur which is quite dense compared to this fluffy stuff. and the fit is better, its warm because my feet are in there a little tighter, and it feels cushioned again.<br /><br />now for $80+ slippers, made in china is kind of an insult because i doubt they were paid that well. further the presentation was terrible. it was a cardboard mailer, that was beat up, and a pair of slippers in a bag. the slippers themselves have no labels that i could find. the size is on the bottom. but the name brand is not there at all.<br /><br />the fur on the sides can be rolled up your ankle giving you a few extra inches if your ankles feel drafty or you don't want to look like a lawn gnome wearing it. i can't speak for overall quality long term because i just got it. if it splits i will update this."
3.0,Thin fabric you much wear something under it. Might work well over a bathing suit
3.0,product is gorgeous however XL was too small
3.0,The band looks great at first but it doesn't last long. After a while the rubber on the sides began to peel off the sides. The best features of the band are the quality rings and the band is nice and thin so the nato/ zulu strap doesn't make your watch sit up to high. I bought it for a black invicta submariner and the look is great.
3.0,Clasp is really cheap...leather seems like it's fake...save your money if you're looking for something well built nd authentic. I gave it 3 stars because aesthetically it is nice looking.
3.0,Really pretty impossible to put in so there good if ya wanna buy something to look at.
3.0,"Fabric is mildly stretchy, fits tight around chest and neck"
3.0,it was bigger than expected
3.0,This is very light weight and short.  Nothing like the picture.
3.0,I love these panties because it's hard to find this style in cotton. The brand could do better with construction though. The elastic pops out and seams come undone after a few wears.
3.0,It's not as long as shown on the pic<br />It's thin
3.0,"Was looking for loose, comfy, knee-length shorts. I like the length and the material, and the looseness in the legs is great. The waistband is much much too tight though. The elastic is thick and hard, and the stitching is scratchy on my skin. Was really hoping to like these :/"
3.0,"I got the blue one.<br />The material is very stiff, and it isn't shiny like the picture make it look. I wouldn't recommend it."
3.0,You say it's adjustale it is not
3.0,"The description was unclear as ""glasses"" is singular and plural.  I had to ask a public question to see how many I was supposed to get. I only got one pair.  There was no way to address a short-ship with the order and had to talk live to someone."
3.0,"It was a little small and additional hooks were ""S"" hooks and very hard to thread through the loops.  Would have been better if they used standard hook/eye."
3.0,Colors are a.little off from the pic.  But ok.
3.0,"I picture sweat pants with fleece inside,  these are just a blended fabric. They are soft though. I am 5'4"", I bought the xl and they are a tad long, so if you are petite, they will be too long."
3.0,"Although I love the width of this belt for wearing with jeans and other pants that have belt loops, I've only worn three or four times and, as you can see from the photo, the tip of the belt is already wearing off.  I'm sure it will continue to lose some of its black cover.  Usually I wear my shirts out, so it is not visible, but I would have expected a lot longer wear out of it.  Anyone who tucks their shirts in will find it unsightly."
3.0,Fall apart easy
3.0,Hat was big and also the face cover and the gloves are small
3.0,I would say its more for ladies then men<br />And no way to bend and hold
3.0,Lousy fly zipper.  Too many gadgets
3.0,Lil short than usual
3.0,"Definitely order only around 2 sizes up if you want it to fit better, but I like mine big.<br /><br />Fabric isn't too thin and it'll definitely keep you warm to some degree!<br /><br />This one delivered about 4 days after order but my Bakugo one will come in about 20 more days which I don't quite understand?Can't wait for my Bakugo one..<br /><br />Edit (a week or later): I bought 3X large, I'm usually just a large, and it drowns my friend who's about 2 sizes smaller than me in the best way possible. Also easy to wash. It has the texture of a swimsuit, I've noticed, but dries quick overnight.<br />Also, my Bakugo one arrived. it says it'll arrive in 10-20 days from now, but it actually arrived yesterday! So perhaps don't trust the shipping dates on these!!<br /><br />6 Months later:<br />there's white stuff on the back of the Bakugo hoodie, which sucks because the hoodie is black, that just won't come off. it's the fabric itself. I think it's teared fabric? I'm taking away a star from my 5 stars because it's annoying to look at. Don't sit on these hoodies for too long because the fabric will have white lint-like stuff on it if you do.<br /><br />Edit 10 months later:<br />Honestly, I didn't wear it all that much and I washed it only twice (by hand). This white stuff is getting everywhere and it's annoying. They're created when a part of the fabric rubs against something too much. Underneath the armpits, the back, and the butt area are the main victims of the fabric tearing. 3 Stars now. It doesn't look good for very long."
3.0,"Runs really, really small.  I can normally wear L/XL but ordered up to a XXL since the material was listed polyester.  Item in XXL seemed to be more of a Medium.  Color and fabric were ok."
3.0,The key chain is sturdy and looks good but the image they post for the product is NOT correct - there is the TITLE logo on the back of the glove at the bottom and there is none in the picture. The logo is very big for the size of the keychain.
3.0,I’ve had this shirt a while and I’m a little disappointed in the quality. The under arm ripped after wearing it maybe 3 times and now a while later and the design has started to peel. Cute! But wasn’t able to enjoy it.
3.0,"the track was not tracked !Watch is not a standard size ,children's!!!The seller did not specify it anywhere!!!"
3.0,"It looked like a fairly inexpensive, simple tank dress when I got it and tried it on.  The material is soft, and the pockets are great.  The leopard pattern is cute, but is really whiter overall than it looks in the picture.  Mostly it didn't look good on me, which is why I returned it."
3.0,To small according to size fast delivery
3.0,They were smaller than I expected but they are lovely.
3.0,"This is a beautiful sweater. That being said; it is oversized, and meant to be loose. I order most thing size large since I don’t like fitted clothes. However, this was way too big. The brand Free People is made loose like this and I wear and X Small. The lower arms are snug but overall it fits. Taking that into account I suggest ordering a size or two smaller than usual."
3.0,"very cute and looks good however, the padding in them move all over and are a horrible fit. Description stated that it would run small but went by t shirt size if you weren't sure order a size up and it is still able 3 sizes too small. But it fits my niece and looks great on here so it wasn't a waste just sad it didn't fit me."
3.0,love this skirt! the material is a little cheap feeling but i get compliments every time i wear it out! super easy to pair with too and adds major color
3.0,I really love these but the earth ones backing is stripped. So disappointing.
3.0,"It's odd because the dress was over all too big, but too small in the sleeves. I had to return."
3.0,"Very cute, like very much. However one did discolor my ear while the other one did not."
3.0,Very cute pyjamas but my grandson is an average 10-year old and the size 16-18 is way too small for him.  They will also need to be washed first as they have a very odd odor to them.
3.0,Nice looking if u switch out often or for events but not for daily wear. The color of metal changes n makes ur skin green.
3.0,Good quality. Just like image online. However is not an XL womens. Going to try XXL. Is a gift & recipient prefers big & roomy for sweatshirts.
3.0,tight at the bottom
3.0,They're absolutely beautiful but the diamonds in the earrings move. They stay in well but that could be a cause of concern.
3.0,I didn’t care for the different shades of orange in the two fabrics. They didn’t go together well in my opinion. Also was disappointed in quality and sizing so I returned it. No problems with return.
3.0,Seemed to run rather large.
3.0,Too small and not what I thought it was.
3.0,Las plumas venían cayéndose no estaban bien pegadas y se ve el cartón yo tuve que componerlo para que se viera mejor
3.0,Shorter than expected !
3.0,"These are not as thick as I thought they would be on my tennis shoes, but are OK."
3.0,Took awile but wasn't aware they were coming from overseas. Took longer than was told to me when I bought them
3.0,Super thin material and snags easily. Definitely sized for a small child
3.0,"They where kinda too big , but there cool earrings"
3.0,"It's was a bit small for what i needed it for, since my wallet is a bit bulky for it and not enough space to fit any other simple necessities. It can be use for personal essentials within a bigger bag, or for small essentials and nonessential items to carry by itself."
3.0,Does job  but a  it too long
3.0,"This can be worn on any occasion paired with the right attire. I like wearing it, very attractive. With the leather strap avoid water to preserve the strength."
3.0,"Like the robe, hate that it has no loops to hold the belt if you don't tie it around your body the belt just falls"
3.0,Great drop protection and slim tight fit. Had couple replaced through manufacture. But they keep changing color. Only the soft rubbery part. Showed some pics. I bought mine when they were pre order. Tried oxy to remove with no luck.
3.0,Material and look is average.
3.0,Comfortable. Just somewhat small.
3.0,"Nice, bought the wrong size. Giving it away as a gift."
3.0,Very cheap material....you get what you pay for. I ordered a medium and it was true to size. Also the print was off center and just felt weird to me. I returned this item but overall it's not bad for the price.
3.0,"Colors in the pictures are misleading. I purchased the purple/green color combo and it's not even close to the pictures, they are actually purple and gold with just a tiny hint of green. That said, they do fit me well and they are lightweight, really comfortable."
3.0,"Looks more gray in photos, but to me the gray (which when ordering looked darker/more charcoal) looks blueish purple in person.  Very soft and like a thin fleece. Just wish the color was better."
3.0,Worn as a shirt...def too small for my long legs
3.0,"Had to reglue to stand.  However, it is one of the only minis for this monster available."
3.0,Its not what I thought its already broken
3.0,"I would have loved to have taken photos in it, but there was no wearing it. At 5’1 and 220 I can comfortably wear a 2X that states 20-22 US but this was a different story. I would love to exchange it but this was the only style that had the 20-22 size. Luckily I have a great friend who can sew and we will be adding stretchy panels to each side so I can wear it. I will update once the alterations are done! Thank goodness the frantic can take it!"
3.0,"Fits as expected, great price but not as good on compression."
3.0,They are cute. Smaller than I thought they were going to be. And the post are kind of wide and hurt my ears since I’m used to wearing skinny post earrings...
3.0,wasn't as long as depicted in photo.
3.0,"The sole of the shoe was cheaper than expected. However, it is still a cute sandal."
3.0,needs ironing
3.0,"Not bad fit, but still not quiet perfect, okay until you eat and sit for long periods of time, maybe its just me."
3.0,"They are very pretty but very large, I mean dangling on your shoulder and all around  huge. I like dainty earrings."
3.0,It's very thin. The breathable material makes me wonder if the valve actually filters anything.
3.0,Too tight on crotch area
3.0,I’m usually a size 2x but this jacket didn’t close at all it was still cute just need to size up
3.0,I gifted this to my mother . And it was alright words were really small and I didn’t like that you can change out the chain if wanted to
3.0,Ordered my shirt and it was about a size to small. Used the sizes on my other shirts for reference. Should have better sizing chart.
3.0,Color was lighter than shown in picture and the leggings were blemished. I returned.
3.0,The color wasn't what I had expected but it was fine. Handles started shedding on the side.
3.0,It's a cheap watch but it's okay
3.0,"They can be very tight and this is not so good for circulation. Judging from my use of them if you go a size larger than what you would expect you'll probably get all the compression you want without the false impressing that they may be cutting off your circulation,"
3.0,it's good nice wallet but not good for actual use it's more of a showpiece. you can use it as wallet but the threads will come out and it will rip.
3.0,"I've loved this suit from afar for so long and I'm so disappointed that it's too small. It's definitely for a smaller, petite, small busted woman. I'll unfortunately have to return.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the seller nor am I obligated to leave positive feedback. All statements are true and 100% my own based on my personal usage of the product."
3.0,Cute but way too big. I bought to fit 3-6months but I’ll have to save this for when she is 2-3yrs old
3.0,"Very pretty, however very light weight. I like to sleep with my sterling chain around my neck, I didn’t feel comfortable wearing this. I thought it would break the first time I turn from side to side"
3.0,"I had ordered two of these in the same size (for my mom and i) and one pair was slightly smaller then the other. I did really like them though, and they aren't too uncomfortable even though the one size was a little small (i gave the bigger ones to my mom).<br />The little carrying case also came in handy."
3.0,Material is good. I bought a medium but it fits like an Extra large. Tried to return it and was Told it would Cost me $201 to ship back.
3.0,"If your piercing sits lower in your nose and/or your upper lip is short, this may hang too low for you. Unfortunately I have both a low piercing and short lip. It looks too big and unwieldy on me. It's easy to get in and out and looks like the picture."
3.0,It is very pretty.  The color is great.  The material is rough and not comfortable with sensitive skin.
3.0,It’s a very boxy cut and wrinkles easy
3.0,The lens were still to dark to wear inside and outside. A little on the big side as well.
3.0,"The fit is fine but the chains aren't attached properly and theyou keep bursting. I bought it for the chain style, a bit disappointed that everytI me I want to wear the pants chains keep getting detached"
3.0,"Someone that has a Milwaukee jacket, heated.<br />How would I compare the two? Start with the sleeves. They are not adjustable. Great if you wear heavy gloves I assume. Milwaukee jacket has adjustable sleeves which make them tight around your wrist or loose. The hoodie on the Ridgid jacket is a plus. Does not have an in her pocket.Milwaukee jacket a sticker and more for work. Has an inner pocket.  Ridgid jacket is a light jacket. Comfortable but for the money by the Milwaukee.<br />Showed it to the guys on site today. They agree with my assumption opinion"
3.0,"The charm itself is nice, but it comes on a crappy chain! You can change it out and it will look awesome! Gave as a gift, the person said they liked it...LOL?!"
3.0,Although this looks nice. I think it’s too big and chain not long enough
3.0,"So I bought this for neck pain because it's cheaper than buying disposable heat pads. It does a pretty good job of soothing the aches in my vertebrae after I've been at the computer for a long time. I also managed to lose the charging cable within a day, and break the power supply within a week--not the manufacturer's fault, accidents on my side. The good news is that it's compatible with just about any portable power supply of equivalent wattage, and if you're lucky you can find one in a smaller size than the one that comes with the scarf (and with a more standard charging cable type).<br /><br />This brings me to the one downside, though. I did replace the power pack with a smaller one, but even with that it's still lopsided and unwieldy, constantly dragging to the side the power pack is on from the unevenly distributed weight.<br /><br />Also just as a safety warning: do not leave this thing unattended on flammable surfaces. You'd think it would be safe considering it's inside fabric so it must not be a fire hazard. You'd be wrong. I left it plugged in to charge on my bed, and forgot to turn it off. Came back five hours later to a black scorch mark on the white sheets, where the central heating element (not the power pack) had been resting against it through the fabric of the scarf. With the original power pack, too--this wasn't from the new power pack overloading it or anything. Scared the crap out of me, and I will not be leaving this thing plugged in and turned on for more than an hour at a time. Yes, it was partly my fault for forgetting to turn it off--but considering I also use the scarf for many hours at a time, I shouldn't feel that it's unsafe to have it against my skin or clothing for multiple hours for fear of burns."
3.0,They are bigger than 14 G and kinda heavy definitelynot an everyday wear
3.0,Feels stiff while wearing. Color was not as pictured.  Have not worn it for extended periods so can not review the durability.
3.0,"I would have liked this in a medium, but the large was enormous on my frame (5’4, size 10)."
3.0,"I had read some reviews of this being too short for knee length, but I guess didn't realize it would be THIS SHORT. If i was looking for a shirt this actually fits very nicely with shaping the chest section then flowing down, without looking too bag-like. Unfortunately its too short for me to wear with leggings and I think it would fall right with wearing jeans& a belt, so it will be returned! If you are okay with your butt showing/ using it as just a top then I'd go for it! (I'm 5'6&#34; and wearing a medium in the blue color, its a very gorgeous color in person!)"
3.0,"The model doesn't do this tankini any justice. I absolutely loved the color & fabric however, the plunge was too deep and it made my breasts look like they would fall out or like the straps would pop. It was comfortable and flattered the bottom half but my breast were no match for the plunge... I'm sure it would look fantastic on someone that didn't have large breasts like I do."
3.0,"A bit small for an XL, can't say I wear these that much, there are other options."
3.0,"Purse is beautiful,  Smaller than i figure it would be."
3.0,"The Amazon item Picture does NOT match the product.  The picture has a small chest logo.  The delivered item has a 6"" X 8"" large Logo in the middle of the chest.<br />.<br />It does however appear to be a genuine Realtree item: the fabric is properly marked with their Realtree edge logo embedded in the pattern, and the fit and finish is good.  The fabric is a mid-weight polyester and sturdier than I expected.  The stitching is excellent.  The stress areas at the pocket are attached solidly.  Overall it seems to be an well made sweatshirt/hoodie thing, excepting the Logo issue.<br />.<br />The XL size I ordered is dead-on.  Almost all XL camo-clothing shirts and jackets I have ordered fit me slightly loose, and the sleeves are about 1/2 too long.  I like them this way so I can layer under, and have it completely cover my waistline when sitting.<br />.<br />I ordered several and will keep them all...  (IMO, I like this edge pattern. It doesn't look like a blob of brush from 100 yards)."
3.0,"The seems nice though a bit inexpensive looking. The photo on Amazon shows it nicer. The zippers and such could be better, I think they will break or discolor/rust quickly. The bottom part is disappointingly cheap looking. The price is also higher compared to the quality."
3.0,I'm giving 3 stars because of the size difference. I LOVED this shirts design. I bought a 3t for my kid and it looked like an 18 month shirt. I now purchased a 6t and am hoping for better results.
3.0,Really like the fabric/design of pant but way too tight and short :(  size chart needs to show length as well as waist. Would love to reorder
3.0,"According to the sizing chart I would fit an XL (bust 114&#34;) but it was too tight around the chest.  Liked the feel but unable to wear it, Had to return it."
3.0,Did not support  me at all in any impact sport activity.  I wear a 36C regularly and this stretched out too much.
3.0,The band is thin and doesn’t stay tucked in to the leather bands. Not that pleased with the purchase
3.0,The shirt is cute but too tight in the arms. Being too tight in the arms causes it to bunch weird across the chest. Definitely size up if considering this.
3.0,"I am typically someone who wears an XL in Hoodies/Sweatshirts but after reading other reviews I decided to go up x2 sizes and I'm glad or else the hoodie would have been tight, skin tight.  The material is great.  It is soft and cozy, but when I order a 3x from other places, I'm usually swimming in it.  This one is great in the chest and stomach area (I could go down a to the XL size there) but the arms are not snug, but they probably will be after the first wash.<br /><br />For this reason, I have to give it a 3*<br /><br />The material 5*<br />The Color/Pattern 5*<br />Size 2*"
3.0,I thought I was getting 2 and instead I got one what good is one when most people have two shoes to stretch out
3.0,Shorter than I expected. Nice cutout size. Nice material.
3.0,Not the best quality of tie overall.  You really get what you pay for.
3.0,Cute tanks. Shrank to about a size 8 and I ordered the 14-16 size.
3.0,"This sweater top (very light weight) was too small in the small size, especially around the neck. I exchanged it for a medium. FYI, I'm 5'4"", 126 lbs, 36B"
3.0,Needs a slip under it. It's thin material. The stings on the front makes it look weird but its a nice dress.
3.0,I am a large man whom XL usually fits. In this case I could not get it past my shoulders
3.0,"Its ok, but does not look like the picture shown in advertisment."
3.0,"I expected to have a finer finished, but I like how it looks"
3.0,Item was not as pictured the top of the hat was only 4 inches over the brow of the hat and looks more like a bowler hat due to the height of it ...still has a flat top......would cost more to return so will make do.......Wen in doubt ask for dimensions before you buy
3.0,The flowers aren’t sewn together as closely as they look in the description but it’s still cute.
3.0,"These tights were marked as adult but they're very small.  They seem to be thick and good quality, so if they do fit you it looks like you'd get good use out of them."
3.0,I washed and hung these two dry prior to review. They are smaller than I expected. Too small. Well-made of quality fabric. Made in China. I hope you find this review helpful.
3.0,I usually wear an 8 1/2 W or sometimes a 9 Reg. These run very wide and a little large. I would reorder an 8.5 Reg but I am kinda mad at them that they charge a fee to return them! We’re talking almost one hundred dollar slippers! Rip off!
3.0,"Cheap to buy and cheaply made. Finish is OK, there is a weird &#34;bump&#34; on the wrist that appears to be intentional but feels a bit awkward. All of the fingers are the same length, so the pinky finger is a bit too long and partially covers the knuckle. But they do keep your hands warm without interfering with your dexterity, and they are affordable enough to be practically disposable."
3.0,"Tried them on, said oh no, how can a mans large be too tight....I bought them for around the house....pockets in back on butt...stick out...not shown in pictures.  But they streched  !!!!  I don't know how a 'man' can wear these....not at all masculine"
3.0,"These earrings are so cute and are a great price. However, they arrived with the posts bent. One was so bad that I tried to bend it back enough so I could wear it and the post came unattached."
3.0,It worked for what it was for which was to wear as the base to a full length shear jacket type item I got from another store. But I would NEVER where it by itself. Too thin
3.0,everything went black gold / ugly / poor quality.
3.0,"This is my second watch the first the blue version of this watch which I love the color.<br /><br />I was a little less satisfied with this watches delivery.  It arrived with the watch on so of course I assume I'll be replacing the battery soon.  And also the top dial milli-seconds is off(see photo), however it's not sometime that would cause me to return it.<br /><br />Overall though I like the band thickness, the weight of the watch(many watches at this price point look good but you pick them up and there light as a feather and feel cheap.  This watch has a decent weight to it) and the face which stands out."
3.0,This was purchased for my daughter and she loves it but its a little too revealing and the material is very thin making it see through in some areas. I won’t let her wear this in public anymore!
3.0,"I liked it a lot but I paid far more than what it was worth. I should have paid half. It fits my phone and a few very small things, and couldn't also fit in my wallet! I should have stopped myself from buying this."
3.0,"I took a chance buying these sweatpants purely based on the photo, and still sized up from my normal small to a medium. In person they look like a different pair of sweats compared to the picture on Amazon, and they definitely run small. They aren't as high waisted as I hoped, but they are a nice soft material and I will still wear them. I just wish the fit wasn't as snug."
3.0,"They're longer than I expected, so they don't fit in my lip well and one of them broke while I was wearing it. Packaging was nice, but I would not by this product again."
3.0,"Great looking, comfortable, and stylish. Limited durability. Good price."
3.0,As a parent I loved this product however the person for which it was intended wanted absolutely nothing to do with it. Now we all know that a good wetsuit will help keep you buoyant but the caveat to that is “only if you wear it”. So if your boy or girl has fears of sinking in open water then I would recommend this product to you because it will help keep them afloat. If you are unsure what size to purchase then buy one or two sizes higher- they can always grow into it.
3.0,It’s a nice dress but not really what I was expecting. The color is off.
3.0,Not as long as pictures.
3.0,1. Totally wrong color! The one I ordered was an olive heathered green and this is like camel brown.<br />2. It fits but not at all like in the picture. I wear a med/small in most things and the arm length and body length is not at all like the oversized look in the photo. But if I get bigger I fear it will be just body and not longer.
3.0,Pretty but disappointed about the fit.  If you’re a small like me then get the XL to somewhat resemble the picture
3.0,Make sure you size up when ordering.
3.0,Material is pretty good a bit on the light side but the arms are huge in relation to the torso
3.0,"Fabric is nice, but size was way off"
3.0,Not exactly what i expected ... as what i received by no way looks like what's on the model.
3.0,Did not like material!
3.0,These were perfect for a kindergarten hoe down for an end of the school year program. My child really liked them and was comfortable wearing them. My only complaint are the straps to adjust are not that easy and the strap isn’t sewn to the overalls so I fixed  this issue by using a safety pin to pin the straps together and make it stay in place.
3.0,Really cute Easter outfit but was unfortunately too big.
3.0,O-ring too small and weak but perhaps I didn’t understand sizing
3.0,The rhinestones came out!
3.0,I liked the fit of this top but had to send it back because there was a noticeable blue stain.
3.0,it came on the day that was posted. it was everything that I expected.<br />I will be ordering three more for my family.
3.0,"I really liked the look of this wallet as it was very flat in the picture, but in person it had a number of design flaws.<br />The coin purse inside has no accordion sides so it really only holds a few coins. The flatness of the design is not helped by the large snaps that add extra thickness. The leather is fine quality and might be very durable, but its not particularly soft or supple. Last but not least, having to unsnap two snaps every time you want to get into the wallet is a bit of a nuisance.<br />Taking those comments into consideration, I still think it could be a good choice for somebody who doesn’t carry around many coins, a fairly typical thing these days, and someone for whom the thinness is not a huge factor.<br />The minimalist design is quite attractive."
3.0,"For reference I am 5'2, 135lb and wear a size small or 4/6 regularly. I really love the cut of this dress, however, the middle section is just a bit too tight for my personal liking. Without wearing one of those shape-wear things (which I don't own) every line, wrinkle, bump, etc will show. I'm pretty fit, not overweight in the least and it still made me self-conscious. Some people may be more comfortable wearing such a form fitting dress but it was not for me."
3.0,"This dress was without a doubt beautiful. It's exactly as pictured. It's true to size. However- it rode up with every step I took lol. Now If I was going to the club, perhaps it wouldn't matter as much 😂 (jk) but I was on a romantic date night with my husband and I felt self conscious all night having to pull it down constantly."
3.0,"I really didn't find them helpful at all, however my vision in general is terrible.  I did keep them because the case they came in was worth keeping."
3.0,Completely see through and really cheap material.
3.0,High quality knit but the buttons are to small so the outfit always comes undone. We really want to like this outfit so we are going to put bigger buttons on it.
3.0,"I bought the 4t for my four year old who is just now starting to enter size 4 fully expecting it to be a bit big in the waist but knowing the length would be appropriate because she's tall-- no problem. The 4t was EASILY the size of her 6t outfits in storage. IT'S HUUUUUUGE. So I sent it back and ordered the 2t (which would have come in on xmas eve and no backup option-- not their fault but nerve wracking).<br /><br />The 2t comes in xmas eve and it's also HUUUUGE on my daughter. I had to check several times to make sure they didn't send me the 4t again-- nope, it was marked 2t but wasn't any smaller than the 4t. Please order like 3 sizes smaller than your child wears and have a backup outfit. This is beautiful but we had to return even the 2t for it being too big."
3.0,It's okay.  My husband said I look like a lamp shade when I showed it to him.  It looks better online.  I am 38D so it makes me look larger than I am.  Maybe better for someone with a smaller chest.
3.0,"Definitely Not as photo...<br />Extra large top<br />But small bottom, it doesn't fit in butt area..."
3.0,"didn't fit like the other pair i bought, they slip off a lot, which make the annoying for me and my daughter"
3.0,The color assortment are beautiful. But the material is very thin.
3.0,i never received the little purse attached to it.
3.0,Well you definitely can’t dry these after they are washed because they will shrink. Also the shirt is very short. The pants get super stretched out. But I think that’s just the way they make pajamas. Eh we wore them many times but she grew out of the shirt very fast.  We don’t even wear the shirt anymore but the pants are still alright.
3.0,Very nice bracelet but it would have been better if its adjustable. It wears too loose in  my hands but still a great bracelet
3.0,"Love this cute affordable bracelet, but it's nearly impossible to put on without help!  It's extremely frustrating, it also came apart on the first day but was extremely easy to fix."
3.0,"I loved the feel and pattern of the skirts, but they were about six inches too long.  Also, the waist and hip sections were looser than I anticipated."
3.0,Not as warm as I expected but otherwise it’s a nice looking cap
3.0,"I was excited to receive this dress but when it came found that I was disappointed. While the dress itself is very comfortable to wear, the material is a stretchy shiny polyester material that is very thin (fortunately, it is lined) and doesn’t look very nice close up.<br /><br />The dress was also quite large. My measurements are exact to size chart’s medium, so that’s what I got, but found it was too big, especially in the chest area (and I’m a 34c/32d!) part of the issue may have been my height. I am only 5’0”, so perhaps the dress would have fallen differently had I been taller, but as it was, the entire dress was simply too large—and not just too long, which I did expect."
3.0,"My husband is chubby, not big boned or extra tall. The legs on the plus sizes are somewhat longer than the average sizes. Thus, he needs to have them hemmed about two inches."
3.0,"The shirt is nice, material is nice.  Fits a little big but that's ok.  The only thing is it is hard to get the wrinkles out.  What's up with that?  I bought 2 and it's the same in both.  Maybe I need to use a hotter setting on the iron."
3.0,Cute shirt! The stitching around the bottom of the shirt fell out after the second wash. I still wear it though as it don’t look bad!
3.0,It's nice to wear when you don't want to wear a real bra.
3.0,"The shirt itself came wrinkled and not straighten out but i guess that’s what you expect from shipping. Im 5’4 around 200Ibs purchased L and it was quite small and snug, would recommend going a size up. The graphic picture seems cheaply placed on."
3.0,Slow shipping<br />Very Low quality<br />3 stars for warming your feet in style
3.0,"Pockets are almost too low to use. Doesn't look like the same cut as the item advertised, maybe the model is wearing a small and the whole dress is shorter and hangs different?"
3.0,"I laid this shirt out flat on my bed to get an accurate picture. The design is great I love the rainbow lettering and the neckline. However, the cut of the shirt is a little odd. You can see from my picture it is an A-line shape from the armpits to the hemline. This is weird. I was expecting more of a loose flowy fabric and fit.<br /><br />This shirt is more of just a typical unisex tee fabric in this strange cut. It's ok by me because the pattering is cute enough I will just tie the hem for a better fit.<br /><br />One last thing to note: the shirt had a really odd vinegar smell out of the package. I assume that is the dye. I went ahead and washed it and can no longer smell it, so I think it will be fine. Just plan to wash it asap. Also order down if you want a body con fit."
3.0,Could have been a lot better for the price
3.0,I didn’t like the fact that this was an iron on decal. Bought this for a friend. I have the same design but mine is not iron on.
3.0,I bought these in size 1 to fit my 3-6 month old and she is just now able to fit into them at 9 months. I would say size 1 is closer to a size 2 so size down. Otherwise the quality is good and they look just like the photo
3.0,"Does not fit as described, also looks to be shorter and definitely see thru...I ordered a charcoal color wouldnt have expected see thru in that"
3.0,For the price it was okay.  Would have given another star but the rune was actually attached sideways and looked ridiculous.  I returned it.  I only needed it for a costume party that week so didn't reorder.  Maybe you will have better luck.
3.0,"As soon as I opened the package, one of the bird's stones fell out of it. I had to ask for a refund. I liked the looks of it before that, though. I'm giving it three stars instead of one because maybe mine was just defective, but I also guess you get what you pay for. It the stone wouldn't have fallen out, it would've been okay for the price."
3.0,"It's very nice, but the center is crooked. I still wear it and like it."
3.0,There’s no size chart
3.0,My girlfriend is 5'2 132lbs. I got her a medium and it was really big on her.
3.0,"I love these rings and this design. I have black, pink and grey. I thought from the picture this would be more of a plum color but it was bright purple.  I sent it back with no issues."
3.0,"Love the design, andI thought was real leather, but is not. The price was reasonable so I will stay with the bag."
3.0,Loved what worked but half didn’t even light up
3.0,The cut is little awkward
3.0,Its an OK product<br />size is a little off
3.0,They are pretty had the outfit for them seen they were jelly shoes I'm an 81/2 and got a 9 and were still too small!
3.0,Too small and too bulky.
3.0,I don’t like the material. It’s foesnt match the style of the blazer.
3.0,"Cute shoes, but the size runs small I wish I would of ordered one size up, too much of a hassle to return"
3.0,Love this shirt and the color but this shirt did not stay on the shoulders at all.
3.0,"Ok so I have given these tanks 5 star , and workout wise , Material wise They are fantastic this is the 6th time I’ve bought them and now 3 times in a row I order double X and get triple X. You order double X and they truly are 1 X Fit so I have no clue what’s going on with the company but the shirts are way way to big if they continue to give me triple X and I ordered doubleX ... I also haven’t opened them and set them aside so I’m just now finding out. Open up the package so you know your getting what you bought. This was my previous review This workout shirt is all I wear to the gym 6 days a week, I’ve probably bought well over 20 pair. It’s the best out there and I’ve tried them all. Just remember if your a large get an xl because it’s definitely a tight fit. I’m an xl so the I order the double xl and it fits just right."
3.0,"I searched for a small tux for a toddler and settled on this one. I was a little disappointed to open the package and see the material looked like heavy duty pajamas. It did not look like a regular suit. It was comfortable for the toddler though, and he wore it all day."
3.0,"This belt is good, but very short!"
3.0,"I measured my hand just as it said and the gloves I received were too small. I really liked the look of them, but didn't trade for a larger size because I ordered my husband a different pair and loved his."
3.0,It was cute but way too short! The chest area was a tad tight- but the print and style is very cute!
3.0,"The hate is a bit too floppy.  The canopy part is too large and flops around (by the way: this is very cute), but then the part intended to secure around the head is actually not deep enough so it doesn't tighten and stay on.  The wind catches the floppiness of the hat and easily pulls it off.  I have tightened the drawstring as much as I can and its still not snug.  To me, I think the issue is depth.  It's a cute hat and very protective but not a great design."
3.0,Should have ordered a size larger.  We ordered in the size he normally wears and when he sits down while wearing these the leg parts dig in
3.0,"i would give a 5, but like 10 kept opening. : /"
3.0,its herringbone dark grey with 8 pannels. it doesn look like that on the photos so.. it has two snap buttons on the brim. it fits well but it doesn have hugging feelin around ur head. so it might blow away when the wind gets a bit wild.
3.0,Cute dress. Fit well. Fabric was a little odd.
3.0,Fit as expected and are actually pretty comfortable. I agree with other reviews that they have a chemical type odor but it is not over powering. The cost of these shoes is fairly low and it shows in the quality of the materials used.
3.0,colors are not as vibrant as pictured...
3.0,Their L is like a XXL...I returned. Quality is good for the price and I would have kept it had it fit.
3.0,"I really wanted this for a cosplay I was meaning to do so I got these. It arrived in 2 days which was great! There was a small problem with the shipping address but it fixed itself somehow?? I didn't have time to contact them and when I did, it had said my package had already arrived lmao. I was worried it might be bent or scratched since the best protection it had was the plastic it was wrapped in, but it was okay! I chose a medium me having a large head but it was very big. On pictures it looked fine but wouldnt go outside with them. Listen to everyone and order a small if you are afraid of it being too big. I will be ordering again a small since refeunds are too much of a hassle for me.<br />Overall quality: 10/10"
3.0,Cute skirt top not so cute . I’ll wear skirt but trash top.
3.0,I love the design and it’s just the right size. I am disappointed that it smelled extremely musty. I’m allergic to mold and it gave me an asthma attack. I sprayed it down with Lysol and wiped to with Clorox wipes. We will see how that works.
3.0,"The quality of this luggage cover seemed okay at first glance, however there is not a buckle on this item as shown in the listing, there is only a zipper. The medium was too small and the large was too big for both my 20"" and 23"" cases."
3.0,"Very pretty and did its one day purpose. Would have love to use again, but diamonds started falling off like the wind"
3.0,They are ok...cant really tell they are olive
3.0,These are super cute but on the small side! Only one of the patterns was large enough for me (an adult) to wear comfortably over my eyes.
3.0,They're ok. About 8 inches too short came to just below the knee. Would b great if u suffer from dwarfism.
3.0,This are extremely comfortable for the price! However they are definitely not squat proof so not made for a leg day for sure.
3.0,I love love the dress i got mainly cause its just cute and i love the color i got 6-12mth size for my six mth old ....omg its so big it won't fit my daughter til shes like a year or more but at least I'll be able to eventually use it
3.0,"Super cute , hurts the inner toe area and is small"
3.0,mom likes them.!
3.0,"The beanie itself is great, but the material used to create the mustache could be of a better and thicker quality."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this swimsuit but it didn’t fit me right at all. I’m taller and it seemed to be too tight length wise. I read other reviews and ordered a bigger size based on that. Was easy to return so that was nice. Bummed it didn’t fit me.<br />I gave 3 stars because it was great material and design, fast shipping and easy to return."
3.0,"They are soft, and I like the material, but the pants are high waisted, which I'm not a fan of."
3.0,"I followed the manufacturer suggestion to ignore Amazon size chart and follow theirs.  I would normally wear a medium/size 10 but went with the large because of the measurements they provided.  The dress was a bit loose all around but the shoulders were definitely too wide and look weird.  I am going back to a medium, which might be slightly snug around the middle, but the fabric was somewhat stretchy so it will be fine."
3.0,More of a swim cover up. Pretty see through. But light & comfortable
3.0,Extra large is seriously not any bigger than the small. Cute but it's NOT for women with big boobs.
3.0,Magnetic septum pieces get wild and start pointing different directions or just go up your nose. Other pieces were fun!
3.0,"Did not hold all of my hair. It is a really soft made material, but it just wasn't large enough."
3.0,Very pretty but the pearls were larger than I would have liked
3.0,"I like the color of this dress, but the fabric was not soft enough to lay nicely. It fit really well (for reference, I'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds). I ended up giving it to my sister and she loves it! I guess it works for some and not for others."
3.0,"I just laid this skeleton out on its back on a table.  Head to heel, it measures 32&#34;.  The skull is a little under 3&#34; dia. left to right, about 4&#34; dia. front to back.  The bones are all made of a fairly heavy, hard plastic.  Good and solid; NOT lightweight plastic.  More like real bone.  It is more realistic than I expected.<br /><br />The legs fell off immediately; the hardware holding it together is flimsy.<br /><br />From the Amazon listing here, I had no idea what the size of this would be.  The product dimensions given are for the bag it comes in, folded up.<br /><br /> I bought this to be a stage prop.  I expected it to be smaller than life-size.  This is MUCH smaller.  About proportional for a two-year old child, I would say.<br /><br />I would give this four stars, I think, if I had known the size ahead of time.  Overall great, but minus one for falling apart instantly.  In this case, minus one more star for providing me with no idea what size to expect."
3.0,Pretty!<br />Extremely large! Need a magnifying glass to read instructions!<br />Not worth the money! Paying for name only!!!
3.0,LOVE these because they are Sheilas BUT one of the stems on mine was bent upon arrival.
3.0,It's okay but the hat is too small. The gloves are ok.
3.0,Weird fit. Really ong and doesn't really hug to the curves like one would hope. Kind of has its own shape.
3.0,Dress is comfortable but just a bit snug in the hip area
3.0,Most reason I bought was the Velcro strap. No Velcro strap :( I have small narrow feet so the strap is loose :(
3.0,It arrived with one of the stones off the bracelet. We had to glue it back in.
3.0,"Seems hand made which is cool Inexpensive. Came quick. but small, seems like it's made for women, kids or small men. material is not great. it's a little like yoga pants material or something like that not quick dry type material. not ideal for hot weather or if you work outside makes my neck and face sweat hard. it does have a pocket for a filter so that's a plus"
3.0,Material not what I wanted.
3.0,"I couldn't wear it as it was tiny, both small and short.  I like a longer yoga style fit."
3.0,I didn't know how much I hated silver jewelry until this necklace.
3.0,Looks gorgeous but super uncomfortable.
3.0,"I have never been able to wear it, and the hurricane came so I couldn't return in time, but it is beautiful, I wish they would put not true to size on clothes that run smaller"
3.0,Bought these to wear under pants...they slid down to my ankles in just a few minutes...so they are no use for me..quality is nice and my ankles were very warm all day...
3.0,Cute but kind of short and small..... Fabric and embroidery is pretty!
3.0,"The shades on it are lighter than I expected.  They fit well and look nice, but they don't block out the piercing sun's ray while driving."
3.0,"Arrived late, the band is too tight for the larger wrist.  I have a size 8 wrist and it is too small. Needs to be just a tad bit larger for a comfortable fit."
3.0,"This is a nice little pack. I tested out all of the features on a trip that included rain, hail, snow, sun, altitude, lakes, valleys...basically everything. It held up for the most part. Outdoor Vitals claims that this pack is waterproof, but it comes with a pack cover. I can say with 100%  confidence that this pack is totally waterproof. We got caught in some crazy weather and I did not use the pack cover (all of my down was in dry bags just in case) and NOTHING inside got wet. I was definitely impressed. The zippers are well covered and not weak spots like I had originally thought and the fabric was durable and let nothing by. I like that the brain is removable and turns into a fanny pack. This is reminiscent of the Osprey packs and is definitely useful. The hip pockets are removable to make the pack lighter and the ice ax/hiking pole holders do their job. The side zipper is really nice in theory, but I would up not using it at all because I had a bear canister. I imagine if I didn't have to worry about bears my experience may be different, but I did not find it useful when I used the pack.<br />Now the downside...this pack is very adjustable, but seriously to the point where it was too adjustable. I found that all of the straps kept slipping and would not carry the weight on my hips. This strained my neck, shoulders and back instead of carrying the load appropriately. In 6 miles, I had to stop about 2 times each mile to readjust, which became both painful and annoying. I also would have preferred two pockets on the front rather than one extremely large one.<br />That being said, this pack will be absolutely perfect for my smaller cousin who will not be carrying much weight when we backpack. I believe that this will alleviate the stress on the straps and prevent slippage and will also be a good size for her because of the adjustments."
3.0,"It doesn't allow you to adjust the straps short enough, the concept is good but the execution could be a lot better for adjusting length."
3.0,The clasp broke very quickly.
3.0,These leggings are very comfortable and when you run they stay in place and don't fall down. I am 5'2 and where a Large in pants. The bottoms flare out on the calf. Not really made for short people.
3.0,Sexy and you know it
3.0,"I had never used this brand before, They are silicone and comfortable. The stem is a tad long but it is easy to trim down if you need to.  They are more comfortable than the foam disposables and more convenient than ear muffs. I'm not sure I can tell any significant difference in the &#34;noise cancelling&#34; ability between these and the foam plugs however. I feel like it blocked loud noises better than lower noise. I could still hear the tv and my husband talking when using them. They didn't perform quite as I had hoped. Good customer service."
3.0,The size chart is misleading. Need to be adjusted for the dresses.
3.0,"I like these dresses but they are low quality and must be washed in a bag on delicate cycle because the stitching will just unravel. plus they charged $16 for shipping, which was an unexpected cost at the very end."
3.0,The key thing broke after a while of using it and the letters began to fade quick after a couple weeks of first having it.
3.0,"Shirt is super cute. I bought a large since it was the only size it said was available but got delivered a Medium, which runs a bit small."
3.0,Fits and looks like a long T-shirt honestly but for a casual event- very casual- it will do
3.0,"You definitely get what you pay for. The tongue ripped out of one of the shoes the second day my son more then. As others reviewers have stated, they run small. I ordered 1 size up but probably could have gone 2 sizes up. I was just looking for something cheap to get through the summer and that’s what these are. My son loves them so I guess they were a decent purchase."
3.0,"I just got this in the mail and I like it, but it is what I had expected for a piece of jewelry.  The Morgan Silver Dollar was obviously cleaned and polished, removing some of the defining details.  It would have been worth more (to a collector of Morgans) had it not been cleaned, and it would have looked nicer.  It would have also kept that air of historical mystique without the cleaning.<br /><br />Over all it is what I expected from a jeweler and I am happy."
3.0,Casual top
3.0,"Love the watch and bought it in February 2020, BUT it officially now won't charge, turn on, or nothing. I am really upset because I really loved it! I can't believe it didn't even last a year! I thought I would have it for YEARS! I don't know what to do. I might buy another one but how long will that one last!"
3.0,"Good for basic pieces. It looks great but runs small. I still like this brand. One of the few brands that offer consistently flattering clothing.<br /><br />But, the pants do not survive too many washes. After 15 or so washes, the pants’ stitching starts to look frayed in that back seam."
3.0,These feel more like safety glasses than ski goggles. They are really inexpensive but are really slim and don't cover the hole that remains from my hood i wear. These fit more like sun glasses than goggles which is unfortunate i may use them as snow blower glasses but this is not a replacement for your current ski googles
3.0,"The design is cute, but I though it ran very small, especially for a sweatshirt. I usually get a L or XL in a sweatshirt, but this XXL is definitely in the small side. I can wear it, but I was really wanting an oversized cozy sweatshirt to wear as a tunic over leggings."
3.0,I adore rose colored lenses.
3.0,LOOKS GOOD FROM FAR AWAY BUT FROM CLOSE UP IT'S POOR QUALITY
3.0,Quality is not very good but very pretty.
3.0,"I take care of these goggles according to instructions, but both goggles become foggy after a few lapses. I do like, however, the closure on the back."
3.0,"Well one came broken, I emailed the company and they didn’t really care. They said they’d send me another one, they never did. But anyways I bought a size 5, I’m a true 5.5 and it fit perfectly. I’m a nurse, taking on and off my gloves is never comes off. The colors have lasted."
3.0,"11/23/2018, I bought this back on January 3 of this year. The leggings fit perfectly, except they might be a tiny bit too long for the more petite. I'm 5'3, 130lbs and ordered a small. The material is very thin and, like others said, not squat proof. Wearing darker colored underwear will show through just standing normally. I run and wore light colors so it wasn't much of an issue for me (other than the underwear lines!), but it is a hassle for the low price.<br /><br />After several months, the thin material is ripping. There are tiny holes which I'll try to fix with thread to get a little more wear out of them, but these aren't leggings that can be kept for long."
3.0,"I ordered the 8.5mm chain among the options here. To be honest I found it a little disappointing, perhaps because of unrealistic expectations. The first of these was my poor understanding metric sizing; the 8.5mm dimension was much thinner I expected. It was also quite short in length. It seemed rather flimsy to me when it arrived. The color also wasn't particularly impressive either. Yet I have to note that these chains are very inexpensive; it would be pretty unrealistic, even unreasonable, to expect too much more for the money being asked for the chain I got. My bottom line is that these chains are ok for those who like thinner, lighter costume jewelry for everyday casual wear. Those who like me want bolder or better quality blink should be willing and able to pay for them."
3.0,color looks brown not grey
3.0,not long enough through the torso.
3.0,cute and danty. but it runs to big for me even after adjusting it
3.0,Has a very strong smell to it which makes me nervous about the chemical used to make it. Could be hazardous. I've read certain chemicals used to make women's bags have been found to cause cancer. So now I'm sketched with it. Might sound crazy but I'm just weary about cheap quality items.
3.0,fair. would like to have  had the accordion type . However this fit and served the purpose well enough .
3.0,These yoga pants were smaller than other Yummie Tummie pants that I have.  Not a lot but enough to be uncomfortable.
3.0,"Not exactly the material for my usage needs as beach pants walking the shorelines and wading through shallow surf.  It's very thin polyester lays like those long baggy basketball shorts.  Good style and design just doesn't work well with this material, especially the pocket design can hold regular keys down in the pocket, but those battery operated remote keys might fall out of the pocket when jogging, due to the slit design with this type of loose thin material."
3.0,"85% Polyamide 15% Elastane. 20 DenierFeaturing: Sheer/Stretchy/Basic solid colors/ Fit Perfectly/Stay Up is what the item description says. These were actually long enough for me with a 37"" inseam. That alone is rare. 3 pack black pantyhose. But around the stomach/waist it was too tight despite being right size. I would recommend getting larger size. The toe isn't reinforced either. I could see how these might get runs easily."
3.0,I bought these Nursing Bras for my daughter. At first she said they are ok but then they stretch out and straps start falling down. Also when wash the pads fold up.
3.0,It’s just so small but really cute I just wish it was bigger
3.0,Only the big one is adjustable. It feels fine on my hand. Just gotta ask my girlfriend how hers fits.
3.0,Just not as flattering as it shows in the pic. Nice soft fabric though
3.0,"Not the best, but good for smaller kites. Not enough padding to protect wrists and hands with a larger kite or parafoil"
3.0,"Runs small, I ordered a 2XL and that fitted me too tight but otherwise the hoodie has a great design I like the looks of it, just wish it didn’t run small. Also it’s pretty thin maybe best used as a windbreaker"
3.0,"I really like this bag, it's perfect for my Lenovo Yoga 900. It has a lot of handy compartments, it looks durable and well-made. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the strong rubber smell - I hope it will diminish with time."
3.0,These shorts are ok. I'm 6'2 270lbs with a 38 inch waist. They fall about 4 inch below my knees which is too long for me. The fabric doesn't really give either. Good for lounging around the house. If you're a bigger person I'd say pass on them.
3.0,It is beautiful but it feels a bit cheap not super high quality but it is okay.The strap that goes around is separate & doesn't have anything to hold it in place .Usually all top wear of that style have little attachments to hang them around the waist.
3.0,"Great looking band, but therose gold color is coming off after wearing it a week."
3.0,"Cute cover up. Has a funny smell though and I am afraid to wash it, might fall apart."
3.0,"The dress was cute it just didn’t fit me like I wanted it. I’m pretty busty so i figured the chest would be a little snug but i could have dealt with that. However, I would have preferred it to be shorter than it was."
3.0,Turns wrist green but cute
3.0,very light but it is a wonderful fit.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this tank top. It's loose fitting and has a neat design. However, it is a bit on the small side, so order a size up. The arm holes cut very close to your under arms, even if you go a size up, so I hardly wear this top. It tends to run short as well. I would not reccomend. Wish I had returned it."
3.0,"Very thin material therefore the fit isn’t what I expected, however comfortable for a lounge day."
3.0,"This item is beautiful, the clasp is flimsy."
3.0,Starts to tarnish inside your belly button after prolonged wear. Mine got infected and had to take it out.
3.0,This is a one time wear only. The necklace is very sharp. It was hurting my daughter’s neck. She had to take off the necklace.
3.0,"The photo makes it look like the pink really stands out. It doesn't. The quality is good, but the color isn't as bright as one would be led to think after seeing the photo. If you have a light complection they may not looks as good as someone with a darker one. The Necklace chain is very fragile. and the Heart is smaller than the photo lets you believe. Was the GF happy? She said she was. But i know better than that....."
3.0,"Only wore like twice, it must've come like this, though I can't say for sure. The other one it came with so far is still good.<br />Maybe find better quality."
3.0,"ring looks great, fits great.  Only issue I have is stone was cut uneven"
3.0,Pretty stiff bag. Straps feel almost like cardboard. Color is nice though and I like how it looks.
3.0,Somewhat too small but my Mom likes it any way. I only wish that it also came in a 5x because that would fit perfectly.
3.0,"very thin material, does not wear well with a large chest"
3.0,"Heads up to all, order 1 or even 2 sizes larger than what you need/want.<br />I took heed of other reviews and ordered a 2T for my daughter who is still in 18m size for hoodies and jackets, and boy am I happy I did or else it would be a return.<br />Even being 2T it fits her the exact same as her 18m size hoodie so it likely won't even last us until Spring before she outgrows it.<br />This is a super cute hoodie though, and so far seems to be excellent quality, which is the reason for 3 stars. If it was true to size it would get 5 stars from us."
3.0,These are super cute shoes but beware they jingle every step you take!
3.0,"We bought these socks for our skiing/snowboarding vacation.  While the price was good (we bought the six-pack) and the socks do stay up, they run small (men's 10 is not a Medium) and they absolutely do not keep your feet warm in winter conditions.  Not sure what the % of wool is, but it doesn't seem high.  We would not buy again."
3.0,Love the stripes and style. Hate that this shirt runs about 2 sizes too small!!!!
3.0,"Oh, they work, but some instructions and a tool to pull them through sure would've been appreciated.<br />But they DO work after going to their Amazon web page to figure out how they work. How much more would it hve cost to include a slip of paper with ANY instructions?"
3.0,THESE ARE NICE BUT NOT AS USEFUL AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE. BUT I GUESS THEY ARE GOOD TO HAVE.
3.0,I like the item it jus does give the same look as the photo but I can work with it
3.0,Nice shorts but the zipper is not smooth and feels cheap.  I hope the zipper doesn't fail like my last pair of shorts.
3.0,Love the style but to small  again
3.0,Tore in seem shortly after purchasing. Daughter enjoyed design.
3.0,There are significant sizing differences between the two. The gray is great and fits as expected. The black was too small and very stiff with no five.
3.0,The fabric quality is fine but the print and graphics isn’t as 3D as the picture. My son thinks it’s comfy.
3.0,I only wore this once on my wedding day and the bottom started falling apart by the end of the night. I only recommend getting this if it's going to be a one time use.
3.0,"5’1 and 200lbs. Bought XXL to have a little extra room to do spidey things, but the extra material was in the arm length, leg length and hands(?).<br />Also, don’t plan to wear undies because you could read my size tags through the material.<br />It would have been cute had I been taller with bigger hands and longer arms."
3.0,Length and sizing is OK. I am just not impressed with the neck area; fits like a bib draped tightly across my neck.
3.0,A tad small but perfect for my daughter
3.0,"I like the concept, but the fabric is too thin. It is too obvious if you have your phone in the pocket. I would only recommend this if you only want to carry some money and a passport. I still like it, but it could bebetter"
3.0,The material is not what I was expecting. It is not a soft material. The zipper on the outfit does work properly. I
3.0,I like the stretchiness of these shorts but they run real small.
3.0,Pockets are ridiculously huge and are like the untethered ears of a bloodhound preventing you from using them. Lame.
3.0,"These would be so awesome if my ears were pierced properly when I was younger. They are so high that when I try to get cuffs around my lobes they're too tight and not attractive. I think these would look bad-bottomed on a much nicer, less fat ear."
3.0,"Very lightweight material.  Pockets and ""shorts"" (added for sheerness I guess) make the legs lay kind of funky.  Cute, but not really what I was expecting.  I ordered an XL and my daughter who is a size medium will wear it."
3.0,i think these were one size fits all no one size fits very small  the trim on the bottom is not very strong and the pattern is kinda lame
3.0,&#34;non skid&#34; is bumpy beads. thought they would be more rubberized and flat. will see how they hold up.
3.0,"Doesn't look much like the picture - the color is very washed out. Extremely pale, almost appears black and grey. Edges are very delicate - black is already scuffed off around the corners though treated very well."
3.0,So basically I bought pull down shades for my outdoor patio. (6ft by 6ft). There is a 4 inch gap on each side of the shade as my patio is a little bigger.. I need to tie the sides to the walls and these are not for that. There ties are only 3inch  lol soo if you’re in my position don’t waste your money
3.0,"Cute earings and you can't expect much for the price but they are a bit loose and I worried they would fall out. I managed to wear them one whole day without them getting lost. But it's a risk lol. I'm sure you could find a way to make them stay tighter on your ear. I do love them though. A bit heavy, but you do have a little kitty hanging from your ear :P"
3.0,"Item is cute, but bracelet is super small and not adjustable.  This would be a great product if you could adjust the bracelet to accommodate a variety of wrist sizes."
3.0,Weird fit & weird fabric.  Ended up returning.
3.0,its hard to place in your hair without tangling the chains up! alright quality for the price though so can't really complain!
3.0,Its cute and it arrived on time. The material is actually thick enough not to see through.... HOWEVER  one of the seems unraveled the first time i wore it..... smh
3.0,Baja calidad de los materiales
3.0,shoes are loose around the soles almost like they will split open soon.  She has only worn them for a week so far.
3.0,Fits good .. nice material
3.0,"Adorable, fun bracelet. Like the style and structure but a little disappointed that this is not a sterling silver metal as it will probably tarnish down the road."
3.0,I got this to replace my lanyard the broke. I was sad that after a month it started to turn. I never got it wet and always stored it away from elements.
3.0,Overall it’s ok. The beads is very pretty but the seams on the sleeves look very cheap because the seams are outside of the sleeves. Wish it had a better material to hide the seams
3.0,I had such high hopes for this outfit. I ordered the first time in my size 2x and the shorts fit but shirt was too tight. I figured a 4x would definitely fit do I returned 2x and ordered again. Same thing happened shirt just too tight. Shorts fit a little bigger but the shirt didn't seem to change at all. Cute outfit but fit I'd not true.
3.0,The Size is yo big for me
3.0,"Bought this dress on a lightening deal because it seemed to good to pass up. Even with the dress being only $8 and a cute print, I ended up returning it. I am petite 5'3"" and 125lbs and I was drowning in the dress. It was so large and unflattering. Possibly could work on someone taller, but it wasn't worth it for me."
3.0,"Broke a week after my daughter wore it, not good quality"
3.0,My wife yelled at me for spending so much money for a pair of socks.
3.0,Didnot fit well.
3.0,I ordered an XL and it is VERY small - could not wear.
3.0,"I typically wear a size Large.. when I saw the material I ordered a size larger for the ""no give"" in fabric.. it was way too small to wear.. but I love the way it feels and looks in real life"
3.0,This belt is awesome. Ive had the belt for 2 weeks now and I love the ratcheting feature!!! My belt and pants fit perfectly every time!! It takes some gettting used to but once you get it down the belt is fantastic. I bought the all black version of this belt to match my uniform for work. The paint on the front of the buckle is starting to come off and I haven’t done any hard work or done anything crazy with the belt. That’s the reason I’m giving this belt 3 stars. It doesn’t affect the functionality of ratcheting of the belt at all but I like for my uniform to look nice and neat. Hence the reason for my 3 star rating. If they have something that doesn’t scratch I would suggest getting that. I would certainly buy this belt again though. Just not the black buckled one......
3.0,"It's really beautiful, but the time piece itself is really large.  I have small wrists, so it's kind of awkward.  I'm keeping it, because I will wear it some times."
3.0,"The glasspiece came off before even wearing. Can be glued back on, but the combined materials also do not looks as I imaged based on the pictures, hence 3stars"
3.0,I bought this exact same pair at a crocs store size 8. The size 9 I bought from this retailer are smaller then his size 8s. They are much more narrow and tight on the top of the foot. Im currently trying to stretch them out for him but if they don't then Im out of $35. Im wondering if they were cut smaller.
3.0,Pretty dress. Purchased an xxl because I wear an xl in clothes size 14/16. The dress was too small. The XXL fit like a size 12. I’m 5 ‘3 185 lbs. The skirt part of the dress is pleated. Not too heavy material. Very modest. Too bad size didn’t work for me.
3.0,"I'm 70"" tall & 44"" waist. Ordered XXL.<br />Overall this jumpsuit fits good is comfortable, lite & dries quickly!<br />All buttons, waist string for tightening the midsection, one breast & two lower front pockets, only.<br />When bending over or sitting you'll start noticing the stitching in the rear end area begins to stress, I've learned to lift up on my pants legs to give more room in this area for those times.<br />But, there's no button fly! Making it very inconvenient, when you have to urinate!<br />Basically, have to take it down to your knees or bend over, like the hunchback of Notre Dame, finagle your junk up to the first three lower buttons to do your business!"
3.0,It is too small to allow for any overlap at all. Curiously the sleeves are extremely long. I am average height and the sleeves hung about two or three inches below my wrists. Returned it.
3.0,Ok for the price. A little flimsy and the chain is not very strong. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"like the pockets but the fit is on small side,fabric washes well,no wrinkles,covers up well,thick enough fabric."
3.0,Pretty thin. Not impressed.
3.0,"I bought this dress as an option to wear in Vegas.  After a JLo concert wearing another dress, I put this one on.  I am usually a size 10 and got the 10/12.  It fit perfect.  It was super comfy and blousy in the right areas.  Unfortunately, where the jewels are attached at the sleeve, we realized it's very cheaply made because it BROKE!  Luckily, I was in a friend's dress store and he sewed it for me on the spot.  I'm not sure it's worth even $25 but it worked enough to make it the rest of the evening.  If you do buy this, be careful with it, or maybe even check the stitching (or reinforce it yourself)."
3.0,So for reference I am 5'7&#34; 148lbs and 34 C.  I ordered a medium and the bottom was wayyyy too snug I think if I sat down it would have ripped.  The top was also a bit loose which was disappointing.
3.0,"Nice jersey, but runs really small. Can't wear it yet."
3.0,"I love the fabric. The bill on the cap is much larger than I expected, maybe it would  be better for a man.  I didn't return it because of the fabric and I wear it sometimes"
3.0,"I love the print and I purchased a size bigger than I normally would have because of all of the reviews saying it fits small. The bottoms fit perfectly, but the top has zero support. I won't be able to do anything aside from lounge in this suit because if I move around my breast spill out of the bottom of the suit. Those who are slightly bustier should probably look at a different suit.."
3.0,"The earrings are pretty, but much larger than I expected, to big for a child, to big to look like real opals.  The opal is a flat disk sitting in the setting. Not my favorite pair of earrings. They were discribed as small, these look like a 2k size stone , to big for my second top hole, which is what I had planned on using them for."
3.0,Looks like the model picture but made with thin material. It was also a little bigger than I expected.
3.0,"I got a 2X Bc I like my hoodies oversized. I normally wear an XL, this fit like a medium. It wasn’t a hoodie it was more of a long sleeve shirt with a hood. Even tho I really still liked it but had to return it Bc it didn’t fit. So sad but I really did like it 😔"
3.0,I wasn’t too impressed with this shirt.  The fit is snug.  The design and colors are good but it is not the same quality as all of the other shirts and blouses I’ve purchased from Amazon and their sellers.
3.0,Much larger than expected. It looked more like a maternity dress.
3.0,this band is okay but it says small/medium and it is MUCH longer than my other small/medium bands. will be returning as i dont like how the excess band looks and gets in the way
3.0,I goofed. It didn’t register for me that the belt more sash than belt. It is very wide.
3.0,A satisfactory  product. I wanted a sock that was predominately wool and covered my lower leg to provide protection from boot top abrasion and external forces. Met my basic needs. Will hopefully be durable and long lasting but only time will tell.
3.0,A size small.. 3t fits like 2t. Literally the same shirt size when placed on top of the other.
3.0,It's definitely cut very small. I got an extra large and it fit but it was not oversized at all. It's definitely a form fitting hoodie and definitely just locked screen printed was not what I expected.
3.0,Don’t fit me but my my toddler loves them.
3.0,they work very nice and look good but the plastic frame is not high quality and they break fairly easily and don't last very long even if you are careful with them.
3.0,Cute but stitching came unraveled through out night gown top trim.
3.0,"These headbands were very pretty and they look like they're well-made, but I don't see how anyone could work out in them.  They slip off very easily.  I wore them during a cross-fit style workout and just around the house, and in both situations, I kept having to stop and put the headband on again because it wouldn't stay on my head.  Maybe it would stay on better if I kept it at its widest, but that basically takes up my entire head, and even then I think it would slip off.  If you're wearing this just for fashion, it's probably fine, since they are nice-looking, but you should be ready to adjust it often."
3.0,"They are made of great material, however, they did not fit the glasses (Costas) that I had purchased them for. Bummer!"
3.0,They didn’t fit right
3.0,Ordered a Large and it looks like it could maybe fit a size 0 or smaller.
3.0,I bought two of these to wear with the pajama shorts. I ordered XL and the sleeves are tight and the body is huge. So I’m giving them away. I don’t know why manufacturers make such tight sleeves for a large size. Most people who wear a large or xl do not have skinny girl arms! 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,"For the price I think it was cheap looking, I returned it."
3.0,"This didn’t fit me well so I had to return it. (Returns are not free which was disappointing. ) Also, the material was a lot thinner than I anticipated and kind of scratchy. If it had fit well it would have been really cute though."
3.0,"Got this because I really wanted a large brim.  But As other reviewers have stated  visor is very tight. However, spouse was able to stretch out band around visor almost flat for a few seconds and this seemed to loosen it up enough that I can wear it without a headache."
3.0,"Love the sweater, however I ordered 5 different colors, and not one matches the color shown,<br />beware of this."
3.0,Super cute! I love the way they look. The piece between the eyes that goes on your nose gives me a headache. I’m sure that’s not the case for everyone.
3.0,"They are super cute and very well made. However, they are very, very big! Way to big for my face. I look like a fly. So sad I can't wear them. :("
3.0,I loved the way this was made but because I am busty there was no way it was going over the girls. Order the next size up if you have any doubts.
3.0,"I ordered a size up because I thought it went with asian sizing, but now I'm stuck with a shirt thats too big for me"
3.0,"Love the silky smooth material and it looks great like the photo, but it rides right up, quickly too. Maybe order a size up to stop this from happening?"
3.0,"Very cute dress, but the bust area is very odd, no room for a ""busty"" girl,"
3.0,Very cute and small like I wanted but I don’t feel like it will last long.  Stitching is weak.
3.0,"Listen, I would liken this to a pair of gorgeous but UNCOMFORTABLE high heals:<br /><br />It will make you look good, it will be adorable, you will get a lot of compliments.<br />But it will hurt like all heck!<br /><br />This could entirely depend on two things:<br /><br />1) How big your nose is<br />2) Where (how high/low) your septum was pierced<br /><br />For me, the piercing fits SMALL. There's no room to wiggle it, and even just accidentally brushing against it (like if I wipe at my nose) really STINGS because it pulls at the skin weird.<br /><br />I can't sleep with it in because I wake up from it.<br /><br />I'd say this is ideal for going out - you wanna spruce up your face for a festival? Or for a club? Or for looking hot on a date?<br />Buy it.<br /><br />But if you have a bigger nose or your septum was pierced pretty high up, there's literally no wiggle room for this so your nose will probably not like it, and you won't want to wear it everyday."
3.0,"XL fits US size 16 with room. Cuff sits just above ankle on 5'4"", soft & well made, but obviously someone wore these before they were sent to me. I blame the seller."
3.0,Shirt is very light weight.  It also runs a little small.
3.0,"These leggings were ""just ok.""  The material is not as ""stretchy"" as most workout pants and leggings are which do not make them my most comfortable pair.  They're a bit stiff for workout pants even after washing and wearing them several times.  I do like the pockets on the sides and my cell phone fits in it.  They're ok.  I likely will be looking to buy a different brand that isn't as stiff."
3.0,It looks good. The color has not changed but my hair keep getting stuck on it  and gets ripped out :(
3.0,Need to buy bigger size
3.0,The material is itchy.
3.0,Bracelets were rusted when they arrived.
3.0,Beautiful but the sleeves are extremely tight
3.0,"Super cute. I like the 2 types of straps and I like that there is a zipper. Soft and a nice color.<br /><br />The problems are as follows:<br />The bag was used because when I went to use it there was a used chapstick and a coffee stir straw in the bag. Another issue is the fact that the tassel strap is badly cute (not even). The last issue is that the longer strap is hard to use because the other strap/handle keeps coming out. Overall, you get what you pay for."
3.0,Although I like Michael Kors this one is a bit flashy to me at this particular time<br />it does resemble a man's watch because it has  a big face (i like that easier to read)<br />but all the crystals make it bling<br /><br />if i had to do it all over again at this time i would not  buy it<br />For me its too much right now but i change btwn minimal to flashy with where i go or who<br />I m with so it will get worn<br />its got a ton of crystals but the cut of the crystals arent like a diamond ring bling.so you wont be at risk of blinding anyone in the eye if your watch catches the sun<br />when I do go somewhere that's dressy<br /> I'll enjoy wearing it<br /> I took it to a Jewelers and they took out3 llnks<br />im not bigboned but im not small boned either<br />5''6  121-126pounds proportioned evenly
3.0,"I was so confused on how to use this. It came with limited instructions and, in my opinion, very hard to use."
3.0,Nice short but it shrunk after first wash. I washed it in cold as well.
3.0,Cute pjs but the pants ran small not true to size
3.0,They kept rolling off of my feet. Looked really pretty on though
3.0,"In general I wear a 7.5 sandal and, perhaps because of a wide foot and high instep, an 8 (occasionally 8.5) in closed-toe shoes (boots, pumps, sneakers, etc). I got these in an 8 and they fit as expected. My heels slip out when I walk, but I have that problem a lot. The sole has a good deal of padding and they feel pretty sturdy. I'm not crazy about how they look. They're kind of clunky and make my feet look big. If you're looking for a  sexy shoe, this is totally not it, I would go as far as to say they are dowdy-looking."
3.0,The picture made this look like more of a sweater or thicker material. It was a bit too thin/t-shirt material for what I was looking for.
3.0,Like the stile<br />To large
3.0,Thought it’s be a cute oversized jacket but it just looked dull
3.0,"This is a really cute set but the sizing is not what I'm used to. I believe that I ordered a 3X or 4X but when you look inside of the piece they say a size 20... that is not a 3X. I can get it on but I'm very boobylicious with the bra on, lol. It is a cute set though."
3.0,Too short for boots
3.0,Has slick sole and size runs large
3.0,"I wear a size 11.5 wide mens for boots and shoes. I need a new pair of slide in sandals as the ones I purchased years ago are about done for. I knew that these would be a bit on the small side, but these are at least 1-2 sizes too small for my feet. My back of my heel hangs off the back and the sandals are very tight in the toe box, no way they are actually wide."
3.0,"The dress is fine, but not as cute as the pic. The ruffles at the waist are sort of in a weird place."
3.0,"Yes, I ordered a size 9, but when I say big, that's not what I mean. It fits true to size and if you are unsure what size you want, I highly suggest the ring size guide from LDS Bookstore. I found the printable pdf online while searching and it can help you find your size three different ways. I've struggled with that in the past and this is the best size guide I've ever found. Anyway, back to the ring itself... It comes in a beautiful and well made box - something you could easily present to someone and not feel like a cheapskate. It also comes with a small microfiber cleaning cloth in case you don't already have about a million of those floating around your home. Then there's the ring. Looking down on the ring, it is quite beautiful. The center stone is pretty large, about a centimeter across, and is surrounded by smaller stones. The band is also surrounded in small stones except for the very bottom of the ring where it is a solid band. Because the stones are inset in the band, it is fairly thick. It's not so think that your fingers can't close around it, but it may take a little getting used to. My biggest concern is that, due to the size of the main part of the ring, it sits pretty high up off the finger. I mentioned the round middle stone is about a centimeter across and the whole thing sits about that high up from the top of the band. I would say it is definitely a show piece and may cause some problems if you work with your hands much at all. It's a bit too big for my wife so it may not get worn much so I took one star away for that. I took off the other star because, although the ring feels well built, the center focal part is a little twisted. It's not too drastic, but if you're looking at it from above, the band isn't really perpendicular (I think that may be the first time I've used that word since my geometry classes) to the middle. It is just off enough where it's a little hard to notice, but once you know it's there, you can't unsee it. Even so, the price of the ring seems very reasonable. It's not a ring for everyone, but if it matches your style, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3.0,The waistband is too loose. I bought 2 pairs of XL from Ecko and they both have the same issue.
3.0,Looks okay but feels thin and cheap. The buckle looks fragile. Not bad for the price I suppose.
3.0,Looks better in pictures than it really is. The pocket of the filter doesn’t align with the nose but it does for the mouth.
3.0,Fabric not friendly.<br />Hand washed cold water flat dried and it still shrunk.... shoot!
3.0,"I loved this buzzer at first, it is quiet and waterproof and comes with clipper guides of various lengths .  Now that my toddler can talk, he tells me it pulls his hair a lot and he hates getting his hair buzzed.  I always wondered why he cried when I used it when he was a baby, I figured he was just sensitive to the noise.  These clippers are just not sharp enough, and my kid has fine thin hair.  Can't imagine how much it would yank on coarse or thick hair."
3.0,The dress for me like a empire dress.  Pic is deceiving. If you have a long torso rhe top portion reaches just below the chest area manning the bottom look odd.  Had to return it
3.0,Shorts are perfect. Top isn’t adjustable enough to bring the shirt up in the front. I had to put a hair tie there tonight until I can see it to keep it from exposing my boobs.
3.0,"really cool idea, loved it from the moment I saw it. but very hard to keep in place at all, plus it doesn't feel so good when it slides off the ear and hangs by the single earring hole. loved it but ended up giving it to may daughter as it fit her better anyways."
3.0,"Bought this strap for a new Martin DRS2 acoustic-electric. The strap seems well made, the fabric is soft and the length seems OK (I'm 6 ft). The leather ends seem so-so, not overly cheap but not expensive either. The main problem I have is the fact that the strap holes don't fit the strap button on the bottom of the Martin. This strap button is also the jack to plug a cord into the guitar and as such it's designed differently than the button on the neck of the guitar. The leather has a hard time going over the button and simply doesn't hold well. This is not necessarily the fault of the strap but it's not a good choice if you have a guitar that uses a similar strap button."
3.0,Not the greatest ankle bracelets. Some fell apart right away and some held up for a month or so. But you can’t complain about the price and the large assortment.
3.0,Nice but do small.  ;~{
3.0,"Bought these for my girlfriend and she liked them at first, but said they &#34;both earrings kinda fell apart&#34;"
3.0,Heavy enough for warmth....but not soft
3.0,"Cute and casual, really soft but material is not made for hot summer days 🥵"
3.0,"It's a little small, but fits well enough.  Just beware that the area on the model right below her hands is a TON of fabric.  It really sticks out like very baggy pockets.  Can't decide if it's too odd, or Okay.  Might have to give to my daughter"
3.0,invest in a better set this one is flimsy. The balls fall off very easily.
3.0,"Besides my skin turned silver, this is a very nice space suit!"
3.0,Cheap product and they fall out
3.0,"These are cute and they look really pretty, but they're bigger than I thought.  They're a good 2-3 inches tall.  I guess I thought they would be daintier.  Maybe the description said so and I didn't pay attention.  My daughter got them for Christmas, and she said she likes them, but I'm not sure if she'll wear them because of the size. We'll see."
3.0,"These are good earnings, but I had a hard time deciding what color was what. The light ones are very light, so at first I thought I had four pairs of clear ones."
3.0,"Thought they would appear more discreet when worn,  Looked too boxy."
3.0,"Gloves didn’t hold up like I was hoping they would. They literally were tearing as I pulled them out of the box. I gave them 3 stars, because it was fast shipping and the gloves that I was able to get out did decently. You definitely have to be careful putting these on otherwise they rip rather easily as you pull them"
3.0,"One of them broke pretty quickly. I was able to put it back together, but still a little cheap."
3.0,"Good glasses but I have a normal sized head and they just seemed to small, a little tight on my head."
3.0,like eyebobs.  they were to large for my face. had to take to adjust.
3.0,"weird material, shoulders are oddly constructed. looks fine as long as no one touches it"
3.0,All Items run small and I need to order the next size larger in hopes that it fits across the shoulders as well as the chest area. Not everyone is flat chested.
3.0,I cannot figure out the grinder as there are no markers on them. You have to keep twisting to see what they will do as far as thickness
3.0,"This is a weird fit for me - almost snug in the waist, but loose around the arms.  I love the design, though, and the fabric doesn't feel cheap."
3.0,"The shirt is gorgeous so I don't want to come across as too negative here.  I did consider all the feedback left by previous purchasers and ordered a larger size, too, but it was still way too small.  One review indicated they usually wear a 10-12 and ordered a 2x and the fit was pretty good.  I usually wear a 14 (or an XL) - so I ordered a 4x and it fits more like a medium would.  I'm so sad that I can't wear this (unless I lose about 20/25 pounds) because it's such a pretty shirt.  It's a beautiful salmon color and the beading on the neckline is nicely done....not a bunch of loose beads, but attached very nicely.  So - major caution if you want to buy this - if you're larger than a 12, I doubt the largest size (a 4X) is going to fit you.  It runs very narrow and the lining is on the short side too.  If you're petite it will probably be perfect for you."
3.0,I have ordered a few pair of glasses from this company.  These are not my favorite.  They feel very plastic and fragile.
3.0,Nice but broke soon after wearing
3.0,"The earrings I received did not match the photo. Same overall size, but thicker, clunky looking. Post is not stainless steel or sterling, but is gold plated base metal. Essentially, rather gaudy looking.<br /><br />BUT, I needed a cheap pair of huggie earrings to wear at the stables, and to shower in, and to sleep in, and these will work. Maybe I should start a collection of vulgar gaudy cheap earrings to wear with the horses.<br /><br />Also, the shipping time on these, even with the COVID-19 delays, was excessive, like three weeks. If they are in stock, and at the warehouse, then they are only a couple days away, plus a week for the virus.<br /><br />So, buyer beware. You might like these, but you'll not get what is in the photo. :)"
3.0,"Works, looks ok if you don't look too closely. Seems decently made."
3.0,"Description and bullets are conflicting: ""Down vest"" .. ""polyester blend"" .. ""snap front"" .. ""reverse zipper"" ?<br />This is a polyester fill vest, snap button front (no zipper), however, very good quality for the price.<br />I wanted down (you know, the ""fluffy fine feathers""), but considering the price, I'm happy with the vest.<br />Remember, it's made in China, so if you are in the US, buy a size or two larger. I'm a medium, and ordered XL. It fits me fine. I'd say order one size up for a snug fit, two sizes up for a looser fit."
3.0,Fine for the costume
3.0,I had to alter it a little in the armpit but otherwise super cute.
3.0,Hard to get hooked up
3.0,Its beautiful but very hard to put on and it rolls
3.0,All Caps are not of same quality
3.0,"Would feel comfy and soft, only it doesn't fit me I couldn't get it on properly.  Runs small. I normally wear 2XL  in bottoms and this is suppose to be stretchy so thought it would fit but no."
3.0,"it looks great, but returning because it is way to big."
3.0,"Product quality is good, size is somewhat really snug. I can't use this for a long time, not too comfortable."
3.0,made well too small and im normally a medium or small
3.0,This is a warm vest just wish it was true to size. It runs small. It fits but is tight if you zip it up. Wasn't worth paying return shipping to exchange for a bigger size.
3.0,I wish this fit better. Way too big all around.
3.0,These are incredibly unnatractive but very comfortable.
3.0,EXTREMELY SMALL
3.0,"This would be a great bomber if it wasn't so dang small. I even went up a size just in case, but it's super tight across the shoulders and the sleeves are short. The large is basically a small. Pretty bummed because I like the look of the coat a lot."
3.0,Sent back because it didn't fit well and i found a different dress. Otherwise it was nice looking
3.0,"This duster is lightweight as described.  The texture of the fabric makes it feminine and the gold color is pretty with denim jeans.  Probably on the right person with the perfect shirt under it, the vest would look  nice, but I was not super excited with how much it looks like ""fast fad fashion"".  I do not think this is an item that will stay in the closet long or be worn very often, but maybe you will see more possibilities than I do."
3.0,I'm a xl and they fit like a LG. Comfortable.
3.0,Very thin fabric. Can't be worn as pants without a long shirt over the bum.
3.0,Nice but waaayyyy smaller than the sizing chart
3.0,"I bought this dress because the neckline allows for easy nursing; however, I must warn you that not only is the dress longer in the front than it is in the back but is also transparent.  This can be fixed with scissors and nude undies if one is willing to go that far, though I am not sure it is worth it to do so.  I would not recommend this dress unless one is looking for a cheap alternative nursing dress and is willing to make alterations."
3.0,Very cute dress and I love how bright it is! It fits really well but the pockets don't sit right and they kind of poke out on the sides. It's not a big deal because it is a super cheap dress. Overall I love it though.
3.0,"Comfortable.  But they shrink after each washing.....  I bought two packages cause I like the way they feel, but now they are too tight.  Bummed."
3.0,"Wish it was a wider wallet.  The pockets need to be wider, not all cards fit.  Could have a change pocket and another id window and be wider and perhaps a tropical print like Liz Claiborne."
3.0,"One of the pairs of shorts developed a hole after the first wear, but otherwise they're good."
3.0,This was larger than expected but has several uses including for a winter snowman
3.0,It is a Christmas present so don't really know how it performs but the quality is good so far.
3.0,does not glow blue
3.0,My friend really like
3.0,"They are very nice, I did wear them for eight hours but the feel a little big my feet slide to the front of the shoe"
3.0,The white looks dingy. Was looking for a white white. I'll use it for a swimsuit cover up.
3.0,"Super cute, but not at all durable. Both heels are splitting after less than two days worn. :-( Won't last much longer."
3.0,"I like the bag, but the Velcro on the front pockets started to rip off after two weeks of use."
3.0,"It comes flattened fyi,  I was unaware of that sooo now i gotta get a pump and a needle for it apparently"
3.0,"The jumpsuit was fine being large. If it had been cold, other clothes could be worn beneath.  The ""helmet"" didn't fully cover the child's head and was flimsy (as were the kneepads).  But the child was comfortable and looked how he wanted to look, so all was good."
3.0,I don’t like the cotton frantic. It is hard to fit into it
3.0,"Fits a Galaxy Note OK, but concerned that it may not last too long as the vinyl seemed a little on the thin side."
3.0,This is light weight but looks nice. I have serval shawls but this one will not stay on my shoulders when I move around. The material is not heavy enough.
3.0,cheaply made. It was a little big and I actually ripped a pocket in it.  Got it to wear at a wedding.
3.0,No way M is 29 inches. It's rather small. Wanted to wear it on vacation too bad had to return.
3.0,"While it does look pretty good with the Timex weekender, the main problem was how unwieldy it is. The big metal rings that hold the band down look like steel bulges and give the band a very odd shape. The synthetic leather doesn't feel anything like real leather, and looks worn faster (although it doesn't seem to have actually worn)."
3.0,The fabric is more thinner than a regular sweatshirt is more a french terry kind of fabric
3.0,"Great Shoe Design. Runs Short In Sizing, Sadly Had To Return Them. I Truly Love Them. Next Size Up Won't Work For Me."
3.0,"I thought the fabric was very light weight, not sure is it will last, but otherwise it was as described."
3.0,"These shorts are ok. I’ll definitely be wearing them out and about. Pros … they look good. The pockets are deep (which I like). Cons … they are thin (see pic … this is one layer through the back … not through both front and back). I don’t typically go commando but doing so in these could cause an embarrassing incident. I expect this level of sheerness from linen but these are 70% cotton so I didn’t quite expect them to be this sheer and to be fair this pic is directly backlit. Probably not what you would typically experience walking around. One final thing (neither pro nor con) … I’m boarder a line 34/36 … in these the 36 fits perfectly so size up if it’s close. Overall, I’m fairly happy with these and do plan to wear them."
3.0,"I like the style, however I don’t like how it fits"
3.0,"too small across the shoulders, but love the coat, just doesn't fit"
3.0,Thin material. It's just ok. You get what you pay for.
3.0,So cute but doesn't fit nicely.
3.0,Latch for box is off to the side not straight as it should be.
3.0,Product was what was advertised
3.0,"Like so many others, this mask is cut on the small side.  It is very nice looking but barely covers my chin & nose at the same time."
3.0,"I like that these are affordable and stylish. The challenge I have is the large gap on the side.  Please see picture with arrow drawn. While driving, if the sun is to either side you have very little coverage. I have a wide head, so I liked the fact that these fit and were comfortable. They just did not seem to provide the protection I was looking for."
3.0,I got this as a test sample . I gave this to my wife to wear and she said she somehow felt too warm after wearing and refused to wear it . There is no doubt there are some energies swirling around this bracelet
3.0,"this item is exactly a pictured. However, it is quite heavy and therefore doesn't really work well for light weight items that you don't want dragged down. On the other hand, it is strong enough to work through a something like a heavy sweater or a blazer"
3.0,"So we ordered a ""Large"" size for a 140Lbs person per the size chart......  Turns out they think a US size 3 is a Large because that is the size that came in the bag stamped ""large""...  I can't recommand these with any certainty since their sizing is so far off from reality...  The quality seems ok and is about the same as every other butt lift uoga pant out there but I can't bring myself to rate them higher since they either have no reality of human sizes or their quality control is so bad they are just randomly putting things in bags...<br /><br />I'd say skip the risk and look elsewhere....<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK"
3.0,"They're kinda see through, definitely NOT squat proof."
3.0,I do like this watch but the reason why I bought it was to see in the night. Disappointed to see that even though the numbers light when you press the button but very disappointed that you cannot see the hands at all. What's the point in seeing the numbers if you cant see where the hands are pointing!
3.0,"I wear a size 14/16 and I am 5'. I ordered the &#34;17&#34; and I cant button it around my chest, which isn't super large!! I was expecting it to be longer also, it barely covers my butt. It is very thick and nice material though!"
3.0,"Image with 4 mask and an option to pick from and not receiving 4 mask is diseptive, yeah a my bad for not reading the small title description but still, as a buyer buying things on the go I shouldn't have to worry about that and trust the seller.<br /><br />Mask feels alright. A little small. Made in China so regular size means small."
3.0,"love the material is soft and comfy however, the skirt was lil big but it i will manage."
3.0,I was excited about these goggles because they seemed large enough to provide great visibility. The visibility above water was great but the water protruding through the seal underwater allowed for about a centimeter of visibility.
3.0,The sweatshirt is just how it appears but I wish it was softer material and even though the picture looked like the sleeves are longer they were shorter on me.  Beware it’s made on China which I also wasn’t happy about.
3.0,it's ok for the price I guess but it looks cheap
3.0,"The dress is a lovely lightweight fabric, but the color was not as pictured -  I would say it was more dull.  Also, the waist hit very high and awkwardly for me and it was tight in the chest.  For someone with the right body type I think it would be good, just not for me."
3.0,Didn’t hold up very well. Started to peel after a few wears
3.0,"These look as they do in the picture, just a bit... “cheaper”."
3.0,looks nice for the price. the back light can change color if you hold the light button down.
3.0,Demasiado fina
3.0,The dress didn’t come with the belt as pictured.
3.0,"These are very thin lounge pants. They're really not going to be good for anything else. A cotton/linen blend means that they'll always be wrinkled unless you iron them.<br /><br />As lounge pants, they'll be decent. There's 2 front slash pockets and one back pocket so shallow you won't want to put your wallet in it for fear it'll fall out when you sit or stand. they're made of a textured material that features vertical stripes.<br /><br />Not bad, but only useful inside the house."
3.0,"Very thin, not that stretchy, cheap but not great"
3.0,"it took a while to receive it, its way to big; Like a half-inch bigger on every side compared to other &#34;normal&#34; wallets, decent quality material. i would not recommend this unless you have huge back pockets or like to hold your wallet constantly."
3.0,"Does not appear to be real leather.  Boots ""bunch "" around ankles giving a sloppy appearance"
3.0,Its gonna break easily. You get what you paid for.
3.0,Super cute but material is kind of thin so holes form around the toes. The grips come off after too much use.
3.0,"They’re a lot larger than anticipated, especially for a nose piercing<br />Not really worth it"
3.0,"Cute dress, hoping it would fit but I’m 5’2 about 110 pounds and this dress was too big & baggy :-( I got it in pink and it was very pink. Not the pink that looks more like a mauve/pink shown. Looks to be well made & wished it was going to work out."
3.0,"Very heavy empty, style nice. Leather ok"
3.0,It's still difficult but a lot easier.
3.0,"I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MANY OF THESE skirt for ONLY $7.99, The material is awesome and feels good on my skin. The skirt is the perfect length, but runs a little small, I don't care because I WILL MAKE IT WEARABLE, it is just TOO CUTE to send back, and I only paid $7.99 lol! I purchased a red, and a black one. UPDATE, There is nothing elastic about this skirt, BUT for this price You CANNOT beat this BEAUTIFUL SKIRT FOR $7.99, I PURCHASED TWO BLACKS, TWO RED, AND ONE BLUE! These are so nice that I had to make sure that if one somehow gets ruined I will have a back up lol, If the blue comes back in stock in my size I want another one of that color also, so that I can have a back up!! I LOVE IT AT THIS PRICE, BUT NOT MORE AS I SEE THE PRICE IS GREATLY INCREASING."
3.0,Wonder why you wont be able to retire. It's because we spend a fortune on replacement parts that are made of plastic. I bet these cost a grand total of $0.99 to make.
3.0,Elastic waistband was too wide. Just didn't look right
3.0,"I am a 32B/34A and by the size chart for these bras, it said I should buy a small, and I did. The band fit fine but the cups were way too big. I returned them."
3.0,"I love the color of this jacket. It was exactly what I was searching for, and the price was good, but the fit was off. I was able to take the jacket in to fit and wore it comfortably after that."
3.0,Button was missing
3.0,Fits tighter than I expected and the inserts drove me crazy.  Somewhat better when I removed the inserts.  Not as comfortable as they looked.
3.0,"I like the fabric, but the fit is strange. It runs large. I ordered a small based on the size chart, but wish there was an XS option."
3.0,This fit is great! Unfortunately it's much thinner than expected and the stitches are pokey/itchy. I got what I paid for I guess.
3.0,"you get pretty much what you see, I thought i was a bit more glossy, but it's like a button."
3.0,Visually compelling super light weight. But the sizing just isn't right. I got an Asian large which they claim is US medium. Even I could go up two sizes I'm not confident that it would fit.
3.0,Me queda muy apretado...lástima
3.0,"The print and styling for this bikini is awesome but it runs small and the top has an odd fit. The bottoms were much smaller than the top and usually I have the opposite problem with suits because I have a larger top than bottom. None of the straps are adjustable so that doesn't help with fit. I ordered a small and I am 5'1 120 and a 34C and the top was somewhat small and the bottoms were tiny, but fit how I would want them to if I wanted a cheeky style. I would recommend for someone with a smaller build and who wants a more revealing look. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
3.0,Light weight but made a mark on my forehead. Not as comfortable as I would have liked
3.0,Sock has a hole on toe weeks after ordering.
3.0,"I’m 5’6, 180 lbs. Large fit well. Washed once before wearing (on delicate setting), seems like it will get worn down quickly."
3.0,I just can't seem to find a pair that are comfortable for my very flat feet.
3.0,"As a taller individual, getting a shirt that fits nicely around my chest and abs while maintaining an appropriate length is very hard to do. So often I buy size large shirts and find they don't fit. that is completely the case with this shirt, even more than normal.  This shirt was to small in the chest, I barely could get it on. I'm 6'6'' 230."
3.0,One size does not fit all.these gloves are way too big but cut or fold them and it can work
3.0,cheap polar sunglasses hinged
3.0,"Made well, but too long for me.  Wish they could be adjusted to a shorter length."
3.0,"This is really detailed and a great looking piece.  However, the necklace is just as shown an OPEN cord, there is no clasp and you have to tie this to keep it on.  The issue is then it become this ultra short choker that once you tie a knot in basically needs to be cut off.  Since it’s a silky fiber cord if you don’t tie it tightly then the tie comes off quickly and you lose the necklace.<br /><br />Its really a shame because its unusual and cute I will find a way to repurposes it since it does look cool.<br /><br />The earrings are at least the hook backs and are pretty comfortable to wear.  I had no irritations or break outs on my ear when using."
3.0,"I did homework on the sizing and they were *still* way too small. Size up 2 sizes. Shoe seemed good quality, though."
3.0,I didn't like how short the shirt is. I usually have trouble when buying clothes made in Asia with the shirts being too short so I thought I'd pass that along to anyone else that is tall. Everything else about it I love though. I might only wear it with high waisted bottoms or try to sew something at the bottom to make it longer
3.0,"I love the look and feel of them, however they run really small. I normally wear a size 10 and these fit like a size 9. You can see my big toe sticking out at the end! So bummed that I had to return them because they are otherwise really comfy!!!"
3.0,So cute. It fit good but was a little shorter than expected. If you have a bigger behind you may need to order a size bigger.
3.0,It is pretty and holds a lot but the strap only lasted a few months.
3.0,Cute design but it was faded:(
3.0,Nice color. Fit as expected but not comfortable at all.
3.0,"I am tiny, and even if something is big, I can generally wear it.<br />Not this dress. Not flattering and not worth the money!"
3.0,ran small...for a child under 5.
3.0,"Very cute, but not big bitty friendly, if you catch my drift. If you’re bigger than a D or DD, it may be a questionable product"
3.0,Shiny material that does not look as high quality as I had expected.
3.0,"Super cute from the front, but the back looks pretty unfinished (you can clearly see where they knotted the string for the tassels/fringe)."
3.0,"Looks like the pictures but definitely not made of t-shirt material. Feels like stretchy spandex material, which is kind of odd. Looks cute. Feels weird."
3.0,This dress is adorable. I measured carefully and ordered according to the information given and the dress is too small/tight in chest and snug on hips.
3.0,"Looks very cheap- bumps in the metal. Quite heavy, but chain is very secure."
3.0,"I wish I loved this dress but I just couldn’t. I’m 5’7, 150 pounds and I ordered a large in black. The dress hung right above my ankles when I was actually hoping it was longer like most of the reviews stated.<br />The waist line hits at a weird place so I felt like it was unflattering. I don’t love the fabric either. It clings to areas that I don’t want it to cling to. I’m sad to have to return this dress."
3.0,"I ordered a small, normally wear a small and sometimes a medium. The dress was very short and hit me 4&#34; above the ankle, just a very odd length. I'm 5'6&#34;."
3.0,"I originally ordered these pants in the grey, & have LOVED them. I received the blue with the same expectations. I washed them before wearing (following the care instructions), but unfortunately found the blue pair to have shrunk dramatically in the length. Side by side, the blue pair now is just over 4"" shorter than the grey (which has held up beautifully). I'm tempted to buy the black (because of the great experience with the grey), but I'm a bit hesitant to find myself with another pair that I can't actually wear. I'm not sure what the difference is/was."
3.0,I was disappointed with the One Size for women.  I ordered these pants for my daughter to wear in a play(Aladdin).  She normally wears size 7 in juniors and these pants seemed small.  Considering they are supposed to be Baggy pants.
3.0,"I’m an hourglass, so the waist was a little too big and the bands were too small to hold anything in place. A cute top, but definitely made for someone with closer waist-to-boob measurements. 30’ and a DD for reference."
3.0,"I had to buy bra extenders because it was too tight around the chest. Other than that, the items are well worth the price and absolutely serve the purpose.<br />Thank you."
3.0,"I was really excited about this dress, but i am 5 feet 3 inches and this dress hit me right at my calves. i thought it would be a bit shorter. The material is pretty heavy. I only returned the dress because it was so long on me. Would really look great on someone taller."
3.0,I had got my normal size and it was kinda small... too tight 😫
3.0,"they are nothing like the picture, this are okay but it not what i was expecting"
3.0,"Feels low quality, feels like fake leather (but i'm not 100% sure)."
3.0,"Thankfully, all the reviews I read convinced me to order the next size. It fits well. The zipper, however, was damaged. Due to the popularity of this item with my little one, I was unable to return it for exchange. He is wearing it as a pull-over and not using the entire zipper. Needless to say, the price is a bit higher than the quality."
3.0,"Runs small, need to step up at least one size. Zipper on the left side."
3.0,"While it looks nice and wears great, it feels and is made unfinished. It seems good quality material but there is better and the making was not good quality.<br />Material is fairly rough and course. It's comfortable to wear and not really a reason for the 3 stars.<br /><br />The holes were punched out and unfinished. All holes still had material left inside them. The holes also were not sealed in any way. I recommend finish trimming the holes and take a soldering iron or hot poker and just dabbing into the hole to finish.<br /><br />This is an unfinished and half done product. If it wasn't for this issue I would give a 5. I'll fix it myself but should not have to. This could have been a great purchase otherwise but not worth the time to return it."
3.0,"Suit is ok, but not flattering on me. The top made me look like a round ball. I returned it."
3.0,Im gonna be honest about this. I ordered a large..basing myself on the reviews i saw that said it ran small. But i got a hugeeeeee blouse...i dont know if im gonna be wearing it :(
3.0,"They're cheap and basically disposable for the most part.  Wanted the green one the most, but guess which color didn't work on arrival?  Oh well, I suppose 1 bad one isn't horrible, but I gave them 3 stars simply due to that.  Things you purchase should work out of the box and without you having to change the battery.  Also, totally not worth shipping back to them just for the 1 band."
3.0,"It's an attractive shoe, but it was too wide for my narrow foot."
3.0,"Lovely colors, but the headbands don't stay put, have to fix continuously for comfort."
3.0,I guess it'll work fine since it fits well in the fingers but its very loose in the hand and wrists
3.0,It looked like a cute dress. It was kinda thin but wasn’t a big deal. It was very wrinkly so I put it in the dryer to just get the wrinkles out and it went from a dress to a oversized shirt… so I never got to wear it. So I advise not to dry it.
3.0,"Love the dress and it's cute, but it does run a little small.  I wore shapewear under it but had I got up just a size I wouldn't have needed to at all"
3.0,I liked the look and feel of this sports bra.  The biggest issue I had is that it was a bit too low cut to support my 36DD bust.  The material was nice quality and I did order 2 additional bras in different styles from the SYROKAN company and those fit great!
3.0,The nightie is cool<br />It’s just a lil too fitted<br />Love the pattern and texture
3.0,There are made of soft material but there made in China. The material is not  stretching and one mask is bigger than the other.
3.0,"I returned this dress because the style just did not look good on me. However it came just as described, material heavy better suited for colder months."
3.0,Not made that well. I’m almost afraid to wash it because the seems don’t look well put together. It’s cute but I don’t feel it will last long.
3.0,"It is a well made suit, just doesn't fit me as well as I would have liked. But would recommend the seller."
3.0,This is a very nice earcuff my only complaint is that it doesn't stay snug enough on the ear. Be sure to unbend the cuff before compressing it onto the upper ear.
3.0,"I really like the shirt. I just don't like the style of shirt that it is. I'm a tall woman and because of the type of tshirt it is, it's short on me. Would prefer a normal tshirt style"
3.0,"This tshirt is SUPER cute but I got the beige which is definitely a lighter yellow color and I ordered an XL expecting it to be a bit baggy and it fit like a large. It’s super soft though, and feels like good quality so I’m going to keep it anyway :)"
3.0,"Beautiful hat, just didn't fit my head."
3.0,"I love this dress! I wear a 14-16 size normally and the 2 XL fit perfectly! It is a bit thin, I bought it for a Halloween costume so I had to wear layers underneath to keep warm and I would be concerned that it is see through even though it is a double layered dress. Would be perfect for summer or a beach!"
3.0,Glasses were larger than expected. Made very well. Packaged very nicely. Made a great gift for my daughter :-)
3.0,"I am so sad. This swimsuit is amazing and I want to love it sooooo badly! I'm a taller girl and slim so was excited to find that it fit my body perfectly. I love the sheer center portion. It's very sexy and not made of rough fabric at all so it didn't feel scratchy. It comes with attachable straps so it can be worn as a halter or as a strapless suit. The only problem I had was that it comes with built in bra support, which normally is great but I'm not very well endowed. The cups are for quite big chests! The top section ended up looking very strange because I could not fill them out. This suit would be perfectly amazing if the cups were not so big or if they were at least removable or adjustable. I'm going to need to end up returning the suit because I can't wear it as it is which is so disappointing. It's only the chest area that is an issue. This suit is great for tall girls with large chests!"
3.0,"They are decent. The lenses are screwed on kinda wonky when you're looking at them up close & personal. Cute glasses over all though, I'll still wear them. They are VERY oversized"
3.0,Not happy!! 50$ and the eye cover isnt even attached to the mask but cant return it because my son wants it for Halloween! For this kind of money it should be broke!!
3.0,"Received them fairly quickly.  Not a variety as pictured though.  Only watermelon flavored.  Will work for our Mad Science party, but listing photo is misleading!!"
3.0,loved them but too small had to get next half size up
3.0,"Just ok, nothing to brag about."
3.0,"I really wanted to like this and there were lots of things I DID like. Let's start there.<br />1. Great color. It is a bit brighter than my screen resolution. Online it looks like a dark yellow verging on mustard. In real life it is more of a daffodil yellow. I like both so, yay.<br />2. The embroidery is colorful and looks super cute.<br />3.The fabric is some kind of light weight, silky synthetic. I think it would be very comfortable in warm weather. Since it is synthetic it might not be great in high heat & humidity b/c I don't know how well it breathes. However, the loose fit probably compensates for that.<br />4. I am 5'3&#34; and this hits just above my knee. Perfect length.<br /><br />I didn't like the way this looked on me and that's the only problem. It was a little too full. I wanted loose and flow-y. This just had a bit too much extra fabric and looked bulky on my frame--5'3&#34; & curvy. I see so much potential though so I ordered a very similar dress from the same vendor w/out the stripes on the bottom. It has embroidery on the bottom and I chose the dark teal/turquoise--maybe a different color will look better on me."
3.0,"Took the advice from everyone and ordered a size larger, but it wasn't necessary. I'm 5'7 150 lbs, and fit. It fits me larger than needed and the fabric is not strong enough to be considered compression."
3.0,"Dress rides up a bit, way different than picture and had to keep holding my dress down"
3.0,Was smaller than stated. Had to put a few stitches in it
3.0,"When I first got these leggings they were too small and I had to return them for the next size up. They are very comfortable, but the top tends to roll down a lot which can get quite annoying. The material is thin so I would not recommend it for winter weather. I like these leggings, but they ripped after having them for a month on the leg. So the quality is a bit iffy. I really want to love these leggings but with them rolling down and the rip, I dont think I would recommend them."
3.0,"Soft and comfortable, but I don't know if it's my body type or what, but it looks dreadful on me. It hangs oddly off my backside compared to other dresses I own."
3.0,Didn't last long cracked at the top line frame
3.0,I wanted to love this blouse by RIOTOBE short sleeve blouse for spring and summer.it surprised me when I could not button the bottom buttons.  I seems my middle body has enlarged with age so this blouse was a disappointment.  Loved the silky material and the neutral color but not willing to wear it as seems way too tight.  It says it is a plus size but designed too tight in the middle.  For plus size should have been more flowing and good fit.  Every Senior Citizen will have to check closely to find clothes that will fit our body.
3.0,I am a 180 size 14. size L top fit perfect but bottoms had to be thrown away. the bottoms are incredibly tiny.
3.0,I dont like the way it clings to me. Shows my  shape too much. I thought it would be loose and flowing.
3.0,Straps are too big and unfortunately they're not adjustable and returns aren't free.
3.0,"The seam on the inner thigh  from below the crotch to above the knee was completely missing.  Looked like the bobbin in the machine had run empty.  I have a sewing machine, so was able to fix it, otherwise would have had to return them.  Had to restitch a couple  other seams that looked like they could fail, but this was only on the straight seams.  The decorative seams along the outside of the legs were perfect.  If you order these, be sure to check the stitching to make sure it is intact."
3.0,"Very cute! My boyfriend and I have had our nipples pierced about 3-4 weeks, we put these in and were in so much pain we had to change them again. We will use them again next year for Halloween."
3.0,I was hoping for something more teal - this is more green. The size fits my needs nicely and it is sheer (like the picture shows). I plan on using it as a beach cover-up so I might sew up the sides a little. I love the print!
3.0,Very Cute.<br />But don't last long.<br />Lasted about a month. After the material unwound from the wire.
3.0,"I was hoping these were &#34;clamp on&#34;, instead are &#34;pin on&#34;.  I pin them to my nursing badge."
3.0,A bit tight around the waist but still comfortable
3.0,Cute slippers but my feet slide right through them. I think they are made for wide feet not medium or narrow.
3.0,The charm is nice but disappointed there were no threads like pandora charms have to hold in place.  The charm comes off when I take the braclet off.
3.0,This is a lapel pin and  broach.<br />I thought it was a trophy award
3.0,"The watch arrived in perfect condition and nice quality. Watch comes with box, papers and cleaning cloth. Nice presentation. But, the watch does not keep time and unacceptable unfortunately.. It’s being returned."
3.0,Wouldn't recommend ad a tutu top-- can see thru it :(
3.0,"I'll love the color and fashion,  runs large fits me more like an 10.5 I'm a 10 . When wearing feels loose should have gotten the 9.5 hey didn't know."
3.0,Let it air out as soon as it arrives. It is plastic...which tends to have a scent frosh out of the bag.
3.0,Definitely feels like i sweat way more when im wearing them. Very flattering and holds you in.
3.0,The big problem here is that most of the reviews have nothing to do with the product (a wrist watch) being advertised. Misleading scores...
3.0,"i use these gloves for lacrosse practice, and if only wore on glove while it was cold, they would end up ripping from contact with other teammates. so instead i starting wearing 2 pairs, but i was disappointed that they ripped during practice."
3.0,"They are clear plastic on the material over the initial... look a little cheap when taking a close look.  But, they were cheap, so got what I paid for."
3.0,"The original band that came with my Umdigi SmartWatch3 fitness tracker (the pink one at the top) is notched where the pin fits into the frame of the watch, but the replacement band (the Yellow one at the bottom) is not.  Therefore the band does not fit into the pin receptacle.  I was able to overcome this problem by removing the pins that came with the replacement bands, slicing a small notch into each end of the band so that they replicated the notches in the original band, and then placing the original pins into the replacement bands.  Not so easy for this 70 year old woman with shaky hands and burry eyes to do, but it worked!!!  And the replacement band colors are simply gorgeous.  Now all I have to do is get some replacement pins that are the right length, as the pins that came with the replacement bands are just a silly millimeter or two too long."
3.0,"Cute relaxed fit, BUT the color was nothing even close to the picture advertised. It is more of a pale mustard yellow. The button holes are sewn shut."
3.0,"It's a very nice outfit but the tag says XXL and fits like a medium, i'm actually trying to sell it. It's very small fitting."
3.0,The warmer rolls up when it is out on and so it doesn't work all that great when you put it on it needs a seam at the top
3.0,I like the material and style of these shorts . I ordered gray and the color is very light and looks more like a very pale khaki.  They run super small- I usually wear a 12 and had to get an XL.
3.0,Tiene varios puntas que tienden a rayar un poco
3.0,"Light weight, but “tips over” easily, so I  need to always be sure that it’s completely  zipped up because I have lost stuff that has fallen out. Zippers/zipper pulls are just a little too big as well"
3.0,Sizing off for the size it should be
3.0,"It is not an 11 it is 2 sizes smaller. So sad and disappointed, it is to late to reorder she was supposed to wear them for Christmas production tomorrow that she's in, at least I have backup."
3.0,"The scarf is smaller than any blanket scarf I own. I should have read the specified dimensions. I just assumed that it was the size of a typical blanket scarf like the 10 other designs I have. Overall the quality is ok, and the colors are great. Just not the best size for a blanket scarf."
3.0,"Very cute dress but you have to be well endowed up top for this dress to fit you well. I wear a 34B. It doesn’t matter how I tie or tape it, it just doesn’t fit. I wear a button up sweater over it and completely cover the top just so the dress isn’t a waste."
3.0,When we received the shirt the were in adult sizes. So I would advise to size down because they were very long on my kids.
3.0,I purchased this top for yoga. I was pleased with the purchase but it may have been after a wash and dry that I found the fit too small and I reordered to the larger size.
3.0,Fit good I must say but product is not original polo cap
3.0,"Pretty metal, but the hinge is a little tough to open and close. Be careful if your piercing is still a bit new or tender."
3.0,If I don't wear it everyday it stops. Great looking watch.
3.0,"Had a hard time opening clasps on a lot of the earring, thought for sure I was going to break one, lucky I didn't.  They seem pretty sturdy.  Would have rated them higher if not for the difficulty opening clasps, its like they apply a clear coat on earring with them closed."
3.0,The shape was cute but the crop was too short for me!
3.0,Base is small..when my baby walks he gets imbalanced. Quality of the product is also not up to my expectations
3.0,"We ordered these reader sunglasses to replace some others that we bought locally.  The sunglasses are comfortable & block the sun nicely, however we had a hard time reading with the ""bifocal reader"" part.  We think it has to do with the blue/green colored lenses.  Our other reader sunglasses were the brownish lenses & they work fine.  We did order another set of the brownish lense readers & they work great for us."
3.0,"Great price...decent quality...a little too shiny for what we wanted, but will definitely use them"
3.0,"I let my sister choose a gift on here and she chose this purse, cheep quality and cheep price. Also it smelled like a bunch of chemicals, but the smell went away after a bit and she used it like the typical girl where it was fun for a bit then she forgot all about it."
3.0,Didn't fit like my other Nike shirts - not as comfortable - sizing seemed a bit off
3.0,This shirt shrunk at the first wash
3.0,"This dress didnt fit as I expected it to, maybe it was my body type IDK. I gave it to a friend and they loved it. I got a medium"
3.0,"Had to cut the eye holes bigger - definitely made for someone who has a short face/small head (and that's saying something, as I have a pretty small noggin/face).  Also, the chin strap compresses your face when smiling, making it very unflattering - I cut it off. After said adjustments were made, the mask fits fine."
3.0,"If this is XL, I'll eat it instead of trying to wear it. Normally, reviews for clothes ask about the fit-- whether it was as expected, or too small, or too big. This one didn't, and I find that curious because this &#34;XL&#34; shirt is WAY smaller than any XL I've ever owned. It felt more like a medium/large. I checked the tag, though... Yep, it says XL. Then why does it not even fit me when most XL shirts are a little big on me? I mean, this couldn't even accommodate my shoulders and chest.<br /><br />Normally, I really like Amazon branded offerings, but I have to call this one honestly and say they need to re-think their sizing if this is an XL. Maybe I got one with a screwed-up size label? I don't know. All I know is that this shirt, an alleged XL, was so tight it was in danger of ripping on my frame. As comparison, I'm wearing a different XL shirt right now and it's loose in the midsection, free in the shoulders, and the collar fits around my neck with room to spare, so I know it's not because I'm somehow bigger than an XL (I'm definitely not; I'm closer to a Large, but with a little more shoulder and chest). The shirt I'm reviewing had none of those traits-- it was tight in the midsection, tight in the chest, barely fit my shoulders, short in the sleeves, and I couldn't button the top because the neck-hole was simply too small. I strongly suspect this is a Large/Slim that was mis-labeled as an XL.<br /><br />I'm going to give this three &#34;It's Okay&#34; stars, because despite the fit, the quality, look, and feel of the shirt are all top-notch. This is just a case of the sizing being completely, utterly wrong for some reason. My suggestion is to order one or two sizes larger if you want to give this shirt a go. I think I'd probably love it if it were sized properly, but unfortunately there's no way I can wear this shirt, in this size, for any length of time unless I have surgery to remove my shoulders and take out a few ribs.<br /><br />I do see in the description above that there's a brief and tiny mention of it being &#34;non-stretch slim fit&#34;, but that's nowhere on the label. It only says XL. And I'm sorry, but there's a difference between slim and petite, and this thing is for guys who have no shoulders or chest, and no body fat whatsoever. If you have muscles, or even the tiniest spare tire, this is not going to fit.<br /><br />So... bottom line: Order a bigger size than you normally wear and you should be quite happy, and if you're an exceptionally narrow-framed, skinny guy, this is your shirt."
3.0,Too small!  Ordered a size up and still too small. It fit but tightly!
3.0,Fits snuggly but straps are shorter than I wanted.
3.0,The material is nice and they fit (knee to ankle) just fine. They just aren't tight enough to provide any compression. Had to return.
3.0,"The dress is a great price for the product.  Material was pretty thick and comfortable with plenty of stretch.  The bottom fit great but unfortunately, the top was a bit too large.  I wouldn't suggest ordering unless you have a larger bust to fill out the top.  It may have been ok with double sided tape but I didn't want to take the chance of the girls falling out."
3.0,I like the color and how many sequins are on it. But the sequins around the arm holes rub my arm and make them hurt after wearing the shirt for a while.
3.0,The items itself fit great. Notice a peeling on it and it’s turn sliver. I really wish I didn’t have to buy another one.
3.0,"Gloves were as expected. However, took a very long time to arrive."
3.0,"More like Lapel pins not tie tacs. The actual price tags were left on the package, which was much less than I actually paid! I should have looked around a bit longer, I paid double the price it appears."
3.0,"I bought these for my 82 year old FIL. I was hopeful as these looked similar to the grip socks worn in the hospital. My FIL is 5'6 and between 250 and 300 lbs. I say between as his legs are swelling like tree trunks. I thought for sure an XXL sock would accommodate  his severely swollen ankles and feet. We couldn't pull these socks over the arch of the foot. Unfortunately I cannot give an honest review on comfort or durability since we had to try a different brand. But if you have a loved one with extremely  swollen tree trunk legs and feet, the XXL still might not be big enough."
3.0,Short but larger in fit. I won't be able to wear it how I originally planned to. Doesn't fit quite like the picture shows.
3.0,"Could have been cute, arrived with the flower squashed, which may have been able to be trained back into place somehow... Only the handle (not sure if it's enamel or plastic) is cracked. Giving three stars because the product is cute, but the shipping/delivery/packaging definitely needs improvement."
3.0,Nice sweater but it was way too small and I ordered a large one size up.  I would suggest 2 to 3 sizes up.
3.0,Does not fit well and very uncomfortable. Not true to soze
3.0,"If you walk around the block in these there will be holes in the bottom. I tried these out in order to cover up my walking boot for my broken foot, the idea is great but I wish they were a bit more durable"
3.0,to big.
3.0,I guess i should've read the description more. I thought it would be more than a pouch.
3.0,"I am glad I finally found earrings that I can tolerate in my helix piercing, I was ready to let it close up, until I saw a tik tok recommendation on these.  I was missing some earrings from what the product image shows and they are so hard to unscrew the back.  I won't be changing them anytime soon."
3.0,"When I first received these, I was skeptical.  After wearing them a few times, I really like them.  They have a nice spandex type inner liner and the shorts material is odd like a soft raincoat.  It's hard to explain, but I like it.  It has nice zippered pockets that can hold a lot if needed.  It also has a phone pocket on the inner liner that is just big enough for my iPhone 12 Pro.  I like that the phone pocket sits high on the thigh as it is not flopping around when running.  It is quite comfortable.  I don't usually bring my phone on a run because I have music on my Garmin, but these shorts make that prospect a lot more appealing.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After a couple of weeks and wearing these a few times, one of the zippered pockets will not zip anymore.  It isn't something stuck in the zipper.  The zipper has come apart at the bottom and will no longer engage.  I still think they are nice shorts, but this is disappointing."
3.0,These are NOT made for extreme cold. I ride motorcycles and it was 44° today and felt like 32°...my hands were very cold by mile 5. These are a lightweight glove not made for prob colder than 45°
3.0,Weird fit. A little frumpy. Wish it was a little longer.
3.0,The quality is great! The fit is way off. I wear a M at the Gap and Old Navy for reference. Will be returning the L and buying the XL. We’ll see how that works out!
3.0,"I tried the Large and I was too big, so I decided the Medium and got the right fit. I decided to keep it and washed it, now I have a really tight and short jacket even my wife can’t wear. I liked the quality and color but really dissatisfied overall."
3.0,"This band is pretty, but the rose gold color was way too bright for my Fossil watch face."
3.0,"Super cute jacket, extremely cheap materials"
3.0,"I really love the style of this dress, but the material was of lower quality than I expected. Pretty print but the color is more like a darker beige."
3.0,The run small. Not that great of quality
3.0,"I got the smallest size available, and I feel like I’m drowning in this cardigan. It feels bulky, and the side pockets hit everyone who tries it on in the worst place, making hips and butt look big. The shoulders slouch a ways below my actual shoulders, adding to the frumpiness of the look. The knit is soft, which is good, and the color is a nice heather gray, but I feel like there are very few people that this would look good on."
3.0,Too small for my use as studs in a split ear
3.0,The ordered a large and the top is wide open. I am not sure about the fabric but it is not soft and flowing as expected. Still looks kind of cute so I will keep it.
3.0,The bottom fit perfectly but the top fits like a lil girl that it belongs to. The top is to tight and it’s no for adults
3.0,"Super cute dress! I'm a little between sizes. Some things I'm a med, some things I'm a large, and some times neither really fit me as one is too big and one is too small. I went with the safe bet on this one and ordered the large. It's totally adorable. But this dress hangs off me. Also the waistline is so light up if I had got a medium I'm assuming it would have been even shorter. The waist needs to be a solid couple inches lower on me, and a couple inches drawn in as well. As the whole look of this dress is dependant on the waist pretty much. Also, just a tiny side note, the material isn't my favorite either. For a summer dress it doesn't breath well."
3.0,"They cut up in the hooch a little, but they pretty much fit true to size in my opinion because I ordered a small. I have a long torso (maybe that's why?) and they hit right at the belly button. Thin, but not see through.  Feel comfortable in them at home, but would not wear them out in public. I ordered black too, and I feel like they rise a little higher, but still cut the cooch. Just not as noticeable bc they're black."
3.0,Got this dress for my engagement photoshoot but decided to find something else. This dress looked  nice. It did take me like ten minutes to figure out how to wear it. You stick the string through a litte  hole on the right seam. Once I figured that out It looked good on me. The problem is that it’s made out of a thin material and you can see everything.
3.0,I do not think the hat is well made.  The material seems on the cheap side.
3.0,"I ordered a small and medium. Kept the medium since with some fitted sweater materials, I prefer the medium fit to avoid the bra strap lines and can half dry to shrink in dryer the slight looseness from medium and it still not be really fitted."
3.0,"Really cute, but it shows a little more of my booty than I had expected (i.e. the ruffle is lower in the front and higher in the back."
3.0,"Had an almost identical version of this navel ring from an online store years ago. Despite other review and warnings I bought it in the hope it was the same. It is a nice piece visually but, unfortunately I'm running into the same problem other did, it will not lay flat! You have to continually pull the barbell down so it sits, as flat as it can, as opposed to hanging at an angle. If you're ok with that, you'll be fine with the buy. In my opinion, it's a little steep price wise considering such a big flaw."
3.0,Get a size larger and expect them to still be short<br />If you don’t mind your little girl walking around in short shorts they’re really cute we now just put them under dresses
3.0,Looks a little thin and odd from the opposite side.  It still cute
3.0,Not as long as I would've like it otherwise nice dress.
3.0,These are my favorite sunglasses although I've had to replace twice in a short amount of time. First time the frame broke. Second time skull fell off
3.0,FYI this is not a heavyweight T-shirt. Material is rather thin for a T-shirt.
3.0,"After reading all the reviews that these run small, I bought a size larger.  They fit, 1/2 size smaller would be best, but I don't think they make 1/2 sizes.  I don't find them comfortable either.  Maybe because they are  1/2 size small.  If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't buy them."
3.0,"the backs on the earrings were bent, which caused them to sometimes be painful to put in/ take out,<br />however size is nice and i love the earring otherwise."
3.0,"Nice quality, but unless you want you midsection visible, this is a ""pass"".<br />Really look at the pics....they clearly show a cropped top."
3.0,Too small. 😢
3.0,"It's extremely beautiful very well-crafted good quality but as far as it has magical powers I doubt it, maybe in the ancient times they had a certain virtue to them, but that's about it it's very nice to have as a collection don't expect you will get something magical or out of the ordinary, I bought two of them so far and I might end up buying a third one, like I said there is nothing magical about them. If at some point in the future I was to discover something xtraordinary about them I will redo my review, it is very beautiful well embroidered and well-crafted, very beautiful to have but please do not get gas up like you will get something with high magical effect. You probably go mad."
3.0,"This Dress was return for credit, It was Too Large."
3.0,"First of all, these earrings are HUGE. I like big earrings but these were next level. They looked silly on because they were so big.<br />When I pulled them out of the packaging, several beads were already off and there were loose threads around the edges."
3.0,"look great, but ankles a little small. Don't last long, but kind of expected that"
3.0,"Nice looking and good quality. My problem on them was the shorts where too tight, and shoulder straps too big. Easy to return no hassles and free return.  I would purchase from them again."
3.0,Runs well & looks good.  But a little too tight for my wrist!
3.0,The white asuka color I ordered was polyester and not cotton as advertised. Runs very large. Have two of these tops in buffalo plaid and the asuka is a completely different shirt. Returned.
3.0,"Necklace tangles very easy, spent the whole day untangling it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:2e800dce3d2741748b053c62ddf3a3c2]] Not exactly the color red. It’s more of a faded red even in the darkest of rooms. I have the yellow and green masks and they’re phenomenal but the red is major disappoint.
3.0,Shoulders were snug
3.0,Cheap and not worth the price.
3.0,good suit just really tight in the waist
3.0,"These are much smaller than I expected. That was my only disappointment, but it is substantial when you put them on."
3.0,Smaller then it looks much smaller
3.0,The pants are beautiful but very very small! A large is like a size 2 ... this pants are for very skinny girls with zero curves!...  they dont stretch at all.
3.0,"This top is adorable but the straps hooks (if that makes sense) in the back are flimsy. One of them snapped immediately so I either got the wrong size or it wasn’t made very well. Maybe a mix of both. Since you can tighten the straps, maybe buy larger and hope it works out better next time."
3.0,The dress was pretty but very high waisted.  I prefer a high waist but too high with pockets hitting almost at rib cage.
3.0,"Loved the pattern so much but it fit too small and was very uncomfortable. I was unable to wear it out.  I felt like that one girl in the ""white chicks"" movie when shes trying on clothes. Did not fit."
3.0,Too bad they aren't as nice as the box they come in. Perhaps spend less on the box and more on quality glasses. Really nice box though. Much wow.
3.0,"I like that they can come off and be re-attached.  The lenses that come with the package are very large and it is hard to cut them down to size.  The is no guide for that.  I would like it if they made them in different sizes.<br />It was a bit difficult to attach while wet, because they kept moving around while I tried to get the air bubbles out.  I did manage it after several tries.  The lenses are stronger than expected and I would order the next strength down next time."
3.0,"This is not true to size, it was too small for me."
3.0,Very beautiful. Smaller than I expected and so shallow it barely holds anything.
3.0,"While these shorts are comfortable, there is stitching in the front of the shorts that runs from the each side, just under the pockets, to the inseam. I am not sure why it is designed that way, but it looks like the two parts were separately made and then stitched together. Everything else is great otherwise, it is just that design..."
3.0,They are ok. Look good. Very inexpensive and they feel that way
3.0,"I like the material, which is is soft and nice and washed well.  The color is wine and white instead of red and white as I had expected.  I ordered this pajama mostly because it said the pants had side pockets, which is a feature I really like and is not easy to find...however, the pants do not have pockets."
3.0,No se le parece en nada a los colores originales
3.0,"cute top, has a clingy smaller fit at the waist line that i didn't expect.  tie straps at shoulders are longer than needed and stretch easity.  bottom has nice flare and is longer than a tshirt."
3.0,"Well it comes in a greasy looking bag that I assume is supposed to be clear but is a bit hazy. I do have to admit that I have large hands. I wear a ring size of 15 and have trouble with most gloves. These ran equally as small. Being from a company in China I anticipated this, but XL was the only size they had that would come even relatively close to what I needed. The price was unbeatable. 10.00 and they match my uniform color perfectly. I've got a match coming up on the 27th of next month so we will see how the grip feels after all day use."
3.0,Great fit and unique looking socks. Love them!
3.0,Of the case. But it's starting to fall apart.  I haven't had it that long. It shouldn't be falling apart already!
3.0,"It's not for 18 months, more like 1 year max"
3.0,Fit hubby good but they creep up on him.
3.0,I ordered two of these dresses.  The material of the stripe one was much nicer than the solid one.
3.0,"These are adorable and well made kid shoes. Only problem is my daughter complained that they hurt her heel (around her ankle in back) after having them on no more than 2 minutes. She loved how they looked so much that she was upset to have me send them back. The back edge around the heel is stiff and rough. She was wearing socks and they still cut into her. Despite how pretty they are, I can't have my kid in uncomfortable shoes! Perhaps a larger size might help, but I'm going to just try another brand."
3.0,It was a lot larger than I expected. Too big to be worn on my Doberman's collar. Like the idea- wish I hadn't bought.
3.0,Was made in Taiwan and I don't think it was made with cared.
3.0,"I felt like there was some kind of film on the glasses that I couldn’t get off. It impacted my vision. Otherwise, they were super cute and the cases were a great addition."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:7966d707c441ae8e0baf2f855ed68551]] Well it's a better nockoff than the ones from WISH. It's ok quality. Smaller than the real thing from the Goorin Bros. And it comes in a bag all crushed and looking like it got ran over.
3.0,Love love LOVE this purse. The coloring on the top is wearing off though so it's starting to look a bit sad. Got the matching wallet and it's great.
3.0,I would choose one size bigger than your actual size.
3.0,They are made consistent as all Silicone bands. However they are not as vibrant as pictured. I will publish pictures later.
3.0,This is a nice shirt but it fits somewhat small
3.0,It is ok for the cost.  It just short on me.  I am 5'7&quot; and it's not floor length.
3.0,"It is ok, the belt seems to hold my pants up very well."
3.0,Not impressed with the fit. I usually go between a medium and large. 5 8 & 135 lbs and this was super small on bottom and huge on top. Returning.
3.0,They fit slightly strange. You could wear them either way and your not sure what is the front and back. For a one day use they’re okay but if your planning on wearing them more often maybe not?
3.0,"I like the feel of the material and the colors. It would be nice to have a shoulder strap that was not detachable as you have to put the handles inside the purse and then it does not close well. Also, I wish it had areas for cell phone, etc. rather than one big pocket."
3.0,"The waist elastic is up high, it give a maternity look. And the pockets are up high as well. I am 5'5"". The fabric is not as soft as similar dresses Ive bought on Amazon"
3.0,Everything was perfect. It just didn’t come with the belt ..
3.0,"Fit great! But waaaaay to short to be a dress, way too long to be a blouse. Unfortunately I accidentally bought two then missed the dates to return them. I do love the beautiful white pattern. Nice quality material, well made. I’m 5’7 and I could never sit down in this dress."
3.0,The merchandise was fine! I'm satisfied! Thanks!
3.0,"I ordered this in burgundy and it came in a slightly lighter color than I expected, and the gem stones on the dress did fall off multiple times"
3.0,"Really liked the design and the print. However, I have american boobs and this was too small for them. The weather-report hiding pads in the top are also molded more like half-dome shoulder pads. So in conclusion, if I had smaller (than 38 DD) boobs it would have been a lovely suit to romp around in. (Best guess for moderate coverage largest chest size is maybe a mid-C?) Sadly I sent it back and am continuing my hunt for a tummy hiding, boob covering and lifting suit that I can feel somewhat confident in while being bounced around on a boat or laying around on the sand. Not a complicated laundry list. The seams are also weak. I would guess that the suit wouldn't make it past one season of wear. Give it one time of trying to wiggle out of a damp suit and I would guess you would have some seams breaking."
3.0,"The horns are okay, but they require a bit of work if you want them to look good. There’s a lot of foam hang off and overall they looked pretty messy until I cleaned them up. Another issue is one is comically a different shape than the other 😂 wasn’t noticeable at first but it’s very noticeable in pictures especially from the front"
3.0,It’s nice and not too dark but the glasses are big so they slide off my face if I look down
3.0,I have purchased the L and they are were a little firm but the XL seem to be 2 sized larger than the L.
3.0,I have many pieces from Lizzy James ordered directly.  This piece was made of different medal and I found it to subpar in quality.
3.0,"This lighted jewelry box made the necklace I gave a a gift even more special. The way it lit up the item made it sparkle and the recipient also lit up with amazement. The quality was fine and it displayed the item well. My only complaint is that the price was very expensive in my opinion. With a lower price, I would give it 5 stars!!!"
3.0,"I was so excited about this dress but it doesn't look like the picture at all!! The tie dye is really inconsistent, it was almost completely black in the front but white in the back and it was really oddly long. It wasn't flattering at all either and the loose part on top doesn't hit at the waist like it does on the model. Don't waste your time ordering this one."
3.0,"It's and okay buy, but fits large. Material is not warm. Buy only if the weather is more springy than wintery."
3.0,Much smaller than I had anticipated.
3.0,"Necklace is okay, would not purchase again."
3.0,"Granddaughter looked so cute for her 1st birthday party, but straps were too long.  I had to pin in back."
3.0,The top fit was large for my 38Ds.
3.0,The gold changes to more of a pink gold after a week of wearing it. It is super cute and I like everything except coloring.
3.0,It looks nice and it comfortable but its very hard to open and if you try to slip it on without opening it pops off the way it attaches is poor quality its almost like the little pin isn't long enough or something
3.0,"Nice and sparkly, fun to wear it, though it is a bit skinny and stiff. Would love if it is more chunky and brighter in tone. Not elegant. For kids this is fine, not sophisticating enough for adults."
3.0,Only purchase if you have tiny wrists. Otherwise it's going to be too tight. Very pretty though.
3.0,Does what it is suppose to do..I use it riding motorcycle works well for that .you always have a mask in a mask society
3.0,"All is true with the description except I bought this jacket for biking it fit good for a large except the sleeves, very short for the size.<br />It also took the longest to get from any order from Amazon? After looking at the shipping it bounced around in Illinois for quite a while?<br />Still haven’t decided if I’m going to send back.<br />Research product to see if they have a tall version."
3.0,Material is very soft like it si much but size runs small
3.0,"The sweater is very warm. The fabric is good and soft but a little heavy. It is an oversized sweater and kind of too big and too long. But it is comfortable. I am not sure if I like the inside-out looking of this sweater though. Overall, it is nice for cold winter."
3.0,The fabric is not what I spected.<br />For the price<br />5hank you
3.0,It was great the first hour.  After that the push up aspect went away.
3.0,"I love the flowers on this shirt. They are beautiful and the shirt has a vintage feel to it. I hate the sleeves, though. The elastic on the wrists is super irritating. My husband and children don't like the look of the sleeves either. It looks beautiful on the page, but in person, it just looks weird. Between the sheer sleeves and the elastic cuffs, it just doesn't work for me. I do think it will look beautiful as a sleeveless shirt, so I'm going to do my best to alter it a bit. I can't wear this shirt with the sleeves, but the flowers are too lovely to let it go to waste.<br /><br />There's a sheer outer layer(which is scratchy), but also an inner layer(which shields the scratchiness). Despite the two layers, you can still see through it if you have on a dark bra, so pair it with a skin colored bra or a cami if modesty is desired. As far as fit goes, I normally wear a medium to large, and this medium fits me fine. I think the shoulder area would be too big if I'd gone up in size."
3.0,"The glasses make the world look less gloomy, but wearing orange lens looks odd. They need to make blueblockers with a normal sunglasses tint."
3.0,"The jeans looked bigger than expected as soon as I took them out of the bag. I tried them on and I was right. I was able to Try them on with jeans underneath (as shown) which should tell you that the jeans were loose enough. I also expected them to be shorter in length with they are compared to my skinny jeans, but they are not as short as pictured. I wouldn't even consider them as petite fit. I ordered a 38 for these. The product page says to order 2 sizes bigger (I'm a 36 according to their size chart) so I got the 40 first. But I also ordered 38 just in case I wanted a tighter fit. The 38 fit too big I can't imagine how big the 40s would have been. They have a stretch to them also. So go with your exact size imo. If I had bought the 36 it would have fit my legs and body better. I'm still not sure about the length of the jean. But I'll see after I try on the 36."
3.0,"there are many different options, all fit my neck well too. after few wears though, they do break 😅 some hold on longer than others, overall they’re cute for a lil picture but maybe not for everyday wear. :-)"
3.0,Gave as a gift.  She really cherished it.
3.0,I wish I liked it more...it just doesn’t look like an adult jewelry piece more like a child bracelet you can get it at Claire’s or something...looks so cheap (well it is cheap) and it wouldn’t look good with my work outfit or even workout outfit..
3.0,I order the Small.  Medium would have fit better.
3.0,"This shirt is really big on me. I love Allegra K clothing and everything else I have ordered fits great. I was going to return it, but decided to keep it. I will probably wear it as a dress."
3.0,"It’s alright , its actually not soft at all , I really thought it will be soft it’s pretty dry , it’s not that comfortable to wear"
3.0,Bunch little stuff. Not good for 6 year old
3.0,"Unsure about this material, the cut isn't right, it flares out way too much and doesn't hang or drape well."
3.0,Same times him take the hair out
3.0,"The frame I received was not nearly as colorful as the one pictured, so I was disappointed. My frame does look okay with the black band, so I didn't return it."
3.0,Useful and attractive
3.0,Smaller in width than I anticipated
3.0,cute but very fragile can do without it
3.0,"Very nice style, looked great on.  While not mirrored, the fact that they were polarized was a great benefit."
3.0,"It's comfy, not too heavy.  But the stitching is already falling apart after a short time."
3.0,Its sticks out very noticeable.
3.0,"Although the crystals are very pretty, the earrings are smaller than I like.  I'll be using them as a gift for a friend who likes the smaller-sized earrings."
3.0,Don’t buy these if you have a fat neck 😂 I was unaware of said fat neck until I received these.
3.0,El plástico de enfrente es muy delgado se dobla y se le pega al rostro del niño y eso le molesta y se quita la gorra.
3.0,cute earrings but rather small a little hard to put on but they're worth what you paid for them
3.0,"It does the job but you get what you pay. Not a quality tool set. It is good to change batteries, but the half of the set is garbage."
3.0,Worn maybe 6-7x and the felt-like material on the pointed toe is already worn completely off. Cheaply made.
3.0,The dress is adorable however the slip thing underneath is shorter than the outer layer. The outer layer was a bit short so it might have worked but with the inner layer being so short I couldn't make it work. If you have smaller butt though maybe you won't have a problem. Definitely sad because it's adorable
3.0,Sports bra is cut a narrow in front. Side support is very light.  Design is cute though.
3.0,They have other products better with red wings.
3.0,"I wore this dress to a wedding and wish I had gone with the other dress I was looking at.  I will say it was flattering I liked the pattern but it was not quite what I was expecting.  The dress pictured is of a higher quality the material for the dress is cheap, stretchy material similar to a Halloween costume.  The pattern looks good from a distance but up close it does look a bit cheap.  I’ll be keeping it because it’s comfortable and a decent dress to wear to the beach or for a casual weekend."
3.0,"The material is very thin, you can see anything underneath it. On the top if you wear it without a bra you can see absolutely everything no problem. It is very poor material. Super disappointing because the design is ADORABLE."
3.0,this ring is way prettier in person but has started to tarnish already
3.0,The straps cause the dress to sit a little high on the chest.
3.0,Work once and it split the front seam.
3.0,"Ok I bought this kit just to go up one size 2g to 0g. The tapers work well, they did what they were suppose to do. But. The plugs that comes with it the groove for the o ring is so shallow that it just falls off. Thank goodness that I had also already bought 0g plugs because the o ring just falls off. Heads up to anyone else."
3.0,I buy a lot of Amazon clothing and this was made with substandard very sheer fabric.  couldn't even send it back...
3.0,Runs large and the material is spandex
3.0,Small/medium ..should just be a medium or make a xs/s
3.0,Cute suit but larger than I imagined
3.0,Beautiful shirt but way too small.  This is the second item I've ordered from Orvis and have been very disappointed.  Should have learned my lesson the first time.  This was on sale so I am just donating it to charity instead of returning it.
3.0,Rotates too much in the mounting hole. Overpriced too
3.0,Soft sweater but if snags very easy.
3.0,I loved the color but this shirt was Very small and thin material.
3.0,It was good quality but was too big.
3.0,Comfortable and quite harm but they slip of the heel despite being my exact size.
3.0,I loved this shirt but it was too small even after following the size chart. So make sure to size way up!
3.0,"A little big and bulky for me. I had an old pair that I loved but lost, and this was replacement. Eventually found my old pair (yay!) and use these as a backup."
3.0,let's not get too excited over socks!
3.0,"Way too small, I had to return it."
3.0,"Fully extended, these are a tight fit over my head.  I'm 6' 1"".  The ones I've been using for years for sunglasses are 21"" to 22"" length when extended.  These are only 14"" when fully extended.  The ends of my glasses are up near my Adam's Apple."
3.0,"Not sure if it was a mistake or false advertising but I only recieved one, not 2."
3.0,"I like the overall look and fit of this bra.  It did take about 3-4 weeks to arrive...I actually forgot that I ordered it because it took so long!  It had weird padding in it when it arrived, which is easily removable and quickly thrown in the trash.  I am a 34D and ordered a medium.  I found it to have good support and it gave me modest cleavage--not over the top for the gym, but also not uni-boob.  It does have a seam right down the front of each cup.  It looked very strange when the padding was in it, but almost invisible once I took the pads out.  The back looks super cute.  I'm thinking about ordering another color....and I'll be surprised when I get a package in another 3-4 weeks.  :)"
3.0,"I like the color but i was looking for some big ball earrings. you really have to make sure you pic a good size!, the backs really do suck tho you have to be careful or you'll loose them"
3.0,"its beautiful, but NOT the color shown.  its black with blue sequins.  Not going to work for my mom, but can regift it to a daughter in law"
3.0,Bought this for my daughter to use w her softball uniform shirt. Works ok.
3.0,"A few were duds but most of them worked. The rubber bands are pretty tight on my fingertips so not very comfortable. (My finger are not large.) But they were still fun to play with. Oddly enough I found myself loving them as mini flashlights especially while camping. With all the other junk I carry around in my pockets, it's nice to have something so useful be so tiny and in pretty colors. My nieces and nephews thought they were really cool."
3.0,"La tela no es de buena calidad, no es como se ve en la imagen."
3.0,purchased 2 sizes bigger - still does not provide the right coverage for curvy / busty girls.
3.0,"These are lightweight glasses, but they don't work for me. They are designed to stand away from the face to prevent condensation, but I worry about insects (lots of gnats where I live) getting under the glasses. Also they are not as large as I would like, and don't wrap around as much. When I put them on I was very conscious of the lower rim in my vision field. Overall, not a good fit for me. Returning them, disappointed as they were a reasonable price and the company does good outreach. My first attempt at buying sunglasses on-line, won't do that again. I appreciate the return policy."
3.0,"If you’re looking for a robe to lounge in, this is great. Not so good to dry yourself after a shower. Also I was hoping it would be longer."
3.0,"Looked good on, but doesn't have any stretch... great as long as I don't plan on sitting down anywhere."
3.0,"These are cute. I expected them to be more padded for crawling, but they are basically just leg warmers."
3.0,"This is a decently made piece of jewelry that hangs nicely. The chain and pendant were a little shorter and slightly smaller than expected, but not outrageously so. I was a bit disappointed with the pendant because the black contrast was not nearly as heavy as the advertisement suggests. The overall product felt, off, like it was leftover from a decades-old stash found at the bottom of a shipping crate, or even a different item altogether. But once you hit it with some black permanent marker in the indented areas, it adds enough contrast to make it look a little closer to their advertised pictures, though you can still tell that they likely photoshopped their product pictures. I'm not exactly happy with the necklace and pendant because I feel it is yet another deceptive product, but at least you can do something to make it look a bit better. The execution of the pendant may seem off, but the foundation/the materials themselves are as expected. It is an okay value for what you get once you add some contrast. Luckily the recipient liked it, which was its saving grace."
3.0,"Nice belt, definitely not genuine leather."
3.0,"If you have a larger chest, I’d size up a bit. I have a smaller chest and still should have gone up one. It ended up being tight there, especially under my arms, so I returned it."
3.0,Very beautiful necklace but the twisty thing on top comes loose very easily.
3.0,"I love the colors, but the sizing is not oversized as stated. Haven’t tried washing to see how it holds up."
3.0,"Got these for my husband. These are super thick, which my husband does not like so he probably will not wear them."
3.0,"Runs small , I measured myself according to the chart provided...<br /> Non stretchy fabric"
3.0,"The clips that attach to the mask's ear loops are plastic, and they don't latch or anything. I'm sure maybe the gap is for safety or ease of use, but I'd prefer it was more like a carabiner and latched securely. It can fall off easily."
3.0,It’s a beautiful design but the resin was rough in places and the color quality wasn’t as good as in the site photo.
3.0,I bought this for my sons glasses but it broke.  I didn't bother trying to get a refund due to the inexpensive price.  Ended up getting a much sturdier pair through the eye doctor.
3.0,I bought two of these I did not realize the pockets were so shallow my phone doesn't really fit in it medium sized phone. On one of them the pocket is becoming unstitched I do like the feel of it though and it's just the right weight.
3.0,"Nice glasses for the price.  Be careful of how you store them, the scratch easily."
3.0,"Color and pattern as shown. I was expecting a more cotton feel, but it was thicker and smoother feel. It was a little longer than I prefer for my height- well under the knees. Arms were little snug, but I do have chubby arms. I ordered a medium and it fit okay other than mentioned above. A large would have been too big and baggy. For reference: I’m 5’5” about 150 lb, women’s size 8-10 and bra 34D-36C."
3.0,It would be great if i was at least 20 lbs smaller.
3.0,"Too small, but the material is very good. Package sent to me shows women on the cover, I needed them in Men's size."
3.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet, but the leaves are too delicate.  I'm sure that with repeated use, the leaves and where they attach will get damaged."
3.0,"The shorts are very nice green color and good tailoring but there is something terribly wrong with the design. They look nice when you are just standing there. When you walk, they bunch up in the crotch.  My husband says it looks like I have a moving camel toe."
3.0,"It’s a beautiful dress and fits nicely. But it feels like polyester, not cotton."
3.0,misleading about the quality
3.0,"These, I think might be best for outside as they fit a little loosely and are inclined to slip down.  The ear part is lots more comfortable than elastic, being a soft knit, but they aren't adjustable.  There is no pocket for a filter, but I am not sure a filter is necessary unless one has to be indoors with it.  I like the plain black and white for looks.  These aren't my first choice, but they aren't bad.  Next time I must go into a building I will wear a mask that can be better tightened and has a pocket for a dust filter."
3.0,On the small side.
3.0,"A bit bulky, but fits juust right in a male pocket. Was convenient to have all my items in one place on a recent trip to tokyo. Only reason I picked it is that it wasn't the one swarmed with &#34;i got it for free, it's gr8 m8&#34; reviews."
3.0,Loved the butterflies. My hip measurement 43”waist 36”. These jeans aren’t high waisted what I would think would come up around your belly button. I need to use a belt to keep them up & not show my buttocks.
3.0,"The pants are a little see through. That is the hardest part of buying yoga capris, so often they are see through. I may be sending them back."
3.0,"I loved the style and pattern of the material, but unfortunately it looked cheap and I did not like the fit"
3.0,"For starters, the shoes were slightly smaller that what I had hoped for.  I ordered them 1/2 size larger and they came in about 1/2 size smaller.  After looking for a house shoe that was going to have some cushion to it without going to a fleece lining, I thought I had found it.  Well, even with putting insoles in the shoes I can feel the molding of the soles.  The uppers are comfortable and well made without any seams touching my feet.  It would be hard to recommend them because of the sole issue but to be fair my feet are very sensitive .  The general wearer might do okay with them."
3.0,"Nice looking, good fit although they seem to run about a half size small."
3.0,Torso long but sleeves very tight.  Hard to put on and instead of alaska cruise wearing just donated to good will
3.0,Very cute but the chain & ring part  that holds your keys came off the very first day. That was on the first one. The second one had poor stitching and the chain completely came off of dog. Don't bother unless you are ok with revamping the whole thing.
3.0,"Roomy shoe, I would recommend"
3.0,Very pretty but small
3.0,NICE SHIRT BUT WAY TO SHORT FOR ME
3.0,"It's beautiful, but too narrow."
3.0,Too big for my 8 year old daughter.
3.0,I love the comfort but definitely go down  a size.  I'm 5'4 125 and there is no way to wear it without looking like a tent in a small
3.0,I used these to personalize my 5.0 Ford F150 's Floor mats.<br />I cut off the chain and eyelet and they look great.
3.0,"Just received my sunglasses and was thrilled to receive them, I was disappointed to see them with some defects. It has airbubbles on the frame. If I look past that, the glasses are very pretty, stylish, BIG, You Will Love them.<br />I would have given them a 5 star unfortunately that defect does bug me."
3.0,Cheesy material
3.0,Extremely thin material. Might as well have just called it a long sleeve with a hoodie. It's not a sweatshirt. It's about the size of 12 to 18 month not a 3t.
3.0,Slightly smaller than anticipated.
3.0,These are all cute but a lot of the clasps break very fast and some came broken.
3.0,Doesn't fit like a dress. Fits like a shirt.
3.0,I'm a 34D and this LARGE top feels more like a 36 B/C. The LARGE bottoms are a tiny bit too tight (I typically wear size 11) .
3.0,Cute shirt but runs really small. I usually wear a small and ordered a M just to be safe and it's still too small. Material is a little thin but can wear a tank under.
3.0,I use this product for church but it was too small by like a couple inches
3.0,My daughter LOVED all the princess shirts. They do run about a size small. Hoping they don’t shrink after washing.
3.0,The capsule of the umbrella scratched. I tried polishing it. I am always hate with what I order but I just want you all to check the other ones before you ship to anyone/ It was a present but it look used so had to get another present. I just hate that because she loves different things. THANKS.
3.0,"I love the look of the boots, unfortunately they are too big. I should have ordered a size down. Hoping I will be able to get them exchanged."
3.0,"My wife appreciated the style of this, and the price was right, but she just couldn't get it looking good on her wrist. So, we returned it."
3.0,"They look and feel like $8 sunglasses. Not very comfortable, but not terrible either."
3.0,"the quality matches the price, but they are great for beach reading as they fit over my reading glasses! So totally worth it. If they get lost...not a big deal."
3.0,Bottom fit but top is somewhat small not for busty people.
3.0,Repeated emails from Amazon to rate an review the item make me regret the purchase. I bought the item as a gift. I can not give you 5 stars. The necklace is nice! I did not know Amazon treated their purchases like EBay.
3.0,"Just for summer fun. It was cheap and it's cheap looking, but it's summer, so some things normally not ok are ok for this season when we are more relaxed."
3.0,Beautiful boots! Fit a little bigger and wider than I expected
3.0,Runs small which was unfortunate but it was a nice product. Returned item
3.0,"Really cute, but they break easily, well at least mine did.<br />:("
3.0,"It seemed okay, kind cheap feeling though"
3.0,"Great material, very soft and we'll made quality fabric. Style wise it is too big for a petite person and runs a little large."
3.0,"I ordered this umbrella in beige, but it’s definitely not a true beige. Instead, it’s a pinkish almost fleshy tone. Not sure if I’m going to keep it."
3.0,This was a little disappointing you have to really squeeze the ball hard to pump the other ear one bubble blows both sides up not sure if little guy will be able to make both wings go up the same price high for this item to
3.0,"I am 5'7&#34;, 180 lbs,,, i bought an xxl, this jumper fit all my curves very well, the lenght is perfect, 2 1/2 inch heel and all i saw was the top of the shoe. If you have a pouch it will show, but a good shapewear will control that.<br />The back of the jumper was cut to wide, i will take it to my taylor to adjust it to fit me perfectly.<br />One last thing its minor but, the legs are a bit to bell for me at the bottom."
3.0,"It's made a little off; the fabric is beautiful. The neck is very deep, very.."
3.0,"Wish I would of gotten a medium. But, I hemmed them and I think they will work."
3.0,The temples on my sunglasses are too wide to fit. Returned. Oh well.
3.0,"The case seems to lock well, prohibiting accidental opening.  The lanyard release is to easy to unlock, so you have to be careful.  My problem with this case is that the inner dimension is only 1/2"" (at most) at the widest area, which is too small to put a key fob or car alarm remote.  Even putting the key towards the bottom, the cover will not close.  The all around contour does not lend itself to holding more than a couple of credit cards and a few bills."
3.0,"Looked great out of the box. A strong leather smell accompanied. Put them on, fit OK, but very stiff. Wore them about, and decided to use leather oil to soften them up. Leather color darkened a few shades, but may lighten up over time. Seems to work, and will need a lot of breaking in to get to the ""old favorite"" comfortable rough-out boot i was looking for."
3.0,Purchased to empty out a freezer we do it weekly at my job<br />It doesn’t keep your finger tips very warm and rip pretty easily
3.0,Way TOO short!!!
3.0,"While a very nice tote, I wanted something at least 12&#34; in length.  While the on-line said it was this long, the base is actually only 10&#34; and so I returned it."
3.0,Love the look of these earrings but the wire part did not stay out in the rattan part. Wound up having to superglue the wire in just so that I could wear them the first time. After the superglue they seem to be holding up just fine.
3.0,"Cheap quality, very pretty, just touch them lightly, no tugging. They might break"
3.0,I like the fit and material but am disappointed with the sewing. The stripes around the waist were very mismatched.
3.0,Waistband too loose. Ankles too tight. Decent material.
3.0,It’s is soft and comfortable. Was not tight on my stomach area like i like it to be. I won’t buy it again.
3.0,Runs a little small..but cute!
3.0,This was perfect for our costume idea! Fit nicely and was stretchy and comfortable.  Only issue is the back zipper when you have to pee! Haha
3.0,Nice but a little large and not in normal Gucci case
3.0,"Sending this back.  It was huge.  I realize that sleep wear is worn loose...and have always thought, &#34;the bigger the better&#34; when it come to something that you're going to sleep in, but this was beyond that."
3.0,"These are a lot baggier and bigger than I envisioned. I don’t mind for wearing around the house in the summer, but I wouldn’t wear them out. Maybe size down, although the waist was sized okay. It’s elastic so there is some give."
3.0,"Not quite as comfortable as Birkenstock sandals, with more break-in than I'd like, but overall a good shoe."
3.0,"It was missing a button but other than that is was ok, definitely worn before."
3.0,"I ordered the large size for my 2 almost 3 year old and it was extremely small. He is tall but not gigantic. I had to alter it to fit, so much that I could have made one from scratch and it might have been easier. Other than the very off size the costume was warm and super adorable."
3.0,"Very cute shirt, a little tight the shirt runs a little small."
3.0,Best thing it works. Bad thing someone has to assist you in placing it on. It’s near impossible to put this on by yourself.
3.0,I liked this and would have kept it but it runs small.
3.0,They are getting three stars only for style. NOT quality. As far as style is concerned these boots look super cute. They are not build for long walks. You can feel the heel when walking. The lining inside is super thin. Go up half a size.
3.0,"These are great, in theory...<br />But they are about two inches too short.<br />I am 5 foot 11, and sometimes, when I bend over, the snaps will come loose.<br />I have the elastic bands maxed out at the longest length, but there's often no way for the snaps to stay on."
3.0,Not as pictured look a lot cheaper
3.0,"They weren't long enough & I'm short (5'3""). But they were baggy in the stomach which wasn't flattering."
3.0,Colors look faded and the witness is not the same .
3.0,Okay for the price. NOT polarized. Case says Dasiy.<br />Would recommend if you don't care about them being polarized.
3.0,"They were perfect the first time I wore them, I washed them once and they completely unravelled. Oh well... It was a Halloween costume, so not a big deal, but wish I could have worn them again if I wanted to."
3.0,A little small for my wrist.  They do make a good wallet keeper though.  Makes it harder to fall out of your pocket.
3.0,"It's very, very cute, but it came &#34;undone&#34; pretty quickly.  It unraveled."
3.0,"You get what you pay for. The band is made of silicon material that is less dense than the real apple band. It doesn’t hold the weight of the watch as well, causing the watch to constantly move off center from your wrist. The watch will constantly slide to the side of your arm unless you wear it very tightly. The real Apple band keeps the watch in place without your having to wear it tightly.<br /><br />It works, but not enough for me to enjoy wearing my watch. My watch turned into a nuisance with this band attached."
3.0,"The glasses are really nice, they were just way too big for my face! I had to return them, but I loved the frames and they were comfortable!"
3.0,I love the size of these bags but the photo does not accurately depict the handles of the bag. They are actually nylon. They are not made from the same canvas as the bag. Disappointed 😞 but no time to find the handles I wanted.
3.0,These look great and they fit over my glasses but the frame is translucent which defeats the purpose of sun protection. Don't choose these if you are worried about UV exposure to your eyes through the clear frame.
3.0,Much shorter than I expected. But very soft and warm.
3.0,It's cute. Nothing special. But will serve its purpose
3.0,"Cute style and nice metallic colors. Disappointed this bag is smaller than described in the ad.  Ad states 10.8""x9.5""x3.1. It is actually 9""X7"". I have other Sak purses and the quality on this purse is not quite as good. Also, sadly the price today is $15.00 less than I paid.  Bottom line though, keeping it and will remove a few items that won't fit."
3.0,Very cute but the knot is very loose and it ends up hanging way too low all the time.
3.0,The sleeves are a little short but the sweater itself fit as expected
3.0,it really doesn't give you that push up bra look. Nothing like a VS bra
3.0,"Was broken when I received. Thankfully I can fix it, but you never expect the product you ordered to be fixed. Kind of disappointed."
3.0,It’s really bulky. Not very feminine.  The picture is deceiving.
3.0,"Cute, but runs very very small."
3.0,"I got my order on February 24th 2021, I socks were undamaged and appeared to be just what I ordered. I opened on package and noticed they appeared to be small in size more like kids size. The label said adult XL I compared them to the XL socks I got from the doctors office. The new socks were about an inch narrower than the ones I got from the doctor. I would advise to order a size larger than what you think you need. The quality with the item purchase is very good just run small."
3.0,These are everything people say they are.  Unfortunately with no heel enclosure my stride is affected as I am being careful not to let them fall off.  This is punishing my lower back.  If they made a real slipper with all the design characteristics of this mule they would really have something.
3.0,"I purchased these pants because in the description it stated work pants. To me they are more of a legging and I would not wear them to work. They are stretchy, but also tight fitting. Around the waist, it fits fine, just not for work."
3.0,The ring itself is quite good. The sizes run kind of small. Be aware that this rings rattles a lot.
3.0,Too large from the arms. Material was not that great. Got some complements. But wish it was more fitted from the arms.
3.0,They had a disagreeable swell to the fabric as well as being too small!
3.0,I was happy they fit perfect. The material is a bit too thin
3.0,"Sleeves very puffy, cheap fabric and consequently the fabrics just didn't lay well"
3.0,"I love these leggings. I am 5'5"" 135 lbs and got a size small. They fit perfect and are super comfortable, however, like most leggings, when I bend over, they are see-through."
3.0,"I am generally a big fan of seiko dive watches.  In the past, I've heavily used an automatic and kinetic without issue for many years.  For some reason on this one the crystal shattered without me noticing and the colored ring on the crown fell off in less than a year.  I think paying more for a Japanese model is not worth it, especially if there is no warranty.  I'll chalk it up to bad luck on this one."
3.0,"This bracelet is super cute.  The only problem is . . . it is extremely difficult to put on, even by a person NOT wearing the bracelet.  I would wear it more often, but I can't put it on."
3.0,"It's good quality for cheep price<br />I bought this eyeglass for new daily style, and my sister took the other one to replace the lenses."
3.0,Its nice i ordered small and it was a little lose on me i use medium or small so got small since it's a tshirt am 5'.0 and weight 130pounds and it fits just a bit lose so it's hard to really get size..other than that it's good.
3.0,"My Grandson Loves this jacket, however; for my money I would have preferred it to be a bit heavier.  I also feel that the size didn't accurately reflect what I was looking for, It is a little small, in my opinion."
3.0,I have another Grace Karin dress in a similar cut and love it. I feel sexy in it. This one seems to ride up my leg/thigh and bunch up around the stomach. Wasn't a fan and returned it.
3.0,To small even though the correct size was ordered.
3.0,"I have never left a bad review..... I love how they look and my boyfriend loves these. I got the dark red ones. Instead of gold like it looks in the picture, it's actually cut outs. So all the not red color is your skin. Not a problem for me, I know it makes my sister uncomfortable. I've had them for about two weeks and all the little holes are now starting to run. It looks like runs in tights. Not sure why. But it disappoints me. I wish I didn't have to be so cautious with wearing them. I've worn them twice and feel like I can't because of the runs."
3.0,Doesn’t quite look like image. Runs small
3.0,"I ordered a size 10 in the green, it is stretchy but the material was a little too thin for my taste.  It accentuated my belly area.  If it had more structure it would have been better. the length was great and the style of the open back was very pretty.  it was just an odd fit but the picture is so pretty! thank goodness for amazon prime because this had to be returned."
3.0,would have liked a bigger size.
3.0,I have long arms and the sleeves just aren’t that long. They hit right at my wrists. But it was soft and heavy which I wanted. I had to return since the sleeves will just get shorter with washes.
3.0,It's a very attractive purse. I've never been a fan of hard billfolds but this one is sturdy and easy to use. The purse is heavy. I think it is made very well and sturdy but it does make it heavy....even before you put your gun in it. Gun is easy to get to.
3.0,Not as pretty in person as in the picture.
3.0,Didn't realize this was shorter in the front than the back. I'll check return policy next time
3.0,feet swollen so right one is a little small
3.0,This shirt is super soft but it looks and feels frumpy. I’m still going to wear it though because it’s so soft.
3.0,"It fit OK, but the white is really see-through. Returned."
3.0,"Buckle is a little bulkier than I like, but otherwise, it's a nice belt."
3.0,ummm I know what size I wear it didn't fit at all the fit was SO that even the one I got from WISH for half the price fit I would have given them one star but I made know effort to reach out to them I'm sure they would have given me a refund
3.0,I can't stand how it feels on. But that's my own issue
3.0,Very cute BUT Does NOT have adjustable length as advertised - it is 18”.
3.0,"They could be a good sock for the price, but as typical with this style, they come off the heal and scrunch up under your foot as you walk..."
3.0,Medium runs slightly small. Very cute pattern. Polyester material.
3.0,"😂😂😂 this did not fit at all. If you are plus size honey run this one is not for us. I ripped seams trying to put it on<br />.<br /><br />I’m sure it’s good quality, doesn’t run true to size, not size inclusive, too many pieces that were loose upon arrival so I lost a few bows without realizing it."
3.0,Decent hat but it came with a big crease in it
3.0,"Thick, warm and heavy coat. I was looking for a warm and easy to move my arms in rain resistant coat. From what I had read this was the coat for me. Sad to say that's a NO. This coat soaks up water like a sponge and becomes incredibly heavy. If it wasn't for that I would give 4 stars. Size reference 5'6"" 175lbs bout XL fits loosely comfortable."
3.0,Low rez print of the lens but other then that its pretty nice
3.0,Fit was decent (teeny bit snug) but the material was on the thin side. I normally wear a size 14.
3.0,I have an average size wrist and this is too tight to wear comfortably. Disappointed...
3.0,It is a good looking item. However I would not advise using this for running for two reasons:<br />1) It is too thick for heavy breathing<br />2) It will fall off as it is not elastic enough. There are other ones that look the same but with a higher elastane content. Go for those.
3.0,"Smaller then I expected, my earlobe was too fat.😂"
3.0,"These aren't the highest quality fabric, but you do get what you pay for. It's the kind of material that will pull and fray a bit if it comes into contact with the wrong side of velcro or anything sharp. The white color isn't so transparent that your...sensitive chest parts...will be visible through it — for me, at least. It's super lightweight."
3.0,"Nice scarf, but very thin. You have to be careful around the ends because it can start unraveling"
3.0,I have a large hand and it barely fits over my hands.  It works ok but I wish it was a bit larger.  Should be fine for smaller hands.
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, its super comfy. However the quality just isnt there. The belt thing came off 2 minutes after I put it on, and there were loose threads literally everywhere. The slit came up a little higher than I wanted so I ended up having to add 2 more buttons, but they sent extras so that worked out good.<br /><br />Im 5'4"" and 140 lbs and I bought a small, it fits really well everywhere except at the shoulders and the length. I have broad shoulders anyway, but I couldnt lift my arms above my head with this. Its also like really really long. If I were to get it hemmed they'd have to do up at least 3 inches in order for it to hit my ankle<br /><br />I dont like the little elastic loops they use instead of button holes. They will probably come right off if I tugged on them, and it makes buttoning the dress super obnoxious.<br /><br />All in all, Id buy it again for like 12 bucks, but not 30."
3.0,Gorgeous! Huge and very pretty on-would definitely buy again. Updating to say these break very quickly. The Pearl comes off. I’ve purchased several pairs and it keeps happening:(
3.0,Runs small and stiff material
3.0,Very thin.  Would be good to wear over a bathing suit.
3.0,Works good but wish it was sturdier and the Velcro was not so rough.
3.0,"Loved the dress, but it did not fit correctly.  I am short waisted and that creates a problem.  Wanted to keep it but could not figure out how to adjust."
3.0,"The wig itself is good quality, but this does not include any off the accessories listed in the description. The hair beads, headband horns, and tail were not included.<br />Disappointed by the false advertisement of the listing description."
3.0,Disappointing that they didn't have pockets as advertised.
3.0,"I loved this dress and got a lot of compliments on it, however, the first time I washed it, one of the buttons fell right off."
3.0,"The watch is small and very light. The black steel peels off after a month. I am currently trying to peel all the black, to make it look a little more presentable."
3.0,"Quality was not great, several of the flowers fell out before use and would need to be hot glued back in. But licensed and worked"
3.0,"I had to cut the straps that goes around the  ankle because it was waaaayyyyyy too big and loose. Apart from that, love the colors of the sandals."
3.0,It’s cute but very stiff material.  It comfortable
3.0,"I want to thank you to the company .  the customer service  is really good  . The dress is beautiful , the quality it’s good and again thank you for . and the size is perfect ."
3.0,The top of the dress is extremely stretchy. The dress fits much larger than I had expected.
3.0,"When you wear an XL hat, this one is too small.  The look is fine, the paint on straw makes it very stiff."
3.0,I like these earrings a lot. Sizes range from dime to smaller than a quarter. They snap clasp to avoid a sharp point on the back. Earrings were a good fit for typically pierced ears but too small to wear higher up on the thicker part of the ear.
3.0,It was not empire at all and was much shorter in length.  Gave it to a friend who is shorter than I.
3.0,Cute Piece for a gift!!
3.0,"If you're expecting this dress to fit you because it's stretchy, that would be fine except the lace part has no flexibility whatsoever. Hence, the dress was too tight on me in the arms. However, I'm going to try to modify it so that the sleeves are expanded to fit properly. Otherwise, the dress is fine!"
3.0,"Seemed like a nice belt if it would have fit. I bought the 34&#34;-36&#34; for my hubby who wears a 34&#34;-36&#34; in jeans, and it was WAY too small (like the very end of the belt barely touched the buckle. So I returned it and went up two sizes, and that one was WAY too big. We gave up."
3.0,Like the bra but not for big busted women<br />It is a good bra
3.0,"Good look, steel toe a little uncomfortable"
3.0,Words faded as soon as I touched it. :(
3.0,"Beautiful pattern..But, this dress is not made for curvy women. This was too small and way too short. Cheap material. See thru."
3.0,I forgot to get on size larger due to it is a tight fit
3.0,Found it be very small watch for my wrist.  Other than that it has all the essential features you need.
3.0,I ordered up a few sizes based on reviews and I'm glad I did it fits well! I usually wear an XL or XXL but I ordered a 4xl and it fits well.
3.0,"I’m usually a medium but given that it was a compression fit with a suggestion to order a size larger if in between sizes I ordered large.  When it arrived, I was sent XXL which is a lot larger than I wanted.  The product itself is fine just make sure you get the correct size."
3.0,I wear a 6.5 gloves. These are nicely made except the fingers are much too long for a small hand. I'll keep them as a spare in my glove compartment.
3.0,Too narrow on the bust area - it didn't fit (I am a 38 D)
3.0,"The boat neck is kind of huge. Have a hard time covering bra straps. The decorative/strange seams on the front hit me on top of my breasts, so it looks a little weird.  The sleeves are also somewhat tight, like they sized up the rest of the dress but not the sleeves. I don't have unusually large arms (for this size range) so I'm not sure why they're like that.  It is a very nice length (I'm 5'6&#34; and it hits just above the knee, so it's a long tunic with jeans or leggings, or a very short summery dress) and it's made of a medium-weight fabric with a nice drape and swing, it's not clingy, it's comfortable and breathable. I like the color (denim-ish blue) and it has been washed and dried several times now and is wearing very nicely."
3.0,"Serengetis are always good lenses, but this style fits very close to the face.<br />I have long eyelashes that actually touch the lens....a bit annoying"
3.0,These ones are not as good as my old Lots....not feeling very good when I wear them...wouldn't buy again
3.0,arrived bent during shipment on 2 posts of earrings straightened it out carefully
3.0,"The jeans are okay they are a bit small the material is a bit stiff I did let them soak in the rinse cycle to soften them up Over all they are just okay However they did come on time and they were well packaged no complaints there,"
3.0,"Good while they lasted, but holes developed in three months with light wear (less than once a week). Not very sturdy. Too expensive for the short lifespan."
3.0,The Monarch Butterfly earrings were cut nice on wood but weere colored yellow & no orange on it. Very Disappointed as it was a gift.
3.0,Not what I expected... Won't stay up and they are extremely hot even when wet.
3.0,I didn’t like the fit at all. They were too tight in some areas and too loose in others.
3.0,"After having these and putting them to good use. Had the handle tear off one, then the zipper broke off of another."
3.0,It looks hideous like a secretary from 1970s. If that's what you want it is great. Made my breathing harder on my nose.
3.0,I only got 9 and not 10!
3.0,"The top was cute.  I usually wear either a large or XL in tops.  I ordered the XL in this one since it's clingy material.  However, it fit more like it was a medium.  Had to send it back"
3.0,Ok nice design but runs very small. I will need to figure out how and what I will wear it with and probably need to loose 10 lbs
3.0,"The phrase you get what you pay for certainly does not apply here.  I have purchased many prayer beads, mostly at lesser cost, that are considerable better quality than this one.  Be cautious, it is small and feels cheap to include the brass (?)"
3.0,"I'm 5'0, and the length of the pant is too long. I have about three or three and a half inches of the size that's just dangling.  I didn't want to have to hem it or have it altered considering the material seems tricky to work with."
3.0,Nice love it!
3.0,"First off, it was hard to see the actual coloring from the pic, but the shirt I received had gray bands around the armpit areas, which I do not like. Second, while the picture looks fitted, the actual shirt is very &#34;barrel-shaped&#34;, so for my midsection, it is far too bulky. I would have to get at least a size smaller, but then the sleeves would be too short.<br /><br />It's hard to buy cloths and shoes, sight unseen. Overall, it's a nice-looking shirt, but I will likely not wear it due to the sizing. And if I were to sweat, I imagine it would show immediately with the grey material."
3.0,"Posts were not attached to stud straight, poor workmanship"
3.0,Really cute shirt with pretty and bright colors.  But it is very thin material.....pretty much see-thru.  Just to let y'all know.  Great for summer.  The sizing also seems to run small.
3.0,"A decent, soft shirt that has gotten me repeated compliments. I like to roll up the sleeves, but it's not easy to get them to stay up."
3.0,"I love the look of the belt.  I bought it, mainly, to wear with my golf outfits.  It looks great on, however, I cannot keep the belt from coming loose.  As I move the ratchet works loose and comes undone.  I had already cut it down so did not try to return it."
3.0,Not this one! I paid 29.99 2 weeks ago for it now they are $72.00!! I want to return it for a L but the price jump is to much for a thin zip hoodie.
3.0,"Bought these for my extra large hubby but we had to return the product. They arrived fine & he liked the fabric + pockets. The problem was the thick heavy waist band, it rolled down or folded over every time he say down.  If that wasn't a problem, he would've liked them better."
3.0,"3 metals, Copper, Brass and Silver are nicely twisted making it unique. I gave 3 stars because the end joints are not soldered properly, most likely a rush job. Used a dremel sander and all it done."
3.0,"made me look to fat, everything shows"
3.0,"1. It's very cute, once you figure out how to put it on and get is adjsted.<br />2. Very cheap quality<br /><br />Shipping was very quick, and even though its kinda cheap it's decent enough to wear in public and I would purchase from the seller again"
3.0,The bands are nice but were too large. So if you are a little person they will not be helpful. I had to give mine away.
3.0,"I was so looking forward to getting this shirt and when it arrived was so disappointed. The shirt is very pretty, size seems fine, but instead of saying Mama, like pictured, it says Mamaw. I'm not a grandma yet so it's being returned :("
3.0,"Not what I thought they were, Returning."
3.0,I like it. Thanks
3.0,Very thin and see through but my son says it's comfortable
3.0,Belt loops aren't at the waist as they should be.
3.0,Definitely would recommend giving it a good washing.<br />Came with a smell and was weirdly oily when it arrived.<br /><br />Very good mask besides that.
3.0,"I loved the quality, but I was disappointed with the size of the hat. Fits more like a toddler sized hat.  Would not recommend for teenagers."
3.0,Very nice product just to big for my face.
3.0,"Had to return because it didn’t fit, runs small"
3.0,Ride up more than I would like
3.0,Love the look and quality. Only downside is the clasp falls to the front of your neck constantly so all day you are placing it to the back of your neck. It's obnoxious cuz it's a great size and really cute.
3.0,"This dress looks soo cute and sexy but sadly the quality is not good at all. As my husband was zipping up the dress for me, the zipper started to come apart and was stuck in the middle! This made no sense since I had plenty of room within the dress. Sadly due to this incident, I didn't want to risk exchanging it and then this happening while I was out at an event or something. Still very cute though!"
3.0,"So yes they are adorable but they aren't knee socks like I was hoping, they are full hose that go all the way up to the waist."
3.0,"The shipping was amazingly fast and the quality of the tie is fantastic. However, it was not was I was expecting as it only somewhat resembles the photo. The color is different-- not olive green, more of a dark sage (gray/green) and there aren't visible pinstripes. It is still a beautiful tie, but we made this purchase for our park wedding and it's too close in color to my fiance's gray wool suit. We both loved the color of the tie in the photo, too bad."
3.0,"Verrrry thin fabric. See-through. Xtra Long straps. May wear this once, imagine it will shred pretty soon due to poor quality of fabric. Probably best use as dust rag."
3.0,I had similar facemask before but its not like the ones before. These are light ok but not as light as ones I've used before. Have an odd smell after opening so I think ill try washing it and then wear it. Over all the name buttery soft doesn't go with the product quality.
3.0,"It was pretty! Fits nice. I wish they had it in different colors, maybe even plain black. Too many dots on the dress."
3.0,"Wayyyyy too small. Arms were tight, could barely move"
3.0,"Nice handbag - soft, faux-leather and well made. However, it SMELLED AWFUL for days - used lots and lots of Febreeze and aired it out for probably a week before I could even use it."
3.0,Been buying sanuk in this size for years. Sadly this style was much smaller when I compared them with my old ones in same size. The camo blanket liner top is a little stiff but seems made ok.<br />Disappointing for this brand.
3.0,"It's a fun converstaion piece, but the battery only lasted a month, and I threw the watch in the trash."
3.0,Cute dress but waaaaay too tight.
3.0,They don’t hook into the sense properly and fall off.
3.0,"i'm a medium, ordered XL and it was STILL too small."
3.0,"Fit is OK, but material is too scratchy for my liking.  I would be thinking about how uncomfortable I was all night.  5’7” 135, small was correct sizing."
3.0,Super cute but too small. I gave them to my bestie. She loves them.
3.0,"EDIT: Original Review Below<br />Update: I ordered another pair of size 1 Little Kid and they are still the wrong size, still the exact same length/size as my other son's size 3 Little Kid. How can a size 1 Little Kid be the exact same length as a size 3 Little Kid??!!<br /><br />I bought two pairs of these shoes last year, one in a size 13 Little Kid and one in a size 3 Little Kid. My youngest son has outgrown the 13 Little Kid so I recently ordered a size 1 Little Kid. When they arrived, the label claims they are size 1 Little Kid but they are way too big...in fact, they are they exact same size/length as my older son's size 3 Little Kid. I'm reordering in hopes of getting the correct size this time because they really are good shoes and they worked extremely well for both boys last summer. Hopefully this time we'll receive a ""true"" size 1 Little Kid and my faith will be restored!"
3.0,"They were a little tight, even the large was snug on the finger (ring size 5 1/2)"
3.0,"It's ok, hoopless so I didn't get the price but I needed it....if you can order far enough in advance there are others exactly the same but $5 or more cheaper. Wouldn't purchase again for the price they charged for a children's petticoat. I purchased nice quality women's Petticoats for same price and three times the material"
3.0,The drawstrings are too short and the shorts I bought were supposed to be 2x and they were a lot smaller besides that they are holding up wash after wash.
3.0,The colors were not as bright as I thought they would be.  Part of the  chain had become loose.
3.0,"I was excited to receive this shirt because it’s exactly what I was looking for but it’s cut very odd. It’s short and really wide with no distinct separation between the sleeves and body of the shirt, so if you hold your arms out it looks like bat wings. Per the size chart I ordered a small, which is my usual size. Customer service was great about my return though!! I’m sad it wasn’t a fit."
3.0,Wish it would’ve fit.
3.0,The material is supper cheep and see though in the sunlight.  I gave it 3 stars though because it looks exactly like the picture and I ended up wearing it to a dark bar were no one could see though it.
3.0,"I bought this dress using their sizing. I was so excited when my dress finally arrived it was tight but if I had bought up a size it would fall off and the material is a On the cheaper side and sheer. Get what you pay for.  I am keeping the dress just will wear spanx underneath, with the realization that what might seem like a great deal in the end really isn't."
3.0,"liked shoe, but was too small"
3.0,Really tight and my legs are tiny
3.0,"Item as described. The glass was a little bit damaged and one fake diamond; was missing, but for the price I think it's fine. I only bought it to use at work ; I can't wear a watch but I can have one in my pocket, and I didn't want to lose or break my expensive one. This one works and it's discreet and nice, so for me it's perfect !"
3.0,"The top and middle weren't what i was expecting, i returned it and got refund."
3.0,Fast shipping. Nice quality but too big and not what I wanted. Not as pictured.
3.0,Gift for girl friend
3.0,I love this dress. It fit pretty well. However it was a tad bit to large. I also wished it was more taking in at the waist around. But overall really pretty dress.
3.0,"I plan to use this bag when I travel.  It has pocket and many places to place items at handy access.  You could carry a laptop In this purse and still have room for an overnight sleepover for your personal items.  I would recommend this bag very highly.It is a very big purse.  One who works are has to carry a lot of items for work or travel it would be perfect.  The leather is soft, but the bag its self is heavy so with items in it makes for a heavy purse"
3.0,Ended up getting it two days after the first estimated  delivery  date but other then that I was very happy with the way it look
3.0,It is a nice and good tag
3.0,This was purchased because of it’s size which is just right.  The color is not my favorite but I knew that before purchasing.  I have not used sufficiently to comment further about it.
3.0,"So when I ordered this bracelet, I was fully expecting normal sized beads. These beads are huge and look awkward on the wrist. It is not functional, in the slighted. The color is great, but thats about where it stops for me. I would be happier with this item if the beads were much smaller"
3.0,its a beautiful product but the clasp is flimsy and the chain looks like its made for a child. its way too thin and easily breakable. i had already returned it the same day i got it still waiting on my refund to come through.
3.0,Colors doesn't have anything to do with the picture I had chosen. And the second problem is that measure doesn't fit well if I try to use it as bracelet.
3.0,"I loved it when i first got it, but the leather cord is poor quality. Its already wearing out and i only had it for less than a month. disappointing..."
3.0,They were on the short side.  I returned them.
3.0,Ordered this just to compare to another sneaker cleaner. I think I’ll just stick to the other brand. Only thing I like about this product is the packaging.
3.0,"This is such a beautiful necklace and I love it!! However it did come broken , but hey you can fix that! It is really beautiful and it makes a great gift for someone!"
3.0,"This sweater fits as expected. However the material feels a bit strange. Its soft but also kinda silky, not what you would expect from the photos. I kept it but mostly will just lounge around in the house with it."
3.0,Clasp is hard to use
3.0,Wear my rings all the time
3.0,The cups on the top were sewn to the string.
3.0,Poor workmanship on the prayer shawl. I purchased from another seller before and it was excellent.  This one looked the same on the site but I was deceived. The thing that matters though is the effectiveness of the Word of God.
3.0,Does not come with the gift packing shown<br />I bought this as a gift thinking it included the packaging shown in the photo but ended up returning it because it just came in a plastic bag with none of the gift wrap items shown. Ended up getting a way nicer and even engraved leather lanyard with nice  packaging for even cheaper on another website. The material here is decent but it’s not worth $30 and the hook park felt kind of cheap.
3.0,"Very nice lights, but lights  only lasted two weeks.."
3.0,"The necklace is made of ribbon going through the little gold pieces. I didn't notice it when I ordered it. It is still a fun necklace, but it is not super high quality materials. It is not very flexible either and feels a little heavy."
3.0,Writing is a little small but it's a cute keychain.  Gave as a gift
3.0,"Not bad, runs small as im a large and this did not fit me, the top or bottom, if you have a bigger bust it wont fit you the best on top either, but a very cute set i wish they had an extra large"
3.0,"The product is a lot smaller than it looked and advertised online. Kind of hard to see eyes on the charm, making it hard to know what it is."
3.0,Love skidders has them before my only problem is that these fell apart within a week.
3.0,"Ok product. Extremely large, so I had to cut literally 18&#34; off. I'm a 30/32&#34; waist."
3.0,Coat looks great! Nice bargin! Too bad it doesn't fit. Purchased xl. I'm 5'4 and 180 pounds. The coat fit more like a medium. Not too snug or tight just the arms are way too short. So for that reason I will be returning. Such a bummer because I actually like the coat. Go up a size or two ladies!
3.0,Order a bigger size. It is a bit snug but the cups are way too small for us big girls! It is super cute though.
3.0,Runs small buy a size up
3.0,Ordered my usual size and it was still big. May need to order a size down.
3.0,"The size was as per manufactures suggested. The problem is with the under part of the swim dress, it doesn't have full coverage in the front, if the skirt  part of it flew up,  you would be giving someone a peep show. Therefore I returned it."
3.0,Bought for my 11 year old-couldn’t find any black pants in stores so was recommended to buy these.  They are not her go to pants-she is picky about how things fit.  They are a little too firm fitting for her.  1 of them had a hole along the seam when arrived.  She would only wear them for short periods.
3.0,Definitely not quite the same as the picture. Doesn't have the textured look and the sleeves are much lighter...The previous reviews had me expecting less than perfection and it will still work for Christmas morning :) I did order one size up and it fits well so I would recommend doing the same
3.0,"They’re warm and a solid knit, but they definitely require a garter belt. They do not stay up when you’re walking."
3.0,Revealing at the back. Can't wear undies. Plain at the front
3.0,Did its job. Fail apart after a month or so.
3.0,"Great, but not capris!!"
3.0,It wasn't as thick as i expected. And it would be nice with pockets.
3.0,"I was so excited about these. I appreciated how much I was getting for the price. Unfortunately, when I opened them, about half of the earrings chains were unlinked and I had to use pliers to put them back together. Considering they were inside 3 bags and in a padded envelope, I can only assume that they were broken before they were packaged for shipping. I could still put most of them back together which is the reason I didn’t rate it lower but disappointed in the lack of care during preparation."
3.0,"Color changed, silver tarnished, charm fell off"
3.0,"This is huge on my neck. Doesn’t fit like a choker. I’m probably gonna return it. :/ Everything else is fine, quality is a little low."
3.0,"Cute, but runs very small. I am 5’4” and 140 lbs. I normally wear a small or x-small. This was teeny tiny, I couldn’t even get it close to buttoning. It also has no stretch at all. Had to return. I’d say go 2 sizes up if you want to purchase."
3.0,"I've bought 4 pairs of these glasses because they are good at blocking sunlight from the sides as well as the front.  However, they break much easier than any other glasses I've own - always at the hinge.  Since they are so cheap, I will likely buy them as my backup-car glasses, but they aren't durable enough to be in my purse and used for longer than a few months."
3.0,"I loved this swimsuit! BUT as the reviews mentioned, this is NOT for big breasted women. I got the XL and you'd have to be a 36D or smaller to fit the top half of this without your boobs spilling out of the top or bottom.<br /><br />Post-partum I'm about a 14-16, which is usually about a XXL, yet the bottom half of this XL swimsuit fit beautifullly! I already filed for a return due to the upper half, but I'm seriously considered just tailoring it and keeping the bottom half bc it's seriously flattering enough to be worth it.<br /><br />The center straps also look great, but I guess I have a short torso bc they're a bit loose. Still looks good, just not how I want it to look.<br /><br />Lastly, a lot of other reviews are disappointed with the quality.. obviously, you shouldn't expect Billabong or H&M quality. Even Victoria Secret is hit or miss with quality. Expect the better end of Made in China quality. With my expectations in the right place, I find the quality to be satisfactory. It doesn't look like it would last a beach volleyball tournament, but it should last a whole summer's worth of poolside lounging.<br /><br />Overall, I do love this swimsuit. It's more intriguing than your average swimwear, but not too slutty looking since it has ample bottom coverage. I just wish the top half fit better, but I know that's asking a lot for a 38E. So even though I either have to return it or alter it, the product definitely deserves 3 or more stars!"
3.0,"Cute, comfortable, but she'd like crazy.  My house is full of little black fluff balls that look like I've got a spider invasion!  With this level of shedding, I don't anticipate them lasting too long.  Can't complain too much because the cost was so low."
3.0,I was so excited to receive this bag today! I do love it and it was what I expected ...until I went to put my keys in the front zipper pocket. With great disappointment I discovered the pocket bottom had been pulled up on one side and attached to the inside of the handle attachment. There is no way to use the pocket. If i can return it I<br /> possible will order it again.
3.0,Very pretty but very small
3.0,From first impressions the strap is of excellent quality but after a few days of use and opening and closing of the strap buckle the color started to peel off and wear away.  This is very disappointing
3.0,Inconsistent sizes and cut of fabric between the 3 recieved. Low quality.
3.0,Am 36d  & 145lbs and ordered an xl. Though I ordered xl after putting it on I realize I could have just gotten a large. But I dont like my clothes sticking on me so at least with this I have reasonable space.
3.0,a bit too narrow for being a M/W shoe.
3.0,"This bathing suit looks so cute but I bought slightly larger than normal and couldn't even get it over my thighs. I am 5'7&quot; and 125lbs so I bought a medium. It has no stretch to the fabric so I didn't even bother trying to get it on all the way. The material is very sturdy and it looks like it would fit great, be supportive and last a while but the fit runs way smaller than expected."
3.0,They slouch down too much.
3.0,"I chose to give this jewelry stand three stars because while it holds a lot of my jewelry, it is not well made and came broken in the box."
3.0,"I have never ordered a dress online and figured, I would do it. I saw this dress and thought it was really pretty, however it does not look like the picture, especially the bow in the front. I thought that the bow/ribbon was attached to the dress, I didn’t think it was just a “belt” that you have to tie into a bow. In the picture the bow looks so nice and when you tie it, it look nothing like the picture. The dress fit big on me, but I have a small frame so I expected that. The material was nice, just didn’t like anything less about it. It looked frumpy. I am sending it back!"
3.0,"Returning this beautiful dress because it’s very see through, it’s so see through so that my tattoos are visible through the fabric. Get in another color. Also I ordered XS and fitted somewhat loose on waist area."
3.0,Okay Item
3.0,These are sleek yoga pants.  The sizing seems a size smaller to me.
3.0,"I took a chance since it was only $10.  I'd say worth it for that price. It definitely runs small, so I ordered a large.  Usually wear a Med.  It definitely has the cheap silky polyester feel to it, but again, for $10, I was not expecting more. I'm keeping it and will wear it.  I love the bright colors and the stripes!"
3.0,Cute design but WAY small.
3.0,"The hat looked and felt as though it were poorly made.  However, it keeps the sun off.  Check the size of the brim to be sure it will give you whatever coverage you want."
3.0,They are not adjustable and are too small for my 5 year old.
3.0,Not as denim as it looks
3.0,"IT LOOKS A LITTLE OLD FASHION IN PERSON.  THE COLOR IS TOO DARK, DOESN'T LOOK RED, MORE LIKE RUST OR BURGUNDY"
3.0,Love the track suit. Fits perfectly but it came with a definite order of cigars smoke! Yuck!
3.0,Ordered these in XS. Not for short girls unless you plan on hemming them. These were super long but I loved the waist band on them bc I felt like it kept everything in. Another peeve was when I sat down I had all this extra material protruding bc of the pockets sticking out. I took pics so you guys can see that its really noticeable and unattractive when you're sitting in these. More so in person than in these pics but I tried lol  I returned them the same day. My quest for the perfect petite black pants continues. 5 foot 2 118 lbs
3.0,"They are Beautiful, but my pearls were too big for the 2 I really wanted to use.  But I couldn't fit my chains in all the holes.  Threading the chains through the holes is almost impossible, and will require some bending, so I'm not sure why I could get some chains through and some not? Why aren't they the same sizes?"
3.0,Esperaba algo mas. La talla corre un poco grande y mas si eres pettie. No esta mal. Si te abriga contra el friito pq es medio caluroso q es perfecto para areas con aire acondicionado
3.0,I don’t believe there is more traction with this style of uggs compared to the regular uggs so I would not recommend the essential because the added traction doesn’t work and is an eye sore
3.0,Skirt quality was good. Had a bit of a chemical smell. The button was loose but didn't come off. And the Medium was waaaay too small. It maybe would have fitted my waist but could not get over my thighs to find out. Definitely needed a larger size. For anyone else trying to figure out sizing; my thighs are 33 inches and my hips are 35 inches.
3.0,"Ordered accordingly to size chart and dress still to big, had to have it altered."
3.0,Too small for anything besides your computer.
3.0,Super cute sweater. Returned it too short.
3.0,"The buckles are almost impossible for adult or child hands.  They run about a size small and they smell worse than any other jelly, plastic, rubber, or foam shoe I have ever experienced. They smell worse than my best friends shoes in high school and he wore vans without socks to skateboard in Texas in the summertime.<br /><br />On the upside, my daughter loves pink and sparkly things.<br />On the downside, I have to take them off her and put them back on her every time we get in the car because they smell so darn bad - I make her put them in the trunk.  We neglected to move the snacks to the front of the car when we moved the shoes to the trunk once... Once."
3.0,I loved this bracelet so much but out of nowhere one of the bars securing the band to the watch just fell off :/
3.0,Liked the hat but it was too large
3.0,"Very cute dress and I received lots of compliments.  However, the slightest breeze will blow up the side of the dress to reveal your underwear.  I had to keep my hands at my side all day to prevent this.  It was also tricky to sit down without the dress opening in the front.  I would recommend wearing spandex shorts underneath and wearing it to something that doesn't require sitting."
3.0,The material for the white pants was very thin and see-through. This company is customer service was exceptional though
3.0,"This bag is a really cute color—young and fun.  Since it has both a wrist strap and a shoulder strap, it offers convenient carrying options. The outside phone compartment snaps securely and has decorative tassels. The inside, as shown above, has slots for credit cards/ID and several folder pockets for cash, etc.  However, this is where the design breaks down.  I would not be comfortable using this bag for carrying anything of significance because the foldover part of the cross body bag is completely unsecured except for a snap. (Note the lack of zipper in Photo 1 above.)  Though there is a small zippered compartment on the backside of the bag, it holds very little. It did come with a complementary “backpack,” a nice bonus (see photo 2 above).  Still, for the lack of security, I could only award the bag—even though it’s stylish—3 stars."
3.0,Not long enough. If you have a short torso and large breasts this will not look good on you.
3.0,"I bought these gardening gloves for my 4 yr old grandson to help me plant some veggies. Anyway, the tops of the gloves are cute & stretchy, but the underside material (palms) is absolutely not. It’s a very thick material but my grandson couldn’t extend his thumb out all the way. So, if your going to get these gloves, which are a good buy, I would recommend getting a bigger size than what’s advertised."
3.0,The material is not what I expected but I still like the blazer.
3.0,"When I got it the two silver studs were not connected so I had to find a small screwdriver to fix it. Looks just like picture, silver links in the back turn my wrist green and I haven't had it in water."
3.0,I got this last year for my baby & simply loved everything about it. I ordered again for this summer (1 year old last week) and so I ordered the largest size 12-18 mo and I feel it is running a bit small. She does not have a big head. The cap just fits now and I don't think it will for the few months I will need it through the summer. It's more 9-12 mo sizing. Bummer
3.0,I bought this because the reviews said it's big. Unfortunately it wasn't big enough for my head.
3.0,"The leg opening is kind of narrow on these boots,  not exactly ideal for chunky baby legs"
3.0,The big face on the watch is nice.  The band broke on the first day.
3.0,It was great. But I have small ears so it didn't fit.
3.0,"It's a lovely suit but according to the instructions I bought a larger size. It was enormous! I tried to return it but I was told by the company that it's too expensive for them to send back so they would be happy to offer me a 20% discount on another item! I can't wear the suit and can't trust the size suggestions to waste money on another item of clothing or a bathing suit! Basically, I have to find someone who can fit the suit. It's sad because it looks lovely but it's just absolutely huge! I'm out $ and no one likes that! Very hard to be sure which size would fit!"
3.0,"I got these for my daughter to wear to basketball games in winter so she could get them off over sneakers. It was still a struggle though because the zippers aren't long enough to make a really big opening at the bottom of the pants. Still possible to remove over shoes, just involved some tugging. I will look for a pair that really goes on & off easily over shoes."
3.0,They started out a normal size sock. Then after washing and trying.... well they dont fit anymore.
3.0,It’s a fun little beanie mask but I wouldn’t buy it again for myself. It runs a little small and my hard ain’t even that big.
3.0,"White is see through. These leggings are comfortable but not good for working out, the high waist does not fit properly and I find myself constantly pulling them up whenever working out."
3.0,Cute but cheap material
3.0,"The sleeves are short, just sit at my wrists. I like them past my wrists. If I lift my arms up they are way to short. The rest of the sweatshirt fit great and is cozy."
3.0,Came with back glass not attached. Fixed it with a little epoxy but definitely annoying to fix something right out of the box. Otherwise looks nice.
3.0,Very cute however the top half is see through so you'll need to wear an under shirt so your goods aren't on display.
3.0,"I bought this for a travel watch, and it was fine.  A bit too big and a bit too many functions, so this is for the man who likes to fiddle with his watch."
3.0,Nice enough top... although somewhat large and the back hangs down longer than most in coordination with the front. Not a deal breaker.
3.0,"It was a little ""cheaper"" looking in person than I thought it would be."
3.0,"Got these for my son for his Halloween costume. He LOVES them and wears them constantly. They’re pretty small and didn’t fit has expected and they have lots of little rips in them. But my 4 year old is happy with them, so 🤷🏻‍♀️"
3.0,I order a size medium  it fits just right .......the material is kind of cheap and the bottom part is a thong not an underwear. 🤔🤔🤔
3.0,Comfy but shows belly of you are not flat.
3.0,"It was a neat piece that my daughter wanted. We got it, she wore it for about a week then it broke. She fixed it somehow & she's happy with it."
3.0,Great material—very soft and has some give.
3.0,"The dress is great. The color of the dress is lighter from the picture.  It's fine, but wished it was like the picture."
3.0,"For both my girls, we needed to size-up."
3.0,Nice and lightweight. Decent lenses. Looks good on me with a nice case. BUT nose pads fell off after four uses. Had to buy replacement pads. Then noticed that the pads are held on by a bent piece of wire that is as thin as a pin. So will prob lose these replacement pads also. Did superglue these tho—hoping to prolong their attachment
3.0,"I really loved the organization pockets and wallet portion. Unfortunately, the magnet is not strong enough to keep that pocket closed. So when my gun was in the holster in the purse, the pocket was always popping open."
3.0,"Cute but the actual tank top has a bigger v cut to it! And it’s pretty short and kind of see through. I have 36inch bust 27 inch waist, 5’5” 130 pounds and in great shape. I can pull it stretch it a bit further down my belly button but it’s short and makes the vneck more revealing with it. Wear this tank with a nude and white strapless bra and very night waisted pants"
3.0,When I ordered this I had no idea it was coming from China and needed it for a shower.  Finally received it and the item is cute but with PRIME I would have expected more.
3.0,"I actually had to return these boots.  They were too small.  The style was very cute however and they might have fit in one size larger.  However, I also didn't feel that they would hold up well in our winter climate in the long run, not even for just casual wear. The boot would work well if you live in a climate without a lot of water."
3.0,Bought this for my husband. He does have a larger size head but this hat just barely fits me. It’s small.
3.0,These are all very cute but I have had 3 break already.
3.0,They are described as effectively reduce glare caused by oncoming intense headlights and bright streetlights. They need to  be stronger for night driving. Bright light from oncoming vehicles still a problem.
3.0,"It is a cute top. However, the material is reminiscent of outdoor curtin fabric, and not a cotton blend."
3.0,Love the concept but shows a little much in my opinion. Would've been better with lining on both the top & bottoms. Color is as shown in pictures.
3.0,"The design is great but if you have a curvy derier like me the fit is a bit on the small side, so coverage isn't as good as I would have liked (only just does the job). I did wear this a lot and found the colour started to come out when rinsing it - which was a pity."
3.0,This is a very beautiful and comfortable blouse. Bigger than I expected.
3.0,"The fabric is of very poor quality.  I have cheap linen pants that are much softer with denser linen.  They didn't flow, they actually stuck straight out on the bottom due to the stiffness of the material.  They remind me of burlap. I returned them both. I am 5;8"", 190 lbs and the XXL fit fine but I probably could have worn the XL.  I like them loose."
3.0,These shoes are very cute and my daughter likes them but the shoelaces are the worst I've ever seen. They are are made out of some material that doesn't stay tied for more than 5 minutes. Going to have to buy some more shoe laces.
3.0,Just got the gloves in the mail today fit really well and are comfortable definitely not waterproof as advertised put the glove on and put it in the sink and glove immediately got soaked...  kind of sad
3.0,Decent purchase
3.0,I ordered the black and grey on xs and I like the grey better than the black. The grey is thicker than the black. The fit is perfect on me.
3.0,"It is light and seems OK quality. It is a little smaller than other 20 inch spinners and most importantly it is NOT expandable despite its description claims so. Also, the inside compartments have less/zippers have lesser bells and whistles than some others I have seen. It is plain."
3.0,The stripes down the back seam aren't any where close to matching.
3.0,Pretty cheap. Loose on my face. Can tell these probably won’t last long.
3.0,Scratchy but effective
3.0,this is a cute shirt but it looks and feels more like something you would ware to bed and not out and about also it could be a little longer. Its not a bad shirt just not what I hoped it would be.
3.0,"material is REALLY thin, almost see through"
3.0,It looks exactly like the picture. I think it's cute but I little cheap looking. It's better if you have another chain you can put it on.
3.0,"It would look beautiful, but it was too small on the torso...and I am very short!! Hopefully they adjust their design and it would be a very nice suit."
3.0,Color looked more like tv static to me and the length wasn't quite what it looks like in the pic.  Also it is stretchy but in a stiff way if that makes sense.
3.0,"Would have given this suit 4 stars, but it runs a little large."
3.0,The fit was not what I expected.  It was for a wide foot not regular size.
3.0,These were average in quality for compression socks.  My mom had vein surgery and had me order her some to wear afterwards.  She had me order these as well as another brand and she liked the others much better.  She said these are nothing like the Medipeds she’s had in the past.
3.0,looks better on line
3.0,I wanted to love this so much but the diamond is big and it sticks up quite a bit. Also the screw part is super long. It's kind of uncomfortable.
3.0,"IT FITS THE THE SUNGLASSES PROPERLY BUT THE SIZE OF THE LENS IS BIG FOR ABOUT 63mm, DIFFERENT SHAPES OF THE FACE IS DIFFERS THE STYLES OF THE SUNGLASSES AND BE SURE TO GET THE EXACT SIZE OF THE FRAME AND THE LENS.BUT ITS GOOD TO HAVE THIS STUFF..THANK YOU"
3.0,LOVED these cozy socks but sent them back after wearing twice. The little &#34;grippers&#34; drove me crazy....felt like I was walking on pebbles and not in a good way.
3.0,"First of all, it is NOT a lunch bag, which I believe I saw it advertised as such. Too big for a lunch bag, and it's not insulated. But it does seem solidly sewn and is a fine bag for toting a few library books or some toys for the kids or whatever."
3.0,Fit great on my 4.5 year old but my son said they were itchy and made him scratch so I had him wear them over another pair of socks.
3.0,Elephant is a solid piece. The links between clip and elephant are not strong enough to hold the weight.
3.0,Not enough support any where.
3.0,Two of them broke immediately.
3.0,"Some background: I have been waving for a few years now and have some experience with multiple products including different types of durags. I decided to try to Tsurag after seeing multiple videos extolling it’s many virtues. I must say, I’m not terribly impressed. It’s not any easier to put on than my regular durag and I don’t get the same compression as I do with the OG rag.  I mainly use it while out and about as a way to tie my hair down after working outside, etc...also, if you’re not careful, the Velcro can cause “runs” when not in use. I find it best to secure the ends before putting it away.."
3.0,"I liked the scarf, but it was not as pictured.  It is more of a mustard color with purple flowers. It would be nice to show close up shots to let customer know exactly what is being purchased."
3.0,small but still nice
3.0,"The fabric is really soft, so the hat doesn't hold shape on your head at all. Brims and parts are flapping and falling all over the place. It fits a little tight, IMO. Keeps some sun out of your face and neck, but could be better."
3.0,"It's not very strong, but it served its purpose for a shadow box"
3.0,I think these tops run a little bit small. Sometimes I have to wear a 3X in a regular t-shirt though 2X fits fine with these tops. It seems like they are just a little tight around the arms. I like the material it's very soft.
3.0,Nice quality but the size chart is off the hat looks nice but is too small on my head unfortunately
3.0,"The idea is great, unfortunately, if you're sitting at a desk using a laptop, or doing something involving arms stretching forward, it digs into your arms constantly.  Your shoulders stay back yes, which is great,  but your arms feel uncomfortable because of the constant strain against the band. I have it at the loosest level and still uncomfortable unless I am just sitting/standing with arms at sides.  Was a bit disappointed about that."
3.0,These socks are ribbed. The image spreads when they are worn.
3.0,Wished the chain was at least 24 inches. Better if chain options were offered. Pendant perfect size. Keyhole slightly rough & leaves a bit of scratches on bare skin.
3.0,"Nice looking product. Good chain length. Crystal are good quality. On the 3rd wear, large center crystal started sliding, will not hold up higher so all three charms now hang on the bottom.  Looks ok but not the way I wanted to have it"
3.0,"Gave it away, size severely distorted"
3.0,"The blue color and fit were fine (though I should have sized up for a slouchy look, but it immediately felt itchy. Fabric content starts with mohair which makes me itch. Too bad, had to go back."
3.0,"Love the concept of this belt.  However, hard to undo belt where wearing it.  Latch to release belt is difficult to open once you wear it"
3.0,"First off I am 5’10 and 160lbs I ordered the red(pink) pants in an XL.  I am somewhat on the fence to whether I like them or not. They are a tad short for my height, but I’m sure the average woman wouldn’t have a problem. I ordered a size up for myself because I wanted them to be loose like harem pants. The material is comfortable but feels like a swim suit and  they are some what see through. I think they’ll be just fine for lounging around the house or doing yard work but I won’t be wearing these out in public."
3.0,Shades broke and lense fell out while wearing them
3.0,"Stones are very small and not sparkly like my other diamonds.  There was no certificate; I'm not sure whether these are real diamonds. The gems are unevenly placed and looks like there's a missing stone. Otherwise, it's a delicate yet sturdy ring.  I ended up returning it because the stones were crooked and I wasn't sure they were real."
3.0,"First I’m 5’1 165lbs ordered a large & it was true to size. I was so excited when I ordered this shirt I just knew it was going to become a favorite addition to my wardrobe! I was so disappointed..one, i got it in white & it was so thin you could see straight thru it which I could’ve lived with however the stripes on the shirt are NOTHING like what’s pictured-which Amazon is making a bad habit of doing-it’s almost like you get a generic version of what’s pictured. So the stripes on the sleeves are an elastic material-looking nothing like the pic-it’s a much tighter elastic which causes it to fit awkward, the sleeve stops at the stripe & gets tight..hard to push sleeve up or down & just looks really strange. I wanted to love this shirt but unfortunately it had to be returned. I regret not taking a photo so everyone could see what it really looks like. I wouldn’t recommend"
3.0,This is a very beautiful set but the stone was more pink than red. Otherwise it was great but it wasn't what I expected.
3.0,"Boy was I disappointed.  It says it is Croat, but it definitely is NOT.  It is very ORANGE.  I like Orange and will use it, but I wanted coral."
3.0,But my first pair then a weekday ripped on top sent them back send me a new pair they fit good the only problem that I have they lasted 5 or 6 months and now they have holes on the bottom do not believe they got my money's worth out of these shoes the bottom should not have worn out as fast as they did
3.0,Fit too big my daughter is 5t and was big but cute outfit
3.0,I don't like this. I don't hate this. I think this would be the kinda shirt I would want to wear a jacket on top because its just so unflattering. Something about the fall of this is just..meh.<br />The material is soft but I can tell it wont last long in the wash. I've worn it once and its already starting to show.
3.0,"I'm normally a 12/14 in women's or 13/15 in junior's jeans. I ordered the XXL, and it's a perfect fit. The quality seems nice, but the color in the  picture isn't what I got. The ""light blue"" choice looks like a medium wash with lighter fading through the legs. What I was sent is almost all the same shade of light blue with the exception of some lighter streaks on the hips. The rips do seem to be in the same spot, but a lot of the knee holes' strings were broken and hanging off."
3.0,They are a cool size but a little bulky it seems sometimes
3.0,"The sleeves were too big and just didn’t look right on me. However, it’s decent top and probably looks better on other people."
3.0,stones are so tiny you almost don't see them on your wrist
3.0,ITS SO SHEER!!! DIDNT WORK FOR ME SUPER CUTE THOUGH
3.0,"My daughter loved it, one of her favorite dresses now is this one.<br /><br />Good it's awesome for party.<br />Bad until you don't wash it and are ok with size dazel."
3.0,I like the fabric & style of the nightie. I ordered a medium but it seems quite large.  I hate the tag stitching!!  It was scratching my back so I cut it out.
3.0,"Pluses are the almost 36"" by 36"" square...The size makes the scarf very versatile.<br />Also the Design and Colors are smart, crisp and bold. However, the big downfall is that the pattern, color and design is not repeated on both sides.  The fabric has a right and wrong side unfortunately!!  So unless you keep the scarf folded a particular way the wrong side of the fabric is colorless and detracts from the best qualities of the scarf."
3.0,"My son loves it and still wears the shirt, but within a month of getting it the seam in the crutch split for no apparent reason."
3.0,"As with so many hats, this one sits low on my forehead and, as a result, obscures my vision.  It's supposed to have and adjustable inside strap, but it really only allows for maybe one eighth of an inch in circumference.  If you have a smaller head, I would suggest not buying this hat."
3.0,Okay for cheaters. Description said the bifocal lines did nit show but they did in person.
3.0,"it is pretty but not near as pretty as it looks on the ad. If I had seen a picture of what it really looks like,<br />I never would have paid $67 for it. You can barely see the birthstone it is so tiny. It is not worth it"
3.0,"I thought this would be a little looser. The chest and arms make this a bit too tight to wear despite my having followed the size guide. I suppose it ""technically"" fits, but it really limits my range of motion and the thin fabric doesn't have much give. I can already picture this ripping along a seam somewhere as I reach across a table.  If you want it to fit loose like the photo go at least a size up from the recommendation on the chart."
3.0,"This did the job, but because of the low voltage system and thin wires it's a pain to work with."
3.0,Potential but sizing is all off. Will return and order two sizes up.
3.0,"The ring is nice but bulky. I originally bought it for a thumb ring but its not as flat as I thought it would be. The size seems .5 larger than what I ordered. I've been wearing it for a week and none of the gems fell out and it didnt turn my finger green. Other than that, it does sparkle and comes in a cute little box. The only downfall is that it doesnt look AS pretty as it does in the picture and I was kind of disappointed that it does look cheap."
3.0,Difficult to zip ...  can’t do it alone
3.0,Seems like good quality but disappointed in the stretch of the socks which made getting them on rather difficult. Will not buy again. May work well for others but not for me.
3.0,"I absolutely loved the gnomes and design ... but, the sweatshirt material used pills excessively.  After every wash, I have to shave off the little balls.  So disappointing.  The weight of the material is satisfactory ... just terrible piling."
3.0,"I own this costume. I bought it just to use as a prop for a literacy program for pre-schoolers. (Guest reader Iron Man comes in and reads to 3 and 4 year olds)<br />Younger children will think you're the real thing but 6 year olds and up will call you on it.<br />The helmet is a 2 piece very cheaply made plastic mask reminiscent of the 1960' and 70's flexible plastic Frankenstien masks with the elastic sting in the back. However the mask is colored very authentically and from a distance looks very good. Ya just can have kids tugging on it.<br />  The suit is a one piece nylon jumpsuit with padded chest and shoulder. Again it looks pretty good from a distance. The closure on the jump suit and helmet are Velcro. you may want to add more. The jumpsuit popped open when I did the ""Hulk"" muscle pose. Also, you'll need to get a red dickie or get a red turtle neck from Goodwill and cut out a dickie. Your neck is very exposed in the costume.<br />When I bought this it only came in one size 42-44. I take a 40L suit jacket. I'm 6'1"" tall and weigh 184 lbs. The jumpsuit fits almost perfectly. I have a 40"" chest, 34"" waist and a 34"" inseam. It would be perfect if I took it in one or two inches in the waist, just to make it look more form fitting.<br />  Again, this is okay for an apperance at a kids party, or If you're taking the kids Trick or Treating. I would not recommend this for the serious costumer or to attend Conventions in.<br />  Oh, I paid $103 for this costume, that included shipping. Honestly, I feel I paid $40 too much. But I didn't see a Deluxe Supreme Ironman for $700 (like Vader or Stormtropper)."
3.0,"This is a gorgeous looking dress. It's A-line design and flare are a little much though. It does not flatter my existing curves, if you have a shorter torso this dress may not look like it does in the photo. I'm super disappointed because I love the pattern and the fabric is great for the price."
3.0,"I am a size S/M usually on top and went with the medium. It was too big. The fabric doesn't have much structure to it at all so it just looks like I'm wearing a big checkered sheet. It is super lightweight and a little billowy, which may be attractive to some people. Ultimately returned it because I'm not playing games with my blazers."
3.0,Nice when it's a little chilly in the morning.
3.0,"I thought I was going to like these...they are soft and warm and I love the part that covers the foot...but they are too tight around the waist! I have tried to wear them a few times and after a few mins I have to take them off because I feel like I can't breathe. I'm a size 2 and 108 lbs so it's not like i'm carrying excessive weight around the middle. If I had ordered the next size up they would have been too long and too wide in the legs. Maybe I just got a defective set, but both the purple and black are too tight for me around the waist. Bummed that I can't wear these."
3.0,These are more like a large not xxl.
3.0,"Looks great on the model.  But I have wide shoulders and large arms and so although the waist fit fine, the upper body didn't.  My daughter said I looked like Shrek when he transformed into a Human and the clothes didn't fit.  Hahahaha.  In any case, the fabric is thin.  I'm sure it's great on other body types.  Just not mine.  And I got an XL which I wear.  This one just didn't fit quite good.  I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm sure it would fit nice on someone else, but body types are always difficult."
3.0,Clips are painful to have on fit more than 1 hour
3.0,"This dress has a stretchy material which is very flattering for curves of any size. However, I bought the dress because I thought that according to the picture it would be mostly light blue in color, which was nice for my nearly springtime events. In person, the dress is mostly dark, I don’t feel as if the pattern is quite as pictured. But if you’re fine with that, then the material is really stretchy and flowy which makes it really flattering and comfortable to wear"
3.0,"Good price, but look very cheap, very thin and wick!"
3.0,Nice design and material. Be aware that there are two types of this product from the manufacturer. One is all cotton with elastic waist and one is cotton/polyester blend with elastic waist. The cotton blend runs a size smaller than the all cotton. I ordered a medium in all cotton--fits fine.  I thought I was ordering the same product again when I got the cotton blend but this was more on the small size (it was pinching at the inner thigh area) rather than medium.
3.0,Very comfortable but the chain snaps easily. Buy a better leash.
3.0,"I always purchase Ralph Lauren apparel and I can count on their fabric and designs to fit perfectly, someone cut the pattern wrong, the collar was bunched up and it will have to be taken apart and remade!<br />by a seamstress.  Very disappointing"
3.0,I moved to a cooler climate and I needed clothes to keep me warmer. It's a long sweater so I can wear with leggings. The sleeves are way too long. It's only the second time I ordered clothes online. I prefer trying on clothes in a store. It works for the pandemic.
3.0,"5'7&#34;, 125lbs, curvy shape<br />Ordered an XS originally bc I couldn't believe the sizing, had to swap for a XXS (never thought I'd be an XXS, weird)<br />I didn't feel as wonderful in the dress as others did, and the straps were a bit weird. There are three, two originating from the left side, one from the right, and they cross in an odd way in the back. The straps are connected to the chest piece inside the hem, meaning there's a 3/8ths-inch hem that isn't connected to the strap, so it kind of sits on your chest. The material is heavy and feels substantial, but the hems look cheap. With jewelry and my hair done, plus existing body confidence, this dress will look pretty good for my birthday party, but it's not the dream the other reviews made me think. The green is a pretty rich emerald, which is exactly what I wanted. I'll update with birthday pics if I remember.<br /><br />Edit 7/16/18 - I couldn't make it look right even with accessories. The straps are flimsy and the hems on the bodice are just poor sewing, reducing from 4 stars to 3 and returning."
3.0,does not look like picture. I returned
3.0,Very big watch. Nice face. The band does look very cheap though. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"The band as a nice look and I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the band is constantly loosening and I find myself having to tighten the band throughout the day which is frustrating. The magnet doesn't appear strong enough."
3.0,Love the style just doesn't fit someone with broad shoulders.  Might want to go a size bigger as well
3.0,"This shawl looks a lot cheaper than the photo.  The fur material is nice but the non fur material is not soft, almost scratchy, and looks cheap.  It's too bad they didn't make this with better softer material because the style was good.  What I did find however was this makes a good piano cover for a full sized keyboard.  I returned it however.  I got the color grey."
3.0,Definitely sized odd.  This was much too small for the size I ordered.
3.0,Loved the set but the hole around the neck was too big .
3.0,The tongue of one shoe came completely out after only a couple of weeks. Still wearable but not well made.
3.0,Great quality but would recommend ordering 2 sizes up if possible
3.0,I bought these to wear indoors while playing cards and they are just a bit too dark for me.  Otherwise great product.
3.0,"This shirt was ok for the price. It doesn't look as luxe as it does in the photo, but it doesn't look altogether cheap either, at least not after to trim all the little threads here and there that are sticking out. Unfortunately, the first time I wore this I got my natural deodorant on it and it did not come out, either with pre-washing or machine washing, so I had to just throw it away. But I liked the color, fit, and versatility. One criticism is the cut of the sides is more dramatic than pictured--they actually go up rather high relative to the front and back and I've found this isn't the most flattering look if have a long torso and you're curvy about the hips. In such case, I would recommend ordering a size up so the rise hits you a little lower.  If you have a normal or short torso, you'll probably be ok ordering your true size."
3.0,The slippers are fine nothing great but not disappointed. And they fit as expected.
3.0,Beautiful dress unfortunately. Cut still too small inspite of ordering 1 sizes up.
3.0,"Fit fine. But not right for me, so returned"
3.0,Fell apart but whatever still cute.
3.0,"I love it!  The color was a little off, but hey it’s ok.  I have a nice cardigan for a great price!"
3.0,"I normally wear a medium. The underbust/band is very large & the bust doesn't have much stretch. Fits a little awkward, but the design is nice. I won't be using this to workout in, unfortunately."
3.0,"The print and fit=perfect and adorable!<br />The fabric=yuck<br />I would love this dress so much more if it were Rayon or Cotton... I live in the South, and polyester is uncomfortable anytime of year...my bad for not reading the description closer"
3.0,Worked out great for our Medieval Renaissance theme wedding attire.
3.0,Large variety but the balls are way too big.
3.0,Love the skirt. I normally wear an 8 so I ordered the medium. It was wayyyy to small. Going to reorder in a large.
3.0,"STOPPED WORKING 2 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE!!!!<br />Bought this for my hubby for our anniversary. I know it isn't the most expensive but it stopped keeping time in 2 months!!!<br />I got it because he doesn't need an expensive watch for work....but come on 2 months!<br />Evidently I can't return it because there is a short window of time and I missed it by a short time.  AUGH~<br /><br />UPDATE: Changing from 1 star to 3 stars because the company finally contacted me and sent a replacement, however no extra links like I asked.  SO far so good but I'm not holding my breath.  I do think it was nice of them to send another so at this point I will keep my fingers crossed, but it's still not comfortable with the band being so tight."
3.0,"They're very pretty, but they came with no backs. Also, they're very heavy."
3.0,The mask is cute but it is extremely thick and makes it uncomfortable to breathe. The design also seems to be flipped and just fits wrong. I unfortunately wear this one when my others are dirty.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:381e4c4c6fb5e812b544751eaba5a3e8]] No adhesion was provided so the oval cover would not stay or snap in.
3.0,"Based on the product image, I was really excited to receive this dress in black. When I opened the package, I was not pleasantly surprised by the material. It's the kind of material you would wear on a halloween costume, not one you would were out for a night out or special occasion. Was looking forward to wearing this as a little black dress for semi-casual nights out but will instead wear this as part of my Halloween costume."
3.0,A lot larger than I expected. Not being worn as a necklace. Now it is being used as a rearview mirror decoration
3.0,"On arrival these look fantastic. Fit and finish are better than I expected. I wear a 36-38"" pant and ordered these in XXL. Fit very well. There was room to fit a pair of padded slide shorts under them while still needing a belt to keep them in the right spot on my hips. Typhon pattern looks really cool too.<br /><br />Unfortunately they lack any ventilation. They are thick and durable, but very, very hot. In my short test fit in my living room they were uncomfortable, and my house is currently 67F. Would be worse outdoors in the summer heat and humidity. There are two zip vents at the hip flexors, which do nothing. The only other vents are the zipped pockets for the inner, softer knee pads. They don't vent once you install the knee pads. So in the end you're going to roast in these.<br /><br />My other issue was the lack of any sort of flex panels. Just squatting down and pretending like I'm hiding in a bunker playing paintball I could feel the material getting tight across my thighs and rear end. Too much of that and stitching is going to burst. In theory I could remove the slide shorts and make more room, but then I have no hip padding for running and sliding into bunkers.<br /><br />These would make a reasonable work pant for someone who spends time outdoors and needs a lot of pockets to carry things. With the padded knees I suppose they'd be decent for someone doing cooler weather outdoor maintenance or construction work."
3.0,"The bands are too large.  I will wear it occasionly but, it is not a winner.  Maybe I will gift it to somone else."
3.0,Nice pajamas but the bottoms were way small.  Disappointed.
3.0,"Colors and graphics were done very well, but the fabric was incredibly thin."
3.0,Baggy chinese junk
3.0,"They were beautiful, but they fell out very easily and got lost. I tend to wear 18g though, and these are 20g. May have just been too small. I'm so sad they are gone already."
3.0,"I was disappointed with the fit. It does run smaller than advertised. It doesn't match the dimensions on the sale page. I would recommend to purchase a size up from your usual. Also, it's hard to tell which is the front and which is the back. There is no inside label to give you a clue. Another issue, this is probably more my fault. The T-shirt isn't T-shirt material like you might expect. It's more a shiny polyester type of material. Had I paid attention to this fact I probably wouldn't have purchased it as it does seem to do a lot of ""static"". Otherwise, it is a nicely printed T-shirt. Arrived sooner than promised."
3.0,Too small..small size
3.0,"Looks very nice, a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Bottom rolls up at times."
3.0,I find this shirt to be a little too sheer.
3.0,One of The socks ripped when I took them off
3.0,Very attractive looking.  It runs quite small.  XXL just fits when an XL normally is a comfortable fit.  There were issues with the pocket being sewn closed and I had to repair it.
3.0,"Had to get 2 sizes larger than my child's actual shoe size, but overall a good product"
3.0,"Easy to install, metal part is NOT rust proof (the knob) but a simple coat in clear nail polish fixes that issue"
3.0,A little bigger and heavier than I had thought they would be but can't beat the price of the $3.89 I paid . The silver plating may not last forever because it may not be of great quality but time will tell.
3.0,Bit on flimsy side
3.0,"These earrings are huge and heavy!!!!!!! I think the dimensions should be in the description!!! THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL, BUT HUGE. They will be a Christmas gift for a friend who likes big earrings!!!!"
3.0,It’s a little bigger than I expected but it’s still a nice fit and good quality. Worth the price
3.0,"Cute dress but wasn’t aware that the hem came up at the side seams, making it higher than knee length."
3.0,Nice looking<br />Not the best quality
3.0,A little thin but great price!
3.0,Leaking warter
3.0,ok but looks better in picture.
3.0,"picture made this product look a little better than actual , but for the price you can't beat it and it's different and comes with earings"
3.0,Looked just like the picture. Sad part is that they make them for really really really skinny people and no matter what size you buy it's going to be small.
3.0,these are more like ankle socks
3.0,"This brand is Chinese made and has an inferior quality appearance... the pictures looks more ""luxurious""  than the actual product.  Save your money... this watch is overpriced and can be found cheaper elsewhere."
3.0,Please check the measurements.  A little small.
3.0,"I'm 5' 3&#34; and 135 pounds. Fit great through the hips and thighs, but the ankles were totally baggy. Didn't look good, and I had to send them back. But the fabric was very comfortable. Well made."
3.0,"Update as of 12/2017 : I was contacted my a representative from Hofish who provided excellent customer service. They offered a full refund to make things right with the item. I'm rather impressed that they contacted me without me taking the time to do so. As I mentioned before, it really was a shame these underwear didn't fit as they were very soft and the colors were very nice.<br />----------<br />These underwear are too tight, not breathable, and do not allow for any squatting, stretching, or significant movement. The legs are too short - brief like - and ride up with activity.  The fabric is very soft and the colors are eye catching, but the other problems are so bothersome that I am not able to continue using them. Very disappointed in this purchase."
3.0,"I like the bright color, and the style details. After washing, some of the seams didn't lay flat like when it was new. I'll wear it, but I don't think the quality will make this a long term item in my closet. It does have value for the money though."
3.0,elastic band broke after second use but i really liked the dress
3.0,"I really do like these gloves but they are not warm. Even in GA these aren't warm enough for extended time outdoors. If you are driving or outside for not a long time these are fine though. I would have rated them higher if the product description hadn't been misleading. Of course, being from Chicago I may have a different idea of what ""cold"" is..."
3.0,Too small and a bit flimsy
3.0,A little small but ok to wear under other garments. Would need a larger fit to be comfortable. But would probably reorder.
3.0,"Its a cute dress. It comes a little bigger than expected and the fabric is very polyester. I was expecting more of a natural fabric, but maybe I didn't read the description close enough."
3.0,"Disappointed. Little drab. Granddaughter hasnt worn yet although she loves cats and stars, so I have asked her if it need a little bling to which she said YES!! Emphatically..this is a 3 yr old! I told her to bring it over and I would put heat set rhinestones on the stars. She said that would make it perfect...why didnt the people think of that?  Lol"
3.0,My daughter is 16 and obsessed with the Heathers.  The size is good.  It is not too tight or loose.  We have already lost 2 charms but she still loves it.  Heathers is an iconic 80s film.  The bracelet charms portray the film perfectly.  I would have paid twice as much for a better quality bracelet.
3.0,While it is very light weight and the design is awesome it did not stay up on my face.
3.0,"These shorts are lose in the crotch. I bought them to provided support there, nice shorts if you dont need that"
3.0,"I’ve purchased several sets of Hottouch PJs and love them for their soft, breathable fabric.  They are always a favorite.  These pants are a straighter cut and the fabric isn’t soft-almost rough.  Wouldn’t buy these again"
3.0,"Made pretty well and very colorful.  However, the yarn is some sort of petroleum product so they don't feel like I have cloth against my skin.  I don't like the 'yarn' that they are made from."
3.0,"Very utilitarian - Lots of capacity. Credit card slots are in the back pocket, not very accessible. Front top large pocket is a big shell, no pockets or dividers. I think the hole for the earbud cord is kind of gimmicky. Not sure if I will keep it."
3.0,Not a butt lifter . But I already got a big booty anyhow I was just hoping for an over the top lift. Still love them super comfy  not squat worthy if your bottom heavy. They are thin. Color is spot on.
3.0,"Beautiful color and design but was too small... I usually wear a men’s L but I buy an XL. Purchased a 2XL so I can wear it like a dress, but it fit snug"
3.0,Seemed like good quality but didn't fit my husband's wrist
3.0,It looks good on my hand the chain is too cheap to fix it . The fixing chain is too loose that it always comes out of your hand. you have manually close each and every ring in the chain. But still it is worth the price
3.0,Coló exacto a la foto pero es de calidad regular
3.0,Product not quite what I expected.  Pendant was smaller than I thought.  Unfortunately with the way it was packaged the chain was very tangled and was unable to be used.  Had to buy another chain as I was giving the pendant as a gift.  I am hesitant to buy anything else.
3.0,I really like the style but the fabric pills after a couple of washings and loses shape.
3.0,"These were cute and easy to put on my 11y/o shoes, but they are not holding up super well. She’s had them about three weeks. The little “knobs” (for lack of better word) that the loops hook around can come all the way out. One was lost completely. However, my child improvised but just tying the whole band in a double knot and went on with her life. I feel like I paid way more money than these things are worth, but they aren’t terrible either."
3.0,"Liked that it was nice and simple -- but over time, the screw-on knobs began to fall off easily because they would get loose when moving around in my purse. Very easy to put your keys in, but gotta make sure it is screwed on extra tight. Almost lost one knob one time, which would have made it useless."
3.0,This dress had potential but the yellow is totally see through
3.0,Collar won’t hold shape after about 10 washes. Disappointing because it would have been a great shirt if it didn’t look stretched.
3.0,After receiving the dress ut just did not work for me. I tried it on several times bought jewelry to dress it up but it turned out the color was dull and I really didn't like it. So I shopped and bought another dress. After my son's wedding I tried to return the dress but it was not returnable due to date and time that left me very annoyed and with a dress I could not use.😤😠☹️
3.0,"This was so pretty and made very well, but I didn’t like the cut?  It was very boxy and made me look like I had no “shape”."
3.0,"These are very comfortable sunglasses. They are lightweight and they fit my head well. however the lens coating is cheap and the coloring of the lens's looks like a fake glare that has been permanently painted on. They work ok, and they are pretty good glasses for the price. I just cant get past the fake glare on the lens's. the color gradient that you see in the picture is really what they look like even when not in the sun. Other than that they are ok sunglasses."
3.0,Not exactly like picture.
3.0,This was very small for the size. I bought a large (14) and it was the size of a small (10). I have boys in both sizes so I can accurately make this comparison.
3.0,The sizes run on the extremely SMALL side.
3.0,"Good fit. The shade is a little weird, so if the sun hits you right in the face it's hard to see through them sometimes, so I just take them off."
3.0,"oddly masculine shirt for a pussy bow top with lips on it haha. The cut isn't very flattering. I'm not sure what would jazz this shirt up other than perhaps bright red pants? Not sure. I'll keep it because i threw away the packing material, but I'm not sure how to wear it to be honest. I'll look for red jeggings and see if I can pull that off, otherwise it'll probably migrate to the part of the closet that houses the wall of purchasing regrets."
3.0,The material is nice and smooth. But Amazon sent me wrong size. I usually wear size small they sent me large :( . I cannot fit in it so I cannot comment on how it fits. I love how it feels. I think I would feel comfortable wearing it to sleep. I like the color.
3.0,"Even though I was aware that it would be a random mix of colors, I was very disappointed in the colors that were picked. I was hoping to have bracelets that could be stacked and worn together but they were such odd choices of color combinations and basic colors that only a couple could be paired together.  The bracelets themselves were well made and very similar to the Lily and Laura brand."
3.0,"This is a very lightweight base layer , I would say that the leggings are like a heavy denier tight and seem fragile. The top is too short , riding up to expose your mid section if you raise your arms. Other thermal tops (from different manufactures) I have had are made extra long to avoid this issue ."
3.0,"Cute! We got them for kids for St Patrick’s Day, but the glitter does start coming off right away and makes a mess and they don’t last long because once glitter comes off, it’s just clear patches. Also they crinkle and get creased easily."
3.0,"I am slightly disappointed in these as they finally arrived and I washed them not thinking to check the tag (my fault) because the description said machine wash... I made sure before I purchased them, when I pulled them out of the washer the decals are coming off and sure enough the tag states dry clean. Just a heads up do you don't ruin yours because they really are soft and cute."
3.0,Love the shirt but runs alil small. Got it a size bigger but still was alil snug on my arms. I like the style and still wore it out for my girls night out
3.0,"The shoes are lovely, but the quality is not good"
3.0,Size chart is wrong! Size up one more then it says
3.0,Runs small... Even using the chart provided by Amazon.
3.0,I like the variety of beads. One broke immediately which makes me weary of the others. Also I’m fairly slim so they are a little larger than I would normally want but they are okay
3.0,"Been wearing/buying Brooks GTS for 10 years.  Was super excited about these but, they are huge.  I’ve been wearing 11.5 and these fit like a 11.85. They looked like clown shoes.  Not the sellers fault, it’s on Brooks.  Now I’m looking for the gts 17 or maybe switching to another brand altogether bc the gts 19 have less medial support than before."
3.0,"Wrist band is very short. I have small wrists, and there are only about 2 holes to spare. Not a lot of length. Also, for some reason, it seems an awkward punch length between holes, bc one is overly tight, and the other would be too loose."
3.0,Beautiful have gotten lots of complaiments but did make my neck change colors
3.0,Too sheer but super cute
3.0,Beautiful but not the name I ordered.<br />Going off what it looks like it feels nice and is good quality. The script is wonderful and can be read from a bit away. Not the best quality but if you're don't have a metal allergy it should be no problem.
3.0,they rip really easily
3.0,Very small.  I was not pleased with the size at all.  I would like to return it.
3.0,Quality is so and so for the price.
3.0,Get what you pay for. They do their job for a one time (maybe two) wear.
3.0,"Cute piece, but my husband had to file down the clasp a bit to allow the pin to engage the locking mechanism."
3.0,Okay.. not great
3.0,a little light weight.
3.0,"Not true to color,looks a lot brighter online then it is unfortunately. I'm keeping it only because I do like all the space."
3.0,"This is very soft and the design is cute.  However, as other reviewers state, the fit is off.  On mine, the straps are very short.  The wrap is not well proportioned.  The top is very large, and the bottom half does not wrap generously.  I have a lot of overlapping material on the top, but the bottom is not as generous."
3.0,Super cute but prettt small and tight. Flattering cut.
3.0,"While I like the feel of these boxers. I was disappointed that despite the claim that there would be 3 colored and 3 white pairs, I received 6 colored pairs, I ordered this set because of the white pairs, but if that isn't what you're looking for, they are soft."
3.0,Ran small...had to send it back
3.0,"The shirt wrinkles easily, like straight out of the dryer has lots of wrinkles. This is over sized all over but the arms. The arm holes were about the right size for a medium shirt."
3.0,"I loved this industrial bar. It is extremely cute and I could not wait to put it in. However, it didn't fit into my ear. In order to put it on, you have to remove both balls and then push one side in and then the other but the cross is in the way of the first side being able to go up far enough to push through the other side. I love it, I just wish it would fit my ear."
3.0,My 2 year old normally wears size 2t-3t but I purchased size 3t-4t to be safe. The 3t-4t was too small for a child who normally wears 2t. It was really cute though I just wish it fits.
3.0,I liked the swimsuit BUT if you got small boobs like mine or just petite in general the bra is very loose and lifts up.
3.0,I weight 225 I choose a xl. I like it because is long. But it has some imperfections in the boob area.
3.0,"This top is adorable on the model, but I was so disappointed when I received my order and it fit beautifully everywhere - except in the underarms. It fit so tightly under my arms that I could barely lift them and when I did the elastic would hop up onto my shoulders. It's too bad because I loved the fabric and the fit otherwise. It seems odd that it would fit so well throughout the bust but be so tight in the sleeves under the arms. That could work fine for smaller people but I'm not a large woman and if I were smaller and the sleeves fit better I think I would be swallowed up by the rest of the top. Sorry it couldn't work for me. The top shipped and was delivered quickly."
3.0,I was hoping to get these for my toddlers crocs. She wears size 4/5 but unfortunately they did not fit. Perhaps these were made for adult crocs but did not serve my purpose. I ended up returning.
3.0,I need a small size
3.0,Okish but not super
3.0,"I'm not displeased with these socks but I'm not impressed. I don't believe I'll be buying again. I'll forgive the price as they were shipped from the UK to the US, but I've purchased far better socks for the same price. The only advantage I can see to buying this brand is the exceptional array of colors they offer. If you can't find the color you want elsewhere, then go for it."
3.0,The fabric could have been better.
3.0,Cheap material but I still wear it just for the saying.
3.0,were a bit tight
3.0,"I'm already familiar with clothes that come from China/overseas, so I knew what to expect when ordering. My 11 month old is typically in 9m clothes and 6-12 fit her perfectly. My only complaints are that there were pieces of elastic just hanging loose around the legs and the tie for the bow is way too small! Clothes from China come with the bow undone - this wasn't a shock, since I've ordered these kinds of clothes before. However, if you're going to provide the fabric, at least make it long enough to tie around the baby's head! I could barely knot it and there was no way I was making it into an actual bow. Kind of a bummer, but we made do with just the outfit."
3.0,It's completely different from the picture it's the same style but the design is different and also the belt that came with it was made very bad. The dress is ok but not what i expected.
3.0,The pants is a little too large and long
3.0,"I have arthritis in my feet, the shoe did not have enough cushioning in the front of the shoe. My toes really ached after wearing them for a short time.<br />I would not recommend these shoes if your arthritis are in your toes."
3.0,"This is an attractive sports bra at a great price, which is hard to find for larger breasts but I am not sure I would say it &#34;supports&#34;.  It pretty much smooshes them down which, while effective, is not exactly what I had in mind.<br /><br />That being said- It is pretty much what I expected for the price. I will not be returning it but I don't think I would purchase more."
3.0,Well it is nice but a little tight for a size 9 ring. It is to tight on my finger. I have other rings that are size 9 and fit comfortably on my finger.
3.0,didnt like how it looked on me at all
3.0,"I bought these as a replacement for my no-name fingerless wool gloves from the local sport mart. Unfortunately, while nicely made, they're VERY small. My wife tried them on and they fit her perfectly. She absolutely loves them."
3.0,It's a bit tight on all the wrong areas. I'm guessing it's fitted for more slender body type and not for men who works out or thicker in build. Other than that it looks ok and wish it is a bit more stretchable.
3.0,They are really secure and hold in everything however it ran too small for me
3.0,"I think it's good for the price. Don't expect great quality, I broke one putting it on. They are cute though, I just can't see anyone getting more than a few uses out of them before they break."
3.0,"Update 6/26/17 many bars on the links brake:( didn't hold up after 3-4 times wearing it:(:(<br /><br />I love it! the paint doesn't scratch, but i wish the links had a middle size. because of my smaller sized wrist it is not easy to put on the apple watch!!! and can scratch it. it s heavy but a ok buy for the price."
3.0,"There nice but to big of a frame, these fall off my face if I lean forward. Other than that they're nice and fashionable"
3.0,"I ordered the neon pink, thinking it would be the same color as what is represented in the photo. It is a light bubblegum pink, and not the neon pink shown. The sweatshirt is lightweight and comfortable, but I was very disappointed that the color was not at all the same as the photo."
3.0,They’re ok but 3 of the pins had dents and paint scratches. They were bunched up in a small ziploc bag and that’s why I think that happened.
3.0,It was very sticky to work with and fell off almost right away.  The goop got stuck in my hair and was a headache to get out.  If I had more experience working this type of stuff it may have worked better.
3.0,wore it for Halloween Velcro inside of neck scratched neck a lot.
3.0,"I bought these for a trip to Bali, since much of the time would be on the water. The sunglasses are ok, but the frame is not great quality for the price. The floatability is great! Lenses are good. On day 1, the screws started out loose and I need to constantly tighten. Also the frames misshaped easily, bowing out and getting loose when on.<br />They do the job, but I would expect better at the price. Better quality frames would have gotten this to 4.5/5"
3.0,I'm not a big fan of what material they used as filler it makes the strap feel like a stiff plastic and I dont think it will break in very well over time. im also not a fan of the brown finish on the band it makes it seem like it wont patina over time but will just scratch off instead.
3.0,"gadget holder is good idea, BUT bands need to be tighter and have some be large enough to fit such things as voltage conventers"
3.0,"the dress feels a little rough, its not soft material. This dress is cute though."
3.0,"Would be a good purchase, but the sizing is way off.  Very tight and squashy."
3.0,Very nice but much too small. I'm a normal sized woman but it was too tight. And it didn't have much stretch. If you have very thin wrists or are getting it for a young person it would be nice.
3.0,Ears are very cute. Ears are not as thick as the Disney Ears. Disappointed!
3.0,The bracelet is cute the problem I have with it is in the description it stares it has metal charms but in fact they are plastic so I'm not pleased
3.0,I like the way they fit & feel but wish there was more squishy stuff - my hands still go numb when I'm riding.  :(
3.0,fits a little big. I might could get a size down but then it would be too small. I still wore it on the really hot days. maybe its not a good dress for my body type.
3.0,"The top is cute-ish. The ties are WAAAAY too long, so you either have to double wrap or have them hanging down halfway to your knees. Any way I wrap it though gives it a maternity top look. Maybe if you're tall and super thin, or maybe small busted, but I am on the short side, athletic build, with an average bust, and it's a no for me."
3.0,nice !!
3.0,I gave it 3 stars because I’ve washed it numerous times and can’t get the vinegar smell out of it. When wearing it for 12 hour shifts at a time the front part of it the collects to “sweat” from the forehead becomes itchy
3.0,"The zipper was not sewn in and as soon as you unzipped it, the entire zipper came off. It was missing several beads and did not have a replacement packet. Completely gorgeous, though. I hated to send it back. To be fair, I ordered 2 dresses, this one and a similar one. The other was perfect. Stunning. Very fancy, not a kaftan for pool parties and such. I’m wearing mine to a ball, so it is as ritzy as a prom dress."
3.0,I had already ordered larger than needed but didn't know I needed to order even larger. Return!
3.0,"Keeps the big clean, but it gets stinky, even with thorough cleaning. Running through washing machine removes most of the smell"
3.0,"I ordered two sizes up based on size chart advice and how some of the postings with photos seem much tighter than I would be comfortable wearing especially if the top is pulled apart to an overly revealing view.  I wear a medium but bought an XL, it's too big and the V top is all the way up to past my collar bones, lol. The waist bags and the shoulder seams are off my shoulders and out on my arms but I like how the bottom is bigger in this size.  I don't like for things to cup my rear.  I could see going one size up if you don't want to look hoochee in the dress but not two sizes. My mistake. I think I was getting all of these size charts mixed up as I was looking at several different dresses.  I tried a leather matte bronze belt to hold in the waist and I liked how it looked with the ivory.  It has that equestrian classy look, ivory with bronze and would look great with matching suede boots.  I can pin gathers into the top which are non-existent as is and it will take up the extra fabric and maybe pull the shoulders in too, or I can return it and reorder the L.  I thought the top of the dress had gathers where it crosses like long diagonal pleats but it doesn't, it lays flat on the top. Wish it were lined.  5'5&#34; 144 lbs. hour glass body type, length hits me just to the bottom of my knee.  I'm up ten lbs from my normal weight errrr."
3.0,"So, I like to wear a watch around the house and when I sleep. I have a decent sized watch collection, but few things I consider to be my home utility watch. I wanted to add to that collection, so that was the mindset I had for this piece. This piece has a lot of history, which is cool, and it serves the primary function of telling time fine. However, there is some utility it lacks, and in all honesty I would tell you to pass on this watch. So hear is what I can say:<br />Intended Use: Around the house utility with need for in the dark functionality.<br />That said it fared ok at this. It is pretty small, but very clear to read. It is a very small thin watch, even on my skinny wrists, but still is able to be read in a lit room or outside easily. I do enjoy that I do not notice it, which makes it easier for doing tasks without snagging it or having it impede mobility.<br />The negative is that this light is the worst I have ever had on a watch. You get the hour and that is about it. This really killed the use for me as I like to be able to check the time quickly at night without the use of my phone.<br />Also, I use my watches for cooking, and without a countdown timer, there goes another aspect of functionality I would like. Remember it has a stopwatch, but no countdown timer.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to spend an extra ten bucks and get the really cool Casio World Time that gives you a better light, timer, stopwatch, and different time zones for travel. It is also a lot bigger and easier to read at night. I greatly prefer that watch.<br /><br />This watch however does do a killer job of telling you the time and date, and if you are looking for something with the least amount of wrist-presence while telling you the time effectively then this is a great watch. If you want much more out of it, there is a lot better for not a lot more money."
3.0,Pretty..but no support for 38 C.
3.0,"The one that fit was great, one the strap accross the top in the back about cut my neck off, the other was slit so far up my leg I couldn't wear it out in public and the third was perfect. All the same size,"
3.0,"The quality material and the fact that it has the bra hook at the back was what captured my interest to purchase this sports bra. Regrettably, it didn’t fit. I wear a size 34A bra and so I bought the small, which is the smallest size available. It fit but it didn’t hug the way a sports bra should. I think it’s because the small, like the other sizes, fit a range of sizes."
3.0,No arch and flat sole but nice look and feel
3.0,"Unfortunately, they are a little too large for me...but with a pair of thick socks it will work...The material is not the greatest, but I decided not to buy shoes on line anymore....I believe shoes and clothing need to be seen and handled before purchasing....Lesson learned."
3.0,No son comodas
3.0,Didn’t realize they were plastic
3.0,It was a good looking watch but not enough bright for me. I had to send it back.
3.0,My son loves Preston and this is his favorite shirt! My son is 7 and tall and skinny.  A little expensive in my opinion- it's just a cheap t-shirt with screen printing on it- it's the licensing that makes it costly. Oh well- my son is stoked for it!
3.0,"The dress has a great fit, and the price is also good"
3.0,I never wear gold but I needed it for an event. This gold tone was an obvious tone which just went horribly with my fair skin tone. It just didn't work for me. Returned.
3.0,"Very high quality BUT it was an XL, not a L/XL as listed in the description. I can normally wear a L without issues but this was too large. Too bad because it was very well made."
3.0,"I was looking for gold, silver, rose, n bronze colors.. Instead these are painted charms they will not work with artwork that I have in mind.."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:641312cb2b7bdc3dd2e52882abd028de]]Update: I still love the value of these but would like to bring up the issue of false advertising. I took my loupe apart and found out it is only one lens, not a doublet as currently advertised in the title (11/14/15) or a triplet as printed on the box.<br /><br />I paid $6.15 for two of these jeweler's loupes and could not be happier with them!<br />I just needed a very basic hand lens and after spending an hour on Amazon trying to make a decision I decided to try these out.<br />I have no way to determine actual magnification which is a complaint some people have made about this product but it's great plenty for my needs.<br />It feels like it's of good quality and is made out of sturdy material. I really like the tension on the pivot; it's tight enough to really hold the lens in the position you move it to. The video shows the actual product I received.<br />The description says doublet but the box I received says triplet. I can't really tell if there's a third lens inside or not."
3.0,I bought them for my wife who’s a school teacher’s aide.
3.0,Not a good quality.  Too thin.
3.0,"Whoever sized these shoes is way off. A 6.5 US is a 4 UK. It's not a 6 like these claim. In any case, these are way too big for my feet. It's too bad because they are nice and well-made esp for synthetic leather. I would wear them if they fit."
3.0,I got longer ones than expected. I thought you could order them all in 1 size. I'm pretty bummed out because I won't be using 4 of them because they're too long .. but the 2 small ones are perfect.
3.0,Buyers be aware that the black tutu is stitched onto white elastic which is quite noticeable in the item I received. If you look carefully at product photos #4 and #6 you can see this. Mine is somewhat more noticeable so rather disappointing.
3.0,Lovely dress I just purchased it too big so can’t say much .
3.0,Tops run very small! Order larger size.  But the material feels really good!
3.0,"Good quality and very cute but the fabric is a lot more stretchy/clingy than it looks in the pictures. It’s a fitted T-shirt, not a T-shirt."
3.0,"Cute top. Decent quality. Big boobs beware you WILL fall out of this!! Actually, I'd say all boobs above an A cup beware haha.  I recommend some dress tape and maybe even some pasties just in case."
3.0,"I purchased this on March 6, 2020 in green. The color is very vibrant and the material is soft and smooth. The only problem is the clasp broke today on April 23. The clasp is a cheap plastic, I'm shocked it lasted as long as it did. Other than that, I'd have give 5 stars."
3.0,"I was happy with how this looked, but it didn't stay around the highchair with the glue dots provided. I ended up having to use tape. I am going to use it for her birthday again this year, but without the ""one"" sign."
3.0,Nice but the sleeves was short and tight.
3.0,Fell apart within two weeks of having it.
3.0,Cute shirt but too small
3.0,"Got what was expected for the price.<br /><br />Was not broken when arrived, no real complaints considering the price, not something I would order again though"
3.0,My son says they look awesome but are way too big.
3.0,"I love the style and how soft the material is. Downfall is the strap around your neck doesn’t fit tight, it kind of droops and u can see the threading.. other than that, the shirt is sexy and fits awesome. Will upload pics soon"
3.0,This item did not come with pins as advertised in the picture.
3.0,The materials and color are great.  I did not like all of the seams at the top; it gave it kind of a boxy shape
3.0,Pretty dress for special occasions.  Kinda low cut and very short.  I'm 5'4 and it's VERY short on me.
3.0,"This piece is visually pretty, however, it didn't fit me as well as I would have liked with the decoration disappearing into my navel.  The area surrounding the piercing got pretty red (I have sensitive skin) so I won't be wearing again.  I wish this would have worked out better."
3.0,"Not what I was looking for, but very nice product. I did not keep them."
3.0,"I must have a very big head, lol.  I absolutely love everything about this hat with the exception of the size.  I struggled with keeping it on my head for hours.  It just keep rising from the crown of my head.  If it were just a tad big bigger it would have deserved 10 stars."
3.0,Feel good except small gap around nose area.
3.0,It is actually a cute dress. The sleeves are nice. I got a medium and it fits loosely. It is very see through tho and I would have to wear a slip. The sleeves make it very nice tho.
3.0,Neck not flattering.  Color darker than expected.  I returned.  Just not what I thought it was.
3.0,I loved the shirt but the shorts were defective! The left leg was shorter than the right!
3.0,"Pros:  Nice cut, nice design, I love the way it looks on, BUT<br />Cons: Get a size larger than you need, material is rather scratchy, but hopefully it will soften with wear, who knows how long this will last or if it will shrink in the wash."
3.0,Runs a little small and shorter than pictured
3.0,I like the style but the fabric is thin but i think it will pass unless i stand in the bright sun with my legs apart! The waist rides up a bit and I’m not large busted. I purchased a M and I’m 5-2 145 36B. It is plenty big around so odd it does this. Its not bad and I’ll  make it work with a belt. Its cute on.
3.0,"They cut into my eyes, but look real nice."
3.0,Great buy BUT if you wear a Large t-Shirt but the XL tank . Large is too tight
3.0,Skull cap is exactly as described and good quality. My only issue is it is too big. Sits very loose on my head. Slides off. If the band was elastic and smaller then the circumference of the cap it would stay in place. I wanted to use it under my motorcycle helmet. I opened the package and wore it once. I’ll have to keep it as to return it would be more than it’s worth
3.0,"The dress was a little bit bigger than expected, I typically wear a medium. The V neck is a very deep v, it would be challenging to wear a bra without being seen. Zipper is a little rough to use. The length is fairly modest, I'm 62'' and it hit at the knee. Didn't seem to be made with the best quality, however, the price is very reasonable for the product."
3.0,I must say I was a tad bit disappointed in these when I received them. The photo makes them look like a rose gold but they are very gold. The earring backing was tarnished and the earrings themselves were on the dull side. I did wipe them off with made them shine a little bit but nothing like the picture. They are still cute but just not as cute as the photo presented. I have attached photos for your review.
3.0,Great quality socks but they run small.
3.0,Discolored very quickly<br />  Even with protective coating I had added to it.  Wish it would have stayed as originally done.
3.0,The bag is to small but a good  bag
3.0,Thin material and fit weird. returned for refund
3.0,"Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.... And with these leggings my 3 year old looks like a little Queen, she just needs a crown, and a few corgis and a king and a palace and a country to rule over!"
3.0,The Jewelry looks good and feels good but no earing is shaped quite the same as its matching pair. Plus I only got three fourths of what I ordered... kind of obnoxious.
3.0,"Wish I had known they were pleaded, can't get work boots on in them. Pretty much useless for me. If you're going to get cargo pants, they should make it loose enough for boots."
3.0,"A great leotard, but not for anyone larger than a B-cup.  A medium should have fit and did everywhere but the chest and an XL still did not fit despite the sizing chart stating it should. Sadly, had to return it, which was too bad because it was so cute and well made."
3.0,"I ordered this hoping that it would be the dark blue navy that is seen in the picture, wanted it to match my dress. Sadly its not. Its more purple. I gave it three stars because it is cute and the size I wanted. Even though its not the color I wanted, I still like the color."
3.0,"The waist runs very, very small. I bought a medium and luckily have a small enough waist to wear it because of my body shape. At 150 lbs, I have a 29' waist so can wear it once I get it past my hips! But it's very fitted. I wish I had gone up a size. It looks cute on, it's just a simple knit skirt, I bought the purple and wear it with a black top. Not bad, not fantastic."
3.0,Shipped fast but size runs small
3.0,"It is a bit smaller than it should, buy two larger sizes"
3.0,This was cute and looked like shown. Everyone said it ran small. I got a xsmall and it was still super long. I'm 5' so I expect things to be long but it's weird that other emphasized how short it was. Glad I didn't order larger.
3.0,"So far, so good. it okay!"
3.0,The colour is not as bright as shown on amazon page. Disappointing! But the flowery design pattern is ok. The fabric is also ok.
3.0,very cute but way too small
3.0,"very cheap seeming. It was like the thinnest of thin leather, fused onto cardboard. LIke the other reviewers stated the credit cards don't really fit in the slots. When I was 'setting' it up, It ripped on a seam while putting things in an envelope area.  I'm keeping it anyway, seeing as how sending it back is more of a pain in the ass."
3.0,They are nice for cheap sunglasses at first I bought 2 pairs and both faded to purple after about a month
3.0,Simple. Good for the price
3.0,"I'm not that impressed with this purchase.  The hat and gloves are a bit large.  I'm 5'6, 130....average size, and the hat bunches up on top of my head and the fingers are too long on the gloves.  The gloves are also pretty thin and not made very well.  I won't purchase this brand again."
3.0,"Buttery soft, nice high waist. Fit fine, not snug  on me, I am usually a size 6 petite. No butt lift as stated perhaps due to my size however the material seems too light weight for that. Should fit at least to a size 10. Not sure about smaller than Size 6. I purchased the 3 set mainly for the Purple color which unfortunately is not Purple to me but more of a Berry Wine color. The  Complexion shade is a bit odd, looks more Beige in some light but slightly Pinkish in other lighting.  The Dark Pink is similar to shown - not dark or bright & but muted."
3.0,Pretty cute daughter loved them
3.0,"I may be one of the pickiest people when it comes to workout pants...I’m around a size 6 to 8 in lululemon depending on material, S in colourfulkoala.<br /><br />Pros: fun color and print, squat proof, no camel toe, super soft<br /><br />Cons: if you have thicker or muscular legs and glutes the print will make your bottom half look much bigger than reality, almost too stretchy and I should’ve sized down"
3.0,Beauriful wig & good quality....<br />Only problem i had was the bangs are to long.
3.0,nothing special about these. certainly could have used the money for someting better.
3.0,It's not cut well and more ivory than white ..not a fan of the material but I'll wear it .
3.0,The design is an actual cut out.  I didn't like it.  I did not hate it either.  I returned it.  It was not the quality I was looking for for the Mother of the Groom dress.
3.0,Not quite like the picture. My necklace does not have a zebra look to it at all and the colors are more greyish. I would not have purchased it if I had seen in person.
3.0,I own one of the fully stocked kits and bought this for extra equipment.<br />Unfortunately this is not the same quality as the original bag.<br />Thinner material and wimpier straps that slip.<br />Expected more for the price.
3.0,Too big for a piercing
3.0,"If the pattern lined up from front to back, it would absolutely be 5 stars."
3.0,I have no idea if these were real or not. I got them for my daughter. When she tried them on the logos were on the inside of the shoe where nobody would be able to see them. I thought maybe she put them on the wrong feet but she didn’t. I always thought they were on the outside. What’s the point of having it there if nobody can see them? I returned them anyway. I’ll go see how they are in the store. If they really come that way I will not be buying them again. It looks really stupid
3.0,doesn't fit the way it is supposed to. The side cuts are too low so there for you have no support. Will not purchase again.
3.0,fabric looks cheaper than expected and I'm 5'5&#34; and it was very long
3.0,They fit perfect and look cute. But are way difficult to put on and take off especially if you're like me and will only wear it for a short time. If I was one to leave it in permanently I would of given them 5 stars.
3.0,"Nice detail on the front, and I love that they are made of hematite. A bit heavy and large for me. I must have read the description too fast because I thought they were 1&#34; long, they are actually 2 1/2&#34; long.<br /><br />They were too beautiful to return (not to mention the $3.99 shipping return), so I use one as a pin and the other is being used in a wire wrap craft project."
3.0,Cute design but too big for my 10 year old. We will have to tack down the elastic to make it fit more snuggly.
3.0,"OK... so I didn't get these.  But the description left me wondering.  It says it gives protection.<br /><br />IF someone needs &#34;protection&#34;, is a sticker the way to go?"
3.0,"Super cute little dress, flattering cut. The dress came folded in a bag, when I took it out to hold it up the polka dots had stuck to each other and when pulling apart, it removed the color. There were also a few spots on the green where you could see some of the pink had rubbed off onto it."
3.0,The charm is much bigger than I imagined.  It's very pretty but too big for the bracelet.
3.0,"Little small for my wrist , but it’s ok."
3.0,They re nice material but too short in the body for me. I only wear in private pools
3.0,Love them but within a week a couple of them broke off :(
3.0,Parts of the kitchen were scuffed. A few pieces such as sink handles and knobs did not hold up for even a couple days. The parts came undo because the screw stripped out the wood. My kid still loves playing with it.
3.0,too small for the event.
3.0,"I'll try to update this later, but I researched and then bought this hoodie with some trepidation. All the reviews I have found online are basically paid for by WoolPro, which honestly, makes sense to me for a small company to make a name for itself. The reviews here also seem to be questionable, as the first review follows the same outline as the description, pretty much.<br /><br />So here's why it's currently 3 stars and why I hope I'm wrong. I've used synthetic baselayers for years. My midweight is the ECWCS Polartec Grid Fleece, which I believe converts to 230g. I also recently bought a Smartwool 150. Both seem heavier than this shirt rated at 250g. I'll also add that the packaging makes no mention of 250g. Again, I'd prefer to be wrong here and maybe it's just super dense, but in the hand, I'd say it's something like 130g."
3.0,I'm 5'3 and the XS was too short for me.
3.0,I bought 2 - black and red. The red is perfect and looks great. The black has no give! I couldn’t get my head through the neck hole! I wish they were a little more consistent with thier product.
3.0,Love the weight of the chain . wasn't the color I requested I wanted silver polished got frosted color
3.0,I like the bracelet and I like the box it comes in- but as a gift to someone it is missing the description and meaning.
3.0,Face mask is comfortable but bad design on the lining.
3.0,Gown looked different in person then pictured. Was missing strap to tie up the back.
3.0,I have small wrists and it’s still too short for me
3.0,I bout these for myself but the look more for a teenager
3.0,"Overall fit was fine, I though the waffle pattern would have been both inside and out but is only on the outside, also I would have preferred that the tie was loose not sewn to back but I'll live with it."
3.0,I love the cap but really dislike the fact that it will not stay on no matter what throughout the night.
3.0,"Enexpinsive, so probably ok for price."
3.0,"This bracelet is pretty but extremely small. I also got it damaged, but that a different issue. Only purchase if you are wrists are small."
3.0,q<br /><br />Material not what I expected.
3.0,Paint was dried off the side of one of the petals.
3.0,"The fabric came way more pink than shown in the photo. Also they are a bit small, I wear size 9 and they are snug. I wouldn't buy if you were a 9 1/2 or bigger shoe size. Not the best sock slippers I have purchased but definitely not the worst. Decent enough product."
3.0,Serves the purpose and cute fabric. The pockets are a little loose for normal sized chapstick and the metal clasps odd.
3.0,"This backpack is really very nice but the straps move all the time cause there are two in each side and you have to adjust the metal to change the lenght but it just slips all the time so you need to adjust it constantly. It also slips from the shoulders to the sides all the time on the move. That is why it is not that nice. Otherwise, its perfect."
3.0,"It's cut pretty big. So of your a 2x looking for something roomy, order the 2x not the 3x lol.<br />Thats said, the stitches are holding together fine after 4 washes.<br />4 washes because this thing sheds worse than a cheap towel. White cotton everywhere. Im just trying to get it to where it doesnt put clobs of lint on everything i wear.  Ill probably have to take the &#34;shaver&#34; to it and then roll,  roll, roll.<br />I cant help but think if I'd  spent +$10 i coulda ordered one with less work in just wearing it.<br />Meh."
3.0,"The product was very beautiful and appeared to be of good quality.  However, I am tall.  Unfortunately, the 35"" necklace was too short.  I had to return it.  I m hoping I can find one exactly like this but longer.  I need one that is about 40"" long."
3.0,My specific bracelet was off colored. It was more red than maroon.
3.0,Nice..but shorter than others.
3.0,It is cute but HUGE. Looked like I was wearing my dads clothes.
3.0,"Given the picture, I expected the dress to be a little bit short and therefor ordered a larger size. Even in a larger size, the dress was small. Did not fit as depicted, sleeves are tight and waist is slim as well as short skirt. Order larger than expected."
3.0,I really like it ecxept for the fact that it's REALLY bulky
3.0,"This is so cute! Quality is very poor, the back and the top already looks worn so i cannot give as a gift. Bought two but will keep because it is so inexpensive anyway."
3.0,My dress has a hole in it and there is no where to message the seller
3.0,The shirt is very nice but the coconut buttons get caught up in the button hole and snag the fabric. I will change out the buttons after I exchange this one for a larger size.
3.0,I ordered the medium/large and they were to big for me.  I wear a 12 and I should have ordered a medium!  Nice Material but they didn't fit.
3.0,"I'm overall satisfied with these, but I liked the Nautica men's captains herringbone pajama shorts a little better. That one had a softer cotton weave that was also slightly thicker.  Also, I bought a large in this, and I am nearly swimming in them. Have to tie the drawstrings to keep them up. I am 6 foot tall, 173 pounds, and 34 inch waist. Not bad enough to send back, but if I were to get them again, I would get the medium."
3.0,Not what I was expecting.  Too big and not the best material.
3.0,"I would have given a 5 star, but one of the earrings has a bent post. Very cute. Dainty design."
3.0,It was too small with poor quality material
3.0,too high on ankle for me
3.0,Size.... I need either an XL slim or a Reg L. Please provide RMA info so I can return the shirt and get the right size
3.0,"I am a 40"" waist so I got the 44"" length black belt as I am currently losing a lot of weight and I didn't want to start out cutting the belt. I received the item and the belt didn't even come close to fitting which is a bit odd as there should be a 4"" excess and it didn't seem like I was getting even close to that. I measured the belt and it turns out, the 3.5"" buckle is included in the overall length but it is not described as so. Factoring in that roughly an inch of the belt is held within the buckle and I was left with an actual belt length of about 39"" to work with and could not use the belt. I have returned for a refund in which I will be replacing the belt with a longer length now that I know how it is measured. Could have saved allot of time if the description was more precise but you live and learn.<br /><br />I don't usually get belts with buckles so I was unfamiliar with this practice of measurement if it is common to include the buckle or not. I have up until now gotten belts with a simple dual metal ring at the end so I am use to the length of the belt being simply the belt part itself. The quality of the belt when example was terrific and the aesthetic was very pleasing even more so than the pictures. I look forward to getting the replacement, as cheap as it is, it is a very nice belt, just make sure you get the right size and understand that the measurement they give describes the belt part and buckle."
3.0,purchased a large - fit like a medium (quite snug).  Had to give it to my son - fits him well (it is nice and warm too)
3.0,Absolutely love this bag.  Quality is good and the appearance is beautiful.  I have received many compliments.
3.0,Nice looking until you get closer and see it is poorly made.
3.0,I ended up returning these.  They were cute but felt like one more unnecessary thing in my closet that I didn't really need.
3.0,So could almost pass for perfect if they could just extend the length. The only gripe I have with this product.
3.0,"it's very small.  A XL which I purchased, actually fits a medium size person.  If I do order again from this company, I will take the much smaller size, in consideration."
3.0,"I just gave 3 stars because I finally had time to check them out and, the extra layer over the big toe, is (not) over the big toe, it is in front of the big toe.  I don't know about you, but I don't kick stuff with my toe.<br /><br />I do know however, when American slaves work so hard there is little time for clipping toe nails, the big toe nails make their own hole and pop up through the top of the shoe where the extra layer of leather SHOULD be."
3.0,"The bottle opener is sturdy enough, but the compass tends to fall out."
3.0,Difficult to engage.
3.0,But I did love the pants
3.0,"They are very cute and stay up when you are running, however the pocket on the inside is a little plasticy feeling and super itchy. I can't wear them for longer than I run in them."
3.0,"This dress is really cute, nice color and decent fit.  The reasons I did not give this 4 or 5 stars is that the elastic on top is a bit tight so if you have a few extra pounds can be unflattering and the pockets sit right on the sides of your hips.  If you are curvy, it can look unflattering.  Still not a bad dress for the price."
3.0,"Not brighter than the picture.  Nice try vendor planting favorable reviews.  Since I needed them by Halloween, I'll wear them anyway and send the stinky versions back.  Enjoy my manly!"
3.0,Cute but fall out very easily. Also creates the appearance of a weird skin bump because of the empty space in the middle
3.0,"Had to roll the sleeves because they were too wide and short, but I’m 6’1. Cheap material too but it’s not too bad for the price"
3.0,"Looks a bit different than pictured - much lighter suede and extra stitching near buckle. Also does not come with a tool as indicated in the last picture, meaning a jeweler will need to be paid or a tool purchased."
3.0,Pretty glasses but not comfortable at all.
3.0,It's ok - cute - but just ok.
3.0,"nice looking, I am a little disappointed in my purchase due to size of case 40mm. BOS has amazing packing and watch box."
3.0,The jacket is very average. It's not terribly yellow... but bright enough to draw alot of attention. Overall don't get your hope's up for this jacket if you're a rdr 2 fan
3.0,"It didn't fit as I thought. But did reordered a different size. Loved the look of the bra, that is why I reordered"
3.0,"At first, the best was a popular sensation at work. Everyone liked how it offered more pockets then the standard vest that was provided. With more pockets, it allows for someone to carry a lot more weight. The pockets are not designed to withstand more than a pen or paperclip which is very disappointing, especially for the current price. Since more people ordered this vest, inflation occurred. Within working a minimum 40 hours-maximizing 60 hours a week, working a month and a half in at my current job, the vest ripped on the inner side mesh pocket. I currently do not wear this vest and I have not bought another one. I wish this was more durable."
3.0,The mother-in-law loved it she said she loves the feel of it.
3.0,Ran a lot larger than expected. Material nice but oddly heavy and very clingy. Had to return due to size.
3.0,"This chiffon blouse is not particularly impressive. It is cut too short, especially for big busted women like me. I wish the length of this was longer, in the torso, so that my bust wouldn’t lift the material up like a tent. This is fine to wear around the house, but I would opt for a blouse with a better cut, fit, and style for wearing out. This blouse does not accentuate and flatter my waistline. Since this fits snugly in the chest area, I recommend busty women to order one size larger than usual."
3.0,fit a little akward; seemed &#34;clingy&#34; in areas and would not lay right.
3.0,"Bought this in dark green. I'm normally a large but I bought XL because I needed it sooner than later. This worked out to fit the way I wanted it, so I recommend sizing up if you want a slightly flowy fit.<br /><br /> The color and material were amazing. It is not chiffon, but more of a medium thickness Jersey material, but it felt amazing nonetheless.  Unfortunately,the sash at the back of the blouse was too long and bulky, which made it awkward to wear underneath a cardigan or blazer.  I tried tying the sash to the side and it made the blouse fit oddly.  Going to return it."
3.0,"The lens wasn't the color I ordered, but returning them is too much of a hassle. The sunglasses feel cheap compared to my Oakley's but I wanted something I wouldn't feel bad about losing in the river or breaking playing soccer."
3.0,Product is very nice but only came with one boot
3.0,It’s really cute and good quality but the smell of the bag is rancid. Haven’t decided if i’m going to try and disinfect to get rid of the smell or return it.
3.0,Did not run true to size
3.0,"Material is thick and durable but plasticy-feeling. This is not going to look like a luxe or sophisticated suit but if you need to check the box that, ""yup, I'm wearing a suit,"" it'll get the job done. Cut is much wider leg than I guessed by the photo. It reminds me of a Larry Levine suit I once owned about 15 years ago.<br /><br />You may find better bang for your buck at Marshall's or looking for something wool and previously owned on Ebay.<br /><br />Again, though, it gets the job done, good for different seasons. This really, really feels like a uniform -- material is like flight attendant suits -- and I wouldn't be surprised if a uniform company makes it."
3.0,No me gusto la tela es muy mala calidad para el precio que tiene. el color es el mismo pero la calidad de la tela no se parece a la que muestran en la foto
3.0,To me they look much prettier in picture than in person.
3.0,"Not for me - good fit, but too &#34;pajama-y&#34; Prefer Jags."
3.0,"It's really cute, but even with the drawstring pulled tightly, it fits too loosely."
3.0,I am so bummed!! I love this watch band but it’s too big. My wrist measures around 6” (loosely) so I ordered an extra small band. The band I received is so big it goes half way up my forearm. I love this style and love this idea. I really wish it would have worked out.
3.0,love the look of these jeans but they do fit very snug for a size 12.
3.0,"I loved this dress but unfortunately I had to sew up the underarms on each side before I could wear it. It was as if someone had tried it on and hulked out of it. I needed for a party and didn’t have time to return it or I would have. I also hemmed it because I’m 5’3” and it was sitting on my knees which is not a good look for my height. I bought the dark green and it was great. I bought a large and before I had to sew the underarms it had room in the chest I’m a DD, it was snug after the fix. Order in time for an exchange just in case. I really did like it though, super cuter and got lots of compliments at the Christmas party."
3.0,"It's a nice bag, just wasn't the style I was looking for. Returning it because I purchased a different bag that I like a lot better."
3.0,Nice look but do not expect it to last long
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but it’s just not flattering on me. The color is a perfect navy, but the darts, or detail across the chest, just doesn’t look good on me. I ordered my regular size, medium and am 5’3, 140 lbs with an average bust."
3.0,This dress runs small.  Material is cheap.
3.0,"They do the job, but I'm not sure I'd purchase again. They're not user friendly for a European cut suit. If you wear the baggy Steve Harvey suits, then they'll work just fine."
3.0,"These boots were about two sizes too big when I ordered a half size smaller than my shoe size as suggested. Though they seem to be well made, the boot is also incredibly stiff and I was so put off that I wont be ordering the ""correct"" size pair."
3.0,I was very excited when I ordered this bag.This bag is very flimsy material.Its nice but definitely not as it seems by picture.
3.0,"I purchased this for me however it was hard to see the rhinestones, very small not what I was expecting.  Good for my young grand daughter as a stocking stuffer."
3.0,The color is off..the top & bottom is more of a peach color not pink
3.0,In general product is ver good
3.0,"We love the color  (olive)but the sizing doesn't match the other shirts we have. Bought a XL, 17: 34/35. The sleeves are so short. Will make it work by rolling up the sleeves. The torso is on the tight side too but wearable. Not too happy. Purchase one size up.<br />UPDATE.....PURCHASED THE NEXT SIZE UP AND IT WAS GREAT"
3.0,They’re pretty good. But the pictures are a bit misleading. The knuckles are not the same as pictured. The elastic is a little bit loose as well. But overall does the trick and looks pretty good!
3.0,Will be returning unfortunately. They were too big and they don't taper at the bottom like traditional biker shorts. Loved the color and the tie-dye pattern though. Wish they fit better!
3.0,Size  runs  small
3.0,"Perfect size for me.  Lots of pockets.  No more worrying about things falling out when I'm looking for something or zippers breaking cause I am trying to fit too many things.  Fits all my stuff and waters for the day with room to spare.<br /><br />Update: One zipper is already broken...had this issue with smaller bags and attributed the issue to being too many things stuffed in the bag.  This one is way more space than I need, so I know this is not the cause.  Disappointing."
3.0,Didn’t realize that there were three hooks in the back. Was hoping for two like the others I purchased. A little too confining for me.
3.0,i like the dress! great material but the front isnt as open as in the picture and i have big boobs.. i will have to make it work!
3.0,"Adorable, but the inner bra was way too small"
3.0,So I think I can get this to look like the pictures however I was surprised at how flimsy it actually is. It is a row of feathers sewed into a black ribbon that is all. I'll likely have to fortify it with some additional fabric or foam to get it written enough to likely withstand a Halloween party.
3.0,I love the necklaces and got them for me and my friend but the chain is easily breakable so o would recommend changing it out with something sturdier.
3.0,"I ordered XL so my husband could wear it with heavy socks, but it is too big. He is only size 8-9.  Husband didn't want to return it. Says it is okay."
3.0,I gave this dress 3 stars due to the fabric. It’s a cheap looking and feeling fabric. I got it in red and white. It did not occur to me how much like a candy cane I would look. It does fit well and did not shrink in washer and dryer.
3.0,"The seller advertised two different 2-tie sets so I ordered them both and can now compare. These are good inexpensive ties of average quality. The tag attached to each tie says they are 100% polyester (so know that if you are buying them as a gift).<br /><br />One 2-tie set I received contained two identical ties, but the product description says “Mixed Set 2 Pack; two different styles tie combinations”.<br /><br />The second 2-tie set I ordered contained one striped tie and the second tie was the same as the two identical ones in my first boxed set—so now I have 3 identical ties out of 4!<br /><br />The striped tie is blue, black, white and purple. My husband says this one is his favorite out of booths sets of ties. The other tie in this set, which is the same as the 2 identical ties I received in the first set—so now I have 3 of the same—has little purple, blue and white diamond shapes. A good color and pattern—but not for now 3 identical ties. The product description should clearly say that you’re getting two “grab bag”, mystery, or “you take a chance” ties. And that they could be two of the same tie. You are not getting exactly what is in the product description photo.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product “free” (except for paying income taxes on the value) in order to provide my feedback on this item. But I rate honestly and try my best to be descriptive to help others choose their purchases in an informed way. My rating was not influenced by anyone. If my rating or photos were helpful to you, please click helpful."
3.0,I don’t like how cheap / fake the product looks.
3.0,"Looks good but the embroidery is not real, I had to use me sewing machine to kind of attach the flowers better."
3.0,"This zip-up could have been a hit had it not been cut so large. I ordered an XS, so there was no XXS for an exchange. The color is great and it was comfortable, but cut too generously."
3.0,While the product looks good. Was way too small .<br />Have to order at least 2 size more.<br />I have different kind waist training and this was the smallest.<br />Size is off
3.0,"Interesting kit for a common cap problem - flat brims. Nice that the kit came with an adult- and a child-size shaper tool. Aside from the molds, there are no addtl guides on how best to use (eg. how long to use, whether to aid using steam). Seems simple enough to apply but I'm unsure how effective this is compared to simply curving and folding the curved brim into the hat, which is what I've been doing. As you can tell from the photo, my method was able to curve the brim wo any extra jig. Overall, I gave it 3 stars because I think there are other hats where I can see this working; for me, I likely won't need it since my current, no-cost version works just fine."
3.0,Not good on a petite person.
3.0,Material isn’t very breathable... very “faux satinish”... she liked it as a filler present
3.0,It is a cute bracelet but it got worn out pretty fast and the shipping time took longer than expected.
3.0,Not the best fit. A little tight around the waist and not the softest or best stretch but I’ll use them.
3.0,"Order a size up. Kinda short but if u dont raise your hands, then you'll be good lol"
3.0,"Love Nike, but these tops are VERY thin!  If you want a thin top, this would work fine.  It is see through if you get red or white."
3.0,"Had to return, too big."
3.0,"Thinner than expected, but nice product"
3.0,"Top was way big, bottoms fit...had to send it back."
3.0,It's a nice dress. Not super thrilled... can dress it up or down. I followed the chart and my dress is a size or 2 too big. Better too big than too small. I can go down on the size when I order a different color since they are fairly cheap.
3.0,Bought it for the husband his comment was &#34;Boy that's a bit big.&#34; I don't think he's thrilled.
3.0,"I did not expect that it has no second hand.  Though now I see the picture did not show one.  I just never expected an analog watch not to have a second hand. I think this ought to be pointed out in the text.  Also the watch should be shown in profile on a wrist so you can judge how slim or not it is.  It does appear slim in the profile shown but the back part projects the watch up a bit, which is not a problem.  Watch band is good and would be reusable on other watches."
3.0,"Doesn't really look like the photo, and i have the body in the photo. The elastic is much higher, so its kind of boxy. Maybe better on a petite person.  I'm 5 ft 9. Not exactly ugly, but not quite flattering either. Now I have no bust, so a more generous bust may balance this out. It is nice fabric, and true to color etc... It's not worth returning, but I wouldn't wear it on a date like I planned, but probably to work on a day a feel bloated. I purchased XS and it was still a bit baggy. I'm a size 2 at 115lbs. Hope this helps."
3.0,These run small compared to others we own.
3.0,"This seems to be a nice US ARMY hat but when i tried to rip the MADE IN CHINA tag from the inside the head band i pulled the threads loose, now i need to sew it back before Fathers Day."
3.0,These bracelets are good for the price but dont take long for the finish to wear off.
3.0,Good but the moon thing and the blue diamond keep getting stuck with each other and with the bracelet itself
3.0,"The pictures on Amazon's sale page showed a adjustable cord strap, which is one of the reasons I bought this one.  However, the hat did not come with it."
3.0,"I am 5'6 and it swallows me, come down way past my knees."
3.0,They are very cute but so big. I normally wear a 13/14 in juniors. And 10 or 12 in misses. The large is huge on me. Probably could have gotten a small /medium for a snug fit. I am 5'4 and the length is perfect
3.0,"Not bad at all,just a little big<br />."
3.0,The gloves are adorable and warm. However a hole appeared between my thumb and pointer finger after about 2 weeks of light use. Disappointing.
3.0,"This thing is HUGE. I'm 5'4 and 115lbs and this looks like it's made for a very large person. I returned it due to the size. The quality was not bad, it felt like it was made well..."
3.0,Material and it’s fit
3.0,It was to short and not as bright as it looks on display. Dissappointed
3.0,"When I received the shirt I was very happy with it. I usually wear a medium or a large and went with the large so it would be flowy and have longer length because I am tall (5'8"") with a long torso. Initially it fit just as I wanted. I washed it and noticed right away when I took it out of the dryer that it appeared smaller, and sure enough when I tried it on, it had shrunk. I can still wear it, maybe, but it's a bit shorter than I like and not as loose. I shouldn't have put it in the dryer, so be warned, if you love the fit when you get it, hang it to dry."
3.0,It would be super cute if both sides were the same shade of blue but the other side is a solid mismatching shade of blue. It is also smaller than depicted.
3.0,"Comfortable but the leg holes were loose.  I ordered a 14-16, the packaging indicated it was a 2XL.  Other than poor fit/sizing, the material was nice."
3.0,Material does not feel like a typical pair of athletic shorts. More like the slick adidas jump suite material.
3.0,"I was very excited for this bathing suit. It looks cute and would be perfect for the summer. When it arrived for some reason it was soaking wet. Not sure if the package got wet during delivery or what. So I had to wait until dry to try it on. I am 5'4&#34; wear about a size 2-4 and so I ordered the small/medium. The bottom fits perfectly, unfortunately for me the top does not cover the girls. I am a C. That is usually why I like the idea of buying separates so you can mix and match the sizes. If the top fit I would give this a 5 because it is a very cute and well made bathing suit.. it just doesn't fit this gal. I did receive a discount in exchange for my  honest review."
3.0,"fell apart after a few weeks.  Ain't the glasses in toto, carried them in my satchel.  but still, lenses were really cheap."
3.0,"Cute tee, but the one I recieved had too many holes in it - it looks like it went through a lawn mower. Also, the material is rough and stiff. I didn't want to pay to send it back to China, so I'm stuck with it."
3.0,Could have been better but good for the price its just for a halloween costume
3.0,"Great for what I needed it for- one long international trip. Has a place for everything and holds quite a bit. Not the best product if you plan to use it for trips over the long run, it started looking and feeling cheap after a month of us."
3.0,When I saw the customer images and saw that it was made in the USA I jumped on it. I love buying made in America items. I gladly paid the 31 dollars. When I received my band I got the made in China crap. I could have brought a cheap Timex band half the price with the same quality. I think Amazon should take down those customer images pics. Too much like a bait and switch?
3.0,They work great! but cheap materiel.
3.0,The colors are not vivid and the back is stamped “Phillipines”! Very disappointed Even the veining is not real. They have artificially put metal striating on the stones
3.0,"Attractive, smaller size fits kid just fine.  Clasp comes open pretty easily though."
3.0,"They look great, but the chain breaks very easily - this has happened to 3 of the 4 I have worn so far. I know can't complain much because the price is good, but it is still frustrating."
3.0,This is VERY stretchy fabric. It will cling to all the lumps you don't like. I wish I was a little thinner. It was a very cute dress. I am 5'2 and 180lbs and it was just not looking right at all 😂
3.0,I got a 4t one for my 3year old  and it was good all around except it was a little tight under the arms
3.0,They sent me the wrong size but other than that the shirt looks exactly like the picture. But will not order again!
3.0,"I purchased these because they are described as ""knee high"" length....they fit just fine on my foot and around my calf, but only come up to my mid calf, a good 6-7 inches shy of just below or at my knee as expected.  Otherwise a decent sock, but I would not purchase unless you are looking for a boot or crew length.  I am a woman with a size 8.5-9 shoe and am 5 ft 5 inches tall, my calves are of average width IMO."
3.0,The earrings themselves are very nice but the cushion on the back came off immediately and I can't wear them without the cushion.
3.0,These aren't bell bottoms these are boot cut...which was extremely disappointing...but the fit was good just wasn't a bell bottom.
3.0,too small but beautiful.
3.0,I can wear this but  not often.
3.0,Not the best the latch gets stuck when you move it up and down and it’s not like you can put the whole thing back in the box and return it
3.0,Fits but a little tight in the belly area..nice shirt thou!
3.0,"I purchased this as a gift for my cousin and although it was packaged in a plastic bag, the eye mask was clearly stained and did not look clean/new. Im not sure how I feel gifting this now because of the stain and might have to take it apart to wash separately and put back as I don't have time to find/purchase something else. I'm not sure why this is as it was packaged in a plastic bag with the poly bag as the packaging but yeah. My rating is mostly in part of the inconvenience of having to go through that."
3.0,"Order arrived and the tag says Shein not Romwe. Shirt is a thicker stretchy cotton material which is nice. However, ruffles are only on one side if you look closely in the picture. It’s more like a T-shirt. Not as dressy as I’d hoped but it fits and tucks in nice."
3.0,"Decent quality for the price,  no where near VS as others posted but neither is the price! 36dd comes with 3 claps.  Item arrived with a strap cut,  very strange,  waiting for seller response."
3.0,Nice as a purse. I found this under work bag and it is too small for a workbag
3.0,Maybe because of the extra stretchy fabric these feel like they run large. Very pretty colors.
3.0,It had good cut but the embroidery was not cotton and was plastic that i did not expected but i will keep it for my garden clothes
3.0,"It’s not silk. Feels nothing like silk and does not pass the burn test, the thread completely melted like plastic. It’s pretty though."
3.0,Skirt was not straight but more a line. Ran very large
3.0,I wear medium in most styles but this is a bit big. The sleeve is longer. So this purchase was disappointing. I gave it to my daughter who also wears medium but she is taller and it fit her perfectly
3.0,"Top a little big, bottoms fit her good, the skirt/tail a tad bit tight."
3.0,I like the idea of this skirt.  The material isnt the best if you look at it closely but it's volume masks it.  I ordered a 4 and it was too small.
3.0,"My son loves Doge and was excited to get this, it does have kind of a chemical smell"
3.0,It fits but the inside of the headband bleeds when the wearer sweats.
3.0,"They are hard to store, also aren’t super flattering on bigger boobs because of how tiny the cups are."
3.0,"Excellent quality, thick and stretchy, but it was not long enough from the crotch to shoulders. My daughter had a long torso, but not abnormally long. She’s 12 and 5’ 1/2”, thin, and the size 12-14 did not fit her length wise and was just snug enough. Bubbled in the back space from her bum to back. I really wanted it to work out."
3.0,"It's smaller than expected, and shipped... in a plastic baggie... inside of a crushable envelope. Brighton deserves at least a box for protection as well as presentation. Seller could do a better job of customer service."
3.0,They are not like the pictures it is shorter then it shows in the picture
3.0,THE BACK OF THIS EARRING DO NOT STAY SNAPPED TOGETHER TO KEEP THE EARRING IN YOUR EAR.
3.0,Throughout the day you will find yourself tightening the band as it loosens easily
3.0,The bottoms were very very small for a large...top pretty true to size chart
3.0,"I was so excited when I got this coat for Christmas!  The zipper kept splitting at the bottom only for me to realize there was no metal piece at the end of the zipper to keep it together.  I got it as a gift, I hope the seller allows me to exchange it."
3.0,I just got these today the barbell seems to be very small then normal. They are cute though may have to get use to the awkward shape though.
3.0,"Just received jacket and it ran small had to up it to a large.. I am 5 8"" 137LBS. can t comment on anything else yet"
3.0,"There's a lope attached to the tail, you need to provide something to string through the loop"
3.0,It'll work for now. I was hoping for a thicker belt. It'll do for now.
3.0,A little bit awkward in terms of sizing. The cinch wasn't really shaped like a cinched waist - it looked more like a tube - and the straps were a bit too long.
3.0,"Not as big as I need,"
3.0,So these are very soft but the material is definitely not for working out in.  It feels very heavy and wasnt quite what I was hoping for..
3.0,"The dress is adorable. However, the fabric is cheaper feeling than I had expected. Was planning on returning and missed the return window. My girls use it for dress up now."
3.0,I’m concerned about the  Quality of the shoes but I guess for 89 bucks I can’t  expect much.  The shoes I buy from amazon don’t last long before something is breaking.
3.0,Sizes run small.  Go up one size.
3.0,"I first purchased this because I am being forced to go back to in- person work. So, I immediately decided to get clothes that were very comfortable that I could wear under the lab coat while at work. I was so disappointed with the way the pants fit. The top is definitely more flattering.I just wished the pants fit better. I wanted to purchase multiple colors. My only concern is if I go up a size, the top wouldn’t fit the same."
3.0,Thin material. Great for summer. I just wish the back of the dress was as long as the front.
3.0,Runs small order a size up. Other than that looks and feels like good quality for the price
3.0,"it came with a small hole in the back, sorry wont buy this product again and I bought 4 and only the gray one was damaged"
3.0,Beautiful color but the material is not what I was expecting. After I washed it the wrinkles didn’t disappear
3.0,Ok... average pair of shorts. Quick drying light material. Keys in pocket hang below leg hem... looks kinda wired.
3.0,"Didn't feel enough compression as it should, especially in the foot area.<br />The bottom sole is slippery, wouldn't recommend for running"
3.0,Pro: sit fits well and quality of the material seems good.<br />Con: it looks cheap. The picture quality of the mermaid print doesn’t look good.
3.0,"These pants run a little small and leaves little to no room for adjustments. I suggest ordering a size larger than what you may usually wear. Its also more of a sheer material, meaning you could see your undergarments underneath. if that does not bother you then you should be fine. love the design and print however, I cant wear them because they are to small."
3.0,"I will explain why I can’t give these 5 stars. This is my second pair. I love hear glasses more than my more expensive ones. They are show stoppers! I get complimented all the time! I got my first pair last Christmas. About 3 weeks ago, the ear piece on the side completely broke away from the frame and could not be repaired. They no longer sell them where I originally purchased them and I can live without them so I was lucky enough to find them here on amazon! (Even Le Specs don’t sell these anymore.) I don’t care that they broke before and may break again. I love them!!! I would give them 5 stars but they did break. So you should be aware that they may not stand he test of time like other diesginer brands. Get them if you don’t care because they are HOT!"
3.0,This dress runs small.  I had all of my nieces try it on that are  considered small and they found it to be to tight all over. Order a size up or  two.
3.0,"Height:  5'4&#34;<br />Weight:  180 LB (big in the hips and thighs)<br />Waist:  33.5<br />Bra:  36DD<br /><br />Size purchased: XXL, fit well and I am typically a size XL, 12/14.<br /><br />I didn't like the material it was made out of.  Quality was not good, but was fair for the price point of under $30.  The sheen of the fabric gave it a costume type feel.  The cut was flattering on me, cute and feminine.  I returned, but would purchase in the future for costuming purposes."
3.0,"Very pretty but the stones fell out very easily,"
3.0,"I love the band. It's sparkly, gorgeous and flatters with the silver watch. Unfortunately, it has fallen off three times in the last 2 weeks...I'm careful when I put it on, but it's risky to wear!"
3.0,Super cute and comfortable but way too long for a 5’ tall person.
3.0,"I'm 5'2&#34;, 143lbs. and I ordered a medium. That is what I gathered to be the correct size attempt from other reviews. However TOO Small. The top fits my 12 yr old daughter 4'11&#34;, about 100lb, and the bottoms are like a small women's. - too big for her, but too small for me. Just heads up order larger.<br />Quality seems fine, and colors are brilliant. Super cute in person, wish it'd have fit me."
3.0,"Asian 2 = US 12-14. My size is 14, I am 1.72 mts tall and fit perfectly.  If you are a shorter person will look extrange.  I wouldn't buy it again because you can tan nicely due to the frame."
3.0,"I'm 5'5"", 105lbs, and I ordered XSmall. I was surprised that this shirt is actually a bit too small.  If anything, shirts are usually too large if they don't fit.  The overall fit wasn't terrible.  It was a bit tighter than I prefer, but would have been ok if it doesn't shrink any.  It was also a tad shorter than I prefer, but tolerable if it didn't shrink any.  The biggest issue I had was the shoulder/armpit area.  The sleeves were pretty tight in my underarm, and the sleeve seams didn't come out far enough on my shoulders.  The shirt is very thin/lightweight, which would be great when it's hot out.  It seemed fairly opaque considering the thinness of the material.  The fabric wasn't stiff, but it wasn't very stretchy either.  It didn't seem like it would be the most durable, but since I haven't put it to the test, I can't say that for sure- just a guess on my part.  I returned the shirt.  They did not have any other sizes when I started my return, so I did not reorder."
3.0,The material of these shirts are VERY soft! My only complaint is that they are a little see through and I can't hide my belly :/ otherwise I love them
3.0,"They are pretty, but heavy and bend my ear lobes."
3.0,These run very small. Order 2 sizes up. Quality is OK.
3.0,It is too small but it will do.
3.0,How do you call those plastic tips where the glasses meet your nose? Those broke off. Glasses lasted for one summer
3.0,"Didn't fit well, was not flattering on my<br />Body."
3.0,I don't like the fabric. Outfit looks like the picture.
3.0,My husband is bald so we are just going to paint his head white instead but yeah definitely left the hat out of the package!
3.0,"These shades are nice and great color, but they have large spots on them, which is not pictured. I am disappointed."
3.0,"Super cute dress, great as a casual summer item. Comfortable material, but the fit was just not flattering on me. I felt like the medium was too big, but the small prob wouldn't fit at all."
3.0,These were great for when I had my mastectomy.  My disappointment came after washing the pjs.  They fabric started to pill.  They feel great on but they do not look so good after a few washes.
3.0,Cute but there was a seam not sewn completely together.
3.0,It's pretty but it feels a little.... flimsy. It wobbles when you open it. Not as heavy as I was expecting.
3.0,"Shoe fits okay, a little too big but by the time I had to use them for their purpose it was too late to send them back."
3.0,The product is great for its price I am a 38dd and it hold great. I wore it to a wedding where I dance for hours and it stay out all night. I will say the only downside is that it does not come with instructions so the perfect fit come with trial and error.
3.0,"Very narrow width, dig into the side of my head."
3.0,One of the bracelets broke the first day we had it...But the other ones are still good
3.0,"I wanted to love it, and will probably buy from them again. The material is thick and warm and it should flow well. It's just so long that its a good two inches longer than I am and drags on the floor. It is also holds a lot of static and seems to attract all the small dirt specks in the house. I didn't think that cotton did that, so I'm not sure why that is happening. I an going to have to decide whether to return it or serge the hem and sew it up."
3.0,"Cute top, material is kind of thin and it seemed to run a bit small on me but overall cute and comfortable!"
3.0,Unsure why the price varies from size to size but the fabric is not worth it. Ordered this back in the beginning of December and there was no activity for 15 days until I contacted the seller for a refund/return. It wasn’t until I contacted Amazon about my refund that the package appeared to be moving in the physical sense and actually a package. It was too much of a hassle for what it actually consisted of. The graphics are not as intense as the photo so that photo is definitely enhanced.<br />My son loves it but has to wear a shirt under it since the fabric is itchy on the inside.
3.0,The white soles make your foot look larger.
3.0,"Cute bag, but too small."
3.0,"I've returned my medium for a large. Ordered a medium based on the size chart but in reality, should of ordered large. In general, the color and design are true to the picture. A great light weight and stylish trench coat. Still waiting for the large to arrive so when I receive it I can let you know if it fits better! Downfall is having to pay shipping on returns :("
3.0,Pretty but runs super small
3.0,2X was more like a XL
3.0,Size up these run small
3.0,"I love this wallet.  It's very soft, had plenty of room for my stuff.  And it's supposed to block those devices that steal your credit card info.<br /><br />Im adding to my previous review.  I noticed a couple months after I got it my cards where coming out of their slot with black stuff in them.  Turns out the slots are coming apart and getting on my cards.  Not coming off the cards easily either.  The wallet is also bending my cards.  So I’m amending my 5-star rating to a 3."
3.0,"Nice quality, but they happen to be too small. I'm an exact size 12 and my heels come right to the edge of the padding. The problem is, after you take two steps, your feet work their way out of them and your heel ends up on the ridge at the back of the slipper. I would say that a size 11-12 is more suitable for someone with a size 10-10.5 foot. Return in process."
3.0,On the wood floor these aren't very non-slip
3.0,They’re not as soft as I expected cotton to feel.
3.0,Cute dress but runs a little large. I got the smallest size and it was still to big but worked for what I needed it for. Wish it came with a brown belt/cord or something
3.0,I know Chantelle bras are nice but this definitely fit smaller in the cup than my other 32G bras from Chantelle
3.0,More like pleather  and not real leather.
3.0,Very cheaply made. But for kiddos to play pretend with it does the trick.
3.0,"Material is very thin and smooth. Fits like a glove. I ordered this for Halloween , but didn’t realize it was going to take 2wks to ship from somewhere in China. This dress will show every curve. Overall it’s not bad for the price."
3.0,Just wish I knew it was so big. I would of ordered size bigger and wore on another finger. Is beautiful ring.
3.0,"The band seems like a good product.  It feels very solid.  The band adapter on the other hand was somewhat hard to put on.  One side was difficult to lock into place and whenever I would wiggle it, it would fall off.  After a while it finally stayed in place and seems pretty solid."
3.0,Under skirt should be fluffy
3.0,It would be nice to be able to choose separate sizes for the top and bottom. The pads in the top are funky. But it's a pretty good product considering price! :)
3.0,"I can't wear them.  I ordered expecting a woman's plus size, but definitely is NOT that.  Don't order these in ANY size unless you have no thighs, no butt and no belly.  Skinny girls only, please ... AGAIN."
3.0,warm  but come off
3.0,I may have just overlooked the details of this sale but was expecting three bonnets not one.  It is super cute and has stood up to many hours of dress up play.  I would recommend these but just be aware that it is one and not three.
3.0,I wasnt overly impressed with the fit of this bathing suit. It seemed to run small in size and if you are well endowed in the chest area there is barely any coverage whatsoever
3.0,"Much shorter than pictured in the front. Maybe that's  because I've got protrusions in the upper torso region, but well within the normal range, so it's unlikely that the cause is anatomical. I am not particularly tall either, so the peep-show isn't weight-related.  In the end, I donated it, because it looked foolish with a shirt underneath."
3.0,A lot smaller than it looked Smalls for a child It didn’t say that
3.0,"It looks cute, but the reviews didn't pan out for me. Most said to order your regular size, which I did. I wear a M to L. I ordered a L. This is TOO small. I couldn't even get it over my shoulders. Unfortunately, the XL is out of stock on the color I want, so no exchange for me. Just a basic return. If you do get this, I'd recommend that you order one to two sizes up unless you are really narrow in the arms/shoulders. Also, the material on this is very thin, so I'm guessing the shirt won't hold up for long."
3.0,Runs very small had to buy 2 sizes bigger than size stated on measurements for my 12 year old competitive swimmer. Nice suit once we figured out right size. Good quality for price. Would buy again.
3.0,Very Pretty but Very Small
3.0,I liked these very much. I do lose them though and have had to buy them a couple of times.<br />It's the curse of the clip earrings.
3.0,Bigger Than I  thought
3.0,"Feels more like nylon than cotton.  My feet get more hot in these than when I wear a regular, even thicker, cotton sock. Nice socks but I wish it had more of a cotton feel."
3.0,"This product really deserves 2 stars, because it is nearly impossible to get the backing off, but I will give it 3 as long as you follow my advice.  Do not attempt to peel the backing,`what you need to do is get a nail file and file the backing down for a few seconds until it is no longer glossy and smooth, but has a little bit of texture to it, then use a stick of slow-drying light-hold glue, or double-sided tape between the roughened backing and the hat or hatband.  With double-sided gorilla tape you really don't even need to bother with the nail file.<br /><br />You are welcome."
3.0,I'm pretty small. But this was kind of tight at the bottom. In the picture it looks longer and looser and possibly thicker..as I was hoping it would be. But it was thin and shorter in And tight at the bottom. It's still a super cute shirt. And I'll continue wearing it. But just sad it wasn't what I was hoping for.
3.0,Cool for a teenager not an adult woman. But my girl loved it. She prefers dainty(thin/minuscule) jewelry. It’s cute! Wish there were dimensions advertised w/ it. I would not have purchased it had I known it was sooooo small.
3.0,"This is beautiful, however, it catches on everything...my pants, my blouses, sometimes, even my bed sheets.  I learned quickly to be very careful when I have it in!"
3.0,Run very short! Size 6-7 is more like 4 at best. Very disappointed because quality and style looks great!
3.0,"Very, Very Nice Dress.  I purchased a 4x my normal size is a 2x  and this dress fits as if it was a 1x."
3.0,"These come in handy, depending on what you need with your shoes. Some of them would be more helpful if there more descriptions for their uses added to the product. I would definitely use for relieving slight issues with ill-fitting shoes (maybe using the strap circles to help keep a shoe from flapping loose, using one of the circle cushions to relieve a pain point over the top of your toes or foot, etc), but if you need something to help make a shoe fit better, this might not be what you're looking for."
3.0,"I love the material of this dress, and the length and fit were great EXCEPT in the hips. This is one of those dresses where they create the hips for you - totally unnecessary given the stretchable fabric - which means that slimmer women like me look ridiculous in it. I could have probably pulled it off, but it definitely didn't leave me feeling as pretty as I'd hope because of that feature, so I don't recommend it for slimmer women."
3.0,"Great quality but yet another ring that is supposed to be a 2g comes in as a 4g. keeping it  because it has a smaller diameter that might be helpful in some situations, but I guess I just need to go to an actual store to find a 2g as online shopping gas not been successful."
3.0,I loved the shirt when it came in. Very flattering but I only wore it 3 times and the seams at the bottom of the shirt began to come apart. Really upset I didn’t get much use out of it before it fell apart.
3.0,"Reading the other reviews, I was hesitant to buy this set due to some reports of missing pieces. Luckily, all pieces were inside the box. The one gripe I can confirm is that the loops are much too small for the chains to fit through.  The 2 pins look great on a black hat as pictured."
3.0,"32DD and wearing a size L. fits me fine, but the fabric is on the thin side which makes the padding visible through the lime green fabric. not the greatest padding either, as they feel somewhat stiff. when I took the padding out, you could totally see my nipple. perhaps a black color top would be better. nevertheless, it fits good and is a basic triangle top. in my opinion, for the quality, it's bit pricey at $19.95."
3.0,Dress was too revealing.
3.0,Lace trim in not cotton
3.0,"Feels super sexy to wear, very flattering for all body types. Shows skin in all the right places. The torso area is very, very billowy, a bit bigger than expected (see how the model's arms are down? thats cause there is a ton of material there) and it needed a belt or something, but I still love it. Oh, downside, one side seam was sewn twisted & bumpy so I have to iron the dress every time I want to wear it."
3.0,"Sad. I was so excited for this cute romper, but it was about 3” too short for my 5’9” height. Quality was good for the price, I’m really disappointed it didn’t work out. 😞"
3.0,"Will keep it, but was disappointed in the color. It isn’t nearly as bright or pretty as in the listing. Very soft though."
3.0,"not what I expected, a little smaller, but it will work. its cute"
3.0,"This is a cute purse and looks like the picture. However, it takes quite awhile to ship from China, so be aware of that (6-8 weeks). Also, it is pretty flimsy, construction-wise. If you hold it by the blue handle, it collapses in the middle. If you hold it by the shoulder strap, it tips heavily forward because the hardware is so low on the sides. I can tell that this purse will not last very long, but it's too much trouble to send back, so I will make it work. I actually sewed a chopstick on the inside of the blue flap to give it some structure so I could carry it by the handle. I'll enjoy it while it lasts."
3.0,I love the color and the bathing suit.  the only thing is the elastic around the top and bottom twists and then makes the suit look twisted.
3.0,Very low quality! This does not look as nice as on the picture. Dull colors and white on the inside. Not what I expected!
3.0,It's rides up with movement
3.0,"Very thin shoe, shoes was made kinda big, great for pool, not so good for beach or Rocky surface"
3.0,These should say they are for kids they were way to small for me
3.0,"When you breathe in, the fabric comes with it. But the drawstring is a nice feature."
3.0,"It's that weird cheeply made copper nickel, don't buy unless you have some way to coat it because that green ring will start to happen after a while. Other than that it looks decent though, but you might be happier spending more money for a pewter one instead (like I did shortly after buying this)"
3.0,"The ear cut-outs are nice, but they keep the gaiter up too high. It irritates my lower eyelids."
3.0,"I liked the style and material; however, it's too big for everyday use.  It looks smaller in the picture on the site."
3.0,Didnt like the material. Not good quality. Thought it would be comfy but was not.
3.0,"I am a size C and the bras fit just right but removing the item is VERY painful. 1. If you start to sweat the item will most likely start falling off. 2. The &#34;nipple area&#34; inside the bra is the size of a grape. You will have to make it bigger if you have big areolas. 3. If you want to reuse the item you need to keep the plastic wrap over it. Other than that, the item is a great!"
3.0,The color was very cute and the material was nice but it fit extremely tight. I recommend ordering up a size.
3.0,Runs extremely small. Had to return.
3.0,Nice shorts just a bit smaller than other Zentrex XL shorts I have purchased.  Good quality
3.0,This is cute but smaller than it looks. If I didn't have a 15.00 off coupon I would have returned it. Not worth 35.00.<br />But 20.00 ok
3.0,"First one I bought fit beautifully! It was from the same seller and same size but black with white stripes. This color (white with black stripes) was wayyyy too big! Very unflattering. There are clearly some quality control issues here. Otherwise, great material and very fashionable!"
3.0,"Runs very small, order at least a size or 2 up. Swimsuit just as pictured, color the same as posted. I didn't even order for the triangle top they always run extremely small..I just really wanted to bottom and I almost ripped it trying it on...no stretch, made for one time use."
3.0,As the question stated.... YES they are light weight. Really breathable as well. They fit... per say... They fit on my waist just fine. My thigh area is good with compression..... But my cucumber and grapes.... they ain’t got no room. I would’ve liked if there was a bit more space in the crotch area for sure.
3.0,Cheap as in not well made. But okay to layer under another shirt.
3.0,"So I bought a size bigger as suggested. All 3 fit differently so you can tell that it was rushed being made possibly? one shirt fits as it should, one fits just a little tighter and smaller and one is definitely a smaller fit from the other 2, I will order again but order 2 sizes up as I would reccomend for anyone else"
3.0,This necklace and earrings set is pretty but the clasp on the necklace broke the second time it was worn.
3.0,To  short for shoulder length hair.
3.0,"The fabric is soft and the styling is good, but they tend to ride up on me somewhat. I don't dislike them overtly, but this will be my last purchase from Knocker."
3.0,I was disappointed with this purchase and its quality. I ordered the 2 pack and the half of the masks had glue all over them and were faded. They were for birthday goody bags and I had to dispose of 12 of the 24 masks. The seller really needs to ensure quality control.
3.0,Size 8 was a fine fit around the palm but fingers were too short and the wrist band part was loose. Feels cheaply crafted with quality material.
3.0,"The quality of the product is great and it looks great. Functionality is the only problem with this key cover. The clip is connected to the key by a screw clasp. There no way to disengage the physical key from the fob without having to remove the screw. I ended up cutting the cover on opposite ends of the top so the clasp doesn’t need to be unscrewed, but now the cover is loose."
3.0,These are really cute shoes however they were a little tight on my foot and ankle.
3.0,So far. It is a gift
3.0,"Beautiful Tourmaline, but the elastic itself is cheap and fraying."
3.0,"Love the owl, the chain was short for 18&#34; the size chain I always wear. The clasp also rips out my hair. I switched the owl to another chain and am happy with that and the price for this silver jewelry."
3.0,def. not a dress!! but made a nice shirt
3.0,"These were extremely cheap, so no surprise here... But yes, you do get what you pay for. These are cheap looking. And they feel cheaply made, the posts are super thick and the earring backs are really hard to get on and off, etc. But they are worth the price in my opinion-- the colors are pretty and bright, and they catch the light nicely. They're also a flattering size. It's nice to have them for hanging out at the pool, walking in the woods, etc. if I want a nice pop of color but also don't really care if they get lost."
3.0,The top fits perfect. The skirt was too small. Wish there was a way to order two different sizes.
3.0,color on computer did not reflect actual color had to send it back
3.0,"I love the Cami bra, but 2 of them was made irregular the straps are twisted.... Only way to fix its rip open and sew it again! You know I'm not doing that..."
3.0,I'm usually an XL with space. This is tight around my waist. Definitely order a size up
3.0,They looked cool and then the girls struggled to get them on.  They lack stretch and look obviously stretched out when worn.  BTW my girls are petite if you're wondering. So maybe add some more material or something. Just kinda sucks because we bought so many pairs.  😕
3.0,The size in these are completely wrong and did not fit even though in know for a fact my ring size
3.0,"Honestly I was a little disappointed with the item,the material is very thin"
3.0,OK.  Returned not what I expected.
3.0,a little large<br />I am 110 # 5'4
3.0,I always fit in 2xl stuff this is too small.
3.0,Very pretty top.  Great for work or going out paired with jeans.  But this to runs very large.  Make sure you order down a size
3.0,These are SO CUTE and I get so many compliments on them! But the gold piece has fallen out of four of the eight earrings. So I can no longer wear them which is very sad.
3.0,Good fit and love the pockets but the orange color is not as pictured. It is much brighter and not what I was expecting.
3.0,Cute boots however there is no zipper and the opening is narrow. I had to return them. The return process was easy and simple.
3.0,"Those glasses are nice and I love how they look. However, I went to replace the lenses in vision place but they said they can't. There is no screw for the lenses ro come out."
3.0,Looks nice.  Difficult to remove the pins to make the band smaller.
3.0,just do not like the way it fits.
3.0,"The owl is cute, but the chain is kind of cheap. The chain is also not adjustable so you have to like the shorter length."
3.0,Shoe is a lot larger ( fuller on inside ) for an infant
3.0,I’m satisfied with the durags but I’m highly upset at the size of the caps. They’re too big for my head and slide all around so they’re not useful.
3.0,"I've washed these capris once, maybe twice and they're already pilling between the thighs and along the stitching. Disappointed with that, and I expected better quality. I do like the hidden pocket in the waistband. Also, these fit a bit snug."
3.0,"The item arrived when stated, and the young man delivering it was very respectful when handing me the item, turning his head away from me when speaking. The mask is very small and is a more appropriate size for a petite person or child. The length is too short and the straps are absolutely NOT ADJUSTABLE which pulls my ears forward when looped around the back of them. I can probably work around that and extend them. I only intend to place this over a KN95 mask, as this item provides no real viral protection. This is the only vendor I've found to produce a mask with this particular print, which I love. All in all, whatever I need to do to make the mask workable is worth it to me."
3.0,Very small and cheaply made. Cute for a child.
3.0,"I returned this dress due to it being somewhat too snug. I'm 5'3&#34;, 119lbs with an athletic build and bought the Small. The fabric seems thin in some parts so it makes it feel a bit cheap. I wanted to like this dress but am returning it."
3.0,Fit great but material not to strong.  The seat of the pants being to wear immediately after the 1st time wearing them.  Mainly wearing at the seam.
3.0,The buckles on the sleeves are heavy & make noise when I move my arms but the shirt is pretty.
3.0,Just what we were looking for but the crotchless area is cut way too much.
3.0,tarnished pretty quickly. I do a lot of housework... so it didn't hold up well.
3.0,"Like other reviewers said, the “black” stripes are undoubtedly navy blue. Good shirts if you don’t care about the color."
3.0,"I really loved this mask! It came within good shipping time and was packaged fairly well. My only grievance is that some of the sparkles/gem sequins were missing and that's a bit annoying. Other than that, I was pleased."
3.0,the metal piece that attaches the hand strap is broken and it didn't have the dangily piece it's also smaller than I thought very disappointed hopefully I will not have trouble sending it back being there was no receipt with it.  My husband was able to figure out that the handle piece screws into the inside of the purse.  Reading other reviews I found that the signature dangily piece was inside one of the compartments b so the 3 is for having to fix the handle and its smaller than I thought otherwise I like it
3.0,The shirt was not the color that was advertised and the quality is very cheap.
3.0,"This looks of these glasses would be ""ok"" from a fashion standpoint, if it weren't for the cheap-plastic looking lenses. Really plastic looking."
3.0,"Very thin and frail material, feels a bit cheap"
3.0,I got an xl I'm 5'7 205 lbs. I was so excited for this outfit to get here and sadly the pant legs were way too long even with heels. Sending it back for a refund
3.0,These gloves are very comfortable other then that they were not that great. Kept hands warm downt to about 38 degrees. Not much good to say about the material either.
3.0,"I didn't expect a garment that looked expensive, so it was a good quality item for the price. The sizing is not accurate. It is very small. There is no room for large breasts, and the cut of the dress/ top has no darting to create the shape required for women with curves. Cute, but will be given to a friend."
3.0,"Sending back.  the netting inside, doesn't expand well."
3.0,"I am 5'4&#34; , 165lb and I guess under armour runs a little small. The XL was somewhat tight in the shoulders."
3.0,"This dress is cute.... BUUUUUT<br />WAY TOO SHORT!!<br />I am 126 pounds and 5’4 i got a small and it fits, but barley covers my behind."
3.0,I wanted to use these for small splits and chunks of wood. These are a little to light for that purpose. I think for produce they would be just fine.
3.0,"The look and quality of the cufflink and shirt studs was excellent. Unfortunately, my husband couldn't wear them with his tuxedo b/c the set only contained 4 shirt studs and my husband was not wearing a cummerbund. I mean, who wears cummerbunds anymore anyway?"
3.0,Smaller and not the quality I expected.
3.0,the material isn't as nice as I had hoped and it runs a bit big on me.  I ordered the large and I shoulda got the medium.  Ordered black and white and I still wear both even though they are a bit too big.  The black one is my favorite of the two.
3.0,Love the design. Not so much for how thin they were.
3.0,Didn’t like the light.  Can’t see time in the middle of night.  My last watch same brand had a light that was great.  I should have returned but didn’t .  Big mistake.  My old watch still works so I am going to switch bands and use it.  I would not buy again
3.0,Liked the style but the glasses did not come with cushioning on the earpiece.  It's only the wire on the sides so not really comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
3.0,"Decent fit, good texture, good silicone backing... but they still won't stay on my feet."
3.0,One of the stones was missing. So that's why I didn't give it a 5 stars..
3.0,The glasses do the job but one of the earpieces fell off after only two wearings.
3.0,The wallet itself looks nice and is pretty spacious. The only frustrating thing is that it's hard to snap close.
3.0,"The t-shirts is good, but the bib is not so much. The gel protect part in bib is not on good position and the straps is so long."
3.0,"Very beautiful, nice colour. Super compact, nice for going out at night with just a few items. The downside is the lack of zipper, so your things easily fall out."
3.0,"It's alright, just needed something for a family party. Had to see up a bag for the presents though because this didn't come with one."
3.0,"The dress is very nice but the size was not what was stated. The dress had the correct size in the package and on the dress, but it was 2 sizes too small."
3.0,It didn't fit. I put in a size 13 and it wasn't a size 13.
3.0,"I got this for my iwatch series 5 and I would say the color is really nice. It is comfortable and easy to install. The materials is a little bit elastic especially on the loop area unlike the original band that you can purchase with the original iwatch which is more tougher and won't easily break. When it comes to value for your money, since this is a cheaper band then you get what you will pay for it."
3.0,Average for boots.
3.0,The earrings are not stamped with the 925 silver marking. The are extremely light weigh even the stone. I was disappointed. I will not be wearing these.
3.0,I was given a different pattern than I ordered and because I received it right before the event I bought it for I did not return it. At least the pattern they sent was my 2nd choice. Make sure to read the reviews. It does run a little small so I ordered a size larger and it fit well. It's a little short but I received so many compliments on this dress.
3.0,First I will start off with the proud of this particular swimsuit. The swimsuit was very true to color. I ordered the swimsuit in the purple which was very deep and vibrant. The green part at the bottom was detailed and the scales were metalic. The swim suit slipped on easy and tied in the back.<br /><br />Now for the con's: the swim suit has no true form so it isn't flattering at least not to my body. There is absolutely no support in bust. One of the most shocking things was that it actually has what looks like shoulder pads in the breast area. Not only is that flaw a let down but on top of that the pads shift which I can only imagine is horrible while swimming. This isn't something that I would normally purchase for myself I'm a plus sized diva that lives in a bikini with great support and structure that hugs all of my amazing curves just right. However that type of swim wear usually cost over $100 dollars. If you are looking for a themed suit and your not that concerned with fit and you are strapped for cash then this suit will work out just fine for you so give it a try.<br /><br />Note: I was given this suit at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
3.0,"This is an adorable hat. However, this XS would fit only to a newborn baby for 1-2 months and the color is quite off, light orange instead of mustard yellow like shown in the picture."
3.0,"I am a woman wearing a size 6 med shoe. The smallest size offered was too large. Also, i found them to be too heavy to wear in warmer weather."
3.0,I like the style of the dress but it's time to big
3.0,The button fell off the hood the first time my son wore it. He likes it both ways but would prefer the hood.
3.0,Not quite what I had hoped for.  Did not cut the glare enough from a bright light.  But it did when I needed it for using my iPad when I have a headache.  Also they do not hurt my ears by wrapping around too tight like most glasses and they were a snug fit and did not slip off.
3.0,"I didn’t think I would like the fit of these due to the thick waist band, but it really keeps them from rolling down. Although I do not like the awkward seam in the back."
3.0,"It was not a true Navy Blue, it was a lighter color than I needed and it has weird seems on the front that were not flattering on me so I returned it!"
3.0,Charm isn't attached well to the watch so it keeps coming off and now I've just left it off. Other than that it's a cute watch for a really lower price.
3.0,Product looks good - not as heavy duty as expected.
3.0,Bought the red and white one with stripes. Loved it but then washed it and it all turned pink. Boo.
3.0,Lasted less than four months.
3.0,Shrinks in the first wash!
3.0,When received the puter knob was broken off
3.0,Masks were too large for my 5 year old (and he has a larger head). My 7 year old daughter can wear them with a small knot added on one side but still large.
3.0,The first time putting on each sock sounds like it is ripping but it is not.
3.0,Does not fit as pictured.  Sleeves are really fitted...cannot pull them up out of the way.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, two broke instantly. But they’re cute and cheap"
3.0,"It is a nice material soft and seems to be sturdy. The color is great and the embroidery looks nice. While it fit as it should, there is an issue if you have a bigger chest. It makes the shirt look a little bit shorter but other than that I see no real issue with it."
3.0,"As someone who wore Gummys in the 80s, I remember the texture and look really well. While the look of these bracelets was on the mark, they felt stiffer.. didn't stretch in the same ways... and most noticeably, smell AWFUL! I've had four of them on my wrist since I purchased them and they still stink! I can't put my arm or hand anywhere near my face without smelling the awful smell emanating from the bracelets.<br />I have a feeling another brand might get these right. This one, unfortunately, did not."
3.0,"The color is very nice,the material is soft but there is just not enough of it for my big bust.  I had hopes this would fit but it was just too small all around and I had to have help getting it off.  I usually wear a 38ddd and an XXl fits but not this time."
3.0,"I liked the sweater as it fits better than expected. However, it has these cuts on the sides that are really high so it's imperative to wear something underneath,<br /> otherwise your stomach would be visible from the sides."
3.0,Okay - does not fit or look as nice as in pic...
3.0,Great quality but too long
3.0,Every time I wear these they come off my feet. They are very cute though! Just a bit annoying.
3.0,Turned very quickly. :-(
3.0,This dress does not flair at all. It looks better in the photos.
3.0,"I like the paint splash pattern on these shorts. Wish they didn't come with the annoying holes.<br />But the largest issue with them is an inconsistency in sizing. I bought a Large dark blue pair for myself. Fits great. Then bought a second lighter blue pair in Large and a pair of Medium dark blue for my mother. They came and were correctly marked as Large and Medium but are exactly the same size. I have returned the mis-sized Large, hopefully the next pair will be the correct size."
3.0,"Cute dress great git but the fabric is already faded after one wash.  Actually it was starting to fade before washing.  Wish it lasted long but it wasn’t expensive, so you get what you pay for."
3.0,the paint is already coming off and ive only had it on my phone for a week or less. Disapponting.
3.0,Not for walking on concrete or uneven floor
3.0,"I am dissapointed in this bag. It doesn't look like the purse in the picture. Its bigger and more bulky. Its still a pretty purse, but not what I was expecting."
3.0,"A little bit big size for small wrist but in all, it looks good"
3.0,"After wearing the shoes only a few times, one of the elastic expansion sites pulled loose showing a badly frayed end and the seam was loose around the expansion pocket.  For the money this shoe should be free of such defects."
3.0,"I didn't care for the feel on my head, plus it kept slipping back."
3.0,These socks are fairly decent.  They are thin and attractive.  Upon arrival though I noticed that they have pulled threads in multiple spots where the seam might be (except these are listed as seamless).<br /><br />Pulled threads on arrival does not seem to be a high quality item IMO.
3.0,It is very small and convenient but you can only fit a few bills in it
3.0,This was definitely fit for a toddler.<br />I'm and extra small/petite woman and it was snug.<br />Small breast size and still didn't fit well there either.
3.0,"I love this earring, however I bought it for my tragus thinking it would be small enough, but it is actually pretty big. Would look best in a carriage piercing."
3.0,"Love the style.  I'm size 10, ordered large size. The waistline fit me high.  Will try the XL size."
3.0,It was a bit longer then I expected but it came in clutch and kept me warm. I wore it as part of a Halloween costume and I didn’t have to wear a jacket and ruin my outfit. The one downside was the latch kept slipping apart.
3.0,Smaller than expected. Kind of flimsy or thin.
3.0,Didn't last very long before starting to crack.
3.0,Bought this for my husband who travels a great from our son. He wanted to keep it on his keys and within a few weeks ot busted off and was lost. The hole for keychains is too close to the edge and not very durable.
3.0,I ordered the size I normally wear but it was 2 sizes too small. An XXL is the size of a Large!
3.0,Is too small and the material is very delicate.
3.0,Tail is way too short for an adult! The ears are fine. The bow tie will do but is on the small side.
3.0,"These pants are not to bad, but I've had issues with them.  One, because they are water repellent, I can't wash them in the washing machine I have at the place I'm staying because it has sensors that sense what is in the washer and since the pants don't allow water to go through it, it can't sense them and will continue to fill up the machine until the water overflows...or at least that is what the company tells me.  Second, their sizing chart does not really match up with conventional American charts.  I had to order way larger for it to fit me than when I ordered jeans.  They also don't really do Big & Tall sizes either.  Third, I've have two pockets start to lose their stitching, one is the right back pen pocket and the other is the right leg Velcro pocket."
3.0,Not kidding about the oversized.
3.0,"Delivery was fast. The flute/cylinder itself is bigger than I expected. I like my flute on the smaller side so it really slows down my breathing, but its your preference I guess. Its makes a very faint whistle noise which was not there in my previous breathing necklace, so I’m not sure if I would use it in public. The chain is also a bit longer than I would like but it works."
3.0,"I totally agree with the person saying that the second tier on the back was unexpected. It's like a second tie back above the low back... think like those tube tops with a tie back...Its really not as nice as it looks in the picture. Basically its a dress not really feeling like a cover up. I may even return it because its so underwhelming. In the picture, it looks flowy and like there's a high slit, but in reality the overlap of the slit makes it so that you would really have to have HIGH GUSTS of wind for any leg to show. Overall super disappointed. Its almost TOO much of a coverup unless that's what you want."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:7c58cc9e8818aeab346f22b3aa35c992]] No es  la misma de la foto
3.0,it is good for a cheap piece of jewelry<br />the gold colour faded really fast (less than a month)<br />but i liked it while it lasted :)
3.0,"polarized helps glare, but glasses do not brighten  in the dark at night, they are for a small face, prefer taller lens height,"
3.0,It is a little like a costume not a dress
3.0,Looks nice but zipper tore after a couple months.
3.0,"Very nice set! It does have a material similar to a table cloth, but it’s nice and stretchy!<br /><br />I am on the shorter side so i will have to hem it!"
3.0,"It's not original like the old-school tank tops, but a close replica"
3.0,The pants are super long and wide. They are really bug as well.
3.0,Seems like a good product though not as heavy weight as I’d hoped. Color is ok and stitching seems good. Not what I’d hoped from picture but I’ll ge keeping it for daughter to wear.
3.0,I do not like the way hit hugs around the belly area.
3.0,"These are super cute, but I'm a 2X in standard American clothes (5'2"", 200lbs) & the 4X overalls were still significantly too small for me. More like an American large. Also they are much shorter than the picture looks (which would have been a plus for me if they had fit)."
3.0,This was so small and tight and see through!! It was not how we thought it would be at all
3.0,Soft material but runs small. The shorts fit ok but the top is too snug. The top’s material is stretchy but it doesn’t feel comfortable to sleep in
3.0,I like the way they look. The style and color are as advertised and they look great. They came in a cute storage sleeve that is protective. I did think they were going to be line free but they are not and I can see the top of the corrective lens when looking through the uncorrective portion.
3.0,"I really liked the different light settings. The lights in the mask are very vibrant and look great at night! However, wearing the mask is uncomfortable as it is very stiff, you can feel the battery and wires, and doesn't fit very well. There is wire to help fit the mask around your nose which is helpful. I also didn't like that the filter pocket that they have sewed on the back is loose and doesn't hold a filter well."
3.0,"The bag is nice, but it is way smaller than the advertised dimensions. Fortunately, I was able to return it."
3.0,The color was a Kelly green and not the dark green I expected from the picture. It fit as expected though!
3.0,pretty dress but order a size or 2 smaller cause is very large
3.0,"I am so sad because the description and picture of these skirts made me so excited to receive them as I have been looking everywhere for long pleated skirts.. However, they are not what I was expecting at all.. First, the size is a little weird.. I normally wear a large but these are shaped funny.. the waist is small and the skirts makes that mermaid effect.. It definitely doesn't fit like an A-line skirt or like it looks on the model... Second,  the material is not flowy at all.. it's actually kind of stiff making the pleats fall and look funny...Lastly, there isn't a nice fall to the pleats so they look stuck together.. Maybe it's the material but it's definitely not flowy like most pleated skirts should be.."
3.0,"I liked this shirt but I had to return it because it wasn't just oversized, it was ridiculously oversized. I kept trying it on thinking that I just need to get used to the oversized look, but it was just humongous, especially the neck. I normally wear large and this was sized to be a 2x or possibly even a 3x. I think it was a nice quality shirt and the material was fine but the size was way off, even for an oversized shirt."
3.0,Not made for full figured women! Way to small!!
3.0,Pretty but not right size for me- returned
3.0,does not hold up well with teens
3.0,Too small and no give
3.0,They shrank pretty badly after the 1st wash and now they just fall off my feet rendering them kind of useless.
3.0,"I'm not sure what it is but when I put this on, my whole upper body just gets itchy. I'm not allergic to the polyester or Spandex but there is something either in their manufacture or creation that causes me to itch like crazy. I also had my wife wear it and she said she was itchy too. I washed this a couple times and it only helped slightly. Its too bad though as i did like the look and also the feel (outside the itching) when worn."
3.0,"I didn't like the length nor the elasticity of this dress. I'm 5'4"", 155lbs & was disappointed in the fit. I returned it for a refund."
3.0,"I bought this for my son who has anxiety. He loves his weighted blanket, but this was so uncomfortable. He thought it was itchy and felt like he couldn’t move while wearing it."
3.0,2 out of 3 are awesome. The 3rd pair has a spot of the reflective covering stuff missing as u can see in the picture.
3.0,"Love the fleece, but i but tends to fit a bit awkward with the zipper after a while. The pockets are weirdly small and cannot hold much at all, almost useless functionality."
3.0,Worked great for my Karen from Mean Girls outfit 🤣
3.0,I wasn’t able to get the buckle to adjust because the mesh was uneven. It took about 30 minutes but I got it fixed and was able to get it to work
3.0,Stitching came off after using it for few times
3.0,"Post is very short, be careful when buying"
3.0,"My excitement for this elegant vintage blouse quickly turned to disappointment.  Even though my measurements fit the sizing of this blouse for 2X it was very small.<br />I would say more on the lines of an XL at the most.<br />The fabric is beautiful.  Very elegant with its lace sleeves and upper blouse with solid bottom.<br />If this fit, I would wear it all the time.<br />My husband told me how beautiful it was and to order a larger size, but alas, this is the largest size it comes in."
3.0,Was too small but looked good but can’t keep time
3.0,"I love the dress, it looks great on and was inexpensive. There's one one HUGE problem: I smell sweat in the armpits are, which tells me someone wore it and then returned it!!!! Hope it comes off when washed.<br />If I didn't need it this weekend is ask for my money back!!!"
3.0,"it's very cute and inexpensive. cheaply made, but that makes it affordable. good gift for a cat lover. i gave it to an adult friend as a novelty gift but also gave a nice, more expensive jewelry item."
3.0,not cute on me
3.0,Color/ fit
3.0,"It fit well, but the material is different than I expected. Much heavier than anticipated."
3.0,"Only wore them briefly however, the fit was good. I was disappointed in the dullness of the color. I was hoping for a brighter red. Looks different from picture.  Good value"
3.0,Meh. It's okay. Handy but the top is open so the chapstick falls out. Cute keychain but not the most functional.
3.0,"First, the description stated 100% cotton, which it is not - it is maybe 30% cotton. VERY THIN MATERIAL - The decals are great and exactly as pictured, but I am not sure they are durable (not silk-screen).  AND FINALLY, the pieces arrived in two different sizes. I ordered for a 13YO girl, adult medium on both - she can wear the pants, but the sweatshirt was so small it is on her 7YO brother instead. AND it did take forever to arrive - ordered for Christmas, arrived in January - though that was not a surprise (it was communicated)."
3.0,Very cheaply made. Broke the first week I wore them.
3.0,"everything about this dress seemed like it could work but then i put it on.  it has stitching on the front that kind of looks like a bra or bustier ... there is nothing that works about this.  if it weren't there, this dress would be 70% closer to working for me, but it's all off.  with or without a bra the placement is just wrong.  then there's the lining - the fabric is extremely sheer, the darker color seems like it might be a little better than some of the others but it's still sheer, so the lining can help but it's soooo short - it's like a lining for just the top or something, it doesn't even come down to the top of the slit, so then it just keeps riding up.  i'm considering going a little rock and roll with it and just cutting out the lining and trying a black bra and boyshorts, maybe without the lining the top stitching will have a little more give so that the look of the bra area works a little better.  but out of the bag - this dress is just not working."
3.0,BUENO NUNCA ME HABÍA PASADO YO PIDO MUCHAS PILLAMAS Y ÉSTE TENÍA UN PELO EXTRAÑO .Y SENTÍ COSA<br />ME PUSE PENSAR ESTA USADO<br />SEÑORES MI RECOMENDACION<br />ES LAVAR CUALQUIER PRENDA<br />QUE SE USÉ PARA EL CUERPO<br />ES MUY IMPORTANTE. BUENO YONO QUERIA DECIRLO PERO<br />LAS PREGUNTAS TE ASEN HABLAR. 👀👀👀🤔🤔🤔
3.0,Have gotten many compliments on this beautiful purse. Only down side... color rubs off and leaves light spots but for themoney agreat purchase
3.0,Not even  where is lays.  Comfortable but not flattering.
3.0,Not as big as they say
3.0,I gave the products 3 stars because I like the designs on the dress. However this dress was not flattering at all. The material around the area of the abdomin was oddly billowing. I noticed the seams at the back of the dress were unraveling. The material itself looked very very cheap & super thin. I did not wear that dress to the event I bought it for. Instead I sent it back
3.0,Couldn't find the 925 stamp. But I haven't had a problem with this ring at all. No tarnishing or anything.
3.0,I like the material but way too long.  had to return it.
3.0,"Nicely made, but the cross was too big for me to fit it on my ear."
3.0,Seam on top of shoulder had a hole worn in it after 3 wears and 2 washes.
3.0,"This was super tight in my son’s face. We ended up returning it and getting a different one. But the design was cute and it was thin enough that he could still breathe, it was just too small."
3.0,"cute dress, skirt fabric is not as soft and comfortable as would have preferred/ expected. I ordered it in a bigger size thinking it would not be a tight fit; it fits well, but tighter than I expected. I will wear it out and about on weekends, its cute and casual. I'm hoping  the skirt part softens a bit after laundering."
3.0,Dinner dress but neckline too low for my wife.
3.0,"very loose around bust, tight around hips. wanted in more colors but have to find new vendor."
3.0,Too many ruffles and the material is not comfy
3.0,"Sleeves r super itchy , not sure how I will get around this . Material is not the greatest quality - shiny . I guess it’s ok for the price . Fits loose I would suggest a size under your normal size if you want a tighter fit ."
3.0,runs small and short.  It ok
3.0,Earrings are beautiful but backpieces need to be better to stay in place.
3.0,Color not ask described.
3.0,I normally wear a small and I ordered a medium just to be safe. Still skin tight - I would've definitely ordered a large if I would've known this.
3.0,too hard to clasp. thing too small on all of them.
3.0,"Quality matches price.  My real disappointment was they are provided by a Chinese merchant and shipped from China.  Had i know this I would have never ordered them in the first place.  It has been my experience that Chinese merchants working from mainland China do not practice the same honest commerce practices as western merchants do.<br /><br />So, when I wanted to return part of the order because of erroneous website description.  I got the typical Chinese merchant runaround.  It took 5 weeks and a less than satisfactory result to end the ordeal."
3.0,"I love the material, I love the print. The fit, not so much. It seems to be made wide. It's just shaped funny. A few more inches in length and a few less in width would make this the perfect tee though because the material is truly very nice and soft."
3.0,"The top is cute. The bottoms have large ovals designed on the rear. I fail to see how that can wind up flattering on any size bum.  My husband laughed and laughed. I wear the shirt pulled down over the embarrassing circles. Also, I am 5'0&#34; tall. These will probably not fit someone taller than 5'4&#34;. Item should probably be listed as petite size."
3.0,I normally wear a 2X but this top runs very large!  I will have to give it to my Mom vs sending it back and paying the shipping cost.  Very disappointed in the size running SO large vs average tops.
3.0,It's the same band that came on my Casio SGW-100.  The same band that started to fall apart on me after 2 years of normal wear.  No improvements. So I anticipate I will have to buy another one in two more years.
3.0,"These are tight fitted so it would be best to order a size up form normal, unless your child likes the snug fit."
3.0,"I needed a watch and I needed an evening wear watch.  I chose the rose tone and white face watch for it's simple and dressy appearance and it was exactly what I needed.  Before I purchased the watch I read the reviews and the one that caught my attention was about how hard it was to adjust the wristband.  So, how hard is it...I pushed for 30 mins and it did not move...pushed Harder another 30 mins and maybe it moved slightly... after more breaks then I could count and several hours later it started to move... so push HARRRRRRRRRRRRRD.  (My wrist measures 6"")"
3.0,Color is slightly off and not amazing quality but what you’d expect for a $5 Fitbit band.
3.0,"So the two picture are conflicting one shows the earring with rhinestones and one without the actual earring do NOT have rhinestones, which is misleading that being said they are very nice earrings and they came very quickly."
3.0,Hi I love these shirts good material strong and looks so sharp they give me a lot of confidence.
3.0,Super baggy around the belly. Not flattering. Will need to wear with a long top. Also the fabric doesn’t seem like the linen I am used to. A bit shiny.
3.0,"It fits but very tight on his nose, with the filter he cannot breathe. He has a very small face and neck so the top pushes his down and the rest of the material hangs. He loved the designs and didn’t want to return it🤷🏾‍♀️"
3.0,Very tight in the calf area.
3.0,"this is a really nice shirt . the only problem was the sleeves in the upper arms ,are to tight . everything else is great . color, length , style . material is very soft and not sheer or to thin . packaging causes wrinkles . i have not washed or dry them yet . i will steam iron them first . not sure if i will keep them because of the sleeves not fitting comfortably .. everything else is great for the price . shipped on time ."
3.0,Big jewel had to be glued on
3.0,"I got a medium, but they were too small and I was afraid they would shrink after I washed them, so I returned them. The fabric seemed like it was pretty good quality, so I'll probably order them in a larger size."
3.0,cute but I added elastic to the bottom
3.0,"I like the feel and look of the bands, but the pin that goes through the band to hold it, isn’t smooth and catches on everything! I constantly scratch my new baby with it just changing her, I’ve even scratched myself a few times, and torn my clothes."
3.0,Very cute when it arrived but as soon as I washed the letters started coming off after only one wash very disappointing.
3.0,"I’m 5’6 & 210lbs.<br />Ordered in white , size XXL .<br />It fit fine.<br />The arms are attached to dress (not sewn in with pattern) & easy to remove by just cutting the thread.<br />It IS light fabric & IS a bit see through but I wear a slip under it & it blends fine.<br />I purchased this when discount was offered."
3.0,"Shirt is cute, good material. A little on the small side tho and I ordered a L trying to go a size up I'm 5'8 161 38B cup and it kinda fits like a medium. It's not as long as in the picture but still cute. Also the front is a lil small and not covering the whole side boob area lol but other than that very cute for $5!"
3.0,Very thin on the small size. I was very disappointed
3.0,Very thin....but it's cute! My toddler is obsessed 🙃
3.0,Not excellent. But It's ok
3.0,Nice looking but cheaply made belt. The thread started coming off in a couple of weeks.
3.0,"This looks really nice and heads will turn when you are wearing it. However, if you have a big neck, it will fit a bit snug. My girlfriends love it so I let them wear it from time and I am amazed that it has not tarnished. It still has the original out the box shine. I just wish they made it a bit longer. It would have also been a lot nicer if the handcuff feature was the closure and the not the one they have on it. its too big, they should have opted for a smaller closure. Other than that,it's a very neat necklace."
3.0,Top it to big but bottoms fit just fine
3.0,There are different sizes on the card. I like the little ones but the I’ll never use the big ones.
3.0,The eyeglass arms are very loose.
3.0,"These are difficult to get in and after a few days ended up irritating the piercing (I have sensitive skin with allergies to cheaper metals), Looks beautiful tho."
3.0,Little stiff around your leg and rubs when you walk
3.0,"The print is on very clear and I could see/read everything. This is a decorative case, definitely NOT a protective one.<br />My only issue is that it breaks and scratches REALLY easily. Also, the case becomes very hard to take off once you put it on."
3.0,"Good quality , smelt funny"
3.0,Pretty but it fell apart after a couple of weeks
3.0,"Lovely sweater, but had to return the medium and buy a large as it runs small. Now I'm going to have to alter because it's way too long. I'm only 5'4&#34; and these sweaters are too long for people my size. Nice, but more costs to alter."
3.0,I was scared when it came and was a Large because I ordered a Small but it is obviously not American size. It fits nice and is structured. I really like the high stitching on the shoulders. Only complaint is that there is a seam running down the sleeve that is unnecessary. Not a huge deal but kinda cheapens the jacket.
3.0,Most of the bows and headbands are adorable but unfortunately I wasn't pleased that with some of the bows you had white headbands instead of the same color as the bow. Those are a disappointment.
3.0,"Beautiful and well made, but fits small."
3.0,Hat is nice bought 2 at once and both came squished in packaging . Besides having to throw them in the dishwasher and forming them there nice
3.0,These are incredibly long so if you are thinking of buying these for a lip piercing I do not recommend. For cheek piercings these would be better but these are too long for lips.<br />They are also very sharp out of package so I filed them down to make them more comfortable to put into my piercing.<br />To put the closure back in it is very difficult. It’s hard to snap the piece back in.<br />Honestly I don’t recommend these. I’d get a normal clear labret instead of these.
3.0,Weird shape to it
3.0,"very thin, did not fit my watch."
3.0,Sweater was pretty but I was looking for a thicker material. The head opening was small so when I tried it on the neck seam came apart. I normally get a large but ordered an XL because of the reviews. I could have gone a size bigger because it was to snug. I did return the sweater but that’s because it didn’t work for me. It was over a decent looking sweater.
3.0,The tos is very loose.  Would work better for someone very large chested.
3.0,Comfortable but the flower to the shoe strap fell off
3.0,Looks nicer in photo. It is still a nice necklace.
3.0,I ordered my normal size and the shirt swallows me. Wish I would have ordered down a size. Still a cute shirt though.
3.0,actually not ultra thin but for the price it's good. not durable either.
3.0,"I wish I relies how big these are. I am pierced low in my septum, wont work. Pretty big for a retainer to be honest."
3.0,"Loved the product; however, I had to returned it because the top was too small. Pants are accurate on size, top is not. Top is probably on size smaller than the expected size. Too bad cus these are super cute!"
3.0,I like the quality of the sweatshirt--but the size Large is way too big for me.  I thought I had ordered a small.
3.0,Mask is well made but the pleats make it hard to see the whole picture. It's also pretty thick.
3.0,Too big not on the foot but too tall and loose
3.0,Pretty but ace let I like the initial
3.0,"the Watch is okay,<br />then the watch belt is a little long to fit for my slender wrist"
3.0,"Loved the material and style, but for my slightly busty girls out there, it might be a tight fit. I have to reorder in the next size up and just take it in wherever I see necessary."
3.0,It has fake buttons. Material feels werid and cheap.
3.0,nice dress but a little snug
3.0,too heavy for me
3.0,Lights went out to fast and took forever to charge
3.0,"These necklaces were great, but the gold color wore off after wearing one ~15 times or so to reveal the copper underneath."
3.0,Way too small for me - so my granddaughter uses it to dress up!
3.0,See caption
3.0,"This ended up looking too gaudy.  I've worn it once with something I thought I could get away with.  But, for the price, it's okay and I'll pass it on to someone who can make it work better than I."
3.0,the chain looks rusted from the back. with my long hair you can't see it
3.0,"This hat is very packable, but was too small and heavy.. would not stretch.  Hat is nice so I gave it to my Granddaughter, she loves it!"
3.0,I liked it until I tried it on. Is meant for a long or high waist person. Didn't fit me at all and will be returning it.
3.0,"Its a beautiful hat and great material, unfortunately the head piece and the chin straps that is on the inside is not already attached and there is no instructions or materials on how to attach it without ruining the hat. Still have not used it because I can't find instructions on how to add the inside piece. A real Shame. :("
3.0,These were ok. Comes with a lot of earrings which for the price is very good. However the backs come off so easily I have lost so many pair already and they just randomly fall out.
3.0,Super cute on. Too much side boob no matter what size (I ordered a medium and large) but gives great cleavage and support. Bottoms are seen a little strange and the cross in the front puckers the bottom. Would have gave a 5 star if not for the bottom flaw
3.0,"I love the size, color and style but of theses glasses, however they are not a snug enough fit to prevent them from sliding down my nose which is annoying. I live in hot and humid Florida, so sweating only exasperates the problem."
3.0,Pretty but very big
3.0,Beautiful but not too much comfortable
3.0,The headbands are quite nice.  The fabric is soft and with just the right amount of stretch. But was disappointed to receive two of the same pattern instead of four different patterns.
3.0,This is my preferred style of earring but sadly the wire on one of the earrings arrived  a bit bent out of shape so that it needs to be handled very carefully in order to close the earring properly.
3.0,The zipper broke on 3 of the garments I purchased.
3.0,Chain got tangled up easily. Need to buy a new chain
3.0,Do not buy this product in bulk. Maybe a few pieces would have been better but out of the 40 that I ordered only about 25 of them actually worked. The other pieces were just thrown in there and broken and unusable.
3.0,The sleeves are tight and I'm not a thick person. A little annoying i can't push the sleeves up.  Overall decent quality jacket
3.0,It looks super cute but the top doesn't fit as well as the bottoms. It is made cheap but I won't be wearing the top and probably with only wear the bottoms a couple times. I wouldn't buy again
3.0,I necklace was okay. I bought it to wear to work
3.0,"A little cheap looking, but nice"
3.0,"Nicely constructed, but runs small."
3.0,Cute but super small. Young teen sized. Will give to my niece.
3.0,I was hoping for something cute and instead it was quite large and had lots of extra material hanging in the front.  I am closer to a 12 then a 14 so made for bigger bodies then mine
3.0,"Blouse was a lovely color made of nice fabric.  Unfortunately, the front pleat balloons out.  It makes the blouse boxy and unflattering."
3.0,The material is not very soft and the seam across the toes is very bothersome. I don't really have this problem with any other socks that I buy. They fit true to size though and arrived quickly.
3.0,I like the way it feels on my key ring but I would Not buy it again.
3.0,"The color of the wood is very, very dark. I think I had realistic expectations in regards to quality and how much it cost. So far it is keeping time just fine, the strap is what I expected it to be, just disappointed you can't really tell the &#34;wood&#34; feature because it is so dark."
3.0,It’s comfortable and breaths easy but it goes up to my eyes and past my chin. Way to big
3.0,"It is a nice good looking belt, but even though it came in a nice bag, it had a scratch, I thought it was a thing that I tried to remove with my nail, but made it worse."
3.0,Was too small and cannot get any larger.
3.0,"I have other Nike Air Max but the material is different, not sure if that is was caused the size variance..."
3.0,It was okay. The colors just looked old. It was just okay
3.0,"I ordered this for my daughter who is 5, and on the smaller side, I ordered a 4-6 and it was way too snug. She wore it for a few dance lessons and now I have donated it. We ordered a 6-8 for her instead! Hope it fits well!"
3.0,"I loved this dress but then on about its fifth wear, the elastic in the waist just gave out. Now it's only usable as a nightgown. There is no cinching at the waist. I was sad because I really loved the dress and got lots of compliments on it. Bummer."
3.0,"For the price, this is a good band. It’s sleek and looks chic on the wrist.<br /><br />My two major complaints are:<br /><br />1. The connector to the watch is not rose gold as shown in the advertised image. It’s gold.<br /><br />2. The snap is silver, which doesn’t make sense since the connector is gold.<br /><br />Overall though, it does its job, looks nice, and is comfortable."
3.0,Disappointed as they ran small.
3.0,Didn't fit as much
3.0,Cheap and one side doesn't thread properly
3.0,Both the green and purple bags came with a purple insert for the bottom of the bag.  Duh.
3.0,"I ordered a size 9 but got a smaller size. The package says 9 but it could be a 6. Anyways, what can I expect for the price? The picture differs from the actual ring but the ring is still pretty. I don’t have the time for a return and refund so I have to make it work somehow."
3.0,Got these a few months ago and they where really cute but I noticed most of the rhinestones have fallen out  and you can really notice it.
3.0,"Love this top. However, it did not come in the color I expected. I selected the gray as pictured. Obviously I expected the darker gray but got a light gray. Aggravating, yes. But, I will still keep the top. Just wish it was what I originally ordered."
3.0,The dress is ok. I wouldn’t purchase it again. It’s thin like t-shirt material. Would only wear it during the summertime with a slip under it. It’s comfortable to run errands in.
3.0,"Too small, other than that it's really nice"
3.0,Comfy shorts and cute but not the material I was expecting. More like athletic type not very soft.
3.0,"Completely wrong product. 2 thin layers, no nose bridge, no adjustable ear loops. Elastic worn like it may rip when stretched. Would not buy from this seller again!!"
3.0,Thinner material than I expected
3.0,It was ok... it was a little big and the lace around the top was cheap looking. Tge cut was also not flattering on me. It was ok for the price but I ordered two dresses and I am returning this one .
3.0,I’d have to agree with the last seller! You can not charge your device with this on it so it’s a pain taking it off and on to charge it!😫 But it does serves the purpose for protection!
3.0,"The earrings are as advertised and perfect for what I needed them for. However, one was put made wrong, so when they are in only one shows the beaded side and the other is the black felt. Luckily, I can likely fix it, but very frustrating either way. I docked points due to the mistake when they were made."
3.0,material is not what I expected.
3.0,you have to get the item correctly i order it 2 times i make sure my mesument was correctly and still it was to small the first time i order x large usually is my size it didn't even reach my bust second one order it 2 x large just in case doesn't fit me at all
3.0,"I liked these sunglasses. I bought these before I took a landscaping job. The lenses are nice. They look good (used to anyways). The polarization is good.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />My complaints are that they are on the heavier side and can slip off your head if you aren't mindful. I had issues with them sliding down my nose because of sweat and oily skin. The frame also collected a lot of dust from grass and other debris (this was definitely my fault, but something to be aware of). I stopped wearing them because they became excessively dirty and cleaning them isn't worth the effort to me personally. Also, the inner part of the lenses have scuffs that almost look like scratches and do not polish up using the cloth that came with the glasses.<br /><br />I would maybe have a better opinion of them had I not put them through a lot, but they helped me to realize I needed a durable and practical pair of sunglasses. I now keep them around as a backup pair."
3.0,The chain links are cheap / break easily so adjust to a size that's loose so that it won't snap on you. Other than that it's cute
3.0,Not as sturdy as the regular sunglasses
3.0,"Just got this in the mail and as soon as I unwrapped it I noticed that it's a very similar watch stand, but not the one in the picture (so buyer beware).<br />second, yeah..it's very very cheaply made but what do you expect from an $8 purchase?<br />Guess it does the job."
3.0,Soy nro 7 y me enviaron 6
3.0,It does not hold coins very well & your cards may occasionally get stuck in the pockets. Love the design but would not recommend.
3.0,"These are usually my favorite brand, and size Petite 12 fit great. This pair is 3 inches longer than my other Amanda jeans!! Love the color and fit except for length."
3.0,"First of all,  I ordered a medium but received a small.  Luckily this was not a big deal because the dress fit.  However,  the dress had a small hole on the arm.  I needed the dress for my daughter's 8th grade graduation,  so I did not have time to return or exchange it."
3.0,These were a size too small so had to return.
3.0,"The band around the ribs is too small.  I like the cup fit and back and the material, just too tight.  An XXL choice would be nice and I would order this again."
3.0,Sweater fits very short.
3.0,"This mask was purchased to wear while teaching a ladies night dance class. The mask fits so tight to the face that the material is inhaled. A plastic shield was put underneath to remedy this, but it was still not easy to get a breath through the material. For daily wear, it would be fine, but if you plan on exerting yourself, get a looser fitting, more breathable mask. Design is cute and has made it through multiple washes with the decal still in place."
3.0,I love this mask. It is rather outrageous looking. The challenge is that it has one slippery ribbon to tie it on. It won't get tight enough to hold it in place. I'm going to fiddle with it and see if I can add another tie somewhere so it will stay up.
3.0,"Meh, you get what you pay for. This purse looks cheap and smells strongly of plastic. It does have a super vibrant color. I got the green and the color is really nice. I’ll use it a few times and then probably donate it to goodwill. It’s not one that I’ll keep and reuse over and over."
3.0,"I love this bracelet as I have all 3 of my Lizzy James items. I’m not one to take my jewelry off so I’m afraid I end up damaging the beads etc. as they loose their shine and discolor rather quickly. My husband purchased a $100 bracelet for me for Christmas and by April it was really discolored to the point I gave it to my granddaughter. It does tell you to take it off and let it rest, but I think jewelry is made to be worn, dishwater shouldn’t do to much damage"
3.0,"This has a nice steal your face on the front, but there is also a Grateful Dead on the back and it looks bad. Additionally, it is not a high quality sweat shirt - Gilden - 50 % polyester. I would not have bought it had I looked at it in a store."
3.0,"These look great and I wore them a lot. Many of my friends thought they were real but the lenses can come out very easily when cleaning. I lost one and had them for about five months, wearing them regularly."
3.0,"This is a really cute watch band when I first looked at it, however, once I removed enough links (3) to fit my wrist you really couldn't see how sparkly it was and once enough links were removed it was way too tight but if I only removed 2 it was too big. On closer inspection I could see how cheaply made this watch band is. The pins that hold the band on the watch are separate and need to be inserted into the band and then attached to the watch which was a pain to do. I would not recommend this band if you want one that is going to last and one that does not look cheap. Not worth how much I paid for and not worth returning."
3.0,I ordered the +0.50 set and got sent the +0.75 instead. Not enough difference to go through the hassle of returning/replacing.<br /><br />Style is to be expected. Feels very flimsy in design and structure. Color/look of the glasses is very attractive.
3.0,too wide in waist.  low cut.  I tired takign  in on sides..  weird fit
3.0,"My daughter loves these leggings! She usually tears holes in all the rest but these have held strong. However, they faded fairly quickly and the material pills after several washes."
3.0,Has to be pressed
3.0,"But it fit a little too slim for me, so I will be passing it off to a friend.  However, the shirt is nice. Well constructed.  No stringy seams or loose buttons.  It's a nice shirt, just not for me.  Maybe for someone else."
3.0,"It fit loose and wasn't as wide as I would have liked, but still wearable."
3.0,Eh. I neither love it or hate it. The dress is definitely not as neat as the photo makes it look.
3.0,Very pretty. If you need extra room on top get a bigger size than you would normally wear.
3.0,"It's tight and doesn't breathe well, but it'd keep you dry in a mild to moderate rain."
3.0,The top was too size but the pants were too big.
3.0,"I do appreciate how soft they are, however they did not help relieve any of my hot flash symptoms like I was hoping for. They are comfortable but they don't keep cool."
3.0,bigger than expected and kind of shapeless
3.0,Had all the tools I needed. However the box was flimsy and doesn't actually keep anything in place. Holding it by the handle would cause everything to slide around. Tools are kinda cheap. I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"I love the fit, look and feel of these socks but many of the rubber dots came off on first use at barre class."
3.0,"I thought these were fine until I washed them. They pill badly. Other than that, they do a pretty good job."
3.0,"It has a great image but it looks and feels somewhat cheap, there's not much else to say I would assume. It's the sweater I would put on if I was going for a quick target run or if I had no other sweater to wear. It fits me well though. I'm a small person but I got a medium to have it bigger but when I wore it, it fit me snuggly so if you prefer a bigger hoodie Id advise getting two sizes up.<br />I usually add an image but I really don't have a picture of me in it since I don't wear it often"
3.0,The top doesn't fit snug under your breast so don't raise your arms to high... but I think would be good w a top shirt or crop top or something over it. The pants fit nicely. But it was an okay deal. The quality is ok.
3.0,They are very cute but since the nose piece is flat they fit oddly over glasses and take up a good portion if he bridge of a persons nose.
3.0,"Was a nice size and worked well for what we needed, but this thing shed little yellow fuzzies EVERYWHERE. Weeks later and it's still all over our clothes."
3.0,"Very pretty, the ball part is a little big but overall I love them!"
3.0,"WARNING: This belt is really tiny, meant for US Women's Size 1-4. It's NOT meant for medium-large women, so I am giving to my friend for her birthday."
3.0,"Nice fabric, but jr sizing."
3.0,"1st, I guess to save packaging these boots don't come in a box.<br />While in the pictures on the site these boots look nice, they aren't made for any real work.<br />I've worn these 3 times so far and there are 2 trouble spots beginning to show up. As seen in the photos.<br />The tounge is way too short, it doesn't even reach the top of the boot. Can you see the tounge in the picture? The canvas weave material they use is garbage it's starting to separate from the leather it's sewn to. I could have done w/o the AR15 logo on the side looks childish.<br />With fine wool insoles these boots are comfortable, the sole soft & giving, but the ""leather"" is on the cheap side. But what do I expect for under $60.00 boots.<br />These might be okay for a weekend paintball/airsoft game but not for actual work."
3.0,They were extremely big. I followed the size chart and wish I had sized down.
3.0,"They're sturdy and a good price but very difficult to ""open"" because of the flat shape of the ring.  I didn't notice that when ordering, so my bad.  I bought them to replace rings on key pressure relief valves and, because of the flat shape, they do not fit into the holes.  Since it was my mistake, I didn't return them.  Just make sure you look closely at the shape before ordering."
3.0,"I am 5'3&#34; and these pants, while very attractive, require alterations. They drag on the floor on me and it appears that the hem has been let out to lengthen them even more. The picture shows them at ankle length. Perhaps if I were 6' tall that would be the case. The denim is hefty and the pearl buttons down the side and very nice embellishment. The inseam on these pants the way they were shipped to me is about 33&#34;."
3.0,"Not very sturdy or durable, but looks nice, as long as you are not too rough on it."
3.0,"You get what you paid for.  It is a very cute necklace but cheaply made.  It had come apart in the packaging and I had to put it back together.  Very bright color.  Again, the price says it all."
3.0,"I'm 5 ft 4, about 149 lbs (boobs and buns) and am usually a size 10. I followed the sizing chart and ordered an xxl because of my bust. The dress was cute, has pockets and the colors were as described. I had to send it back because I ignored the reviews about how short the back was. I'm pretty short and even though I'm toned, there is no way I could walk around with my cheeks about the fall out. Sooo bummed out. Maybe it would work for someone taller (with legs for days), or someone younger or shorter."
3.0,Maybe I just didnt get the right size. going by the chart size was a little big.
3.0,"Extremely soft and warm and looks pretty in person. But it is too short so I will be returning. I'm only 62&#34; so I ordered a small hoping it would go ALL the way to the floor like the photo, which is the main reason I bought this because finding a cute floor length robe is surprisingly hard to come by. Unfortunately this doesn't reach past my calves. I ordered black but it's not the true, rich black I expected. The color is slightly dull, kind of like an extremely dark gray."
3.0,The quality of the leggings were not at all the same as previous pairs that I purchased from 90 degree. These last two pair were thin and see through. Hoping that the next pair I order are similar to the original that I loved so much!
3.0,Did not like the material quality.. Looks pretty on the Model.  Too loose in certain areas.
3.0,These are very pretty and true to size. Unfortunately whatever the wooden plugs are made with caused an allergic reaction to my ears and behind them. It’s been 3 days since I’ve taken them out and the rash is still there. I’m definitely disappointed
3.0,"These earrings are very pretty, but there are 2 reasons I only gave them 3 stars. The first reason is that the earring post is not centered behind the large flower stone at the bottom of the earring. The post is centered behind the next bead up. Because of this, the bottom flower sits too low on the earlobe and actually hangs off the bottom a bit. It would look much nicer if the flower was centered on the lobe. The second reason is because the earrings come with tiny rubber backings which do not support their weight at all. The earrings literally fell off my ears with the rubber backings. I had to swap the backings out with those large round plastic disc kind."
3.0,"This was definitely not red, more like orange. However, it’s not too bad. I was really hoping it was red!"
3.0,I thought it was very cute and fit perfect and would have given it 5 stars until I washed and dried it. It shrunk a bit and pockets wrinkled up.I washed per instructions.
3.0,"Nice looking. A bit flimsy, so I don't expect it will last too long though."
3.0,"like the fit and variety of colors,m but the material is real soft and delicate. easily torn, they might not last long."
3.0,CUTE.A LITTLE SMALL FOR ME
3.0,"The fabric is wonderful to the hand. However, the fit was weird. It has nice long sleeves generously cut. I was excited and thought it would fit nicely. Couldn’t button it across my chest. Granted I am busty, but usually can button up tops that fit everywhere else. I usually go up a size and have the waistline under the arms tailored. Returning it. I don’t think I’ll buy anymore clothes from Amazon. 2nd time this has occurred."
3.0,"Color different from ad, but was terrific!"
3.0,Great watch but dragon is so dark you can't see it.
3.0,to loose but comfortable
3.0,Perfect example of price gouging. Yes it is comfortable and easy to breath through but it is only worth about $5 max. For this cost you should receive 3 mask.
3.0,"The strings are already falling off.  Only been tried on twice.  Also, a bit see thru.  Would need a slip.  Probably returning it."
3.0,"Not as Long as it seems. Was hoping it was as long as the one in the movie, and it runs very small."
3.0,Took forever to get.  Nice hat.
3.0,"Dislike the white used around edge, looks very cheap. Also not double-sided."
3.0,Mixed review on this because I wore it to a wedding and danced all night and it stayed in place and worked as expected. I recommended it to everyone. But then I wore it to an outdoor concert that was very hot (FL in the summer) and it would not stick to me whatsoever. I had to go buy something to wear to save myself. Probably my fault for thinking it would work in that weather but a heads up to anyone who would consider it for that kind of occasion. It's ok for the first time and probably depends on the situation and sweat level. Wouldn't recommend repeated use because it gets less sticky.
3.0,"First thing is I love the 4 way expansion, I feel better that it's stretching all sides instead of just the front and back.  2nd thing - you gotta let the hat sit for a while and last thing - I felt my hat go back to original fit the next time I wore it."
3.0,"The right foot sandal caused my husband some discomfort due to a hump in the side of the insole. He typically wears an 8.5 - small feet; we ordered these in a size 9, and he is just able to close the straps at the very end - so the sandals do run quite small in his case. The look great, but the comfort and quality did not quite match our expectations."
3.0,"The purse is well made, but I ordered it in gold (Champagne) to go with a dress I am wearing to a wedding (blue dress, blue & cream shoes) and instead what I got was a pink purse. It is a very pretty pink, but not what I wanted and will not work with my outfit."
3.0,Small size. Don't stretch to fit long fingers. Can't image they would fit males well. JMO.
3.0,When writing one must write slowly.  Ink appears not to flow readily from the cartage to the nib.  Pen however is heavy and feels great in the hand.
3.0,"Okay. I own them, I wear them, they are Kay comfy.  They run wide and get wider. Soles are very slippery.  There is not one natural fiber to be found, which I knew when purchasing. For the price, they are fine - you'll get one season or less from them."
3.0,"I have silver hair, and when I have this on, it looks like a wig....still cure and I may wear it....other colors would have probably been a better choice.."
3.0,"The earrings are nice and fit well. However, i thought they were bigger more noticeable. The material is very thin and small."
3.0,"I’m 5’8” 125 lbs and I ordered a small. They fit great and are really cute and comfortable, but unfortunately they are see through. Still wearable, I just have to put on high waisted black biker shorts underneath."
3.0,The rhinestones made my face raw.
3.0,"It’s ok, print quality was ok, but I have bought other shirts for less with better quality in how the look the this one."
3.0,this item broke after wearing one time I placed it in my jewelry bag coming from my trip went to take it out and it was broken.  Looks nice but breaks easy
3.0,"I LOVED this jumpsuit. It fits very large though. I’m typically a small and this small fell right off of me. I was able to take in the top and it worked -  for the price I had to try. I took about 3 inches in on the top and just left the bottom flowy. I got SO many compliments. However, if you are small chested and can’t do the alterations yourself, this may not be the jumpsuit for you."
3.0,"Did not take well to spot removal, but others of the same manufacturer were just fine after cleaning."
3.0,It was way too small and way too tight. Felt like I was wearing panty hose on my face.
3.0,"The set came with 3 black clips, 1 poker dot clip and 2 navy blue clips. Consider returning..."
3.0,"Material is heavy due to the spandex. Because of the heavier nature of the material, the spaghetti straps do not support the weight of the entire dress. The straps stretch and expose more arm pit and side boob than necessary. Would be a good dress for bathing suit cover up, when coverage is less desired."
3.0,Soft but does what it says
3.0,"Shorter than expected. I can't wear outside, but good as pajamas. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
3.0,Nice dress..it fits small..Had to return.
3.0,Goggles seek to fit well. I docked the rating 2 stars because 2 items were missing arrourding to the box and the instructions; pouch and intrrchangable nose bridges.
3.0,Razoavel
3.0,"Bracelets are well made and cute, but the colors I received are not consistent with most of my wardrobe."
3.0,These were good for the price and a temporary fix with fast delivery. but wouldn't purchase again or recommend.
3.0,It’s cute but huge. I normally wear a large but probably needed more like a small in this item. Size way down unless you want to wear it as a tunic (I’m 5’7” and it almost looked like a short dress).
3.0,"The necklace is ok and my daughter loved it, but the red paint on the necklace was rubbed off in three spots and for the price of the necklace you kind of get what you paid for."
3.0,"The purse was a lot smaller than it looked. The price was not bad for the quality and look, it was just small"
3.0,They look really cute sad it did fit my legs
3.0,"These types of carabiner lid locks will keep a casual thief from walking off with your helmet. This will NOT stop any dedicated thief from taking it.  This unit is ok, but not any better then the ones costing 1/2 as much."
3.0,Received all the same style-stripes/waves. Was hoping for more of an assortment as pictured.
3.0,"These fit a little large but were OK for fall. The material is very light, although we haven't had any holes or fraying. The elastic waist became loose quickly."
3.0,"Coat is,well made although heavier than expected or needed for  Houstons climate<br />My negative comments concern return policy, the coat was a little too small for my grandaughter and I had to pay over $13 to return it."
3.0,You need to buy 3 or maybe 4 sizes up because these are WAY small !!!! I wear L and a 2XL is tight !!
3.0,"These rings are perfect 'middie' rings...they fit well, but they did start to tarnish after only a month. I will just buy more, they are very inexpensive.."
3.0,Pretty dress but the cut is tight. I ordered a large and I should have ordered an XL.
3.0,The jersey looks great and well made but the sizing is no where correct which is the crappy thing about Amazon. So if you order buy two sizes larger but if your a bigger person you are just outta luck with this one.
3.0,"Pattern is great, material is a bit cheap but it fits and hasn't fallen apart yet. Next time, I'd get a size up."
3.0,they r just a lot bigger than expected.....but other than that nice quality and look.
3.0,Returned.  Wasn't a good fit for my body.  Color wasn't for me.  But maybe it would be nice for others.
3.0,"Rose was nice, display box heavily damaged."
3.0,"Frame arrived broken, but it still works."
3.0,"My son loved this costume, but unfortunately, the seem in one of the legs has come apart after only a month, and may be hard to fix because of the type of material."
3.0,Hats are super cute and warm. only issue was the oatmeal color one ball on top the string holding it in place one was broken :(  I just received them and that one was defective. Not sure how to get ahold of someone to fix this. I only need the one not both. Black one is fine.  Otherwise I would recommend to buy as long as its not defective.  Would have been five stars.
3.0,Good quality. Little smaller than expected.
3.0,Better than others. They're a little sloppy in the seat. I say get them smaller than you would normally. you want them snug.
3.0,I like the style. The watch itself is very light which is surprisingly nice. The only thing is that the illumination of the hands is not as bright as I would like. But it is definitely better than the luminova (sp?). And its more convenient than the luminova since I don't have to charge it.<br />If I had the money I would have gone for a watch with better illumination on the hands and at the hour marks on the bezel.
3.0,Basic black summer dress.  I’m only 5ft tall and it was short on me.<br />It was cute but gave it away to a younger girl ...I’m too old for a dress that short.
3.0,Cute but I got a large & it was sorta tight on her...
3.0,The outside of this bag is very strong and durable but the inside around the zipper split. I’m a little disappointed but o well. I probably won’t buy from this company again due to the inside ripping so easily but I love the size.
3.0,"The earrings are beautiful.  The opal is lovely; the metal has great shine.<br /><br />Design flaws:<br />a)  The wire that goes through the ear is too long, as if leaving room for a very fat ear.  In other words, that wire should be shorter, and the actual earring part (opal) should be longer (closing the circle more).  I compared this earring to one of my regular hoop earrings, and the difference is substantial.<br />b)  Once you close the clasp, the part of the wire that is behind the clasp is also very long.  It looks very odd - almost like it is going to stab your head.  I compared this to my regular hoop earring, and again, the difference is big."
3.0,I Bought these believed they would be the exact style they weren't  ;:(  .. thought they'd match the bras I ordered.  Hmmmm.  Will keep the cute poodle 2 yr old style this time but not satisfied ..
3.0,"A very beautiful & elegant jumpsuit at a phenomenal price, however, I had to return due to it being too small overall.  Suggest sizing up when ordering."
3.0,"Pretty earrings, but a little bigger than i thought..I like small dainty jewelry...i'll pass them on to my daughter, she'll wear them more that I will..very pretty earrings though :)"
3.0,3 items didn’t work. Loved the other pieces though
3.0,Finally got something that I ordered and it was satisfactory
3.0,"It’s soft and nice material, but the embroidery looks a bit cheap, plus it runs small."
3.0,"it does look ok for the price,but it is smaller than specs shown. I spent almost an hour trying to stretch it to the size of the umbrella, but still can NOT open umbrella fully, so it standing in the corner unopened.Sad."
3.0,Its like to wear a potatoes bag :/
3.0,buy the wrong sise...
3.0,The dress was cute but the material is so sheer I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it out.
3.0,Product looks good ordered medium and it's too large.
3.0,"It's a nice-looking throw that can complete the look of your place if you follow the color scheme. It goes well with my bohemian decor. Tassels add a nice touch.<br /><br />With that being said, I do not think that it can be used to warm you up. The material is kinda scratchy and thin. It doesn't feel like a throw that you can reach out to when feeling chilly. Hence my 4-star rating.<br />I have not washed it yet, but it looks like that it will hold its shape and size if washing instructions are followed."
3.0,It didn't fit right on the top half but the bottom was okay I guess I should have order a large instead of XL
3.0,The glasses look great but they distort the images. I can't wear for a long period of time because they produce me headaches.
3.0,This is not a travel kit. It's way too big - the<br />case is bulky. 100 ml bottle would probably last for a month or more - unless you go for a long trip this is not very portable and practical.
3.0,"I think that the quality is probably ok especially for the price, but the dress was way too small.  I don't kid myself that I'm a small by any means, but thought that a medium would be fine as I typically wear anything from a 6 to a 10 (depending on the designer).  In fact, some mediums and size 10s are way too large.  It's a heavier fabric than I expected, but I thought would be ok for Florida in the winter.  I will return and try a large."
3.0,"Shrank and way too small. But I would order again in a bigger size because it's a great quality sweater. Not a knit though, more polyester feel."
3.0,"Loved this bag at first as it is very pretty. Unfortunately, one month after wear, it started to tear apart at where the strap meets the bag and I could use it anymore."
3.0,Owned these for several months<br />Pro: These are nice color. Like the pockets. They do pretty good at not attracting lint.<br />Con: feel little too high waisted. Wish the pockets were a tad wider for my phone to go in easier
3.0,For kids.
3.0,They are cute ballet flats but they fit a bit large. I'm a size 8 and I decided to buy the size 7 after reading the reviews. But it still fits big. The look is very wide and boxy. I will use them to wear around the house instead on the day of the wedding
3.0,There is a gap at the bottom of the cut out on the back when you since the ties shut so that looks odd.  But everything else about this suit is great. going to see if I can find a solution.
3.0,"They are pretty nice and blingy, but they are not for everyday wear. After wearing them for about a month, the hinge area started to crack and then broke."
3.0,"Really whack color red glasses, take some time to get use to. Don't wear while driving cos you won't be able to see red stop lights!"
3.0,"The &#34;red&#34; one I received was more of an ugly rusty orangey red and the white polka dots were much larger making it more of a white polka dot dress with a colored background, instead of the other way.  I returned mine as the color wasn't flattering on my coloring at all.  And red is MY color...disappointed because the fabric was nice and the cut was super comfortable."
3.0,This pin is large and beautiful but so heavy it’s  impossible for me to wear plus theres two large pins to try to fasten with. My wardrobe does not support heavy pins like this. I do wish a lighter metal could be used and I would snap up them in every color.
3.0,The material is very thin and wrinkles easily.
3.0,Pro: they will keep your feet dry.<br /><br />Con: slippery when wet!<br /><br />Solution: buy a pair of slip resistant shoe covers to put on over these to deal with the traction problem. Then they're usable.
3.0,"The material is very thin which something needed underneath it. But it's not bad at all. I just have to return because the arm holes are somewhat large, and the design is different from the picture."
3.0,They don't fit very well but did the trick for Halloween vamp costumes.  Very cheaply made though.
3.0,"The suit is really cute, but is extremely high cut with very little coverage in the back.  I am 5'7&#34;, 130 pounds and ordered a medium and it was WAY too small.  Be sure to order based upon your torso length."
3.0,The shirt is very soft and fabric feels good. It is extremely small for a XXL. I sized up 3 sizes and it just barely fits.
3.0,Sized a half size too large. Lots of foot slip and some hot spots. Otherwise great work boot.
3.0,Very cute not good quality tho as the color wore off after just a few days of normal wear. Too bad because it fit my fitbit versa sense and was very cute!
3.0,Beautiful dress but too low cut and tight on my chest to wear to work
3.0,Nice watch. I got the black face. It's smaller than I expected but comfortable and looks nice.<br />HOWEVER DO NOT BUY IT FOR THE ALARM.  (way to quiet to hear).  For that reason I'm going<br />from 4 star rating to 3.
3.0,It's too small for me...I like the ribbed fabric but it just didn't look good on me in addition to being too small.  Will give it away to someone or something.
3.0,There are not leggings! This is like a nylon tights! I m dissapointed.
3.0,"The boot is cheaply made, first day of wearing them to work in an office and there were scuffs and tears. They also ran a little small and not comfortable."
3.0,Beautiful dress same color as picture. But size dimension is inaccurate and too loose overall. Be careful to order a smaller size.
3.0,"I personally hate the material, and think this shirt was HORRIBLY printed and kinda ugly but I ain’t gotta wear it. So I guess it’s fine"
3.0,These boots are very cute only reason low on stars they were too narrow for my foot
3.0,There's a hole in the pocket otherwise would be 10 outta 10
3.0,The size of the braids are a little to small for me.
3.0,"I bought this for a concert. It was perfect for the occasion. It was lightweight and slightly sheer, but not enough to require more than a bra underneath. I'm 5'2 and 135lbs. I ordered the medium and it fit fine with the exception that it was very long. I had no choice but to tuck it in... so if you're a shorty like me.. plan your outfit accordingly."
3.0,Does not fit a size 11 woman's foot. Does not have much stretch.
3.0,"The chain broke the first time I wore it.<br />The pearl is a nice size. Luckily, I have a better chain to use."
3.0,"The plug is too short, doesn't fit all the way through."
3.0,The wings are small and don't fit an adult or teen that matter in larger size then a small or xsmall. Thankfully my teen is skinny and even then the wings fit tight... the head band broke before the night was over... the wings are very small not as big as pictured
3.0,"It's a bit small, so order up half a size.  Also, it starts off kind of slippery/ too smooth, so when I walk in it, my sandal will slide up and down my foot after I push off.  I'm not sure if this is because the sandal is too smooth, or if my foot is too dry."
3.0,would have preferred the legs to be a bit longer
3.0,cute dress! too small in chest so be aware ladies with bigger chests. everywhere else for great i didn’t even have a bra on when i tired it in and it was too tight up too. very bummed!!
3.0,Cute outfit but runs big. I will be returning. My daughter is 13 months and around 24 pounds and I ordered the 12-18 month size and both the pants and shirt were huge!
3.0,"Super cute, really good quality however I sent mine back as my sunglasses could not stand up it the bag and there wasn't a pocket for them"
3.0,Not the highest quality of product. Its just okay. Really.
3.0,"These are really cute/funny, but WAYYY smaller than expected. I ordered for a wedding shower in size medium for the bride, and they barely fit me and i'm a size XS.  i would say i should of ordered a size XL for my friend and she's typically a medium!"
3.0,"Bought this for our seven year old son. Figured small kids 4-7 would work. Me and my wife laughed when we saw this thing. It's about 15"" top to bottom looks like it would fit a 2 year old."
3.0,"soft light weight fabric,  sleeves too tight,  wrong color green."
3.0,"I liked the comfort , length too short .."
3.0,These work ok but are a pain to get on and adjusted by yourself.  Had my wife help get them tightened equally and after that they were fine.  Just don't think it should take 2 people to put on a belt!  But they do work as described!
3.0,I love it but it's too small wish it was made to fit like a true Large
3.0,"Neither my daughter nor I can get the goggles to work without leaking. Not bad enough that I won’t use them, but they are leaky. Nose plugs are somewhat difficult to use as they are slippery and tend to slide off. Better than nothing given the good price, but less than pleased with the leakiness."
3.0,It’s really cute but runs really small!! Extra large is like a medium
3.0,"I must just have a larger face or nose than many reviewers because these glasses were too small for me.  They are Great glasses though.  very cute and the flip-ups are neat.  They have now been added to my kids cool stuff.  Seller was great.  Glasses came promptly and exactly what pictured.  From dimensions though, I couldn't tell that they were not going to fit me."
3.0,"I bought it for my kinder girl for her school uniform, but it is too narrow. I do like that it is fast delivery."
3.0,"I am going to say that this was an &#34;OKAY&#34; suit for me. I weight 165lbs, 5'8&#34; tall and have a 38D chest. For my bust size, this was too small.<br />The bottoms match the top straps of the suit but not the pink zig zag design which made it look a bit off. Also the bottoms are slightly see-through in the back.<br /><br />It's not a bad suite, just not one for a larger gal."
3.0,I found the fit everywhere except the arm holes good.  I found it cut into my armpits at the shoulder blade level.  the top portion cup fit the broadness of the shoulder blades did not.
3.0,This is a nice enough bag but the zipper is terrible.  It just doesn’t open and close smoothly.  It’s a struggle with 2 hands.  It isn’t my go-to bag.
3.0,The fabric is very stiff even after the first wash. The unique tiger print makes this shirt somewhat fashionable but only for maybe casual events where you might want to stand out. Buttons up and seems to be well-stitched. The fabric print surprised me since the picture did not do justice to what the shirt actually looks like and the shirt is much larger than anticipated.
3.0,I didn't have the problem with the clasp.  In fact the outside has held up like a champ!  My issue was with the plastic card holder inside ended up being my point(s) of failure.  This wallet was an excellent transition to minimalist front pocket wallets.  I only wish it had at least held up for a year before having issues.  Oh well for 20 bucks what am i expecting?
3.0,"The hoodie is cute but the sleeves are just a little too short. It fits kind of weird, like it’s shorter in the back and it makes me feel like I have a hunch back. Not sure if anybody can relate to that but if you feel that way sometimes. You will feel that way with this hoodie too. Can be a great “goals” hoodie."
3.0,"I really liked the look of this from the picture, but in person it just looks off. The slip is very short and skin colored, so it looks like you aren't wearing anything underneath. Even my open minded and supportive husband thought it wouldn't be appropriate for me to wear out of the house! I'm also short, so the length was way too long. Ended up returning it."
3.0,"This was delivered sooner than the expected date. I'm 5'5 ,151lbs. I purchased a large, its slightly big but I plan on wearing a hoodie underneath<br /><br />the jacket is cute, however, it's more hoodie material than that of a jacket. It doesn't feel or look like wool or wool blend. It's pretty cute tho. I wouldn't purchase this again solely because it feels and look like a hoodie."
3.0,order oversized as they run small
3.0,The jacket doesnt look as seen in photo<br />The cut is large so its better to buy 1 size smaller than normal..tje draw string is missing as well
3.0,Quality of material wasn't what I expected
3.0,"These earrings are not as pretty as the picture shows them.  They are absolutely tiny - even tinier than most stud earrings.  The reindeer are just a shmear, you can't see the details they are so small.  I bought them for the unicorns and they looked like garbage.  I cannot recommend at all.  Low quality."
3.0,"The backpack is great, and I love it. But after two months, the zipper on one of the hipstrap pockets broke. That's one of the least important zippers, so the pack is still functional, but it is also one of the least used zippers and I wonder if this is a sign of future problems with other zippers.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller and asked if I should be concerned that a zipper broke after a little over two months. They replied ""hello friend, thanks you pay attention in our store, if the product was good, Hope you can share with more people, better by leaving review or feedback."" It's like they didn't even read what I wrote."
3.0,"This was a cute idea, and I loved the convertible style, but it runs rather large. Also, I'll note that it's made of a very hollow sounding plastic. Cheaply made for that kind of price."
3.0,"Don't see a difference in my butt, pants legs are way too long. I have to cuff them about 3 inches to not step on them and I'm average height. Comfortable though, I like the midrise and color."
3.0,"Is a little snug but not too bad, not super supportive but it is a brallete so it’s okay. Super cute!"
3.0,"I did not buy these from Amazon, but bought the same model from another retailer. I wore them for the third time and the frame broke. I emailed into customer support and have to pay $9 for them to ship a replacement for something I've worn three times. I normally pay the shipping fee for gas station glasses and have them last significantly longer for the same cost. When I asked them to waive the shipping fee due to the short duration of ownership and how easily they broke they just kept saying as a small company they can't waive the fee. These were already some of the most expensive running glasses I've purchased and now with the additional replacement shipping fee they are the most expensive.  Would advise looking for a company with a better policy."
3.0,clip on yellow glasses are hard to clip on to regular glasses but the y work well reducing glare at night
3.0,"The bottom color on the shirt is actually a burgundy red, not the pink color pictured. The shirt pilled after the first wash. Not impressed with the quality for the price."
3.0,"This was too small.  I'm 5-4, 100 lbs."
3.0,"Not the best, kind of have to really work it to get a couple grains. But you get what you pay for and its cheap and looks nice on the table."
3.0,"Hat is very warm. Although the mask is a thick filter, it does make it hard to talk through it where people can understand. But overall great product! Very stylish! I received multiple compliments!"
3.0,It's alright. Didn't look like the picture. All the metal pieces were at the bottom and isn't as nice as I had hoped.
3.0,Great pants but the zipper gets stuck in the down position. It got stuck open several times at the urnial. Looks awkward when im yanking on the crotch of my pants in the at the urinal.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:eaa477c3a3d138d257e653c44302b695]] I feel like the air pumps are pretty glitchy. Definitely a hand work out. It does work most of the time and is pretty cute. Better for kids but adults can wear it too. My almost 4year old struggles with the pump.
3.0,Cute ring. I coated with clear nail polish just in case. :) Worth the price!
3.0,It is a beautiful pendent it just was to small  I did returned it.
3.0,"This shirt was a tight fit. I like loose fitting. It is a cute shirt but I just didn’t feel comfortable in it. Too tight and the sleeves wear too puffy for me, even though that’s what I like about it in the picture. It would be cute but not for me"
3.0,This is warm. The scarf and glove part is amazing. My only problem is that the hood shape is a little awkward. It's more triangle then round. I don't  like that  about it. But it's  actually just like the picture
3.0,"I purchased this on Jan 21 2021. I'm just a few weeks shy of one full year.<br /><br />I have three issues with it:<br /><br />1/ since the beginning: the sides can catch fabric easily and rip it off. Watch out for cloths, towels, or nice clothing you might have, because it could get damaged.<br /><br />2/ since a few weeks ago: at the beginning, the magnet and coarseness of the band was VERY good and would stay in place all day; now it's a bit softer, the silicone padding around the magnet is thinner and everything is smoother. So it doesn't hold all day and you need to adjust it several times a day (not for comfort, but just because it's not tight anymore)<br /><br />3/ since this morning, it's half broken (see picture). The band is getting out of the socket on one side, so I can't wear my watch anymore.<br /><br />Overall it's very decent for the price, but I'd rather pay a bit more to have something more durable.<br /><br />Worn 22 hours a day for almost a year."
3.0,"these are a good slipper. they can not be washed though. I washed them and they fell apart. :( but, before they fell apart they were great."
3.0,I have this dress in almost every color. This one red doesn’t fit like others
3.0,"I guess I should have known by reading the description more closely but when they say latex, they mean soft rubbery material. I was expecting this to have more of a ""shape"" to it so if you were to put it on or take it off it retained the shape of a helmet. Not so much, flat latex with tiny eye holes and no real extras to make breathing easier. It's ""OK""."
3.0,"Nice jumper, but *very* small.  :(<br />I ordered a Large (normally wear a size 10), and it's *way* too small.  Very disappointing."
3.0,I like the look of these ski pants however they run one size smaller than noted . I had to return and didn’t exchange for another size but went with a different option.
3.0,"kinda small around ears, but still very nice"
3.0,It says leather me is plastic
3.0,I thought the pendant was a little bigger.
3.0,It was ok. I mean the price was cheap so the bag was cheap but I've gotten better bags for the price before. Not really white it was more like cream or pearl.
3.0,I loved the boots. They are exellent and easy to walk in. The only problem I had is I ordered a size 9 but they fit a lot tighter on my foot than all my other boots. Still a great product and I would definitely shop from funtasma again. I'll just be more careful with the size I order next time.
3.0,It's a beautiful ring I received so many compliments the color did change though
3.0,The waist is very high and the dress seemed a bit short - but cute if you have a short torso!
3.0,"I read these ran small and ordered larger than my ordinary size. The things and leg are still quite tight. However, the waist was too large. My impression is these may have been cut to be somewhat &#34;unisex&#34;. I want to wear thins without a belt under a tunic and these waist was so loose, that the tight legs tended to exert a downward pull and the pants-- though in some ways tight-- would fall off!<br /><br />I fixed the problem by purchasing a yard of non-roll elastic, and stretching it to take up 3 inches, and sewing that to the inside waist band."
3.0,"**Keep in mind I bought this pack for roughly 17$ and that brings the cost of each ring to about 2$. In other words, I got what I paid for**<br />The 7 rings came in and 6/7 were the correct size. The main one I wanted to wear often (black) was size 12. That makes it a 3 star review as well as the fact that it feels and looks cheap. I can see excess “silicone” on the edge of almost every ring left over from the molding it was probably taken out of. I wouldn’t say it’s awful because I’m sure it will be perfect to use when being active. I have no clue about the longevity of the ring because it also feels cheap. Would be a great temporary ring."
3.0,"This looked ok on. It was strangely tight by the breast area. I'm not a flabby person, but it definitely created a strange armpit flab situation. Cheaply made so you really only get 2 or 3 wears out of it, but this is all just part of buying something at this cost."
3.0,Bought xl was more like a m/l other then that love it
3.0,"This product isn’t squat proof, it’s pretty tight around the butt area and it definitely doesn’t have a whole lot of give. It’s nice for an upper body workout day. I will say the color is very very cute and the waistband does snatch you but it runs down a bit. Overall 5.5/10"
3.0,The size it was unexpected because it's say it fits small so I order one size up from my original size and it's fits too big
3.0,Cute but a lot smaller than i had hoped (pictures were kind of misleading).
3.0,"My initial feelings about these slippers prompted me to give them 4 out of 5 stars.  However, I am returning to compromise my original rating because these slippers have stretched, the internal padding is flattened to the extent that it feels like I have a few layers of cardboard between my feet and the floor.  They're still &#34;together&#34; and I hate giving negative feedback.  But, I unfortunately would not re-purchase these slippers and because I am a devotee to the Golden Rule, I came back to revise my original rating.  ;-/  btw, I am also not so heavy that my body weight should flatten the padding out completely (@135').  They're just not 'timeworthy.' I'm sorry to report it. Thanks."
3.0,"I ordered a bunch of clothes and this is the piece I was most excited about.. I’m so disappointed.. the material is thick and stiff, the front comes up a lot higher than the picture and feels restricting. The pockets do not lay flat and make my hips look strange... and it is too short - falls about 3-4 inches above my ankles (I am 5’8”). The side slit goes all the way to my buttcheek and I don’t feel comfortable wearing it. Sadly will be returning this one."
3.0,"True to size. Buckles are not adjustable, leather upper and outsole. Quality is not what I expected for $260. So...going back.<br />One more thing, the hardware is gold. Dont know if thats important to some but for me I prefer silver."
3.0,scuffed right away
3.0,Not crazy about these do not reach knee
3.0,"I am a fan of Bonlavie. They make really pretty costume jewelry which is typically hard to tell from the real thing! This pendant is so very large, however, that it shouts ""FAKE!"" I wish Bonlavie would make it in no larger than a 6 by 8 mm size.  Still, for the very low price paid, I can give it to my goddaughter to play dress up!"
3.0,Ok.  Could be better.  Stones need to be placed correctly.  It might have just been the one I purchased.  I am working with it.
3.0,Need more card slots
3.0,"Cute! Except runs big, I got the small and it is still pretty big on me :( . Otherwise, decent quality"
3.0,"This is ok. The letters are very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, small."
3.0,Looks a little more pink or coral than red due to the white stitching.
3.0,"I did not keep these shoes as they came a day later than expected and so I got them when I returned from my trip :(  that said, I did try them on and while my foot fit fine, my toes were snug and I was not in love with them enough to keep them.  I normally where a size 91/2 but 91/2 aren't an option so I ordered a 10 and I was still a bit uncomfortable so they went back.  I thought the review would be helpful to those with a similar size foot as me."
3.0,all thats ok.
3.0,"Bobdoles wife who is about 5-7, needed another 6 inches of cape to touch the ground much more to drag behind her for her costume.  Again great quality just not what we thought it was."
3.0,"The fabric was very thin, the zipper was hard to open and close."
3.0,"A little snug, fits more like Large size than an XL."
3.0,Pretty enough but bags out badly
3.0,"The scarves themselves are fine and the two colors we received are pretty. However, I would have not ordered so many if I realized I wasn't going to receive all of the colors pictured."
3.0,These earrings are extremely heavy
3.0,longer than i expected. maybe I shouldve ordered a size down rather than a size up.
3.0,"This bra was going to be worn with a foam pad after a mastectomy. But the fabric is very rough. It screams ""old lady"". Just looking at it in my drawer makes me wonder why I bought it in the first place."
3.0,"Cute but not well made, the clasp wasn't closed all the way so it kept falling apart and I'd have to fix it."
3.0,"This one size fits all isn't a great idea for sunglasses. Ordered two pairs, neither fit my head at all (entirely too big), my boyfriend just took them off my hands. If you have a large head, or you like bigger style sunglasses these will rock your world."
3.0,My teen loves jammies. I bought her this set which is gorg but extreamly sheer. She still likes this set a lot.
3.0,Very sexy dress just a little to loose around the curves that i need defined.
3.0,I like these and the quality is decent. Unfortunately the paint job is inconsistent and the red stitching on one side is way off. I still wear them though.
3.0,This was a pretty shirt but the size seemed to run really small. I could barely fit in it despite ordering the same size all my shirts basically are.
3.0,I’d say these were in the middle . They were soft yet the bottoms hurt my feet . No I would purchase these again . I would recommend to younger person because my feet were killing me .
3.0,"Top fits okay, the elastic could have been tigher, but I fixed it by sewing it a little. Now it (the internal shelf bra) stays under my breasts rather than riding up. The bottoms were horrible. They were too large and a little deformed. I can't wear them. I will wear the top with other boy shorts that I have and throw out the bottoms. There is no saving them.<br />The material is good, but it remains to be seen if this will be see through when wet."
3.0,The dangles started to fall off as soon as I opened the package.
3.0,"Unlike other firstgear jackets and pants, these run at least one size small.  If you like a roomy fit, and who doesn't in hot weather, go up two sizes...."
3.0,"I ordered the XXL-3XL (be careful to check the measurements, as these are Chinese sizes). I tried one on when I bought it, and it wasn't too tight because I followed the measurement chart. However, when I actually wore it, I discovered the bottom of the bust lining only came to the middle of my bust. Awkward!<br /><br />I tried to figure out why, and realized the problem was that the straps were short, like they would be on a much smaller size cami. I am going to keep these and lengthen the straps, but I won't buy them again.<br /><br />It's a very nice silk fabric. I wear them as underwear, rather than as a top, and I know how to sew and have a good-size stash of fabric, ribbons, etc, so it should work OK if I put a strap extension in the back. But I would not recommend this for anyone who wears a larger size."
3.0,Shoes were a lot more pointed than they looked in the picture.
3.0,good for the price you pay
3.0,"They are ok, but issues with arch support, sometime they are not comfortable."
3.0,"These are very thin, and not very long.  I ordered them to accessorize outfits on a cruise, so I guess they will work, but you get what you pay for...they look cheap.  I hope they don't ravel on the edges because they are simply cut, not hemmed....which I believe it may state that in the description.  This would be better suited for a child's dress up trunk."
3.0,I’ve had other resistance bands before and they’ve lasted a long time. These were delivered to me on July 10 and it’s now August 10 and one is already broken. It popped in the middle of a workout too using them as expected on a chest fly drill. When I got these they were thinner than I expected and I was wary of them anyways. I have reservations that the actual weight listed on the bands is accurate anyways because I’m not that muscular of a person and I maxed out all the resistance of the bands on certain workouts already. It’s a nice thought but idk how it’ll translate to putting actual weights on a machine or something and doing the same reps. I got these with a discount code and this reason is probably why they had a discount code anyways. I might recommend these to people but with hesitation
3.0,Size according to breast size ran too big.
3.0,"I bought these boots for my husband because he needed waterproof boots for a school camping trip.  I didn't want to spend a lot because he probably wouldn't wear them much and these were reasonably priced and looked nice.  He wore them one day and said that his feet hurt after only a an hour or so of hiking.  They might be ok if you could ad a cushioned insert or arch support, but I doubt he'll wear them again, so they will likely be going to the Goodwill this weekend."
3.0,"The color of this shirt is a very pretty blue. I really wanted to like it but when I put it on, the sleeves were way too full. More like a balloon sleeve than a puff sleeve. This style does not fit me correctly. If you like a very full sleeve, then you would probably like this top. The material is very soft."
3.0,Cheaply made and cheap looking.
3.0,"When I got the necklace out of the package one of the bigger beads on the end had come off along with a handful of other beads that was behind it, I was able to fix it, needed it and couldn't send it back on the timing that I was needing it. Beautiful costume jewelry though."
3.0,"Material is thin, kinda see through. Good for the price"
3.0,"Material is not what was expected, but it will work."
3.0,"Flat earrings I wanted for my 2nd piercing, however they are too large.  Otherwise they are okay"
3.0,"As much as I wanted to love it, I just hate the material. It is thick and pretty but not comfortable.."
3.0,Buying a jet!!!
3.0,"It was pretty, but for some reason I thought it came with two, my bad!"
3.0,Assembly is difficult and the design is flawed. Other design only required putting the pole together
3.0,"The cats are beautiful but for the size (x-large) it doesn’t seem roomy. Am disappointed in the sizing but pretty shirt. It may not fit the person I purchased it for, but “ it will “ make a nice pillow case ; )"
3.0,"The red is vibrant, but the fabric has a cheap feel and movement. Also, this blouse does not work for women with a large bust as it makes the front of the shirt rise too high. Would probably work for women with a shorter torso or smaller bust."
3.0,"Noisy metal, possibly silver.....?! Not impressed."
3.0,"This shirt is ok. I like the color, the lace inserts, how stretchy it is, how soft it is, how flattering it is, and how comfortable it is. I don't like how thin the material is and how there were several loose strings I had to cut off. Both of those reasons lead me to question how well made the shirt actually is. It's really cute and fits me well, but I don't think it will fit well with another shirt underneath it. I certainly can't wear it alone now in the middle of winter in Minnesota. Overall I'll try it in the summer again and see if it's warm enough to wear alone then, but I'd probably find something else if you are looking for thicker material. This is very light weight!"
3.0,Thin material. Does absorb sweat well. Doesn't compress.
3.0,Material is nice. Overall fit is nice and comfy. Only issue is I ordered black and got red.
3.0,"They do a good job of blocking out noise, but are difficult to put on and take off."
3.0,I loved this dress!  I ordered a size up from what I normally take and it was still too tight!
3.0,"Its cute. Not sure how accurate sizing is because I bought this as a gift, but the onesie piece of the outfit looks very wide to me. Not the best quality fabric - onesie is cotton, diaper cover has more of a silky feel."
3.0,Cute and comfy I’m normally a large and I ordered a size up like the comments said and I’m glad I did. 3 stars cause it came with a hole in the sleeve.
3.0,Its z sticker love it or leave it
3.0,"Very pretty, helped make my huge smartwatch look somewhat feminine.  However, very scratchy and gets caught on things a lot.  Also already started falling apart after a week of wear."
3.0,"This scarf was pretty and well worth the money. It could have been made out of better quality material in my opinion, but otherwise a great product to buy and very stylish!"
3.0,"I bought these around Christmas, wore the daily and now in early June the inside sole is coming undone, making an uncomfortable lump. Also the women's xl is small for my feet (men's 11)"
3.0,"This is probably obvious, but I thought I'd try - this dress isn't for gals with wide hips.<br /><br />I used the size chart provided in the photos.<br /><br />The top fit fine, was a bit big to be honest. It will fit because the fabric is stretchy, but if there's a pattern it's obvious how much the skirt is working to hold your junk in.<br /><br />I returned it."
3.0,Purchased this product last minute to go to the beach. It arrived on time but was a little to small. I am a bigger chested woman & if I was not careful the slightest movement everything would fall out! It worked for the time I just had to be extremely cautious with no sudden movements
3.0,Fit wasn’t what was expected.  The reck area is really wide so it look sluggish.
3.0,Cute but was disappointed in the material.  Very easily wrinkled.  Also when got it had to wash it 3 times cause of a very strong smell. Also very small.
3.0,"Definitely does not fit like an original band, makes the center piece very wide and bulky, edges don't meet, and the keeper slides away from the excessive band all day, over and over.. definitely not a Garmin."
3.0,Hard to keep on thumb
3.0,"It’s cute. Not great for small boobs, as there was some gapping, and the material is pretty cheap. Overall, it’s an ok top."
3.0,I think the gloves are great very good to protect you the welding but when I used them on my first day welding I realised that they sent me a man&#34;s large or extra large  no way that is a women's medium because in that case I need a small or an extra small
3.0,its okay but kind of thin.
3.0,It is an okay material.  The sleeves are short a little longer than 3/4 sleeve. They don't come to the wrist. Otherwise the fit was okay.
3.0,The fabric is thin .
3.0,"I usually get a Large, which is what I ordered.  It fits more like a medium.  Was hoping it would slouchy like the photo.  I don't think the quality is very good either.  I will have to be careful when washing as I am pretty sure it will shrink quite a bit."
3.0,"I like the lenses being blue reflecting, but really want to have a blue lens.  These are grey in color with blue reflecting on the outside. They are stiff at first, but work well."
3.0,The seat isn't full enough. It's cut for someone with a flat butt.
3.0,"Happy with these earrings, except for one thing. In person the color is much more muted and dull. It is not as bright as the photos. The size is accurate. The back of the earring to secure."
3.0,"I washed it and guess what... it shrank. So, if you're a medium get a large. I got the dress to wear under things as a slip. So, it's no big deal that it's now snug.<br />The dress looks just like the photo and the fabric is soft."
3.0,This was not a beautiful dress as pictured. It looked tacky and shapeless on.
3.0,You have to put the two small pieces on by yourself. Good luck getting those tiny pieces to open with grownup hands.
3.0,a bit bulky
3.0,"if you are a woman and think you will look like Vee. then yes get it. If you have a big head or are a man, don't get it"
3.0,"Top of them have no give at all, they are quiet small."
3.0,FUN TO WEAR AND WELL MADE.
3.0,"The quality of the wallet is mediocre - the metal logo on the front is slightly skewed (not horizontal) and the back of the wallet was scratched already when I got it out of the box. The leather is quite thin and the magnetic lock is quite strong, so the lock threatens to tear the leather around it every time you open the wallet.<br />At that particular moment I just had my card details stolen - so I was in a hurry to get any RFID blocking wallet before a long international trip and didn't care much about the looks - so I didn't bother to return/exchange it.<br /><br />Now, a year later, it's still holding up - no more scratches, zippers are working fine and the lock hasn't torn the leather yet (although the leather is already stretched around the lock so I have to be extra careful to open it). But most importantly, it does block my cards.<br />I also got a passport holder from the same manufacturer and its quality seems to be okay."
3.0,"This bag was good for use during vacation - big enough to fit small wallet, phone and sunglasses while fitting loosely across chest for easy and hands free use. My only complaint is the construction - the Velcro patches sewn on to hold the flap shut were sewn on in opposite directions (one was sideways and the other was up and down) so it didn't close properly or hold as securely as I would have liked. Really unfortunate because otherwise this would have been a great product."
3.0,Too big and the neck collar is weird
3.0,"I suppose its my fault for not reading all the details about the item but when I tried this briefs on, I noticed my friend was sticking through the sock thing.  I was originally planning to wear these with my running shorts.  I wanted something moddest to hold everything snuggly underneath my short and thin running shorts.  Needless to say, I won't be wearing these anytime soon under my clothes in public."
3.0,Earrings are perfect but I ordered two 8mm and recvd 6mm and an 8mm. Disappointed because I wanted to wear these right away.
3.0,To big...
3.0,"Lasted me 9 months. They’re not bad and won’t cause mold to grow on them in moist environments, so I’ll buy another pair and see how long they last. They’re not the most comfortable, but they’re not annoying."
3.0,Not the best material but I'll take it for the price.
3.0,"I was under the impression i was buying little girl socks, but they fit me... A woman who wears size 8 shoes..  Decent quality though"
3.0,The top runs smaller then expected. If your busty them straps will dig into the skin. The bottoms are good.
3.0,"Overall the design of this scarf is pretty much the same as the MITZAH ABCDIOR ""C"" PINK SCARF, but the colors are off. It’s a lot more pink and orangey brown instead of the peachy pink and tan brown on the original. The picture used is actually the stock photo from the Dior website and not of the actual item."
3.0,Very very tight. Size up.
3.0,"If you want a watch with a bit of bling for more formal occasions, this is a good choice at a good price. It is large though."
3.0,"The pants themselves are of good quality, nice color. But the waist is way too small. Even after ordering a second pair in the XL, it was still too tight. This was for a man who is only 138 lbs, and short. It should have more give to it.  We gave it to someone else who said it probably will fit him.  I wish I would have known this fact before putting so much money into it ( them)"
3.0,Broken stone and cheaply made or it would have gotten better reviews.
3.0,My fingertips are still cold.  The finger shafts need to be a couple of centimeters longer.
3.0,"Okay product, nothing special"
3.0,I planned on using these to keep my child warm under the school uniform tshirts. She is avg height and weight for a 6yo. The bodice is quite form fitting while the arms are not. They are very long and could probably be worn as a dress! Great quality thick stretchy fabric. Hope it doesnt shrink in the wash.
3.0,"The item was too small, however, Amazon returned my money no problem once I returned the ite."
3.0,"These were for a team gift, and I added a team photo to the center along with a little color tassel. I was disappointed because some of them did not fit together as I expected they should, and would need an extra drop of glue on the outside to hold the photo in the frame. Overall, it was a cute, inexpensive team gift, but making sure they didn't fall apart was a challenge."
3.0,"Material is not as expected, Fit was good."
3.0,I wouldn't put anything more than a single key on one.
3.0,"I loved this bag and probably would have purchased again, but decided not to do so. The design of the bag's 2 front compartments were very useless. The weight of the zipper pulls kept the 2 compartments open all the time. You could not put anything into those pockets because the zippers would always fall in the open position. It probably would have been better if the zippers were reversed to pull down instead of up or a lighter weight zipper pull. Otherwise the 2 compartments served no purpose and it was annoying having to zip them up all the time. It was not a very good look having them open always."
3.0,The colour had more blue than green.
3.0,"Child loved it. However, within the first 15 minutes of play two of the blue rhinestones fell off. Superglue fix them. Was hoping for a little bit better quality."
3.0,Muy larga la manga
3.0,cute purse but front zipper only for looks
3.0,"Disappointing.  I was really looking forward to this necklace. It came in an envelope, within the envelope was an ordinary box with a velvet presentation board.  The stone itself was in a separate bag as was the necklace. The actual size of the stone was very nice and it was as big as I had hoped. The setting was lovely, and it allowed the stone to catch a lot of light. The cut was very nice. The stone itself was rather disappointing. It was not the deep purple that I had seen and hoped for. It was a lighter color with shades of amber when the light hit it. There was no richness to the crystal.<br />The necklace was way too thin, and way too short for a stone in a setting this large, it was a complete misfit.<br />For this price I expected much more."
3.0,Loved the bag when it arrived. Totally worth the price! But I have to return because it is missing the clasp to close the bag. Only the bearings are there. No strap or button. So sad!
3.0,Looks like I thought except it has white bands to hold the strap down and a white surface.  Very noticeable
3.0,But snug and the lights stopped almost immediately.
3.0,They look good but it is NOT a leather belt !
3.0,"The reviews were great sparkle shiny but tasteful. Mine are just so so. Good for everyday, like a bit more sparkle for evenings out."
3.0,My daughter didn'tlike it:(
3.0,"Very pretty when it arrived and I wore it a lot, but it tarnished and the silver is wearing off."
3.0,"Shirt fits as expected, feels nice, and my son loved it, however the picture on the front is fading terrible after only 3 gentle washes. Definitely disappointing."
3.0,Pretty but runs small. I have small-med. wrists & it is snug. I'll be giving away.
3.0,Really like the pink top but it didn't fit. Shirt itself was great but built in bra was much too tight. If you are larger than a b cup I wouldn't recommend.
3.0,Quality not the best. B-
3.0,"Product is a bit snug in box, so you have to sort it out, to look nice and blooming again.. It comes in pieces, so you kind of have to fumble around with figuring out how it goes together. Or what works best for you. I honestly wouldn't order again, but it's okay. It certainly doesn't sit on my head the way it does in the picture...."
3.0,The material is great and it's very cute.  Gave it a 3 star because it is smaller than I expected.  I will have to work on it to make it not fit quite so tightly.
3.0,"While I live this sweatshirt, the graphic on it is peeling off. I’ve worn it two times, washed it once inside out and hung dry. Sad to see it was coming off when I wanted to wear it again."
3.0,I love it. It is a really beautiful necklace. BUT Mine is broken the end of the center piece is broken.
3.0,I can barley get these on my hands and I'm afraid once I do they will rip. But they haven't so far. Owned them a year but maybe warn three times due to the exhausting adventure of getting them on!
3.0,Not as I expected this sweater to be.
3.0,I got the pink dress in a size medium! It’s soo beautiful. I weigh 160 ibs and my height is 5’4. The problem I had with it is it was too short. I could not raise my hands all the way up without the dress going over my behind. So disappointed. I really loved the dress but had to return it for that reason.
3.0,I thought I was buying more than one it was a bust for me
3.0,Just got these shoes today & I'm a little disappointed. They're great shoes but they have brown stains on the outsoles.
3.0,For smaller than expected
3.0,Does not look as fasionable as in the photo. Fits more baggy/box-y and the buttons were not straight... diagonal in a weird way. Its okay for home I guess.
3.0,"Bought several of these for my fit-over sunglasses.  They offer an excellent casing and the clip can be fastened to a belt or a purse handle.  BUT, the zippers on 2 of the 4  I ordered were not sewn on to the case very well and after a few months they separated from the cases."
3.0,These earrings are MUCH LARGER than they seem to be in the description. They are too cumbersome to wear. I am sorry I purchased them
3.0,"After all the complaints about sizes being too small, I decided to order a size that should fit, thinking that it would be nice and tight. Well, it was snug but not tight like I hoped. Oh well."
3.0,"**Check the fabric of each dress in the description before buying. Some are different than others***<br />These dresses are really beautiful and true to the photos but I ordered two of them and they were made each of different fabric/material. I expected silky stretchy material and I got it (here) on the white one with the butterflies but on the purple/black/white dress with the roses, I got a stiff material that could not stretch one bit. I ended returning the dresses because the medium was slightly snug, though it fit (I am a size 10) and the L was of that uncomfortable material. I think for thinner ladies, either of these would work. But personally, I like a little breathing room. If they had an L in this white dress, I'd have gotten it, but it was not in stock. I should have checked more thoroughly on the material. I simply assumed they were all made of the same fabric."
3.0,"It's adorable but the watch band is too small, cheap and uncomfortable to wear. I'm keeping as it will cost more to return and look for a replacement band"
3.0,"The idea of the product is great but the color wasn't as dark as I needed or as picture shows, and they were too large for my son's shoes, not sure these are really for little kid shoes."
3.0,"the green under the lace does not come up far enough, does not cover breast area"
3.0,Its ok but not what I thought it would be.
3.0,The color wasnt as pink as shown in the picture. It's more of a faded purple pink. I got a small I'm 5'2 and a 34a I wish I got the m.
3.0,Too big and was expecting swimming bottoms with it. Disappointed !!
3.0,"Not the material I was expecting, no adjustable straps."
3.0,These are very pretty but heavy in my ears.
3.0,Really see-through.
3.0,"Short length , light not heavy, shows well , but I wanted more weight to the silver."
3.0,"Bigger than I thought it would be; a little heavy, had  a ding in the front like something may have punctured the bag. However the vendor did accommodate me with a partial refund if I kept the bag."
3.0,"Nice earrings, but it took two months to get them."
3.0,Likes: love the necklace. It's great for a guy and is black and has a great design. It comes with an extra chain.<br /><br />Words are misspelled. I was planning on gifting this as this person loves crosses but when I went to look at the wording... there's a couple of them misspelled.<br /><br />Brover (should be braver)<br />Beleeve  (should be believe)
3.0,I ordered a size that was too large and had to send it back. The material was also a little on the thin side.
3.0,I sent this item back  because I didn't receive the sailor tie with the costume. In some of the pictures that other reviewers posted they did receive the tie. The outfit looked wrong without it. I really liked the quality of the skirt and the top. I totally would have worn the skirt with another shirt just everyday. I ordered an XL and in US sizes I am usually a Medium. Top and skirt fit well. Probably could have gone with a Large but I was comfortable in the XL.
3.0,"This was a replacement gift for the exact item that broke ;  it was disappointing that the first one broke soon after it was too late to return it.<br />This is the 6th one, a gift, so the beauty of the items is there,...and I'm counting on the durability of this .  Well see."
3.0,"I really liked the look of this waffle knit tank, but in person, it's quite uncomfortable. The fabric is very stiff, and the fit (for me at least) was unflattering. I ordered a Small and it fit more like a Medium. The arm holes were too big as you could see my bra on both sides, and there was no 'flow'to the shirt. It doesn't move with you. It's just stiff feels bulky. I wouldn't recommend this shirt to anyone I know. I dropped it in my Goodwill donation bag."
3.0,"Nice suit, just a bit large. Too much trouble to exchange, so will wear as is."
3.0,Fits pretty loosely so beware. Good material but can look a bit too slouchy with such a big collar.
3.0,"Cute earrings for the price. Not much weight, pretty colorful. The posts were bent down however, so be careful bending them back up. Also they didn't come with earring backs."
3.0,"It fit okay, but returned because the material makes it look too shiny."
3.0,"cute, but not very sturdy...broke the second time my daughter wore them"
3.0,I had to paint clear nail polish on them as they will turn my toes green eventually. It came in a giant set and was very affordable. Would buy again.
3.0,"I bought this on a whim. I haven't entirely decided whether or not to keep it. It's exactly what it looks like. It's thin and flimsy, but that is the impression that you get from the photos! It would probably be really cute in the summer with some high waisted shorts. It definitely needs a steamer, which seems a little excessive for something so cheap. But you get what you pay for! And it is adorable."
3.0,Cute dress. Doesn't fit right at the bust.
3.0,"Not as good as they looked. Poor quality. But, ok."
3.0,"These two blouses are well made but the sizing is entirely wrong.  I ordered a XX Large which is the largest size available and they were smaller than a normal Large USA size.  This company is making a very nice product however it does not meet the sizing charts for USA women at all. The style and material are fine, just know that the sizes are at least two sizes smaller than indicated.  ie:  2X is size of 18 USA and the XX Large is more like a size 18-20 and it is suppose to be a loose fitting garment."
3.0,"First one arrived and the nexk was unraveling, so I returned it. The new one arrived quickly but it's pretty small.  The XL fits like a medium at best. I'm not going to bother sending it back again. It's wearable, just not the fit I want, so it will be for around the house only"
3.0,"I bought large according to the description the length was 20inch but it was only 15 inch long,  returned"
3.0,The antlers fit an adult head but band had no extra support. They kept slipping back ancc Dec forth.
3.0,It is extremely thin. I'm not a fan of this shirt
3.0,Uncomfortable when working
3.0,"I really love the cat pendant, but the chain is very thin.  This is a gift for my granddaughter, and I know she can easily break that chain.  I will have to buy a stronger one and put the cat pendant on it."
3.0,Great wallet. Have to jam in the credit cards or IDs and it will tear the sides.
3.0,"The sweat shirts are very thin, compared to what I have purchased from the Champion brand, before.  Disappointed, could have bought it for half the price at Walgreens, without the Champion logo."
3.0,Wasn't the right size and didnt fit normal
3.0,It is adjustable and looks cheap.
3.0,To small returned them
3.0,These worked out fine but run a little small and are for woman with smaller than C cup breasts. The straps are quite thin and did not offer full support like some other brands.
3.0,"I would love love love this dress if it fit. I ordered large, I usually wear a 14-16 - it came marked XXL but it was just too small.  I'm sad! it's beautiful and the fabric and style are great."
3.0,"This runs big!! I wear med-large in clothing and chose a medium, but should have went down at least 1 more size. The fabric is also pretty cheap feeling. That said though, the print is gorgeous! I will have to wear it with a wrap top or buttoned up cardigan over the top portion, otherwise it looks really sloppy, but the wrap top does give it a beautiful ball skirt type feel."
3.0,Loved the bar size but the jewels fell out
3.0,Chain poorly made
3.0,Very tiny. Too small for the affect.
3.0,Wish they were a little smaller
3.0,This was way bigger than I was hoping it would be.
3.0,This isn’t bad but I wouldn’t buy it again. I got a 2t for my 21 month old since that’s usually his size and we buy Carter’s all the time. But it’s too small. More like 18 months. And it’s not great quality conspired to what you would expect from Carter’s.
3.0,"These are kind of funky and I wanted to try something different.  I can see the green nose-bridge part when wearing these.  That's my biggest complaint.  I think these are best for someone with a larger face (I'm a petite woman).  I also find that I have trouble finding them because they blend in when I set them down -  LOL.  The lenses are fine, work well.  No screws have come loose which can happen with readers from other makers.  They just weren't really the right fit or frame for me.  I'm still wearing them though.  Mainly first world ""style problem""  ;-D ."
3.0,Very pretty but the chdin broke away from the flower portion right away :(
3.0,"Dress just barely fit, but decent quality. I would suggest a size bigger than what you normally are."
3.0,"I purchased a similar item with another seller and this one does not suck in my stomach the way the other tights did. These tights also roll down while working out, which can be annoying. I'm not sure if I would be purchasing more since the quality feels cheap."
3.0,"They are to small for men's feet , heel slides down and off to easily."
3.0,"Started running and do to my schedule only able to run in the dark. I looked at numerous on Amazon and decided on this one for the price and reviews. The front light works great and lasts for numerous 5K runs. The back however only works for one and if really lucky 2 runs. The runs average between 30-40 minutes so no reason for the back light to go out. Recently have experienced the cord is separating. This is less than 3 months old, used 2-4 times a week and shouldn’t have these issues. Great concept just not great construction."
3.0,"Decent quality. If you order white, the fabric is thin and your child will need a slip underneath."
3.0,"They're pretty, but super hard to put on and take off :("
3.0,"It was too small for me and not as spiffy as the picture. The brims looked wider than those of the real product. Fortunately the hat was a fair fit for my wife,so we are not returning it."
3.0,Too big for 5 and 3 year old hands.....maybe next year.
3.0,Super cute but not made for a large chest and runs SUPER SMALL!!  When I took it out of the package it looked like a littke kids swimsuit.
3.0,Too small across the ball of the foot
3.0,The socks are comfortable but the colors are faded and not vibrant as shown in the picture.
3.0,Great just a short chain if other than a child wears it
3.0,This fits well but it’s way to large at the neck.
3.0,"Lovely yellow. Adapatable to many outfits. But!! (1) the underskirt shows a bit, (2) is not as “A line” as the picture portaits"
3.0,They rub my little toes and the top of my foot.
3.0,"I like the product but the pads do not seem to cover as much as I would like. I am a D so I got a D as it suggested. My sides and underneath feel exposed and if there was more I feel like it would better support me like a push up bra but it was too narrow and short to grip everything. It was a little difficult putting it on and tightening the drawstring because I don't know how to put it on. Other than that I like material it was comfortable to wear and take off, it didn't slip or fall off."
3.0,I’m 5’3 148 pounds 36DD (not the perky kind) I ordered a medium it fit good but was too short for my liking just above my ankles and the slit does not show .
3.0,It was pretty.<br />It came completely flat so there would have been some molding to do had I kept it. One eye hole was very misshapen. So I sent it back.
3.0,I normally where a medium and they are kind of tight around my thighs
3.0,A flattering out but not lightweight especially as apart of summer beach wear. It hot where i live
3.0,"Top was too big, bottoms were too small.<br />I wanted to love it because I’ve been searching for a zip up bikini all summer .. sadly this wasn’t the one for me so I’m returning it. Pretty suit though."
3.0,"I love these tights because the pattern is adorable, but they're SUPER thin material and in turn not warm at all. They're relatively see through because of how thin the material is actually. They're also a &#34;one size fits all&#34;, which as a tiny person means they can of hang off a bit and look like I dont fill them out. Kind of sad, but whatever, get what you pay for."
3.0,Bought the large Bengals one for my 10 yr old and did not realize these are toddler sizes. The coat is really good looking with stitched on layered lettering. My only complaint is the sizing should have been advertised better so their would be no confusion.
3.0,Can’t really give a true star rating as they are a gift. They came today and say Made in China on the tag and packaging. They look very small. Not sure they will fit the person I’m giving then to or not. Most likely I will return them and get her some not made in China.
3.0,Buckle is awesome but the belt it self fell apart with in 2 months but i also use a plastic holster for my gun so think that's why it wont last.
3.0,Very pretty but runs very small. Ordered a size 10 for my size 9 toddler and she still got friction blisters on her heels and instep. I'm hoping going up 2 sizes will fix the issue.
3.0,Condensation on the inside and phone was wet
3.0,"Disappointed.  WAY overpriced for what it is.  I thought it was beads and metal, but it's a plastic claudaugh symbol.  I bought it was a gift, but it was too cheap to give as a gift, so I gave it to a kid to play dress up.  Too bad too, the beads were gorgeous and it came in really lovely packaging."
3.0,Too small. And the tag is on the outside. LONG SHIPPING wait time
3.0,"A little on the cheap side-not sure how long it will last, but not bad for the price!"
3.0,"It fits, but was too short to be worn as a dress. have to wear it as a shirt."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3a8e1a0da92fe3d68df2fc9c4ae6fd71]] I bought this as a memorial for my Guinea that recently passed and It came bent. Its upsetting  because I can’t bend it back without risking snapping the poker off
3.0,Looks nice but it's already ripped from inside.
3.0,I will keep it and wear it but it’s very short and I’m not tall or have a long torso so I can’t imagine how short it is for tall gals. It also runs very small. I normally get a L or even sometimes a M. This was an XL and is snug.
3.0,Great band. Easy to install but it was extremely hard to remove one side. After fighting 2 rounds of removal I will keep my original white band and order a different brand for a black option.
3.0,"Fabric is ok, but the zipper is a bit flimsy."
3.0,I am 5’0” I weigh 103 lbs these are SUPER comfy I like the material and I like the high waist. They fit everywhere except the hip/butt are I would have liked them to be a tad bit more fitted. I ordered an xs
3.0,"Dress is fine but looks a little cheap. Kinda boring too, wish it had better design to it."
3.0,"I wanted to buy many of these but after a few washes the material starts to ball up. Doesn't stay nice.  Good for only workout pants,  not public."
3.0,too small and tight
3.0,"These are really nice, they look great and met my expectations. The only issue I had with them as that the nose pads were already adjusted / bent. This was to the point where I didn’t want to adjust them more because I was in fear that they would break. For the price I was hoping I wouldn’t have any issues. While this was a minimal issue it is still an issue."
3.0,"It fits wonderfully, for the most part! Using it for a photoshoot. Only thing is I have to figure out how to disguise the inside white lining right at the belly area - it shows and looks weird. Any suggestions would help!"
3.0,"I was surprised to find that the lumpy places on these don't exactly match the lumpy places in my two pairs of Birkenstock sandals. As a result, they don't feel as good in my shoes as wearing my regular Birks feel. I'm going to keep using them, but I'm unlikely to buy another pair when these wear out."
3.0,Kinda tight. I am a 2xl normally. I ordered this in a 3x because I like my vacation clothes baggy. It fits but it's not able to be buttoned up comfortably.
3.0,"sleeves are a bit short, no so soft/warm either"
3.0,"It did seem to be just a little too big for me. Maybe sizing down would've been more helpful. Also, the boning wiring started to peek out of the bottom after like 2 times of wearing it. It was kind of a disappointment, but all in all, it does make you look a bit slimmer and may even be useful if you chose your size correctly."
3.0,It is pretty but I received this as a gift and am using it to hang on my mirror in the car because it looks to big to wear as a necklace.
3.0,I absolutely loved the print. The fabric was a bit heavy and I guess I didn’t pay attention to the fact that They had pleats.  They were rather large pleats which Are not as flattering as I would like.
3.0,"They’re very snug, Id reconsider the true to size option<br />Also, Theyre not see through, only reason why I’m giving 3 starts. I ordered the black ones green and ombré"
3.0,super cheekyyyyy!!!!! this is a thong
3.0,"The skirt is exactly what I expected, but about two months late."
3.0,Not wrinkle free
3.0,What I kinda expected.
3.0,I really love the front of the dress and the green color but when you turn around there’s too much fabric and its all bunched up. No matter how you tie it..  it looks awful in the back on me.  I’m 5’5 34C and 125lbs and got a small.
3.0,"I like the purse in general because it has many pockets and you can hold many  things in there. The ID and credit card slots are a great asset as well.  However, the smell is horrific.  I wore it to church and everyone including myself felt as though it had a fishy smell.  I smelled it straight from the package but hoped after a few days the smell would dissipate...it didn't."
3.0,This suit looks exactly like the picture and its supper flattering.  I gave it 3 stars because the material for the top part of it was made poorly and the second time I tried it on the mesh ripped. I was able to fix it by putting more lace over it though.
3.0,"It's nicely made, just arm wholes are a little tight. And the shoulder pads look a little awkward."
3.0,Ok for the price if you have a butt these are gonna ride down like none other though and if you wear a jock to work out this is a problem
3.0,Very lovely earrings. Quite a bit larger than expected.
3.0,This thing broke down pretty quickly. The inside fabric to separate the compartments completely ripped apart at the seams and became bunched up at the bottom. I eventually turned it inside out and cut all that out.<br /><br />I am still using it as my everyday wallet but cards fit a little funky every now and then due to some of the bunched up fabric still stuck inside.
3.0,Good for an emergency pair only. Lens not very clear but good fit in a small crossbody bag.
3.0,Super cute but did start fading after a few weeks of use
3.0,Was larger than regular size 11 so one size smaller
3.0,They are very big
3.0,"The pictures in the listing and the description in the listing are not what you will receive.  After the purse arrived I contacted the seller through amazon because:<br />1) this purse was to be 100% cotton canvas<br />2) this purse wa to arrive with a cute<br />Charm fob<br />3) the colors were upside down from the picture on the listing<br /><br />I actually thought I received the incorrect item. I did receive a response back asking me to send pictures.  I did this and was informed that listing was wrong.  The purse is made from PU Leather (pleather).  I was also told that if I wanted the fob I could return and reorder the product.  After reading some of the other recent reviews it seems that no one recently has received the fob.  Initially I had decided to just return the hand bag.<br />In the end I decided to keep the bag.  It is sort of cute.  Mine is sewn well and I think it will hold up for casual useage.  The interior material to me feels like other material in other hand bags that I own so I have no problem with the interior. Also, it is fairly roomy.  Keep in mind this is a hand bag.  You cannot carry it over your shoulder if that is what you are used to doing or were hoping to receive<br />Overall, if you are looking for a cute pleather handbag that you can fit a tablet into this bag may be right for you.<br />I got to 3 for this purchase as the item I received was not what was pictured or described on the page.<br />I did receive this Winkine women tote bag at a discount in exchange for providing my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,I cancelled this order. Runs very small read the ad copy - a 3X-L is a size 14!
3.0,The Thong seems a tad bit big for my waist I purchased a L im 34C 28 40 5 ft 3.5 in
3.0,"I am in the process of losing weight (35 lbs. so far) and am switching to smaller sizes.  I have gone from 2x to xl now but ordered 2x for these because a lot of moisture wicking shirts are slim fit.  These are way too small.  I plan to fit in them in a couple of months, but the size is very misleading.  Length seems good though."
3.0,Cute necklaces but changed color really quick.
3.0,Pros: The fabric stretches nicely and is comfortable and holds up well to the trail. Cons: The bulky waistbands and fairly useless back pockets are lumpy look lumpy and also make the shorts hot. Probably well suited to a cooler climate. Size up for comfort.
3.0,Very cute. True to size. Love the stretchy material. Super super cheeky.
3.0,Decent quality leggings but they run small.
3.0,"If you want glasses that look cool then sure go ahead and buy them. If you want to drive in the sun with them, might as well not wear any because these don't help when driving. I should have read the description before buying. I still like them though."
3.0,"This item looked nice but usually it was too small. I usually wear an XL, but this XL fit like a L. I would have liked to try XXL, but it was sold out. Therefore I  never got to test it out in the gym or test its durability after washing. Buy one size up."
3.0,"Love the all cotton but this is a bikini, not a brief."
3.0,"Material is nice, pretty toasty, zipper is a little cheap. I used it for a costume and it worked nicely enough"
3.0,This product looks great but runs way to small.  I bought several pairs but because of the size they will never be worn outside of my house. Size is just not true.
3.0,The shoe is cute but runs small
3.0,I would recommend buying a size up. Product runs a little small. Still looks and feels great on.
3.0,I liked this dress at first. It fit as expected even the arms which in other reviews said they were tight but that was not my experience. After seeing pictures tho I did not realize my bulges were on display so I recommend shareware to smooth those out. My pantyhose had a control top but that was definitely not enough. The material is kind of nylon feeling so not forgiving at all. I bought an xl and I'm a size 16/18 normally.
3.0,"Sizes run small and waist snap closure is weak and pops open often, must use good belt. Good pocket configuration (identical to 5.11) but not the best (TruSpec takes the cake when it comes to the best pocket configuration).<br /><br />I'm a 38 waist, ordered 38, barely closes. Need to go one size up but they don't offer this short in 40 in any of the colors. The colors are great though, especially the Tundra. The fabric is greta too, wicks moisture away and dries super fast due to it's high polyester composition. It will repel water at first but after consecutive wash cycles it loses that ability (all tactical shorts do)."
3.0,"The bag is great for my needs.  It has more space than you'd think and it isn't huge.  I can fit all sorts of things in it (including a small notepad in the middle section).  I use this for work and it is great with all the different compartments.  I can separate things and still find everything.  The only negative about this bag is the quality of the zippers.  The inside zipper broke immediately. I opened it to put something in the compartment and then it didn't close.  As it was inside it wasn't a big deal.  About half the outside zippers have been sticky since I got the bag but as they worked it wasn't a problem.  Unfortunately, one of the outside zippers just broke.  It no longer closes.  I now have to look for another bag.  I know the bag was on the cheaper side but 3 months of use is way less time than I was expecting.  With the way I use them at work my bags usually last about a year to a year and a half."
3.0,Had to return it it didn’t fit the computer my wife has it would have fit mine...
3.0,"Unless you look like the girl in the photo, this dress will NOT look the same on you. lol"
3.0,Quality is just “ok”. The cuffing around the wrists and bottom aren’t the same color as the rest of the jacket.
3.0,"fit as expected but the material was too thin, and kind of cheap."
3.0,Liked the  color.  Shorter  than  expected
3.0,Shoe good construction; just too big .<br />No 1/2 size so followed their recommendation to go up a size . Too much .<br />Should go to smaller size.
3.0,"Cute suit, but not for any woman with large hips."
3.0,Does the job  ok but does not fully clean
3.0,"I ordered Pink - it was not pink, more of a light orange color.  Needed it for an event but had to return because of the color."
3.0,"I love the fit, but so disappointed that they don't have white and colors in petite... PajamaJeans... why don't you make more of a variety for short waisted people?  I would love a pair of Bermuda shorts, but I hate when they don't fit right and the crotch is hanging."
3.0,These are cute but are tighter than my other compression socks. I can't wear them all day long because they're too tight.
3.0,Great fit an fabrics.  After single wash the fabric formed many little balls ruining it.
3.0,"Revised review: shrunk after one wash. Still fits, but definitely smaller.  Size up.<br /><br />Bought one for each of my daughters. They both wear a size small. Fit perfectly. Both girls were happy with the fit & style."
3.0,"I purchased this shoe since I've always thought of B.O.C. as producing quality products. I am pleased overall but not completely in love with it. I wear a 6.5 in shoes so of course I sized up to a 7. I do have somewhat narrow feet but I'm usually ok with standard width. This shoe barely fits in my opinion. My toes are right at the end. They do NOT overlap, but I prefer to have more room in the toe area for a sandal since I assume my feet will slide a little. There are no problems with the width for me but again, because it just fits, others may have issues. I looked in the mirror to make sure my heel isn't hanging off the back and it's not but again your toes may only have a little clearance space at the top. There is a small amount of cushion which is nice and the shoe itself is surprisingly light (weight).  I'm satisfied for the price I paid (I purchased them for significantly less)."
3.0,"Strong, nice finish, as described.<br />Hard to open/slide onto tie."
3.0,"I had such high hopes for these pants. The pros are that the material is nice. They are very lightweight, but quite warm. However, they are far from perfect. For me, the biggest problem is the size of the legs. I have large calves and could barely pull them up. As a result, they look like low riders. Also, I am a size 2 and the size 4 was huge around the waist. I thought I could pair them with a belt but there are no belt loops. Why this is the case is anyone's guess, but it is a big problem. Since I got these for free, I will keep them but had I paid retail, I would send these back. Still, if they fit your body type, they may be a nice option."
3.0,"Material is cheap, but price is good"
3.0,Too tight across the chest. :(
3.0,"These socks were really cute. Said they would fit up to size 10, but they don't. Not very well at least. But they are still super cute to pass on to the younger sister."
3.0,This is perfect if you're looking for a longer oversized pullover to wear with leggings but if you want it to fit as expected I recommend sizing down.
3.0,"It came quick and I was very excited to be able to get all three charms and be able to wear them alone or mix n match , I have gotten many compliments on it .the only thing that I was unhappy with was that when it came the chain was so knotted up that it took me over a half hour to unknot it"
3.0,"Looks good, but needs a retainer solution across the top, it just slips off to easy."
3.0,"The print is not as vibrant as it looks here.  Also, sizing is for a small to medium sized person.  The fabric and stitching are good quality."
3.0,This dress was perfect and fit as expected. It ripped in two separate places within the seam the very first time I wore it. I was disappointed.....as I had to leave the event I was attending due to my dress being torn.... I will be returning this product with the expectation of a full refund. I wish it would have been made of a better quality...
3.0,"I like being able to cover my Fitbit with the cover that comes with this band. However when I use it, it tends to irritate my arm after extended usage."
3.0,"Amazing gloves, however it was a size too big"
3.0,"This matching mask and bandana set is very cute. It has adjustable ear loops and they feel comfortable. Unfortunately, the mask is on the larger side and it goes in my mouth when I am talking and breathing. I will have to wear it with a mask bracket to keep the fabric away from my face. I think this mask is purely for fashion because it is thin. I will have to wear it with another mask underneath since I feel this has not actual protection. The bandana is 22x 22. It fits my small dogs and my German shepherd no problem."
3.0,It did not fit me and right and it kept on slipping off it felt like it was not the right size for my wrist even though  i made sure I got the right size before I bought it
3.0,These are okay. They are super thick. The length is pretty long. I
3.0,It plastic on top!
3.0,"Im always a M size when it comes to tops and dresses, this dress runs larger, with a tank top under it I was covered, and the material is SUPER comfy."
3.0,I mostly dislike the fabric.  It is a heavy poly.  I live in the desert so no good to wear in the heat.
3.0,This is a good work sweater but within two weeks one of the pockets came off.  The stitching had unraveled.
3.0,"Ok so I love the style. They are the exact style, shape and size of my Ray-Ban Wayfarer Ease sunglasses. They feel like decent quality too.<br />Firstly there is very little graduation in the tint .. looks like there is more in the photos..i like it lighter at the bottom for reading and dark for sun protection at the top but they are almost all one tint and quite dark.<br />The progression takes a little getting used to and unfortunately it won't work for me. The reading part is fine but I can't wear them for distance... I do not need any help for distance so everything looks blurred, I can't see clearly and it could be dangerous for driving . Unfortunately I'll have to return them. I wish they had no magnification one top. Then they would be perfect."
3.0,Not true to size runs a little small but pretty
3.0,Way too large! Not true to size or size was mislabeled. Could not use or return in time to receive for Halloween.
3.0,"These sunglasses fit great, they look nice, but the picture is a bit misleading. They're not as reflective as they look in the picture, you can still see your eyes behind the lenses"
3.0,I wear a medium -large in stretchy sports bras and sized up due to reviews but this was still too little coverage for keeping the ladies centered and supported. Expect to spill out.
3.0,Torso length is a tad short on this top but everything is is ok
3.0,"I was hoping they would stay stuck a little better. No support here, just nipple covers."
3.0,Super tight around the next. It’s pretty but small
3.0,Not 100% what i expected.
3.0,I like the fit of this dress just loose on the chest and shoulder. I wish theres an extra small
3.0,This was for my son's girlfriend for Christmas.  It was just &#34;okay&#34; and seemed a little chintzy...but what do you expect for $10.00?  It's fine for teenage lovebirds :)
3.0,These are nice gloves and well made but run small. Def not one size fits all. Wouldn’t even go on my hands - the fingers were too tight. Returned them for a refund.
3.0,"As expected, on the cheaper side"
3.0,They don’t run true to size! They run big
3.0,"I got this for my son who swims regularly. They look great, however they do fog up a bit, and they also come off easily when he dives in the pool. We tighten them so that they wouldn't fall off so easy, but it seems like they still come off sometimes."
3.0,Didn’t work well
3.0,It's only round one side I was mistaken when I bought it but it's cute
3.0,got it for my daughter and she loves it. true to the photo.((((UPDATE AFTER BUYING AND BEING WORN FOR 3 DAYS)))))  DAUGHTER IS SAD. HER FINGER DID TURN GREEN AND THE RING LOST THE SILVER COLOR ASAP.  IT WAS SO PRETTY . SHAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG.
3.0,"Unfortunately the color of the fabric doesn't look like the pictures in the product listing page.  The item I received is a ""pastel green"" (like an Easter egg color), not a dark rich green like in the listing page photos.  The plaid stripes are a light violet/purple, not black like in the photos.<br /><br />If you are going for a look with lighter pastel colors, then perhaps you will like this color scheme.  ...But I was going for an edgy ""punk-rocker"" sort of look, and was expecting the colors to be about 3 times darker (like in the listing photos).<br /><br />...So I requested a refund.  Amazon was very helpful, and refunded my money right away.  If they didn't honor the refund request, I would have given the product 1 star, but since Amazon did what they could to make things right (and gave me a full refund), I am giving the product 3 stars (because other customers may like the color scheme, if they are expecting pastel colors, rather than dark/rich colors).  I have included a photo of the product that I received, to help other customers out (so that others can see what the colors actually look like).  Perhaps some other customers are looking for a pastel pair of tights and will want something like this."
3.0,The screen protector was very easy to put on and it fit perfectly. The screen still responds as it should. The only negative would be that I have had the screen protector on for about a week and I noticed this morning that one of the corners was already coming off. The good thing is that the package came with 6 so I can easily replace it. I just hope that all of them don't last that amount of time.
3.0,would not drawer down to a small.
3.0,"I’m 5’8”, 150 lbs athletic build, I purchased a medium.<br />These are super cute on and flattering to any body, really. I love the color (I bought the light grey/white ones from THIS seller). They’re squat-proof for all you lifter girls out there! Comfort level would be on an individual basis thou, cuz they really ride up the booty ESPECIALLY while doing any kind of squat movements or the leg press. I don’t like that. The other thing I’m not impressed with at all is how rough & scratchy the material is. I bought the exact ones in dark grey/black from a different seller and they’re not like that at all!!! So, if I choose not to return them, I will probably wear these on more of a casual level, definitely NOT on leg day!!! They are definitely flattering thou, and I love the white/light grey color in these!!!"
3.0,Kind of cheesy but it does its job
3.0,"It's okay. The slit is weird, the material is cut in a way where it shows all your imperfections... Not wicked happy with it, but I'll wear it occasionally."
3.0,"It was a very pretty bra and the material wasn't bad. But I got a medium/large based on some reviews and it ended up being super tiny. I'm a 36C & it didn't even cover half my boob, was super bummed out."
3.0,"The color is lovely and the fabric soft, however I am concerned that it is incredibly sheer. I will need to wear a slip with this dress. It also arrived extremely wrinkly."
3.0,not that great!
3.0,"Cute and not expensive. Gave it too my 12 year old grand daughter. Beads are nice and sparkle, she likes it."
3.0,"The shoe feels very comfortable, the fit is great, but the white is not white. It is light gray or taupe even. I'm very disappointed because it looks white online, and is called Bianco. Wth?"
3.0,They're okay and I'm not planning to buy again. I've had them for 6 months and they are losing elasticity and starting to ride up. The material is heavyweight and I regret taking them on my European vacation because they take FOREVER to air dry.
3.0,I am 5'7 145lbs. Tight in the chest. Fabric is stretchy.
3.0,got my usual size but these were way too tight and  miserable to wear
3.0,"Runs very small. I am usually a large or XL, 5&#34;1', 180 pounds. I ordered the XXL and it fit perfectly. It's a little short so I had to be mindful of bending over. I used it for my wedding dinner and loved it! Had some issues with the zipper, it isn't the easiest to close."
3.0,Stitching isn’t holding up as I expected.  I have had to repair it twice.
3.0,"I searched long and hard for a watch and settled on this one. When it first arrived, I was excited to try it on and check it out. My first impression was it's so big. I tried it on and it was so heavy. This is in comparison to my other watch which was on a much smaller scale. I ended up keeping it despite its cost and not real happy. Over time, I have grown to like it. No...I'm not in love with it but I'll be keeping it for awhile before getting a new one. They next time I purchase a watch, I will definately not get the one with three circles in the middle. They are useless and make it difficult to glance at the time real fast. It's too busy on the face.<br />UPDATE: Owned less than a year, battery already dead or so I think its that. WIll prob purchase new watch as I don't really care for this one."
3.0,The thickness is great. They are very big though.
3.0,"I really like the dress but when I received the package yesterday and opened it up I noticed a few things.  There were no tags on the dress which made me feel like it was used and not new. Another thing I noticed was as soon as I opened the bag the dress was in, it smelled of cigarette smoke which new clothing should not smell like that.  I am contemplating sending it back for a refund but since it had no tags to begin with and the bag said it needed to have all tags on it to return it, I'm not sure that I can return it?"
3.0,Good fit should have went a size down. Seems like it runs a little big
3.0,Not really impressed with this one it was to large for my son age 10. But the spider man one fit perfect!
3.0,It definitely fits on the tighter side but it's cute. The weird thing is that it's advertised with a button on the  fabric across the v but there is no button.
3.0,Ok for special occasion
3.0,The shirt does not fit like the pic.
3.0,It will suffice.
3.0,"Fits right and is a good quality, but looks rather boxy and is a little snug around the ankles - so you end up taking short, stubby steps. Whether you want to, or not."
3.0,"The dress itself is very pretty, unfortunately it’s really tight in the chest. Wish it fit better because it really is a beautiful dress. I’m thinking if I went up a size it will fit better"
3.0,Shiny but cheap.. scratches easy.. I bought a different case
3.0,"not very high quality. Water soaks into the edges and size holes. replaced this with a Fossil leather watch band for not too much more. But this beats the crap out of the base band that came with the Gear S3. Thin and great color, just material will deteriorate due to water and time(3-4 months till I replaced it)"
3.0,the right eye lens is a darker tint than the left.
3.0,Not crazy about the material. Too thin.
3.0,Heavier than expected and the material comes off.  No other than that feel comfortable.
3.0,"very cute, just wasn't my style"
3.0,"I love this product! I have been buying it for years for myself and as gifts for family and friends throughout the United States.. It is a little costly so they all wait for me to buy it for them! Unfortunately, lately we have experienced poor workmanship with the boxes. At first, I never complained over the years because I figured...I must have just gotten a bad egg in this batch. But lately the workmanship has continued to get worse! The stitching at the bottom does not hold up at all!! I often order and give as gifts so I am past the return date. Still ordering them because I have faith that the company will listen and get their act together.  Great product but I am not happy discarding 1 out of 3 bags!!!!!"
3.0,"wish the lettering lasted longer, my husbands has worn off,  we wear them as our granddaughter is in the Air Force, maybe if the lettering was<br />in-bedded it would, or at least you could still read it, just a thought"
3.0,"I bought this as a ring for my four year old. He loves it and wears it always. I know it's a toe ring, but it works and the price is great. It's durable, cute and that's about it."
3.0,"Like the skirt,but the waist is small,and uncomfortable."
3.0,Unfortunately my husband didn’t like them so they were returned. Just personal choice but the quality was fine.
3.0,To small Harley Davidson clothes run small
3.0,"Lizard broke after wearing it for six days.  I suppose since it was so cheap, I shouldn't expect it to last too long, but six days is ridiculous."
3.0,Charm fell off within first month.
3.0,These shoes run very large. Had to send first pair back and even the second pair they resent was still large but I just wear heavy socks with em.
3.0,"This hat is just &#34;okay&#34; - it is a little snugger than I would want but kept it anyway.  It is cute enough, but not great!"
3.0,Fit Larger & length longer than expected
3.0,"I bought these hoping for a good quality sock, that would last quote a while. I was unpleasantly surprised. These are quite thin and look more like a tube sock than a crew style. Maybe I'm just picky about socks, but these didn't fit the bill."
3.0,I was expecting a little shine to these earrings but they are have a flat finish -- too dull for me. I returned them.
3.0,I love this band but the description stated it was a small and it is much larger than my original band and is a little too large. The color is great  and it stays on my watch good though.
3.0,Small band.  But okay for price
3.0,Nice looking but very hard to program
3.0,"The material of these ""yoga"" pants is that of the ""buttery soft"" microfiber fabric.  These aren't made like traditional form fitting yoga pants, but more like pajama / lounging pants. This type of material shows every imperfection of the body, and highlights cellulite. They are too long for my liking and I will most likely trim about an inch off the bottom. The fit is true to size. Lightweight. Washed and dried well."
3.0,I was disappointed that these do not hold my hair.  They fall off like so many other hair bands do.
3.0,Size is a little small. Will be returning it.
3.0,I ordered a XL which is supposed to fit a 16-18 but it was extremely too small and not true to size. However I liked the shorts so I returned them and now I'm reordering a XXL so I'll see how that works out in a few days.
3.0,Knocked 2 stars off for false claim of rfid blocking. I put my work badge in a every pocket and it still triggers the rfid doors at work.<br />Otherwise it's a great wallet!
3.0,I love the fact how oversized they were. Dropped them one time the lens fell out and won't stay in.
3.0,Beautiful shirt but I wish was better quality.  There were tears in it upon arrival and it feels like super delicate material.
3.0,The glasses themselves are nice but they are not sized for adult heads... the metal is good and the glasses look and feel REALLY nice but they are more like tiny glasses you let sit on the tip of your nose. In the photo is a comparison to a pair of &#34;normal&#34; shades of the same style. The ones I was hopping to get more of. (top are one of these bottom are mine)
3.0,opening is huge
3.0,i like the leather key ring but won' t fit my Honda key.
3.0,I wanted to love these so bad because they are so flattering and comfortable but they arrived with a ripped seam in one spot and another area looks like it is about to rip....
3.0,Not going to wear them they so fake look like a kids put the patches on
3.0,Size not correctly described
3.0,Very lightweight which I was excited for but it doesnt hold its shape
3.0,It’s a beautiful scarf but It started to have strings peeling on the sides wasn’t very happy with that I would not recommend this.
3.0,"I really like the gem themselves, however the posts are plastic. The provided backs to the earrings are too small and whenever you try to put them on the post, the post bends and sometimes breaks."
3.0,"I like the material, it’s similar to t-shirt material, it’s nice."
3.0,Didn't like the elastic or fit. Unfortunately I had to send back. The price was great!
3.0,Size up from what the sizing chart says. Extremely thin.
3.0,Too large but will save for when she is bigger.
3.0,"They look nice, but you wouldn't wear them on a really cold day."
3.0,One shoe worked the other kept shorting out after only one day of use.
3.0,I have to put it on from the head as my but (reasonably sized) does not fit the waist. Looks ok once on.
3.0,The skirt was nice and soft the onesie was a little smaller than expected but the leg warmers did not fit at all on my chunky babies legs
3.0,"Pros: cute style, good fit<br />Cons: super thin shell-like material with no give, and fits like a maxi dress on my 5’3” frame."
3.0,"The plastic is pitted and ridged beyond hope of repair, the mold line was 1/4"" high and the visor was a flimsy plastic bit that scratched at the lightest touch.<br /><br />Still, it really tied my Space Gorilla (Sasquanaut) costume together well.<br />If you have the know-how and time I would suggest trying to make your own helmet instead. If not, this thing works decently well although I feel it is overpriced.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it's completely hollow so you'll need some sort of padding to keep your head positioned."
3.0,"light weight socks, good for summer?"
3.0,"Make sure you know your size. Ordered one for my wife but it was too long. Tried to return it but the seller makes you pay for return shipping, which is in Korea or something. So it’ll end up costing you more to return it than it’s even worth."
3.0,My son really likes the style of these shoes but the white NIKE design arrived somewhat yellowed out of the box. I considered returning them.
3.0,"I can recommend these with some reservations....they are thin and silky feeling, but  not see through. Very stretchy, but have NO compression in tummy, butt or legs . Definitely not ""tummy control"" leggings.  Comfy and adequate for hanging out, doing yoga and other home exercise activities. They  sort of feel like having nothing on, which is both good and bad!<br /><br />I am 5'3,  125 lb and ordered a small, which basically fit, but they seemed to feel a bit large due to lack of compression and thin stretchy fabric...not enough compression for running.  They are also a tiny bit long for my height.<br /><br />Would probably be good warmer weather or indoor leggings- especially for a slightly taller and tauter person than me!  Definitely no warmth for winter outdoor use, although would probably work great UNDER jeans, long  skirts or  other pants, as cold weather liners."
3.0,"The KIRUNDO casual knit split style maxi dress is soft, comfortable and has pockets. I received this dress in size large, and it fit true to size in American sizing. That made it too big for me because I am 5'3"", 117 lbs with a 36DD chest and would typically wear a size small in this type of knitwear (US sizing).<br /><br />It's a boxy cut and not especially flattering except that the extra fabric in the pockets adds a little shape to the hip area. Despite the crisp laser cut holes, it was a nothing type of dress that looked kind of frumpy on me. I don't need any help in that department at my age.<br /><br />I can usually make anything work, but I am at a loss with this dress because  It's doesn't even work as loungewear.<br /><br />I cinched it in back to get an idea of what this dress might look like if it were closer to the right size and it didn't look too bad.<br /><br />However, I am not a fan of maxi dresses, and the split front panel felt a bit annoying as I walked. It felt like I had to kick something out of my way with every step.<br /><br />The overall quality was decent, but this just wasn't the right style or size."
3.0,Very comfortable but it is sheer which surprised me given the reddish color
3.0,"thin fabric, cheap made, lots of loose threads.  Wish I had tried it on before washing it.  Won't ever wear it."
3.0,"Top fit great. Much like a sports bra...but those bottoms....unless you’ve never had kids and have a toned booty, and are ok showing the cheeks don’t waste your money. They look great in the front but are cut super narrow in the back. For reference I am 5’6”, 150 lbs and purchased a large."
3.0,"good product, but after I bought it I found several other sites that sell the same thing for 39.99, so I feel cheated. My own fault for rushing. Product well made and a lot smaller than I thought."
3.0,It’s hard to push up handle to open umbrella.
3.0,"They are really stylish-fun-different, but the size runs REALLY small. They did not have the style I wanted in the next size up :-( either."
3.0,Nice design but the material is too flimsy
3.0,"I read the reviews and ordered the XXXl based on my size which is 3x plus size. This runs small. It's more like a 1x so I'll be returning it. But I will say this is a very nice tunic for the price. It is a very sturdy material, made well, and would have been very flattering had it not been too small. I would still recommend it if it's in your size and I would've reordered if it came in a bigger size."
3.0,It's alright only wore it once
3.0,"I'm normally a s/m and the chains didn't hang well on my body. I'm returning it because of that. But it was nice thick chains, seemed to be durable."
3.0,For me it didn't fit right. I am mom with a toddler and I need to hide the stretch marks but also be able to chase and pick up my toddler without falling out the top of my suite. The shorts for perfect though.
3.0,"I liked the costume, but the mask is a little tight. I guess it’s not designed for fat people 🤣 It showed up rather quickly and in perfect condition."
3.0,Received the wrong color. Request black received dark navy blue.<br />Decided to just keep instead of returning
3.0,"If ourside and windy the shield flies up and defeats the purpose of wearing it. Works inside just fine. I went to a casino and the would not lem in without a mask so this also defeated the purpose. It works in some places but not others. But if it is accepted, its much less restrictive than a mask. I can actually breathe."
3.0,"They are quite fashionable and cute, but they were packages in a plastic bag... no box no hard case so they were a bit bent up by the time they got to me and I had to straighten them out quite a lot.  Other than that, a cute pair of shades, feels high fashion!"
3.0,"Sleeve cuffs/neck are poorly made. My husband pulled the sleeves up over his elbows and the sleeve cuffs stretched out way too much, and they will not return to normal (maybe they should put a little elastic in them to keep them tighter). The neck is already curling after 1 wash. I'm not sure how they'll look after a few more washings."
3.0,"I am not entirely happy with this dress. The front and back neclines are too deep and the colour is not a soft ballet pink, but a darker pink. Material is ok and its held up ok after 4 washes. The best part of the dress is the buttons at crotch area. This is super useful when they have to go to the bathroom. I bought this as it seemed like the most cost effective dress that also satisfied my daughter's needs."
3.0,Kept it but poss will not wear again can't get wrinkles out not even with iron
3.0,"Top looks like the picture and the material is nice, but it's not a very flattering piece."
3.0,The earrings do not pop as in photo but value for so many is good
3.0,"Not very flattering. They are large and very flat so they look weird. They do keep my ears warm, but are now fraying on one side where the stitching is coming undone."
3.0,"I made the mistake of ordering too small of a crystal jewel for my liking. The size I ordered is the size of a small freckle. The gauge size is correct, and the jewels are very clean and clear. This vendor was great! Fairly well pricing, kept me updated with shipping process, and was delivered on time,  DOWN FALL: if your like me having one nose ring shape preference, that means the other two are worthless to you. Nose ring shapes are L shaped, stud, and spiral."
3.0,"I like it alot and I'm going to keep it. However, where it says ""long"" robe and in the picture it comes down well below the knees,  it comes above my knees. Not short, but not long. But I like it anyway and going to keep it. Feels nice."
3.0,Great set works with Amy size glasses
3.0,Cheaply made and can only be used occasionally as it will fall apart with frequent use.
3.0,"This suit is flashy and beautiful on any skin tone. It fit perfectly and loved the high waist. Flaw, it got picky on 1st wear!"
3.0,Are 3 and cheap but they does not look as well as in images
3.0,"I would go a size up.  I was hoping the V-neck was a little lower so not to show under my button down shirts.  It also seems to ride up sometimes so I have to adjust by pulling the shirt back down.  Other than that, it's made with good quality."
3.0,"pretty dress, lightweight and flowy.  Strange cut around the bust area.  Rest of dress fit fine, but bust area didn't fit correctly."
3.0,"Ordered size large. Fit runs small and the sleeves are shorter than the photo. Unfortunately,1 I did not get it returned in time, so I am stuck with a shirt that doesn’t fit good. ...  I would also prefer a softer material"
3.0,"Hats are constructed from a material that not only looks good, it breathes as well. Shape of hat is a little troubling but will be good for day to day wear."
3.0,This did not fit and did not look right on me.  I returned it.
3.0,"It's ok. feels cheap, but looks acceptable. Had a few dents on the smooth part of the circle. OK for price.Looks ok from a distance."
3.0,"Very hard to put on.  First you push the hard plastic through the slot with great difficulty.  Then you line up the two hard plastic nubs over the appropriate slots and push.  Nothing happens, they won't go through. Then take a pair of needle nose pliers, position the nubs over the slots, put the pilers between the slots and squeeze, being careful not to grip your own skin.  Once they lock into place, it's great'  The band works fine, is comfortable and doesn't come loose at night.  I wonder if the guys in China who make this ever tried to use it?  The price was right, but I'd pay twice as much for one that was easy to put on."
3.0,"I really liked these.  At $2 I couldn't pass it up.  I bought two of these,  both broke right off.  They came in the mail today.  I gave one to my 16 year old daughter,  and as soon as she put it on it fell apart, and started unraveling (the lower braided part).  I thought maybe it could be just be that one so I gave her the other one and same thing.  Like I said,  I bought two so I paid $4 and they didn't even last but for a few seconds. These are really pretty though so I will probably try to glue them back together."
3.0,I bought these for my mom.  She says they are tight around her ankles.
3.0,"Lo devolví, lo compré por eror"
3.0,"Pretty cute, though the material is a rather shiny, polyester heavy blend. It hangs nicely, the color is beautiful but I don’t like the feel of the fabric enough to buy again."
3.0,This is a very cute tank. The problem I had with it is how it did not lay down against my skin around the arm holes on my chest. So I returned it.
3.0,Decal is not made to last
3.0,"Cute shirt, but I ordered this because I like the muted orange color. It’s a lot brighter in person and I’m definitely gonna be looking like a pumpkin 😑"
3.0,"This dress was gorgeous, flattering and absolutely what I wanted. However, it was completely see through, despite the lining in the skirt."
3.0,"Nice material, and just the right size. Got compliments on it too. The only problem is the tassel sits weirdly when the bag is zipped. It kinda juts out. I think it is because the drop is too short."
3.0,"Fashion, good frame. But! the paint already chipped"
3.0,So this runs small America size 20 so I got a 3x nope should have gone a size up.and the sleeves are super tight shame too cause the dress is beautiful
3.0,"Nice jacket, well made and I like it in every respect except sizing.  Not sure if I got one that is mis-marked or if just runs small.  If you buy the jacket, based on my experience, I'd order at least one size larger than usual."
3.0,"The ring does look like the photo.  However, the ring broke in half when attempted to adjust it."
3.0,"Belt held up my pants, so it worked. After only a few times wearing it I noticed the material around the eyelets began to fray."
3.0,Really cute and easy to use.  I wish the rose gold actually matched the watch but oh well.  Not really anybody will see the face and the clasp at the same time I guess.
3.0,"The dress came quickely but, it did not look much like in the image. The white on the skirt was too long and the skirt area was not puffed out enough. On the other hand it was made with very tough martial but need support to adjust the underskirt."
3.0,Not the best quality it looks like cheap fabric on the inside but you can’t tell if someone was about three feet away. It goes to mid calf and if you finagle it enough it will look like picture. Downside for me is it didn’t go to the length that it did on the model but that’s only because I’m short. (5’1)
3.0,Durable sandal but too big. Double check measurements before buying.
3.0,"Size up at least 3 sizes. Cute shirt and looks like quality material, maybe it’s kid sizes or something."
3.0,"I actually like the stress but it doesn’t look like the picture. It’s sort of a frumpy how stress and the pattern shows through. As an in parts where the material is double layered you see flowers showing through the white which looks strange and faded. But for the price I’m definitely going to wear it around the house,  I don’t hate it"
3.0,I'm happy with the fast deliver but I'm still search for more containers at a reasonable price. I did not realize there was only one cap per row.
3.0,You get what you pay for and this was an inexpensive robe with several problems. It has only two sizes S/M and M/L. I chose the M/L and it was huge. Need more sizes. There was no loop to hang the robe on a hook which is quite an ordinary thing to do and I did not see any pockets. I have since sent it back (customer service was excellent and quickly responded) so maybe I missed seam pockets. The color was not a nice pink and the fabric was nothing special. I will continue to look for a new all cotton robe.
3.0,"Finding myself in need of warmer hands as well, exposed fingers to allow for typing and fine motor coordination issues.  Having waited three years to provide feedback, each of the several pair ordered have worked perfectly for the climatic conditions intended.  Having chosen heavy, median, and light weaves, each for differing temperatures, each has performed their assigned tasks."
3.0,"They are very cute, but so short. I even ordered a size larger than I usually wear to compensate for how long my legs are. And they still hit me mid-ankle. If you have shorter legs, these are perfect!"
3.0,"These shoes are super high quality, I love them!  I was worried the sols would be too gushy, no way man the sols have good structure like a tennis shoe.  The looks is incredible as well, the materials are great and what a bargain.<br /><br />I can't believe the sizing, what the heck was dockers thinking?  The length is perfect, but my toe went numb almost right away.  They are way too tight even order a 1/2 size over my size.  I just will never purchase anything dockers again.  What is this woke shoe sizing?  Slippers so tight that would make skinny jeans fit loose?  What a shame, what a disappointment.  I will have to find some black elastic stuff like is on the sides, make a cut down the middle, and sew that in.  Shame on you dockers, this is not a close thing, there seams to be a new thing with trusted names to choke a mans feet.  never again<br /><br />Edit, not changing any rating, I am still disappointed.  However, I found a word around until I figure out how to widen these.  Take the orthodic out.  No this is a perfect situation, the heel feels a little funny without it, but the ortho is fairly large as you will see when you take it out.  I can now wear them, I will save the ortho's till a time when I can cut and sew them to fit.  Dockers fix this, look at the votes, not s ingle person said these are too large, which is expected in slippers.  5 people said they are too thin and 8 said the fit perfect, but no large votes.  Figure that out, this is a very bad look."
3.0,"The first time I wore this it was falling off, I think it partly may be because it was a little large. Prior to putting it on it felt very sticky. I typically fit into a standard B cup with not too much cleavage. This was bigger than other sticky cups I have purchased in the past. It is unfortunate that once you try it on you can't return it so it ended up being a waste of money for me. I wish I had gotten a smaller size to try it out."
3.0,"Dress is super cute and very nice, but the fit is confusing. It's quite stretchy and kind of on the tight side, which I wasn't expecting at a medium!"
3.0,"Liked when I first got it, but my gf only got to wear it for an hour before the cheap chain holding it together broke."
3.0,Looks nice and doesn’t look cheap only issue is that the wallet itself is big. Looks a bit weird that it is.
3.0,Not really as I expected. The colour is dull
3.0,"I LOVE the look of it. But it constantly gets caught on things and if it gets caught well enough, it bends and gets bigger. Bend it back, gets disfigured. The gold surface rubbed off and it started to turn me green. It's a nice ring to wear on occasion, but not for an every day ring, which is what I was looking for. Can't complain too much for the price I paid for it."
3.0,"Are used the size chart and ordered appropriately, however the shirts are about one size too small. They are a thin material, not super warm but good for layering"
3.0,"They arrived beautiful but bent the post was folded down flat, I guess for shipping. I wore them.once to a concert. The first was gone in about 30 minutes, post in ear, Angel wing gone, it broke off the post. I tightened the second, it felt fine but by the end it Was gone too lo ed them while they lasted glad they were cheap. They aRe very heavy and pretty big, they worked for my average ear, with long time pierced ears but if you have small ears or early piercings, they may be too much for you."
3.0,It looks so fake... not even worth for the prize .Good for just one time wear.Design wise I'm giving 4 stars.
3.0,Ordered a 4x -- I am a 1x and it was still too small. Very pretty dress but lots of stretch which does not flatter a xx person.
3.0,We love the outfit but after washing and hang drying it shrunk a significant amount. So now it's a bit too small. So buy a size big.
3.0,Took long time to receive.but nice pants
3.0,"I purchased this pendant to wear for vacation and the beach-no tragedy if it was lost.  I also read the entire description and knew that it came without a chain.<br />It is an attractive pendant in a nice setting.  It has a lot of sparkle too.  However, IMO, it is too large in size to ever convince someone that it is the real deal.<br />The price, if you look at it as a whole, not as something with a ridiculously high shipping fee, was fair.<br />I gave the pendant a three star rating due to the size, and being that I felt the size given in the description was inaccurate.<br />I would also like to add, after reading another review, the pendant that I received was also not what was pictured.  I would have much rather preferred the pendant that was shown, rather than what I did actually receive."
3.0,I purchased this for my niece and she said it was okay but she wishes it was bigger so that she can store more things in it.  That being said  I feel it could have been priced significantly lower since it doesn't have that much room for her things.
3.0,"my 10 YO daughter loves them.  cheap but not real jewelry, just a kids plastic toy.<br /><br />FYI She found a how to DIY on you tube for the same thing, and made a bunch more of her own from 2$ Wal-Mart magic stretch string."
3.0,My daughter said fitting not perfect.
3.0,Order size based on measurements....way too big in the chest and shoulders.
3.0,Eyes were not as blue as I expected. They were more white in color. It also seems as thought the bracelet was longer than 7 inches. Overall the bracelet was nicely made. Just not what I expected which made it just ok for me.
3.0,The fabric is kinda cheap in feel and quality. It does not entirely look as advertised.
3.0,Love this shirt but..<br />It runs a size too large<br />Ordering a smaller size although wish they had it in xs<br />Teen daughters is wearing it so it's getting cropped but even at her normal size shirt it's extremely long and wide<br />Would recommend just try size smaller<br />Ordered medium due to bust size
3.0,I bought this for shoulder support while working. Didn't work for me. Wouldn't stay in place.
3.0,"The lining came torn already, but my daughter loves running around as &#34;monkey&#34;"
3.0,Very nice design but sizing is very different than what I've become accustomed to in stores.
3.0,Runs small & fabric could have been softer
3.0,Not as warm as it looks. It's basically just a hoodie.
3.0,Nice shirt.  Not as flowy or lightweight as the picture seems.
3.0,Not as fancy as I anticipated but since I paired it with the bling heart key chain it looks much nicer. I wouldn’t rock it by itself and if you want to do that keep looking. It’s also small and feels like teddy bear faux fur. I wanted it to be softer and larger.
3.0,"The dress was way larger than expected (I did look at the measurements, but it's hard to guess properly, especially with stretchy vs non stretchy fabric). I usually wear a size small, which is what I ordered. I think the x-small would still be too large. Also, the zipper goes down the right side of the dress, which is atypical (doesn't really matter, but feels awkward)."
3.0,Like the quality but hat is small and the flag is really small snd hard to see the writing on it. Wish it was bigger.
3.0,The shoes twist sideways on my foot
3.0,"These suspenders were very nice.  I like the checkered design weave.  However, I had to return them because one of the clips would  not hold.  I wish I could have replaced them but the policy was no exchang, only return for refund."
3.0,I bought two of these as replacements for my Moving Comfort Fiona sports bras.<br />Pros: They look great and give nice shape and hold up nicely (at first).<br />Cons: -The loops that connect the straps to the bra in front don't have a great design. They should have been round but instead are long so they quickly twist and look weird.<br />-The bras seems to lose it's firm hold quickly and starts to sag on the first wear after purchase.<br />-The bras are not as supportive as my Moving Comfort bras and don't work well for high impact workouts.<br />-Both bras were kind of scratchy on the back. I  cut the tag out of one thinking that was it but it still scratches.<br />I really wanted these bras to work but unfortunately they don't.
3.0,Thicker sock than I thought so they bulk up in my peep toe shoes that I bought them for. And they show on the top of the foot. I will still wear with other flats but none of my peep toes work with them. I guess every shoe and sock are different on everybody so without being able to try them on first I can't give a positive review.
3.0,I like the fit but wow the elastic is super tight for plus size and there is no way to loosen it. Bought for sleeping but it annoys me so much I just wear around the house. Fabric is soft.
3.0,"This is a beautiful piece of jewelry, although it is very dainty and fragile. Mine broke within a week of owning it. Loved it while it lasted."
3.0,"I really really love the design of this swimsuit, but it is way too big and I have to return it. I felt sexy and confident in it, but it was falling off of me. The bottoms are cute but they were so big and offered no tummy control and came up to the middle of my back.  If a smaller size were in stock I would definitely exchange it for that. I need a size 14 and they sadly don’t have it available. Very flattering swimsuit, I just wish it fit."
3.0,"These workout pants have a modern tapered fit that's flattering to a well-formed physique. This also means that they run just a bit smaller than standard fit items but this is to be expected with this type of styling. Their more fitted look is why they look good. That said I also have to point out some less than stellar features as well. The material of the garment, described by the manufacturer as a mostly cotton blend, does not impress me as of particularly high quality. It's interesting to note BTW that the Amazon page for these describe them as 69% cotton-26 polyester-5 spandex; yet a careful search of the tags on the garment upon arrival don't give any indication of the materials from which it's made nor the percentage of each in its construction. This gives me considerable phase; I like to have the details of exactly what I'm wearing spelled out on the item itself. Not having that makes me suspicious of the omission. The best I can say about the material is that it's at best a mid-grade textile of the sort you'd find at big discount retailers. I ordered the black pair with red accents down the sides. Thing is, these accents include what looks like a heat-pressed black synthetic strips on red clothe that previous experience suggests is likely to peel and crack soon enough. Washing these pants inside out and either line-drying them or putting them on low in a machine dryer should retard this likely scenario but that's not what I anticipated when I ordered them. They're not particularly expensive and potential buyers might what to order a pair just because they look good, but I most emphatically disagree with another reviewer here who claimed that the quality of these workout pants are equal to well-known brands that typically cost several times more than these. Bottom line for me is that if you're looking for a good looking garment at a lower price and are ok with comparably lower quality than many other brands then this can work for you. Just remember that you get what you pay for."
3.0,"the fabric was very thin, but its comfortable."
3.0,"From reviews and the description I thought it would be soft like leggings/joggers - its more like work out clothing/swimsuit/dry wick type material. It was not comfortable for a daily wear like what I was hoping for, more just for the workout itself.  I am 5'4 and these were almost highwaters for me! Would not work for a tall person."
3.0,You get what you pay for.  Will be using more as a beach coverup than a cute black shirt.  It's a little long and quality is just ok.  I wouldn't buy again.
3.0,"It fit a little tighter than I was expecting. I even got a bigger size than I normally do. Couldn’t zip it up, quite sheer so you have to wear the right kind of underwear. I like the look of it and I’m hoping to be able to lose some weight so that I can wear it this summer."
3.0,"I order this shirt in a large, the large size is actually a small, the shirt is beautiful,so I gave it to my niece, so if you want a large you might need to order two sizes up."
3.0,"Bought this purse and cancelled because I missed one day delivery. Went out came back home to a gift at my door anyways!! Best unboxing and reveal to my fiance. I'm a new fiancee and I'm expecting. This is the look I am trying to achieve, in PINK. congrats to the designer, thank you thank you thank no flaws or broken straps and very well crafted and designed. My bag came with a vanilla scented bag insert. Freshness please (: I put my breathable bag in the smaller pink wallet. I'm in love with my new set. Future purse buyer &lt;3 hope to enjoy the life of my new girl"
3.0,Runs a little smaller than true size.
3.0,Would've been perfect had the stitching been aligned properly.
3.0,"After wearing the first pair out of the pack on the first day, a hole showed up on the heel. Not happy with that. They are comfortable and stayed up on my calf. Second pair going on today. If another hole shows up, I will update this review.<br /><br />UPDATE&#62;&#62; It was only the one sock with a hole and all the rest have been very comfortable and held with multiple washings."
3.0,"So the good things about this dress is the pattern and style and the length. The things that did not work for me are the bust area (the lining I that area made my busy look funny), no elasticized smocking in the back so no give if you have a larger bust, and the material of the dress is not cotton so not very breathable on a hot summer day/night. If you are between sizes 16/18 the size XX-large will fit a bit snug (runs slightly small)."
3.0,The boning poked out after first wear. Doesn't feel well made.
3.0,It's cute just can't be slouchy or caught with bad posture lo it has a t back! Lots of side boob
3.0,But broke very fast on my wedding day
3.0,It just didn't work for me. The neck was very tight!
3.0,Gummies are just ok. Not worth $30 for a fairly decent flip flops that are not really compfy. They are flat and not really padded like my cheap old Addidas flip flops.
3.0,I have not yet had a chance to wear this belt. I ordered several at one time and when they arrived the odor coming from the box was so strong I could not keep it in the house. I had to take the belts outside to air our for about 3 days before I could stand to keep them in the house. I am hoping to be able to wear them soon.
3.0,The dress is beautiful and well made. A light and airy dress but not true to size  runs a little small
3.0,"The dress is really cute and  pretty flattering  The blue color is nice and vibrant.  The fabric is pretty shear and lightweight.  I am 5'4"" and 170 lbs and ordered the Large and it fit very nicely.  In the end, I returned this dress because I felt I would need too many undergarments to make it not too see through for my comfort."
3.0,I had to add a chain/ribbon bc it's super short for such a large chain. But the color is beautiful
3.0,"I liked the big screen size for for quick easy reference when flying airplanes. And its cheap. That said, it is ucomfortable on the wrist due to cheap materials, and screen quickly scratches."
3.0,"As a high viz garment, it is perfectly fine.  As a sweatshirt it's not warm or even very comfortable and the wind blows right through the polyester so wear it over a real hoodie or jacket and you'll be fine, but you can't wear this instead of one."
3.0,Small fitting. Does not fit 20y/o sister well. Looks nice but fitting a problem.
3.0,Light and flowy. Making some modifications to make it the correct 'luna' color and I have to add wrist bands. What I expected for the price.
3.0,"I purchase these to replace an old warn out pair of 100% cotton thermal Long Johns. It's been pretty cold around here (Michigan Winter 2023). when I 1st wore them, I could feel the cold breeze, right thru them. My traditional Thermal Long Jonhs, were significantly warmer.<br />I do, however like how comfortable  they are, but not a replacement for thermal underwear in very cold temperatures. (29degrees or colder)<br /> This is wearing them under Blue jeans."
3.0,I followed the sizing chart and they were way too big. Gave them away
3.0,I didn't realize this was the actual size.  Very small.
3.0,"Nice for the price but not thick enough for my needs. If you do not need a thick leather band, this one is good."
3.0,Heart came off after 3days and after that it feel apart
3.0,Much bigger than I expected. Doesn’t fit right around head will probably blow off in wind even worth my ponytail thru it. Love the color though.
3.0,"Generally product is ok quality. However I think all the reviews were very misleading. I'm petite, normally wearing size S/XS when I read review it was saying product comes smaller sizes so I ordered size L. It's waaaaay too big for me it looks like regular size L to me so be safe and order your true size as it really comes out as regular sizing."
3.0,"Kinda flaky, and was a little smaller than I thought it would be."
3.0,The charm itself is very pretty but is cheaply made (to be expected) and the necklace broke the first day without me even wearing it out. I tried it on and if fit like a choker. My advice would be to buy the necklace strictly or the charm (if it is the $3 or so one)
3.0,Muy pequeños.
3.0,"I love the design on this shirt. It's a nice thick t-shirt material that fits really great. My only problem was that after one wash, some of the print melted and stuck to itself. I was able to unpeel the shirt, but the design did come off in some areas. It's a shame, really, as I loved the print and how it looked. It's still wearable, but the design looks distressed now as it's peeled and melted off in places. I took a chance with this purchase (there were no reviews) because I loved the shirt, but I am just a bit disappointed that it did not hold up on the first wash."
3.0,Mediocre cheapest  was not expect as junky
3.0,They are very thin and comfortable for wearing but the open ends are too wide for them to be worm without additional support to hold them up for mask use.
3.0,Seem fake
3.0,"they're all a little off center, but they weren't expensive so I guess you get what you pay for, other then that they're pretty."
3.0,"Although the individual items were as described by seller, the assortment of colours and patterns were not. I received 12 lace short panties with 5 of them being black with the same pattern and even the 2 beige were the same pattern. The seller indicated that same colour items would have different patterns but this was not so. The fit was a bit small."
3.0,"the glasses work well and the lenses do not have any flaws or ripples.  My only complaint is they only work for objects inside of 18&#34; from your eyes.  I would like to have had intermediate range 18&#34;-48&#34; so that I can use them for my computer.  As it is they work well when reading a book, viewing my tablet or phone."
3.0,"Arrived and one of the stones fell out of one. The others are fine. Also, the shaft on them are a little small and sometimes I feel if I’m not careful it will come out. I would like the damaged one to be replaced but pointless to send back for just one."
3.0,They can shrink x 3 times original size when washed!!! depending on the color. Very confusing!
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:fae93031bd6727999975391cae120d9d]] This is a gorgeous and well-made swimsuit except for the fact that they used cheap fabric to begin with. Sadly, the bold and colorful print was printed onto plain white fabric. If the fabric has to stretch AT ALL (as many swimsuits do) it exposes the tiny ribs in the fabric that did not get print color causing it to appear faded in patches. I cannot justify keeping an expensive swimsuit that appears faded on first wear."
3.0,"I love this, it's very comfortable but it turns me blue, even after multiple washings."
3.0,"I immediately fell in love with everything about this skirt upon first sight. The color, the pattern, the high waist, the matching belt, etc. However upon arrival I found that the actual fit of the skirt was not flattering on my body at all. The belt fit oddly and found that the skirt by itself did not look as good either. Normally I am quite good at hacking things and making them work some way, especially with clothes. However, I am having a hard time thinking of exactly how I will do it with this skirt. I ordered this in a size Medium and found that it fairly loose. If you are someone who has a small waistline and wide hips you may find this skirt to be rather unflattering."
3.0,I bought these to wear on the 4th of July.  They are an ok flip flop but not the most comfortable.  The matierial doesn't bend very well and there is no arch support.  They were inexpensive but not my go to shoe.
3.0,It is a very pretty band and matches well with my apple watch (rose) but it is either too tight or too big. You can remove links but theres no other adjusting besides that and the watch must be on your skin to work properly.
3.0,"I read some previous reviews (since deleted) and saw complaints that the costume was too small. So I ordered a large.<br /><br />What I got was a costume twice as wide as I am and somehow still too short. I was able to safety pin everything in place where it’s too big, but I still can’t lift my arms without the extremely high inseam right up my butt. Please design costumes for women who are more than five feet tall."
3.0,"not a good cut for women with larger bellies. I am typically a large or XL. I ordered an XL and it’s much too tight at my stomach. I look pregnant in it. I’m not pregnant. It is cute, though."
3.0,"La talla es muy grande, yo uso usualmente M y compre una S y aun así es grande."
3.0,Too thin and lint balls after the first wash.
3.0,This is a cheap fabric with the most narrow sleeves! This makes the cut outs cut into your arm...not at all attractive!
3.0,Very cheap material. You get what you pay for I guess.
3.0,"I'm going to give a 3 star because not happy with the color. In the picture it's a nice yellow and the color description does specify YELLOW. The color is actually ORANGE. The jacket overall is very soft and very cozy, not for the winter cold days and don't size-up unless you like it baggy. Not happy with the color, but I will figure it out."
3.0,"As they say in business school, when a customer says &#34;Your price is too high&#34; we really mean &#34;I don't understand the value proposition.&#34;  Well, I don't understand the value proposition of this product."
3.0,"Cute idea, but runs small and has very little give for anyone that isn’t built extremely slim"
3.0,It fits perfectly. And the bling is amazing!!
3.0,I loved the skirt but ran very small.
3.0,"Sizing is off, one was way too big & one way too tight."
3.0,"Lovely colour , very good quality of the material but the  dress did not fit a expected.."
3.0,Me queda grande no se ajusta tanto
3.0,"It is not this light baby blue color, even in the sun. It is darker than pictured. Other than that I thought is was a great find for 10 bucks if you like this style."
3.0,"The foam that keeps it from rubbing on your forehead fell off immediately, but the rest of it held together long enough for my grandson to Treat or Trick for 2 hours.  Pretty inexpensive costume it you have a dark color hoodie and sweatpants."
3.0,"They are really cute, and very comfortable but they are not going to be supportive for any type of workout where there is bouncing involved. I won't wear them for impact workouts but I will definitely wear them for casual use under a lot of my dressy tank tops or when I do weights. They are very stretchy and thinner than most sports bras."
3.0,"Just received, the wallet does not feel like any kind of quality leather at all, especially for the cost, very disappointed. As everyone else mentioned its extremely hard to retrieve your drivers license from its slot. I had no problems with the snap staying closed as I don't carry loads of stuff."
3.0,The coloring is off from the photo.  It is more red/green than pink.  The fit is more snug than loose based on the sizing.
3.0,Really pretty but crappy. The dangly piece broke off after one day of wearing it.really annoying
3.0,Cute design and very soft. I fit in Old Navy women's large and this is probably equivalent to a Old Navy size Medium.
3.0,pretty design just ordered a big size but pretty and oh one of the button was defective
3.0,"Se salen al poco tiempo las varillas, lo cual hace que desechemos el producto"
3.0,"It was beautiful. I loved the look of this watch. Unfortunately it had to be returned. The links didn't hold together well. I don't know if it was specific to the one that I purchased it, or if it's a flaw in manufacturing. Mine was only worn for a couple of days and would just fall apart out of nowhere."
3.0,little tight but will give as gift to someone else.
3.0,"I’m writing this review approximately 26 days after purchasing the item. While it’s tiny and pretty, It will start rusting or rather turning copper after less then a month of wearing it. Sad too because it’s a really pretty necklace :/"
3.0,"A small 3X shirt, so buy it the next size up, if you’re a big guy."
3.0,"Too small , I am size small and this outfit is too small"
3.0,The colors are bright then the pictures
3.0,The bottoms were like mom bottoms and didnt really match the top.
3.0,"Love the Coat. Very nice quality, but it is way too small.  My daughter wears a size Medium in everything she wears, but I ordered it in a large. It was still too small. We were very disappointed because she was going to wear it for Christmas. We reordered in a XXL. I hope it fits. Sizing is definitely not on point. She is a size 7/8, but because the Large was so small we didn't think even the XL would fit. Will let you know"
3.0,"I ordered the &#34;blue&#34; color but consider it grey, as you can see in the photo online. I wear size 8, am 5' tall, and it's a little loose, but I kept the Medium because it's their smallest size. I also have the &#34;wine&#34; color. They still look nice after 3 or 4 washings, so I will order the charcoal color too.  I wear these to the gym over a black stretch T-shirt and black gym shorts"
3.0,"Haven't worn a lot, just a couple times."
3.0,"The design of the bag is good, but I found  myself a little confused by the way the charging port is suppose to work. I imagine that I’d need a charging power bank, but the cord provided isn’t working well for me in terms of putting it through the designer opening.<br /><br />Additionally, the faux leather situation is giving the bad a weird smell. Hopefully it’ll wear off with time.."
3.0,The black on the top faded after one wash.
3.0,"I ordered 12-18 months. This sweater is like 5T. But it is nicely made, soft and the right color. So I will keep it  because although my son is too small for it now he can wear it when he gets older."
3.0,Small. For small girls.
3.0,im a 34DD and a size 6/8 in pants. i saw that everyone recommended to size up so i did. i got the xxl (us size 10).... and it is still a very small suit. i still love it and can wear it but it is tiny and doesn't cover much. so just keep that in mind when shopping
3.0,"I bought this to wear under backless shirts.  It will work for that.  I had to take out the padding since if I left it in and put the shirt on my boobs looked deformed.  I paid two buck for it, so I really only expected it to last for two wears!  I am on wear four; but it is definately worth what I paid for it!!!"
3.0,It's about a size or two too big. It also looks like it would be a bit see through in the light. Other than that it's a very nice dress.
3.0,"I actually ended up returning this but only because it didn't fit like I hoped.  It was just too loose and just hung off my body.  It was super soft though,  loved the material! Just wish it fit tighter to my body."
3.0,The rags work fine. However the caps are big from the start and also easily stretch. The wraps also got seems in them after use. Still ok but wouldn’t buy again.
3.0,"The dress is very full and easy to put on, a little on the big side. This would work for a slimmer, younger person. The overwhelming heaviness of the lace kind of ages the whole thing. When you have this dress on, it looks like it's wearing you."
3.0,"They are nice and dont look cheap but the supplier does not  have quality control, one of the stones in the ring was missing and the ring was too big, its a shame, otherwise It would have been great."
3.0,"Nice shade of peach and utilitarian, but unattractive boxy and voluminous fit and unpleasantly rough texture (after one washing.) Hope it gets softer. If not, I won't wear it. I had a soft waffle robe, so I know that it's possible."
3.0,Little to large in the front for me.
3.0,I get compliments all the time. Took FOREVER to get here and a stone was missing
3.0,was not what i expected. not well made. The more i tried to shrink the worth it was
3.0,Quality is ok but it gathers lint quite easily so I wont purchase again
3.0,The dress was so wrinkled ironing wouldn’t take out the wrinkles.
3.0,"They Are adjustable, but not by much.  They're rigidity prevents major adjustments and I'm afraid for my Picasso face that's what I require.  I ended up having to get Rx glasses because my right eye is +1.0 worse than my left and has an astigmatism, making OTC readers insufficient for my needs.<br /><br />These still work in a pinch and keep them in the bathrooms for when I need to clip nails or relax in the tub.  If you are someone who can wear glasses right off the rack without adjustments, go for it.  They're lightweight and not bad looking.  I purchased them because they were a welcome relief from the half-glass cat-eye trend.  If you generally need to fiddle with your glasses for a good fit then skip these and try the LifeArt glasses.  Those are heavier but they're adjustable and have nose pieces for further manipulation."
3.0,I wish i could have picked out the bars because some of them ill never wear. The metal also seems quite large but the fit was good. I probably will just stick to the plastic balls though.
3.0,"Liked this sunglasses very much at first few months. but after that, the coating or thin films on two lens started peeling off along the frames, and the peeled off area kept enlarge.  This glass is good looking and very clear, just did not last a year."
3.0,"It runs big and cheaply made, I feel like if I would've spent $20 more I could've gotten better quality. Shop around, decided to keep since we opened the bag late...still an elf costume I guess. Not super bad but not the best quality."
3.0,Didn’t come with hat as described
3.0,"The bracelet itself is nice, but the silver bead with the rose or lightning streak on it rubs off very quickly.  It turns a copper/rose color.  Had hardly worn it before it started turning.  It isn't made for everyday wear."
3.0,It tends to slide up on ya head.  Nice look thou!
3.0,"I ordered this for my soon to be 1 year old in 12-18 months and it was huge on her but it fit her cousin perfectly so I gave it to them and ordered a 6-9 month and a 9-12 month. The 6-9 months fit her perfectly but there was no elastic in the left leg and the 9-12 months ties untie and are missing a snap in both sides of the crotch. There's just a hole where the snap should be on both sides of the fabric. In any case, I love the soft stretchy fabric so much! I'm going to repair them myself because I've already washed and tried them on her and I was lax in not inspecting them prior to washing them. So, just a heads up to customers: inspect the garment before removing the tags and washing."
3.0,The material is very flimsy and thin. It also comes smaller to its size...better size up at least of your regular size so you’ll have a more comfortable fit. Color is the same vibrant blue.
3.0,"Didn't realize it didn't have pockets -- my bad, since I want to use it for golf."
3.0,"Nicely  done and good looking but has a hollow back so if using for dress it is fine but for every day wear in ""costume"" it gets turned around from time to time and shows the hollowed out back. Would have been better double sided"
3.0,Thank you for helping me getting this bag.
3.0,Low quality shirt not worth the price tag
3.0,This arrived with a big gouge in the handle but it still works and it's not worth the trouble to send it back.
3.0,"appears much cheaper than in the pics... its a jersey knit blend... ok for everday use with sandals but not something I would wear for a semiformal or work event... the material looks almost like the outer side of thin sweatpants... ran me about 1 size too small, as a tight fit... definitely account for 2 sizes small on the safe side."
3.0,"This is cute and displays jewelry nicely. Too me, its not the greatest quality, but it's good enough and my 17 yr old daughter likes it."
3.0,"Wasnt as warm as they said they were, I have raynauds syndrome and my finger tips get very cold easily, these did not keep the cold out after about being out in them for 15 minutes.  They are bulky so working out in them is harder to pick things up with them"
3.0,"Wish they were made for size 10 feet.  I took a chance that they would work, but too short.."
3.0,nice earring but very hard to get close especially on the small ones
3.0,"These masks were adorable. Colors and pictures were as described.  The adult size is very large and they fell off my face. I tightened them as much as my ears could handle and the mask rested right under my lower eye lid and covered well past my chin. If you order them, order the child size."
3.0,Looks better on the internet than in person....
3.0,"I'm 5'9.5, 10 pants, 12 blouse, 34D bra. My arms and inseam are typical, I used to be a fit model for a women's tall size 8 - all measurements had to be EXACT for that size (20 yrs ago). This turtleneck came 2' above my wrist and the body was very short - didn't cover the narrow waistband on HIGH waist jeans.  It was also very tight under the arms, at the chest, lots of wrinkles from being too tight.  I really liked the packaging, it looked high end, the fabric was soft, but the neck was too loose, short, and flimsy.  Definitely unable to stand it up, which is my preference. I used to buy C&C turtlenecks, loved the long arms and neck on a COTTON or cotton spandex turtleneck. Still looking for a replacement and C&C California which is no longer in business."
3.0,This scarf was a pretty color but was kinda thin.
3.0,These are good shirts - but cut very small. Order a size larger
3.0,"It says for men or women, but it's definitely for women. I'm a man. It's a nice necklace, it really is, just looks too feminine so I'm gonna have to give it to my sister"
3.0,"Fabric is thin, runs short"
3.0,"This dress (and other styles) have beautiful prints.  They are pretty and soft.  I am so disappointed that I had to send 3 (different prints) back because the torso is way too tight.  I am a Large in most clothing (12-14), but these fit like a Medium (or size 10).  If you have an &#34;apple shape&#34; or have a wide back, the Large will not fit.  I am hoping they consider adding an XL some day so I can buy them again.  My advice is to buy one and see how it fits first. They really are pretty and reading other reviews, they appear to fit other people.  Give it a try!  Maybe you will have better luck!"
3.0,The top wasn’t what I expected. It’s very thin
3.0,"Soft fabric, runs small, order one size larger than what you wear."
3.0,Letters peeled of quickly
3.0,Feels great when you have the one. But same thing they shrunk cold water is recommended.
3.0,Earrings open up while wearing lost one the second day wearing them
3.0,".5,.6 and .7mm screws are common in most movements and nothing smaller than 1mm here."
3.0,"Purchased as a flower girl dress for a 3yo at a wedding, and while it didn't last it certainly did its job when it counted!  I recommend pinning the bow on AFTER you get it on its wearer, but do the flowers first!  I also wouldn't expect this to be something she wears over and over, so take care with it and minimize the number of times she wears it if you can.  I ordered a size up (4T instead of 3T) since my daughter is TALL for her age (38&#34; tall at 3yrs 1 month old, and 4T starts at 39&#34;).  The dress fit well though the train dragged on the ground in front of her and tripped her on occasion.  I wouldn't have expected it to be as long as it was even with the up-sizing.  The other little girl at the wedding in a similar dress did not have this issue.  She had about 3-4&#34; to spare in the front train, and my daughter's was about 2-3&#34; too long.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- This dress fit well, and was as pictured.<br />- The color (pink) was beautiful and definitely comparable to the picture.<br />- It is beautiful on - the bride that requested we buy this LOVED it, and the other little girl in a matching dress looked beautiful in hers too!<br /><br />Con:<br />- The train was a little long and my daughter kept tripping on it.  I sized up because she was between the top of 3T and the bottom of 4T.<br />- The flowers and bow were attached to safety pins which you need to attach to the dress yourself<br />- The flowers fell off the safety pins after ~2 hours, and eventually the bow did too.  I recommend securing them with better pins or gluing/sewing them on.<br />- The zipper damaged the dress each time I used it - getting caught in the threads and tearing them."
3.0,they're great at first but they are pretty much a no go after about 2 months of barely using. But the design is fine and the lights are bright. Theyre pretty cool.
3.0,"The dress is fine for a one time wear or costume, but doesn't wash or dry well, even on low heat, and the lace is very delicate. It's not valuable enough to dry clean, but not well made enough to wash normally."
3.0,"I had to get xx Large because of how wide my hand is, but the finger is about 1” to long so it is hard to pick up anything. They are good for the cold, but nothing likely is advertised, I was outside for about 1 hr the temperature was 20 degrees and my fingers started getting cold. Not to bad for the price."
3.0,"Yet another &#34;spare&#34; chess clock.  This is the second revision of this review, after owning the clock for about 6 months.<br /><br />For now, this has been demoted to a club only clock for blitz or fast time controls.  I'll bring a Chronos or a DGT to any really serious tournament.<br /><br />The problem is that the clock has dumped my saved custom time controls several times now.  There are two spots where you can save these.  One will take a modified form of any of the other time controls; the other will only save a time control with Fischer increment, but you can have up to four time periods.  These are supposed to be saved for as long as the battery is good, and in fact are supposed to survive if you remove and replace the battery very quickly (they don't).  In fact though, I've found that after a few weeks, both of these saved time controls revert back to zero even with the clock just sitting on the shelf.  I tested the battery with an external battery tester, and it was good, but just to be sure, I replaced it anyway.  After a little less than a month, I took the clock out for some blitz games today and found it had dumped my custom controls again.<br /><br />It's easy enough to set up a custom time control in about a minute, and I haven't had a problem actually come up during a game.  I did use it in one five round tournament with a custom control, and it lasted for those three days.  The 37 manufacturer defined presets don't get dumped, and there are enough of them that you can easily find any chess time control you would need, or modify a preset to get it.<br /><br />This could have been a two star review.  On the other hand, if the clock only dumps its memory intermittently when it is turned off, but is okay while turned on, it is usable, and actually has a number of good points.  Very clear display.  Hours, minutes, and seconds show at all phases of the game; you don't have to wait to get under a certain amount of time to see the seconds ticking down.  Shows the delay countdown clearly.  Simple operation, and despite not being all that well written, the manual is comprehensible.<br /><br />Other clocks with a longer track record are probably a better choice for now.  It's possible that I just got the one bad one.  Although I was past the return period, I did contact the seller to see if there was a warranty.  There isn't one.  I emailed the maker at the address in the instruction booklet.  No answer.  When (if) other people post reviews, we'll have a better idea how this is working out in general.  So far, mine is the only one I've seen at tournaments.<br /><br />EDIT, 7/14/19.  I've been taking this to our local club for blitz games.  After checking  a couple of times to see how long it takes to dump the manually set time controls, I believe that it's a consistent 4 weeks (or actually about 29 days).  That still sounds like a bug rather than a feature, but it's something you can work with by setting your custom time controls not too long before a tournament."
3.0,"There was an extra ruffle on the arms but I cut it out easily. Not very flattering thought, a little boxey. I bought an XL, could have gone down a size."
3.0,"First, I want to state that I am an adult and bought this band for myself. I liked that this band was fully adjustable because I have a small wrist and other Fitbit bands have not fit and/or hurt my wrist. This band looks entirely silver in the picture. However, it is not entirely silver. It came with a sliver band, but the parts that connect to the actual Fitbit are white. So aesthetically, this band is not very pleasing. But it does work fine and it's cheap. I'd consider buying another company's band in this style next time to see if I can actually get it in silver..."
3.0,Length was as expected and material is nice. The problem is it doesn't shown the horizontal line/scrunch it has in the back. Otherwise it would have been perfect.
3.0,Cute but chain broke with on little tug. New chain and tank charm is fine.
3.0,"I am basically happy with the charm.  However, the loop that holds the stone and the loop that holds the jump ring are a little frail.<br />I am wearing it as a charm on a bracelet so I'm a little worried about daily wear and tear in the long.<br />Other than that I'm perfectly happly.  I would recommend this product."
3.0,"Okay pearls- they are reasonably priced, but nothing spectacular."
3.0,"Love the feel of the material and love that the are cozy and comfy. What I did not like is that the design on the top is that iron on rubbery stuff and shouldn’t be dried in the dryer. I ruined the top the first time I dried it because the design stuck to another part of the design and when I pulled it apart it tore a piece of the design off. I hadn’t even worn them yet.  Pajamas should be wash, dry and wear and not need special care and treatment in my opinion. So if you don’t mind special care then they are great."
3.0,It was ok. Nothing special
3.0,Length of pants were much shorter than expected
3.0,A little flimsy but adequate. Good price.
3.0,Well I love the band EXCEPT that it wont stay clipped in on the sides. It randomaly unclips itself and has caused it to fall FACE FIRST on the sidewalk or street while I am doing stuff. I have been lucky so far but it makes me sad cause I like the design and how the bond latches but the clip to the physical watch just wont stay clipped.
3.0,Okay nose rings for the price
3.0,"I purchased this strap after my official Jawbone strap broke after 9 months of use. I never had issues with the Jawbone strap falling off like other people have reported, but the Moretek strap seemed like the superior design, and I wanted to avoid another Jawbone strap since the first one just seemed like such a poor design choice.<br /><br />While I appreciate that Moretek used the tried-and-true clasp design (rather than making a failed attempt at designing the Watch Latching Mechanism Of The Future), this strap fails in new ways where the Jawbone strap succeeded. I agree with several other reviewers who mentioned that the UP pops out of the strap very easily. I nearly lost my UP within the first week or two of using this strap, which never happened with the original Jawbone strap. This strap is also uncomfortable. I was accustomed to the thin Jawbone strap, which wrapped neatly around my wrist and didn't feel bulky or clingy. When adjusted to a reasonable length to fit my wrist, the Moretek strap clings uncomfortably to me. I can adjust it to be larger and larger, with each notch doing nothing to improve the cling situation, until it's so large that it flops around my wrist like a sticky bangle and I can nearly slide it over my hand without unlatching it. (Note that making it excessively large greatly increases the chances it will get caught on something, twist, and cause the UP to pop out.)<br /><br />I have no idea why I find this strap so uncomfortable compared to the original strap, but I wish I did. The width might be part of the problem, and perhaps offering a narrower band would improve the situation. Using an ever-so-slightly less flexible material might help as well -- both to keep the UP attached to the band, and to help the band keep its own shape, rather than flattening and chafing itself around my wrist.<br /><br />I've all but stopped using my UP because of the all-around lack of good band choices. Maybe if I want a more comfortable wearable or more aftermarket accessory choices, I need to buy a more expensive device in the first place..."
3.0,Not very good strapless bras
3.0,"It is amazingly soft, it is very warm. The problem with this product is the stitching. Several hems are already separating, even before I wore it. One pocket wasn't even fully sewn.<br /><br />So great fabric, horrible sewing."
3.0,Took a couple of days to break in.  Second pair to replace first that finally wore out.
3.0,tyyyyyyyyyyy
3.0,Short torso and arms. Plenty wide around. Fit kind of short and fat. Not my favorite.
3.0,Very pretty just don’t like the way it open and closes first pair returned the lock was broken
3.0,"My glasses arrived broken, but I love them so I will try again."
3.0,"The producy is good, but the package was not. the flag pins are a small item however the package was suited for something hard-cover book size. The package should suit the product."
3.0,"They are ok, just feel they are of a cheaper material then I would expected, but it was a good deal for what they are."
3.0,Not good craftsmanship. Easily comes apart while wearing.
3.0,"A bit wide even when i adjust the straps. But otherwise, nice and comfy."
3.0,"There's a lot going on with this cover up. I think it's too big for a small person. When I try to tie it, there's a lot of overlap. I'm 5'8 34c, usually wearing size 2/4.  Lots of material/movement in the arms also, if that's your thing you'll love it."
3.0,Nice dress but the material is thick.
3.0,Was bigger than expected . Clamp end was rough on the skin.
3.0,It runs small and the material is flimsy.
3.0,"The sweatshirt is great. It's long and not to thick, BUT it runs VERY small. I ordered a 4x hoping for a oversized sweater. It barely fit me. So just keep in mind to order up."
3.0,"I had this dress in blue, so i decided to buy the black. The material is not thick as their dresses are known for and after 3 washes the color has faded. I give it a 3. I hope they go back to the thick material & dyes that withstand mutliple washes - that is why i loved purchasing from them, but wasn't so happy with this 1."
3.0,Size up. I ordered 3x but its not a true 3x
3.0,The snaps pop open with even the slightest pressure. Other than that I really liked it.
3.0,i was hoping for a more silvery white version of ivory.  when it came in it was a grey/ beige color.  not bad color but just not anything like the color i was wanting
3.0,Wasn't to happy with this necklace but my daughter love's it
3.0,Theses are cute but very small for my face shape I love the oversized ones better .
3.0,"It is a really pretty piece and my daughter likes it. However, the balance on it is just a little off... so it lays a bit off kilter on her neck. I would really love it if it hung better."
3.0,"Good funky socks. They are not very soft/ cozy, but definitely have a a classic art theme."
3.0,"This runs small and is thin material. I usually wear a medium, but bought in medium and large to allow for any funky sizing. The large is too small, so I didn't even bother taking the medium out if the bag. Will have to return both."
3.0,"This dress is very thin, very much like a stretchy T=shirt.  Washed well, but wrinkled in the dryer.  Will not buy again."
3.0,Yeah I bought this hat for sun blocking and it doesn't do that good of a job doing that !! The flap that supposed to cover your neck and ears are way too small to do a good job ( I should have trusted the reviewer prior to me lol) it literally doesn't cover your ears at all and the flap that hangs in the back is not a soft material it has cardboard it it which makes it very firm!! Other that that it fit very well and I think the color scheme is nice!! Everybody at work said I looked like Sherlock Holmes from the Scotland Yard lol
3.0,"I like the dress alot. But the material was like a polyester and it made the dress unappealing. The kind of material that shows the outline of your bra, underwear, and any body imperfections."
3.0,Did not look like online but not extremely bad I guess. Lense were pink not red.
3.0,The silver chain is very fragile. Broke within 2 weeks. The part with the children’s names are nice. I would suggest getting a different chain.
3.0,Runs a bit big. Nothing special.
3.0,"Isn't a bad strap, but the product in not good quality."
3.0,"Cute, light weight, a little cheap feelings, but it was so inexpensive that this is expected."
3.0,The material stretches I suggest you get a size one sizes under your normal
3.0,Quality of rayon blend changed..less rayon more polyester =not as cool fabric. I didn't know this until I received the 3 tops from the seller. The fit was tighter not as loose as previous fabric blend.  I kept them for September weather.
3.0,"These are OK, but the cooling sensation is extremely gimmicky.  There are rare circumstances where you will feel a cooling sensation when you put these on or when the wind hits you just right but it is not something that lasts for more than a few seconds.  If it's hot outside and you are playing sports and get sweaty...yes, you guessed it, these are simply going to make your arms feel hotter, just like if you were wearing long sleeves if not worse.  I use them to protect from the sun, and they serve that purpose for baseball and dog walks in Arizona, but don't expect any magic here."
3.0,"Very cute but the backs on the pair I received don't screw on. They are made to screw on, but they just slide off, meaning they don't grab the post at all."
3.0,"Love this ring, but the black is wearing off!"
3.0,I have long thick curly hair and a big problem for me is matted hair when I wake up. I bought these to help prevent matting so I wouldnt have to braid my hair every night. It didnt help at all.  Great for keeping hair out of the way during activities though.
3.0,Cute and dainty but they broke the second time I wore them.
3.0,A comfortable sweatshirt but pretty short and wide. When you lift your hands up there's a chance a peek of your tumny will show. I personally don't love that.
3.0,"The clasp that holds the strap to the watch has broken after a few months. This is an important part of the strap as it keeps it in place holding the watch to your wrist. It was worth the money at first. Only one strap lost a component. The other three are still in working order, however, I could have lost my apple watch, and that would have been devastating! Beware."
3.0,"She absolutely loves them! But the toe part on the outside of the shoe, the color fades very fast! She's has had them for a week and color is almost all gone :("
3.0,"After reading reviews, I decided to order a larger size than normal (ordered XL, usually wear a 10 or 12 in pants). I’ll keep them as they are comfortable and stretchy, but they are tight, so will be wearing long tops to help cover the areas I’d rather not advertise"
3.0,"You get what you pay for with this watch.  It looks nice with the blue-ish glass and the gold metal gears, but after a week of wearing it, the band broke.  I took it to a watch repair place to get that fixed and also to resize the band as it's too big for my wrist.  They replaced the pin that broke on the band, but they couldn't resize it for some reason.  They said it was too difficult.  (Not the watch's fault but kinda strange to hear that from a professional watch repair place.)  Other than that, it's okay."
3.0,"Had to throw one away, (came in a pack of three).......the buckle was defected.....the prong kept slipping thru the frame.....would not hold."
3.0,The fit is snug which is good to keep it on and you can fold up ear flap if you don't need it. The only thing is the sweat flap on the inside is too narrow and tends to come out.
3.0,Sleeve on right arm was torn.
3.0,Beautiful but the straps are not sterdy enough to carry the weight of the tote
3.0,"Item was a gift for a 10 year old size XL, tanks are too big and being returned. Aside from that the colors and actual make of the tanks are great!"
3.0,Very big and gawdy! I returned them immediately. I'm more of smaller earring kinda girl. If you like big jewelry this are for you. Was a very easy return though.
3.0,Way to big. Order a size down.
3.0,"The hanging design will fold a little bit. The necklace arrived with a irksome chain tangle woven in the hanging design, I almost sent it back but patience fixed it.  I gifted this to a loved one who saw it online and liked it.  It may have irritated her skin as she wore it,  it seemed that it did but she didn't want to say anything  8o("
3.0,"First let me preface that this does function. What it is not is a &#34;normal&#34; textured scarf. Fabric is the same as my London Fog raincoat (scarf side) and thicker plasticky type material for waterproof side. I intended this to be a travel substitute for umbrella, but the bulk is way more than that and would lack insulting properties of &#34; normal&#34; scarf. Everything I pack must have at least 2 uses, and this would not work as accessory scarf with blouse. It works as well as attached hood on London Fog raincoat. The pockets are novel idea, but very visible on rain side. Basically three layers--1&2 being the fabric tube and 3 is the waterproof layer. When turned opposite, the cloth tube is on outside.  Good in theory, not so good performance.  While I won't return, it MAY have use at home, but even after I washed it, the fabric would not &#34;soften up&#34; and have a drape to it when worn, so it still looks like cloth raincoat material around the neck and shoulders. Not attractive."
3.0,"Although the design and colors are appealing, my 8-year-old son had holes on the bottom of the ball of his feet after just 1 day of us. The fabric is thick enough to feel cushiony but the quality is poor so it easily ripped. The socks are just ok, if you need regular daily sock you'll be ok. But if you want long lasting reliable ones these aren't it."
3.0,It was a little long for me
3.0,larger than i thaught
3.0,"Way too small. Ordered XL and hoped they fit as other reviews said ran large. I usually wear a 16.  Had a cut for a small waist and narrow hip, like for a boy, not a woman. Quality was good if they had fit."
3.0,I liked the sweatshirt but the sizing is small
3.0,Is see through.
3.0,Sort of short on my legs but cute pattern
3.0,"While the leather the gloves are made of is soft and supple, and they are warm as advertised, they are not sensitive enough to allow for texting.  I can sometimes pull the phone menu down and changes pages while wearing these gloves, I cannot text with them.  As many times as I touch the screen, nothing happens on my phone.  I am disappointed as that was one of the main reasons for choosing these gloves."
3.0,This pair of earrings is very tiny. It is for a child.
3.0,"The description of these pants stated that they were 31 inches long.  However they hardly reached my ankles. I ordered the size 8, regular length."
3.0,"I love the look of these pants! The only problem I have with them is the button is extremely lose and gonna pop off, the sizing is a little off but I can wear a belt and make it work!"
3.0,"Looks better in picture, Challenge to adjust.  Supplier was very prompt with my concern and refunded."
3.0,"For some reason I thought in the picture that the shorts had a ribbon drawstring or other adornment on the front. It doesn't and looks somewhat odd as the fabric pattern isn't stitched to match down the front seam, where your eyes are most drawn to. The shorts are slightly small for a US medium. They're not horrible, but not as nice-looking as I was hoping for."
3.0,I washed it and it fits a little better. The zipper is  a little hard to make a connection some time's.
3.0,"It’s smaller than the size labeled and it’s the stretchy time of material not cotton. The letters look glued on like you can tell it’s made at home (iron on) type of decal. Cheat price, cheap shirt."
3.0,"I thought I ordered size Medium and received a Small, and there is no way the Small even comes close to fitting a child,  despite the claim “Two Sizes, Suitable For Most American Adults”.  I really need this for my Marine when he comes home on Christmas leave this week, so I will order another and hope for the best."
3.0,runs too small for me
3.0,"Original review Jun 22, 2022:<br />Yet my kid constantly plays with them - takes them off just to put them back on. Are they that cute? Or is it the kid? I'd buy them again.<br /><br />Update December 30, 2022:<br />Recently my kid was diagnosed with flat feet. While it is not dangerous yet, and many kids ""grow out of it"", it is most important to wear a correct type of shoes. This type of shoe is not good for healthy feet. Invest in proper footwear, solid/non cushion, supportive, etc. Do not buy alternatives... many parents are forced to cut corners since everything is so damn expensive. Some don't even think about the consequences, so I took time to update this review as a reminder. Avoid health issues now vs paying for doctors later."
3.0,Cute but a little big and the quality of the sewing isn't great.
3.0,The fit is comfortable but a little small in the chest area. Total side boob.
3.0,"Boggle is a fun game, and although this keychain is durable and portable, it's hard to play with.  The letters are hard to get to stay on one side, the timer is short, and it doesn't open to push over stubborn blocks.  I would still get the real game, and only get this for times where you're afraid the pieces might get lost."
3.0,This is not a review but rather a comment regarding the existing reviews.<br />Anyone notice that three are identical but supposedly written by three different individuals?
3.0,"These are nice enough, but do not go near as high as the picture shows. Im 5'2 and these hit at the knee or just below."
3.0,I had one before and  I thought the fabric was softer.  I use it but it's not like I remembered from before.
3.0,Definitely not soft or breathable!<br />The fabric is thick and very much synthetic feeling (and shiny).<br />The waistband has an inner tight band for the half part of the waist which is just so not comfortable.<br />I bought it to feel comfy at home and will definitely not wear them.<br />I asked to return it and waiting for an update hoping they approve the return.<br /><br />***update on return***<br />The seller was very nice and approved my request by a refund.
3.0,Too small;( it was 5 bucks to send it back n try the bigger size;(
3.0,Doesn't stay still but good enough
3.0,"The item is designed and fits well, but the fabric choice for the lining and ear flaps is quite poor. The fabric sheds excessively and I think it may eventually become threadbare."
3.0,"This item gives you the impression of being much larger.  It is very cute, and certainly primitive but with the design, and materials used this item is way over priced.  Make sure to close attention to size detail because the picture gives the illusion of being much larger.  IT IS NOT.  On a good note the item is definitely primitive, and did help in the design we trying to meet.  Being a crafter I could have made this item much, much cheaper."
3.0,got MANY compliments when i wore it but had to tug at it all day..it was cut a little short...the skirt doesn't come with it...its a cute top but don't think I would pay that MUCH to buy again
3.0,Good Panties..  But NOT sized correctly.  Since I can't return them...  I'm stuck with a dozen pairs ...
3.0,This works well. It holds plenty of cards. Placing large amounts of cash with it is ok but not great.
3.0,"I ordered these shoes to go with my daughters halloween costume. Week one and they still looked great. Then they slowly started to lose their sparkle (seriously, the sequence fell off). After about 2.5 weeks they look worn and dingy. The glitter around the entire top and front of the shoe is gone. I know they were priced cheap, but I feel they should have lasted a lot longer."
3.0,"The listing says the jacket is a men’s, but the zipper is on the left hand side. A little snug. Zippers above the breast pockets are aesthetic only, however there are functional breast pockets under the zippers."
3.0,"Was very pleased with the speed of delivery, quality of the dress and the price was great!"
3.0,The purse isn't anything fancy and I would have liked it better had it had at least one outside pocket but it suffices for work.
3.0,Gold looked a little fake (it was so bright).
3.0,"Dont really like how glasses look on me. Bigger than what I expected! The only reason why I rated it three stars...other than that the quality and feel of glasses is amazing! Glasses really sit on your face well and blocks out sun. Again, just didn't like the way they looked on me specifically."
3.0,"If you are looking for a high quality product, this is not what u want! Can use only for very casual dresses. Consider sizing because it is not adjustable. I'd order one size smaller than what your actual size is."
3.0,This is comfortable but very thin material. You will need to wear a slip underneath.
3.0,Fit a little bigger than expected. Great material. The red stripes made me feel like a circus tent.
3.0,"If you are not skinny, if you have any type of a bell this is not for you. I thought I would be able to wear under a low v neck. Definitely not for me"
3.0,Would be better if v neck. And the Niki sign is on front not on sleeve disappointed
3.0,Very nicely made great quality. But I just didn't like how it hung on me. Maybe better on someone else. I really liked the color and the fabric was a nice weight as well.
3.0,Very heavy case and my husband didn't care for it.  I use it for my real estate files and laptop.
3.0,"A little faded, not worth buying"
3.0,"This robe has shorter and wider arms than I expected - even thought it does say kimono style, the pic doesn't show that well.  Also, I ordered a larger size and it fit me fine, but if you wear more than a size10 dress or are very tall, this robe will probably not fit you well.  The fabric is good and comfortable, but as other reviewers noted, make sure you wash it alone a couple of times to get all of the dye out or it will stain your clothing in the wash."
3.0,Personally think it runs small. Bought a lg but the arm pits were tight and there was no bust room at all
3.0,"well, I have been trying to lose weight anyway . . . .Nice style but cut small."
3.0,Pretty skirt but not long enough I want it to swing on the floor but it doesn’t. I’m 5”8 160lbs soooo yeah.
3.0,"This doesn't seem practical for a women to carry credit cards and cash. The phone part is nice, but not sure all phones would fit in it. I do like that you can just use it as wrist let. The color is okay but not great. Overall I can't really recommend this bag."
3.0,"First of all, my wife ordered black, and she got yellow. The size is bigger than what she usually get. Also it is much longer than what is shown on the model. The one on the model is ""above the knees"". The one she got reaches the knees. It is not just because it is larger. The design is different. The fabric is 100% polyester. It may not be comfortable during a hot day. The other problem is that the yellow fabric is see-through. So be prepared to dress properly for under garments."
3.0,"It's okay, back,front,side pockets are small (cannot put smartphone Note 5 in pockets). Definitely a second or imperfect because stitching is poor,leather patch inside without name or reason for its placement, along with an outside tag without a name that is too weak to hold any keychain with keys. Pocket on back is only deep enough for a Altoids tin; inside zipper pocket is 5 inches wide, 5 inches deep."
3.0,"So just to be clear, this is NOT an infinity scarf.  The ends do not link.  It's a normal scarf.  That said, the material is soft and fluffy and I may even get a few more in other colors b/c so far it seems like a good value.  I was just a bit disappointed b/c I was hoping to receive an infinity scarf."
3.0,This is a pretty piece of custom jewelry. I had to Return the necklace because it was already broke when I took it out the package. Only gettin 3 stars.
3.0,Colors were not what was pictured but scarf appeared to be decent quality.
3.0,"weird material, like stretchy almost like a bathing suit material, fit not true to size, if u want it comfy, go one size up, other than that its ok, Ill make do with it, color on top brighter than on pic, but the lace is cute and i like the ombre effect, so its ok"
3.0,"I have 12"" biceps and forearms. The sleeves fit okay, not as snug as I'd like.<br />They are surprisingly delicate; the first ones I put on got runs in them, like in a woman's stockings.<br />You can't choose which designs you'll get. Of the eight I got, two in particular don't appeal to me. Those were the test sleeves, the ones that ripped.<br />Instead of one design that wraps around the whole sleeve, the design is printed twice on the top and bottom. That creates two strips where the designs meet, and it's difficult to hide the strips.<br />For the price, these aren't bad, but I probably won't buy these again. I'll spend more on more durable sleeves and to be able to choose the designs."
3.0,"This was just what my granddaughter wanted and she loved it, She wore it all the time, the only thing is it tore apart at the top, so it did not hold up for very long."
3.0,"This is really a beautiful box, and for presentation of a necklace ONLY it is perfect.  For my project, I was organizing jewelry from an estate, and most necklaces included either matching earrings and/or a brooch.  The box is too shallow to allow setting these things inside.  Thus, the lid won't close.  It IS marketed as a necklace box, so perhaps I shouldn't complain."
3.0,never really wore it. not very flattering or interesting
3.0,You can not beat this price for this item. My nieces are enjoying their charms & bracelets for Mother 's.
3.0,"They dont fit well you have to bend them to secure to your ear, and they are not that fliexible"
3.0,Very fun but because of the large size and the extremely long bar it is hard to wear for a long time. Would be great if you could remove and put on your own properly sized bar.
3.0,the dress is good quality and fits well on the body. But the boob area is way to large
3.0,This dress shows a bit too much cleavage for the office but it's an ok buy
3.0,"Was expecting better quality first time purchase on crocs, should of known that they are not known for quality but comfort. Cannot attest to that of yet because am undecided if I will keep them or return. The fit runs a little larger than your norm so will decide and update later on."
3.0,Not crazy about these.  They run small. I did use their sizing.  There is no stretch to them.  The lace and colors are nice.
3.0,"I love the watch face. Black cats are my favorite, although I love all cats. I have a beautiful black cat of my own. The only bad thing about this watch is the band. Maybe after I've had it for a while and break it in, it will be more comfortable. But until then it is stiff and scratchy and the band has started to crack a little."
3.0,I fits okay. a Little big for my very small frame.
3.0,Giving it a three star because it is extremely see through (the white one at least); you definitely need an under dress; used as part of a Halloween costume
3.0,Really loose and baggy fit. Picture seems a little deceptive.
3.0,I wish the graphics were printed. Looks like an iron on. shirt is cute and festive.
3.0,Fit small on big faces. Quality is good but not as expected. Good polarized daily use sunglasses. Thanks a lot.
3.0,It broke the first day the left ear stopped working it just stays up for how long it took to come I'm kinda sad.
3.0,"Tight fit over ass, and pockets kind small to fit hand in."
3.0,It runs very small...
3.0,the fit was a little tight and haven't had them that long and already have holes.
3.0,"Absolutely beautiful dress but NOT for anyone larger than a B cup. If I were more modestly chested, I would give this five stars because the dress is beautiful and made with light fabric."
3.0,The fabric was very thin.
3.0,Gemstones look like they are hot glued on and can easily fall off. Not bad for the price though.
3.0,"You get what you pay for, neck and bottom of shirt is frayed and incomplete, fabrics not terrible but not super comfy. It's an okay shirt, don't regret the purchase but would definitely go for something else if I'm looking for a nice sweater."
3.0,"Christmas 2020 I bought these for my husband, 6'3 & 240ish lbs. size XXL-T. I gave those 5 stars. He LOVED having lounge pants that are not highwater.  Fast forward to Christmas 2021 & he asked for another pair. These are the EXACT same size as last order only nothing like the previous ones. These were GIANT! He could have fit another person in them with him!  We compared the tags with those from previous year and every single thing was identical EXCEPT for the country in which they were made. These are going back. UGH!"
3.0,"Seem to be well made, no long term experience , I returned them cause the hard plastic wasn’t very flexible , leaking and I don’t have a small face."
3.0,This dress is way cuter on the model. It made me look pregnant and matronly. Wasn’t the look I was going for.
3.0,"I bought a set of these at a marathon expo and tried them for the race. I like to wear my bib over my abdomen and by the time I got 10k in, two of the magnets had popped off when my hands brushed the bib. I removed the other two pair and placed my number on my shorts by the leg, which worked fine."
3.0,Loved the shoes but they were TWO sizes too big for my granddaughter. We will save these for her to grow into. Meanwhile I ordered another pair two sizes down. Fit great!
3.0,Gave this as a gift for Christmas.  Package was shipped to recipient.  The lavender was a bit too strong so she couldn't have the booties out of the container for very long.  The product seemed to me overpriced for what was received.  I would not recommend this product to friends for purchase.
3.0,"The material and everything were nice and soft but this thing is HUGE!  I ordered a medium.  I am a size 27 inch waist, it was basically falling off of me and not tight at all."
3.0,"I got excited with this when I got it. It's actually really well made and looks flawless, but I had a problem with the adhesive, I was allergic to it and it gave me a little rash. Might work for you but not for me. Im so sad about it."
3.0,"REVIEW: Thermowave Xtreme Merino Wool Base Layer Mens - Thermo Shirts for Men Long Sleeve<br /><br />MANUFACTURER: Thermowave<br />COMPOSITION: Outside layer: 80% Merino wool, 20% polyamide / Inside layer: 100% polyester<br />WASH: Machine wash using wool cycle, wash with similar colors, wash inside out, use wool detergent, no bleach, no fabric softener, do not tumble dry, pull into shape when wet, iron on low only, dry cleanable (but no tetrachloroethylene)<br />SIZE: 2XL (as reviewed)<br />COLOR: Black / Dark Grey Melange<br />STYLE: Crew-neck, long-sleeved shirt, pocketless<br />WEIGHT: 200-220 GSM<br />GUARANTEE: Thermowave.com website says the 2-year warranty only applies if bought directly from Thermowave, so none (?)<br />MADE IN: Lithuania<br /><br />Wool is good. I like wool. All these synthetics today are great, but nothing beats good wool from a good manufacturer for dry, wicking, warm clothing that tends to last.<br /><br />I don’t know anything about Thermowave as a company, but I do know it’s not making products in China but in Lithuania, which is a refreshing change. I can’t think of anything I own from a Lithuanian company, so kudos to Thermowave.<br /><br />Looking for a nice base layer product that is not too hot but also not too cool, I got this midweight base layer shirt through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION<br />I find very little difference in feel between the wool/polyamide blend on the outer layer of the shirt and the polyester on the inside. The inner layer against your skin is a tiny bit softer than the outer layer.<br /><br />The shirt is nicely cable stitched in a contrasting gray stitching that marks most of the construction points of the shirt. I say “most” because the bottom hem stitching is not as rugged as everywhere else. Don’t know why it differs, but it does. No stray threads or danglers, so good job stitching and trimming.<br /><br />The sleeves have a rolled cuff, and one cuff has THERMOWAVE on it—which given that there is no front/back tag may be the only way to discern if it’s on the correct way. But I wore the unique cuff on both sides, and I can’t say that the shirt has a designated front or back. They appear to be the same.<br /><br />As for the weight of the fabric, it feels on the light side of midweight.<br /><br />No gripes about the construction, but do note that it is a mistake to think of the whole shirt as 80% wool when only the outer layer is 80% wool and 20% polyamide while the inner layer is 100% polyester. That inner layer brings down the actual total wool percentage.<br /><br />STYLE<br />Typical crew-neck long-sleeve T, with no front pocket. I chose the navy color, and it’s nice to look at and is a true navy, almost closer to black than blue. (The natural lighting in the attached images does not do the color justice. It's both much darker and bluer than the images appear.)<br /><br />SIZING<br />The fit in the 2XL is snug, like a base layer should be. The sleeve length is fine, and I normally take a Tall, but this works. Will it shrink over time? Not so far, but we will see.<br /><br />CARE<br />The list of care considerations (see above) when washing is lengthy—and onerous. If you have only a few items like this, you may be waiting around for other similar items to accumulate before doing a load. Otherwise, you are probably looking to wash this by hand just to keep it cycling through your available options.<br /><br />So, the overview…<br /><br />PRO<br />+ Well-made, with careful, strong stitching<br />+ Breathes well<br />+ Fits well<br />+ Feels soft out of the bag and retains the softness after washing<br />+ Features an attractive styling and understated, contrasting colors<br />+ Made in Lithuania—nice to have European-made clothes<br /><br />MEH<br />* Lacks a discernible front or back, so is it on the correct way? Does it matter?<br />* Features a confusing primary image on Amazon that makes it look like it’s the top AND bottom, but it’s only the top included<br />* Feels more lightweight than midweight<br />* To wash and dry takes more care than most clothes<br />* Packed in a lot of packing that you ultimately discard (see photos)<br /><br />CON<br />- Sports a $79.90 MSRP at the time of this review, which is $20 too high for what you get<br />- Appears to offer no guarantee if bought through Amazon rather than its own site<br />- Have worn it on chilly days and have felt…well, chilly<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />I have mixed feelings about this Thermowave base layer because—to me at least—it has proven disappointing at keeping me warm on the cool days on which I’ve worn it. Put this in the category of “You had one job…”<br /><br />Is it too lightweight? Maybe. YMMV on assessing what constitutes a midweight base layer, but this is definitely a lighter material than the Under Armour and Reebok base layers I own—which are warmer and yet contain no wool.<br /><br />Factor in the $80 price, and it’s hard not to feel disappointed. If it were $60 instead, maybe. I want to support clothing makers in the USA and Europe, but value still matters. If the base layer proved more adept at dry, comfortable warmth, sure. But I feel like it didn’t achieve that as well as it should for the cost.<br /><br />Two stars? Three? I’ll offer three because I want to encourage continued growth of companies making clothes that are NOT in China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and the other low-cost usual suspects. At the same time, I’d recommend looking for a different base layer that provides a better value and performance while still being made in the USA or Europe."
3.0,It fit but it wasn't slim fit. I wanted a tight feeling.
3.0,It fit but I'm a shorter woman (5'2&#34;) and the dress didn't quite look like I wanted it to. It looks better on a little taller woman than myself.
3.0,These were a good value but didn’t fit. The sizing was not easy to determine.
3.0,"I received this for free as a sample to review and it is very hard for me to review because I have mixed feelings.<br /><br />It claims to be RFID blocking but I have no way of verifying, nor do I think RFID blocking is worth worrying about for 95% of the population.<br /><br />It's faux elegant. I mean, from a distance, it looks great. Close up, and holding it, not so much. Even though it's made to look like an expensive handbag, it doesn't feel like an expensive handbag. Don't get me wrong, it feels pretty good and looks pretty good if you're going to the prom. It looks dressy, but it's not expensive or &#34;close-up&#34; impressive. You know what I mean?<br /><br />If your 16 year old wants something for the prom, this is perfect.<br /><br />Note: Sample provided for review."
3.0,Hard to find reader sunglasses.  Just wish they made frames  larger and the lenses lighter color
3.0,Shrank after washing.
3.0,Very Cute.<br />But don't last long.<br />Lasted about a month. After the material unwound from the wire.
3.0,"I had the same problem that another reviewer had.  I used one of these tags on luggage that shipped from San Francisco to Athens, and back again.  It returned with the clear plastic cover over the name and address information half out of its holder; and the paper address under the plastic cover was torn.  A design problem that the manufacturer of this otherwise excellent tag can probably fix.  D. Black"
3.0,It kind of see thru material.
3.0,Bought for airport outfits to match my sneakers. Material is VERY thin and is more like leggings than sweatshirt. Pants are see-through. Top is short.
3.0,"The dress is cute and fits as expected. My daughter seems happy with it for her luau themed father/daughter dance.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the color of the dress does not match the picture shown. The picture shows the dress as having pink it in but the dress I received is purple, not pink. The colors are also much darker than what the picture shows."
3.0,These are nice but don't come with earring backs as pictured.
3.0,Its a pretty top. I made a gift of it to a friend. Fits very well too!
3.0,This dress is shorter than I thought it would be especially from what the picture showed. I have washed it several times but I never dry my dresses and it has faded quite a bit. Its super cute but I have to wear leggings with it.
3.0,"Cute, but made of cheap materials."
3.0,hat quailty was good but the hat was too shallow to stay on. There was no interior headband or anything to adjust so I had to return it.
3.0,Vintage Half Frame Semi-Rimless Wayfer Style Classic Optical RX Sunglasses is good item
3.0,"Warning... this is not a pair of earrings . It is one you can clip on your ear or pierced. I thought it a mistake so ordered another &#34;pair,&#34; same thing. I kept it anyway , they just each go to the left of my ear . I like them , they look nice and match my angel wings necklace .... just a warning folks ..."
3.0,"Full skirt. So fun! Too tight in bust, fabric does not stretch."
3.0,shame
3.0,"It really wasn’t like the pic , collar was very flat and no spunk about it...first time I wasn’t pleased with what I bought"
3.0,"Broke the first day I wore it. Was able to put together again,but, am leary of wearing it. Thinner and more &#34;tinny&#34; looking than I anticipated."
3.0,"Nice pants, fit a size smaller than listed. Very thin cotton material."
3.0,Case did not snap securely all the around. One corner.
3.0,"Returning the product, the dress fits nicely but the length is below my knees and looks matronly.  I also chose the wrong color.  The pink is too “bubble-gummy”."
3.0,It didn't looked as advertised. My brother in law wasn't happy with his gift and I was embarrassed!
3.0,Didn't wear much and buckle strap broke.  Nice shoes but the strap should be better quality.
3.0,The shoes seemed like they would work well at first but after wearing them a few times a week for about 3 weeks the soles are already wearing thru
3.0,I usually need to order 2X my actual size but this time it's way to big.  😕  I will give it to my best friend.
3.0,"They are warm, however, my toddler can get them off easily. The velcro is uselessly placed, so I glued a longer strip of velcro on so that they actually were tighter. But the mittens are very short, and there is a gap between the coat and the mittens. I do not recommend these."
3.0,"Reviews are correct in terms of length. If you are over 5'5"", they will be ankle length and not floor length unless you lower the hem and then they are long enough for flip flops or low flats."
3.0,"super cute jacket! nice material and super warm, the only reason im giving it 3 stars is because it runs very big for womens sizes and now i have to wait extra long to return/ get a new one and i need it pretty soon!"
3.0,"Would not buy again. Definitely not as fitted as expected, I mean cmon that picture looks very photoshopped.<br />The material is strange. It’s like a weird 70s leisurewear polyester. I got this for my husband and when he tried it on, all he needed was white flowy pants and a wooden bead necklace and he would’ve looked like a cult leader"
3.0,"Slippers are nice and my 2yo likes to wear them ( I bought another cheaper pair of slippers, which he refuses to wear). Sizing is off... he is a 7 and I bought an 8 expecting them to fit him next year and I dont think they will.<br />Quality is ok, they are soft. I hope they wash well in the washing machine."
3.0,Thought we were getting three different pairs of one direction socks and got three of the same.
3.0,"Loved the way they look, but they're not very sturdy, all of them have fallen apart."
3.0,I looked like the ghost of Christmas present in this.  If you’d like to look like that by all means go for it otherwise it looks like a bathrobe.
3.0,"True to size, so too big. Material is a little heavy and really didn't fit like the picture. I did have too get the waist line altered to fit more snug"
3.0,"I had a lightweight Russell sweatshirt for several years and decided I needed a new one. It is super soft, is very large for me but that's how I wanted it to fit, I thought it was perfect for me. The first time I wore it I realized that both pockets were coming apart at the top. I hadn't even put my hands in the pockets when I noticed they were undone but I was on vacation and had to choice but to wear it. I still will buy Russell sweatshirts but I will check the pocket seams before I intend to wear it."
3.0,"The goggles themselves are great. They function as goggles should, keeping the water out of my eyes. As for reviews claiming they don't fit, a simple adjustment of the tightness or placement of the strap on the head is all that's needed.<br /><br />The three stars is because of the incessant plea for reviews from the seller via email. I just want a pair of goggles and did not want to sign up for email spam. One email is request is fine, but stop there. The option to unsubscribe doesn't excuse the spam. Again, I wanted goggles, not the inconvenience of having to unsubscribe from emails."
3.0,Tarnish after second wear
3.0,"Updated review- At first I really liked this watch. It is not very expensive, but looks great. The bezel is very high, thick case. But it's a cool watch that you can wear with jeans or suit.- problem is that it only lasted about 2 years. I have several watches that are decades old and working fine. It technically works but does not keep good time."
3.0,"Even when the seams look like they're about to pop open, the bag stayed together. Used and abused this bag for 3 years. It's able to hold a lot more than it looks."
3.0,Ordered an XL but it fits more like a Medium. It still might work but we may have to return it. I would say order 2 sizes up from your normal size.
3.0,Love the feel of his material!!
3.0,Very comfortable and pretty dress.  I’m 5’ 150# and I ordered the medium. Fit like a glove.  The fabric was thick enough that you don’t see through  it and it stretches a little. Great quality.  I also boight the tan and black and it’s a different fabric. I didn’t like that one as much.  It’s very faltering.
3.0,Hat is decent. Not the color I hoped it would be.
3.0,"These sunglasses are nice. I got them for my boyfriend. He really likes the polarization, and the look of them, but he says that they're heavier on his face than other sunglasses he's had. Otherwise, real nice sunglasses!"
3.0,Bought this for night driving but did not seem to do anything for that but it was great for cloudy day and rainy day...use it while flying my model airplanes and it does make it clearer and brighter...but again did NOTHING  for my night vision problems...
3.0,"I am usually small or medium in tops, my bra size is a 34C and I found medium to be too tight. But I definitely do not think the lace is as horrible as other reviews mentioned. I actually really like the quality of the shirt but just wish I sized up to a large."
3.0,Looks nothing like the pic.
3.0,I  ordered  a size 4-5T for my 4 year old granddaughter. My granddaughter loved the dress but couldn’t wear it because it was way too big for her in length and width. It was even big and too long for her 7 year old sister. I was disappointed that the size given is not true to size expected.
3.0,"Not comfortable to wear, the upper part edge is sharp"
3.0,Nice but it broke
3.0,"Really nice quality but very tight and small.  Go one size up and you will be happy.  Gave the Medium to my daughter in law who is a size 4, didn't fit me, a size 10."
3.0,These are not one size fits all. they slide down on my plus size hips.
3.0,These don't seem to stay up very well.
3.0,Good for the 10 times worn and 2-3 washes.
3.0,"Based on the given dimensions, i thought it would fit my needs, but the bag’s shape is tapered in such a way that it doesn’t even begin to fit my phone (iphone 8+). Very disappointing because it’s pretty and seems well made enough. I wish i could find a delicate looking bag with a shoulder strap so i can be hands-free at a cocktail party and have my phone, a pair of reading glasses and a lipstick with me. Not so much to ask of a bag, right? Seems impossible to find, they’re all “clutches” or office-type bags. This bag would have been perfect if it were just a few inches larger in each dimension. Btw, i bought the “Gray Ore” but it’s not gray, it’s definitely more like a dark bronze color."
3.0,"This is a nice travel bag, small, discreet, and easily concealed. Even with lots in it, out l iies fairly flat against your body. I can't say that it is successful with RFID blocking. As no price is given, I can't say it's worth the cost."
3.0,Very large. Orange color is very bright. Cute decal
3.0,"I purchased this shirt in an XL in the yellow color.  I found it to be a little tight in the chest and shoulder area.  I normally wear a medium/large in shirts, yet the XL turned out to be a smidge tight.  The color and pattern is pretty, however, the material is stiff, slightly resembling a paper bag kind of material.  The shirt was cheap and it's not worth me returning.  It's not something I reach for all the time in my closet but I'll wear it in a pinch."
3.0,Decent product. Not all three are exact same size. The elastic band is pretty snug but I have a large noggin. Product works and probably a perfect fit for 95% of people.
3.0,"Zippers broke very easy, dissapointed"
3.0,this dress fits very snug if you don't like your bra lines or pantie lies showing don't order it
3.0,Was fun for 2 weeks. Way too small on my face and it felt really flimsy
3.0,"I was unhappy with this purchase because the  color that I ordered was not the color that they sent.  However my daughter, who I bought the dress for, was happy with the color and the dress overall"
3.0,"It's a cute top, but nothing special."
3.0,"The bracelet is as shown, but it pinches the skin, I have to wear a watch above it to keep it from pinching"
3.0,One boot fit perfect the other just to get your foot in it I had to stretch it out. They are average for comfort
3.0,Kinda chincy but wearable
3.0,"I was so excited to get this dress in the mail and wear it to a friends wedding in November. Unfortunately, it just did not look as expected. The lace at the top is beautiful, but was too close together looking more black since you couldn't see my skin as much underneath. I am 5'10 and because of this the stitch lines did not match up where they were supposed to. It looked like my dress wasn't pulled all the way down even though it was. I could have sized up, but I was afraid that it would be baggy in the areas that I didn't need the extra fabric. I will say the back and fish tail bottom was BEAUTIFUL and I almost kept the dress because of how much I liked that part, but it just was not worth it. I did end up returning it and trying something else. Beautiful dress just not on me."
3.0,"Cute dress, sleeves and top part of dress fit perfect but the waist and skirt area were huge, make<br />Sure u size down at least one size!"
3.0,You get what you pay for. My daughter just discovered zodiac signs and liked it.
3.0,"Cute, but the headband part was huge. I bought it for my daughter but even trying it on myself there was a good couple of inches above my head still open if I centered the car muffs on my ears."
3.0,Love the fit of this top but be cautious if washing with lighter clothes it will dye them and stain even after the first wash. That is the only flaw with this top. Wish I would have known and I would have saved so many other tops being stained.
3.0,Blue leather is darker than what’s in picture so can’t even see our names on either side so was disappointed. Good made leather key chain but I definitely wouldn’t go with black letters cause don’t look like pictures it shows you.
3.0,These are good. Very soft and comfortable and they wash completely clean. I wear a size 8 in underwear and I bought these in an XL so I would suggest getting these one size smaller than your normal size.
3.0,Unfortunately you can't see the picture on the shirt.  Maybe because I got it in dark grey?  If you buy this consider getting a different color.
3.0,"They look purple in the pic, but in reality they are just silver looking... wasn’t exactly what I expected! I specifically ordered them cause of the purple color!"
3.0,Some bleeding on the fabric . A little heavier than I expected for this flowy silhouette . Had to make tom of alterations to fit . Basic casual dress
3.0,Good pair of slides. They run really small. Suggest ordering a size or two up for them to fit comfortably.
3.0,I like the product. However I ordered capris and received pants. I kept them because I liked the fit and didn't want the hassle of returning.  I didn't try to reorder the Capri and get pants again so I ordered a different product.
3.0,I got these as a gift for my boyfriend and I and the first day that we wore them the leather came out of the metal piece. We both had to super glue the ends back in to hold it together. They are cute but I don't want to have to fix it repeatedly.
3.0,"My coworker has this dress and it is AMAZING on her so I ordered it. It is horrible on me!  If you have a waist and some booty, it looks great. I’m busty but i don’t have much of a waist or booty and it looked like I was 6 mo pregnant. Perfect for the hourglass shape, not so much for the apple shapes<br /><br />I’m 5ft6in, 150 lb, 34DD, and 6/8 pants and I ordered a medium."
3.0,Very pretty but the metal part turned my wrist black. Cheaply made.
3.0,"I ordered to use as a wide headband which is a shown use for these things.  Well, like most of this imported stuff from Asia, sizing seems to be to tiny asian framed bodies.  With a large female head, this really could have used some extra stretch or material.  Just beward of that issue with asian products."
3.0,Beautiful print - however the material is very...meh. And a bit loud when walking.
3.0,Awesome quality but it's a small fit. So if you have large wrists I'd pass on this one.
3.0,"Was not as pleased with item. The dress did have a small hole , and the quality was not as expected."
3.0,"Says surgical steel, but it turned green after a month."
3.0,"Too long for me, but I used."
3.0,Algo grande y no se puede recortar..pierde tono de colores
3.0,"Material is very thin and see thru the size is correct , very cute top but not appropriate to wear out"
3.0,"I like the cuffs but I can honestly only see myself wearing 2 of them. They're easy to put on and they stay in place.  I did love the little bonus hair clip that says BOSS all in cubic zirconia, though!"
3.0,Good quality wallet but shipping took longer than expected.
3.0,"Looks cheap, but then it WAS CHEAP so how can I complain?  Also, it is heavy and I think it would look best on larger-sized wrists and arms as dial is quite large.  It's adjustable (take links out), but I don't like it like I thought I would.  Will probably give it to someone else or wear it myself with bulky, winter clothing (over sweater sleeves)."
3.0,I like it. You have to bit down hard and it's got a heavy draw. Outside of that. It keeps me hydrated for half the day.
3.0,"You get what you pay for. Don't expect it to look extremely expensive, but it doesn't look cheap either, unless you're close up.<br />Fits nice, and hasn't broken. I wear it clubbing and to parties and it holds up fine. Longer than I thought tho!"
3.0,It was pretty but way too short!
3.0,This ring peeled away from itself very quickly. It has an overlaid layer that is poorly attached to the base. It leaves a very sharp edge when the top layer fails. It also leaves that weird green thing copper leaves on the skin. There is bettter quality jewelry for the same price elsewhere online.
3.0,Bonita la blusa<br />Pero la Tela no muy buena calidad
3.0,"Nice fit. Looks nice. Very soft fleece on outside, however the inside is rough and scratchy. Not the cozy feel I expected by the appearance of the garment."
3.0,Love it. Great alone or under clothes.
3.0,"This skirt looks fine, but it’s pretty low quality (makes sense given the price). A hook and eye closure would go a long way. If I planned to wear it often, I’d probably add it myself.<br /><br />I typically wear a 10/12 in pants and I got an XL skirt (normally I would order a L) and it fit fine at my natural waist— probably could have been slightly more snug but not a full size down. I have short legs (28 in inseam) and it fell at my knees, but I also have a long waist which I think helped based on how high it sat.<br /><br />The sequins snagged on a friend wearing lace, but that’s kind of the nature of the beast, so I don’t blame this skirt specifically. I do like that there was a slight stretch to the fabric as well."
3.0,this shirt fit small and the color leaks in the wash or if you sweat :/
3.0,"I ordered Medium and Large sizes to decide what would be better to me. “Large” size came to me like a real Small (I found a tag inside, look at the pictures). It was smaller than Medium when I measured both sweaters (look at the pictures ). The Medium fits me very well. But, Unfortunately, it has small defects exactly on the front of around neck (look at the pictures). I decided to return both. I must tell you that it doesn't have tags, no information about fabric. It doesn't feel like it has 5-10% cashmere (like it was described on the page). But it is soft, flattering, stretch. For this quality overpriced."
3.0,One of the fringe is coming part and she has only worn them for a week.  So as it comes out of the piston it’s in it then is too long and we may need to cut it off which she isn’t happy.
3.0,"I fell I  love with this watch, everything about it is amazing, elegant, stylish and perfect.<br />After couple of months it started to color my wrist brownish, as for me it's not a big deal, but price should be lower with this issue as u have to change leather every once and a while"
3.0,"This is an ok product, size is fine, holds things you need, but my complaint is about the smell. We purchased 2 - one for my husband and one for me.  They smell AWFUL! I have no problems with the smell of leather, but this is not a leather smell. It is very chemical and rubs off on anything it is in, touching, or around.  We bagged them both up, put sachets in with them and they still stink.  Nothing seems to get that horrible chemical smell to go away."
3.0,"I wanted a Angel Wings Necklace that was the perfect size and was somewhat unhappy when I received this necklace in the mail. However the picture on the sellers page makes it look like a very pretty necklace , up close it was not what I expected it to look like."
3.0,These are very cute tiny tags but they are way smaller than I expected them to be.  These are more for jewelry and not the crochet hats I needed them for.  The little holes are more sized for thread and not yarn.  I really wish they were a little bit bigger because they are adorable but unfortunately I can’t use them.
3.0,Comfy material but the right side is too big under the armpit area. I also noticed that hen I tried to fold it evenly it was off not symmetrical. Not worth the value.
3.0,"I am short (5'1) so this hits at a slightly awkward length for me... it's too short to be a dress but looks a bit long even with leggings. The waist band is also not very stretchy, so measure accurately. The fabric is also quite thin. I'm hoping the length will shrink up after a few washes."
3.0,I'm giving it 3 stars for being good quality but only 3 for not fitting my size 9
3.0,"They're super cute, but the smell is obnoxious."
3.0,Good to use for scouting. Dryers fast. They don’t fit true to size
3.0,"Ring is very pretty.  Problem is you cannot stretch or tighten it at all the ""metal"" used is just<br />too stiff.  Afraid if use too much pressure will break the ring.  Ring is too big for small<br />fingers and too small other fingers."
3.0,Solid polarized glasses for the money.  Good coverage and shape for heart shaped face with a large head.  Not very breathable but no sweat drip fogging issues either.  Again for the discount price it is fabulous.
3.0,"Not Meant for crocs, even though advertised as such. The back piece to these charms are too big and you will feel them on your foot. These are cute for other stuff but definitely not crocs, So if that’s what you are looking for just get the brand name not a Chinese third-party"
3.0,Not a big lady 3xl. Sorry to say. RUns wayyyy small!
3.0,The small circular clasp that attaches the saying tag to the key ring is extremely weak. He lost the tag the very first time he went somewhere and hasn’t been able to find it. It meant so much to him he was actually crying he lost it so I ordered a new one to replace it and will put a different link on it so it won’t come off. Upon receiving the new tag I barely turned the tag and the clasp opened up so now I could see why it fell off so quick.
3.0,"While this product is probably the best in it's price range, buyer beware you get what you pay for. I've tried a couple cheaper stainless steel money clips from Amazon and this one has the best tightness and proportion for actually holding bills and credit cards. However, the steel is cheap and inflexible, and with repeated use will break."
3.0,"These are not real true leather. They should be advertised as faux leather or something else instead of &#34;leather.&#34; They are adorable yes. The sizing is a bit off so make sure to measure your baby's feet before ordering. I would personally not order them for babies that are crawling as they will scuff and scratch immediately.<br />Pros:<br />*They are affordable<br />*They are cute<br />*They are cushioned bottoms and give more support than other &#34;real&#34; leather ones we have owned.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*They are not real leather (just preference I guess, but at least should be advertised correctly<br />*They scratch and scuff on the first crawl where other pairs we have owned (real leather) can withstand the crawling for months on end, even on cement.<br /><br />Overall they are a great price and would possibly purchase again if my baby was walking- but right now she refuses to walk and has already ruined this pair in 1 day by the scratching and scuffing from crawling around.  I did receive these at a discount for my unbiased and honest review."
3.0,"Love the dress, but it runs small"
3.0,"This dress was not flattering whatsoever. Returned it immediately. Hugged my body in the weirdest places. I can’t even decide if it was too large or too small because some areas it was loose, then it’d be tight around my gut. Definitely wasn’t the dress for me."
3.0,They were an OK purchase for the price.
3.0,"This runs small, I even ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it was tight ( big boob alert - go 2 sizes larger then your normal)"
3.0,Cheap looking but cute for the beach or pool
3.0,"Definitely NOT the material I expected. Sorta cheap and thin. Colors aren't as vibrant. More dull. Not a terrible dress, but I would not recommend buying it. The sleeves are a bit long, which would be fine if fitted, but they aren't fitted at all. It's not nearly as flattering on a thin girl as the image shows.<br /><br />Update: I paired it with a sleeveless jean jacket with lacy detail. In wearing it, I actually received a lot of compliments. Several people liked it. Even though I wasn't super pleased with it, I am happy that it wasn't a hideous loss of my money. I bumped it up to 3 stars that is to how others responded to it."
3.0,"The necklace is beautiful and good quality, but the ashes will not go in.  It comes with a small funnel to use, but the ashes won't go though it, either. Animal ashes are basically tiny bone fragments, and the opening is too small for them to go through, without crushing them up.  Losing my baby was hard enough, I can't crush up his ashes to get them into this necklace."
3.0,The pouch is to small I feel I'm average in my genital size
3.0,The plastic wrap this comes in was very time consuming trying to take off without breaking the chain or damaging it with cuts from scissors.<br /><br />The chain feels plastic but I’m trusting it’s the material the seller is telling all of us.  For you big neck folks go 22 or higher that 20 will have you looking like you are wearing a collar
3.0,"Just OK. The print is lovely. The length goes to my knees, which I wanted. Other than that I just feel ""eeh"" about the skirt. The material is shiny. The waistband is scrunchy-like & weird. I will say I got tons of compliments when I wore it, but I say that was because of the print (which is clear and well done), and not the material."
3.0,Fits but don't fit like the  top too loose and back part loose bottom half fit fine but top part no.UPDATE with a little alteration it fits and looks Great I have to have the lower back tightened but in love.I give it 4 stars now
3.0,"PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THEM IN BLACK !!!!!!!!!!!! So far, I like them. It hasn't been hot enough to see how well they work but I can at least say for now they are better then nothing and sweating up the brim of your hat-so gross feeling a cold wet hat brim, ughh. I will update when I can really put them to a test. But immediately I realized that there was a problem with the bright white color. Most of my hats are medium to dark colored and I have a lot of black hats. I tried placing the strip as far away from the edge as I could but if I lift my head/chin up you can see I have something there. You can see it more towards the ends-if you wear a more loose fit hat like me you can see more of the strips ends where the hat has space between side of forehead and inner brim of hat. This would be no problem at all if you had the option to BUY BLACK STRIPS. The best would be to make them in white, grey and black-but at LEAST black. Please consider.....Thxs."
3.0,Fabric could have been a bit thicker.
3.0,I like the color of the bra and the sizing of the bra.the only thing I’m concerned  it’s is I think it’s not going to hold up for long. I have worn it a couple times to the gym. I haven’t run in it yet. That will be the real test. I’ll update at that point
3.0,It’s ok. I felt it had potential so I kept it and will do modifications.<br />If ur short and fluffy it looks longer on you. And the point at which the light blue arrives in front looks tacky. This is also something I’m altering. Fabric is meh. But then again for the price I guess you get what u pay for.<br /><br />Not really suitable for girls who have a stomach pudge as the rolls show through the delicate fabric
3.0,They fit wouldn't suggest putting one as a septum piercing though because it may go past ur soft spot and it's kinda hard to get out and you'll look stupid trying to get it out. But for lip and ear rings I say they work pretty well
3.0,too tight .  Always get a medium but this was more of a small. Returned it
3.0,Nice looking glasses but cheaply made and not that effective for preventing glare while driving.
3.0,Price is low and so is the material quality on top of long ship time.  Was hoping for a little better.
3.0,The zipper is left handed. The tag says do not wash don't bleach don't iron don't dry clean don't tumble dry. Wipe with damp cloth. It would have been easier to say don't get dirty!
3.0,Love the style but the fit was very narrow. I usually wear a 9M in Vaneli but ordered a 9 1/2 M and it fit like a narrow.  Will return.<br />Tried again in 9 W & the W fit as tightly as the M.  I give up.
3.0,Larger frame than it appears on web pic but nice
3.0,The heel lip on one of the shoes folded in
3.0,"Cute little purse, like the beaded strap design and the textured straw weave at the top, but the bag they sent has one side of purse being the color/style I ordered that is the blue design and when you flip the purse over, it is the design with butterflies that is more purple in color....ironic thing is I almost ordered the purple design but opted for the more blue design, and the purse arrives and looks like I ended up with both, kinda like a reversible purse with two styles in one, just flip it over for a different color/pattern, so I think I'll go ahead and keep it. The product description says it is a cotton blend fabric but it looks/feels nothing like cotton anything,  not even a blend of sorts, instead it seems to be more like a thin, polyester-like man-made material one might find with a scarf, but it is still a cute little purse design overall. They should list specifically what fabric it truly is. I thought the beads for the strap would be like plastic pony-beads but they are wood, which seems better, was happy about that."
3.0,The only reason I didn't like about it is that the gold platting came off with in about 2 days of wearing it. Other then that the quality is very nice
3.0,Just received it. Will take on first trip in a few weeks.
3.0,"These are good quality and I would recommend them, but they seem to be sized completely wrong. My daughter is average to big and the 3-4 month size won't even come close to fitting around her ankle. There is too much fabric. More snaps or Velcro would be needed. There is no way they will stay on. By the time her ankles and legs would be fat enough the foot part will be much too small."
3.0,Looks great but needed to exchange bc it runs small. Button accents also look they'll need reinforcing.
3.0,"These shoes/boots came as expected, as advertised. The purple is dark and the soles are rubbery and grippy!<br /><br />I sent my pair back for a refund, and the reason is because they were just too big. The laceless system makes it hard to get these tight. The sizing is in CM, and I wear size 10 in Mens (28cm according to their chart). However, I could have easily ordered a 27.5, or maybe even a 27, and they would have got much better.<br /><br />Overall, I love the concept of these boots, and their minimalist nature. Ultimately, I decided to get something else, because it's hard to wear purple on a daily basis, haha. And they just didn't fit quite right."
3.0,The tiny button in the back was almost impossible to button!! Our 2 year old had 3 adults hovering over her to work the tiny button and loop!
3.0,This belt is for someone whose waist is much smaller than mine.  Doesn't stretch as much as I would like it to.
3.0,"I like the look of the cardigan, but the material is more like a thin t-shirt than a sweater. I know it said lightweight, but it is very thin. It also fits smaller than I thought it would. The one thing I liked is that it had pockets, but not a square sewn onto the outside visible. The pockets were hidden in the flow of the material, and more like a coat pocket. It you are using this more as a cover this is perfect, but it is not very warm."
3.0,The size I normally am was too small but they are soooo cute and I will order another.
3.0,"Simple, cheap everyday top - quality is ok, already pulling after on eeash"
3.0,"Looks exactly like the website. As other reviewers stated, this swimsuit isn't for the bigger chested ladies. I'm a 36 D and the large didn't fit. I'm pretty sure if i went up a size it still wouldn't fit. Bottoms fit fine though as i typically wear size 10/12 in clothing. Disappointed that i will have to return this item."
3.0,Loved the color and fit up top - there's a seam you cannot see that goes through the hips which caught on me and my hips are large so can't blame the dress.  Really liked it but sort of felt like I was mother of the bride in it rather than wedding guest.
3.0,They were a bit small and I even ordered up a size. I ended up giving both pair to son in college.
3.0,Not true to size and material very cheap
3.0,Pretty but a tad small
3.0,"The wallet is nicely constructed, made of leather on the outside and what appears to be a man made material lining the inside portions. I like the minimal aspect of the wallet, it is simple and elegant. It is not quite as pink as I had hoped, being a more brownish pink. Still pleasing but unexpected. My biggest issue with the wallet is the lack of actual compartments. It instead relies heavily on clear plastic holders for various cards. It will take some getting used to. I am not fond of that part of its design."
3.0,"Ordered for my niece for a Halloween costume, this is standard costume quality. The material is thin and shiny, the color is more of a royal blue than the navy that is shown in most of the photos. I don't expect it to last longer than the couple of wears that she will need for Halloween festivities. She's 5'5&#34;, 120lbs, and slender, she liked the fit of this costume."
3.0,"I like the idea but the fit isn’t great — too lose in the neck, and the hem line is curling in on itself after only a few washes"
3.0,"fits great at first, then stretches out as the day goes on."
3.0,"Super cute hooded jacket, very soft with a nice weight to it- looks just as pictured in the listing.  Unfortunately the zipper set up isn’t the best quality- the zipper mechanism breaks off the zipper track fairly easily. We were able to exchange our first jacket for a replacement quickly and easily but the same thing happened with our replacement. Such a shame as it really is cute and my son loves it."
3.0,The pants are lightweight--as described. They zip off into shorts--as promised. But they are about 4 inches longer than I needed. I put elastic in the hems.
3.0,It ran bigger than expected
3.0,I haven't tried this on yet- the material is pretty flimsy and its light polyester/spandexy.. Doesn't look too tight though which is good!! It's pretty cute just not the best quality!
3.0,"(XL) I ordered the black with the vibrant floral colors. It's a very pretty dress and I love that it's razor back.  It is made of a nice weighted material that makes clothes hang well.  However, I'm 5'10 and hippy.  Usually this type of dress is flattering on my shape but that didn't workout this time.  I must say that I'm not a big fan of pockets because if you have hips, it makes it even more bulky.  But that seems to be the style on all the dresses now, so it can't seem to be avoided. Also, although its a maxi, it reached right above my ankle and I prefer it to be longer.  And the chest area also was a tad tight...(38DDD), and that caused the empire seem to ride high and not fit below the breast like it should.  I'm saddened to return it because its actually pretty. If I'd have gone up a size, then it would have been shapeless so I do encourage to go with your actual size and just see if that fits.  I would recommend the dress even though I don't get to keep mine."
3.0,It's a good wig but...its not as long as shown in the picture.
3.0,"I loved the skirt's design but I'm a 14-16 and hippy, so the XXL I bought didn't fit at all. I guess I should've read the size chart better."
3.0,A very cute swimsuit. I'd have to agree with one of the previous reviews in that you have to squeeeeze your thighs through. Once you get it on it's pretty comfortable. The color is accurate. I'd suggest going up in size for sure.
3.0,Las compre esta chevere pero en la muñeca de una mujer quedó grande.. que se puede hacer ????
3.0,It pinches
3.0,The to is shapeless and dilliwy. It looks okay partially tucked in but not left to hang loose.
3.0,A little on the small side but still cute
3.0,"These hats are fun and the quality is as expected. Three stars, though, because I ordered 5 but only received 4. These were for a time sensitive event, so that was unfortunate to be missing an item."
3.0,"Chinese quality - it's very soft but really cheap and delicate... I'm really wondering what will happen once I wash them the first time... It's definitely not worth 26.99 for both... I paid 12.99 on a day it was on discount. Somehow you would expect both leggins to fit the same but they don't. They grey one is softer and slightly more comfortable, but still tight (especially one leg is tighter than the other one - and I swaer it's not my legs!! LOL). while the black one is a bit rougher and much tighter.<br />Overall satisfied but only because I didn't pay too much for them. AND they are see through enough... so you can't work out in them but definitely use under a dress or long shirts. Also they are a bit shorter than shown in picture."
3.0,It is a okay product. Nothing great. Just okay. It’s not worth what I paid but it will do. I am 160 lbs and 5’5... I ordered a Large. I think I could have went down a size... my complaint is the shoulder is kinda big. I wouldn’t wear a tank under it.
3.0,"White purse is actually cream colored.  Cute though.  Larger than expected.  I'll keep it anyway.  Nice edges.  Good size pockets, etc."
3.0,A very cute headband...but had hot glue strings that I had to pull off before I put it on my baby.
3.0,I LOVE the looks of the shorts.  The quality is poor.
3.0,Cute but I wish the pattern continued on the back of the earring.
3.0,I bought this to clean up my white NMDs thinking it would help to get rid of the stubborn stains that warm water and dish soap can't do. I think that you mind as well just stick to using warm water and dish soap since this won't get it any cleaner than that. Points for nice packaging though. Customer service did reach out but did not respond at all once I inquired about their products effectiveness after trying out and asking for some tips
3.0,Could rip pretty easy on the side.
3.0,"I ordered two  -- ivory and white. The &#34;ivory&#34; is yellow, which isn't even a color choice but there is no mistaking it. The white one has to be a return. There are fuzzies inside the cups (like it's been washed and dried!) and it stinks to high heaven of perfume, which is a very bad thing for me because I suffer from chronic migraines triggered by strong smells. It is definitely going back. The bralette itself is comfortable and fits reasonably well. I admit that I was worried because of the fact that the straps are not adjustable. I am currently losing weight and I suspect this may be too large if I continue on my current pace."
3.0,"The shirt fits well, but the neck line is huge. I like my t-shirts to fit better around the neck. It will probably work well with another shirt on top of it."
3.0,To small not cool! Runs 5 times to smallest
3.0,They seem to be good quality however are a very short shaft and the stones aren't evenly spaced.
3.0,I like the design/camo pattern but I dislike that the straps are not long enough to feel comfortable across my chest
3.0,"It just ok ,I don’t like the material feel not comfortable,and it is way too big not flattering on .i am 127 I ordered size small still way to big."
3.0,Love the fabric and the feel but they aren't true to size.  I bought the smallest size and they were still to large and more so in the toe section.  I'm a size 8 1/2 and my husband is a 9 and they were even to big for him.
3.0,My daughter loves them. Good colors and fit snug enough not to fall. Would buy again .
3.0,"Was very disappointed, a few good carnelian pieces most of it throw away scraps of milky white or tiny chunks, don’t waste your money"
3.0,"A little small, but I gave it to a friend"
3.0,"This purse was much smaller than I expected and the opening is not wide enough. If you normally carry a big bag, this bag is not for you."
3.0,Bought for my gf. The charm is perfect. The chain however looks a bit gaudy. It has a weird dark tone to it as well.
3.0,"In casual wear, they have a soft feel and I am hopeful the copper thread will help to keep things fresh downstairs. One note of caution-- these are not good for running. The copper thread feels quite abrasive against the, um, equipment."
3.0,Pretty but too heavy for my ears.  I really liked them too but I had to return them.
3.0,"I groom dogs for work and am constantly bathing dogs. These pants are not waterproof at all, and the zipper broke on one of the pairs. Comfort-wise they are okay, although I would size up if you’re plus sized, they run small."
3.0,"I wish they were a little better but they look nice on my pinkys just very small , best thing they dont turn my skin green"
3.0,I got these for my daughter's first birthday along with a couple hatake from gymboree in 12 months. The gymboree hats are a little big and these were pretty small. They fit snug on her head but look awkward. Do not buy for an actual toddler.
3.0,"I ordered this dress to wear to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany next week and wanted something authentic looking.  I'm 5'6"" 140 lbs athletic build and I usually wear a US size 6. I measured myself and according to the chart I should be between a size 6 and a size 8, therefore I thought I would play it safe and ordered a size 8. The size 8 was way too small. The measurements are just flat out inaccurate.  I would recommend sizing up 2 sizes from what the size chart says.<br /><br />The dress itself is beautiful...the fabric is heavy and the stitching is beautiful. It definitely feels authentic and not costumey.  I'm giving this 3 stars due to the grossly inaccurate sizing and the fact that I had to return this dress and did not get to take it with me to Oktoberfest, which was disappointing."
3.0,I have to admit this was one of my favorite bracelets it just doesn't last too long and I'm gentle with my jewelry
3.0,it's nice for the price.  its specially good since baby will only wear it for about a month or two.
3.0,A little on a small side
3.0,"Looks ok. I have a long torso, and the bottom of the bra top still touches the top of the bottoms. I guess I didnt think it would be that high a waist. Cute pattern and well made."
3.0,It got as expected. However the bow came off and the metal bebe came off in less than 5 hours.
3.0,"I liked this but I don't love it on me. The shoulders are wider than I hoped and it feels a bit too baggy looking. It fits right, the design is just a little looser.  The pattern is as you would expect from the picture."
3.0,hard to put on but it does do the job.
3.0,They are beautiful rings but realized after purchase they did not even let me pick a size. When received they were extremely small. They did not fit my sons girlfriends finger or my sons. Ended up passing them to my sons grandma. They fit her tiny fingers perfectly.
3.0,The design is cute and material Is good but the masks are way to big for an average adult's face... I am not able to wear them.<br />Love that they are with filters.
3.0,"These are super tiny Dimonds. ( What i was looking for) Backs are about 4 times as big but they are hard to get on. Then they fall off.. even once tight... i had to gage my ears for them to fit, took a few days to get all 6 in.  Although, they are super cute, and soo fn comfortable to sleep in! I'd totally buy agian, or buy extra backs. I love them!"
3.0,"Very stylish especially with the pink NF logo, although glove is not warm enough even for LA, but etip function sure does very well. Would have been 5 stars if glove provides more warmth."
3.0,"Not what I expected.  I was hoping for something that gripped the floor a bit better, for Barre and Yoga classes, but these did not do the trick.<br />Also very tight around the 4 side toes. Fit well everywhere else though."
3.0,"Though I thought I had ordered them by the right size, everything about these glasses was too small for me ... too small for a man, in a way.  But i think the lenses worked.  However, even tho the design was sort of general, there were small details that made them more obviously for women.  I think they may have been sized for women also.  I haven't passed for a woman ... ever ... as far as I know.  At my age I barely pass for human.  I occasionally see old guys humped over their walkers and wearing women's glasses ... usually for the somewhat practical advantage of the rhinestoned chain around their neck ...  but those guys look pretty silly to me, and looking silly when i don't absolutely have to has never been in my repertoire.  Anyway, at the very least, this particular pair of readers was way too tight and cramped my face AND my style, so I chucked the glasses and sought out a different pair ... also purchased through amazon and also also reviewed by me."
3.0,"For the price the skirt is perfect but runs a bit large,  I normally wear a size 10-12 and ordered a Large but could've used a Medium. The material feels good and looks great, not cheap at all, but because it's too big isn't flattering."
3.0,Mas ò menos .!!
3.0,Not bad for the price. Magnetic clasp still works and colors are still vibrant.<br /><br />Whatever black “paint” they used on the leather straps wore off after only a few wears (and never in any water). Makes it look a little junky.
3.0,fit a little sm
3.0,I purchased two of these tops. Thinking these were non-US sized clothes I ended up ordering at least a size too big. Not the end of the world but they are now winter pajama tops as they are just too baggy/boxy to wear out.  (Not worth the hassle of exchanging)<br /><br />What puzzles me is the arm length.  Wearing the top naturally the sleeve cuffs hit me slightly longer than mid-forearm.  I can pull them down further but then the seams under the arms are too low and it fits oddly.<br /><br />The material is really soft and slightly heavier than a tee-shirt.  I find it super comfortable for lounging on the couch in.
3.0,"I'm not impressed with the quality & make of this bodysuit. I'm a size 6, and got them in 6-8 (large) base on the size chart & customer reviews - fits a bit too large. A medium would have worked better. For reference, I'm 34DD, 28, 39 - 140lbs & 5'9&#34;."
3.0,"the color that arrived is very gold and shiny. not antique at all. other than that, i like it."
3.0,"The heart doesn’t really look like a heart, but it wasn’t expensive so I’m ok with it."
3.0,typical converse...
3.0,"Purchased a L, too tight in the arms and back when I cross my arms."
3.0,"I work as a diesel mechanic so i bought these gloves so people wouldn't take my gloves ""accidentally"". Within the first week they started to tear."
3.0,"I thought this would make a nice gift but upon receiving it, I realized that this outfit is more like a tunic than a dress."
3.0,Really oversized and Linda hangy. Ok for around the house or pool but not a dress to wear out like I had hoped. The stitching was not well done on corners and strap areas. Not very good construction
3.0,"Measured myself before purchasing, but it looks to be about 2 sizes smaller. Very nice looking jacket otherwise, would have been perfect."
3.0,This should really be advertised as a choker and not a necklace because it barely hangs. Color is great though the paint missed a few chips. If not for the length I would keep it but I need something longer.
3.0,It fits okay.<br />5' 6&#34; 150# bought medium.<br />No tag and not as flowy as the picture
3.0,"I liked the colors, however, it snags real easy on things and it unraveling. I didn't realize this is not US sizing. Will not buy China or Europe sized clothes again."
3.0,Pants are super thin. Quality is not that good
3.0,I like it okay
3.0,"I agree with another reviewer this product is EXTREMELY thin for an 11-12 year old girl. There is no type of padding to help conceal anything and due to the way it is made strappy back, it is difficult to figure out what to wear under it. Fits on the large side. Very cute though. My daughter really liked it."
3.0,"The fit is definitely more flare or bell bottom than wide leg. Not exactly a crop length, more like a normal pant with a petite inseam. They run small. A bit more on the mid rise side than high waisted. Not bad for the price but not what I was looking for"
3.0,"I originally bought these because the shape was intriguing and I liked the color they were. However when I received them I was a bit let down. The first thing I noticed was how reflective they were, it was a big let down for me. They were way too shiny, and also the color of the frame looked alot more yellow than what the picture showed. The lens them self have a weird shade, its like the same type of shade that certain windshields have when ever they after market and cheap so I wasn't too happy with that either. The temple tips however seem to be very well designed though and were comfortable. So in the end, I wasn't too happy with the quality but then again this is a pair of glasses that are 10 bucks, so I cant expect too much."
3.0,"Hat is comfy and fits many sizes of head.  The problem is that the shield is wavy.  So when walking, it actually distorts my vision and makes me dizzy."
3.0,Lost a star for quality - one of the straps snapped off when i put it on and it appears to be poor parts. 3/4 of items sent were fine.
3.0,Cute shoes but you get what you pay for in this case!! Eye balls fell out day one :(.  My daughter wasn’t too happy with them without the eyes!
3.0,Like the overall glasses but they feel stretched out.. almost too big for my head.
3.0,"The 16g 8mm spiked and balls rings are cute but where waaay too small for my septum. Idk if the 12mm will be better, but the 8mm are too small. Other than that, they are cute."
3.0,Way too big will save for when baby is bigger.
3.0,"Came on time, and looks as pictured. However, it's smaller than expected. Probably will give it to a younger cousin because it doesn't look mature enough to me."
3.0,"Great Fit for 2 year old, sizing is right on. Quality of sewing is iffy. Had 2 weeks and already a seam has ripped and stuffing is coming out."
3.0,"it's pretty, the only reason, I gave it a 3 stars, because this is definitely not for women, but for little girls 6-7 years old"
3.0,These shoes rub the inner side of my feet raw every time I put them on. They are uncomfortable whether I’m moving or standing still.
3.0,"It seems fine and looks like the photo, except it's cartoonishly huge so I'm returning. Strap looks ok, but was bent in the packaging and cracking a bit. If you are looking for a medium sized watch, this ain't it."
3.0,... the string breaks and beads go flying all over the bus!
3.0,"They are beautiful, but much smaller than the description ."
3.0,"I loved the fabric and design of this jacket, but the sizing was much smaller than expected.  (Too narrow in the shoulders.)  Rather than returning, I gave it to a friend."
3.0,"It was huge when I bought it. Then I washed it. It went from mid calf to knees and sleeves got tight. Became unflattering due to belly cling. I am 5'4"" and 215 lbs. With 44 bra size and 40"" waist. I got the 3xl based on charts. Order larger size than recommended."
3.0,Advertised with high cotton content. Definitely not
3.0,"It was a very cute summer dress but if you are chesty like myself, this dress might not be for you. I never had the chance to wear it. The fabric has no give what a shame. This dress is prefect for a smaller chest."
3.0,The quality of this hat is great especially for the price point. It appears that it will hold up well. My issue was with the packaging. The box was half the size of the hat and when I opened it the hat was folded the size of a New York slice of pizza. I was a little embarrassed to gift it with the bend creases.
3.0,"Pretty, classy & fun earrings but were uncomfortable for me & the clasps are very cheap, others may not have any issues."
3.0,"No laces. They're okay, especially for the price. My child wanted yellow shoes, and I couldn't find any that were plain, or that weren't too loud; except for these. I'd have appreciated laces or the stretchy cord lace thing (for little kids). I'm not sure if they'll last very long, they seem a bit cheap."
3.0,The purse looks cheaper than what it cost. I normally don't order a handbag online but I needed something quick but it didn't go as expected.
3.0,"Although I really like the look of this watch, the watch face is MUCH bigger than I anticipated. I have a very small wrist and am not sure if i will keep this watch as the face makes it look gigantic!"
3.0,Compression on foot inconsistent due to different heel and toe material.  EKG pattern fun but leaves marks on legs!
3.0,"The swimsuit fit for the most part (size L), but I was hoping for a better fit in the bust area.  I am 5' 7&#34; and a 34G and was hoping for better support from the underwire.  I realized there is a big difference between a swimsuit with underwire and one with a &#34;bra fit&#34;.  Other than that, I would have totally been satisfied.  I hope this helps."
3.0,"The high resolution photos are a little misleading. The actual product is not as clear as the photos advertised. I wish the elephant 🐘 was a little larger and the pic clearer . However, for $6 i think is a fair product"
3.0,"Looked like I was ordering glasses with polarized yellow lenses. I was wrong. Polarized yes, yellow lenses, no."
3.0,Good looking but flimsy. Mine have broken after a couple months use.
3.0,"Love the bottoms, but I got 40 of Sofia and Caleb and I was expecting 30 for kids and 10 regular of jw.org which didn't happen... so what you are going to do about this?"
3.0,"It was okay, Just didn't look the greatest on and a bit short..."
3.0,Was hoping they would work if my husbands glasses and they didn’t. So we haven’t got to try them.
3.0,He liked it but for me it was smaller than what I thought.
3.0,Unfortunately it was too tight around my mid section. I should have gone with an extra large.
3.0,Order up! Being busty I didn’t stand a chance in this ! And I recommend finding another belt for the ppl who are a little bigger
3.0,Doesn't glow in the dark... pretty disappointing my daughter would have loved that
3.0,"I not crazy about this bag although it is well made and feels nice when worn crossbody. There isn't anyplace (i.e.outside slip pocket) that fits my phone (Galaxy S8) on this bag. I knew this before purchase, but hoped my phone would fit in the outside zip pocket, but it doesn't"
3.0,cheap looking but I needed it for a costume party
3.0,Material is very cheap .Didn't like the design at all .<br />Had to return.
3.0,"I received my bandanas today and I have to report that I am disappointed by them.  Yes, they are the colours advertised.  Yes, the are 27&#34;x27&#34;.<br /><br />But the designs are painted on the surface of one side.  They are not dyed through like every other bandana I have ever bought.<br /><br />The problem, of course, is that designs painted on cloth do not last very long.  The paint will likely come off with a few washes.  Of course they will still be wearable, but if I wanted solid coloured cotton squares, I could have got them cheaply elsewhere.<br /><br />And no, I'm not going to &#34;handwash&#34; as directed on the product tag.  These are advertised for wear on the head by bikers.  Does that sound like something that needs delicate handwashing?<br /><br />I will report how much they shrink when I wash them.  I'm guessing they'll shrink a lot because they are cotton.  And that is expected.  But what I did not expect was that the designs would go away."
3.0,Has a hole in one of them from elastic degrading.
3.0,Very cute. But super thin chain and clasp.. my daughter (16 yr old) wore it once and lost it.
3.0,I wish it was a little bigger
3.0,"Not as expected. I ordered a pair of these for a bride and her maid of honor...only one arrived in the package marked for both.<br /><br />The dangling pendant with the Gallifreyan writing on it hangs lopsided and is extremely light and cheap. The decoration on the dangling portion is obviously a sticker with a glossy finish on it, and is actually not as detailed up close as one would like.<br /><br />I'm in contact with the seller, but not very happy so far."
3.0,"I loved this dress but it was too tight in the bust area! The length was good, the sleeves were good. Super cute but can't wear it because the bust is just sooo tight."
3.0,"Hi Delicol, I have been struggling with deciding which &#34;style&#34; to purchase. In each of the packs there are about 3 patterns that I like, but the others I am not happy with. Is there any way I can choose 3 from one pack and 3 from another to customize my order? Thanks!"
3.0,"I sent it back, it just didn't work out for me. I wanted to like it, because it's a nice looking shirt."
3.0,"I love the color and coziness of these pajamas and would have ordered another pair but they are too short. I would have given the pajamas  5 stars but they are made for a short person with short arms. I am 5'7"" and don't consider myself very tall but these pajamas are not long enough and are up my arms. They are  definitely cut for a short person.  The fit is fine though just too short."
3.0,"These arrived on time, I brought them because I wanted to be the talk if the skating rink because they have black lights and I wanted to see how they would look. I haven't been able to test them out because the flare on them even though they are silicone they weren't soft enough to squeeze through my ears I am up to a  2 gauge and all my other 2 gauges I order fit fine. I will revisit this review when I get some gauge lube which may make these easier to slide through my ears. Also I wish they had these in flesh tones of all ethnicities, the glow is not as bright as I would want but there is a glow."
3.0,Cute suite but runs very small. Over all it's a cute bathing suit.
3.0,Shipping took a long time. Case is smaller than I thought. Will hold glasses or smaller sunglasses easier.
3.0,Cute but size runs small
3.0,"My 4 yr old HAD to have this hat. Now he has it but doesn't wear it. It fits very snug on his head. The 'pumps' that make the wings flap are too difficult for him to push. In addition the mechanism that makes them flap has come loose several times and requires fixing.  At a price of $25 I feel ripped off, but then again I knew I was being ripped off when I agreed to pay that price.  My rating is more like 2.5 stars"
3.0,Runs small. Size up. It’s really a pretty dress. Just size up.
3.0,These are very small earrings.  Perhaps they are to be used for small children.
3.0,Sometimes it’s hard to see the numbers even they large but number are to clear color n you can’t see well.
3.0,Clamp is small and  difficult to work; hard to attach to my eye glasses.  Work ok when attached.
3.0,Dress is beautiful but it keeps loosing the strings
3.0,"Cute shirts,kind of thin and too small"
3.0,It’s a nice dress but a little cheaply made
3.0,my son was super excited to receive but fabric faded quickly and started “fuzzing” after one wear ( like when velcro gets stuck and ripped off)
3.0,"Really thin, see though material. Feels kind of like wearing a potato sack"
3.0,Some are longer than others.  But they are warm
3.0,I purchased an XL. I'm approx size 16 in bottoms and these fit. The top was a joke. It barely fit and that was really smashing everything in. Don't do this.
3.0,too cheap looking;
3.0,Not terrible.  Its not thick but the fabric is soft.  I debated about keeping it but in the end I returned it.  I'm not a fan of the ruffles and high neck on this dress on me.
3.0,The neckline and hem should have been hemmed and not stitched. The black thread cutting across the white pulk a dots at the neckline and the hem line cheapens the look and overall quality of the finish on this dress.  It would have been pefect if I could not see the black thread showing on the white dots. Otherwise it fits perfectly.
3.0,"I love the color and quality of these pants. They are stretchy like yoga pants and very soft and comfy. They even have an elastic waistband. But, the crotch area is WAY to big and hangs low."
3.0,The quality is very nice even though I don't know how it will wash.  This a fall or spring scarf but not for winter.  It does not feel warm.
3.0,The pendant can be reinforced so that it doesn't come out after one use!<br />Otherwise it's elegant!
3.0,I love it! But does not fit or comfortable:/ wish the bar was longer or the tentacle was smaller
3.0,Loved this item.  Runs small so size up ladies!!!
3.0,"This has ""women"" in the title but it's definitely for kids. I can't even fit my phone in here without taking off the case (which I'm obviously not going to do) and even with the case off it's a very tight fit. I can't imagine this being used for anything practical, this would purely be decorative which really sucks since I bought it to actually use. It barely even fits my wallet."
3.0,I like the length to go with longer skirts and the material of the slip itself is nice but the waist band is a little tight and the lace a little scratchy. I am comparing these to the vanity fair petti-pants i bought long ago  but unfortunately have been unable to find those. They were so comfortable and so well made and these are a decent substitute.
3.0,"While this scarf looks lovely, their are so many fuzzies that I'm constantly pulling fibers off my clothes and out of my eyes."
3.0,"The pendant looks well made for the price, but the disc in the middle is off-center and the picture inside is faded."
3.0,"This dress in a yellow medium which is my size was way too short. I am 5""6. It was also a bit thin a see through. I got the same dress with a pattern blue with flowers and it was longer enough and didn't seem as seen through."
3.0,"good service, looks good but needs a better fastener"
3.0,"Short. Might wear it as a tunic instead. Beautiful fabric, just mediocre design"
3.0,"The sunglasses fit nicely and wasn't difficult to swap out the lenses.  Good assortment of lens options.  The carrying case is nice as well.  My only issue with the glasses is that they fog up easily.  On humid days I can barely see out of them if I'm cycling at a lower speed (up hills) or not getting enough wind to dry them.  If this is an issue for you, look to spend a little more on anti fog lenses."
3.0,Comfortable and nice looking<br />Longer in the legs than expected<br />pocket placement isn't the best<br />would not buy again
3.0,Loved the pendant but was expecting a chain with it so still haven't worn it even after 6 months
3.0,"50/50 on this one, expected a better print and fit but its ok."
3.0,"The quality and fit of the suit are good, but the print is upside down on the front of the suit (the toucans are upside down). My daughter usually wears size 7-8 and the size 8 fit her well."
3.0,disappointed - wanted the glossy red as in the picture - it came in a dull burnt orange - which they consider red - reached out to company with no response.  Quality of sunglasses are good.
3.0,Fell apart after a few uses.
3.0,"These are darling and the silver will be fine, but the gold look too brassy to use on a gold necklace."
3.0,The guacamole is great! The salsa costume not so much. It looks like blood smeared rather than salsa.
3.0,I got an extra large and it is very small. I normally wear a large but got one a bit bigger and it still is rather small especially in the chest.
3.0,"Get a size up,it's a lovely jacket just wish I had gotten a side bigger"
3.0,I normally wear a large but went up a size and it was still a bit snug.
3.0,Slightly ill-built. I can’t put my finger on it but something is off with the fit of this tee. I’ll still deal since it’s just a workout shirt but not quite right. It is true to size and not too clingy on the midsection.
3.0,Loved the shoes but ran smsll.  Returned for exchange.  I had to pay for shipping return.  I hope they will reimburse me.
3.0,"Half the ""phrases"" were badly translated english that makes no sense 2 look like they are supposed to be bible saying rendering them unusable. Will not rebuy."
3.0,I have not worn the dress only tried it on to see how it looked on me so i will have to return it now. Amazon will refund me so they have helped out with this problem of returning and possibly re buying another dress more suited and correct fit for me.
3.0,Interesting device  for those interested in &#34;mindfulness&#34; while practicing Tai Chi.
3.0,Hat came severely wrinkled
3.0,Cute slippers but took a long time to receive them.
3.0,"I wear soft orthotics and New Bal (1540) sneakers.  I stand often due to back problems.  At home, I had to put the Warren orthotic back in and then my soft orthotics - which is not a good fit but offered more comfort when standing in front of my computer.  I also stand on a gel mat too, so I have difficult foot problems.  The soft orthotics did fit good when I took the warren orthotic insole out, but not comfortable enough sandal for me to walk around in or stand in when going past an hour during the day.  I bought the sandal due to hot foot problems and a toe fungus which the Dr said wear open toe shoe until I get rid of the fungus."
3.0,"This dress is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. We were completely devastated when the waist fit perfectly- if not a little tight, but the bodice gaped at the bust and shoulders. My daughter is 5 foot two and 100 pounds, the small fit nicely from the waist down, but from the waist up it was a disaster fit wise. You would have to be extremely busty to fill it out without gaping. It almost seem like the top and bottom or not sized the same. So we are sending it back with tears in our eyes, it would’ve made a fantastic gown if it had fit better."
3.0,The shoulder cut outs aren't that big.
3.0,"It looks cute, but is not the most comfortable to wear.  If this had a buckle closure instead of the snaps it would be perfect, but I have a smaller sized neck and have to go on the tightest snap which leaves a good couple inches that hangs awkwardly and will chafe the back of my neck.  It will rub and itch after a while and I've found myself having to take it off partially through the day because it gets so uncomfortable.  Wish the design was better. If you have a tiny neck, this is not the collar for you."
3.0,"this one was ok.  the other one, lighter brown/beige is a disaster.  no seams on the back, big seam in front.  very noticeable, very ugly.  would like to wear back to front BUT back is longer...  so beige one goes to goodwill."
3.0,"This shirt is cute. I bought for work, it’s too short. It’s more like a belly shirt."
3.0,"Super cute pattern but I couldn't wear it. It fits everywhere perfectly except the straps. They were awkward and would stay up. I tried it on 3 different body types, the results were the same."
3.0,Smaller than I expected.  That little gem that you see in the picture you cannot see on the actual letter.
3.0,I have wide shoulder and it doesn't look like strapless shirt like in picture.  More like a regular shirt but it still cute.
3.0,"I was hoping for a good alternative to Under Armour, but this doesn't meet the mark just yet.  If you got ass, then you may want to order a size larger as these seem to walk off me as I walk.  Pretty good material though and s good price."
3.0,It works and doesn't irritate my ears.
3.0,It was a nice looking watch but the analog time kept getting off from the digital time. I returned it maybe I was doing something wrong I'm not sure but I found a different g-shock with a lot more features for about $40.00 less so I went with that one. But like I said it is a nice watch maybe I had a setting wrong. if all you want is a good looking watch without specific features this is it.
3.0,"This 8&quot; Two-tone Silver and Gold Heart Bracelet features 14 Alternating Silver and Gold Heart Links measuring 7/16&quot; x 5/16&quot; each.<br />Only the upper portion of the Silver Hearts are silver in color, The Underside of the bracelet is solid gold in color.<br />The links are securely connected with watch style pins, which are removable should you need to resize the bracelet for a proper fit.<br />Due to the way the links fit together, I would suggest letting a jeweler adjust the size, rather than risk breaking the thinner portion of the link by trying to remove them yourself.<br /><br />It secures to the wrist by way of a Notched 3/8&quot; Fold Over style Locking Clasp which was Very Difficult to open, but assures that the bracelet will not fall off my wrist once the clasp is locked.<br />The Opposite End of the Clasp features a Small Pin which Must be Properly Positioned Inside the Notch to enable the clasp to lock.<br />The Opening through which the Fold Over piece fits is Narrow and quite honestly I found the clasp Extremely Difficult to Manipulate.<br /><br />Although the listing says 18k Gold Plating, it also states that there are No stamps or marks on the bracelet to verify that the plating is indeed 18k.<br />While inspecting the bracelet, I notice several tiny pit marks on both the front and backside of Every link.<br />Also, the plating is not very thick and appears to have been applied with a brush. There are &quot;hair&quot; lines across the front and back of each link which are visible when I hold the bracelet under a light.<br />The overall finish is smoothly polished which allows the light to reflect off the bracelet, but also allows any fingerprints left behind while putting it on to be easily seen, so I would advise wiping the links with a polishing cloth once you have it secured to your wrist.<br /><br />Orangelove ships the bracelet inside of a Burgundy Gift Box with a Red Satin Ribbon glued to the box top. However, the box is just a tad too short to allow the bracelet to remain centered and flat for presentation if gifting the bracelet.<br />The bracelet is Attractive and Well Constructed and for that I would have given 3 1/2 Stars had Amazon allowed me to do so.<br />I received mine at a discounted cost in exchange for evaluation and offering my honest, unbiased opinion, which I have provided.<br />It may be worth the asking price, but unfortunately, it doesn't offer the quality I would expect from a $29.99 bracelet that is being offered on sale for $9.99."
3.0,These are really pretty but I was missing a couple pieces and some of the others were cracked at the top. I'm using them to make earrings so it means that I'm short a few pair. If the quality control was better I'd purchase again.
3.0,Came very wrinkled. Not sure if it can be thrown into the dryer. I normally wear size 0 or xs in clothes and this was a bit large on me. Length was okay (I'm 5'4).
3.0,"The fabric is much thinner than I expected but very soft & comfortable. Too small in hips but fit great in bust & length was perfect. I'm 5'5 and wear size 14-16 and XL was tight in hips, but I have curvy hips. Otherwise dress was as described"
3.0,Fit was tighter than expected but it's a great dress
3.0,"I ordered one size up just in case. Still a bit tight about the bust.<br /><br />Nice material, great length (I'm 5'4&#34;). Just tight in the bust"
3.0,"Smaller and lighter than expected. Feels more plastic than silver, but it is fine."
3.0,"First of all I ordered multiple colors. They were shrink wrapped and the wrinkles are awful. Wrinkles upon wrinkles in shiny material! The stitching is also very uneven with lots of thread showing.  If I didn't know better, I would have guessed this was a ""Wish"" or ""Aliexpress"" item . Disappointed."
3.0,I will pin the front as the slit in the front is MUCH wider than shown.  I'm hopeful I can make it work as it is a comfortable material and pretty.
3.0,I mean it’s cute and all but the ball fell off within a week of having it which totally sucked. That never happens with me with belly rings so idk if it was user error or what.
3.0,The ones I received are slightly different than the ones from Walmart. They still fit but are a little more difficult to get on and off the glasses.
3.0,Not bad but you get what you pay for. Well packaged.
3.0,cheaply made mask.Not as well made as the original mask .Will not buy from this supplier again!
3.0,Don't order if you have a thick neck and want to wear them right away! I just got them and I put it on and it clicks but I can't breathe at all. I love them they're so pretty I just need to get extensions for them
3.0,Product is as described but look very carefully. The materials are cheap. I returned these.
3.0,"Beautiful color however, i have narrow shoulders so it didn't fit right in the shoulder area."
3.0,They are way too big for my 5 year old son. But they are great sunglasses.
3.0,It’s so cheaply made. But I guess for the $6-7 you spend on it it’s not bad. But definitely something even the “not so crafty” person could have made themselves.
3.0,I did not like the material; dress was too thin and not flattering at all!
3.0,Smail bad
3.0,These were too small for my 8 year old brother. I had bought these for him because he likes the design and needs sunglasses because he’s sensitive to light from the chemo he’s going through. These weren’t dark enough and barely blocked any sun at all.
3.0,"These are really nice, i bought them for my third baby. I have learned that the less you have the less you loose. They fit my 8lb 8oz baby big, but they still stayed on better than the other kinds. And they are supper cute"
3.0,I have this for almost 1-year.  It is fun for sure and definitely a novelty splurge.  It keeps feet warm so long as you are not in sub-degree WI winter.  I do need additional socks for added warmth.  The foot padding is starting to wear thin taking the shape of my foot-print.
3.0,They run a bit small. Especially the shorts. So size up. But they were very cute!
3.0,The Jade stones were oversize for the mounting allowing one of the stones to drop out. Since this was a gift I paid to have them repaired locally.
3.0,I’m a size 6 and the medium was small. Get a larger size
3.0,"Nice fabric, nice fit but needs another layer in the chest area. This way the nipples show. Also the stripe on the top brings focus to absolutely the wrong spot."
3.0,"It’s OK. Not like picture. No slits and there is a tie in the back, also not that low on the back as well."
3.0,"Too short, also a little small, but fast shipping and easy return. A light thin fleece, but nice feel to the fabric."
3.0,"Cute shorts. Zipper pocket on the side is great...once I altered its length. Pocket is way too long. My 2 little house keys managed to pull the pocket to be visible out the bottom of shorts. I cut and stitched the pocket to a more reasonable length,  now the shorts are great. So if you are handy with needle and thread they are great. Very comfy too."
3.0,"Ordered a small hoping the top measurements in the small range would fit, but had trouble pulling the top off. The shorts were a little tight."
3.0,colors didn't look good on me
3.0,It's not the quality of the leather band that came with the watch but it'll do.
3.0,"I love the idea of heated gloves as my fingers get cold when playing in the snow with my kids. My wife has a heated jacket that has a similar idea- there's a battery pack that gets wired up inside and then an external button that activates and glows different colors to indicate what mode it is in. This is the same thing, but on two hands (so double the battery packs and switches!).<br />The jacket version is vastly superior to this in my opinion. To be clear, it DOES work, but there are some design flaws that make it a little frustrating. For starters, the battery pack uses AA cells and not a USB rechargeable pack like other heated items in this style. That's fine, except that the pack is very bulky and hard to get to when you need to change them. There is a zipper pouch that houses it, and you have to really dig around with your fingers to get it out and in. And there's a good chance you'll have to replace them every couple of times you wear this. There is also a ""master power"" switch on the battery pack, which I guess prevents accidentally pressing the power on when storing the gloves as well as preventing background power drain. If left on, the pack will drain your battery even if the glove's heating function is turned off, so you need to dig it out every time and hit the switch (found this out the hard way).<br />Not only is that annoying, it is bulky and won't contour with your arm since it is a square pack. See the attached picture, on my arm that carries my watch, the pack creates this awkward bulge. And it isn't that the gloves are too small on me, in fact they are a bit big on me in every other way.<br />The LED on the gloves also aren't very visible when outside in the snow. I kept questioning whether or not my gloves were on or if in the wrong mode... a few times one had turned itself off perhaps by either the battery dying or accidentally hitting the button. Using them at night solves this, but what if you're outside in the brightly reflected snow? In contrast, my wife's heated jacket is visible.<br />I was going to give this 4 stars because it's just mildly inconvenient and still functional, but after using it a couple of times and finding the batteries are already dead, I decided against putting even more batteries into it and just using them as normal gloves. For that, you can get much better fitting gloves for the price.<br />So, if you really need heated gloves on the cheap, they're OK. But they really could be so much better."
3.0,Like the look ! Great price !! The placement of the bifocal is WAY TOO LOW !!
3.0,I would give it 3 1/2 stars because the boot doesn't really look like leather. They're ashy looking. They're still cute enough but I wanted that leather look. I'll keep them though.
3.0,"The outfit itself is gorgeous, I ordered the orange and grey set. However, a night out on the town ended embarrassing & tragic. The leg of the pants split from top to bottom. My entire leg was exposed! They should re-enforce the stitching, I know it’s cheap but dang smh"
3.0,"I bought it for my Rhodesian Ridgeback (think long ears) to go with his new dog coat.  It keeps his neck warm, but the hood does not stay on his head to keep his head warm.  I will have to figure out something else.  Should be warm and cozy for a human head."
3.0,"Right out of the box, I loved this shirt: the color, the cut, the drape ... all wonderful! Unfortunately, poorly constructed buttonholes make it unwearable.  It appears that the buttonholes are interfaced. Despite this, there are many loose threads in the hole that get caught on the buttons. After two times buttoning and unbuttoning the blouse, the threads have pulled through the buttonholes creating gathers in the shirt front. Such a shame! I am returning this blouse. I will order another and see if I can reinforce the buttonholes before the buttons have a chance to pull the loose threads."
3.0,Gloves worked great but the socks will cut off your circulation unless you're built like olive oil
3.0,"I like how the robe absorbs  water when you get out the shower  ,but after two years im noticing fabric runs an hanging strings that i have to cut"
3.0,Not what I have expected but it's ok. It's kind of nice ( talking from my personal taste)
3.0,The dress has lots of loose threads and loose stitching. There are 2 holes . Not happy with it
3.0,"The third time I used the watch tool the pin that pushes the pin out of the watch band broke. It worked fine before that. I have reordered the watch band pusher from another site, it looks like a heaver product the pins are stainless steel and I have ordered extra pins for it at the same time. It's nice package other than the pin pusher for the watch tool, this seems to be the weak part of the package. Thank you"
3.0,Cheap metal makes my ears swell.
3.0,"cute idea, colorful and light but can see that adjustable fit for glasses does have to be checked due to stretching of the material since glasses have already fallen out of the stretchy holder."
3.0,"My child tried this on and told me it doesn't fully cover the chest.  We'll try a tank top underneath, since the patter in cute and 12 is the biggest size available."
3.0,"The kind with the cinch strap seem more comfortable, and the material is very breathable and won't pass the candle test, you decide for yourself if that's good or bad."
3.0,"It's great, might wanna order one size bigger since its. Little tight."
3.0,"I wore this bag to the store and when I returned, the tassel was gone. It's a cheap bag so I didn't too mad. It'll do what I need. I'm over big purses. This is small buy still roomy inside."
3.0,I can’t get over how nice these two colors go together. The pink is so bright. Both colors make me happy to look at. They’re my favorite. But they were so hard to get on. And too tight. I felt like my circulation was being cut off. One was smaller than the other. They are thick but not thick like wool or thermal socks. Definitely a winter sock for me. My feet get hot easy. They are soft so that’s a plus. It’s all in what you like as for as tightness.
3.0,Love the design of it. Very decent looking earrings. Lightweight and can be wear all day without hurting the ears. However the quality wise not impressed. It looks kinda cheap. I would not gift them to anyone unless they are kids  lol
3.0,"I'd rate this higher, but who expects to dry clean  an $8 dress?"
3.0,"I liked the bracelet, but it was fragile and broke easily."
3.0,The color is a lot lighter than pictured and the material is thin.
3.0,The first pair I ordered had strings falling out everywhere and the eyelet for the drawstring was hanging off. I exchanged them for another pair & there is a hole in the seam on the leg. They were obviously poorly made which is a shame because they are cute and comfortable
3.0,Not super flattering - too loose.
3.0,Good but the leg holes come up a little too high on the sides. If your child is wearing underwear with their tights  the underwear it will show quite a bit on the bottom.
3.0,"I like the color and fabric of this dress.  The army green is a true army green color and not the brighter green shown in the picture.  I wanted the army green color.  The fabric is 85% cotton / 15% spandex, so it's breathable.  The length for me is good for 5' 3"" and is just above my knee.  The flare of the dress falls away from your body, so it's flattering.  The top is more fitted.  It seems true to size.  The only thing I am not nuts about is the location of the pockets.  They are located too high.  They are in an awkward spot, and they don't lay flat.  They kind of stick out.  Other than that l I like the dress."
3.0,They were cute and I liked it the thought of being able to see what I would look like with a nose piercing. It was fairly difficult to attach the magnet on the inside and took quite a while to do it. Then I ended up accidentally scratching it off halfway through the night anyway.
3.0,I love this sport sunglasses because they are very lightweight but the one get the gasses keeps coming of the holder and can not stay in the holder. I have to find away to let it stay in but still love it and I’m using it for driving and is very comfortable fit me perfect
3.0,Too large and three fabric is thin.<br />Maybe right for the right person
3.0,"This jumper is cute and everything. The quality seems pretty good. But I wear a size, weight 146  and this fits but the part by the cooch area was a lil loose than I expected. If you have big hips or butt this might fit you well."
3.0,"The gloves are very warm, and seem to be water resistant,  but the finger hole are cut too short. So, thee is a flap of material at the end if each finger,  making it virtually impossible to pick up or use anything, especially keys."
3.0,"Nice item,  like the compartments and locking mechanism,  but one of my chains came through the seam and got caught.  Put kinks in my chain when I tried to remove it.  If it's loose moving around in your luggage, be aware that chains my slide through the folded seam."
3.0,Smaller than I expected if you order size up one size at least thinner than I expected also
3.0,Strap length is good but size of fabric mask is just as large as the adult sizes and this is supposed to fit a child.  My son is 9 yrs old and it leaves a gap at the bottom of his chin. What’s the point of a mask then!
3.0,Cute boots but not for long term wear.
3.0,Ordered a size medium that was meant for my 5 year old but couldn’t even fit my 3 year old. Quality is great but unfortunately the sizing is confusing. Definitely size up. The hole to put head through is way too small. The glove fingers are long but stayed on. Should have listened to the reviews better. I sized up but should have gone one or even two sizes up.
3.0,"The dress concept is really nice but... I just now received my replacement dress because the first one I ordered was defective also. It was a tear in the front due to poor stitching and the zipper stitches was coming out due to poor stitching, so right when I took it out the bag I noticed so I placed the dress back in the bag and returned within an hour to the Amazon pick up location. I did not ask for my money back only a replacement. The replacement dress just arrived, and it looks as if it is the same dress returned in the same bag, the front tear was mended back and fixed the zipper was not fixed or the replacement dress has the same issue. The stitching at the bottom is coming out. The thread is so poor and cheap. I will have to fix it myself. I do notice most every item I have ever orders from China the garments have poor stitching and the buttons fall off due to poor stitching. Perhaps you work on sewing using better stitching. I say this  because my Mother was a designer and I know how to still get quality at a low cost. I am irritated with this order and I had 9 more dresses in my cart to order. I may just pass."
3.0,I ordered a large when I usually wear a medium.  It was snug and doesn't stretch well for exercising.
3.0,It's nice. Fit is good.
3.0,"I'm pretty disappointed because it fit perfectly but I just didn't have enough hips, so it was awkward on the bottom. There was just too much left over material even when tightened, there was just no way it would fit right on me"
3.0,"Love the purse can't stand the smell that won't go away, I've been airing it out for over 3 weeks now, odor is still there!"
3.0,Doesn't look like the pic
3.0,Runs a little small compared to similar dresses.
3.0,They looked cute on but definitely were on the tight side.<br />Wouldn’t be able to workout in them.<br />And one of the inner thigh seams came undone :(
3.0,"This wallet is adorable. I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. However, it feels like it's not very well made; the little metal snaps that hold this wallet closed feel loose in the wallet after snapping and opening it a few times."
3.0,"Very cute. My daughter is very small (9 % tile high, 21 %tile weight) so I ordered 1 years old size for 1 years old birthday. It fit but it was pretty tight!"
3.0,Was shorter than pictured
3.0,"I've got such a love/hate relationship with Sketchers. They always look so cute in the beginning. They fit well (come in half sizes - yay) and my daughter finds them comfortable. But they also end up looking ratty fast. These aren't as bad as the ones with the blinking lights, but the material on the straps has worn down, and a couple days ago she reported the inside was wrinkly and uncomfortable. The thin satin-like fabric had separated from the insole in both shoes, for no apparent reason. I ended up tearing it out completely. The foam that remains wasn't sticky, as I was concerned it might be, but I'm thinking it's going to break down now. She's only had them about two months:("
3.0,these were bulky looking on my face but they fit over my glasses well. the lenses pop out sometimes but they can be put back in pretty easily. they fit
3.0,"The shirt itself is cute and as pictured. However, it came with a pretty large hole and it's not worth the hassle of shipping it back internationally. The material is very thin so it needs to be worn with an under shirt as well.<br />Update - After contacting the seller, they shipped a replacement at no charge and did not make me ship back the damaged product."
3.0,Top and bottom beads do not stay in place and slide around.
3.0,Items are small
3.0,"I guess it's every shirt from Amazon, I'm almost done getting clothes off here. Image is nice, material is thick and comfy but it's a little short and boxy. There's no shape, almost worse than wearing a man's shirt. This is the 3rd shirt I've bought off here that the description and image were misleading. That's okay though, it makes a good night shirt."
3.0,"I know I ordered this a year ago, I have only used the purse about a dozen times and the strap broke today, would like a replacement, but can’t return."
3.0,"This product is constructed well, but didn't offer as much support as I need."
3.0,"I have ordered size 7-8 for my 7 year old niece. Then, I asked my 9 year old daughter to try it on. It was too big for her, so I returned the leotard. I think that 6-7 would be good for 9-year old.<br />Quality seems to be good."
3.0,It's snug.
3.0,Hope it was really cute but way too large
3.0,These do put good pressure on my legs. The drawback is they put way too much pressure on my toes and are super uncomfortable by the end of the day.
3.0,"Es sumamente halagador pero extremadamente largo, si quisiera estar sentada en la fiesta usaría esto pero como voy a bailar no lo usare así q devolveré el vestido"
3.0,"Great material and the fur trim was beautiful! I didn’t love the boxy cut of the jacket for myself so I ended up returning, wish it was a little slimmer fitting and I definitely would have kept it!"
3.0,"I wish I would have went a size bigger because when the dress stretches, you can see right through it. I'd say it runs a little bit small."
3.0,"I bought this hat for Christmas for my 10 years old son as a Christmas gift. He have a new Samsung A10 phone. It paired the very 1st time, sound is great, he wore it everywhere including around the house and at night to bed, worked beautifully (So I thought)! Until now! We followed the instructions, took the actual controller head piece out in order to wash the hat! During this time my son kept the controller head piece on its charger. Now we're having trouble connecting it back to his phone! I even unpaired it from his phone to pair it again, still not showing up. My son just now told me, the speaker of the 2 part controller head piece does not have a slot in the hat to keep it in place. So he came to me frustrated saying he also had to keep finding the speaker part in his hat to reposition it, in order to enjoy his music. I can return the hat now so he'll just have to use it as a regular hat. I'm going to try to buy him another hat from a differt company & see if we have better luck. I took some pics to show you guys what I'm talking about. In one pic you'll see my finger pointing to too the speaker and an outline where it shows the speaker should be. But that's just it, AN OUTLINE!😂 There's no slot to hold it like it is for the other part of the head piece. I've tried all day to pair this again to his phone, my hubby and tried to pair this to our phones and it's not showing for us & our phone are more up-to-date then my kid! I hope this review help someone. Have a wonderful day!"
3.0,Fabric is just ok.  Runs a little small.
3.0,I's OK - for the price. Certainly a heavy watch. Changing the Date is a PITA. No instructions - but simple functions so not really necessary.Delivery time was acceptable
3.0,"This is a beauty, but the center piece is not stable so it wiggles up and down.  Otherwise, I would recommend it."
3.0,Beautiful works of art but they are so tight. I can manage to get them on but kind of uncomfortable.
3.0,"It's a very nice shoes I bought 2 in different colors to my girl BUT it's not comfortable it's kind of hard at z ankle , if ur girl gonna wear it with light socks (colon) it's gonna be fine but if not then its not really comfortable at all .."
3.0,My husband wears a size 13 shoe.  These socks were to small for him so I gave them to my Grandson who wears a 9.5.  O.k.. if you are looking for an occasional dress sock.  I think that after a few washings they will be wore out.  I received the socks at a discount for my honest review.
3.0,Super flimsy. Great zippers though and multiple sizes. See through very convenient.
3.0,"My wife, a full-figured older woman, tried it on, and it simply was a little tight, even at XL.  Mainly though, it simply didn't look good on her, so we returned it."
3.0,It's a hi-low style which I guess I missed in the description. Or maybe the info was omitted.  It's also much shorted than I thought it would be. I'm 5'9&#34; and it falls 3 inches above my ankles. I will keep it to wear after showering but that's all.
3.0,"I purchased the mermaid style earring and I was so excited about it but truly it's just ok.  They are cute, but they appear much nicer in the pics than in person.  They look a bit cheap in person, but hey they are!  The earrings were just sitting in a plastic baggie without be attached to their respective pieces.  I had to figure out how to put them together and which pieces matched which wasn't too hard, but that is poor packaging.  I will probably wear these for fun s few times and pass them onto my daughter if they don't tarnish too quickly."
3.0,Awful quality and honestly just feel Soo xheap & really thin. HARD PASS
3.0,size was way off...much smaller than expected.
3.0,My son is 3. His shoes are 10. I bought 11.5 for growing room cause he won’t get to wear them really until summer cause of the cold and mud he will hear his boots. These are a 10. They cut on and worked. I’m charging before wrapping. After Christmas I’ll let y’all know how well they work out.
3.0,Though this item was not as expected-not nearly as fitted as pictured-I'll keep it for a beach coverup.
3.0,It's just ok
3.0,Doesn’t look good on all shirts.
3.0,"This was a great purchase, they compliment my features perfectly. They are very veritile & can be worn with both casual & business casual attires."
3.0,It was very tight fitting. I went by the size chart to determine the correct size to order but it was still too small.
3.0,"Lasted 2 month, before coming apart, they were good while lasted, but they dont last, probably would not buy again"
3.0,I usually wear a medium and hot a small and it's still huge!
3.0,Toooooo High waist... I am 5’7 and the pants came right below my breast. Not flattering on my butt and that’s my best asset!
3.0,It did its job but there are multiple seams so figuring which is the front is a trick. The hood has to be on the correct way pulled tight to see through which don't expect to see very well.
3.0,"Cute, but pinched pretty hard with no cushion on either side. My daughter likes them, but they hurt her."
3.0,"They were cute, but didn't last longer than a few wears"
3.0,They fit my son great. Just ordered one month ago and already broken though. Will not order again.
3.0,These aren't the highest quality but they are nice looking.  I ended up returning them because they looked weird in my ears.
3.0,"its cute. fits as expected. I am 5'3 180 and it fits perfect for my size and frame, however I just wish it was not swimsuit material. it makes the dress look cheap(er) than what it could look like if it were another material"
3.0,Sadly these are not good quality. A few of the earrings were broken upon receiving.
3.0,Materials are pretty low quality. Zippers are rough and one pocket was nearly impossible to open. It was cheap so I should expect as much.
3.0,The shoes are too cute but they run a full size large in my opinion.
3.0,"I was looking for something cheap and polarized. I learned that you can test this 2 ways. When looking at your phone vertically, you should be able to see the screen. When turned horizontal, you should see the screen go dark which means the shades ARE polarized. Also, shades will be labeled POLARIZED on the inner part of the shades. These were not. I have a pair that are labeled and passed the phone test so I was certain they were not polarized. Either way, they are cute, light weight, and great for the price."
3.0,It was too small to put anything under it. Needed a bigger size so I returned it. I am a 14 and I got a XL and it just had no room for a sweater
3.0,Definitely size up for an oversized look or if you want to layer which I highly recommend because the inside is extremely scratchy!!! The outside feels soft (why couldn’t the inside feel like the outside?)<br />It’s by the brand SHEIN (there is a SHEIN tag on it) so if you’ve ordered for them you know the quality is poor. The flannel is cute but not worth $40
3.0,Its brilliansilver but design only on one side
3.0,Love the colors but the arms were you too big for my liking.
3.0,Socks were the correct length but very thin.
3.0,"When I got mine, it was all metal and not a single bit of it glows in the dark. Was a bit disappointed."
3.0,"I liked it, the stitching was just too weird so it didn't lay right when on."
3.0,"The color is beaut but the material is not soft. It is indicated that it will get softer after washing it, I have not done it yet."
3.0,I didn't like the material. Not stretchy. Just an okay shirt
3.0,It was way too pink... like fushia colored. I had ordered Purple.
3.0,Not made for larger busts. Cute and fun to wear
3.0,When I turned it on it worked and it was perfectly fine. Then I put it away for the night and the next morning I turned it on and it said ok then it showed a X and kept repeating the pattern.
3.0,I like the comfort of the jacket. I used it for church.
3.0,State of Oregon is cut off due to bad stitching.
3.0,Hat a bit much. Gloves very good.
3.0,Watch is As per derscription. Perfect polished. Love the dial
3.0,"I really love their product every time I have worn out the product I replace it with another, I NEED THE EXTRA EXTRA LONG PLEASE"
3.0,"I have had the belt for two weeks and noticed it is broken today. I wear my belts in the office environment and have probably worn this no more than 6 times so far. See pics :( Going to look into returning it...<br /><br />However, it's a nice belt and love ratchet system is awesome and makes wearing a tucked in shirt really comfortable."
3.0,I like it’s a pajama can’t really go wrong but I will say after a few washes the material starts to feel weird and my hand gets attached to it
3.0,Not as defining as my other HD glasses.
3.0,"Great hoodie, very soft and cozy to sad that the size was too small :("
3.0,Nice...Good for price...
3.0,"While this jacket fits just fine in the body, the sleeves were too short for me. The sleeves end about two inches from my wrist and I can't extend my arms without the sleeves receding ridiculously. Additionally, the lining extends out of the left sleeve, which makes the jacket look a tad sloppy. I really like the embellishments on the jacket; it's a shame I won't be able to wear it often."
3.0,"Fit was ok. Didn’t like that you could see the stitches around the collar.  Made it seem like it was unfinished, not deconstructed."
3.0,Smaller than expected! Still good though.
3.0,Very pink.
3.0,I wish the the bull head and star was a little bigger
3.0,"I am 5' tall and weigh 110 pounds, generally wear a 4 or a small. However, when I ordered the small, it was so tight that I couldn't even button it up. So I returned the small and ordered a medium. However, the medium was still just a touch too tight and VERY short on me. So I returned the medium and ordered a large. The large fits me perfectly, and it is a perfect length. While it is a really cute skirt and I will most likely end up keeping it, I am frustrated that this product was not true to size."
3.0,"I wear women’s size 10 wide shoes, so I got the XL size of these socks.  They are actually a little big on me, so they’d definitely fit feet bigger than mine.<br /><br />The socks are made of a wool blend fabric that is a little scratchy.  They don’t bother me when they’re on, but may bother people with sensitive skin.<br /><br />The socks are pretty thin, with extra cushioning in the toe and heel areas.  There’s not really a seam in the toe area which is nice. The socks taper in at the arch for extra support.<br /><br />I had no issues washing and drying the socks in a regular load of laundry.  The colors are accurately depicted in the pictures.<br /><br />I’m rating this item 3 stars: it’s okay."
3.0,The material was very very cheap and was much shorter than expected. Ended up returning it.
3.0,They feel and look more like spanks. You can see through them very easily.  The waste was comfortable. I’ll wear them under clothes instead of as yoga pants.
3.0,"The jacket is ok, but mine arrived with a tear in the collar.  The inner shell and outer shell are not connected by the tag.  I thought about returning it the day I received it, but I decided to sew it disconnected parts together."
3.0,"I love the hat. It’s very solid and feels good. I gave only 3 stars because it had a ravel on the bill when I got it. Other than that, I’m very pleased with the hat."
3.0,"I'm 502, 116lbs. A medium was way too small for my 34Bs, it accentuated the love handles I didn't know we're so apparent, and the torso length was quite short. It was also way too small for my sister who is the same height but weighs 105lbs. I just might get a bigger size because I still like the style and the quality."
3.0,"They are very soft, and very warm. Sometimes too warm, and my feet will sweat inside them. They are sturdy on the outside which is great, but sometimes when slipping my feet out of the shoe, the inner lining will pull out with it. Excellent slippers for doing chores around a cold home, but I do not expect the lining to last long. The only other complaint that I have is that the upper vamp does press against my foot more than I'd like."
3.0,"It's not long enough,"
3.0,Really cute but the top fit great and the bottom was super small.
3.0,Meh.... It's ok for the price. I expected more from it but it's not too bad. It has a very strong (cheap) leather smell from the factory.
3.0,"Literally only chose this pair of leggings because it had so many good reviews about not being see through and THEY WERE SEE THROUGH. Granted it isn't terrible, but squats are definitely a no, and idk if I'll even run in them. The fit is good, just wish they were a thicker material or something."
3.0,"This is a really cute dress with fun quirky details. The cautions about &#34;Asian&#34; sizes should be taken in to consideration. I'm tallish, slim and wear a 32DD.  Basically, none of it fit right. I'm bummed because it's a really unique dress, just not for me."
3.0,"Please post size of the item, MSK Embellished Chiffon Blouse.  Thank you!"
3.0,This was an impulse buy and I’m really not the biggest fan. I plan on taking pics in them and I’m sure they’ll work for that. But these are probably not the ideal ears you’re gonna be looking for if you’re looking for one like the trendy bunny hat look. I just wish I had looked at other brands tbh lol but that’s my bad. i wish the inside was just a different color and a different material and that the ears were more controllable.
3.0,"With a great big bottle of hand sanitizer, I was looking forward to decanting into smaller bottles for on-the-go.<br />I understand that it's a fine line between getting a flip top strong and tight enough to stay closed, yet loose enough to open easily.<br />It could very well be that I got a bad batch, but each and every flip top was so hard to open that I had to not only use two hands, but also struggle a bit. Sometimes more than a bit.<br />Closing them is easier, but you still have to press very hard to get them to snap closed all the way.<br />All that aside, they're actually very nice bottles. I will not be able to use the flip top, I will have to unscrew the bottle each time I want to use some hand sanitizer.<br />If you have extremely strong hands, and don't have any fingernails that might get broken, maybe these will be all right for you. It's also a possibility that after opening and closing 10 or 20 times, they would loosen up. Unfortunately, I don't have it in me to open them up even once or twice.<br /><br />also I'm not sure if this makes a difference, but the bottles I received are slightly different than the photograph in the sale listing. Three stars just in case there was some sort of mix-up in what was received."
3.0,"I like to make rosaries, they are great if you are going to use these as a gift. DO NOT get this set if you are planning to resell them if you make jewelry. Remember what you are buying, they are silver in color. (NOT REAL SILVER) They fade over time and turn darker, I'm ok with this because I don't have to worry about unhappy customers with the color changing because family and friends know its made with love. Someone paying you for this to be used in a product will not be so understanding. xox"
3.0,The pants run large in my opinion.  The leg length and width were both shorter/wider than I expected.
3.0,Not really impressed with the quality. But for the price I can't complain.
3.0,"Was disappointed the red box as shown in description was not sent with earrings.  I didn't realize the size in milimeters. Size good for child only, not adult."
3.0,I can fix it by sewing it up but a bit disappointed that it’s falling apart already. Otherwise it’s perfect. I wear a size 8 USA women’s jean and the strap has to be fully expanded to fit around my waist
3.0,"This product was a true XL. Im so used to ordering up a size on amazon. It was surprising to get a true to size blouse. The fabric is static prone and collects hair. It's cute when its fresh out of the wash. It's an odd texture, but tolerable. I wear it like a baggy sweater and it works."
3.0,Be sure to iron on a low setting. I was ironing this dress for my daughter & the colors started bleeding over into the white. Totally ruined the dress
3.0,Returned size description not accurate.
3.0,This  one  is  large.  I  will reorder  in  a  smaller  size.  All  other  swimsuits  were  fairly  consistant  sizewise  in  this  brand.  I  recommend  to  all  future  customers  to  order  one  to  two  sizes  smaller.  I  was  disappointed.  But  i  do  love  this  swimsuit  style.  Great  for  lap swimming  and  aqua  activities.
3.0,"Hat description and image are still not correct.  Good quality hat but , again, image and description are not what I got."
3.0,"Bras are expensive, so when on a budget it can be difficult. This one fits well, is very comfortable, but I'm noticing fraying around where the strap attaches to the cup. Less than 1 month in. In a pinch it works, but won't be repurchasing"
3.0,"I ordered the tan.  I expected it to be as pictured, but it is actually a dark brown.  Not worth returning."
3.0,"Not exactly what I thought it would.  Doesn't seem to be doing the job as well as I had hoped, but have only tried it with one ring.  Might need to try it with another."
3.0,Cute but hem does not match up :(
3.0,Can’t charge watch while on band .horrible
3.0,"Beautiful fabric and the fit is perfect and as expected. However, after just 2 wearings, the back pocket is falling off ( ripped at the seams). The tailor can fix this, but it’s costly!"
3.0,"Not as thick as some reviews lead you believe, the cheap ones are about the same. However they saved our Disney trip!  Mother in law kept hers on for over 4 hours before it ripped."
3.0,VERY PRETTY BUT THIN FABRIC... GOOD FOR SUMMER BUT OLDER LADIES BEWARE.
3.0,"These fit somewhat larger than the size it shows. And I wasn’t a huge fan of how stiff the leather was, ended up returning them. And a bit way too shiny for me"
3.0,Small and very average
3.0,It was too small so I gave it to a friend and it looks great on her!
3.0,A little sloppy looking and material is flimsy.
3.0,They are very cute for little girls but they don't really hold up very well when it comes to keeping them tight on there glasses.  The clips that holds the glasses on comes loose all the time and constantly have to keep putting them back on.  They are great for style but not as great for being helpful in keeping them on little ones heads.
3.0,"Grandson was super-hero happy when he FINALLY received this shirt - it was rather pricey I think, though, especially with the time it took to ship and be received.  I will likely buy &#34;rare&#34; items from here, but after this was pending, I found it locally for half the cost and would have had it for an occasion I wanted to celebrate.  Again, grandson was ecstatic - I just didn't like the cost/wait time."
3.0,Really cute but the neck was too big.
3.0,Bought these shoes 2 months ago for my daughter for school.  Not much of walking to and from school ( I drive her to school).<br />These shoes didn't even last 2 full months.  First shoes that after such a short time are trash.<br />Very disappointed.
3.0,"Cute, but it definitely runs small.  Has thin, stretchy material."
3.0,I think it's a child's size. I fit in 6 but it does not fit and it's very short.  I don't really have a butt. It's more like something I would put on a child over their dance leotard  Good quality though.
3.0,you pay for what you get. the cuts on the bottom are quite weird.
3.0,These were pretty but really long.
3.0,A bit too loose hard to move hands.
3.0,The pants where made nicely but the they run small and I thought they had a shine to them. That the main reason I sent the back because of the shine.
3.0,"Really liked the boot, however they were to narrow."
3.0,"I usually wear an XL shirt, but this shirt was HUGE on me. Im 5' tall and the neck line goes down about mid boob, and the shirt is very long! It is super cute though... Just wish it was smaller!"
3.0,"They look nice, but way too big for my average sized 5 year old boy. They would just fall down."
3.0,"This shirt is super comfy, the only issue is that I am heavy chested so it is see through in the chest :("
3.0,I didn't get the neck strap otherwise I would have given a higher rating
3.0,"Good quality, but order a size larger than you normally wear"
3.0,"We have a couple pairs of paper ""fireworks glasses"" that are 10 or 15 years old. The old glasses work with having to look directly into a light source. The rainbows appear anywhere you look. They are sharp, brilliant and plentiful.<br />These glasses I ordered from Amazon are pretty lame in comparison. You have to look directly into a light to get a few faint rainbows - nothing like the picture shown. The kids seemed happy effort with them on the 4th of July. But I was extremely disappointed."
3.0,The chain on the clasp broke immediately- we were able to repair it with another chain from a different piece of jewelry.
3.0,"One broke after a few months. I have to adjust them a lot. And they aren't as picture, they don't &#34;keep it one spot&#34;"
3.0,Kinda see through at the butt and if you walk a lot the inner thigh parts of the material will slowly disapear. They where cute tho. Need better thicker material.
3.0,"I like them, a bit too thin for my comfort. They did keep my wrists semi warm in the freezer of an office  The only thing that didn’t like was it took a long time to get them because they were shipped from China. But overall all, I’m happy with my purchase."
3.0,The tail on the jacket is shorter than indicated in the picture.  It only covers slightly below the hip area.  Somewhat  disappointed in this purchase.
3.0,Like most other sunglasses out there these are a bit big for my face. I will be using for spare's in my car.
3.0,"Great designs, but too large for a woman to wear without them slipping down"
3.0,They arent long enough to fit into my piercing AND put the O ring on.
3.0,The clasps broke the first time I put on a pair but i just but metal backs on and they still are wearable. Cute for the price.
3.0,The band on the watch we received was a brown leather and not like the picture. The face is extremely large.
3.0,"This size-10 boot fits well in the foot area but is way to large around the calf (there is about 1&#34; gap all the way around).  So if you have thinner legs but wear a large size shoe, the fit isn't quite right.  The look of the shoe is quite nice though."
3.0,Not worth it. Cute pattern but really thin.
3.0,"The dress was beautiful, but the size runs large."
3.0,I loved this bracelet until it snapped in half and I had to return it.It is feminine and sparkly and I wish I could have kept it.
3.0,"Fits well, but a bit short, can't wear it without leggings underneath"
3.0,"Nice design, but sizing is still way off.  I ordered XL, normally I'm L, but had to give these away because they were too small.  Really liked the design, though, and the mesh materials were great."
3.0,It was small for a large fit more like a medium other than that I love it can't beat it for the price
3.0,Came with the side ripped. Only stitched together by a few stitches very flimsy but easily fixable.
3.0,The title said it all. This product is not designed with Asian people in mind. If you're Asian and you usually wear small or even medium-large. Do not purchase this. Their smallest size may not fit you.
3.0,I like that it has a wide brim. It appears well-made. I don’t like that it’s too big for my head (and I have a normal sized head). It fastens with Velcro at the back and I have it as tight as it will go and it’s still too large.
3.0,"It fit as expected, but the material was on the cheap end. It was for a costume so it really didn't matter to me."
3.0,Got these robes for my mom/mother in law to wear morning of my wedding. The quality looks good but the pink color is really off - it's a light cool toned pink and not blush or warm toned as the color in the photo.
3.0,Not a good as I first thought. Fades a little.
3.0,Very pretty on the front but a little lightweight and the backside is not decorative.
3.0,"Cute oversized glasses, but on the cheaper side in appearance. OK for the pool."
3.0,Color and material are good<br />No hemline. Tons of strings looks bad
3.0,"My granddaughter loved it however, it was too big for her. I had to cut a bigger opening around the eyes and nose. Otherwise a good purchase."
3.0,The socks are really nice but they are a bit tight and I think it is mainly because the pattern is sewn in a particular way that makes them less stretchy than usual.
3.0,Had to repair seam on side of top after 1st wash/dry.  Otherwise very pleased with the set.
3.0,"Wish I cauld say I like them!But used for 2 days and put them in the mail back.they came all different sizes ,was hopeing for a better product but sent back."
3.0,cheap hat.
3.0,Very nice but it broke the day one of use.
3.0,"Product is decent, does not look as premium as it does in pictures"
3.0,They slip off your head during major workouts! Not entirely satisfied. Good for around the house.
3.0,This is a really cute bracelet.  I gave one as a gift and am waiting for mine.  They are a good fit for a 7&#34;wrist. The bell is sweet. nicely done  ...UPDATE.....6 months later....... well I don't think this is chrysocolla ..I had not worn mine and took care of it so I didn't notice till now.  I had seen that the one I had given as a gift was turning white...the bluegreen &#34;paint&#34; color was washing and being worn off...Its probably howlite...if even that...boo... too bad..
3.0,"Works as an underlayer, compression shirt but runs very small.  Normally wear XL, ordered 2XL and fits like second skin."
3.0,"Nice idea, but they are really too thin to be of much use. Product description could have been better. thanks"
3.0,"Descriptions of sizes are off, but was packaged well."
3.0,"These in thought were great, but are far too tight to comfortably wear."
3.0,Like it but only problem it change color quickly
3.0,"The shorts were much smaller than what I usually get when I order that si,e"
3.0,"These fit fairly similar to the photo; however, the waist is extremely small and dug into me. I usually wear a small/medium and bought a medium so they'd be kind of baggy. I ended up returning them because I knew they would be uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time."
3.0,Runs too long
3.0,"These are very cheaply made. Super thin material which is perfect because, i live where it's really hot. The colors are also dark so don't go matching light colors to the pants. I will add photos once they are all hemmed up etc, as of now i ordered a small- i weigh about 100 pounds- 5'2- pants are big and high waisted. :) Delivery was 2 days- arrived early in the day though. hope this helps. stay healthy."
3.0,"Pretty dress, fits well, but cheap fabric and not so well made"
3.0,"Super cute, love the fabric and the pattern, but is snug!<br />I am a XS/S and the small size is really tight."
3.0,"These are great tanks for sure! But to say they are compression tanks is stretching it.. ha! Listening to reviews I ordered a size smaller than usual, but they are still loose! I will definitely still wear them but they are not what I wanted when ordering compression tops!"
3.0,"I like the way this henley fits in the torso. The arms are a bit baggy on me. I initially wanted to return this because the material felt a bit stiff and rough, but I thought I should wash it in case it was just starched for packaging. Nope. It's still rough. I wish I'd returned it."
3.0,The bag was nice looking and strong. Their wasnt much room or storage pockets for what i needed it for.
3.0,"Very cute, would be perfect for my five year old granddaughter."
3.0,I use this product as juice/small drink.  The product feels good in hand and appears sturdy.  Washes up in dishwasher beautifully.  My complaint is the seller.  One glass arrived shattered and I have not had a response from them.  If all had arrived shattered I would have hat a box full of broken glass and no response.  Unreliable seller.
3.0,I ordered two dresses - this one is just made too big and cheap material  I gave it away
3.0,"Brought for my aunt in assisted living, just found out they are to big.. to late to return.<br />Nice produce. But useless to use now  ☹"
3.0,Están muy chiquitos
3.0,"The Onyx plugs were a size smaller than the rest, and the Tiger’s Eye only had one plug. Overall, wouldn’t order again. Tried to find a “Contact the Seller” option to let them know, but found nothing. Other than that - not bad."
3.0,"While these are okay, I feel that there must be something better out there. Not as comfy as I’d hoped. They kind of make my ears stick out more too."
3.0,"The strap seems of good quality and the color is fine as well, my disappointment is for the fact that it didn't come with spring pins. I have a watch collection and I purchase bands on Amazon often and never have I received a band without pins included."
3.0,"These pajamas are... just okay. The fabric is pretty soft, which I really like, and the fit is as expected . However, if you buy pajamas that have black in them, don't expect for the ink to last that long. I could tell after the first wash that it was starting to dim and become gray-ish. There's also a slightly weird smell to them, I'm not sure if others are experiencing the same thing, but it's definitely off-putting. I'm not sure I would recommend these."
3.0,"Great looking but oddly the size 3 was way too small. Also ordered Mini Melissa Girls' Mel Space Love, Black, 3 Regular US Little Kid and those fit perfect. Not sure if these run small or others run large. I did think the velvet bow didn’t fit with the normal matte pvc material."
3.0,"I bought this for my mother. she liked it, she mentioned it was a bit gaudy"
3.0,The hat was too small.
3.0,the bow is really HUGE!!
3.0,"I'm at a in between size so it's hard for me to find the size I want I went off other reviews and they are a little large on me but if I went with large instead of xl they would probably be to small 215lbs. 5'11"""
3.0,The posts were too long. The end with the stone would not stay down on my nose.
3.0,Purchased for hubby. He rates it 3-stars. Says it Hot on his head and it has a weird fit. One thing for sure is that he is a die hard Islanders fan so he will wear it.
3.0,its smaller than it looks but it works ok sofar
3.0,This jersey doesn't cost much because it is made super cheap. I've never felt a jersey so cheap. It fits slightly smaller than the others I own. It'll be good enough to train in.
3.0,Like it but I’m a big girl in the Shoulder
3.0,"They are pretty but the picture made them look green,i was getting them to match my ring.they were way to blue,nothing like the picture"
3.0,"Great fit , doesn’t run small but loses body after initial wash ."
3.0,My daughter loved it...looks antique
3.0,"It is a nice looking mask, but I can see a little hot glue on it and the eye holes are not very big. My eyelashes touch it, and I am not sure how long I will be able to wear it at the party."
3.0,"This is more like 7.5"" and, yes, that can make a difference. Otherwise, it's nice. I had to give it away, tho."
3.0,It's the smallest medium I've ever seen. Seems OK otherwise.
3.0,It's a pretty show and fits great my daughter loves them.  Reason for the 3stars is because the gem things started falling off.
3.0,"They are quite a bit too large actually, but I am wearing them anyway. I thought some of the white lining was breaking away due to manufacturing, but they are still doing it."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3492e2411750dd967282ffadce08441d]] Looks really nice a previous order that was lost came in and was missing a necklace.  Well idk if its the one that was lost or if this was a remake.<br /><br />The thing is the first one a necklace wasn't included<br /><br />So i went and bought a 30 dollar necklace just to match this one.<br /><br />Then this one comes in and the necklace is included but they did something funny to the clip part<br /><br />The second necklace clip that looks normal is the 30 dollat one i bought. Lol if i didn't know better someone got it out for me
3.0,plaid fabric feels cheap and is looser then the jeans them self
3.0,"When ordering, I swore the description said that I was ordering a 3 pack of underwear. What I received today was a single pack of underwear.  You will want to make sure that you screenshot the description when ordering and absolutely make sure that it says ""3 pack"" vs ""1 pack"".<br />  The material is soft, but not the softest that I have had, the band is not scratchy, and the fit and finish is not perfect.  I personally can't tell the difference between the cotton and bamboo . For the price that people are charging for underwear these days you would think that they would be able to somehow jump into the washing machine and wash themselves after a long hard day!<br />  I will give them this, the material is very breathable and they do have a good stretch.  I think that $12 plus tax is too much for what you are getting, I can not recommend these underwear."
3.0,I dont like the neck. Way to big. I would have not purchased it in a store.
3.0,The skirt is cute but only made for an extra small person.
3.0,These socks were just okay. Definitely thought being wool socks they would be warmer but not so much.
3.0,looking better in the photo. Gold area looks pretty fake and you can get the same thing at forever 21 for cheaper.
3.0,item is a dingy white
3.0,Very hot and fits very snug.
3.0,This coat is ok but boxy looking and not tapered at the waist as pictured.  Having mine taken in on the sides so it will be more fitted.
3.0,The image was very blurry.
3.0,"I was really hoping this leotard would be great, but it looks very cheap. The color is great, but the tutu color is off.  I would not say that it’s a good value for the price."
3.0,Very pretty blouse but it's a little snug even though I ordered 2 size up. I'll make it work but wish it fit better.
3.0,Quality was so/so I ended up returning
3.0,Color red is more like a light burgundy.
3.0,"La cartera está hermosa, solo que no espera que el cargador o el tiro corto, al igual que la parte a los lados de los sipers y los bolsillos me saliera amarillo, un amarillo pollito."
3.0,The fit was quite long and would fit someone 5’6” or taller.  I returned the dress.
3.0,Hard to open. But works.
3.0,Large/XL barely fits with a little stretching over my 43.5cm shoes. Working fine so far on 2 rides but worry long term about the zipper breaking to get them around the heel of shoes.
3.0,It ran small. It looked so cute to wear to an outdoor wedding. I guess it was not meant to be. The top was stretchy and not too bad.  The waist  was tight. The material on the bottom felt cheap.
3.0,"The dress is well made with good material. It is longer than I thought it would be. I bought a small and it is a little big on me. Overall the dress is well made, but bigger/longer than pictured and expected."
3.0,They look great but they dont fit very nice.  Wouldn't recommend.
3.0,bottoms are true to size top not so much
3.0,Kind of regret spending the money I did on this.  It's cute but somewhat cheap looking.  It also has a jingle which I had to remove with pliers so everyone didn't hear my every movement.
3.0,"This dress is really nice because you can adjust how tight you can pull it around the neck. So if you have a larger chest it’s easy to work around. In the hips it felt a little weird because the way the dress was done, my hips didn’t match up. But over all very cute and comfortable."
3.0,OK so I’m usually a size medium- bigger on top ( chest) and I got a size large in this dress! Omg it fit on me like a xS - it was so small probably can hit my 9 year old !! Size up!!
3.0,these look fun but quality is poor and I would not use them outside as sun shades
3.0,Returned it - it had no shape.
3.0,"I have a pretty small bottom half compared to the top half of my body, however this was pretty tight over my hips and butt. I ordered this in two prints, same size (L), and both fit the same so it wasn't a sewing issue.<br /><br />I did think this dress was so cute though that I exchanged for an XL and may just have to have the top taken in a little bit."
3.0,Came with a stain & is not nearly as dark gray as pictured.
3.0,"Has the cheap foam soles, not the dense foam soles of real Saucony kicks. Only lasted a couple months before wearing through the white sole."
3.0,Has tags in back that are already peeling off.
3.0,"Honestly, I was a little disappointed in the blouse when I first received it, the material was thin and felt cheap... BUT I received so many compliments when I wore it, that I guess I like it a bit more."
3.0,I like it but the size is too small for me.  I need oversize sunglasses.
3.0,"I ordered a medium to fit my 6.25 inch wrist and it's still very snug. Also, of the two pins that were sent, one was too short and the other was broken. I used my existing pins to get it to fit but it was a little tricky because the notches for the pin lever were cut opposite to my fitbit versa lite."
3.0,Material was thin. Not suitable for cold temps. Daughter wears it though.
3.0,"If you purchase this item you’ll have to air it out before it can be worn. This is a beautiful tutu. However, the smell was horrible! It smelled so bad that my son had to hang it outside for 4-5 days to air it out. The smell of it permeated the entire first floor of their house! After airing it out my daughter-in-law said it was much better and my granddaughter could wear it."
3.0,It was cute but made very big .
3.0,"The suit is waaaay too small.  Should have paid more attention to the reviews.  I like it a little snug, but I couldn't even begin to get it on.  The sizing chart is way off. Should be an Asian sizing chart not American.  The quality and look of the suit didn't look that bad for the 3 minutes it took to realize it didn't fit.  Returned."
3.0,"These would have gotten 5* had not one strap opened while walking, never to be seen again.  I am sure they had been securely closed when I started out."
3.0,The leg part is wide even tho it has a lot of strech if needed the waistline is not stretch material
3.0,Product not as strong as the picture.
3.0,"I thought it is a very cute piece. I ran into issues on the third day that I wore it. It actually started to tarnish. Other than the color fading, it's very beautiful and feels nice."
3.0,"Does not bend or conform to any ear. Unfortunately this did not fit the person it was purchased for. It would be better if it were a pliable metal that could be shaped to fit any customers ear, then the design would be perfect."
3.0,"Pretty mediocre. They shrunk a little after the first wash and now tend to roll up in my shoes, and my size is right in the middle of the range."
3.0,"I ordered this set for the neon yellow color it had in it. It doesn’t have the color at all! Very disappointed! Also, the top is true to size but the bottoms run larger!"
3.0,Got a 2T for my daughter and it fits like a 4T very big and cheap material but it’s cute for the price
3.0,I love this pattern & material. Having a hard time with it fitting around everyone’s neck. Wish it had a wider option of snaps.
3.0,"Well, I ordered this dress for a wedding. However, I will be returning it. It does fit correctly but it reminds me of a grandma nightgown. It's not all flowy like the pic shows, the blue is not nearly so brilliant and it just looks &#34;cheesy&#34;. I am a size 14-16 and the XL did fit nicely."
3.0,Description says 100% but in fact is is only 34% cotton (rest is polyester and spandex).<br />Also has a seam up the back - as well as side seams. Why? I’ve never seen tank tops with back seams - and I feel it when leaning against a chair.<br />Returned.
3.0,"the product is great, some of the buttons come off though and its a pain in the butt"
3.0,I really like this purse. I get a lot of compliments on it and it's plenty big enough. I am a little disappointed in how it's made. The interior green fabric is falling apart and looks cheap from the outside of the purse. I have these little green strings hanging from the zipper.
3.0,"They were packaged very well and came with a cleaning cloth and cloth case, however they were smaller than I expected and the matte finish looked cheapish with a large seam right down the middle of the front of the glasses. If they had been a bit larger I would have probably kept them as a cheap pair to have on hand but not really what I was expecting based on reviews and description."
3.0,Hat is VERY small. The picture does not show size well.
3.0,Son pequeños
3.0,"a bit on the small size, nice color set for most of my outfits"
3.0,"Pros<br />Very sexy and cute outfit idea<br />Good color<br /><br />Cons<br />Fit. Since this is basically supposed to be one size fits all I was expecting it to be stretchy in ALL the pieces. But I'd say only the tights were closest to be one size fits all.<br /><br />The g-string didnt have any elasticity at all, which surprised because even underwear typically has very forgiving and stretchy elastic to allow for different shapes and sizes but this g-string definitely is NOT stretchy. Which also means if your butt and hips are not perfectly prioportioned for this size g-string it will either sag and have extra butt string hanging because you don't have enough to fill it out or the string on your hips will be very tight and unflattering and give you horrible muffin top and then the lace stretched out and doesn't even lay right anymore so it just looks really bad. I would recommend to the manufacturer that they make the g-string more stretchy so it can truly be a one size fits all and and if not at least write down the exact measurements of have to be in order for this to fit appropriately.<br /><br />Moving on to the top. Again this would be super cute and sexy...if it fit right. I managed to get it on but i don't think it was quite big enough and I'm not even what you would consider heavy. I've actually lost a lot of weight and would be considered more slim than anything. I mean I'm not incredibly toned and skinny but definitely not fluffy at all anymore. So anyways, the second I tried to put this on I quickly realized the strings needed to be relaxed and tied because they weren't laced properly and they weren't tied so everything came undone. This led me to my second discovery. The top doesn't have specifically made spots for you to lace the ribbon, you literally have to wedge it through the lace and stretch the crap out of the lace edging which means this will NOT last a long time at all before he lace edging rips. Also because there's no specific spots for the lace to be threaded through it made it hard to figure out where and how to lace the ribbon. The whole process took a very long time (try upwards of 10-15 minutes) and was incredibly frustrating just having to write about it is irritating because it felt like such a waste of time.<br /><br />Once I got it on it was okay but for all the time and trouble I went through it didn't seem worth it to me.<br /><br />Then comes the next part. Putting on the tights and then snapping the top onto the tights. At first I thought the tights weren't big enough but if you have some patience you can stretch them up to fit but then your next problem is the fit of top of each stocking. It (like the g-string) is not stretchy AT ALL and really makes you look super fat unless you are the exact measurements meant for this outfit. Which seems to me probably like size 0-5.<br /><br />As for the snaps they're made of a combo of clear rubber and a flexible plastic/rubber that goes over the top. You push the clear rubber down and it pops out of the plastic loop. This part wasn't too hard. What was hard was trying to get the string of the top to reach down to the stocking while simultaneously holding both in place AND trying to get the snap to snap on. I did it though! Once I finished it didn't look too bad. But I didn't feel super sexy in it generally speaking because the overall fit was very bad. I did however manage to make the most of the situation and got some really good pictures out of it but considering the amount of time and hassle it took to get the dang thing on and the poor fit I would NOT recommend this product and it definitely would not work if you're trying to quickly &#34;slip into something sexy&#34; there is nothing quick about this and the fit isn't very sexy.<br /><br />If they can fix the fit of this outfit and fix the quality then I'd definitely recommend this and love it but right now as it is I would not recommend this or buy it again.<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />The measurements in the photos I shared are of the crotch of the g-string. One is the straight down length and the other is the diagonal length of the crotch.<br /><br />The close up of the lace is of the g-string to show its a raw edge that will fray and easily tear.<br /><br />I also included a side view of the top so you can see that the lacing goes through the side lace edge and pulls really badly on the top. Even if it did fit perfect or at least better because the ribbon goes through the lace edging it would still ruin the top and as a result makes this poor quality and won't last long at all."
3.0,Cheap quality. Clasp and main gem fell apart on first wearing. Fixed it myself and used super glue on gem.
3.0,It is pretty much you get what you pay for.  It is very thin and on the cheesy side.
3.0,Shorts are ok. but what kills it is that the pockets are made of pure cheap plastic material. can you imagen running and having a plastic bag like material robing your thighs. I really don't want to use it. I leave it for laundry day when I'm desperate.
3.0,I gave this to my niece as a gift. The fit was fine however the zipper kept getting stuck. She didn’t give it back to me but that could have been her being polite. I wanted to return it.
3.0,This isn’t stiff fabric. It’s very smooth. But the floral printed one has print on only one side. The other side is white. That was unexpected. You have to adjust how to tie the scarf to cover the white but can be done.
3.0,"This isn't too bad a bralette. Here's the deal. The material is so thin that it's transparent. That wouldn't even be all that big a deal, except that the little opening for the pad is on top of the bra, instead of on the sides like it is for most bras with removable pads. That's because that little top corner of the bra often shows when you are wearing strappy tops, and when it shows, you can see that there is a little 'pocket.' It's hard to describe, but that's the best I can do. It's also pretty tight and I'm a 34A. There will also be a bit of a pouch under your arms. Overall, the fit and the quality are not good. It's still a  fairly cute little bra, but you need some coverage up front and not many tops are made that way."
3.0,It’s cute! Kinda wish I sized up because the bottoms r just a little tight! It also had a stain on it..
3.0,"this product was just ok. this is an acrylic material which is not the best. the hole for the thumb was just cut open so it was running constantly and little threads were flying around all the time even when i would cut one off. it was nice for that extra layer of warmth around wrists, but i really wish that it was made out of a better material. I guess for the price it is what it is."
3.0,Pretty but not quite what I expected. No sparkle. Color is a bit different but seller did list that could happen. I’ll keep them but not worth the cost.
3.0,Very pretty. But I had to buy an insole of some sort because it's so tough  on the feet. I do like them though.
3.0,"The fit was as expected but the material was more see-through than expected. I'm a mom of a curious boy, so I wanted something more conservative. If it were just my husband and me at home it would be fine, but I am returning because it is too sheer for my needs."
3.0,This item runs Very Small.
3.0,"The grips are good so you don't slip and fall in the kitchen or bathroom, or if you have hardwood floors. It is nice to get three pairs for one price. Easy to wash, but they do shrink a bit and you have to stretch them back out."
3.0,Color of stones very pale. The stones appear to be all the same color.
3.0,"These shoes are absolutely gorgeous on my feet.  I was really surprised at how nice they looked - Quite elegant.  Problem is that you have to actually walk in them :(<br /><br />The straps are quite still and after less than half an hour I had a cut under the strap on my right foot that still burns three days out.  I'll see what can be done about softening the strap but otherwise will not be able to wear them.  Pity, I wanted to purchase the brown as well."
3.0,"After using this wallet for about 2 weeks the zipper broke. It's cute and all but not sturdy. Starting to rip down the side, too. Not worth the money and shipping."
3.0,"The product arrives & when we opened it, it was broken. It’s a low quality product."
3.0,fits a little tighter than a large should.  5' 11&#34; 185 lbs.  but i do wear it.
3.0,Although it fits good the buttons makes it look cheap
3.0,"Es de regular calidad. Realmente liviana, y luce como de plástico, no es una buena goma cómo da la impresión en la foto."
3.0,"The bag is pretty and the beading is lovely. BUT I ordered the grey because I wanted something to wear with a grey dress. Unfortunately, the color is much more of a greenish tone, so it will not go with grey. It is a nice bag. Shame about the color."
3.0,This is a really pretty piece.  However it must be hand washed and flat dried then it's very wrinkled.  I have no idea how to iron this!  It's one piece!
3.0,Not as good as expected. Tried several similar items but none are very effective.
3.0,"If you can get it under $20, it is fine. However the quality is mediocre and mine came in a poor condition with the buttons smashed into the device and the screen was pushed in and blurry. Even taking it apart to repair was a hassle as the tray housing most of the motors, which should just lift out, was hastily glued in place. Certainly not a collector’s item."
3.0,"Very hard to insert , but they serve the purpose for which I purchased"
3.0,"This ran small. the first time i wore one, it split on the side."
3.0,"These glasses are great for working on the computer - huge benefit.<br />However, they are also very large.<br />The frams look massive on my face & sit very high on the bridge of my nose.<br />They look great sitting on my desk but not so much on my face.<br />Crazy comfortable though.<br />Comfortable, very helpful but not attractive."
3.0,When they arrived they were not packaged in anything to prevent breaking. They were bent out of shape and one aspect I blame myself on is the fact that I did not read the specs and they were ginormous. They are way too wide for my head and do not even touch my ears let alone stay put on my face at all. But over all they look decent. I think I’d love them is they were downsized a bit. I like large glasses but my head isn’t gigantic.
3.0,"I really like this charm, It fits my bracelet. But the stones are tiny, a lot smaller than I thought. But the color and sparkle is there."
3.0,Pretty but very small fit
3.0,"PROS:The pendant is a decent weight and fairly well constructed. Even after exposure to water it's not turning color.<br />CONS:The chain is too short, weak, and tends to bunch up. It catches up in my hair. The catch is difficult to manage.<br />OVERALL :  A nice piece of jewelry that needs a completely different chain to be acceptable."
3.0,"These are nice, wish they were in gold!"
3.0,The sizing is not correct for American standards and way to big. Size down by at least a size or two. It was large at the waist and even in length. A size 8-9 is more like a 11-12
3.0,"Although the outfit itself is absolutely adorable, the white onesie is super huge, and came with what looks like a pen stain on the side of it."
3.0,not heavy enough to support a full umbrella in wind  Blows over
3.0,"They are very comfortable and stays cool. They only thing is that waist rolls down and they get twisted from time to time. I wear them everyday to work. I'm in the food service business and I do a lot of walk and bending as well as lifting. After a few hours of work they tend to shift to adjust to your body movement, but this makes it uncomfortable. If I'm moderately active they are great, but when I'm very active they become uncomfortable after a period of time."
3.0,"I really like the style, but the fabric is not wrinkle-free and ironing does not get the wrinkles out. I purchased a white one in the same style. It is a different fabric and is easy to keep wrinkle free."
3.0,The texture inside the boots may not suit all! My daughter found it a bit uncomfortable from inside.
3.0,"Cute, but as others have said more like a glorified stuffed animal. My glasses only fit partially. My pug is really fat, lol<br />Hes super stuffed and looks a little special."
3.0,"I don't wear this everyday as I switch out my bands quite often. So, occasional wear and one tears in 6 months. Overall they are comfortable and work well, just not long lasting."
3.0,"Bought this because our 13 year old granddaughter is crazy for One Direction boy band. It looks a little nicer on the website than the product actually is. Having received it, I decided to keep it because I think the granddaughter will like it because it pictures each band member, but feel the price asked was too much. It's little plastic squares and thin stretchy cording."
3.0,"Everything was great in these glasses until I felt that there was no spring in the hinges to fit my head that is bigger than most. Aside from that, They look great and block out blue light. It even comes with a mini blue light to test them out."
3.0,Love the idea of this look but the pockets were awkward and made the sides poke out a bit.
3.0,"It is very difficult to get the creases out of this hat once you receive it. I have never gotten mine to look like the picture. But I am not one that cares so much about the look, I bought it because I am very fair skinned and didn't want to get burnt. For that, it works. Kept the sun off my face and neck. However, if the wind blew I had to make sure I held onto it because it didn't fit my head. There is an elastic band but it was uncomfortable to wear."
3.0,Large and cheap looking
3.0,"I saw the reviews saying to order half a size down. I'm usually a 9 1/2 and ordered a 9 and they're still big. Luckily, an insole or a couple of sticky heel grips will fix the issue but i would recommend getting an entire size down. Very cute shoes though!"
3.0,A little to stiff hard to open and close. Love the color
3.0,"The bust was larger compared to the rest of the slip.  It just fit weird and I am a D cup, and it still was too large in the bust."
3.0,"A little small, but manageable. Be weary if you're a bit meaty in the sides! It looks prettier in person"
3.0,"These seem super durable and great, but they were a lot bigger than we were expecting. We measure our sons current sunglasses which are bordering on too small, and these were listed as just a tiny bit bigger than his current ones, so we figured it would be perfect. They seemed like sunglasses for a small adult, not a small child. They fit me better than they fit my son."
3.0,"I have had these glasses about 10 months and I rotate wearing them with 5 or 6 other glasses, so they don't get a lot of wear and the wear they do get is not abusive.  The right stem broke just outside the hinge as I was placing them on my face. I mended it with glue and tape.  The fix was ok.  Four days later, the left stem broke in the same place.  I don't feel as though that should have happened, especially since they are advertised as ""unbreakable"".  I am going to contact the company.  I doubt I can get a replacement, but, again, it should not happen.  If I am fortunate, I'll update this rating.  TWO DAYS LATER...  WOW!  I'm impressed.  Two days later, I get a full refund.  I rate the company 5 stars for their action, but I still cannot rate the product more than 2 stars.  So I gave the overall 3 stars."
3.0,"Unlike other chainmaille that is stainless and slides well on itself, this not being stainless does not move well. Yes it can stretch, but really does not when putting on and getting off.  It probably does fit an adult, but due to lack of movement I was too afraid to put it on with fear of not being able to get it off."
3.0,I was disappointed that the hat was shipped to me folded into quarters and stuffed in an envelope.<br /> It was slightly misshapen and I did not have the time to return it before the Derby.<br />The design was pretty and appropriate for the occasion.
3.0,Very pretty but was too small and no give in the material
3.0,I've been using no tie bands for years. I did not like this brand because they are not made as one piece but instead have a raised button like center that can be removed leaving a hole. They get caught on the center tongue strap and some of them have lost their button so they look junkie
3.0,"Tried this on and found the sizing to be off.  The top was a bit loose and the skirt was waaaaay too tight (size small).  I'm sending it back and will try the medium size in another color since the one I wanted isn't available.  Strange that their size chart says a medium is a USA size 10.  I'm petite and usually wear a size 4, which is always loose on me.  If the medium fits better, it'll be the first time I'll be wearing a size 10!"
3.0,"After checking both the amazon sizing suggestions and different suggestions at Shimano, one toe of one she was real close to too tight. I had waited soooo long for delivery I was dying to give them a ride to see if they would stretch. I wore thin socks did a few after work rides and the are too tight as in narrow for my feet."
3.0,My wife loves this robe but the string to tie it closed tore off fast
3.0,"Slick fabric, is the kind that snags easily."
3.0,Runs really big! Order a size smaller.
3.0,I ordered it two sizes up from what I normally would and it’s still a bit tight in the waist
3.0,"I got a large and it was way to tight.  I wear a medium in shirts and a 10 in pants.  I'm not a big person.<br />I gave it to my young niece.<br />Because it is a very nice looking coat.  That's why I gave it a 3,"
3.0,Cute but they were bent when they arrived
3.0,Too big for my head!!
3.0,"it looks like a pressure sock but it is not, it feels like a normal sock, it is not good and for the price it is not a good purchase"
3.0,"The dress that was sent to me is NOT 3/4 length sleeves. I was a little upset about it. The dress fits as expected. It's slinky fabric, clings to everything."
3.0,"Super cute but too big for my tiny toes, might used them as regular rings or return them."
3.0,"I bought this because I was having trouble with silicone bands giving me a rash.  I wanted a more breathable fabric, which this bad definitely has.  The trouble is that whenever I adjust it to fit my (admittedly large) wrist, the adjustment slips and loosens within a few minutes.  It's like the buckle doesn't have enough friction to hold it in place.  This is a problem because as it loosens, the watch slips around to the side of my wrist.<br /><br />This would be 5 stars if that buckle would hold better."
3.0,"The product is good, but I had to return them. It was obvious as soon as I opened the package that they were much too small. Order the next size up to be safe."
3.0,"I like the colors and stretchiness but by the time I was able to get the bed small enough so it didn't flop around my wrist, the band was very bulky.  didn't't work for me, I returned it."
3.0,Nice and baggy but really really hot sweater like material. Not suitable for beach in summer
3.0,Great color but thin material.
3.0,The material was way too stiff and made it awkward to walk. Shoes were about a full size too big for me
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3a64a3ec35a12607fe12b276bb5f4d52]] It won’t stay tight on ur arm and it started coming lose
3.0,"As with other reviews, this dress fits a little boxy, wider and shorter than the photo indicates. I'm using it in the last few months of pregnancy, so it works but won't be flattering after I deliver. Good thing it's cheap."
3.0,Nice piece but a bit heavy fo what I was looking for.. I liked the design so I used it to hang next to my husbands shadow box and bought a lighter engraved piece that is simple and light
3.0,This dress was cute but way to short. If it was actually the length I expected I would have kept it. But it fit perfectly everywhere except the length. It's too bad the size chart/measurements aren't actually what they say they are. Sad!
3.0,Its not exactly what I thought it was going to be.  The colors weren't as vibrant as I had hoped for and the letters and accents were printed on embroidered.  I should have looked closer at the description.  Other than that it fine.
3.0,Small and the logo is not centered.
3.0,I wouldn't suggest these if you use a reusable cloth mask. The sides don't hold on to the mask to keep it in place
3.0,Kind of cheap but is ok for gift.
3.0,Color was not as pictured some of the bracelets where not stable on strings.
3.0,"I clicked the combo that comes with the stickers, and it said small children's hoodie, but the hoodie came like it was a small for a child much older than 6"
3.0,The posts are too wide for the holes in my ears.
3.0,Make sure you get a size up
3.0,"The color is a lot lighter then pictured. I was expecting a more brown but its more on the tan, cream side."
3.0,"Hat is super cute, however it was squished into a ball for shipping. once unfolded you can see all the creases it left in the hat. I'm hoping they will work them selves out before our pictures!"
3.0,"I’m 5ft 7 and 135 pounds. I ordered size small. The leggings didn’t look like they would fit me at first but they did, though they are quite snug. I’m not sure if this was the intended fit but they are very body hugging, I wouldn’t exactly say they are flattering since they compress me quite a bit but that’s my only issue."
3.0,This dress required a lot of maintenance through during the 2 hours she had the dress on. It’s pretty but more of a sitting in place kind of dress
3.0,really pretty but smaller then I expected
3.0,More form fitting than I thought. This dress is also transparent despite the built-in slip!!
3.0,"The item is OK, but it doesn't look the same as it does in the ad.  The quality is cheap and I am sure it will shrink the first time we wash it.  It's a xmas gift so I am keeping it for now, but would not order again."
3.0,The length of the skirt is NOT as in picture at all couldn't  not be bother to return it I will wear whenever
3.0,"I ordered the purple. The color is not at all like the fibrant deep purple as shown. It is more a muted dull purple, like a washed out version of the pic.<br />It is very soft to touch."
3.0,Not as big as I thought it would be but love the style of it.
3.0,"Sizing is confusing. I'm a US medium. I thought these were Asian sizes and  XXL (only size left) was a US Large, which is usually ok. Wrong. When they arrived, I easily put them on over my jeans with room to spare.  It wasn't even a good look according to my wife."
3.0,"These are OK, but if you're at all athletic the tops are really tight on the calves. I'm a long distance cyclist, and the tops dig into my calves... though I wore a pair on the bike one of the cooler days at the start of the year, and even got compliments from other cyclists!"
3.0,Very cute but WAY too small. I ordered a size up and still didn’t fit.
3.0,"It’s cool enough, but arrived kinda folded and is really painful to wear."
3.0,"Although pretty, fell apart when taking it out of the bag."
3.0,"The pattern was cute-bought as a stocking stuffer for a son. He’s not a huge guy, Shoe size of 9 in men’s,  but the socks were really tight, almost like for a child. He wore them once but they aren’t comfortable to wear regularly. Too bad"
3.0,"This anklet has a neat and sleek design.  It is pretty heavy.  However the clasp stinks; it is a wire that you have to bend to close.  Since the edge of the clasp does not insert into anything, it snags and hooks onto clothing."
3.0,My wristlet handle broke and this was a great replacement. I just wish the opening was smaller to fit closer to my wrist.
3.0,This was a cute outfit and the material was good only con is the sizing is off. I ordered a large but the the large is more like a small
3.0,quality medium-range. good for the price. would buy again.
3.0,Way too large..will have to  have it taken in a bit( dont want hassle with returing it.).It is very lightweight and thin material...not sure I would order it again- even if it fit smaller...
3.0,"Typically a size 4 and ordered a M (size 2-4).  Product is a bit snug and I would have purchased a size up had I known that it runs a bit small.  Item is tight in the legs and elastic hip area. If you're typically a 4, purchase a Large."
3.0,The strap length is unsatisfactory.  Probably a good watch for a teenager.  Casio makes good watches for a good price.  I saw the exact same watch at Wal Mart for double the price.  The only drawback is the size of the strap.
3.0,"These pants were definitely comfortable and fit as expected. However, they were see-through... Super disappointed by how thin they are."
3.0,"They are ok, not great quality."
3.0,"Didn't like the thin material, and no pockets. Will be more for just lounging at home. Cute print though. Fit as expected."
3.0,"The quality seems fine - though not as nice as cotton - however If you are size 8 -8.5, definitely go with the larger one. They seem hopeless to stretch, and pull my toes uncomfortably tight. Bummer."
3.0,The dress is really adorable but it is a wrap dress…usually with a wrap dress there is a slot to pull the string through to tie the dress. Unfortunately they seem to have left this feature out of the dress so you either have to tie it like a bathrobe and flash everyone or make your own slot for the string. I think I will choose that latter….
3.0,Quality only acceptable.
3.0,It has a good fit for a bit snug. It also looks good.
3.0,looks exactly like picture but sun broke off after a few days
3.0,"I bought the black touchscreen gloves. These gloves don't look anything like the pictures - see the unedited, real-life photos that I've uploaded. The gloves also did not fit correctly. I bought 2 sizes: 8.5 and 9 and both were loose on the hand - I am normally a medium and unfortunately, neither worked. In addition, there was extra material on the finger tips, making for a baggy fit. The gloves are also very thin and I doubt they'll be good for the NYC winters. The fit and finish is not worth $30 in my opinion. You can find similar quality gloves at any department store near you."
3.0,It’s ok quality I guess. It just feels sort of thin but if that doesn’t bother you then it’s definitely worth it!
3.0,They fit a little more snug around the hips then i expected. The compression shorts are longer then the regular shorts. They tend to ride up but with the compression shorts its not too noticible. May be better if i got a size larger.<br />For the price theyre great and will probably order again.
3.0,"These are actually a bit short in the piece that goes behind the ears.  They end up sliding the glasses back up against my eyes and my eyelashes brush them as I blink.  I don't think I have large head, but just a smidge more in length would have been perfect."
3.0,"Beautiful mask. But way to big even when adjusting.  When I got it right, it was hard to breathe through."
3.0,Haven't used yet as warm snap ruined skiing last winter. A little small for an adult. Not sure on fogging.
3.0,Nice fabric and cute design but the waist is very small.  I am a size 10-12 and I bought a large and it fits but the waist is tight and bunches up ...not uncomfortable to wear but I would have to cover up the waistband with a shirt or it would look unflattering.  Will probably give it to my daughter.  Order up a size
3.0,The bottom was perfect and I love it but the top fit in the stomach but was huge in the chest area.
3.0,"It's a nice hat, but being shipped flat it bent  on the brim and crown, and the bends do not come out. I bought it for everyday,&#34;waiting for bus hat&#34; so it will do"
3.0,Snap kept coming off
3.0,"Liked the graphics on the teas. Made some nice materials, But it was not true to size very small"
3.0,"Handy bag, does its job and very light. I wish it was much bigger though."
3.0,"after washing twice, the dress is starting to look old and has a lot of lint. also, the buttons are not good quality"
3.0,"Not for outside, they get wet and the soles are rather thin."
3.0,"I bought this Aurora watch with a brown band and white face with silver trim -- beautiful.  The band is flexible/soft, and the case is thin -- just they way I like it.  So I bought this one -- black band with black face and gold trim a couple weeks later.  The case is thicker and the band is stiff!  Had I gotten this one first, I never would have bought a second one.  Still, the price is right."
3.0,"To the best of my efforts I could only get one of the cuff links to work. They look snazzy, but considering there are functional products available I would not recommend for anything more than the looks."
3.0,Very cheap shirt. Material and look of shirt is not what was expected.
3.0,I wish I got an x small I would have probably of bought more but the small has bunching in the crouch area and I dont know if the xsmall would be to small so I'm having a hard time sending this back for a return for a xsmall cause I think they will be to small.... ugh I really really wanted to likeb these I've seen so many positive reviews also I keep putting 3 stars and they keep changing it to 4....
3.0,It’s reallyyyy thin but is a cute top
3.0,Shrunk too much
3.0,"Not extremely high quality, but what can you expect at this price point? Some of the green was chipped, but other than that, the glasses look good. They were a little big on my face, so I gave them to my 16-year-old son, and he loves them."
3.0,Skirt was long for me ...
3.0,It's okay - really just another canvas bag
3.0,The fit was great. I’m 5’4 and 155lb so the Large fit great. The color is not as dusty rose as it appears. It’s more of a bright pink.
3.0,Super cute and I get tons of compliments on it but the straps wear out and fall off in just a couple of months.
3.0,Cheap not like compression material. Not what I expected
3.0,But....i wanted it to be a regular bracelet...not a necklace\bracelet...just a regular bracelet.... no wrapping it around a few times...nothing just a bracelet. But it is pretty
3.0,"This is an adorable, stretchy, and comfortable band.  I really enjoy wearing it, but 4 days in the band came apart from the metal piece that connects to the Fitbit.  I was able to get the metal rod back into the hole it goes into, so it still works, but if any pressure it put on that side (such as putting my hand in my pocket and it rubs on the jeans fabric) it comes out again."
3.0,Pretty decent quality is kinda thin it seems
3.0,"Arrived quicker than expected. I wear women's shoe size 9.5 and these fit, but I wouldn't think they could stretch too much further. There are very thin which is what I wanted but they aren't opaque and a couple of pairs have holes after being washed once. They won't last long."
3.0,Looks pretty but I’m not sure how it will hold up a little disappointed more money less quality
3.0,Looks nice but I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it was still too small.
3.0,These area cheaply made but they are really cute!
3.0,The quality and the fit is good.
3.0,I ordered a 38 as I have a 35-36” waist. I received a size 36/38 and when I tried on the belt I couldn’t even buckle it with the last hole. Order 2 sizes up if you order this product.
3.0,"It's a very thin gauge, but nice."
3.0,"I really like the tooth and the bead was a nice touch, but expected the tooth to be a tad bigger. Other then that I love it!"
3.0,Cute temporarily but the gems fall out.
3.0,La parte de atrás muy transparente
3.0,I like it. Just wish  they had this in 16inch..<br /><br />Update : This thing is changing colors already . I wouldn't buy again that's for sure. Was great for a while
3.0,Bought these cos they say pink but are not even close to pink.  Still cool glasses though
3.0,"nice shirt, but impossible to take advantage of clips and clip closed without the assistance of another person."
3.0,"Never tried it out, didn't like the look of the belt. I think some might like it, but for this particular outfit i purchased it for..... i didn't like it."
3.0,Fake fir sheds and gets in your eyes.
3.0,"Not as long or wide as I had expected. Shiny stretchy fabric, not like the cotton-y floral ones I have. Fine for pajamas though"
3.0,It's okay. I expected it to be bigger. It also smells kinda funky lol
3.0,These zippered compression socks do work. They also keep my feet and legs warm but maybe too warm while on a plane. I wish they came in a size about 2 inches shorter though.
3.0,A bit thicker and wider than I was hoping.<br />I totally feel like Axl Rose whenever I put the red one on...so I never wear it.
3.0,loved the product but had to return for a larger size. read all the previous reviews and sized up as most people say this item runs small. It sure does. Had to return and order 2 sizes up. Hoping my next order will fit. If not then I will return and forget it.
3.0,Smaller than expected.  Packaged flat so large crease along bottom
3.0,"Good fit, but they makes me itchy even I washed them"
3.0,I really don’t think these did anything as there was no difference between with glasses and not (color wise). Then after a few weeks the glasses broke and they only stayed at work on my desk.
3.0,not a fan of the material but they work just welll for yoga pants to work out annd wear. i wish it hugged your hips just a little more
3.0,Too small for xl I give it away
3.0,Like the shirt. Ordered 2x fits like large.
3.0,This product does not replace the original inserts that came with the Rolfe wallet. I can live with it but I would have preferred the option to purchase an exact replacement of the precisely same dimensions.
3.0,"I think this will be really nice and warm and its lightweight. Now the negatives, the hood on mine comes to a point like a nome hat. The front is VERY short while the back is nice and long. If your thinking of keeping anything below the top of your hips warm, forget it. I'm 5'7"" for referance. Its too much of a hassle to try and wrestle it back into its little bag to send back."
3.0,"Doesn't have any give in the fabric and zipper gets stuck order 2 sizes up didn't fit but, the dress is lovely"
3.0,"I ordered the Medium size. The bottoms were a bit snug but could have worked (and super cute!) The top was way too big. Unwearable without modifications. For comparison I am 5'7&#34;, 135 lbs, and a 32D (VS sizing). I returned it because I didn't want to have to modify the top and I found a different bikini for a similar price that fit, top and bottom."
3.0,Size runs small so unable to wear it at the moment but I really like it!
3.0,Unfortunately one of the earrings is broken
3.0,"ran small, had to return"
3.0,The bag is not pictured corrected. The bag in the picture is shown bigger that the actual bag. This bag is more a purse rather than a tote. The purpose of my purchase was to fit my 15.6 laptop to and from school and this completely failed me. Don't get me wrong this is a cute purse just did not advertise well according to size!
3.0,"Did not like the color when it arrived , expected. More reddish . The picture clearly shines brown or milk chocolate color"
3.0,It is very cute and comfortable but after less than a week of wear the coating is already beginning to peel and metal underneath paint on the turtle is beginning to show. I'm super bummed because this belly ring is by far the cutest one I've seen. Ohh well.
3.0,"Watch was bigger than I expect it, but the quality it's great..!"
3.0,"I would normally wear an xl, which is what I ordered.  However this was way too small and very tight."
3.0,"OK, but not in love"
3.0,The sizes are larger then normal.
3.0,Brought 2
3.0,"Not big like I like them, but ok. Would not buy again."
3.0,"Product fit for my husband is a little tight but he still wears it!<br />Washed many times, product is made well!"
3.0,Pretty but too small for my rest
3.0,"I really like the look of this dress, but it does not fit right. It is too big in the waist, but too small in the arm holes. I cannot wear it yet- I am getting the sleeves let out. Once I do, the dress will be perfect for work."
3.0,The dress is pretty but it wasn't as long as I imagined it to be.  A little disappointed.
3.0,"I bought the first one in coffee color and really liked the way it fit. Then I got a red one, but it's different. The bottom are wider on the sides.<br />Also, the protective sticker left an adhesive residue after removal.<br />Still ok product."
3.0,"It is a pretty dress, but the top was much too tight -- so I had to return it"
3.0,Fits as expected but they should take a photo with a model wearing the actual piece because it's not as ribbed or sewn like the one in the model pic. It is exactly like the one in the other pictures though. Cute.
3.0,I cannot use due to it being more of a size Medium than a size XL
3.0,"I wanted to love these so much!  The fit and feel is great!  I ordered a greyish color (Hk190) in size Medium.  I'm about 135#, 5'9"", and lean.  And unfortunately when I bent over for the see-through test, they failed.  I'm a coach at our gym so I demo a lot of squatting moves and obviously cannot have my butt or undies showing through.  Seller was fair in offering a return or 50% reimbursement."
3.0,"This dress looks nice, but when you sit down and it opens at the fold at the knees you can tell it's not very good quality. If you're looking for an inexpensive dress this would do fine."
3.0,I have to loose some weight for it to fit comfortably.  It is cute.
3.0,"Returning, a 2x would fit me better."
3.0,"I needed this to get my daughter from Texas to here, thats about all it did, but it did it."
3.0,Cute. Soft. Runs 2 sizes small.
3.0,"While I waited for months to receive this, it finally arrived. I loved it! But it broke easily after 2 weeks. I would order another one, but since it broke so easily and took so long to get I'll take the loss. Lesson learned."
3.0,I ordered an XL and it was kinda tight.  Good thing I’m using for a clown outfit so it won’t be worn often.
3.0,"My first comment on this hookah is, you are buying a $50 hookah people, keep that in mind when buying this. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Opening the box I found the hookah packed in the hard case, which is a pretty standard black hard case. Oh, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING in the package is covered in ""Made in P.R.C."" which I'm guessing is the Peoples Republic of China. And it looks like it too.<br /><br />The first gripe that I have with this product is that not all of the things that are in the description, are in the package. The ""brush cleaner"", ""mouthpiece"" and ""built in screen"" or ""pipe screen"" depending on which description you read, are nowhere to be found in the package. Bummer.<br /><br />I put the hookah together and that went smoothly. It was tough to see inside the hookah itself to see where I should keep the water level, but after playing around with it everything worked out pretty well.<br /><br />The hookah produced pretty decent smoke, concidering that the bowl is pretty small. It would probobly be concidered a ""medium"" bowl. I did have to use some tin foil to make a platform for the charcoal, but that worked out pretty well, I only burnt the sheesha a little the first few times I smoked it.<br /><br />Construction is pretty medeocre. Cheap paint job, heck, it diden't even look like the picture, its more of a dark blue color than a ""Midnight Silver"". It is definitly NOT silver. Well, the glass isn't anyways.<br /><br />All in all, I give this hookah an 7 out of 10. One point minus for being cheaply made by Chinese prison laborers, and another 2 point minus for not including everything in the package. Thats the real bummer. But, for $50 bucks, you get what you paid for, a cheap hookah."
3.0,The shorts underneath are very short like underpants... Tiny underpants.  I just wore regular shorts under instead and got the look I wanted.. Otherwise it is a very cute outfit.
3.0,Very light and airy...pretty color.  Subsequently found similar items in Dollar Days outlet for same price
3.0,fits really small
3.0,I am pretty sure this is a womens jacket.
3.0,Good quality material but sizes run extremely small and the tank is very short. I ordered a medium and it looks like an XXS.
3.0,We’re correct size but didn’t fit son
3.0,"I recieved this bracelet as a Christmas gift and was thrilled since I tell the grandkids I love them to the moon and back, HOWEVER I fine the online bead color totally misleading compared to the actual product which is more blue than turquoise/aqua."
3.0,"I really like the design, it's difficult to find digital watches with this kind of design... but is disappointing you can't see the digital time from certain angles (it only shows 88:88).<br />I didn't like the strap either, it's too bulky and cheap."
3.0,looks nice but arrived a day too late so had to return:(
3.0,"Fabric is very soft,<br />does not have filter protection,<br />ear holes are comfortable enough,<br />can be a little bit bunchy with glasses so might be better for non-glasses wearers.<br />Very clingy style fabric, it shows every contour and shape of the face.<br />If you like that style and look, this will work for you.<br />If you would like more room between your face and the mask I would dissuade this style for you.<br />I don’t have a very large head or face so anyone with any bigger Features or head size would seem to feel restrictive as on me it’s already very tight. Definitely would not recommend any warm water or heat drying as I can’t imagine it would do well and I’ve only washed it in cold water and air dried it...<br /><br />Otherwise style is attractive and easy to stick in a bag or pocket for travel or use on the go,<br />I will be using mine over top of a mechanical air blowing plus filtration mask for an added layer of protection and the UV blocking aspect for the skin on my neck and décolletage .<br /><br />Also the styles that cover the neck can get a bit hot so will be looking forward to using it in the cooler fall and winter months now…<br /><br />Overall very close to what I expected but will probably not rely on it for the higher level protection needed for my chronic health condition etc.<br /><br />You could double up and put a filtration mask over but under it will be tough unless it’s a hard plastic style to pull it over...<br /><br />Can’t see it uses for this as well for healing after aesthetic procedures, a Tattoos or immobilize where you don’t want light or visibility to your neck or upper chest for whatever reason. Would stylishly cover any wound healing bandages etc. if need be. After working in plastic and reconstructive surgery I can see this being helpful. Post facelift/laser treatment/chemical peel or skin cancer removal patients etc. might like wearing this to further heal while out after some initial healing and if not fitting too tightly."
3.0,"Love the fit, nice and snug, but material kinda looks like panties up close!"
3.0,"cute but the worst purse is owned, things fall out, not practical"
3.0,These were made cheaply.  Very flimsy but served the purpose somewhat.
3.0,"seize little to small, seize 32 take seize large!"
3.0,"I loved the color.  I ordered the purple and it was gorgeous! The lace sleeves are awesome. The midsection was tight. The fabric was thick with a strong polyester feel.  The pockets were the biggest problem. They stick out causing an odd, unattractive shape on the hips.  I sent it back."
3.0,It fit somewhat tight. But I like the way it looks
3.0,"You might as well throw away the &#34;bike chain&#34; portion of this item, as it is made of a very soft, thin metal bent into links. These links pull apart at the slightest tug.<br />The main chain itself is sturdy, as is the ring and the crosses.<br />I wouldn't buy it again, but I won't say it's horrible.<br />Definitely more for aesthetics than practicality."
3.0,"I order 2 of the same, pay attention this is why there are mixed reviews!! The 1st one was more of a cotton blend,  not see through BUT there was a seam down the middle FRONT of the skirt. So i decided to order another incase it was a mistake. The one i got today IS SEE THROUGH thin more slinkey! So... there you have it! I ordered the tank top blue flower pattern."
3.0,fits true to size. fabric feels a little rough and cheap.
3.0,It's just average. It is nothing I would wear.
3.0,They look great; however they are a little thinner and flimsier than the store bought type at Costco and there was no case for protection. A bit disappointing.
3.0,The color does not match the Gear S3 Frontier.
3.0,Not a good organixer
3.0,"The fabric is soft and comfortable and they are well made. I knocked a star off because the waist is way too big for my slender girl and since they stitched the elastic into the seam all the way around I can not easily adjust them to fit her. The length fits her as expected, but they did shrink in length after several washes. I wouldn't recommend for really slender and tall girls, but otherwise they are nice pajamas."
3.0,Very good deal and material. Thought they’d be a lil bigger but still worked with lip balm.
3.0,"This shirt is cute.  Unfortunately, if you have broad-ish shoulders it will be snug if you order your typical size.  Due to shoulder snugness it also is uncomfortably tight/rubs in the underarm area."
3.0,Jeans didn’t fit me right. They are a slightly higher waistline than I’m used to and the fit around the hips was too large for my body. I carry my weight in my belly and have slim hips. The jeans are cute though.
3.0,The picture is chipping away. It was pretty.
3.0,These watch were very hard to set the time on. But great gift for bday party bags
3.0,The were a couple of small dints/scratches one of the two pearls.
3.0,I wear 8 1/2 women's and the S/M were too big.  They help some  but less compression than I expected - I think as too big so looser fit.  I have a pair of higher tighter compression socks that help a lot more for pain relief from torn knee and feet/ankle soreness related to the injury but I wanted to try a lower height sock like these.  Comfortable and light and I think would be great if fit better.
3.0,I really wanted to love this blouse. It's just Meh...on. Can't even give it away to friends.
3.0,not much support.  (but very cute if you are a C cup or smaller)
3.0,Size was off but great ring
3.0,"Fits well, very cute.  Have worn & washed it a few times & can see it's starting to pill already :("
3.0,I sent them back on 02/ 20/2017
3.0,"Good replacement to match the original sticks. However, the original sticks and these tend to wear down really fast. I would not buy if you use your controller extensively unless you really like the default sticks."
3.0,"very pretty pattern, not a great material and smaller than expected."
3.0,The headband was too long for my son's head.  I had to alter it to make it fit.
3.0,Expected a little more thickness... For the price is ok... Nice colors. Better for teens or girls .
3.0,"I am 5'1"" and 140 pounds. I bought a large and it fits more like a small medium."
3.0,The keychain in itself is cute however the fingers came in a bit weird..
3.0,Way too dark and not at all like the picture. I have had mine sitting in the hot Florida sun next to the pool for the last 5 days hoping to fade it out some. Maybe they are all different but mine is very dark and not at all like the pic.
3.0,Won’t stay put. Tie isn’t secure enough. Needs Velcro or my secure strap.
3.0,"I love the socks. They are very cute, fit well on my 8.5 US feet, and generally make wearing ballet flats much nicer. However, I did not receive the wash bag that was supposed to come with it, and they're just a tad short in the heel for me. Would buy again, but still a bit disappointed I didn't get the wash bag.<br /><br />I have not contacted the seller about the lack of wash bag, so no feedback from me on their customer service. Everything arrived on time, and generally what I expected (minus that bag)."
3.0,"I want to give this a 4 or 5 star review but it took over a month to get here. Did NOT arrive when I was told it would. It was delayed over a week past due date. (really screwed up Christmas)<br />But, the pin is of good quality. It is made well."
3.0,Material heavier than thought!
3.0,"I bought this for my teenage son. Removing pieces from the band was a pain in the butt and the tool that was included bent. Thankfully, I had a spare tool from a different watch that was up to the job. Both tools tended to scratch the surface because the indent is minuscule but the pressure need is high to remove the pins. The tool tends to pop out of the indent.<br />I finally used a method with the non-bendable pin tool where I braced it against the table and forced the watch down over it. It was hellish and I’m not looking forward to adding band parts back in as my son grows."
3.0,It looks good and is as advertised.  My problem with it is that the lining gets caught in the zipper and gets stuck.  I've managed to get it unstuck but it was not easy.  I may still return it.
3.0,"I love the wallet, but am disappointed in the inside quality.  The coin zipper broke the first 2 days.  The outside zipper sticks, so I am concerned it will break also.  I love the RFID in it."
3.0,I loved the pants but ordered size bigger and still too small
3.0,"These are definitely a lounge type of legging. Very soft and stretchy,  but even a small is too big especially in the waist."
3.0,I have yet to use but i'm excited.
3.0,This is a review for the Dokotoo Womens Plus Size Overlay Hammock Cut out Swing Arm Blouse Tops in black.  The material of this top is very thin and see through.  It is very light weight.  It looks better on the model online then it does in person.  It is an okay blouse but not my favorite by far.  It is just an okay purchase.  It feels and looks on the cheaper side.  It is long so it would work well with leggings.  I received this top as a promotional test product at a discounted testing price to use and review.  This is my honest and unbiased opinion after receiving and wearing this top.
3.0,I don’t get who makes dresses with no layering under. It’s well made and pretty material but so light and see through!
3.0,"One pair for really good- the one with EKG pattern on it. The other one- with multi-colored hearts was leaving imprints on my legs, and it was visibly smaller than the other one I mentioned. Didn't try the third one yet."
3.0,"Sleeves are short, I’m 5’6 128 lbs"
3.0,Pretty.  Haven't worn yet
3.0,Beautiful dress!! Way too short 😞
3.0,Too narrow but fit.
3.0,Nice purse. It did however start to tear when you add the straps to it and carry around your neck
3.0,"This was cute and I so wanted to love it, but....I have too many rolls to make this work. The color is just as it shows, I was worried the straps would be wonky, but they fit perfectly due to the stretch material.  The material that hugs your bust line so nicely also hugs your fat rolls, not nice! Not worth trying to return so I gave it to my daughter, who has no rolls and it looks super cute on her.  Not sure how long it will  hold up, looks kinda worn after one wash and lots of  loose strings. It did ship quickly. For reference I'm a 36DD, 5'3, 165lbs, and ordered an XL."
3.0,This sweater is surprisingly heavy and thick and pretty much stiff. I expected it to be much softer and really wanted to like it but was disappointed by the quality. Returned.
3.0,Does not look like the picture at all.
3.0,"I want to like Carhartt's line for ladies but I think they and I have different ideas about what works on a body.  I like the roominess of the leg, but I really don't care for the high-ish rise of the waist- they sit high on my belly and crush it when I bend over.  Maybe I'm just sensitive but ouch!  I don't want mom jeans, I need belly freedom!<br /><br />I'm slim, so I seem to fall somewhere between too tight and too loose with Carhartt sizes.  I bought their twill cargo pants, which come in a lower rise that I like, but they're thinner fabric and tore within 4 days on some briars.  I wish they could meld the style of the twill pants with the awesome durability of the double front carpenter pant- I would be in heaven! But to me they're too expensive to be uncomfortable in, so I'll stick with the twills for now"
3.0,Not the most well designed jacket. Very flemsy
3.0,Bought an orange umbrella thinking there were two tones as the picture seems to represent.. There is not. It's one solid orange color.
3.0,"this is an ok necklace,it isn't fine jewelrly so you have to take that into account. I am not 100% happy but if I wear it just showing under  a collar it will be ok."
3.0,"Well, that about says it all.  My husband has a big (huge!) head, and it's difficult to find hats for a reasonable price that fit (did you know there are websites that sell &#34;big head&#34; hats?  but they're pricey).  This fit well, but it looks big--it sits high on top, and the bill is pretty long.  It's just kind of goofy looking.  He'll wear it around outside at home; the mesh will be cooler, but no way will he wear it in public.  But I also bought the [[ASIN:B009Q19ELU Outdoor Research Command Cap]], and it looks so much better than this.  Of course, it's also more expensive."
3.0,Should have listened. They are so cute but so big.
3.0,"Fit and fabric are as described, but waistband is very large and thick. Too uncomfortable, returned."
3.0,"I was pleased with the quality of the charm. However, the clasp was bigger than I anticipated, and not removable, so I couldn't use it for a charm holder."
3.0,Not the greatest. It's an iron on decal and not even centered. There's extra material tucked in on top of the bill.
3.0,"Purchasing for myself, very cute shoe, however, the sizing is way off. Tried to give them to my daughter and she could not fit them either. Purchase at least one to 2 sizes up."
3.0,I ordered this shoe in Feb. 2019. They have been working well for me but now the locking mechanism in them for when you tighten them is no longer working.
3.0,Just okay.  Not cotton
3.0,"Nice looks good. Protects the face from small rocks and bugs. Downside is when the wind hits it it smashes into your nose and mouth. Have to put additional padding, also rubber zigzags for the alas tic snapped early on."
3.0,"Very stiff, needs fabric softener"
3.0,"Keep you warm, I use this primarily when snow plowing."
3.0,The bottoms fit perfectly and were great to wear! I wear a 36D and the top was WAY too small. Luckily I was only looking for a bottom when I ordered this so I was happy with it overall.
3.0,nice stones but they are placed too close together and pulled the hair from my wrist. had to return it.
3.0,"Looks good and works, just very thin with flimsy draw strings."
3.0,This is a very nice dress and it fit good below the waist but the upper back was huge and sadly I had to return it.
3.0,Did not have the grid lines as pronounced in display picture.
3.0,"I ordered a 1x and it didnt fir as snug as I wouldve wanted them to. I'm a size 12. When I received them they said they were a size Small. I almost fell out, but something about seasonal shipping? Idk..."
3.0,Release mechanism a bit hard to use.
3.0,I loved the top but the bottoms are to big. They feel like they would slide down and give you the long crotch vibe.
3.0,Some of them don’t unscrew and I can only use a handful of them
3.0,"This may be an example of you get what you pay for.  These are fairly inexpensive but they did not hold up well with my son.  Granted, my kids are hard on their shoes but he wore a hole through the sole of the shoe within a few months of wear.  I would not buy again."
3.0,Very Average and the image is not that clear.
3.0,"was in pieces, had to repair"
3.0,"Loves the color and the lights.  I live within a subdivision so wind is not huge.  A wind came thru and snapped umbrella pole apart right at the silver area where the pole tilts.  No sure how to get about getting a new one from the seller. Disappointed in the durability of pole, as I really do like the color and the lights."
3.0,Gave the. To my 12 yr. old grandson.
3.0,Straps are smaller than expected. They are better for wallets.
3.0,Cute jeans. Fit well. But the belt loop  ripped the first time I tried them on
3.0,Perfect for narrow feel. Look durable.
3.0,im 5'2&#34; and 140 pounds. i got the small. it fit a little smaller than expected but its still wearable for events and such. the material isnt stretchy or breathable though.
3.0,"Nice style; material too thin. Would have returned,  but did not want to be bothered."
3.0,"Material was that shiny stuff they use for athletic, rip away pants. Otherwise cool but not what I wanted. Returned them."
3.0,Huge! Beautiful color but not really my style.
3.0,"Very cute shoe, which my daughter loves.  However, the Velcro closures detach easily - after only 1-day of wearing.  I've had to superglue them back in place, at least twice since purchasing a few weeks ago.  That is disappointing.  I'll see how long I can make them last, but I won't be purchasing this brand again."
3.0,"Best I've found, just can't find the best bifocal sunglasses.  Most of them start to strip away at the coating right away.  These have not done that yet."
3.0,I’m using this skirt for a costume so I wasn’t too concerned about the fit but it is a little big. I ordered a medium and I’m 5’7 145lbs. It was longer than I expected. It goes to about mid thigh on me. Overall it’s cute for a costume I can make it work the material is feels like jeans!
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress. The one I received must have been a return because it was inside out and folded silly in the bag.<br /><br />When I first put it on I was really excited. The curvature is super flattering on your chest at the top. However, the split at the bottom starts way too high. I’m not trying to have anyone see anything they aren’t supposed to see… if you know what I mean.<br /><br />I ordered the extra small. I’m 5’4, 120 lbs, slightly long torso. It fit my body perfectly everywhere except where the split starts. Sizing up would be too big on me.<br /><br />So if you’re shorter than I am or have a short torso this may work for you."
3.0,I like the product but it is a little small.  I'm hoping to get my body to match!  HaHa.
3.0,I bought this keychain to replace a similar Kate Spade one that was gifted to me 3 years ago. This keychain is really cute and fun but ripped after only 2 months. Not sure if it is counterfeit or just poor quality.
3.0,You get what you pay for... They are cute but very thin... Also they fit good in the waist but my thighs were bursting out
3.0,"I returned them, because they were too short."
3.0,Expected them to be little bigger. And the delivery also was delayed. Other than these the product look is good
3.0,"I was excited to receive this but sadly the M looks more like an L. I am 5’5 130lbs and normally wear an M but this looked way too big, it wasn’t even the baggy look but the arm and shoulder areas just didn’t sit right and it looked all wrong. Will be returning. Make sure you go a size down when ordering. Other than that it arrived quick and in good condition, I may order again."
3.0,The purse is a good quality leather but the handle was stiff and narrow. I ended up returning it.
3.0,"The dress arrived on time and looks exactly like in the picture (I ordered the Navy Blue floral dress). I tried it on and it fits well and is about knee length. I ordered a Medium and I’m 5’4 and 154lbs. However there were a few things that I disliked, there was a thread that I slightly pulled on which caused the top part of the dress slightly detach itself from the bottom part. I hand sewed it back together, just didn’t want to deal with having to send it back. Overall it’s a pretty dress, but it’s cheaply made. The top part is thin and has no form to it, but it’s not see through. I would not buy this item again nor recommend to a friend. So it’s up to you to decide if you want a cheaply made but pretty in color and style dress for a decent price. You get what you pay for pretty much thumbs it up."
3.0,I am 5’10 and this dress is short waisted. The skirt length is great!  Color is darker than the photo.  The fabric is soft and pockets are great!
3.0,It does work and I do recommend it.
3.0,barely see the charms
3.0,Zipper broke on the first day of use
3.0,These are super cute but I’ve only worn them a few times and the glitter is coming off. It’s very noticeable so I doubt I’ll be able to wear them all summer.
3.0,"They are very cute earrings.  However, I am a bit disappointed at the size of them.  They are very tiny.  I guess I didn't read the dimensions carefully (less than the size of a dime).  I wish they were bigger!"
3.0,"This band looks great, but it doesn't fit the same way other third party solo loops of the same size do because it's not as soft and stretchy. Consider ordering a size up if you plan on getting this one."
3.0,"Get what you pay for, cheap and chinsy"
3.0,They are nice. I have a hard time with any heel at all but they are decent
3.0,"I love the look of this earring. It’s super dainty and comfortable. The only downfall is it’s not that secure. Every time i get out of the shower and I’m towel drying, the earring pops off."
3.0,"While these shoes fit great and were easy to break in (with squishy toe insert), they are NOT made well... had them maybe a month and they are pealing and wearing thru already.  About the 3rd rehearsal, they were already marred... not a mark, but a peal.  So, now the show is about to open, and these are looking too rough to wear!  Since these are tan, I am not even going to try and touch them up with shoe polish (although that might work for black).  Just FYI... you get what you pay for.. these were cheap, fit well, but are not going to last long."
3.0,It was very uncomfortable the clasp was not finished well. I think you get what you pay for.
3.0,"It's too big.  I'm petite. I like my clothes too compliment my small frame and shape.  This fit was just too big. I understand the concept, but dang."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, it was beautiful on but the V neck was way too low for the occasion I was intending to wear this dress to. I thought I would be able to pin the neck line a little for modesty but the way the neck line is cut it would look funny. The color and pattern was just as expected but I realized when I moved into the sun the dress was see through. I wanted to keep it and buy a slip and try to get the neck line professionally altered but I realized that would cost me more money than I actually paid for the dress."
3.0,I thought they'd be a little smaller than advertised
3.0,"This is a very pretty dress and very flowy, in the neckline the piece of fabric that flips in tens not to sit well and shows the inner part of your dress in the neckline. The hip is also extremely tight in comparison to the chest of the dress."
3.0,"It's an ok bowtie and probably what would be expected for the price.  The tie itself is a satan material, but on the smaller side of bowties.  Not small as far as fitting around the neck, just the bow ends are a little narrow.  The construction is ok, you will get a couple of uses out of it.  Again, for the price it's an ok buy."
3.0,it's definitely not for a petite figure. i felt like i was wearing a circus tent. it's much cuter on the model.
3.0,So cute but super thin fabric. Not great quality and no inner lining. Only gave 3 stars because it’s really really cute for the price!
3.0,I wish it wasn't bright fake gold colored & it got here with an extra chain on half of it that made it not work so I had to take that piece off...not the end of the world for the price. Its way better then $10 or $20....I think I paid under $5 for it & its cute for an occasional outfit so I recommend it overall.
3.0,Always fills up with condensation.  It also doesn't stay wound long after all day self winding. Always needs the time re-adjusted
3.0,"Great material...very sturdy, but fit in the legs is a little large."
3.0,Love the look and feel but it’s very long.  Hard to tuck and look right.  I am short so I’m sure that’s part of it.
3.0,Would be nice if it came in different sizes so that a good fit could be obtained.
3.0,It didn't fit comfortably so I ordered another pair that's one size bigger.
3.0,"Bought an 8 thinking regular Crocs are wide, but these weren't as wide. They fit but probably only for a short time. They're made out of nothing but sponge, so they won't last long. But for the price, they aren't a bad deal."
3.0,Only wore it a handful of times before it broke.
3.0,Love it. Just too tight in shoulders. Going to have a seamstress help.
3.0,"The purse is very cute but a little too big for a handbag. It needed a shoulder strap due to its size, but it only has Handles...but still very cute and nice quality"
3.0,I brought these for my boyfriend for our upcoming vacation and he could barley move in them. He really like the look of them though
3.0,"Let’s be honest, these are not expensive sandals, which is a huge plus so I can’t dock them too much for that. However, I wore them for 3 hours and the sole began falling apart. If you need them for a single event and they don’t need to look nice the whole time, they’ll work for you, otherwise, you might want to give these a pass and spend a little more for some that are nicer. They also run exceptionally small, so order big."
3.0,Three stars because the corset is nice. Xxl more like l or xl....
3.0,"This is a super cute shirt. It was a little smaller than I expected for a medium. It was more like a small. I am hoping it will fit my daughter for her graduation on the 23rd. If not, I will be returning it."
3.0,"Squished my breasts, uncomfortable. I am 5'9 and 180lbs, 38dd, got an XL and it was waaaaaaay too tight."
3.0,"Doesn't stay on when hands get wet. Comes with plenty of replacements, though. Better than nothing. The BlingGuard bling dots (for earrings), on the other hand, work great!"
3.0,"I didn’t care for the fit of this top.  I’ve ordered a few in this brand and have kept most of them.  This was kind of frumpy on me and looked kind of like a maternity top, too.  Maybe it’s my build."
3.0,"These look really nice on.  However, they don't last as long as I had hoped because they do turn and aren't the silver color your originally purchased."
3.0,not as advertized
3.0,not very white
3.0,"Decent for the money, seem to wash well.  Have used a couple of times so far and they help.  Just started cycling.  Padding is foam, so not sure how they compare to gel shorts.  But, again for money they are decent."
3.0,"I ordered several of these tops. They all fit differently, so it's tough. Some end up being a bit short, most of them run longer. Not super great quality, already a few of my favorite ones have threads coming loose after just six months, but they did last six months of wearing them almost every day for work so there's that. Definitely some I like better than others. The green and black, maroon, and polka dot are the best fits. The ones with the flowers run short and don't look as good.<br /><br />Also it's good to know some are SEE THROUGH. The solid colored ones are better but the ones with the flowers are absolutely see through. Take caution with that.<br /><br />Still, it's good to hide that I carry all my weight in my midsection without wearing a mumu, and look professional. I'll probably buy some more now that I know which ones work and which ones don't."
3.0,Small and took forever to arrive
3.0,Look good. Fit is a bit too tight tight even for women. Made for smaller head
3.0,The face cover does not stay on.  Already lost it.  But the band is great!
3.0,"Pros: The case has a mirror, comes with lens case, eye droppers, rubber end tweezers, and small contact case. Also holds the eye glasses. Construction was made from thin plastic with a soft velvet on top. The eye droppers work really well for those times you need some solution or just to put some drops in your eyes. You can keep solution in one and eye drops in the other. I keep solution in both, because I use the solution as eye drops. The construction works fine, hinges aren't squeaky.<br /><br />Cons: The contact case leaked, so I had to replace it with another one. Unfortunately, the make of the case only fits that tiny case. I was able to push a bigger contact case into it denting the sides into the position for the bigger contact case. The material of the case for glasses doesn't feel like it should be in contact with glasses. I keep an extra glass cleaner cloth over my glasses just in case.  The mirror no longer sticks to the case, which is an easy glue fix.<br /><br />All in all its what I wanted to have both items at hand I really like the eye droppers the best, I've found it very convenient to have this around, but if you aren't willing to put up with the rest of the things I've mentioned then maybe a simpler case would be better for you."
3.0,"I ordered an extra large because i'm 5'7 and a 38DDD, but its kind of tight on my thighs and hips. I am keeping it because if i lose some weight it'll look super cute!"
3.0,Bathrobe is too long and not thick. Quality I can give  you 3.5 stars
3.0,The size I chose was a large it was a very pretty dress the style just didn’t look right on me. But it’s a gorgeous dress
3.0,Fit is small and material is not very comfortable
3.0,There is too much lining inside.  You have to keep pushing it down.
3.0,"The ONLY issue I have with this is that it BUNCHES in the back! I have a short torso (I am 5ft 4in), and this piece totally creates this weird creasy fold that just looks 100% unflattering in every way!! Totally defeats the purpose of wearing it :(<br />I thought that being able to pull it down to flatten it out would help, but alas...it did not.<br />I thought because it was a bit more reinforced (with snaps AND zipper combo) that I wouldn't have that issue with bunching, but it didn't make a difference<br /><br />I would probably just keep looking for something that was more of a full body (like down to mid thigh area) in hopes that THAT doesn't bunch up in the same spot."
3.0,"I ordered this for my wife. The item runs small. While I was a fan of how it looked on her, she wasn't- she felt it pushed her cleavage out too much and was too short. She wanted to wear it for theme park outings and felt it was too risque."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't happen.  The fabric was nice, as was the pattern.  The issues were with the cut and fit of the dress.  It was a bit boxy up top, and the waist was more of an empire style then what is shown."
3.0,"This isn't one of the nicest handkerchiefs, the cotton is a little stiff but I'm hoping it will get softer over time. I am also not sure how absorbent it is considering its stiffness. It is a reasonable quality set for the price."
3.0,It's a nice.
3.0,"Dress is amazing and the fabric is as expected, very good quality. I’m giving 3 stars because it did not come with the shawl and that was a huge part of why I bought it. But the dress itself is amazing quality."
3.0,Love everything about this bra except it sometimes unclips at the cup area.
3.0,This mask is well made but the top of it kept sliding off my daughter's nose.
3.0,"A lil too bulky, makes a sweaty wrist, an uncomfortable use"
3.0,"I ordered a 2xl and it was too small in the shoulder,  but my sister loved it so I gave it to her."
3.0,"I purchased these slippers for my husband, who wears a size 9 1/2 shoe. The sizing indicates that these are men's slippers, and that the large (L) fits a men's shoe size 9 - 10. They were too tight, so I kept them for myself and ordered another pair for him in XL. The slippers are warm and fun to look at, but the soles are much too thin. It feels almost like you are walking barefoot, which on hardwood floors, is not very comfortable. We have owned many different pairs of  slippers similar to these, but they had more cushioned and thicker soles. I expect the soles will wear through pretty quickly with these. If they added more cushion on the bottom and a thicker sole, I would rate these 5 stars."
3.0,It kind of took forever to get to me and one of the jewels is glued on weirdly but it was so cheap so I can't complain. And it is pretty colors. I like the long length too.
3.0,Returned.  It was comfortable but didn't fit like I was hoping.  Too tight in the chest.
3.0,Cute top but collar too loose.. doesn’t look right button all the way up .
3.0,ok kind of small
3.0,"This dress is very pretty! However, I am 5’4 and 115lbs and the extra small was still too big :( i was able to wear it but there was a lot of extra fabric in the under boob/upper stomach area."
3.0,"They are a bit flimsy, some broke easily and some didn’t turn on. But the kids enjoyed them and it added lots of fun to the party!"
3.0,I order these watch bands and they are awesome. I am disappointed that that I didn't get them on time like I should have gotten them with prime. Other than not getting them on time they are really sharp looking and comfortable. They fit well on my Amazfit bit u pro..
3.0,This arrived today. It’s a nice suit; the fabric feels good. But this is a poor quality zipper; the zipper was damaged right out of the bag. I didn’t even get to try it on.
3.0,"With a recent desire to craft I purchased these with the intent to use for myself and as gifts. Ultimately I do not suggest using these with hardcover books. It will inevitably destroy the spines as it creates too much of a gap. I dont think these would hinder paperbacks spines, provided you do not put any pressure on the closed cover.<br /><br />Thoughts....<br /><br />1.Thicker than I expected, most closely comparable to a nickel. To thick for hardcover books.<br />2. Not very ""polished"" looking / some more tarnished than others. Although this could be dismissed as ""character"" or ""aged"" look.<br />3. Recieved 2 out of 30 bent, not bad in my opinion considering they're shipped in a bubble-wrap polymailer. With a small amount of pressure I could easily straighten the pieces.<br />4. Short in length, which I like due to varying book heights, no worries of it being too long.<br />5. The ""hooked"" end was too small for my book. It barely reached the spine of my book and had I added any charms/beads it would have left an indent in the spine. Allowing no space for added decoration.<br /><br />I borrow books from the local library a lot and would like to think it would frowned upon if I damage the spines of their books.<br /><br />I plan to compare these to the options available from my local craft store and to the already finished versions that are available within bookstores to see how they measure up in thickness, length and compatibility with both paperback and hardcover books before deciding if it's worth the return or not."
3.0,They were a lot smaller than expected but they do keep the items cold while you shop.
3.0,"It fits small for the size but it also fit up to my chin, very uncomfortable to me. My granddaughter said she would wear it so I didn't return it. It was very soft and pretty."
3.0,"These are cute and comfortable for my younger child, but too small for kids over 9."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:1bcd36d6b743af2a4da5f7d3ff78d5e9]] Tarnished and turned my finger green. Definitely not sterling silver. Also had 3 “diamonds” fall out with the first 90 days
3.0,I think they need to rewrite the description for this one. It's really a crinkled rustic orange scarf. Not what I was expecting but I still like it.
3.0,"I love the way it is made, it is a little long in the mid section.  The breast cups need some underwire to hold your breasts in place."
3.0,Dress fit small according to measurements
3.0,Smaller than I expected. They are the size of normal dice much smaller than the dice in the movie
3.0,"These sleeves do not offer compression. They are made as though my biceps are the same size as my wrists, meaning that the cuff at my wrists is very loose. I really wanted to like these, but am disappointed, as I was looking for an item that is &#34;fitted&#34; at both ends, and offers compression, which these do not. The fabric is rather thin...feels almost as though I just inserted my arms into some panty hose. Oh well."
3.0,"Its ok.  Put it on my G Watch R.  Still using it.  Paint is wearing in a few small places, but it mostly still looks shiny and black.  Its comfortable, and i haven't developed any strange rashes wearing the watch from 7am until around midnight every day.  For the price, absolutely recommend it if you're looking to replace the stock strap with something metal.  Definitely feels better and than some of the really cheap oyster bands on amazon.  It has some decent heft to it.  Width seems to be a consistent 22mm around."
3.0,"Thw hoodie looks great. But, it sheds so much fuzz even after washing that we have to return it. Just fuzz all over my husband and all over the house."
3.0,I bought these hoping they would breath better than my cotton socks off the same style. They don't. They make my feet sweaty and they pick up lots of dirt from the floors when I'm barefoot.
3.0,ITS A LITTLE BIG
3.0,Tops were a bit tight / binding - wife said they feel like they are going to fall down.
3.0,This dress is pretty and the material was soft but I just didn't like how it looked on me. I am about 5'4 260 lbs and I bought a 2X but maybe a 3X would have been better. In any case I sent it back. It is kind of narrow at the bottom which I thought was a little weird
3.0,"I ordered a M, which is supposed to be for waist up to 29 inches. My waist is 27.5 and it can barely fit around the waist."
3.0,"Thick and warm, but I took off a star because the workmanship is not as fine as it looks in the photo, and another because of the oily &#34;factory&#34; smell. .. Add the price of &#34;dry cleaning' to it's cost."
3.0,"**The first time wearing these, the decorative metal piece broke and was flopping around. Lowering to 3 stars due to quality.<br /><br />I have wide feet and large ankles so I have a hard time finding cute sandals that fit. I love oka-b sandals, they always fit!"
3.0,"I am 5’3” and ordered up a size.  This product is soft and the quality is suitable for what I paid.  However,  these are low rise and run very very small."
3.0,"Great idea to make your own straps. But the strap (made of nylon I'm guessing) is very smooth and frankly too soft. It would not be worthy of securing things for long distances and things of important as the straps can slip loose, because of being so smooth. It does not hold the grip of the plastic clips."
3.0,Nice bag for a tablet. 15” laptop wouldn’t fit.
3.0,"Very pretty gloved that are comfortable and the touch screen works great. They do not, however, keep your hands warm in NJ weather. Bummer 😞😞"
3.0,Tore fairly easy on the birds chest. Maybe a sewing issue from factory. We used duct tape to be able to wear on Halloween. Funny suit tho.
3.0,A little big much to long and seriously everything sticks to this dress. You will need a lint roller
3.0,"These are great pants.  I love them for around the house.  I like the wide waistband, it doesn't have a lot of seaming so it's not itchy.  They are 3/4 length and have deep enough pockets for your phone.  The pants are more of a silky material rather than a cozy soft material like other joggers.  That's really my only complaint.  So yes, they are soft, but not the buttersoft fabric I was expecting."
3.0,Pro - came with tools to remove spring bars and came with 3 spring bars.<br /><br />Con - holes and ends are cut with heat. Not holding up well. It is fraying.
3.0,These are cheap looking and quite a thick post.  Not the best.
3.0,I thought this was going to be cozy but it was a little too thin and light weight for what I was looking for. Plus the sleeves were way too long and I thought it was unflattering and looked a little cheap. But I guess it WAS only 20 bucks. I sent it back and will keep looking.
3.0,Fit was fine but they were described as high waisted and they are not.
3.0,I don't like it because my check book doesn't fit in it
3.0,"bought as a gift - she loved it and wore it almost immediately. Presentation is lovely, and the little printed card on the inside really sold me on it - it summed up our friendship so nicely and really made it all perfect. Overall, great for a not too expensive gift"
3.0,"The color is nice, the fabric is soft. The dress runs large. I bought a medium and wished I had gone smaller. It fits like a sack."
3.0,"Looks just like it from the anime, kinda small. It only fits on my pinky and barely my ring finger without getting stuck."
3.0,"Too much bling, more for a teenager"
3.0,The wallet is a good credit card holder but it has some not finished or glued material left in some of the pockets [especially in the window slot] that make it hard to get your drivers licence and cards out.
3.0,5X only if you are talking youth not womens sizes . Thankfully my granddaughter liked it for a sleepshirt.
3.0,Much smaller than is shown in pic.Thin tee fabric.
3.0,Bought to work I not comfy at all
3.0,"I found these socks to be slightly uncomfortable. I bought them for practicing yoga and barre because of the anti-slip feature, and while practicing barre you tend to be up on your toes a lot. These socks seem to kind of dig into the skin between each of my toes, but perhaps that's just the nature of the sock, with them being toe socks. Apart from when standing up on my toes, they fit okay and are somewhat comfortable."
3.0,"Smaller than it looks but, still really cute!"
3.0,one of the necklaces broke within minutes of putting it on:(
3.0,Padding is light
3.0,I bought this because the fitbit kept falling off my belt. The wristband works but it is bulky so I stopped wearing it. Its not an issue with the wristband itself but the fitbit ONE just isnt made to be a on the wrist in my opinion. I need to find a way to keep it on my belt without having to be worried about losing it.
3.0,"The slots for the credit cards etc. are so narrow and stiff that it is almost impossible to get them out of the slots.  Also, it wasn't exactly what I wanted because I like a place for the checkbook and register like Buxton used to make for ladies wallet."
3.0,"I have small-medium wrists (170mm) and based off sizing I am a ""large."" I bought all 3 sizes and small is TOO small, medium is very snug- hoping with time it will stretch (as of right now it is snug to the point where I have watch marks on my skin and have to switch between right and left wrists), and large is loose. The product itself is fine, feels durable."
3.0,Came little bit smaller then expected.
3.0,"I got the three pack of red, black, and gray. The red and gray fit perfectly, but the black one has a strange fit around the bottom part of the arm openings that makes it flare outward and not hug the body. It's like the seams or measurements are a bit off or something."
3.0,"Really liked the style and design,however,could not wear it on our trip because it was too tight."
3.0,order size a up
3.0,Shirt was fine but too short even for an average man - if you are on the taller side - no go
3.0,"Was not what I expected, not large enough but nice hats."
3.0,The oils don’t seem to stay on the bracelet long. You have to keep adding oils.
3.0,Ordered a size up and was still WAY too small... has nothing to adjust so it is a risky move.. other than that I like the design of the bathing suit but will have to return
3.0,Should have ordered the next size smaller
3.0,"It's not a maxi skirt. I'm 5'7, got an L and it's mid shin length. It's still a nice skirt though."
3.0,"The color was nice, seams well done.  A bit on the small side..."
3.0,"UPDATED REVIEW:<br />I have used this bag for about a week and the draw string enclosure on the top completely ripped out....very disappointed.  It is the main way to keep all your stuff in the bag as you are moving around since there is no zipper to close the bag - only the buckle on the outside.  Also, I can't even sew the material back on because it is all frayed at the ends.  If I try, I know it will only happen again.<br /><br />YES.<br /><br />I am a 4'11&#34; female.  I purchased this as a bag to hold my camera when I ride my motorcycle.  I wanted a one strap, cross body style bag, that wasn't too big, but also not too small.  This bag is perfect!<br /><br />I have a Nikon D7200 which fits nice inside the main compartment with extra space.  I suggest to anyone who wants to use this bag to hold a camera, to purchase a padded camera insert for the bag to keep it protected when you put the bag down on hard surfaces - the bag itself is not padded.  There are lots of pockets, compartments, and zippers for keeping things organized.  You can fit some standard MOLLE pouches and accessories on the bag as well as velcro patches if you want.  There is also a nice water bottle holder on the side.<br /><br />Most people suggested to wear this as an over-the-shoulder or cross body bag that sits near the hip, but I tightened the strap as far as it could go so that it sits on the upper most part of my back - away from my waist for when I ride.  It feels more like a backpack that way."
3.0,This is from across seas so watch the size.
3.0,"Really Three-and-a-Half Stars. In theory this is the best designed bag out there because it's easy to hang it in a tall locker, it holds a lot, and it's easy to organize sports and dress clothing with it. Here's the problem. The first Glo Bag I bought lasted about 4+ years under very regular abuse. The second one I purchased about 6 months ago and it's already wearing out. These are not being manufactured like they used to be. The design is still great. But the quality has gone down significantly. I would gladly pay more for a product that will last me longer. I hope Glo Bag is reading this. If they can make a quality product for even over $100 it will be worthwhile."
3.0,"Super cute slippers. Very bummed the fit is really tight and narrow. I would definitely buy different style or mens if you wanted a comfortable fit, unless your feet are very narrow."
3.0,I order size 7/8 - 4T and  2T all the same color and style but for some reason my size 4T come in in a different color !!!
3.0,Product was well received within in the posted time frame and packaged professionally.  Poster was a little smaller than I had expected but was in good condition.
3.0,Good from a distance.
3.0,"Neat concept, but absolutely huge and heavy!"
3.0,"Thicker fabric so better for spring or fall.<br /><br />For those that are blessed on the backside, it can leave a gap between the body and the straps"
3.0,The zipper get stock. Unable to zipper out or open it  to expensive for a bad quality
3.0,Super cute watch but it occasionally will stop working. I have to reset it almost everyday.
3.0,"I really like the style and the feel of linen. But this shirt or the manufacturer doesn't know how to size anything. I purchased size X-Large because I wear a size large. This shirt has to be between and Small - Medium. Don't go by the size chart for this shirt, it's way way off. May have to go 2 to 3 extra sizes to get this to fit correctly."
3.0,This is a nice compact case.  It’s durable and will offer great protection for your Walkers game ears.  I just wish it had Velcro straps on the bottom so I could attach it to my molle plate in my vehicle.  Other then that I am happy with this product.
3.0,the inseam and waist are as described and are comfortable. The only fault is the rise from the crouch is very short and does not contain a fly.
3.0,"I bought this swimsuit  at the and of summer last year. Did not get around to wear it.till.this summer. It's very cute and love the ruffles. But be aware that white fabric from lining shows around the chest area. No matter how much you adjust the straps, the white lining from the inside shows. Besides that, it is a great swimsuit. I dont wear it as often because I end up spending more time adjusting it and trying to make sure it looks good. If that was not an issue, I would gladly order it in another color or print."
3.0,"Top is pretty, but the size is not accurate."
3.0,This is very pretty but there is only 1 bead. That was disappointment.
3.0,Sizing is too small!
3.0,"Liked the quality material, definitely would be appropriate for work, but it was not flattering on me. Looked more like a sack from the side (I'll spare you that pic), I think maybe if you have a smaller butt and little to no stomach it would work great though."
3.0,They were cute and my daughter grew into them. But she is now 5 months and she is just starting to be able to wear them. But they are adorable.
3.0,I like them a lot but they are crooked. I'm going to try and fix them without breaking them. Wish me luck.
3.0,"These will work for their intended costume purpose, but unless your pinkie is the same length as your middle finger, the fit is quite poor. Couldn't stop laughing at my alien talons though hahah"
3.0,The color of the chain I chose online is different from the one I received and it’s short. I definitely won’t buy anything else
3.0,Looks different in reality
3.0,Pants were great for my birthday will order more soon
3.0,Much smaller then expected.
3.0,"I like these, but they are bit see through. Very comfortable!"
3.0,"I ordered a size up from what I usually wear, and it still was snug across my back and didn’t even come close to covering my bottom. I’ll keep it because I plan to lose a few pounds, but it didn’t fit at all like the picture."
3.0,I bought this kit mainly for the beard cape and it does the job. The suction cups work well too!<br />The hair cutting cloak neck is too small for an adult. I’m able to get it over my head but can’t velcro it closed. I still use it when I cut my hair but its not great. I end up getting some hair on the floor if I move too much.
3.0,"Nice but the sizer is clear plastic not black as advertised, this makes it look cheap so I returned. It is comfortable and fabric is nice."
3.0,"I purchased this to wear under light summer dresses and rompers. There were no instructions included, but application wasn't too hard to figure out. This was VERY sticky when I took the plastic protective film off. I loosened the strings and placed it on, then tightened the strings. It gave me great cleavage, but the bottom part seemed like it was too loose? It just didn't fit that well for me I guess. I wore it all day one day, and it was so sticky that it hurt when I took it off, so be very gentle when removing. It may help to use warm soapy water when doing so! It also rubbed a small rash on my ribs underneath where it rested because I believe it was a tad too big for me. I'm a 34B and bought the B size.<br />P.S. - It was A LOT less sticky after the 1st application."
3.0,"The pants are really nice if your a 6 ft tall model. I took 3 pair to the  alteration shop to have them shortened and that alone cost me 75.00 so unless your tall enough to wear them plan on the extra cost of shortening them. Gorgeous, comfy and costly."
3.0,"These aren’t compression tanks and they are very thin. I really wanted a white tank but this will have to be layered, which I didn’t want to do. The black and grey tanks are fine, but nothing special or that I’d purchase again. I have another set coming from a different brand. Hopefully those are better and I’ll return these."
3.0,"The lenses flip down, not up.  They and the frames are in the way when you try to apply eye makeup."
3.0,Way too large but I like the style and material...I will exchange for a smaller size
3.0,"They show off your booty really well, but I'm 5'3, 115 lbs, 36&#34; hips, and they were still big. Makes them look a little baggy. Not horrible, but not tight and tiny like the picture either."
3.0,I love buying these headbands because I love headwear and I love when it's cheap they may not last long and they may turn ish for the price you got a good couple months use out of them but they come in a timely manner I'm tryna you're beautiful when they come but they may  turn this and start to smellstill worth the buy
3.0,It is good but I don't  like the long because  not is long is medium
3.0,It's very pretty material but runs way too large
3.0,The quality of the dress in the picture and the one I received was very different. The one I received had a completely different lace than the ones shown in the picture. I literally looked line a dress yu buy at the Halloween costume store. cheap material but for the price it was expected.
3.0,beautiful. feel nice and soft. they are only printed on one side which limits they ways in which i can use them. if they were printed on both side they would be my favorites. One side printing. Boo.
3.0,Removed a sticker from the side of the mug.  It took off the paint.  Now I have noticible part of the mug with a sticker shape part blank spot
3.0,Ok but ran small.  It’s not going to last long that is for sure.  One top and it’s history
3.0,"These are typical cropped leggings, nothing really special. I would say my Nike's are more comfortable overall. I was hoping these would be a bit more 'high rise' and a softer fabric as many reviews alluded to so that was somewhat disappointing. Most likely will not repurchase and keep searching for something more comparable to LLL."
3.0,Very small in calf area.  Had to have a stretchable insert in order to wear them.  Extra cost.
3.0,"Nice, soft material. Debated between XL and L, got the L. It is very long. A little baggy, but not oversized. Extremely comfortable. I would maybe order an XL next time to get that more oversized look, but then it might be too long."
3.0,"The style is cute and really popular, and the fit on this was OK, but the material felt really scratchy and not breathable.  returning and will buy from another brand, as several other sellers have this similar item in cotton instead of polyester."
3.0,"Cute, but bottoms don't go as high up on my waist as I would like, but still cute for price. Cupshe quality was a little bit nicer, for instance the material was a little thinner than the Cupshe suit a had previously ordered as a gift for someone."
3.0,very long had to get them shortened.
3.0,"Meets the minimal requirement of having a belt.  However, the strap that holds the belt became detached after one use."
3.0,"Not quite strong enough.  But the next level up is too strong.  However, these are ultra light and ultra flexible and I like them.  I'd just like them much more if I could see well with them."
3.0,"I debated giving these a higher star. They are very cute and seem to be of good quality, but they are too small. My calf is barely 15” but I struggled to get these on and had to remove them after less than an hour due to cutting off circulation. If you have small calves I’d definitely recommend these, but they don’t fit the advertised 9”-16+” calf."
3.0,"Love the style, but so thin you need to wear a slip under it."
3.0,did not fit gave it to my friend.
3.0,"The fit is great, but I don't like how the dress stretches.  The stretch makes it appear white on the chest, and it doesn't take much to stretch it like that.  The dress fit very loosely,  but it still stretched white.  If it stretched black it would be perfect.  It's just too thin."
3.0,"Sizing is inconsistent. I ordered a black pair a few months ago in my normal size and they fit great and I love them! Being that I love that pair so much I ordered the 3-pk (black, gray and red) in the exact same size as my first pair and I can’t even get them half way up my thigh. I’m so sad I had to return them."
3.0,The stone was missing.  This is the second ring that I have bought. The first one the stone fell out.  I’m not sure what they use to keep the stone in place but they need to do a better job.  The ring is very nice though.
3.0,"It's heavy-knit like a sweater but the collar is very thin and awkwardly loose. Logo is also too big, but I guess I knew that buying it. Not what I was expecting or wanting but I'm sure it'll be someone's lucky grab at a second-hand store"
3.0,Cute to mix it up in the Spring and Summer
3.0,"The hat is very cute, and fairly warm.  My issue is, that the lining isn't really connected to the wool of the hat, so the fit is awkward.  It always feels as if I need to adjust it, so not as comfortable as I'd like."
3.0,Product is cheaply made not impressed
3.0,Make sure you have extremely course ground coffee if you're filling it.  Ours overflowed onto the table and floor.
3.0,"Big thick belt. Had to cut off that loop. Works better now. Hey, it was $5. what do you want for $5?"
3.0,To big for my son who always wears a 6-7
3.0,It was a size or two smaller than shown on the chart.
3.0,It fit everywhere else I’m muscular and the arms even forearms were super tight. I’m only 135lbs so not a big person. But I still like it ok quality.
3.0,"Beautiful looking, too thin though."
3.0,Love the hoodie but the sleeves are super short
3.0,"Fits a bit large and is a nylon/polyester feel to it. I was attracted to the pattern, but it’s not my go to mask."
3.0,"For me the shoe looks good and fits good but it's not a good shoe to wear all day, it doesn't breathe properly and your feet feel it. It is not a shoe that I would recommend for work ..."
3.0,"I mean don’t get me wrong, i will still wear it because i paid for it lol but it does NOT come as pictured. Different designed shirt, not the tie-dye. Fit and material are fine. The decal is as pictured."
3.0,"I am writing this review about 6 months after purchase, and after 6 months of using and washing. Until now, it was a nice looking shirt. But, the last time it was washed, the white detail started coming off the shirt. I don't think I can wear it again now."
3.0,Good watch. Good quality. The Zebra stripes were a little more distinct in person than in the picture. Wasn't the look that was wanted. Returned it because of it but it is a good watch if that's the look your looking for.
3.0,The print is cute but I was disappointed with how see through it is. I wanted something loose and flown but I’ll need to wear a tank top under it
3.0,Good case but it has a terrible smell. I’m letting it air out with fabreeze & baking soda. If this doesn’t help I’ll have to get a new one from a different brand.
3.0,It does run small. I think made in China based on the tags on the shirt. I wear large and ordered xl. Star deducted for that and one for it being shiny and not a good cotton tee. Not really worth 15 bucks.
3.0,"I am 5'9"", 160#.  I am breastfeeding so my chest is a little larger than it used to be, but I ordered a large and the top is VERY short. It barely covers the bottom of my boobs. I'm going to try an XL and see if it is better.<br />Otherwise the color is beautiful and I am excited to wear this if it works out."
3.0,"I got this for a Mother’s Day present, she said the shoulders and top were great but the waist was too small, too bad it’s really cute I will have to return it"
3.0,My boyfriend usually has room in size L but this one was tight from the start.
3.0,too bulky for me around the waist.
3.0,Color a bit unexpected but fits great
3.0,They are a good buy for the value my child enjoys wearing them
3.0,everyone says it runs small and it does.  I wear xl and I got 4x wow it was still tight
3.0,The material feels nice but Amazon has up the wrong size chart!  I bought an XL based on the chart and it's way too big.  My Mom wears a 16 in blouses and it's huge on her!  I think a L would have been fine for her and a M for me.  I've given my Mom the blouse but she will have to take it in to get it to fit properly.
3.0,"I had to wear a slip under it, but otherwise comfortable. I ordered it as an XL thinking that they might run small but I would've been okay with a large. Fit is a little awkward but with a belt, it's great. Pockets=huge added bonus"
3.0,"This is a cute charm as shown here, real large, but it's hard to see and differentiate the flowers with its actual size."
3.0,Ok quality.. doesn’t seal well around the nose.
3.0,Was a gift to an employee and it lost all the color in a matter of days. The neckless is pretty but the point was it was her birthstone.
3.0,Even smaller after I washed it.
3.0,"Looks much cheaper in real life than it does in the picture. Also, it's quite large."
3.0,Lovely dress...not right fit for me.  I believe this perfect for ladies no taller than bout 5'8. After that proportions not right for we vertical gals. I'm 5'10.5 not good look but beautiful dress if U are average height. I returned but if you are average height I think you'll love it.
3.0,I didn't receive all the colors that were in the picture
3.0,"Looks lovely, but it is not made for tall women with long arms."
3.0,not an actual sweatshirt. strange material.
3.0,Do not put in the dryer unless you want it a size smaller
3.0,"I wanted a cute mask, but this didn't stay on my face we'll. The gems made it heavy to stay up."
3.0,"inside separated from the silver part fairly quickly.  Other than that, it's cute."
3.0,"I love the material and the design if only the sizing was correct, luckily my son's girlfriend can wear them"
3.0,"The product is same as shown , and it has a clean look (it is not glossy )  but it is very much appealing, the return shipping for this item is not free ,  they charged me 6 dollars for return ."
3.0,"I typically wear a small, but this doesn't quite cover my chest. The fabric is very silky, which I wasn't expecting."
3.0,Not ani and Alex bracelet. Very cheap.
3.0,"The zipper for the pockets are very low quality , in my first week of use they are already stuck"
3.0,"the colors are beautiful but it has different shape than the pictures (see the pleats in the skirt) it has much more volume on the bottom and much wider. i cant be sure how is it on the body because my daughter is trying it for her cousin and she is one size smaller than her.<br />the quality is not very high, not very good sewing job but you can't see it in general look. for this price I expect for higher quality."
3.0,"This is a nice raincoat, but I'm giving it three stars as the plastic knobs that are at the end of the ties are fairly cheaply made and broke before the first use."
3.0,"All the plasic bits break if you wear them for more than a week, but they're good if you are just getting them to give away with piercings"
3.0,"The colors are not as vibrant as pictured, but still neat to have. My kids love Among Us and any gear they can get their heads (or in this case feet) on."
3.0,"The hat works well. However, I find the strap doesn't always work well."
3.0,"Really cute dress, fit as expected but when it arrived it was damaged in some areas. The thread where it's crocheted was torn so some holes were much bigger than others."
3.0,My daughter is in a 11/12 . This outfit was too big.  She's slim we ordered her correct size but it's not for lil 11 or 12 yr old that are slim fit .. Go down a size
3.0,I didn’t like them the eye lens are super short. They are a take off of a pair I have they look the same but this one - the glass lens  are much shorter; not wide enough to really see through!
3.0,"Everything was great on this ""Shacket"" however, I was needing a heavier weight to use in colder outdoors. This was very nice material and color! It just did not fit my exact need in a 'coat'."
3.0,Small and tight but very cute
3.0,Color is beautiful however the spaghetti strap ripped even before I tried it on.
3.0,"These pants are okay. They did not WOW me, but they still do that job. They did appear to be very small however when I tried them on they fit well. The cuffed ankle does make the pants a little parachute like and like a costume."
3.0,Nice design and cool look.  It is heavy for a keychain.
3.0,I really like these socks. They don’t really keep my feet warm since they are knitted. But they are so cute with short boots!<br />Updated— After wearing these a few times the material hurts the bottom of my feet when standing for long periods of time.  I can’t wear them anymore.
3.0,"Measurement was length of belt not waist size, so had to return. Seemed very sturdy, buckle seemed cheap but looks like they would hold up OK."
3.0,"I thought these would be great for travel and camping. They are very lightweight and the material feels good to stand on. They look nice, too. The length was just right but the arch straps were a bit tight and the toe straps caught on my little toes, so I returned them."
3.0,The dress is cute but looks like a maternity dress  so returned
3.0,Its a good sturdy shoe but they don't stay lit for very long.
3.0,i wasnt as happy with this as i wanted to be it was a little tight and awkward it didnt feel as nice as i would have liked If my review helped you in anyway please hit the button.
3.0,Love the shirt but it runs on the small size.  No give.  Washes good and holds it's color.
3.0,Yo large
3.0,"I kinda like these socks and kinda don't. They are soft and comfortable, fit a bit larger than similar socks, but look kinda like hospital socks? I wanted a neutral color, and they are that, but what you can see above my shoe just looks a little weird."
3.0,Product wise good but its too tight at waist
3.0,The pants were way too short and a little tight.. That's what I get for ordering online.
3.0,Very pretty but runs large.
3.0,Pretty but tight in the chest area and shorter than it looked in the picture.
3.0,"So totally should have read the reviews first, because just as everyone said the earrings just roll around on the chain because it isn’t fused to the metal. Mine also came with one fan obviously larger than the other. But! They get three stars because it was an easy fix. I trimmed down the large fan to match the other, and a little bead glue from michaels stopped all the spinning and movement."
3.0,Earrings are very long. But I have long hair so they worked out. Color is a bit darker than expected but still nice
3.0,Cute but the stone it larger than my liking
3.0,I would have given it five stars as the material was really nice and thick but it was a bit large for me.  I was really disappointed about that as I now have to pay to have it adjusted.
3.0,Just all right not as expected
3.0,Do not like material at all
3.0,It works on smooth surfaces.
3.0,The ring was wider than expected
3.0,I need to replace a threaded rod as it is too short
3.0,"Because this wrap dress completely opens without a hole on the opposing side to draw the string into, it is rather “unfitted” on the chest area.  As a result it is sloppy looking and more or less works as a robe.  Otherwise I like the yellow color and flowing material"
3.0,"I loved this necklace and bought it in gold.  I wore it everyday and did not take it off.  Sadly the gold started to turn silver, so to keep it looking new, you need to take it off everyday."
3.0,"So it is the warmest coat I own, which was the point! But the zipper broke within a week, and it can’t be fixed. A shame, bec a coat that won’t zip doesn’t really do much."
3.0,Not functioning as pictured
3.0,"I was mistaken in thinking these were adult size earrings. Evidently the term ""cute"" in a Silver Speck product name means child's size. I bent the hoop on the one I tried on, and feel sure that it will break soon if I continue to use them. So, while these would be nice understated earrings for a child, they are not for us big people."
3.0,Fits smaller than the size listed.
3.0,I like the mask with dragon fly. Disappoint with the dragon fly being in center of mask instead of side like pictured. Thank you.
3.0,"If this fit true to size it would be awesome, but it doesn't, so it sucks.  It was very snug and it is really thin, so if you do wear it tight - don't get cold!"
3.0,Nice material and look but can give in easily if you mistakenly stretch it.
3.0,"made my ear hurt, but did the job fine other than that."
3.0,"In the picture it would seem like there are some sort of straps to go over your shoulders and hold the sleeves up, but it's not like that in real life. It's hard to explain, but long story short there's just weird random loops and the shoulder parts do not stay up on any body type and instead it just kind of falls down and bunches up on the chest and arms. It's still wearable but just does not hold itself up well so it works better if you wear something over it to kind of keep it in place."
3.0,Color is fantastic . Sleeves are thankfully long and go past my wrist. Front pockets are small and theres no other pockets. Coat was a lesser quality then I expected
3.0,"These slippers for women were a lot wider than the LUXEHOME Men's Slip On Indoor/Outdoor shoes. I found it odd that a man's shoe is narrower than a ladies shoe.  I do have a narrow foot, and was looking for a slipper that didn't fall off my feet when I walk. The soles were very flat in comparison also. The length was exactly as expected, and they are soft."
3.0,Looks can be deseaving<br /><br />Thought the whole thing was going to be that metal material but its fabric at the top and the fabric isnt the best quality!
3.0,"What I like - thin, soft, stretchy band and black small clasp that doesn't get hot or cold with the weather or bang on your face like large metal ones do.  Don't like that the button tension clasps sometimes lose their ability to hold the tension."
3.0,"I bought this since  I was downsizing my purse and needed to also downsize my wallet.  I use it only for a couple of cards, change, few dollars.  Its fine-BUT the color is not a pretty, clear, (or even vibrant as the description reads) color.  it is very gold and &#34;dirty&#34; yellow.  Maybe its my monitor, but it doesn't look good to me."
3.0,I like the band but why does the watch protector not fit correctly? The hole is on the wrong side.....disappointed.
3.0,This is the third time I ordered this item. The quality is not as good as before. I won't reorder it again.
3.0,Too small to fit shoes and ball
3.0,The dress looks good but the fabric is cheap.
3.0,The color of the dress is very pretty (does match the coloring posted) but the material is very thin and the jacket was not the same size as the dress.  This dress is made for someone with the physique of the model tall and thin (im average 5'7 somewhat large chest area). When I put the dress on it did not look at all like it does on the model (I could hardly tell the low/high hem which is the reason I bought the dress) so I had my daughter (who is 6ft and built like the model) put it on and the dress looked like it did on the model but the jacket was still too small on her (no way that jacket was a large).  My opinion of the dress is that it is very pretty (true to color) but very thin and will not give you the same look the model has if you are not on the tall and rather skinny size and you might have to forgo the jacket because it was not true to size very tight/little.
3.0,Pretty colors yet flimsy fabric. The bust area is tight for me but perhaps not an issue for some.
3.0,"Material is nice and stretchy, but waistline has no stretch. Can't zip it closed. Great material. Would've been a 5/5 stars."
3.0,"This binder has a thin, fuzzy lining in the front. Unlike my previous binder which was double thick nylon/spandex. The flannel like lining makes it even harder to get into this binder, and it is hotter than the double nylon. This is an important factor since I live in a subtropical climate. I wish  could return it, but I washed it before I noticed this change, so that's the reason for 1 star."
3.0,Hard to use because of elastic closure.
3.0,"I’m 5’8” and I ordered a XL, it was a little short. Fit okay, other than that."
3.0,"I love how Polarn products always have such high quality textiles.  The sizing is always generous so they tend to be a bit big at first but they can be worn longer.<br /><br />The reason for the 3 star rating on this particular item is the color.  On my screen, ""burnt coral"" looks like a pastel orange.  The one I received looked more like the way the ""flamingo pink"" leggings appear on my screen, which is more of a coral pink.  I bought these for my son so I didn't want pink.<br /><br />Normally, the colors for polarn products are very close in person to the screen so I didn't expect them to be more pink than orange.  All the other leggings I bought were as expected.  I'm going to keep them since I'm using them as a base layer for wearing at home.  If I had intended to use them out of the house, I would return them."
3.0,They are not long enough but boy are they beautiful and sparkly wow. Definitely keeping them.
3.0,The color and material was different than the pic
3.0,Son loves the mask but keeps falling apart. He's had to fix it multiple times.
3.0,I can't close on of the clasps. I'll have to fix them before I can wear them.
3.0,Great charm for my bracelet.
3.0,very thin material better for a nightgown
3.0,"Material very thin, came apart at seems on first wash!"
3.0,"I like the hat and the design, but it doesnt fit well because the picture stitched on the side is to thick and cause my ear to stick out. Works if you wear hat to the side a little, but not a good look"
3.0,"Wearing the suit dry,  it fits great.  As soon as I'm in the water,  the weight of the water pulls the top down and exposes my boobs. I've stitched the top to hold it better in place,  but it still is not comfortable to wear in public and trust I won't fall out. It could use a piece of elastic at the top before three sheer fabric. I wear the bottoms more often"
3.0,I would give 3.5 stars if I could. It's hard to click on and off. But no allergy symptoms so far. Over all it's ok for the price.
3.0,Looks cute and fits great !
3.0,The band is heavy and the face cover takes away from the apple trim making look like a lesser quality
3.0,Would have been better if hands were not white. That are hard to see on the white face.
3.0,"I loved the fit and style of the dress, but as other comments said the fabric is somewhat canvas like. Very stiff and uncomfortable."
3.0,"The fabric is bright and pretty, but this dress looks and feels cheap. Forget the sleeves--they started to tear off as soon as I put the dress on. I finished the job and cut them off. The construction of the rest of the dress doesn't seem to be much better.<br /><br />I will wear this around the house in the summer, but I don't know that I will wear it anywhere else."
3.0,"Cute, but made me look like I was bigger then a barn door!  The material was very heavy, which added extra volume."
3.0,These are nice looking earrings but they are too heavy for my ears.  I either need to use the lobe wonder earring patches or give them to our local thrift store.  Would not recommend if you don't like heavy earrings.
3.0,Great silicone rings. The only problem is that after awhile the black wears off and you will see the 2nd color begin to take over. Good thing you get multiple rings. I bought this pack because I liked 3 out of the 8 rings. Good price/deal for all 8.
3.0,Purse is okay.  Leather had an odd smell. Not typical genuine leather smell.
3.0,I don't like the silky feel. I was expecting cotton.
3.0,"They look great from far, but quality is far from great. Worked fine for a Halloween costume."
3.0,Not for him
3.0,It's a really beautiful mask; I have a huge head so it's a little more snug around my mouth than I am comfortable with. It looks great on my daughter though!
3.0,"This dress is beautiful and fit well. However, the cardigan sleeves were too small in the upper arm. I noticed in the reviews that others have had this same problem. It is a shame because I really liked the dress and hated to return it."
3.0,"Ordered a small based off of sizing and didn't try it on right away. Went on a trip and packed it, but was too big overall when I went to wear it. Unfortunately for me, I want able to return/ exchange it because window to do so had passed."
3.0,"Has everything it should have. Really nice hat. What I'm going to say next. Most folks would think is trivial. This hat was a gift. If it was for me. I would not have worn it. My problem is. The American flag, on the right side. IS ON BACKWARDS. The stars go towards the heart. I have personally refused to wear uniforms for this reason."
3.0,Nice shorts but they are a little baggy in the legs!
3.0,"It looks so nice, but wow the material is so thin and scratchy. I'll use it anyway, but somehow I expected better quality?"
3.0,Not sure they are real but too late now. They keep the sun out of my eyes so mission accomplished. Not sure 80.00+ is worth it but hey. Roll the dice and get burned sometimes.
3.0,Love the is very lightweight and the color<br />But the bifocales are way off
3.0,Exactly what I expected. Cute. I liked it so much I’ve been wearing it daily for a few months now... It’s just now showing some weR.
3.0,I like wearing these when I’m having a night out but to wear 24/7? Not a good idea. Ladies and gents you need real sterling silver and this was just giving me a bad reaction..
3.0,Its an ok shirt
3.0,"Neckline is too big, reaching almost till waist😂😂"
3.0,These are cheap shoes for a cheap price.. no surprise there. But beware... they run BIG
3.0,Kept coming apart
3.0,"It’s very nice, Judy a little itchy"
3.0,Goods ring
3.0,Cute top but too small
3.0,I usually wear a 2XL but this was more like a small XL. Not even close....
3.0,"Super cute, but mine broke after only wearing once. Made me pretty sad."
3.0,The style of the hat is nice. It felt a little tight but it just need to be broken in.
3.0,It’s a beautiful necklace...however it’s so small<br />It’s hard to put on my neck! My 5 year old can actually fit it perfectly. I tried to gently open it more but I’m afraid it’ll ruin it.  Sadly I’ll need to return it :-/
3.0,Great price ! But ran a size small
3.0,Disappointed in this watch band. The glitter doesn’t even show. I looks like a plain clear rubber band.
3.0,"Get atleast 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear. Fits and feels weird around waist. Very compressing around chest so if you're a bustier woman, I do not recommend. Not lightweight at all compared to other grooming clothes. Decent warmth quality for winter but I imagine this would be very hot in summer."
3.0,It was a for a gift. Poorly made.
3.0,"It’s comfortable and stays on my head pretty good and it looks cute but its really cheap and the pink ear part is definitely glued (not sewn) so you have to be careful not to pull on it too hard. I feel like i could’ve purchased it from the dollar tree. I don’t think it was worth $8-9. Luckily it’s only for me to wear when I teach my classes this Halloween. If you’re looking for accessories for an actual costume, this isn’t it"
3.0,"Definitely runs smaller in the hip area than other Amazon items in the same size.  The fabric is ok.  Not as comfortable as it looked in the pictures.  I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy it, but it's far more of a sweatshirt than a ""shirt"" as I thought the pictures showed.  Overall it's ok."
3.0,Cheap zippers difficult to use. Would buy again
3.0,"After my nephew wore these one time a large hole formed in the crotch! This was truly a moment out of the movies; out at the park, running around throwing the frisbee, when oh my goodness! Suddenly he's wearing the weirdest kilt in the land! Great looking pants otherwise, just need better quality control."
3.0,Loved the color<br />Lost the ring for neck already
3.0,Fabric different than expected... little bit shinny
3.0,"They are kind of on the long side, so unless I really shove them up there, they look a little funny.  But it was nice to be able to try a magnetic one to see if I can tolerate it before I commit to a piercing."
3.0,This dress is elegant and fits well. The unfortunate thing is that it is see through. There is no lining at all and I cannot wear this without a full body slip. I am disappointed because nowhere in the description or reviews did I see anything about this. I bought the dress to wear to a Christening.
3.0,Really like the slippers but they shed like crazy. I see pink fuzzys balls everywhere....which is kinda annoying. Not sure if I would buy them again.
3.0,I bought it for comic con in nyc but it kept slipping off.  Not sure if it was my belt or the buckle but I kept having to readjust it which was a major drag.
3.0,It’s ok If you have a thin visor it will work great if you have a thicker visor that has mirrors or lights in it it’s a little difficult for the  clip it’s not made for a thicker visor
3.0,"I'm a size men's 11 1/2 & these socks ran on the smaller side of that. That being said, they are nice & well priced"
3.0,"I ordered a LG/XL and it's somewhat small...I have to really put some muscle into putting it on...Usually, these Asian companies make everything according to the size of women in Asia, not the average woman body in the USA..buy it bigger."
3.0,I actually love the tie. It looked so good!! I am giving a 3 star only because it only came with the tie not the pocket square. I was actually going to use the pocket square as a mask 😷<br />A tie and matching mask but the pocket square was missing!! 🙁
3.0,One size doesn't fit all. I consider myself 34B but VS says 34C. This is tight around me. Pads are horrid so I took them out. I can still wear it but not often
3.0,Shirt was made of cheap thin fabric.  It was cut wide and very short and lost 2 sizes in the wash.  It never looked like picture
3.0,Loved this pattern and neckline so much but it isn’t meant for small chested or small booty women.  You need a good set of hips and C cups to fill out a small.  I am 5’1 and 105 lbs and couldn’t fill it out in all the right places.  Fit my friend like a glove though and she looked fantastic in it and received many compliments when she wore to a bridal shower.  She is short like me but has shapelier thighs and a larger cup size than I do.
3.0,No true size
3.0,Pretty good product. My only complaint is that the holes to insert the bows into is really tight.
3.0,Disappointed because I thought they were cotton material but they are super stretchy material instead
3.0,"They are gorgeous, except they arrived with two of the “same side” earrings, one butterfly facing the wrong way - making them unwearable. You can’t flip the charm around to make it right."
3.0,Not real good for small hands.
3.0,"I found out the fit was too clingy. I did go up a size, but it was too sheer and showcased areas I didn't like."
3.0,Simple wallet for every day. Time will tell how the stitching and clear PVC hold up. Overall a entry level average wallet for front pocket carry or travel.
3.0,It's big but beautiful.
3.0,these earrings look like rosegold but when I got them they look nothing like on amazon looks like more yellow gold than rose...so was disappointed
3.0,Runs small & really flimsy
3.0,"The boots look great, but after gentle wear over a year (only cold spring  & fall months and not everyday), the upper part of the boot detached from the sole at the heel on both boots.  No signs of wear & tear,  just where they came apart...otherwise, they look great.<br />They also run slightly large- I'd say the 7 fits like an 8.  I probably got my $25 worth, but I'm<br /> disappointed they didn't last longer."
3.0,"The product description said “soft stretchy material”. There is NO stretch to this material. Way too small in the arms and no stretch to accommodate for how small it was. Pretty, but didn’t fit."
3.0,I'm going to say that bc my daughter has small feet. She is very petite. But the shoes are cute. They probably could be used as a large dolls shoes.
3.0,"Looks good, but I ended up not using it. It hangs on a horizontal strap, and mine are vertical. In that orientation it's not as useful for me."
3.0,The Peace sign is nice but the necklace broke immediately.
3.0,"The arms holes are huge, will only work as a swimsuit coverup. Such a shame, because it is super cute and so comfortable!"
3.0,Looks nice but not very soft kind of rough on the face
3.0,"Love the shirt, but it runs small. I suggest sizing up one."
3.0,I am 6ft the dress was really short
3.0,I got wide and flat feet..The flip flops are snug and need breaking in...
3.0,"Really nice costume jewelry- however, unfortunately,  the necklaces don't stack as advertised.  The birth flower necklace can not be adjusted in length and the accompanying necklace I put on the first link to shorten length yet they appear to be the same. It's a pretty set, I just won't be wearing them as a pair because it looks odd, to me."
3.0,Don't seem to hold their shape and fit after 3 or 4 washings
3.0,"The width was fine, but it was too short. I couldn't raise my arms without it coming above my waist line. I was uncomfortable with it, but the company let me trade it in on something else which was awesome!"
3.0,"These leggings are very cute. Nice for the summer. The colors are also amazing, but I will be returning for a smaller size. I'm 5'9, 167. I initially ordered the L/XL, but I will be returning them  for the M/L only because I feel that they will be loose-fitting after an entire day's wear based on how it fit when I first tried it on.I prefer a tighter fit when it comes to this style.;-)"
3.0,I was looking forward to using these when climbing and hiking.  They arrived in a great shades box with everything nicely wrapped. I checked out each lense and was thrilled until I tried the glasses on and found out they are very wide. I'm hoping they will fit my husband as they are too big for me.
3.0,"Ordered this, thinking it'd be good for my size, but when I went to try them on, the fabric stretched too easily, distorting the image, the waist band was very thick and constricting. Order a size up, if you can."
3.0,smaller than the image and colors slightly different.
3.0,Material very thin. Should have been a $5 shirt
3.0,Ordered and extra large that should have matched my wife's size. The extra large was a little tight. I would order a bigger size than what you would normally buy. Not a lot of extra room in the hips.
3.0,These shoes were really cute. Lightweight and comfortable for my granddaughter. But they did not hold up. The glitter on the stars started wearing off right away and the Velcro strap came apart.  She has only been wearing them for about six weeks.<br />Material at the toe wore through right away for no reason. I would not recommend these.
3.0,"I would have loved to give this 5 stars but this bra and panty set doesn't deserve it. Where to start??? Lol! First of all, it looks a bit cheap on. The padding in the bra is very stiff even though I washed it a few times, and the panties are small! Now if I didn't have a bubble butt, they'd probably fit nicely. So I don't think that curvy women should purchase this."
3.0,"The sweater does not fall down below (hip/butt area) as long as it looks in the photo. When I put the sweater on It reaches around the belt area. It's a pretty sweater the neck area looks good so, it's okay. the length is the only disappointment."
3.0,"I normally wear a 48B, but I ordered a 50B since so many people thought this was too small. It was a slightly large fit around, but worked since I could hook it to make it smaller. Unfortunately, the cup size was too big for me and I am having to return it. Looks like a good product if I could get it to fit."
3.0,"Cute dress, but poor quality material. Also I'm 5'1 and curvy and it fit me perfectly (length and fit), not sure how much this could stretch to a one size fits all. Would recommend for petites only!"
3.0,"They fit well, love the front and back pockets! My only complaint would be that the material pills up. I sat on a cotton couch and it showed on the black pants in about an hour of wear."
3.0,It’s a nice item if it fit. It runs about 2 sizes small. I’m a medium and I ordered a medium but it looked like it could be an extra small. It has no stretch to it either. I couldn’t even get it up my thighs. They gave me a full refund.
3.0,"The shirt is cute but weird fit...I wear it around the house in the summer, sleep in it & just wear over my bathing suit!! For the price I kept it."
3.0,These worked great for 3 months of working out 5 times a week but now the velcro does not stick anymore.  I mostly used these when I did my cardio and the sweat would pour off after I removed them.  I didn't notice any slimming around my waist which I was hoping for.
3.0,"Got delivered on time, I usually wear cup b but ordered cup c but feels it’s a bit small for me."
3.0,"These fit me, though they are tight near the knee, and the waist band is very loose.  I got the 4x, and I have a 49&#34; waist.  I figure if I try the 3x the waist might be closer to what I need, but the legs would be even tighter.. and therefore unusable... Guess my search continues for the perfect shorts."
3.0,Glove seems small for L/XL and is difficult to get on and off.  It's warm!
3.0,"Bought two of these prior to this pruchase over the past 3 years. This one came out the bag just like the first two, and the fit was identical, but the ends of the sleeves have both started to fray-out after about 5 weeks of wearing it while driving. Disappointed."
3.0,Says it's for a toddler but this hat was huge
3.0,"Construction is very stiff & impossible to put on yourself, you must have someone else clasp it for you, very stiff, not exactly what I was expecting."
3.0,A little small for my daughter.
3.0,What is it with these designers of one-size fits all? Nothing so far from the truth!! I wear kids cap because my head is smaller than the small size baseball cap. And even on my small head it feels too tight; it leaves marks on my forehead after wearing it for a while. That’s my only complaint.
3.0,"These are nice quality but run small<br />However, customer service is outstanding!  Once a larger size is available... will do business with them again!"
3.0,It is a bit large on my frame even though it is supposed to be baggy. I would have sent it back had it not taken a month to get here. It is fine for the price. It is something good to wear out and about during a California day.
3.0,The adhesive backing is very hard to get off the material. It would be better the the backing was cut slightly larger than the material. It wold cut time you spend with it in half or greater.
3.0,"The chain broke first day. My daughters had no idea this was a one direction item.  I just assumed the infinity symbol was a symbol of theirs. They do like the design, however."
3.0,more like a choker than a necklace. still nice. would have loved an extension for this one.
3.0,How it fit my face
3.0,It completed it's intended purpose. Halloween! Inexpensive. I would recommend if you just needed it for a day or 2. But this is obviously fake so turns your skin green.
3.0,Not the nicest feel to hands. Too synthetic.
3.0,"These breeches are okay but nothing special. I commonly have issues with waistbands gapping in back and these breeches  are no better. I was disappointed that the color was very muted, almost a grayish pink. Definitely not burgundy as advertised. EDIT: Not particularly comfortable to ride in compared with my 4-way stretch standard full seat breeches. Hence, I dropped one star to a 3 star rating."
3.0,They were ok! Not sure if they are really blue blocking.
3.0,"Cheaply made, the strip to close hurt my baby, she doesn't like to wear it. not worth for the price"
3.0,Larger than I thought they would be....but pretty
3.0,Good fit but not what I was expecting.
3.0,I really love this dress but unfortunately it's a little big for me at the top. I am a small but when I first ordered it it was only available in a size medium and large and I needed a dress for a last minute event so I purchased the medium. Other than that it's fine. I just wish the small was available when I first ordered it
3.0,They are cute and the quality is what you would expect but I could not wear for more than a minute without terrible ear pain from whatever they are made out of and my apparently sensitive ears.
3.0,Runs small. I’m a petite gal and this fits more like a youth size. Little disappointed.
3.0,"Fast delivery, miniscule CZs, and smaller than one would think.  It was not as appealing as in the picture, kind of insubstantial and tinny-looking, and I returned it.  The return was smooth and issue/postage free, so a star for that alone as returns on a lot of products are very expensive and difficult."
3.0,The length could be just a little longer.
3.0,"Did not fix the snake bracelet,  but they will work maybe on next project. Not today"
3.0,"Smaller than what I expected. I got this for a Christmas gift, and will return if it does not fit the recipient. The quality is nice. Thick and warm."
3.0,Dress definitely made for a tall female. I was walking on the dress . Everywhere else it fit
3.0,"Pretty dress with nice fabric but the dress fits a little big. Since the fabric has no give or stretch, the outfit turns out baggy and ill fitting. Folding the sleeves over my elbows (I have very small arms to start!) like in the photo was very difficult. Still a pretty dress. I added a belt and it was cute."
3.0,"The yellow stitching on this strap perfectly complements the yellow dial of my Speedmaster. Have received a lot of compliments. However, the color bleeds - the strap has turned green and the stitching brownish white. Planning to purchase again as it is a perfect style for my watch."
3.0,"I ordered 5 for my bridemaids and I. Then a few more for various other women who helped with the big day. They are beautiful as long as you have a avergae to small sized wrist. Myonly issue is that that discolor fairly quickly. I go the silver ones and wore it about 2 weeks before it started to change color. Now the inside is a rose gold while the outside is silver. So they were pretty and good for the big day, but now I feel like I gave them a keepsake they cant even use, which is dissapointing."
3.0,Very warm but produce a lot of lint!!!!
3.0,I like the ring as a gagement ring but my main issue it's not sterling silver when it is stamped sterling silver it turns my skin green so be warned anyone who has allergic reaction like I do to fake silver
3.0,"The hats smelled like gasoline (or some other industrial chemical) when they arrived. This made nervous knowing they were &#34;imported&#34;. I tried airing them out for a few days, but that did not help, so I just washed them a few times on gentle cycle, and let them air dry. That made the smell go away. They fit pretty well. Not super warm, so if it is windy, these may not work very well. Quality is ok. For the cheap price, they are about what I expected."
3.0,When you walk around in just the socks they tend to slip off
3.0,The ring beautiful except the part where the MERMAIDS hands come together is very sharp and pointed.
3.0,ok little tite around chest for 3x
3.0,Beautiful boots but very big. I have a pair of Drs that are size 11 but these in an 11 were huge.
3.0,"Looked prettier in the photo, something funny about how the straps look in real life"
3.0,The bag is beautiful but it’s damaged.  On one corner where the strap is it’s not stitched together and the gold metal ring is only on the one side.  I don’t want to return it but it’s damaged.
3.0,"I like the color I picked out, and size is decent.<br />But this is possibly the least comfortable sweatshirt I’ve ever worn.  The fabric is rough and itchy.<br />Obviously you can do better, but i will wear it for this winter then it will go to the bottom of a drawer."
3.0,"I had to take the a pair of needle nose pliers to them because they were really curved and the nose pieces where to far in. But once the alterations were made, they became my favorite pair of glasses!"
3.0,"Nice necklace, but not exactly as the picture. The flowers aren't set right. 😐😐"
3.0,"Eh, tie is odd. Won’t stay on shoulders. Keeps falling down."
3.0,Not exactly like the pictures. . But they look cute in my baby girl ears!
3.0,"I wanted to buy navy bag, that looks good with jeans and with dress. After long choosing I decided to buy this bag.<br />Tho colour is absolutely the same. It was very unpleasant, when I saw crooked stiches, which was made white threads on the exterior part of bag. It seems like somebody used the sewing machine first time."
3.0,"Very comfortable.<br />they havae a nice look to them.<br />However, I've only worn them twice and one of the lights on one shoe doesnt change from green."
3.0,"This don't look anything like the picture shown, so if you're buying for the look, then I would suggest to not waste your money. As far as the fit goes, these were a little slack around my ears & they did gap quite a bit...& I have a pretty big face. I would not buy these again!"
3.0,Received in two weeks exactly. Very cute but a little too big to wear. Only fit my middle finger.
3.0,Good weave but to big fo a female face.
3.0,"I am 5'6 165lbs and a 36C I ordered a Large and it will barely zip around my bust, also one side of the bust coverage is lower than the other one."
3.0,Quite large for a necklace. I guess I should have paid more attention to the size.
3.0,"I normally make my son wear an under shirt under his dress shirt,  but it will be an absolute must with this one. It is thin/see-thru. However,  it's a good fit and it looks nice with slacks."
3.0,"I like the material and look, but it runs way smaller than I expected. I ordered 2-3 sizes up from usual"
3.0,Good looking. Fits kinda big though.
3.0,"Definitely fit on the small size. I would NEVER wear these without shorts over the top. I bought them for a middle school dress-up day and they served their purpose, but fit like leggings for guys.🤪"
3.0,The product shows and describes a rainbow cheetah print but I got an all pink with a touch of purple instead of all the colors which is disappointing.
3.0,Could have been bigger. My hair was exposed around the entire wig.
3.0,I normally wear an XL so i upped the size to a XXL and it was probably the size of a Large. Hated to return beautiful shirt and colors.
3.0,The openings for the legs are huge. These shorts look slightly clown-ish.
3.0,I am making clip earrings for my clients and these are cheaply made. Small and flimsy.
3.0,"Cotton will not only fade, but will shrink"
3.0,I loved this dress. Wore it for a photo shoot And had a blast. It fit great and I had no problem going braless. I love the double slit!
3.0,Comfortable; But some of the threads are broken around the legs and pockets are way to shallow
3.0,"I ordered 2 one black and white, the white one feels more boxy attop, It made me look like a pharmacist."
3.0,"The Silver Tone Baby Feet Dangle is made specifically for a pregnant woman's belly ring hole. It's objective is to be comfortable while the abdomen is enlarging. At first, when I received it, I was thrilled to give it to my 23 year-old-daughter who is about 17 weeks pregnant. While I tried to get her to just take it out and let it close, she did not agree to that idea so this was the next best thing. She was so happy to see the cute little feet. At first when she put it on it felt okay. After about a week of wearing it and she was on the phone to me saying that it always felt as if it was pulling her skin. She felt like her skin was being ripped out were her exact words. We have ordered a few others to see if they are all the same."
3.0,Firs like a loose men’s medium and not a men’s large .  Design is awesome.
3.0,Fits on my pinkie but for most guys it'll be too small. Need more sizes
3.0,"Love this cover up. But it rips easily,both under arms ripped with my first use."
3.0,"A little too small, and the fabric a little lighter than I expected.  Returned it."
3.0,cap very nice and well made but I got broken in the part where the size is adjusted.
3.0,The eye part is pretty and intact but the necklace turn horrible. I bought her a white gold chain and it’s pretty now.
3.0,"They are very nice to look at, they are a bit small but nice"
3.0,"It is made very off, it does not fit nice on the ear, twisting and showing the inside of the earring which is something you do not want to display, believe me. The 3 starts are only for quick shipping. Mine are going back."
3.0,"Love the design of these shorts. The 2 in 1 is the perfect design for walkers, runners, or bikers. All my stuff stayed in my pockets, even with movement. I had to send them back, however, bc they were way smaller than they should have been. The xl pair I bought was more like a very small large."
3.0,I guess it's just my body.. I don't have that Barbie doll shape so off course it looked simply ridiculous over big bones plus those vented things dropped too low for me .. it exposes a bit too much  .. I didn't return it because I figure I can lounge in it or throw a shirt over if I want to step out😛
3.0,"This well-constructed terry robe provides absorbency and warmth, but little ""give"" in the fabric.  Fleshy builds will not be satisfied with this one-size which leaves plus-sizes constrained at the curves.  One might need up to an extra 12 inches beyond the widest body part to accommodate 6 inches of overlap on each panel.  A circumference of 40 inches in the torso would then need 52 inches of ""sweep"".  Wide people may have to pay twice the price for a terry robe that fits since there is no stretch to the fabric."
3.0,"Gorgeous dress, somewhat small but that was expected. Very short, almost too short. The width of the mesh in between the skirt and top looks much longer in the picture, as well as the seams stick out in the mesh, make it look even shorter in the middle. It is obviously supposed to be hidden inside the dress but is not. The seams should be sewed down to one side or the other and are not. They just flap around."
3.0,The band looks and feels great but the middle lock part was coming apart. It was not working properly and so the product is not 100% working well. Wasn’t pleased at all.
3.0,This shirt is alot more fitted than it appears in the photo. It is not baggy at all so if you plan to wear a shirt under it you'll have to go up a size. Pretty decent material for the price as well.
3.0,Not fancy but works well and good for the price.
3.0,"Product was not bad for the money. It looks good .... however, I am 5'7"" 190 pounds and i couldn't even get it over my arms or shoulders to try it on. Also the length isn't correct. It doesn't hang down like a hauberk or long shirt. It reaches my waist. If I was 12 yrs old and about 5' - 5'2"" it might be exactly what I was looking for."
3.0,Semi-sharp edges gets stuck in my dreads very often. I wear mine 24/7 so the paint wore off in about a week or so. But I just repainted it and it's fine.
3.0,"Good fit but not sweatshirt more like tee shirt. Lt brown.<br />Smoke on the balcony, look like an evil monk-ess."
3.0,"This cloth polished some silver items well, however it did not remove tarnish/soil from solid brass furniture drawer handles.  They look exactly the same whereas the knobs cleaned up and polished beautifully with Brass liquid polishes."
3.0,Please note that my previous review was for a different pair of leggings so I made a mistake.  These leggings run small and the material is just ok.
3.0,"It’s a nice watch, however it was described as a small face and it was a large face watch, oh well"
3.0,In all super cute shirt just too small will be returning thankfully they make an easy free return with no hassle!
3.0,Pockets in dress are not flattering.
3.0,Pretty dress but as others said before me--Runs small. I would get 2 sizes bigger to be sure.
3.0,"I want to love these jeans, they fit perfectly...but, the color is a very odd blue and throws the look completely off! It’s disappointing."
3.0,I bought these instead of fabletics brand and I kinda wish I had tried the brand name. They’re fine. They do what they say but they don’t feel magical.
3.0,"Bit costly for the volume, but there are no other additives mixed in. Not bad, but most farm and horse store will carry it for much cheaper."
3.0,Starts to get a little losses after several wears and starts to slip in your hair
3.0,"This is adorable and soft and I am glad they finally make adult sizes in cartoon pajamas but the sizing is weird. I bought Xl and I wear a size 8/10 but Disney is usually very small. The pants were pretty big but wearable and the top was exactly my size, being 36b, the sizing is ridiculous. It is usually the other way around for me.<br /><br />The fabric Is legit fleece, not micro fleece but not plush fleece either.I prefer plush fluffy soft fleece, these are not close to that. However, I cannot wear most micro fleece, I know it immediately, flat and thin with no pile at all, these are.not.microfleece thank goodness.<br /><br />I am keeping them because I am in an eeyore mood sometimes and cannot find plush eeyore pajamas so this is good enough for now."
3.0,"beautiful bag, however a stone was missing from bag on arrival. extremely small bag"
3.0,Too small - returned it!
3.0,Fit nice and was comfortable but bends easy and fogs up. Son didnt like that he couldnt see out of them half way through his day.
3.0,This runs small in the bust area.  Order up a size.
3.0,The band fits well and I liked the original lavender color.  Unfortunately the color is showing wear and got dirty very quick.  I’ve only had it about 4-5 weeks and it’s pretty dirty with normal wear.  No gardening or other messy activities.  See pic.
3.0,This is a decent wallet however the display (as in for ID) is useless bc there is a snap that covers it. It is too big to fit in a pans pocket but is decent leather and otherwise fine.
3.0,"The dress pattern was beautiful; but I was disappointed in the length of the dress. My daughter is 2 1/2 years old; and the 2T came a half inch above her knee...and she’s in the 25% for her height for her age - as in, short for her age! She won’t be able to wear it long, sadly."
3.0,Necklaces are beautiful. They arrived very tangled up and took for ever to untangle.
3.0,"Nicely made, but VERY dainty. Not religious, so I was going to remove the cross and add another charm (a hamsa), but really too small. Will save for my granddaughter, who is being baptized next month."
3.0,bands are too long for small wrist but they are beautiful.
3.0,"I love this dress however there are a couple things that were unexpected: the material is a little thinner than I anticipated and shear, the sleeves are very tight at the ends, so pulling the sleeves up to elbows kind of hurts unless you have small arms, and the front of the dress is shorter than anticipated. I bought this dress to grow with my body during pregnancy, I could wear it until about 30 weeks because the front is too short and no longer covers the goods. I would recommend this dress though. The color is gorgeous, it’s stretchy, just be CAREFUL drying it as it shrinks slightly."
3.0,"Es bonita, pero lo compré para hacer el top del video, pero quedó muy pequeño para eso."
3.0,It is a little boxy and too large for someone who is slim like me. I use an XXS -XS. I do like the print a lot! My sister's keep taking them so I keep ordering one for myself. Am not such a fan of the Hans word on it on this one so though I like the one without it better.
3.0,I'm a 46c and the chest area on the swimsuit was too big but the bottoms were a little tight. I would probably have to buy a smaller size for the top and a larger size for the bottom for the swimsuit to look good. Too bad you can't choose the size of each part.
3.0,I am a consistent size 12; this suit was too large for me. I love the style. The ruffle was a bit wider than I expected.
3.0,They sure are warm but only stop wind to about 40mph. Also stitching is weak had to repair twice.
3.0,"Quality and price are okay, but not for me."
3.0,"a lot smaller than I anticipated, but still cute."
3.0,Ordered a 2xl but a little tight on the thighs.
3.0,Runs extremely small but great quality pants. Ordering bigger recommended. I had to send back and had ordered three pairs. I’m a size 5-7 and an 8 fit more like a 4 on me. That was unusual for me as usually order small for yoga pants and medium for some brands. This brand would require me ordering a large.
3.0,"Pretty, but really heavy..."
3.0,"The style overall is cute, but the fit does run a bit small. My daughter is normally a size small in women’s so I assumed a medium would be a little looser. I was a bit surprised by how small the pants seemed because it looked like they were more like sweatpants. The jacket is made from the same thin material so neither of them really will keep you warm. Even though the fabric can wrinkle easily it does release them pretty fast after just wearing this. The fabric does snag easily, but it doesn't run. I would not advise wearing this for any heavy activity.<br />There is not much decoration on the pants, just the stripes around the ankle to tie the jacket and pants together with a similar color. There are not any pockets or patches on the pants, but the style is pretty cute. The fabric is thin, but not see-through but seams can be seen easily. It is soft but snags easily, I didn’t have any issues with it running after the snag.<br /><br />The color contrast is good, the white is bright, and the brown is solid, but I have not washed it yet to see if the colors run. I wish the jacket had a thicker fabric; this would have made it easier to wear with different pieces. It would work well for an overshirt, but I wouldn’t wear it as a jacket for warmth. The pants are breathable and have a little bit of stretch, so they would be ok for light workouts, but because of their thinness, I would be concerned with too much friction causing holes. The jacket is a bit too long to be a cropped cut for me and too thin to be a real jacket. Aside from the different fit issues and thin fabric, this could be a fun little outfit. I would advise going up a size, though, to be safe."
3.0,"The material the style n look but fit kinda tight on the back heel rub against it but I kept it thought I might break into it been walking around in house but still not what I expect with the rub I love it but wish it was a little more in comfort zone , All I  know can't buy shoes from Azamon"
3.0,"decent shirt, material is a bit strange (maybe polyester) nice with white pants/shorts"
3.0,"These are cute but run small and are tight on your foot, they are more for young girls than women"
3.0,just ok....  the material wasn't what I expected - the color either - but I love the pattern and feel okay when wearing it.
3.0,Ripped in one wear :(
3.0,"I am not one that expects everything for nothing, but the chain broke almost right away. I do like the pendant though and so did my daughter as it ended up in her jewelry box somehow."
3.0,"It came all right, it looked well packaged. However, when I took it out of the plastic it was already broken...I make jewerly as a hobby so I had a spare chain to repair it but I wish that wasn't necessary... I guess it's more of a costume jewerly and not an every day thing."
3.0,"This pants are very thin and the fabric seems cheap.  They were packaged as new, but they must have been previously returned - there was pet hair on them upon opening the package.  I decided not to return them, even with the free return promotion - only to not create an even bigger carbon footprint for the purchase.  Would not recommend, sorry."
3.0,"Have to cut the button in, other than that great for the money"
3.0,These look to be very sturdy and I really like them...... but they are very narrow and look a little strange on my face.  Otherwise they would get 5 stars.
3.0,"Unfortunately I was supposed to get a set of 3, but only received 2. Other than that the product is fine"
3.0,Suit is very cute by short through the torso causing the straps to pull and the slip between the cups to be on your upper abdomen and not your chest.
3.0,Look fabulous but they needed to put effort on the soing and details
3.0,"The top is adorable, and the outfit has great stretch. But it runs WICKED small. Definitely size up."
3.0,"The bracelets are very pretty. However the turquoise one does not feel like real stone or glass, it's clearly plastic. I also broke the cross on the purple one just by dropping it on the floor, so it's not very sturdy."
3.0,"Once again, pictures aren't accurate. I expected this to be a little heavier than it turned out to be. It is, however, indeed gold and the difference is not so great that I feel cheated. An OK purchase."
3.0,The dress itself is cute but the fabric is not soft at all. It is extremely wrinkled. I used a steamer but I couldn’t remove the creases.
3.0,just okay. The neckline fits a little weird so no matter what kind of bar you wear it shows through. I still will keep it to wear around the house
3.0,Beautiful but it came with a broken clasp. So disappointed
3.0,Returned this one. It was a lot heavier fabric than expected. Looked a lot more like a winter night gown than a dress.
3.0,"As stated in other reviews the crotch is way to low (about mid thigh) which causes the pants to hike-up when you get on your bike. I found that removing the liner and wearing very thin long-johns helps a lot. I expected this problem so I can't complain too much. But for the price I am satisfied. They have kept me warm riding in the mid 40's F . If you have unusually short legs, these pants might work out perfectly for you. My inseam is 32 inch and these (pants) are at least 2 to 3 inches too short. One Big Plus is the zipper matches up to my Joe Rocket Ballistic Jacket perfectly. I have since noticed Joe Rocket pants for sale on the internet that look pretty much identical to these pants. I can't wear street pants under mine but I never intended to."
3.0,"The product itself is nice. The material is comfortable and cute. However, the picture shows the sweatshirt going below the hips and over the butt like a longer sweatshirt, which is in style now, but this was much shorter and came right to my hips. That’s the only reason I’m returning. Needs a few more inches at the bottom."
3.0,"I ordered two Size S and one Size XZ, in navy, green, and popsicle print (pink). Though both sizes fit me in the shoulder, the S is slightly roomier overall than the XS. The fabric has a shiny luster even in dim light. I liked these tees based on the pictures but I wasn't sure about the overall shape of the garments. They are quite boxy, and a bit shorter than normal length (normal for me is 23 or 23 1/2 inches from shoulder seam to hem). The shorter length dictates a higher waist pant or short if you want to do a messy tuck - i.e. half in, half out. I generally wear mid-rise pants or shorts and this tee is too short to stay tucked in. Also, the sleeves and hems on these tees are unfinished - just a raw edge. Sometimes a raw edge looks okay on a garment (if the edge curls), but I didn't like the look of the raw edge on this fabric."
3.0,"I have oversized glasses but these are over, oversized glasses.  Not pleasant for round faces.."
3.0,"Although charming, these Fluevogs were quite short in the toe and not at all flattering to my foot."
3.0,"Though the shoes are described as leather in the initial descriptions, read the rest of the text carefully (unlike me!)—this pair of shoes is entirely synthetic."
3.0,"This set is super cute & I love how it looks on. The necklace, however, was not put together very well, so I’m only giving 3 stars. The red stones on the star shape in the center of the choker started coming off & sliding around. Hopefully I can use my hot glue gun or something to fix this & make them more secure. This set looks perfect for my Halloween outfit but I don’t want to lose any jewels. The earrings are great, 5 stars for those. 3 stars for the choker on account of poor craftsmanship."
3.0,"Cute earrings, but lower quality than I had expected. For example, some of the silver coating is not applied evenly/has a small bubble here and there. It does not ruin the look completely, but it does cheapen the overall appearance of the item."
3.0,Ordered this shirt in a XXXL due to all the reviews saying it run small. I’m normally a XL and this shirt couldn’t even zip up on me. It runs like a M instead of the 3XL i ordered.
3.0,Very cheap.  Broke immediately!
3.0,"Bought for my daughter, they are thicker than normal earnings so not for small kids also pretty heavy but cute still"
3.0,I purchased this item as red collar and paid for the right color price but I received a black and instead
3.0,"I have the Yoga Reflex yoga shorts (5 of them so far), and I LOVE them. They fit well, are comfortable, and the fabric is soft and just thick enough, with the perfect amount of stretch. I was hoping that this tank top would be made of the same fabric, but it is not. The fabric on the tank top is thin, and very stretchy, so it is very form-fitting. So I have purchased another brand tank top that I feel is more modest. I feel this just needs a tiny bit more thickness to the fabric."
3.0,Lower quality than I expected.
3.0,"Good material but hard to snap into place once in the piercing...daith piercing are sensitive as it is, so this isn’t helpful. It took the help of two other people to get it placed. It’s super cute though but my piercing is super tender now."
3.0,It was more like a sweatshirt than an actual jersey material
3.0,Not quite as strong as advertised. I think they are more like medium duty .
3.0,Era bonito pero nesecitaba 2 solo llegó 1 por eso lo regrese. Pero no ha llegado mi reembolso aun
3.0,Whoever is making these they need to use real people as models for sizing!!  I love the material and wish it would have fit.  I am a 38-40 around; only C cup ...this bra is nice but runs extremely small.  You have to be small busted to fit in her bras.
3.0,wasnt as strong as i thought it would be screw popped out after few weeks
3.0,"It was a slicker material. Not much give. Comes up<br />Close to your neck so if you get a little anxious when shirts ride up your neck, this one isn’t the one for you."
3.0,The pants are too short from the waist to the crotch.
3.0,I'm 5'10 and these leggings were too short on me. Had to return. These are for shorter girls. The zipper is a little scratchy on the sides when you wear them. Otherwise they are nice.
3.0,I am wearing shrugs more these days but this cropped bolero hangs loosely around my chest/torso and does not promote the style or look that I desire.
3.0,"I ordered an XXL the largest  size available in Coffee. Upon arrival the ffirst thing I noticed was the color, a very light color brown (the picture online shows a very dark color when you select coffe  however the color I received is more like coffee and cream LOL ! Next when I removed the dress from the packaging to inspect it. I noticed the seams were unraveling about the waist on both sides of the dress(see attached pictures). Since I do sew this is not a deal breaker. I decided to try the dress on in spite of the afore mentioned issues. What should have been a comfortable fit in XXL was  more like a med or large very tight. I ordered this dress for a special occasion while it came on time but because of all the problems with the dress I ended up buy another dress, rather than dealing with the hassle of returning it I've decided to shorten the dress and use the extra material in the waist and sides Bust area  to give me more room (as I have a large Bust) and reinforce the seams to combat the unraveling issue. Fortunately I liked the color even though it was not the color I order."
3.0,Even though I love the style they run extremely small and these were for a specific occasion so I was unable to continue with my plans
3.0,Much smaller than expected. Medium fits me in pretty much every other top. Otherwise style and function are fine.
3.0,The bottoms were too tight and the top was way to big!
3.0,"I bought the largest size so it would fit my calves, but there was extra fabric around my ankles and it created a tight crease that was uncomfortable during the day. I kept having to try and work the extra material up my leg, but unfortunately my calves are large enough I couldn't work it all the way up. It kept pooling at my ankles and made deep crease lines in my ankles by the end of the day. HOWEVER the socks are really great quality, super cushy and thick. I'd imagine if they fit my proportions better I'd be extremely happy with them."
3.0,"Nice Boot, but they always come with a defect.  Either the zipper or sole has an issue."
3.0,Looks good but I can't use it I need a 20mm
3.0,Size is smaller
3.0,Love this nose stud it’s dainty. And opal is my birthstone. I would rate a 5 star only if the L was longer since its fallen out a few times already. Was going to purchase other colors and styles from you But will wait and see if suggestions etc are taken into consideration from your buyers
3.0,"Lots of lose strings from hims. I had some difficulty ironing it for some reason. The arms were tight. But it looked good on me, it does look like the pic when delivered."
3.0,"Usually Asian sizes are smaller, in this case, they're bigger. The romper is too loose and wide at the top.  I ended up giving it away."
3.0,"It is very pretty but the material had no give at all.  I am 5'1&#34; and the length was right above my knee, perfect!  I weight 182 and I ordered a large and it is was too small.  For the price and style of the dress, if it fit I would have kept it."
3.0,"Decent fabric, not as much stretch as expected,  the fit isn't exact, runs small at the hips."
3.0,The shirt is short even though I ordered a L. And it smells repulsive yikes
3.0,It was pretty but I lost it almost immediately.
3.0,"The material is quite nice, but the arm wholes were very large.  It is a bit loose for me.  Based on reviewers advice I sized up.  I suppose it would be too short one size smaller.  I also don't love the neck line it is not quite a mock."
3.0,"It arrived about a week late, but its a awesome necklace and I love wearing it!"
3.0,Get a size bigger. Material is very thin
3.0,Fabric is shiny and somewhat stiff at least before washing.  It has short  cap sleeves. I found it while searching “Easter Dresses” and did not notice that the flowers are poinsettias.
3.0,It really is a slim fit. It was too small for me so I gave it to my son. It was tight on him but he liked it that way. It is a quality short made of nice material and the design is very contemporary.
3.0,I did not realize that the XL was actually what would normally be small. I should have looked at the sizing chart before ordering rather than assuming this was a standard XL size.
3.0,"Because these cost a little more than other slippers I've purchased (mainly Isotoner), I guess I expected better quality. Wrong. While new, these slippers felt good on my feet and looked nice. However, within just a couple of weeks, they'd stretched out a bit and now feel a bit loose. Also, the decorative top stitching on one of the slippers started unraveling within the first couple of weeks; I had to tie the &#34;strings&#34; in a knot to stop the unraveling. The soles are decent, but there's already a small gap where the soles attach to the slipper. These slippers really aren't that different than the $10-$12 Isotoner slippers that I usually purchase at one of the big box stores... which means that's what I'll be buying in the future."
3.0,"The Scottie is darling. However, the chain broke after wearing it for 2 days."
3.0,Gorgeous blouse.  Sizing is not accurate (even for China) or wherever it's from.  If the blouse had fit I would have given 5 stars.
3.0,"This dress would be perfect if the pockets weren't so bulky and unflattering. As someone that's only 5' tall and already a little curvy, it was kind of a deal breaker."
3.0,Fit is smaller than I expected and the sequins look misplaced. There is absolutely no stretch to this jumpsuit.
3.0,"Quality is as expected considering the price.  The coat looks OK.  I ordered a medium.  I'm 5'4.5&#34; tall, weigh about 118 lb, and the coat fit my body ok, but the sleeves were too short."
3.0,these are very pretty but one was not connected in the bag.  Tried to fix it but doesn't look exactly same as other one.
3.0,Doesn't fit that well. But I can use it for something else. The dragon itself is cute but not made well for an ear cuff.
3.0,"Nice, smaller then it looked"
3.0,"It's a beautiful dress, especially for the price.  However, it was very wide and boxy, not fitted as it appears in the picture.  If you're handy with a needle and thread then that's not a very big deal.  I took it in on both sides and it fit my daughter nicely.  Some of the appliques were also lifting and strings and threads were hanging everywhere though so I ended up using fabric glue to get them back in place.  It just seemed like I spent a lot of time to make the dress wearable."
3.0,The package came after 2 months and a half but when I contacted the customer service by email they replied quickly and provided me with the tracking number. The material is decent good for spring or early winter when its not too cold. The pink/grey color in the picture is not the same color I recieved I got a red/grey color. And the size fits nicely I got a 3xl.
3.0,I really would love to keep these but the sleeves are short and idk if they’ll shrink.
3.0,"These dresses are not as puffy in person as they seems to be online, even though I also purchased some in larger sizes as well, they are more straighter fit dresses than I expected. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH MORE THAN the $3.99 and $4.99 that I paid, they are so thin and see through, but cute FOR THE PRICE THAT I PAID!!  As I now see the NEW HIGHER PRICE , FOR THIS CHEAP MATERIAL ???"
3.0,"Really pretty top, a little low on the neck line, will have to wear a cami top. Lace is a little cheap, but good for the money."
3.0,"I wear 16 in pants and figured XXL would either be too big or fit just right.<br />Completely the opposite. Couldn't get them up all the way.<br /><br />The material is soft and thin (breathable). It's a little shiny, which I liked. But I'd call these more of a L than an XXL."
3.0,"I have many of these long-sleeve tee shirts.  I have bought several from a high-end retailer, and they all hold up well.  But with Amazon, a few have held up well, but others have not, meaning they wrinkle and stain easily and look pretty tattered after a wash or two.  I can't tell by the markings/labeling which are legitimate, and which look like cheap North Face rip-offs.  They are all the about the same price, so buyer beware."
3.0,"the anklet was very pretty, however at the wedding reception the chain broke, then at the end of the evening the entire clasp came apart."
3.0,These were very light weight and see through not what i expected. Ill still be able to wear them but not with the pants i baught them to wear them with.
3.0,Inferior fabric
3.0,Shor
3.0,"Beautiful dress, it runs slightly large and the fabric has some stretch to it so if you’re between sizes, I’d recommend sizing down. One thing to point out, the image of the dress on the listing is a little misleading. It would appear that the dress is all one color blue with bees throughout, and a flower pattern on the bottom. However, if you look at my photos, the top of the dress is an entirely different shade of blue than the blue fabric on the bottom half of the dress! I would have given five stars had the dress been an exact copy of the image, but it is not."
3.0,"Quality seems decent and it’s very cute, but the cup size is pretty small. I’m 5’ tall and 135lbs and I ordered a medium like I normally do, but I feel like I could have ordered a large this one."
3.0,not as clear as rigid lense
3.0,"I bought these lenses hoping they would go well with my new Oakleys. I got the silver chrome lense and they looked awesome on my jawbreaker frame. The thing is, when you put them on, there is a tint of green and purple that is given off when looking at certain colors while I'm riding on the street. It gives off a 3D effect that makes the road look rather weird. They made me naucious at times. They need to improve the quality of the lense so it doesn't give off weird coloring effects when wearing them."
3.0,"Females mask was metal and cold, it also hurt to wear in spots"
3.0,It's pretty but insanely small for what would be a cover for over a swim suit. It fits tighter than my swimsuit.
3.0,"A little bit big, But good purchase."
3.0,Exactly as shown.  It only took 3 months for the bag to break.<br />I guess being a high school English teacher was too much for the bag to take.<br />It did not hold up to my workload.
3.0,run big
3.0,I bought these for my 5 year old's vans. They were way too big.  I'll be saving them for when her feet get bigger.
3.0,It looks just like the picture which is great but it’s quite bulky and the material is very uncomfortable on your skin.
3.0,"It's not as cute in person, the photos look great but it's super cheap"
3.0,"Few things:<br />-the print is adorable<br />-nobody understand what it says, it seems to be a bad translation<br />-the red from the balloons does bleed a tiny bit, not noticeable though.<br />-the fabric is cheap but after washing it in delicate cycle and steam press it it doesn't feel that stiff<br />-Shoulders are super wide!  I added a few stitches and it looks better.<br />- I ordered M first but the chest is too tight.  L fits better, not perfect.  My bra size is 36C"
3.0,"I had high hopes for these but my underwear show through making them a no for me. Very comfortable but so thin that there was not enough support in the butt area to give me enough confidence to wear anywhere except inside my house. I also ordered the white and can imagine how unflattering these will be, although I could we are under dresses-just don’t think the belly support is there to make it worth keeping. Will be returning."
3.0,"Cute, but very thin and stain easily."
3.0,Inside is very small
3.0,So cute but came a bit dirty
3.0,I like the shoes! Just wanted a better and more durable insert.
3.0,"I actually really loved these!! They were super cute once I pulled them out, had lovely packaging, but my legs are on the thicker side so pulling them up over my knees and getting them to stay was a no-no! They work as mid-rise socks for me but I do wish they were a bit bigger in size!"
3.0,"Although the necklace is beautiful, it is definitely more gold apposed rose gold in person. I got it to match the rest of my accessories for prom"
3.0,Straps are too long
3.0,The material and make of these seems fine but I went by the size chart and they are just way too big for me.  I like my workout clothes to be snug and I have a 34-36 waist so I got these in a XL which they say is a size 33.  That is so not true.  Even with the waist cord pulled tight they are just too loose to be comfortable.  I definitely could have probably used a M.  So for me I cannot recommend based on their sizing chart.
3.0,If you have small watches or leather bands then this is great. But for large bracelets it's too small. It's beautiful though.
3.0,"These are plasticy (maybe resin?) earrings with steel posts and backs.  The scorpion one is the only one I can actually wear, and it looks pretty cool. The spider ones have too much material behind my ear and they look weird.  The horn ones are unlike any other faux gauges I've gotten so far.  Every other one has the post go from back to front (opposite a regular earring) to compensate for the size of them. These don't.  They have an unusually long post that goes from the front to the back and then through back part of the horn, and then it has a screw on ball like a body piercing. And the post is so thick that I can't get it through a regular piercing. The other two have standard posts. I thought this was maybe supposed to be a starter gauge, but the long post is more like a short cartilage bar. Frankly, I'm not sure where they are meant to go."
3.0,"Honestly, the costume was cute, not sure I can say the headband was practical though. It has a wire in it so it was weird to work with. the jacket fit pretty well. The skirt was not my favorite thing, I ended up using a dress I had and paired it with the jacket."
3.0,The blue butterfly clip on earrings are very pretty.  That being said they were very hard for me to put on.  The opening is small and hard to fit on my ear lobes.  I do not have pierced earlobes and screw back clips are my favorite.  Wish they fit my lobes better.
3.0,"First, I paid a lot more for these glasses from Smith directly and am more than a little disappointed to see them sold here for so much less.<br />The best thing these glasses have going for them is they are very lightweight and comfortable to wear. The titanium frame is really good in that regard. After that, things sort of go down hill.<br /><br />These lenses are rated at 16% visible light transmission but I'd put them at more like 20-30% VLT...they are not very dark at all and wholly insufficient for wear in any sort of bright/glare conditions. The lens advertised as green/grey is really more like a light brown. Whatever ChromaPop is supposed to do for visual acuity, it doesn't. I can notice no difference between these lenses and any other polarized sunglasses I've owned. I was also just generally disappointed with the overall fit and finish of these glasses. The nose pieces are hard plastic instead of soft rubber and the lenses are very thin and don't fit well in the frames so they tend to give a distorted image and make the sort of creaky/popping noises that are typical of really cheap sunglasses.<br /><br />In short, if I'd paid $40 for these, I might have been happy with them but any more than that was way too much."
3.0,No support and slightly uncomfortable if doing long amounts of standing.
3.0,Constantly grabbing the bottom of this turtle neck and yanking it back down because it rolls up.
3.0,"Ordered a different color set for my hubby, which he loves, but he wanted more so we ordered these. These are completely different in fit and makeup - the stitching is much tighter and the material is less stretchy. I ended up using them since they seem to fit me way better than him."
3.0,"Everyone said to order up, so I did, but I could have ordered my regular size."
3.0,Looks nice but magnet isn't strong enough. It keeps falling off
3.0,"The arms are extremely tight but the dress fit other than that. Nothing fancy, your typical costume."
3.0,It wasn’t what I expected to small &  not enough excercise symbols
3.0,"This bracelet was more oval than I realized, so I decided to return it. I realize now I prefer the loose fit of circular bangles that slide over my wrist. This is more of my personal preference than anything else. However, it seemed lighter than I expected for a quality gold bracelet. It seems sturdy though."
3.0,"Cheap knockoff product, took me 15-20 minutes per arm to replace the earsocks and that included using dish soap to slide them easier"
3.0,The girls just don't fit. Bra was way to small. On the plus side it came with a pair of panties that fit perfectly. Wasn't expecting those.
3.0,Like the necklace but one earring broke first time I wore it.
3.0,"This product was not what I expected. I did fit but it does not look as elegant as in the photo. The material makes it look a tad bit cheap and the material is very light, I bought the white and you can see every undergarment regardless of the colour. I don't think I will wear it."
3.0,"These earrings are cute, however because they are so light, I've almost lost them both times I've worn them.  There is not enough weight to keep them from sliding out of your earlobe.  If you have to have them, make sure you get those little rubber things that slide on the back posts to prevent them from falling out."
3.0,This wallet is ok.  Needs a magnet to stay closed though.
3.0,"Size runs very small. Vendor should sell this as a 11-12 size, not 12-13. Size aside, this is a quality slipper and nice looking. I do wish it had fit my kid as he did like them."
3.0,Good while it lasted. The slave bracelet fell apart after being warn once.
3.0,I liked the kitty design. The top was great. The bottom was too short. It may have been better of sold with a regular pant instead of shorts for PJs.
3.0,I bought this for after surgery and it doesn't really hold anything in it just smoothes your shape. If you only need to smooth your shape then this will work fine. Definitely not worth the money or buy for me. It also has such slippery material that my pants kept sliding down and my shirt sliding up on top of it.
3.0,They are good but the ones they sent me were a size too small. because of covid19 amazon won't let me return them and replace with the right size
3.0,Followed everyone's advice and got two sizes bigger than I normally wear and I still can't fit my boobies into this sucker. If you are top heavy like me stay awaaaaaay! But if you're shaped like a character from one of those high school anime dramas this bad boy is pretty much made for you.
3.0,"Shorts fit perfect, top a bit too big"
3.0,"Dress does not fit. Chest too large, length much too long. Beautiful, but too expensive to alter. I already paid $25 to ship to me. I can't drop off at Amazon return site. How does company send me ""return label""? I cannot seem to get answers, or way to contact seller. I really need to return and be reimbursed Thank you.<br /><br />Company emailed me and sent return label. I must return at MY cost, after paying $21 to ship to me. Will not order from this site again. Dress does not fit and will cost over $100 to alter. Am retuning it. Lesson Learned.<br />update: April 10,2023. NO REFUND issue. Dress was received by seller March 25, 2023. M&lt;ultiple calls to AMAZON customer service with no resolution, just told to ""wait""."
3.0,This jacket ran small - sold it to a friend.
3.0,It's surprisingly see-through!  So I have to wear a tank top underneath.  Wish I'd caught that when I first received it as I probably would've returned it.
3.0,"Was not really pleased with this costume. It's okay. Made of very cheap plasticky feeling nylon fabric. To me, the tunic isn't long enough. It isn't as long as most club standards. It wasn't the quality of a brown Jedi costume from Amazon that I purchased. That one is poly-cotton. Not this one. This fabric is not soft, and it will need to be taken in quite a bit. Also, it MUST have ties, velcro or snaps added at the front of the tunic to keep it closed. Tabards slip off shoulders very easily and will need velcro or snaps as well. Does not include under tunic. Overall okay for a convention or Halloween, but just did not live up to the previous Jedi. I plan to alter this for a Sith cosplay, so it will look completely different soon. I didn't pay very much for this. If it had been more than $50, I would have been very unhappy."
3.0,Didn’t fit as expected way too small
3.0,Not Flattering. Doesn't hold you in properly.
3.0,nicely  made and have a little stretch to them. The downside of the shorts is they sound like a freakin parachute when you walk. They give off an extremely annoying sound with every inch of movement.  I even wash them with lots of fabric softener but that did not help they still sound like the fabric of a parachute stiff and noisy.
3.0,"Good for the price, nothing special - but you're getting what you pay for here. It fit me as expected, and color is good too"
3.0,When I got them the side arm was bent and a few days later it broke....i fix it I think I will still wear them
3.0,Indoors only more like at home use. See through
3.0,Love this watch for price/purpose I am using it for.  However mine came with some small scratches on the screen.
3.0,"Just got these yesterday and got them out to use today. One had a loose thread hanging out of the handle, straight out of the package! Haven't checked the other yet. They seem sturdy and like they would serve my purpose aside from that. Will likely return. Bummer!"
3.0,"I am extremely pleased with the quality of the costume.  My daughter loves it.  However, we did not get the mouth piece, the hair pin, the pink leg ribbons, or the gold rope belt.  I have had to order a mouth piece separate, but the rest we can make do on our own.  If we would have gotten the whole thing, it would totally be 5 stars."
3.0,"beautiful bag , opening way to small, very hard to get into"
3.0,"It’s a great deal 3 shorts for $20 I like the material because it stretches but, the material is see through. I bought them after reading a few good reviews, some said they weren’t see through so I went with it. I’m a size 12-14 (pant size) so I bought a L which fit pretty good not tight at all but fit just well to where they won’t rise or roll down from my tummy. 3 stars because they are see through"
3.0,"wanted to like them, but did not fit correctly, right foot was tooooo big, they didn't match"
3.0,working fine but it was much bulkier and fatter than I expected.
3.0,I have to buy super glue because it was coming apart out of the package. Otherwise it's fine.
3.0,This would look great. However my noggin is too big. The hat is a great idea but the materials felt cheap or subpar. The velcro did not even meet to touch :-( I can never find a hat to fit. My head circumference is 25&#34; in diameter
3.0,Cute but arrived with one missing stone. I actually wear it 'inside out' and love it that way. It's hard to find jewelry I can wear and like to wear because of allergies. I'd give it five stars except for the missing stone and that I wear it differently than others might.
3.0,"Cute, but be careful not to drop them."
3.0,I’m 5’6 102 pounds 32/30- dd. Hour glass shape. The small was big just about everywhere. I like more tight fitting up top. Wish they made xsmall. If I take the sides in at the chest maybe it will work. With drying. To bad it’s really a cute dress
3.0,I really like it .the size is perfect!
3.0,"So on the product page it states that it fits as expected, it actually runs small, unless the expected fit is for it to be small. I reached out to the seller, however he says I have to contact Amazon, which at this point and time with the pandemic is not an easy thing to do. I purchased these to wear comfortably to the hospital, where my husband is fighting for his life. On that note I guess I'll just have to keep a small pair of leggings"
3.0,"For the price, it' s nice that you get two wallets. I like that it can carry quite a bit of cards and keep a low profile. However, it does not have a very premium feel to the wallet. I've been using it for over two weeks and I also feel that some of the pockets are loosening which may result it cards or cash falling out. At the same time, it does a fair job of being thin and easy to carry around."
3.0,The length is nothing like the picture; not capri length. They are full length.
3.0,Too clingy and small for me. So size up. I didn’t return bc they will be fine under things in the winter.
3.0,Although the glasses met my expectations as far as weight and vision they fell short  as they enlarged/stretched after only wearing a few times. They continually fall off which is annoying.
3.0,"Wish they were the color as pictured. It’s like I only got 2 because the black and dark gray look identical. Well, I can tell a slight difference.<br /><br />I do like the look and fit. I have a tiny wrist and it fits perfectly."
3.0,"This cape is a very nice color and material, however, it is basically just a piece of fabric with a couple of holes cut through it for your arms.<br />There is no hems which was slightly disappointing."
3.0,"Smaller than you think ,not too much sparkle but very pretty and made very well , subtle but makes a statement.<br />I've slept in it and have done dishes wearing it. Its very sturdy for its size. Don't tell your friends where you got it LOL I never do!"
3.0,These are bigger than you’d think. I wear a small/medium so I went with a medium to be safe and they were pretty baggy. I wear a size 7 pant so if your a 5/6 or lower go smaller
3.0,"This material is so small I can clearly see all of my tattoos through it. However, they cover my vagina so they do their job."
3.0,"These jammies are absolutely adorable, they shipped quickly and fit perfectly. But they’re listed as “lightweight” and I would for sure classify them as autumn or winter bottoms. They’re really well made and totally cute, but they’re heavier than i wanted for this time of year."
3.0,They fit smaller then the size labeled.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed with this bag.  I had it less than a month and the zipper broke.  It is hard to understand that since the bag appeared well made.Since it qualified I was able to return the bag.  Still, ​need a work bag how unfortunate."
3.0,"I purchased this item after looking at the size chart, but when received it did not fit.  Even though the jumpsuit is very cute, I ended up returning."
3.0,"My adult daughter's review:<br /><br />I wanted to love these pants. The linen fabric is great, and the soft blue-grey color is perfect. But the fit is just so strange. They are a wide-leg style for sure, but these are clowny, extremely large wide legs. And they are very, very short. I'm 5'7"" and these came to several inches above my ankles in a size large. Because they are so wide, they really need to be a reasonably long length or they become very unflattering. They just make my legs look so short and so big.<br /><br />The waist is quite tight. I usually wear a medium (135 lbs., size 6-8), but I saw other reviewers said these ran small, so I sized up one. I feel like I'm drowning in fabric in the large size, but the waist cuts in a little. It's just a really odd fit all around."
3.0,Nice necklace but had to return it cause it was broke when I got it.. but I have the gold color love it..
3.0,"It's VERY shear, so know you have to wear a slip underneath."
3.0,Good quality but does not fit adult ear for kids
3.0,"All those these were comfortable and appear to be warm for winter, the touchscreen didn’t work.  Returning."
3.0,This was a beautiful dress and fit wonderfully. The issue was that the color was more peach than gold and was totally see thru. With the slit it would have been hard to wear a slip and not worth it to pay to have it fully lined. Maybe a darker color would have worked...
3.0,"I love this shirt.  Comfortable, looks and fits great.  However, it was very expensive.  I got a 2 pack of the exact same shirt for less than I paid for this one shirt."
3.0,Was not satisfied with the purchase
3.0,Too tight and straight.  Cannot breathe and is not tapered at all.  Doesn’t fit 8 year old
3.0,My wife didn't like the way it fit and was hard to get on.
3.0,"I’ve had very nice, high quality Donna Sharp bags in the past, so I decided to order a new one. Obviously, the new one I just received  was made by another company because the inferior quality is a big disappointment for me. I’ll look for another brand the next time I want a handbag."
3.0,"States it comes with 2 batteries but mine only came with one.  On high it only takes about 2 minutes to feel the heat.  The heating element is n the cuff.  Doubt this would fit well on a larger head.  In women's I wear a medium hat.  This is quite snug to my head, so much so I fear the stitching will fail."
3.0,Price-Great. Quantity-Fantastic. Be weary that it may not exactly fit in your button maker. It took a few dozen buttons to realize that the laminate film was a hair larger than my button maker allowed. Buttons would come out with wrinkles on the film. I found I had to tape a stack together and use my machines circular cutter to cut them to shape. Not a hard process but time consuming. Time is money and I think I’ll go with a different brand next time.
3.0,Looks exactly like the picture but runs small.
3.0,"Not as the picture depicted.. I didnt get many doubles of some rings. I mainly got all gold rings and SOME were doubled with a different color. Rings kinda look cheap but they're reasonable, and after a while of having it on, my nose started to burn. So be cautious."
3.0,"The tights are perfect for weekly ballet practice. However, they are not as soft as others on the market."
3.0,I actually ordered the one for a 17&#34; laptop but was sent one for a 15&#34;.  My daughter has a smaller laptop so I gave it to her! So far she loves it!
3.0,"Originally I would give these a 5 star rating. They are comfortable, Sexy, and they are truly a statement piece!! The snaps under the straps make them easy to take on/off. They truly are my favorite pair of heels I own.<br /><br />I have worn them a free times, once through and entire wedding, and they successfully stayed on. The ONLY reason I changed the rating down to a 3 is because the strap broke on me last night, and now I have to figure out how to fix it. It ripped off from the inside  of the shoe. I wouldn't have expected these to fall apart that quickly."
3.0,"Love the top piece, however the bottom portion looks a little cheap...the material and the way it fits. I am considering getting the bottom chopped off and adding a different material to it. Really wouldn't purchase."
3.0,Runs extremely small. Typically wear a small/ 34B and ordered a small in this and had to return.
3.0,I like this shirt. The only thing I don't like is the sides hang low so you're bra shows. :(
3.0,"Unfortunately, while these pants do fit, they’re hard to pull on. The elastic waistband mentioned in the description does not exist. Still deciding if I want to keep them anyway. Not happy about being misled, though!"
3.0,They weren't as big as I expected but they're pretty good. Also here's a picture of them on my dog.
3.0,"Smooth and not rugged/raw like other charara stones own<br /><br />Very small polished stones, about the size of a coin.<br /><br />Can be used as Mancala (game) pieces if you wish<br /><br />All are roughly the same size, but there are some variation<br /><br />Not sure about meditation and therapy purposes, but can see how it can keep you focused when concentrating on fixed objects. Or you can just rub for luck seeing the smooth texture of each stone.<br /><br />Seeing the small size wished they included draw string clinch bag so they don't get lost"
3.0,"Fit everywhere but the chest. Had to return. I wish they offered bigger sizes, because i would have purchased a size up. Nice and breathable, good length, just a bit small in the chest"
3.0,"I am keeping them, thinking about trying to put a dot of glue on the lens."
3.0,Tangles too easily
3.0,"This is okay.  It really doesn't have a good fit for me.  It's a bit large for an x-large.  The material is probably more akin to a heavy t-shirt, but's not bad."
3.0,"Runs at least one size smaller. If you are bigger than xxlarge, don't bother buying this dress."
3.0,I was looking for a bag that would stand up.  this bag does not do that and you can't tell by the pictures.
3.0,I dont like the polyester fabric much
3.0,They are pretty except they didn't come with the purple pair and one of the jewels fell out of one pair when I opened it. Besides that they were good and I wear the rest.
3.0,These are cozy and cute  but in the pic they show close to her knee mines to my calf 😢
3.0,Nice fit. Just a weird texture but it worked perfect for me
3.0,"Very pretty and wouldve worked well for nursing, wish I could have kept it but had to return bc pattern places see-through cream stripe right at middle so my post partum tummy was unflatteringly highlighted and belly button could be seen!"
3.0,"Cute, my daughter loves it, but the quality is not very good. Because the material is super think, they tear pretty quickly along the sides."
3.0,Doesn’t dry very well
3.0,Accidently put in dryer- shrunk a lot.
3.0,"I bought the white sandals  because they were cute and it seemed like every sandal I looked at was over $60, so I thought $40 would be a bargain. But when I got them I felt they were more like $20 shoes, They were a little flimsy and I just have the feeling that they will not last long. As far as comfort I felt like the arch wasn’t high enough and they weren’t comfortable to walk in. There was a big gap between the bottom of my foot to the sandal itself..  They were also very bridal looking, and a little too much bling for my work clothes, but that is just my taste. If they were a different color they would cute for going out.  I gave it three stars because of the price vs the quality and the comfort of the shoe."
3.0,It's a bit larger than I expected. The leather feels very much like plastic. The chains get stuck in a crooked position and are difficult to straighten. I'll be returning it.
3.0,"I love the top, however, if you have hips and butt the short rise to high just a little to revealing for me. I add pants on top and alter the back."
3.0,"this dress is definitely better for a more curvy frame, it looked great on my friend and she even styled it differently but it wasn’t for me"
3.0,Too Tight on a little girl But she liked them
3.0,Much smaller than expected across shoulders and in the front where the opening should meet.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:6bf321bfda76f3444f98c1ec99bdbac9]] Was beautiful for a month or two<br />Wash hands started to turn arm green
3.0,"Pretty, but for me it was too big in the bust and shoulders. I am 5’6, 180 lbs. I am larger on the top than bottom. I wear a 38 DD bra and size 12 pants and skirts. My waist is 35” and I wear a size 30 jeans. I have normal size hips for my weight and size.  This dress fit perfect in the waist but was falling off my shoulders. The color was very pretty and it was made well but overall, I was not impressed. The fabric was so so. I would not reorder."
3.0,"Pretty awesome looking, and the shape fits nicely around the face, however, it’s not comfortable on the ears and nose after a little while. It’s too heavy. Also, the nose piece comes off frequently, though it can be reattached."
3.0,fit is somewhat small.
3.0,They broke easily but other than that pretty good
3.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; and it is surprisingly long (touching the floor).  I ordered a medium and the armholes are not too big as some reviewers suggested.  Maybe there is an inconsistency in the manufacturing of the dress.  You pretty much get what you pay for.  I received many compliments and it's a nice summer dress if you're looking for a casual, beachy type vibe.  Not see through, but it is thin material."
3.0,"It's very light and gives proper protection to the eyes, but the fit wasn't as I expected. It brushes against my eye lashes, so I have to wear it loosely.<br />I guess its okay for the price."
3.0,It is okay for a $10 dollar pair of sunglasses.I was expecting more from it though.
3.0,I did not care for the feel of the leather
3.0,They ran really big and I had to return them. They don’t run in half sizes. I’m disappointed because they are really cute.
3.0,I wore this to a pop culture convention and only lasted about 20 minutes as sweat was literally pouring out of the mask. Really the only air vents are the eyes.
3.0,"Good quality, but fit too large."
3.0,"I think these were supposed to be fitted around the arms, but way too roomy.  Then again, I have skinny arms.  Had to return."
3.0,I wish it wasn't as tight in the arms as it is otherwise I would wear it more often!
3.0,These are really hard to get on and fit too snug.
3.0,Way to small in bust
3.0,"I like the look of this particular bezel, but I’m having issues finding the right size cabochon to use with it."
3.0,"I bought these to embroider and the quality seems decent enough; but they were obviously not made from prewashed fabric. They have straight thin seams, pure white fabric color  and  are not too thick. I followed the instructions on the package for washing (warm water, by hand, lay flat to dry) and even pressed them afterwards with an iron. They look nice- but there was shrinkage; I’m ok with that but they ALL shrunk in the same way- they lost about 1/2 an inch on 1 aside and about an inch to 1.5 inches on the other side of the square. The result is no longer a square hanky, but a rectangle shape that is about an inch or so longer on 1 side than the other. The fabric is still also a bit stiffer than I want to use on my nose, but I’m guessing with a few washes that will soften up nicely. I’m going to toss them in my washer next time and see what happens with the uneven sides & softness (maybe they will self correct?) and will report back."
3.0,"Had a nice oversized fit, but the outside texture was not as smooth/soft as expected and I did not like it."
3.0,I’m satisfied with this purchased
3.0,"The earrings look like the pictures, but I guess I didn’t realize how contrasting the patina and the shiny gold would be in person. Wasn’t a fan. The middle hoop isn’t sealed all the way around unlike the bottom hoop, and my eye kept being drawn to the gap in the hoop. Granted I was also staring at them in the mirror so the average casual observer wouldn’t notice, but it bugged me. I also felt they were quite loud next to my ear. I wore them around for a couple minutes and the sound of the hoops knocking and spinning was distracting. But for someone who loves the look, the earrings were comfortable and lightweight. Also thought the size was nice."
3.0,Cute and fit well but the seams/stitching came loose around the neckline after one wash.
3.0,"Cheap polyester fabric. Too big (5'7&#34;, 105 lbs size small). 3 stars because I gave it to my friend and now she likes me more."
3.0,They are cute but too small and narrow for me. I'm sure they'll work for others but I returned them.
3.0,The seam on the front is super annoying<br />to look at personally. It didnt fit me the best but I am also built like a Kenmore fridge 🤣  still cute
3.0,It's a nice watch but it supposed to be LUMINOUS but that feature is very weak light almost nothing bright.
3.0,"Good jacket. Like the burgundy color, but jacket fit too big."
3.0,These fit well and are a good length/size but the material is extremely thin and see through. We only use them over leotards or under dresses because they show everything.
3.0,I might have a big head but they fit tight and were eventually falling off my face every second from stretching out.
3.0,Great product for the price.  I destroy these fast so I prefer a lower price.  Not amazing quality you get with hundred dollar grow glasses but they do the trick.
3.0,"So just got this today and i have to say im not impressed. Ya its super light and i like the latch system but otherwise its not very low profile. They lost that when they added the extra padding inside and the extra fabric. To say the least im not a fan. Would have been better off ordering a size smaller and taking the extra padding out and wearing a bandana<br /><br />Update-  the more I use it the more I like it. Doesn't  catch the wind like my old one, and you forget  its there"
3.0,Style not as expected. A bit more maternal. Perfect for coverage. Curvy girls approve!
3.0,"Decent dress, I was just not impressed with the colors. They were very dull and washed out; unlike the picture."
3.0,"Its made of that slick, kind of shiny fabric and there was no room for the girls."
3.0,Very comfy but is a dog hair magnet!
3.0,"Didn't like the button that held the hat together and the size was not a fit.  If you got a little head, it will work ok."
3.0,I like the style of the hat . The issue is it’s not purple as shown. It’s more a dull purple or maybe close to a eggplant color.
3.0,The shirt fits great. I'm 5'11 and 290lbs. I ordered the 2X. It's definitely not as breathable as the Columbia or Costa performance shirts. This shirt has a liner on the inside that makes it not breath as well and the others do not. So this shirt would be great during the cooler/winter fishing but I can't recommend for hot Texas summer fishing.
3.0,One of them seem to hurt my foot between the toes. After 5 hours I have to take them off.
3.0,They feel like they are made out of cardboard. I like the designs.
3.0,Well made but must be asain sizing. Way too small.
3.0,"it started crumbling from day one, and the material is plasticy and sweaty.<br />it did look good though."
3.0,These earrings are the absolute cutest!!! Unfortunately we returned because they came broken.
3.0,"These were okay, but they were too small for my face and didn't cover my eyes."
3.0,Love the band but buckle are flimsy lucky I was able to put my own Rolex buckle and the loops broke within 2 weeks of use but I also was able to get sturdy ones
3.0,"Should have fit according to previous experience. Instead, much too small."
3.0,They are lovely but not too comfortable. Cute design.
3.0,"Style is very cute but runs small. And yes, it does smell. I am afraid to wash it, because, it looks like it would fall apart. Will have it dryed cleaned after wearing."
3.0,"The quality feels good, and it looks as advertised.... However I'm normally a small/medium in everything, so I ordered a medium.... And this suit really confuses me. It is SO short in the torso I couldn't get it above my boobs. I'm only 5'2 and have a short torso so I'm honestly not sure who this would fit, maybe a Little Person?"
3.0,"I only gave 3 stars because of the material it is made of. I didnt think it would be heavyweight, but was not as pleased with this. Nothing wrong, they were a little tight so if you border on a bit larger, go for the size bigger. I was afraid to even think about washing them although they are prewashed."
3.0,Loose but short. May be fine for sun protection while driving but otherwise not too effective.
3.0,"The pack has plenty of storage places and options, and worked well, however, the straps on top were too short for my sleeping bag, and the buckles throughout aren't strong enough to withstand a strain. You get what you pay, and this will work fine for a weekend trip."
3.0,I thought the quality and style was excellent. My issue was that it is called unisex and I'm not sure many men could fit it around their wrist. I could not and gave it to my daughter.
3.0,Se hacen feas en la lavada. Muy mala calidad la tela  se hace peluda
3.0,okay for the price.
3.0,Good for one night.
3.0,"There a tight fit. I am a 5’8” 160lb man. On the thin side , these are of normal quality, but very tight fit. I bought 13-15 (way longer then normal)  I like socks long. But still a tight fit. Not much stretch built in. Good price for the product."
3.0,"It doesn’t matter what I do or how I wear this, it spins and lays with the design side against my body. Disappointed."
3.0,I bought these for working out but was disappointed that they fit tight around the thighs. My thighs are average but the shorts were made to fit tight at the bottom of the legs (mid thigh) for me. I returned them.
3.0,"These earrings always irritate my ears after a day of wearing them, so I know they're definitely not hypoallergenic (I have other actual hypoallergenic pairs where this never happens. The black and blue pairs do look quite nice, but the silver ones look super cheap so I never wear them."
3.0,"I love the one shoulder design and less mesh than some other one-shoulder suits. However, the gathered areas are a little odd. They're bulky and loose. I'm a size 14, hourglass shape and 5'7"". This was too long for me and bunchy in the waist. The top looks great but overall it just didn't work out."
3.0,"So I read that these run small, and therefore ordered a 40, whereas I'd normally go with a 39. Glad I sized up, my toes had just the right amount of room. They are surprisingly comfortable, especially the nicely padded insole which actually offers a bit of arch support. I guess it's the knit sock, but they feel nothing like you'd expect plastic shoes to feel, and that's good! That said, they still LOOK like jellies in that they're kind of shiny. That shininess kind of turns me off, it just reminds me of galoshes or something. I'm keeping them because I desperately need some flats that have arch support, but I don't think I'll order more - just not my thing."
3.0,"These are super cute, but I don’t think they are actually 18g. My nose has a 16g in right now, and I couldn’t get this ring in at all."
3.0,Nice watch but the band is to big for my Husband.
3.0,"I was very pleased with the fabric and the overall appearance of this dress.  The sizing is off.  Initially I ordered a Medium, it was too large.  I returned the Medium and ordered a size Small and it was still considerably too big.  I really wanted this dress to work because it is cute and fun.  I am a size 8-10."
3.0,Good vest little bit large for me .I still love this for layering
3.0,Needs more dandelion seeds.
3.0,"It is delicate, I would say flimsy, but in that direction with great lenses performance.<br />I don't see this lasting many years..."
3.0,"Cute shoes and a great concept for water and play shoes. Be careful and look inside the shoe though before sliding it on your little one's foot, as there was a sharp piece of glue that had settled on the bottom inside of the toe. It was a bit stubborn to pull out too. Once that was all cleaned up my sons foot was just to big for it so sadly I can't say they wear well, but wanted to share the rid bit of look inside the shoes first."
3.0,"The color is very off compared to the picture, it looks more like the color of scrubs than the hunter green depicted above. It’s otherwise basically what I was expecting, just disappointed about the color."
3.0,I mainly bought it cause when I walked my dog I needed pants with pockets to hold my phone. To be honest they fit fine and they're comfortable the only issue I have is that the pockets sag when you put any thing in them. So if I have my phone in my pocket you can see my pocket below the pants line. Other than that they're fine
3.0,these are a bit tight but i use them for the pool
3.0,"Everyone is in love with this dress on me. I don't like the front, make me look a bit pregnant."
3.0,Sent back for you could see through
3.0,"These run large, would purchase a size smaller than you normally wear"
3.0,I like the pattern and fit... but the stitching isn't  very good and there was a hole in the butt....
3.0,They look so super fashionable but you couldn’t actually wear them as sunglasses at all. They would have to be far down on the bridge of your nose. Love the color! Just was hoping for something I could look out of without getting a head ache because the lense and frame are so small.
3.0,"The robe was huge in the length of the arms and robe length, too dangerous to walk in unless you were really tall. Had to return it, did not seem too easy to shorten it with the loose weave fabric  not being able to do so without lots of material coming loose."
3.0,"Fit great, but very sheer. Got the pink and grey, have to wear long shirts bc underwear are clearly seen through"
3.0,"I actually loved this coat, the style, the color and the hood. The only issue was the fit. In order to receive customer satisfaction it has to fit as well. I received it for a great discount and I am donating it to someone that can fit it. It is a very well made and fashion forward."
3.0,Gave one to goodwill. Kept the other as trinket.
3.0,Otherwise like the purchase
3.0,"I love the fabric and style, but it's too small for me and I ordered an XL. I typically wear large (size 10/12) and went big on this one for layering. I can't snap it closed over my chest. (40D) And that's without a bra on. Keeping to wear under sweaters, again the material is really nice and the cut is adorable. I would have given this 5 stars if it fit a little better on me."
3.0,"Nice material, just too small. I would go up a size or two."
3.0,"it's just OK, probably I would give it more stars if I had the right size, I bought an XL and it fits my waist but it looks just like regular boring joggers, not that look you are going for. so I would say size up 2 sizes for a proper look, but I'm not sure about the waist then, I'm 230pounds 38waist 5'11 and XL sits Ok on my waist but kindof tight for a proper look on legs. it's meant to be matte, but it doesn't look exactly matte"
3.0,"Literally the cheapest of the cheap. Flimsy, thin, black plastic. But they can look good for occasional use. I ordered two sets and one of the large spiraly ones came cracked. I suggest when you get these to paint them with two coats of whatever color black or dark nailpolish you have then a clear or matte coat to strenghten these and make them last longer than a few uses. They should cost 50 cents per set not $3."
3.0,pretty blouse just not made in USA
3.0,"Its a great product and i truly feel that i have gotten my moneys worth, but i am not a hige fan of how non weather resistant the rain cover is. That was one of the selling points for me and in any bit of rain it seemed to become soaked right away making the cover almost pointless. And i also had to get creative on the straps so they would quit slipping but other than that its a great bag that i use every day."
3.0,"It's cute, I really love the design from the front but the clasp in the back that holds it together doesn't get tight enough for me so it moves throughout the day which is annoying because the pretty side always gets turned around to my inner wrist."
3.0,smaller one came in faded. big one ok thus far.
3.0,Cute dress for swimsuit cover. I cut the straps off.
3.0,"These are the best eye masks I've ever used EXCEPT that they fall apart after a couple of months. They take a bit to get used to, but once you do it's impossible to go back to other eye masks bc these are raised and don't touch your eyes at all. The only problem is that they are not durable :( which stinks. I buy a new pair for my husband and me every few months bc the material in the mask starts to separate..."
3.0,"had to send this back I normally wear XL cause of breast size but I had to re order and get size up and waiting on it now, will give feedback once it arrives ."
3.0,"Fabric has very little stretch. Fit was okay, the waist was fine but they are a bit short and I am only 5'2"". These will not fit length-wise for anyone taller than that. The lack of stretch made these weird when I bend my knees."
3.0,"I order it  because it say it was 65% Cotton, 30% Polyester and 5% spandex.<br />The Label said 80% Polyester and 20% spandex .<br />I give 3 Stars because it fits perfect."
3.0,I like it but it wasn't as I expected to be. Anyways it's good product and has delivered on time.
3.0,The birthstones were not in order with my kids names.
3.0,"Bought this bag January 20, 2017. Really like the way the bag hangs as a crossover bag. Roomy. However, today as I was putting this bag over my head the connecting piece on the side holding the strap broke."
3.0,sort of cheesy
3.0,"The outfit is cute and all but the top does not stretch at all, and it’s quite small… the shorts were perfect"
3.0,"They run smaller, but there still very cute don’t lol anything like the picture but there cute jeans"
3.0,"These have worked well, but after a month, the fabric is starting to fall apart. They are too short for me, even in XXL. I'm six foot tall. My wrists need sunscreen when wearing these."
3.0,Turns color cheap and def not hypoallergenic!! If I wasn’t over the time limit I would have sent back bec I bought 2 sets
3.0,"Unfortunately, this arrived missing some beads and had to be returned."
3.0,Item is really small
3.0,Shows the nips pretty well if you're into that.
3.0,Product was supposed to be a medium. It was more like an XXL
3.0,"I got this for a cosplay, and I have a 13'' neck.. It's HUGE! I'm having to cut this and re-sew the velcro so it fits my neck, otherwise there's like 6in just hanging off it."
3.0,"Cheap looking,  but they were cheap. Good for younger ages, I wouldn't wear as an adult."
3.0,I wore the band daily for about 3 weeks and the connecting pin started popping out.
3.0,Surprised that this was so small. Saw other reviews indicating it ran large. Must be poor quality control. It was shipped in a plastic bag and was smashed and wrinkled. Returned it.
3.0,"The cross have nice details, but I was expecting the cross be bigger in size and thickness."
3.0,Not so flattering on thicker girls. The top part just doesn't look right. The slit is up to high for short girls. It was breathable but just not right for me.
3.0,Too tight and very thin material. Not appropriate for work like expected.
3.0,The fabric was a big flimsy.
3.0,"I received this dress very quickly. Unfortunately, it was way too big and I had to return it. Also, it's a tad shorter in the front then in the back. I'm 5'2 139 pounds, 36B and am muscular. I really wanted it to be to the floor. With a jean jacket and sandals it was cute but so big in the bust area I couldn't have taken off the jacket. It's a bit see through if you are standing in the sun as well. I'm going to order a small from another brand and see if I like it better."
3.0,The stainless steel tribal vine is not as pictured and they are kinda big.
3.0,Fits okay. Seems a little short but pretty lose and wide. This material smells a lot after sweating in it and also chaffes me during runs. 3 stars only because they were so cheap.
3.0,Color is much different than it looks online and jacket is larger than other xl products I have purchased
3.0,Too stiff and fit seemed off... too large
3.0,"cheap feeling fabric, and the front hung way too low, and i am fairly tall- returned. i did like the color ."
3.0,I’m 5’5” 130lbs 32 D fits well however the pads in the top cams wrinkled so had to take them out. Now suit is a bit see-thru.
3.0,Chain broke off  right away<br />Using a safety pin  to close
3.0,The shirt is shorter than it should be.
3.0,Bottoms fitfit as expected but the top seems to run small
3.0,"These are really pretty, but half of them don't work.  Most don't stay closed so they're constantly falling off my bracelet, and half won't even stay closed long enough to wear at all.  I just stopped using them altogether and got better quality clips."
3.0,I really like the earrings and necklace however one of the leaf earrings was larger than the other one- if they both were matching I would have rated item 5
3.0,"Like a couple others have said.. It's kind of loose up top.  I wanted to love them.. they graphics are great and the descriptions is accurate except the top tube part of that sock.. It's loose and thin, not like stance or cycling socks."
3.0,"I like the stretch denim, as it's very comfortable to wear.  The reason it doesn't get five stars is the zipper.  The zipper opening is just too short.  Every time I need to use the toilet, I have to fight to get it out.  It takes a decent product and makes it one I'm not sure if I'll continue to wear.  There are some important aspects I haven't tested yet, like color-fastness and durability as they can't be tested in a short time, but so far my only real issue is the zipper."
3.0,thought it was layered.
3.0,Earrings are pretty well made. The backs they come with aren't very tight that's prolly why they come with backs like that so you have to re-buy the set if lost. Over all ok for the cost
3.0,Zipper broke after 1 week
3.0,"Love the color and very comfortable, it does however run slightly larger than expected. Would probably order another in a different color but in a smaller size."
3.0,"Falta unificación en tamaños<br />de las piezas ... unos chiquitos, otros demasiado grande... hay q agregar más variedad"
3.0,Didn't at all like the inside out look on this sweater. Turned it and it looked like a sweater. Material is cheap. One tiny snag and you have a hole. Very thin. Fit TTS
3.0,Ok but wouldn't buy again
3.0,Unfortunately I measured my head and fell into the range given although on the smaller side of the range. These are TOO BIG  to stay up on me. I was disappointed as I was looking forward to using them and they will not stay up on my face.
3.0,"I bought these for more coverage under a dress. As a full-busted woman, these are flimsy & not supportive. The lace is pretty."
3.0,"Beautifully packaged and included nice accessories. The glasses appear to be well made. They didn't work for me, but the seller has been very responsive and helpful. Excellent customer service."
3.0,"The fit is very small. I wear 4 and ordered up M. Hmmm, they arrived a size 0 or these are tall children sized."
3.0,So I ordered this particular set because I wanted the American flag in my set. But I got several that weren’t in this set and several that are. The sunglasses themselves are great but I wish the mixture would have been the picture advertised.
3.0,Love the material.  Have to belt the top. Pants are perfect.
3.0,"This dress is as pictured, however, if you have a smaller top than the bottom, I recommend sizing down one. Also, the material is a little thin, but not too much. If you're okay with average fabric, it's not too bad. Also, the straps aren't adjustable, so really truly go with whatever you'd wear as a top, regarding overall dress size."
3.0,La tela muy gacha
3.0,"First off, these will never work as ski pants, simply not heavy enough to keep you warm and dry plus pants will never get over boots.<br /><br />Initially, after receiving the pants, I thought they fit great. A nice trim look with enough room for a thermal baselayer for extra warmth. However, this pair had a flawed seam, so had to exchange for exact same pants. The second pair had no flaws and actually looked better. However, the size was not even close. These were looser, a bit longer and overall trim fit looked more sloppy and unkempt. The first pair of pants felt warm and the second pair not so much, I believe it's the looser fit. Pants are not that heavy and I would say for snow pants, they are medium weight at best.<br /><br />If the second pair fit as well as the first pair, I would have kept them. If you find they fit you well, I think for the money, they are worth it..."
3.0,Its cool but overpriced
3.0,"Super see-through and don't size up. Because these are huge. Got the large thinking I would need to size up, but it was way too big.. Medium would've probably been good though. Im 5'5"" 140lbs."
3.0,It's nice just not what I thought it was.
3.0,"Great for the price. Look awesome. But just look cheaper and don't seam hypoallergenic or stainless steel, but I'll have to try them for a while to tell."
3.0,"This is a cute glasses case, but it takes to much time to zip and unzip. We still use it for our son so he has a case in each room to protect his glasses. Just wish it was hinged."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:446878462040fa67b88541270d267adc]] I like the fit except for the arms ( I had to cut them off ) and that it looks like the picture. I got a 3x and I’m a 2x and the fabric isnt stretchy at all. I couldn’t of fit a 2x it fits just right around my chest. It got here much earlier than expected. So that’s nice. I just don’t see a plus size person fitting the arms at all without being uncomfortable.
3.0,"I have a simple belt like this that came with a pair of shorts I bought and I really like it especially for sports where I don't want to wear a dress belt or something.  The problem with that belt is that it is very wide and doesn't fit through most of my belt loops.  So I bought these narrower ones figuring they were so simple, what could go wrong.  Well as it turns out the manufacturer figured out a way.  On each end the fabric is folded back on itself for strength or to prevent fraying, but it's been folded over 3 times!  See pics.  This makes the belt not fit into many of my belt loops because it's too thick instead of too wide.  And frankly it's still a little wide, but that's my fault for not looking for an even narrower one.<br /><br />I have about a 33 inch waist and this belt is waaaay too long, which leaves quite a bit of extra material on the end.  They provide an elastic loop that I could feed the leftover into, but because the belt barely fits through the loops the elastic loop just bunches up and refuses to go through as I put on the belt.  So what I had to do was feed the entire belt through all of the loops, then put the elastic loop onto the other end of the belt moving it into position.  Of course, this can't be done with the belt threaded through the rings, so I have to do this before threading the belt through the rings to lock it into place.  Finally feeding the loose end through the elastic loop.  As a fundamentally lazy person this is just too much work to do putting on a belt.  So instead I took the little elastic piece off and tossed it aside instead pushing the left over back through one of my belt loops which as I mentioned before barely fits.  This is all a bit of a 3rd world problem of course, but I recommend finding a similar belt with a metal end or one that's just sewn very well instead of folded over like this one."
3.0,I bought these glasses for computer and I-phone use. They work well in reducing eye fatigue. The frames arrive in a box with cleaning cloth and a protective bag. However these frames do not sit level on my face. They are too large and slide down to the end of my nose. Not fun.
3.0,"Giving a 3 star because it arrived broken.  The necklace was in a large box and clearly had been tossed around during delivery.  The necklace itself arrived outside of its plastic bag within the box.  I was able to fix it.<br />With that said, the necklace is a little more substantial than I thought the picture depicted.  And the orange color is more consistant with “Tennessee orange” than the picture showed.  So those positives averaged with the negative of a broken product give it a 3-star rating."
3.0,Not cute or trendy.  Maybe it’s bc my feet are a size 10?<br />Could be.<br />Sadly these were returned.
3.0,Cute bathing suit. I think it runs a little big.
3.0,"The ring is very nice, but the mood color changing only lasts for a few weeks before getting spotted"
3.0,I love the fact that it has pockets but me being 5 feet tall it is a very very long and it  just looks like a nightgown on me
3.0,Ring is pretty fits good. But it didnt arrive when i was told it was going to be.
3.0,Nice. Not to big.
3.0,"Good quality. The design is slightly off. I mean this as the back pockets are below my butt cheeks. And they seem to be for people with longer legs as a mediums were long and somewhat baggy . I'm 6,0 ; 200. Even had to cuff the waist for a better length. Color was nice. Material was nice."
3.0,"These shades look just like the picture and are truly very large!! I love a good pair of big sunglasses but these are just a lil extra. I still rock them, but just be warned they are very much oversized."
3.0,It work fine but look funny with huge watch and tiny band.
3.0,Thin terry robe.  Wouldn’t last many washes.  We use it for getting out of hot tub only.  Runs small.
3.0,"They were a little bent up in packing and shipping so not laying flat on the upper edges, which was a big problem.in gnereal, but even more so for me as I bought these to personalize for an event for friends, so needed them to be flat to work with. Well I assumed they'd flatten out in my heat press, and they did frbthe most part and sadly they also melted in the heat press. Yes I've done koozies before and know the proper settings and protection to use on them. So for me these were no good!"
3.0,About the pillow for my husband because the image seem like it was a slightly larger neck opening. However when we got it and opened it it was not even comfortable around my neck it seemed quite small. So we returned it without issue. With that said cushion seemed comfortable and I liked that it had its self storage bag
3.0,Too small but my friend liked it. Nice quality.
3.0,Bad quality it’s like a T-shirt material
3.0,Had to return it too big and doesn't come in half sizes
3.0,I liked the style but it is poorly made with low quality materials. Ribbon frayed. Returned.
3.0,Waistband is tighter than expected.
3.0,"Love it, but I only give this 3 out of 5 because the fabric/elastic is weak so you have to make sure you don't do anything to make the whole top fall off if you are in a posture where gravity can take over, lol I wear this only under other clothing for this reason.  ;)"
3.0,"Good beanie, dope look. My only issue with this beanie is the bottom curls up and looks totally tacky. Other then that I feel like I am in a Motorcycle gang when I have this on! Live life freely! Ascend!"
3.0,Made of poor material. Didn’t realize it was full footie (covers feet) costume. The mask not as breathable. The fingers hard to get into. I would not buy again. Bought gingerbread man and skeleton. Same review for both.
3.0,Love the colors! Bright and shiny and received many compliments! Scratches easily and needs wiped down frequently.
3.0,Product held up to its description
3.0,"Very comfy, fits even my tiny wrists, easy to adjust, doesn’t get in the way when charging.<br />UPDATE: broke after less than a year of regular daily use. The thin plastic that slides into the notches on the Apple Watch to lock it in place snapped. Very disappointed"
3.0,I really love the style and texture of the dress but the dress and the size of it runs way too small from quoted. I hope they could come up with the bigger size soon
3.0,Its super cute but doesn't fit my Samsung gear watch at all.  Wish I had known that before I ordered it.
3.0,Not for me. It looks and fits as the picture shows but the material seems low quality and itchy.
3.0,I recieved this last week.Easy to size right. One can leave it longer to accept IWB holsters or tighten the belt for OWB.
3.0,"I’m pregnant so decided to order a size up. I’m not really loving how it looks, I think it would be great if I didn’t have my pregnancy belly."
3.0,"Lovely material, fit perfectly,  210 lbs, short and sexy, didn't ride up when I walked, must wear a thongs as panty line will show."
3.0,IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS FOR A PENDANT I WOULD HAVE NOT BOUGHT THESE STONES. BUT ITS OK
3.0,the length of this shirts was kind of bit too long for 5.2 height person
3.0,"I’m 5’ and usually size 2-4. I saw that most reviews said to size up, but being slightly skeptical I ordered a 4 in turquoise and a 6 in the pink. The turquoise was not really the color shade I expected (I expected a bit more green).  The size 4 ran true to size, but was shorter than expected. The pink was pretty baggy and weirdly wide on the bottom. I wanted to love these, as the material is what I expected and the fit of the size 4 was *mostly* what I wanted (just wish it was a little longer AND the right color). I’ll probably be exchanging these for the correct size and color."
3.0,"Great UGG leather quality. They came in a plastic bag, sealed, with all tags on.<br />Unfortunately, after a few uses, the thread on the right thumb came loose, exposing the finger inside. I was kinda disappointed about that.<br />I don’t think I would recommend it.."
3.0,The material was not what I excepted
3.0,Thin material and runs small. Overall a cute shirt tho..
3.0,"It's alright. It's what you pay for. Cheap metal. The rhinestone look cheap too, and the other details is a string  wrapped around the necklace. It's cool for what I paid."
3.0,These are okay.  The tummy control works well but they fit a little weird through the rear-end.  They seem to run a little large rather than a tight stretchy fit.
3.0,Not as comfortable as expected. Pocket for cell phone worked but other pockets were inconvenient.
3.0,Synthetic knit cap. Comes a bit loose or &#34;one size never fits all&#34;. A bit overpriced at $16/ea.
3.0,"Cute, but definitely is short in length. I would recommend ordering a size up."
3.0,"This is a very cute, comfortable shift dress but beware of shrinkage. I machine washed and hung dry the dress and it shrunk over three inches in length and is smaller/tighter now. I’m considering buying a new one now that I know it can only be hand washed in cold water to prevent extreme shrinkage."
3.0,"a little shorter than expected, and I&#34;m only about 5'4&#34; but still nice"
3.0,Nice for inexpensive jewerly.  Good length.
3.0,"Meh. Not sure if I'm going to keep this one. The bottom sides just suddenly take a tip up at the very ends and it runs small. I like the material though and since I'm on a roll loosing weight, I know it's fit better in just a few weeks but it's most definately overpriced for both the look and fit."
3.0,"The bracelet is pretty, but the description doesn't say how long it is.  When it arrived, I tried it on, and it's too long.  Even when clasped, it falls off my hand.  I would guess it's about 8"" long, which is fine if you have a bigger wrist.  They should add the length to the description so you know what you're getting."
3.0,Ok but not what I expexy
3.0,"Needed some sunglasses for throwing around in the car and in my purse.<br />Many sunglasses are too narrow at the temple or near the ear and end up giving me a headache. These are nice and wider for my bigger head.<br />Not durable, but if you are easy on your shades then these are a bargain."
3.0,It's a cute skirt but thin and the material is not a very good quality.
3.0,Super small. Size is more like 0-3 months.
3.0,"The look and feel are great; however, you will need to wash frequently if you work out a few times a week."
3.0,hard to take on and off  Diamond scratches nose
3.0,The product is like the picture except the pieces came off easily.
3.0,This product had a defect not sure if was a actual defect from factory or could have been in shipping non the less the factory gave us a fast refund would use this company again!
3.0,"I got the black size 12. Pros and cons are listed below.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-it is real jean material, I hate when I order one of these jeans and it’s more leggings than anything else. So the material is a pretty good jean quality.<br />-it’s a good length, not short but not too long. You can wear heels with it and they hit the floor.<br />-it looks really good on<br /><br />Cons:<br />-definitely not high waisted, or not high waisted enough. I would say it more mid rise than actually high waisted, I wasn’t too happy about that.<br />-not a lot of stretch and not entirely true to size since I’m a true size 12 but the top part is kind of uncomfortable kind of fit. Not necessarily right but just a weird fit.<br /><br />I read most reviews that said it’s not high waisted and I wish I would have listened because I really wanted high waist. But I’ll keep them since they look nice otherwise."
3.0,This is a true wrap dress- in the fact that you wrap it yourself. My chest isn’t quite big enough to make this flattering.
3.0,"Fit tighter than expected even after consulting the manufacturers sizing recommendation. Padding moved around and was positioned strangely. Returned. Fabric did feel comfortable, but not enough to keep this."
3.0,"It was huge for my nose. Maybe just not the right body jewelry for me but it was pretty disappointing. I even bought the smaller gauge 16mm for a smaller ring in general. It's super cute though! So I can't vote either positive or negative. Just, meh."
3.0,"I loved everything about this hat. It is warm and the visor helps on those sunny winter days. BUT it has an overwhelming, obnoxious perfumy smell. I'll try to cold wash it in a lingerie bag and air dry. Otherwise it it unwearable."
3.0,Size runs a full size small
3.0,"It’s a little bit large, to loose."
3.0,had trouble fastening it
3.0,"I ordered this because I like this brand of skirts, and I wanted a good yellow for spring/summer. This came quickly, but the color is not the canary/classic yellow pictured, but more of a mustard/school bus yellow. I am picky with yellow, so I returned this. I forgot to take a picture of the color, but I assure you, it's mustard."
3.0,Love the look but the frames are more narrow than my nose and the material is a cheaper hard plastic. Seems like they’d melt in high temps but great for the price. #DivaShades
3.0,"thin silk-like material I thought it was a regular thick winter sweatsuit, the top was xxs, and pants fit fine."
3.0,"UPDATE: Took a star off bc I finally went to wear them after a month in my closet, realized there were light streaks all over them. Seems like a dye issue. They washed great but streaks remained.<br /><br />I ordered both the black and brown pair in XS- the black was loose on my 28in waist, the brown is snug on it. The brown color is not the pumpkin-toned pants the pictures suggest, they’re just brown, but I still like them. Material is sturdy and nice!"
3.0,Runs very small. I returned it. Not made for large bust.
3.0,"deberían ser mas largos , lamentablemente ya no me da tiempo de devolverlos"
3.0,Color is great.  Style not so great but works well with a summer suit.
3.0,I took a size 7 in another style of the same brand and it fit perfectly.  This one is at least one size smaller.  Going to exchange for larger size.
3.0,"I use this as a slipper, it was a little tight around the top and sides where the toes are but has since stretched out to be comfortable. Quite honestly I would not buy them again as feel they are over priced."
3.0,"too big. I followed the chart and read comments to determine size, but it is way too big on me"
3.0,"the material wasn't what I expected, it wasn't soft so I sent it back"
3.0,Looks cool. Thats about it.
3.0,Nice dress but wrong color is supposed to be a purple  beautiful dress
3.0,"The stone is stunning!! The 3 stars is bc the the finish on the band started to become just from the band sitting next to it. It also had hammer marks from the molding stage near the head of the stone so it wasn’t completely smooth. I wanted to keep it, but the band was just too much for me. Absolutely stunning stone though!!"
3.0,"It's smart looking. The clasp is very hard to open.  For a very tiny wrist and if you add charms/beads, it will be even tighter on the wrist."
3.0,"Now I know why they sell three in a pack. They do not last. I was delighted to give these goggles a 5-star rating when I first purchased and used them, I thought they were the best ever.  They were comfortable and did not let the water in, nor did they leave a mark on my nose. I swim laps three times a week. I took careful care of the goggles.  After about a month they began to leak and try as I might no adjusting worked. I am very disappointed. I expect to get one year's use minimum not one month."
3.0,"Narrow neckline and almost too much fabric in the swing of the dress which makes it very boxy looking. I love this style and wear dresses similar to this, but I was not overly impressed with this one."
3.0,"I got these for my ears - the cartilage, the conch. I found these to be very hard put on especially in the conch - inner part of the ear. I could not twist these on for the life of me. I had to use a thin plier twist it on. This might just be a personal problem and with the size of the earring its expected.<br />Overall I have been wearing them ever since I managed to put them on and haven't experienced any color change in the gold tone or irritation.<br />The prong set stone is a little lacking in sparkle though, Its actually hard to see it when its on the ear. The gold tone balls are probably my favorite of the set.<br />Not sure I would buy these again, Maybe next time I will get a larger size?<br />Although if you are using this for a lip piercing or on the ear lobe these are very cute and delicate, and probably very easy to put on!"
3.0,"beautiful color and pattern.  However, I thought it was more of a scarf that could be wrapped several different ways like a skirt or shaped differently. unfortunately, it can only be worn as a coverall. with the one style."
3.0,"The top coating wore off much sooner than expected.  Other than that, the belt is fine."
3.0,The clasp is different than what I am used too the &#34;dip&#34; is in the part that goes through your ear and hurt when I put them in. They do look very nice though. Ok for the price.
3.0,This were adorable on my son.
3.0,I love the fabric and color of them.  They are very comfortable around the stomach if you are thick like me.  That being said they offer no stomach compression.  My only hate/love on these capris is they are not tight enough to stay around your calfs.  If you have big muscler calfs then this will ride up and gather around your knees.  The love part is I love that they are not so tight around the calf they become painful.  2xl fits comfortably on me I have a small waist and big hips/butt.
3.0,Quality is average.Not thick more lightwear sweater.I usually wear sweaters in large.But I ordered up to xxl.Color came as shown.Overall satisified with purchase for the price.
3.0,Very fun but a lot of work to tie and use for an apron-especially if in a hurry.
3.0,"Genuine leather. Prefer Full gain or top grain leather for my belts since it's more durable.<br /><br />Belt is too smooth, feels like there's too much plastic coating on the exterior<br /><br />Buckle is silver colored instead of black like in the stock photos.<br /><br />Buckle is large. Stands out well<br /><br />Holes are large. Less likely to stretch, deform overtime<br /><br />Has a lot of stitching around the buckle<br /><br />If like other genuine leather belts, may last 6 months before you start seeing wear-and-tear. But with the multi stitching around the buckle and large whole for inserts, may last a bit longer"
3.0,"Love the concept of terry sliders but it’s so hard to walk in these. Guess they’ll be bedroom slippers, somewhere I don’t have many steps to take."
3.0,"These are lovely and fun, but way too long for my feet (size 7 1/2)."
3.0,It's beautiful and great quality. It's just much bigger than I expected..sorta thick. Makes it so my fingers can't be next to eachother..a bit uncomfortable. But the accent ring with it is great very comfortable and I have a couple other rings I can wear with it.
3.0,"Was looking forward to wearing to a party. Dress was too tight around the bottom, making it difficult to walk. I usually wear 8/10 or medium. Ordered the medium and it easily ran at least 2 sizes smaller. Also, the one shoulder fold at the top of the dress was twisted and had 2 spots under the flap. The material was good quality, not thin at all. The red color has a slight orange tone. Was expecting more of a deep red."
3.0,"Needs a cord to tighten or loosen the gaiters.They are light and breathable,but for winter you would need a heavier fabric."
3.0,Normally wear a large but wish I had ordered XL.
3.0,"The material was okay, but the shape was off. My son is 3 and these were not only too small, but the depth of the space between the fingers was irregular. Of your child has smaller hands these might be okay. There is also a lot of packaging if that matters to you. Each pair is individually wrapped which seems a little excessive."
3.0,"I was excited to receive this bikini and try it on to see how it looked before this summer, however sadly it runs a good size or two smaller than I expected. It does appear to be made very well and of high quality however."
3.0,"These sunglass are so fragile<br />After 3 months, they broke"
3.0,Seam pulled out in the front but it is a cute dress
3.0,The bracelet is cute and durable.
3.0,Fall off easily.
3.0,Love these earring but they already broke! Too fragile :-(
3.0,"Love these just wish the red and pink were gray and black! Wear the brown, tan & blue a lot!"
3.0,"Have not used the watch band yet because the  tools that are needed to remove links wasn’t included, wish that would have been mentioned before purchase."
3.0,"Wow, excellent quality, but way, way, way too small! Super disappointed with that!"
3.0,Do not machine wash/dry... or you will have a flowy t-shirt as I do now..... :/
3.0,"This is one of the prettiest, soft and expensive looking and feeling sweaters I've ever bought, too bad it was so very small.  I also accidentally ordered 2 by mistake.  I read the reviews and sized up to med, but it was so very tight, no way I could have worn it. I'm 5'5, 110 , 38c if this can help someone else with sizing. I usually wear an xsmall and I purchased a medium. Ihope my exchange fits better.  This was my first time ordering Pattys' beautiful line.  I will replace it.  It's really very beautiful on. Figure flattering. Love the cuffs, long but won't get dirty like with thumb holes. This was a great idea especially if you use hand cream most of the day. I hate not giving 5 stars, but it's only because of the sizing up.  Beautiful on.!!This is a beautiful sweater on and will be warm for the winters here in VA."
3.0,"I bought it for a dance marathon that was 12 hrs, and it held up okay, but threads were coming out frequently. Not good for long term, but I don't think many people would get it for frequent wear. As expected."
3.0,My son liked the design but it's small.  X-Large tops are usually a little loose on him but this is tight.  He still wears it and it's not uncomfortable but a little larger would have been better.
3.0,"Kinda cheap quality. Sound is decent just feela like if my son plays with it, he will end up breaking it."
3.0,Looks great but broke after one wear
3.0,"The item was received as ordered, though the pictures looked better than the actual dress.  For the little amount of money I paid, it looked pretty good.  I just washed it for the first time and it did start to fray at one shoulder and another seam.  It should probably be washed by itself on gentle maybe even in a bag for dedicates. For the price it was a good buy!"
3.0,"I am about 5'6 with short legs for my height but these pants are a bit short on me when I wear them at a mid-waist height. Other than that, I really like them. The material is very soft and comfortable and the pattern is very cute. With these &#34;one-size-fits-most&#34; clothing items, it's difficult to get a perfect fit. These pants are comparable to an American size small that is a little short if you want to wear them at mid to high waist, but if you wear them low on your hips, length shouldn't be as much of an issue."
3.0,"While the band works well and looks nice, I am having to constantly having to readjust the band. It seems like a tight fit when you put it on (as the magnet seems very strong) but I find I have to readjust it many times throughout the day as it is always slowly loosening. It feels better than the original band, as I don't feel like my wrist is sweaty while wearing it. It does, however, pull at the hair on my arm (despite having almost none). So I like how it looks and the fact it is very flexible in it's sizing, I will probably be switching back to the original band the fit2 came with."
3.0,This was surprisingly poor quality as I use other UA products and been satisfied. The fit wasn’t good (too small) the design also wasn’t great. All this at a premium price points makes it a downer! Returned it.
3.0,Pretty dress but its see through and the sizing is off by 2 sizes and everytime you put it on it makes a ripping sound. The pockets stay poked out.
3.0,Product was cute. Size runs small.
3.0,"Love G shock , but this particular model is not easy to read time especially when it is bright outside"
3.0,"A bit see through, little to no stretch. Better off with a forever 21 dress."
3.0,Cute pattern but looks faded. Hard to tell what the patterns are and close up seems blurry.
3.0,"Got a couple for work. Ok, I guess. Starting to fall apart a little after hard weekly use. Would get again."
3.0,"As cute as this bracelt is, I'm really not impressed with it. For starters, it's pretty stiff feeling. Secondly, it's not the best quality (one of the white ropes came with a red stain on it!). And third, the picture makes it look like it will constantly display all the adornments, but it doesn't; they are constantly overlapping and you can usually only see one or two of the three."
3.0,Very disappointed. When I put the nose ring in it stayed in but only for 5 minutes tops ! :(
3.0,"They were ok in the beginning, but after a couple of washes and drys the socks shrunk and I can't wear them without them popping off my heel every time I get up to walk."
3.0,"Really wanted a nice white shirt. The cut on this one is nice, the material is soft. Per the seller size chart a medium would  have had plenty of room but I ordered a Large to make sure. The measurements on the Seller Size chart are way off. The Large I received was closer to a Small of XS. I normally take a woman's size medium and order items listed at 37-39 on seller charts. The large on this seller's chart shows as more than 42 which should have been oversized for me. Also the White color is see through."
3.0,These were really cute at field day buttttttt they shed the fuzzy bits all over the areas where they are worn. So after removing them my son had a red line of fuzz on his skin.
3.0,Not very supportive without the straps. Disappointed.
3.0,This item was misleading online. It didn't say it was boys. I entered men's Wwe gifts and this came up. I also entered men's swim shorts and this came up.
3.0,"Lovely but very small, it is a pity they are not a bit bigger. I am going to keep them in case I have to make a nice gift to a young lady."
3.0,Adorable but hook broke fairly quickly on 3 of the 5.
3.0,Shirt looked great until I washed it and it shrunk to size l from xxl.
3.0,"I actually returned these bc although they are cute, they are very heavy and clunky. They are hard and don't flex. My daughter would not have been able to play comfortably in these."
3.0,didn't fit as expected
3.0,"Bought this as a gift, super cute. I have 3 stars because the quality was pretty low. The pictures are a bit deceiving, the moon is really just a marble with a sticker in the middle. Still cute though!"
3.0,This is a very cute set of necklaces. The charms are very shiny. The charms were thicker than I expected but I felt that made them look more authentic. My daughter is very excited to share these with her best friend. I told her in the 80s these were all the rage!! (That almost spoiled it for her  lol) My complaint would be the chains. They are not really that nice looking. They appear pretty low quality. That's why I'm giving only 3 stars. The charms are great but I'll be buying nicer necklace chains for them. Overall not bad for the price for two young girls to share. I received this product at a discount for my honest review.
3.0,Returned them. Excellent experience when returning.
3.0,It was good for what I paid for.
3.0,Nicely made. Size chart with this item is way off. I wear a women's 16-18. This fit my daughter that wears a size 10-12. I even ordered it bigger than I thought I needed to be safe.
3.0,This sweater is shaped oddly. It’s extremely short but substantially wide. It’s like a belly shirt that is extra width. Do not dry or it will pill. The fabric gets tiny BB’s all over it and the sticker will melt. Wash cold (gentle) and line dry! Overall I’d recommend another -reductive. It was definitely not worth the wait.
3.0,"I bought this for hot yoga, and the white one gets a little sheer if you sweat a lot"
3.0,Shirt is a velvet material and runs small
3.0,"These underwear don't have a pouch for the man parts ,but keep you cool though the clothes and feel comfortable."
3.0,"I really liked this top but had to return it because it was too small. The fit was not made for someone with big boobs. It wasn’t see through and it was a pretty thick and soft material. i’m 5’9, 165 pounds. i’m a 34 C cup and normally wear a large in most sports bras"
3.0,"Pretty good for the price, kinda big"
3.0,The beige was more of a light neon yellow. Kept it anyway because it was comfortable...but definitely not beige at all.
3.0,"I couldn't tell from the picture or description just how long this shirt is. It's more like tunic length, and there's a lot of material on top as well. Just didn't fit me."
3.0,There is no stretch to this. Other than that is is comfy. I ordered xl so it would be a little baggy. It isn’t too big so it runs a little small.
3.0,"Pros: pretty, medium-weight, very stylish<br />Cons: Broke before I could wear it- it was a simple gap in one of the rings and easy to fix, but still disappointing as I couldn't wear it on my trip- but I""ll enjoy it as soon as I can fix it.  Comes as pictured and is very pretty!"
3.0,"This top/dress was okay. It didn't fit as I expected. It was clingier than shown on the model. It was also much too short for me to wear as a dress. I had packed it for vacation and thankfully I had bottoms to wear with it. If I had tried it on before washing it, I would have likely returned it."
3.0,Nice waymtch for the price
3.0,Not a good fit for a medium size. Once you adjust the Velcro on the back it bends the front as it’s made for bigger size
3.0,"It looks beautiful but it's defintely made cheap. Also its a little smaller than I expected. I take very good care of my things, so it should hold up just fine. 👍🏼"
3.0,"I received my item on time but very disappointed with the size, this is why I'm only giving 3 Stars. This was supposed to be loose but it's tight and I usually wear large shirt but purchased the x-large to wear with Jegging Jeans. On the other hand it's still very pretty and will make a great gift for my niece."
3.0,"floral 3 does not look like the photo on the model.  collar is higher as another reviewer mentioned in the white version, not a nice open v neck like the photo.  Material is heavier crinkly rayon, not soft light weight.<br />Threads hanging out and hems cheaply done.  Needed very light weight blouse for hot days and this feels uncomfortable on, with the quality of the material and the high neck.  Not flattering either, with really no waistline. Sending back unfortunately."
3.0,MATERIAL WAS GOOD --I ORDERED AN XL TOO SMALL FOR ME
3.0,Its a weird fit. The length looks nothing like the picture shows. The material and print is nice though
3.0,Pretty color but fit looser than expected and fabric was flimsy.
3.0,I used to buy my dresses medium but this is too large at least for my waist. :( but the material is good.
3.0,I really love the style of these earrings but they are far too big.  They also feel a little too plastic for me.
3.0,The item fits me well wasn't to small and is a comfortable fit.
3.0,"Bought to use only one a photo shoot for my 5 year old. He did look cute in them. However, I opened the package and literally one of the clips fell apart and broke. Although I figured out a way to make it work, I probably wouldn’t buy again. It wasn’t the worst set ever, since it was priced well and he was only wearing for an hour."
3.0,It's okay but rings should be larger these were more for young teen girls or even younger not mature full grown women.
3.0,"Bigger than I expected and very light weight. I like the fact that my cell phone actually fits in the side pockets, even with my battery case on it!!!"
3.0,"Not as cute on as in the picture.  Definitely runs smaller than normal sizing.  The colors are pretty, however."
3.0,"These were recommended for travel during Covid.  While they are relatively attractive, the sides are fairly open on the sides.  They might give adequate protection as work glasses, but i would not recommend them for protection from Covid on airplanes."
3.0,The black wore off after maybe 6 months and the clasp progressively got weaker.
3.0,Umbrella has a flaw.  It’s difficult to open and close. Have to do several times before it works. Love the concept of the umbrella.
3.0,Poor quality shoe that cute little pink edging on the side of toe part comes off and hangs I had to E6000 it up...still is loose!!! The stitching on the front part of shoe is supper stringy ...she is in need of another pair of shoes!! Bummer because they are supper cute
3.0,the bottom was good but the top runs way too small
3.0,"For a full grown adult, this may measure a bit small in terms of fitting.  It is unfortunate that it is made in only one size."
3.0,"They are cute, definitely cheaply made- but you get what you pay for! The thing I can't quite get over is how heavy they are. I wear A LOT of statement earrings and these are next level."
3.0,"Good product and what it says your getting , is what you get . the only negative is that dreadlocks were sewn skew ..... but all very happy with it"
3.0,"The chain is short, and the &#34;telescope&#34; is more magnifying glass. Which is cool and fine with me, I picked this up as a steampunk cosplay accessory. However, a couple pulls collapsing and extending the telescope broke the front piece off. Superglue seems to work, but when I buy a thing, I don't intend to have to make immediate repairs"
3.0,This jacket is really cute..very light weight only for show don't try wearing it when it's cold out alone. You will Freeze
3.0,Loosens up far too easily for all day use. Very beautiful but doesn’t stay on.
3.0,The color is beautiful but around the rear area it has no elastic to keep its shape. Cheaply made.
3.0,Really pretty bag but it was way to large for me
3.0,I was disappointed with the size and the quality. They look like they are made of plastic. I was going to return them but I was able to make use of them after all.
3.0,"Esperaba por el precio q pague , mejor calidad en el oroducto"
3.0,I had to take it to my tailor to shorten the top sleeve was too lose around the breast and arm area. But I like the short. Nice quality and soft.
3.0,"I love the look of this ring but the size is off, I ordered an 8, this is a 7.5. It's too small for where I wanted to wear it a d too big for my other finger."
3.0,I did not like the material or the color.
3.0,Great buy....
3.0,The colors look nothing like the pictures. They basically are an ugly brown.  I think the photos are very misleading as if these are colored glasses when in fact you have to hold them up to the light at a certain angle in order to see any bit of any color. They are brown and slightly small for the face. They are no better than dollar store readers.
3.0,"These shoes ran wayyy smaller than expected. I gave them to a friend who wears half a size smaller, still too small. Also, the soles have 0 traction. I slipped quite a few times on hard wood floor."
3.0,"Shoulders have a little poof to them that I wasn't a fan of.  Seemed to be well made, beautiful fabric.  I just didn't like how it looked on me, so I returned it."
3.0,"Love these, however my black shirt had a small piece of fabric hanging loose at the stomach line, went to remove it and the shirt now has about a 2 inch snag. Other than that, these are great."
3.0,"Let’s start with the good: material is like leather (soft and nice), brings extra backs and hook as spare parts (see picture), good size and boxed well even for a gift. The and: I didn’t like the complete mismatch of pattern between one earring and the other, I wasn’t expecting them to be exact but I don’t like the drastic change in pattern...would recommend whoever is packing the earrings to try to keep the pairs somehow similar."
3.0,"The colors of these were more muted than they looked in the pictures. Fabric was soft and nice, but I am 5'5 35-25-34, 115 lbs, and these did not compress at all.<br /><br />Supposedly an XS should be too small, and S should fit, but no way. Not unless they were mis-sized. Defeated the purpose. Sent them back."
3.0,"Loved it but it fits a bit too short on the front, not a fan of the fabric but once you put it on, it looks awesome!"
3.0,I love the color and style. The big problem is the cups in the top ... very uncomfortable and give an odd shape.
3.0,Good but not that much
3.0,Package was soft pack and squished out of box. Luckily they were not broken! Glasses belong in box shipping. Glasses themselves are nice.
3.0,Nice hat... the brim is very wide and dramatic.
3.0,The earrings look closer to purple than black
3.0,I like this shirt but it is not one of my favorites as the style is less versatile. It has a bohemian/earthy look to it. The material breathes well and also does not wrinkle easily so it is a nice choice when I want to dress up a bit with less effort. If this is your vibe this is a good shirt to add to your wardrobe.
3.0,"The material is great for Summer use. The legs are cut wide, and meant for thicker thighs, unless you like a baggy fit.<br />I returned them because the size L looked clownish on me. The waist fit as expected."
3.0,"love the color , however it was way to big as I am only 5'1 . Would recommend ordering a size smaller then what you usually wear ."
3.0,"Took a long time to ship. Material feels pretty strong, not as soft as I was expecting. The color is a little off. More like navy blue and white instead of black but all together not bad for the price."
3.0,"For me this was way too long in my nose. It kept hitting the bone on the inside of my nose and it constantly moved where it looked like I always had a “bat in the cave”. It also bothered me in my sleep so I just ended up getting a different nose ring from elsewhere. The stone was not too large & it did shimmer in the light,but like I said the part that goes in your nose was way too long for me."
3.0,Too small even though I bought a large size for my child. He's not a big kid but it's still small on his face. Guess I should have gotten teenage size.
3.0,"These are larger than I anticipated, and I typically wear oversized sunglasses.  The sides extending to your ears are very long and don't grip the side of my head very well. They are also a bit heavy, but otherwise I would recommend them.  The lenses seem very clear and sharp."
3.0,"Super cute, but SUPER SMALL. Had to give them to our 5 year old..."
3.0,Nice slipper and made well. Pretty color. I wear size 9 so had to order the 9-10. It stretches out a bit so is not as snug as I would like
3.0,"Not the greatest quality fabric and craftsmanship, but it's a decent where around the house kind of shirt."
3.0,"I had to return this product. I bought it for work, but it would not be appropriate.  It fit like a body con. It was bathing suit thin material also. I don't think going up a size would help. It just seemed to be the way it is made. It was already past my knees as well."
3.0,"OK, can't resist chiming in.  Mass is scalar and velocity is a vector.  Both mass and velocity can be time dependent, irrespective of whether they are a scalar or vector quantity.  The classic example of a variable mass problem is a rocket, that burns fuel as it accelerates.  Differentiation of the momentum when both mass and velocity vary with time is through the product rule of (ordinary) differentiation.  d/dt(mV) = mdot*v + m*vdot.  Sorry for being pedantic, but I'm a real life Mechanical Engineering professor who has taught this class several times...<br /><br />There is another issue here.  The meaning here is ""may the result of the forces be with you,"" rather than ""may the force be with you!""  ;-)"
3.0,Not as expected. Not sure if he will like the embroidered look. It’s for a gift. We will see. Not what I was expecting at all
3.0,"Was on the smaller side.  I went to wear it for the first time and the straps are already ripping.  Not a huge deal, I can just sew them, but you definitely get what you pay for here."
3.0,"I'm 5,5 and I think I'm a tad too tall its like thanksgiving down there"
3.0,Design rather good.Leather quality leaves a lot to be desired.
3.0,These are GIANT! And my husband laughed. So now off to making one into a necklace. I really hate to return these bc they are pretty and I do love red 🤣😀
3.0,Scratches all over it and the sizing of the letters don't match the image advertised.
3.0,It’s a pretty dress but runs to big
3.0,"Would fit a child, but not a teenager or young adult - way too small. Cute graphics."
3.0,"It is a shame that the stitching on the straps is so poor!  I will have to hand stitch them all to reinforce. One strap seam came completely undone in first wash. Otherwise they are wonderful camisoles!  Fit beautifully, the shelf bra is supportive, the fabric feels great and did not roll up. A little extra length which is perfect for me! If it wasn't such a hassle I would return them all and ask for a set with secure straps, but it seems quicker to just sew them up."
3.0,Sizing runs way to small.<br />My granddaughter usually wears a adult medium. I went all the way to xl and they were to small
3.0,It could have been nice but fitting on top is weird especially witht the adjustable strap is somewhat crooked. Does not feel right.
3.0,Much boxier cut than expected but was good enough for what was needed.
3.0,"The pants fit pretty good, but when I washed them, the color ran out.<br />And now the pants have blue splotches all around. They also shrank 1 size.<br />So if you buy these, plan to hand wash and hang dry for sure."
3.0,"I am 5’4 and 130, and I thought the medium was a little big. The sage was a pretty color but I thought with the style of dress, it kind of looked like a hospital gown. I may try the pink instead."
3.0,The dress was cheaply made not st all as I was expected I never return it seem like too much bro lemme to return
3.0,The ties are nice but the colors shown on the set of assorted colors is not what I received. Maybe it’s explaon d in the description that you will receive randomnassorted colors. I will buy again hopefully it’s different ties when I order a different set.
3.0,First impression loved these boxers. First great didn't slide down or anything like that. Compared awesomely to under armour. Until I wore the grey pair. The pair that somehow was a size smaller than the black and the red pairs. Only knock I've got is they aren't the same
3.0,Does not work for large chest
3.0,"When the are in they look more like triangles than hearts, but still pretty."
3.0,Not for big hips
3.0,Would have giveb it full five stars.. its larger than expected.. almost like a long chain which usually one wears with a maxi dress. I had not read the description. I thought would be small as a pendant. But its very prettty
3.0,"It’s not a sweatshirt, it’s a thin sweater. Color is nice and it’s soft just very thin."
3.0,I am between a 32/34D and ordered a medium after reading reviews. Definitely need a large. The band does not even touch my skin and I was spilling out. It's a cute bathing suit but it just doesn't fit. And I'm not sure a large will be small enough for my rib cage.
3.0,"Fits nice with stretch, looks professional. Only downside: does pill after many washes."
3.0,Really pretty dress for a little girl and fit as expected but the glitter was everywhere and still finding glitter months later. Returned it before the event and found another dress
3.0,"Such a cute concept but the stitching is poor, the slipper on the right does not look like the one on the left. Poor quality control."
3.0,"I ordered a large, out of the bag it looked like a small, I guess I needed an xxl, that's not good"
3.0,Husband didn't like feel of material which was on the crinkle side of not too comfy; returned for refund.
3.0,Smaller than expected in that it fits but the green inset is not a larger part of the dress but rather just as fitted as the rest of the dress.
3.0,"It is a nice mask.  Only downfall is that it is huge!  Like for a man's face.  I am going to see if I can fix it.  It would be nice is they made different sizes to choose from, like Small, Medium and Large.  This is on the Large size."
3.0,"Although it was comfortable and cute, the tassels fell off the first time I wore it and it was hard to put on by myself."
3.0,"These earrings are fine for the price+shipping (you must include shipping because it doesn't really cost ~$7 to ship them) but they look a lot different than the picture. The black of the stone isn't nearly as shiny or dark as the picture and neither is the posts. It is real sterling silver but it doesn't have the glossy black enamel look as the picture does. These earrings also look quite a bit smaller and more delicate and dainty than in the picture. I originally got these for my brother in law but I realized once I had them that they might not be all that great of a gift for him (I'm really not trying to sound stereotypical here). I'll keep them for myself and I don't mind them, they look fine alongside a pair of small diamonds (or diamond look alike's)."
3.0,It makes your hips look wide the way it is cut. I won't be wearing it out of the house.
3.0,"This was a cute dress, just not for me. I think it would look great on a really tall person. At 5'4&#34; in height and &#34;on the slightly thinner side of average&#34;<br />weight, I felt the bell sleeves just overpowered me, and I didn't realize just how much they flared. To be on trend with this style, I need a more modified flare. Also, the green color was not a vibrant as I had hoped. Sizing runs a bit small, imho, so size up unless you really like a club fit. Otherwise, it's well made and very reasonably priced. I love this brand and will buy from them again. Sorry I have to return this style, but I will shop for something else in their collection to replace it."
3.0,"This night gown would be pretty, it came so wrinkled it was hard to tell what it was. Also came in a Ziploc bag with a tag that says new."
3.0,"I wanted a watch that showed the date/time at night not realizing that you had to press the button to do so. Whatever. Not a deal breaker. But adjusting the time/date was crazy--very touchy and not intuitive. Most watches I've dealt with have several stops, especially when a day and a date are involved, but not this watch. You have to cycle through a full 12-24 hours to change things, never knowing if you are am or pm until the next day when the date hasn't changed...ugh...annoying.<br /><br />I think it's a good starter watch for a teen, but that's about it. Very basic."
3.0,Love the look.  But the fit was a little bit to small.  I have a lot of hips an bottom.
3.0,"Nice vest and color.  However, it is not worth the price I paid for it.  Somewhat cheap material and zipper."
3.0,Wasn't  what Was selected.
3.0,"This was a gift for my husband that arrived a little later than the expected delivery date. The response time from the seller was quick and was very friendly. However, the material of the shirt was thinner than expected and the size/fitting was off. My husband joked about being one of those “bros” that wears super tight fitted tees. If that’s your flavor, order your usual size. If not, try ordering a size up- because now we have this awesome tee that doesn’t fit. 😪"
3.0,fit okay just had some hand prints on them
3.0,Up close I think this set does look a little cheap but it'll still look great on my wedding day. I don't wear jewelry often and didn't want to spend a lot of money on wedding day jewelry I know I won't wear again. I think this is perfect and goes great with me lace dress.
3.0,The chain was nice except it kept twisting on me during the day and made it uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,"It's okay, but sort of fussy and easily moved around on my glasses."
3.0,It's shrinking after a few washes
3.0,Love the size but the gold trim on the sides are coming off.
3.0,"The top is really cute, I ordered a size up because I like my sleepwear big and comfy. Not a fan of the shorts, the fit seemed off. Would purchase the top again separately if I could"
3.0,Fits good. Love the color... BUT ONLY 2 VERY SMALL POCKETS
3.0,Was so excited for this top and washed in cold gentle cycle upon arrival.  Hung to dry and guess what?  It now fits my 12 year niece.  If it shrank that much on first quick wash I don't see how buying even plus sizes will last getting wet from your swim suit and drying in the sun.
3.0,This mask was huge on my 9 year old. It actually fits my face better Than hers
3.0,nice design fit my girlfriend a little small
3.0,Cute print. Color is more purple versus burgundy. Sleeves are sewn rolled up which I didn't realize. Neck is a little oddly loose. It's cute enough and I'll keep it. Haven't washed it so can't comment on that.
3.0,Liked the color and feel. But they were see through and very small. Ordered a size 4/6 and the the crotch came to my daughters knees. They fit my 2yr old instead of my 5yr old.
3.0,I was disappointed with this product. Material looked cheap.<br /><br />Even after I ironed it it still didn’t quite look good.<br /><br />Would not purchase this item again.
3.0,"Well made and decent cap. However, I wouldn’t describe it as “heavy” twill.  More like medium."
3.0,It breaks easy
3.0,Necklace is pretty but very hesitant to give this gift WITHOUT authenticity certificate.
3.0,"Other brands at similar price point are far superior.  These are soft, but tight along all of the seams.... which means unavoidable camel toe.  The length is normal, but the sizing otherwise runs a bit snug (M feel like a S).<br />Stitched tag, vs printed onto fabric.  Lastly, black is definitely a brown-black.<br />Three stars for softness and coverage, but I wouldn't buy these again or recommend them."
3.0,"This does look like the picture for the most part I just didn't like the material at all, it felt super cheap."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful but there were two major drawbacks for me.<br />1. The dress fit literally everywhere BUT the chest and I purposely ordered this item a couple sizes larger to be safe based on prior reviews. I'm a 36-DD. I wouldn't think that's too uncommon when ordering the largest size possible in a dress<br />2. The appliqués are not sewn on as securely as I would have liked. Rather than be sewn at the bottom of the appliqué, they're sewn about half an inch in all the way around, which makes the edges of the appliqué stand up and generally look sloppy.<br /><br />I have to alter the dress anyway to fit my chest, so it doesn't bother me to fix the appliqués while I'm at it. For the price, the minor cost of fixing it still works out cheaper than a designer version in which everything is perfect"
3.0,"I'm typically a 34D and ordered a large. While the cups fit perfect, the band caused overhang and therefore, it will not be worn. If this was offered with a band that had a clasp to choose how tight or loose you wanted it, it would be the PERFECT everyday comfortable bra. Super disappointed."
3.0,"Update: The seller did replace the item, but that one also broke quickly.<br /><br />It lasted a week before the chain broke and the little clasp fell off. I can't swap out the chain because the pendant doesn't fit over the end and I have a very dissapointed daughter. My only option is to find a jeweler that can fix it. I was with her when it broke and it literally just fell off her neck while we were shopping. I'm only giving this 2 stars because my daughter loved the charm."
3.0,cute charm but chain is way too small!
3.0,Ok dress socks. The solid designs are fine. The patterned socks are super small and have no stretch to them that I can't even get them on my foot. My 12 year old tried putting the patterned socks as well and they don't fit her they have to be child size sock.
3.0,Great design but very small. I bought it for a comfortable pajama/around the house shirt but it’s tight. The women’s large looks more like a children’s large
3.0,"While these shoes are adorable, with their twinkly light ups and bright styling, they do not bend. I'm giving only three stars, not because they aren't cute, as they are the cutest thing I've ever seen. The thing about these light up Skechers, twinkle toes, is that they are like army boots on the bottom, no bend at all. These are for a toddler. I wouldn't put these on my granddaughter unless she wasn't walking yet. Then I would for sure let her wear them and watch the lights!"
3.0,Love everything that I bought at Amazon.. Thank you.
3.0,"I've received what I expected for this price. My only complain that after first wash fabric shrunk despite that I used gentle cycle and cold water, and now it is shorter and no so baggy as I wanted."
3.0,this is a really short scarf.  I wish it was longer
3.0,"The colors are true to the picture, but the hair bands were a little big for my daughter. She is 9-months-old and they just didn't stay on as well as I'd hope. They aren't huge, but hopefully they will stay better over the next couple of months."
3.0,THE SKIRT IS CUTE.
3.0,Cute shorts but I really dislike the fabric. It’s synthetic feeling and itchy. They also seem to run pretty big. They are really long on me but I can roll up the waist band.
3.0,"Picture shows a jacket that is slim and fitted looking, but i got a loose and someone large version of the adevertized pic."
3.0,"I had to buy an extra large for this robe to fit (I wear a size 12 normally).  I purchased this robe because I was looking for a light weight robe to pack when I travel.  This robe fit that purpose - it is light weight, and it will not take up a lot of room in my suitcase so it will serve it's purpose for a while anyway.  That said, it was not expensive and it is cheaply made.  I washed it before getting ready to use it and it &#34;had&#34; to be ironed, it does not resist wrinkles.  I will travel with it as long as it lasts, which I don't expect will be for a long time, fortunately, I didn't pay a lot for the robe"
3.0,I like the idea but the hoop is very large and kept snagging on my hair.
3.0,"Although cute, it’s of course expectedly cheap fabric. That’s not the issue. The top is the issue. It’s made with a long band and the band has no way to adjust it. It’s unwearable as it just hangs. Shorts are ok though."
3.0,The blouse ran small. Pretty though.
3.0,"The material of some of the colors is pretty stiff, and the edges are sewn kind of cheaply - there's some loose thread. But they work as bandanas, so I guess that's what counts."
3.0,"Just got bag today, have to admit if I had seen it in a store for this price I would have walked right past.  Its huge, I mean I could put several days changes of clothes, a pair of shoes, a lap top and other things and still have room.  Its a patient leather and it appears to be supper sturdy.  The design is growing on me. Not in love with it yet but not ready to send back either. Have it hanging in my home office so I can see it. I'm starting to think it might be good for work as I'm in outside sales this be used as a brief case.  Will get back to you on it."
3.0,"Irritated my girlfriend's ears, I think she's allergic to the material. Still a good deal for the money though."
3.0,I like the rache but the belt buckle doesn't lack too well some time it comes off from the belt.
3.0,"I really liked the unique look, however, with several uses they became tarnished and discolored."
3.0,They are adorable and comfortable but I wouldn't say they are pants for winter. They are very silky and thin.
3.0,"Hard to assemble.  Somewhat lighter, but not bad for what they are."
3.0,Not Long enough...I am 6.4. The seller Should have given more infos on the length...
3.0,"It's a super beautiful top but a bit baggy on me, I normally wear a small in tops with a 34B bust and I ordered a small and it was still too big, I'm too lazy to return but I'd order a size down."
3.0,"Beautiful however not true to size at all it says one size however is definitely wearable for the occasion it is a black panther, wakanda what kind of birthday party so it will be one with black and white top and black leggings so I will be able to get away with it but it does not close so if you are a full figured woman,I wear a 20/22 ordered the largest size, this will be smaller however quality of vitamins grade I'm still going to rock it along with my accessories that will be okay."
3.0,"Cool design, and I like the somewhat but not really mismatched style. The only complaint is the the colors really start to fade when stretched. So much so that they look worn even when they're brand new. Otherwise, cool product. I would recommend the stitched Stance sock over the screen printed ones."
3.0,"Strange fit. I thought I had gauged the size correctly based on other reviewer comments, but no such luck. I am 5'1&#34;, and a 38B. I ordered the XL, and this dress barely came to mid-thigh and was too snug! The waistline was about midway between empire and regular waist, and hugely unflattering on me given the short length of the dress.... That being said, the fabric was thicker and nicer than I was expecting, and the garment appeared to be well-made. (However, I returned it.)"
3.0,Nice bag but does have a bad odor.  Hopefully airing it out will help as I like it and don't want to have to return it.
3.0,It’s well made but the elastic straps are thick especially with the adjusters when you wear glasses it’s entirely too bulky and hurts your ears😏. I’m sad because it’s so cute!
3.0,Not a bad product for the price
3.0,"It's a nice dress, however, I'd say the LARGE size is would better be classified as a medium that runs on the small size.  I can often wear a medium and usually a large, but this dress doesn't even come close to fitting me.  PLUS they don't pay for shipping on returns.  :-(  Honestly, I don't feel this should be listed as a Large at all.  I can't possibly wear it and I have to pay to return it.  Not happy."
3.0,"I bought this for my wife who is a tall. I asked first about the fit and was told this would fit a tall. (I'd delete that question.) Hopefully a tall size will be offered in the future.<br /><br />Though I liked the dress and the way it looked in general, the waist was too high to fit right. But would like to add that the sleeves were a good length and so many times that is a problem with fit. So that all averages out for 3 stars."
3.0,Be ready for your booty to be hanging out.
3.0,"Cute dress but sized large. Go with a size smaller,  Maybe 2 sizes smaller"
3.0,"I love these sunglasses, they are incredibly cute. Just not what I was expecting for myself. Very lightweight, extremely see through glass part. Overall love them, just not for me.<br />And as always, delivered on time"
3.0,"This dress, while beautiful, was completely sheer when I put it on. I returned it because I was going to wear it to a family wedding weekend but I didn’t want to worry about how sheer or see thru the dress would be."
3.0,Very cute dress! Button holes are made of cheap elastic material that make it look like my boobs are busting out of the top- will try to sew instead. Overall cute dress and okay material
3.0,I loved it but it was so big on me I had to sadly return sadly but I'm going to order a large .its bigger so remember that and stretchy I love lived it just have to reorder right size for.
3.0,"Order a bigger size. I had to return mine because they were incredibly tight on my hands. I am usually right between a men's medium and large in gloves and the Large here is undersized. I returned them and that was very easy to do. I bought other gloves (same style, better fit)."
3.0,"The material is ok, kind of comfit, but too large size. Color looks ok."
3.0,Doesn't fit in my ear but it looks pretty cool. I wish it was just a little smaller
3.0,"They do reduce glare somewhat, but do not improve visibility as I had hoped. I wanted them for dark rainy nights to reduce glare and improve visibility when everything looks jet black due to the rain. They also took forever to get here. Probably because they were shipped from China."
3.0,"The wife here.  I like what it does for my hips, but the torso is noticeably short (which I am already pretty short at 5'4&#34;) which results in some not very flattering effects in the chest region.  It doesn't work for me, but it might for some other body type.  Consider getting a size larger."
3.0,My husband loved the belt but the second time he wore it the buckle assembly jammed and he could not remove the belt without breaking the assembly. Can we get a replacement buckle?
3.0,"These gripping socks worked well during most of my Barre and Pilates class, but would work far better during a series of bridge poses if the grippers continued up through the toes.<br /><br />The socks are on the thin side, but will be great during warmer months. There’s a tab on the back of the ankle so they won’t slip off your feet.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and didn’t fade after two washings on a warm setting (air dried)."
3.0,I loved how warm these tights were. My daughter used it to keep her legs warm under her Halloween costume. I was hoping she could also use them when wearing dresses in the fall and winter. But the foot/toe area is as thin as regular tights and they tore after less than 2 months.
3.0,It's to short. I w have to have it lengthened. Also having a yellow slip made. The bottom is see through.
3.0,Great fit love the color. Only thing the style was nice until I notice the bottom part of this DRESS I hated that attachment. Waited to long to return it.
3.0,It's a bit shorter than expected. Not the best quality but cute.
3.0,"Super cute,  fits well.... but quality is a little sketchy. When i received it,  one of the black bottom pieces was not attached. I super glued it, and it's stayed on just fine.  I love that i can still find dangle earrings even with gauged lobes."
3.0,"It was actually very cute on, I liked the cut and the colors, it fit nicely. I returned it as the material is a heavy polyester and I was concerned that it would be very hot to wear in warm weather."
3.0,"I was not impressed with the dress when I initially tried it on.  The second time I tried it on, I think a small dress would look better on me versus the medium because I am short.  I'm not sure if I will exchange it for a size down.  I was also expecting a denim blue instead of a light blue dress.  From a distance, the dress could pass for a denim dress though.  I will admit that the fabric is nice and light; perfect for a hot summer day.  The quality of stitching is poor.  There are loose strings all over.  One string is very visible on the arm of the hand I'm holding my camera with.  Fortunately, these strings can be snipped and a person can carry on with life.  Overall, it's a decent summer dress."
3.0,Quality is great. Shipping was great. The color is not as described. It is more of a yellow then a green.
3.0,The set is beautiful but the sizing runs small and the set does not fit. Consistently an extra-large fits.
3.0,These are mostly cotton briefs that fit well and are comfortable.  They can be machine washed and dried.
3.0,Arrived in great condition put necklace in broken right away not doing anything but try to put it on.
3.0,"The band fits comfortably and has the 925 sterling silver stamp. However, the stones do not sparkle and make the ring look dull. Also within the first week of receiving this ring, one of the stones fell out (see pic)."
3.0,"I loved these pants purchased a 14 and its was too big.  I am 5'8"" 170lbs.  I returned and got a 12 and it was still too big.  I ended up returning.  I like the style but it was not for me."
3.0,Pretty but very small.  Returning.
3.0,I’m a big busted woman and these did not work for me. Not enough support
3.0,"Beautiful coloring, just didn't work out size wise."
3.0,"I ordered this thinking that it was &#34;real&#34; terrycloth and was disappointed that it is some kind of thin synthetic.  However, I kept it because I needed it for hospitalization and did not have tome to get another one."
3.0,Typically I order XL. Ordered XXL in this and it fit like a medium. Stretchy material like spandex. Sizing chart not accurate because I checked it before ordering. Gave shirt to my kid.
3.0,Sized right soft and light weight
3.0,"This necklace is great, but not what I thought I was getting. It's a bright silver, whereas the picture seems dark, like pewter. Bought it for my husband, and I'm sure he would have liked it more if it weren't so bright."
3.0,the stones are loose
3.0,Lol!!!! please don’t laugh 😂 😂😂😂🤣🤣 but I’ve been swollowed by these yellow bird glasses.  Well as you can SEE 👀 if you don’t have a huge head these glasses will be  toooooooooooo big for you.  I really can’t make a determination on whether the polarized lenses work because after seeing width of these on my face all else was meaning less.  Normally I wear a 48 or 50 glasses frame; these frames are more 54 and up and  they semi wrap the face. They are cute and stylish so if you have a larger face these are ment for you.  All you 🥜 heads need not order😆
3.0,"Kind of disappointed in the sizing of this leo. My daughter is a VERY small 5 year old and the 4-6 was too small on her— arms, legs and body. Also, I’m not sure if it’s in the description, but there is a seam down both the middle of the front and back."
3.0,I loved this shirt in the picture. It is soft and the colors and imprint are vibrant. Issue is it’s short (states made in China) I bought a size larger (L) to wear with leggings so that won’t be happening ...  Still a fair fit to wear with jeans.
3.0,A bit more chunkier look than Expected.  Fit well and is comfortable but not as esthetically pleasing.
3.0,"I liked the price of this and while it fit, I felt like it was a little more snug than I was comfortable with. The actual hooks seemed a little cheap but it wasn't bad overall. I did send it back though because I wish it was a little looser an that there was a little more stretch for overall comfort. I think if you're really thin or don't mind a snug fit, then this would work well."
3.0,"The cloth material is not strong enough such that it easily get torn especially the hoodie pockets.<br />Moreover, the hoodie dimension size was quite large for me"
3.0,"I found the bridge of the nose on these glasses to be super uncomfortable, no matter how much adjusting i did to the glasses. They are great quality though and are a nice pair of glasses, i just don't know if I can put up with the irritation on my nose. Definitely will hang onto them as a backup pair though!"
3.0,The jacket has 0 insulation
3.0,Shorts were a good fit. They were really cute. One problem with them. I could not button them since the hole for the button was sewn up!! I had to cut a hole in between the slot where the button hole should of been. Other than that they were fine.
3.0,"Just fair.  The sock is semi thin but not bad. But the foot part is not very stretchy so the toes pull of you have over a size 7 men’s shoe.  The compression doesn’t really appear to be graduated, but isn’t bad.  Based on the design they will Last less than year. Probably 6 moths. ☹️"
3.0,Very small necklace. Wish they showed it how it looks on the neck before buying. Otherwise it's pretty.
3.0,They are a little tight.  May want to order a size larger than usual.
3.0,Okay kinda cheap but worked for the ocassion
3.0,CUT EXTREMELY SMALL
3.0,It looks good and the mechanism works ok. The only issue is the belt needs to be longer as the attachment starts too far from the end of the belt.
3.0,Since it was a gift and sent directly to the person I cannot rate the item.  Sorry
3.0,Not really wide calf at all
3.0,the straps were too small
3.0,"It is not easily put on or take off the pants. Military tactical belt should be more versatile. It should be able to buckle securely,  put on and take off easily, and have more than one use like: rescue rope, tye strip, belt, or a weapon for self defense. These belt is just for people who don't change clothes alot, It is a pain especially if you want to use the same belt from long pants to your short or vise versa, or change clothes often. The buckle doesn't slide through the belt loops on the pants. If I was designing it, I know I can do a better job than that."
3.0,I like the colors of this bracelet.  My problem is fastening the darn thing.  It takes two people to put this bracelet on.
3.0,"The hat itself is great, but the metal rivet holes rust and stain the fabric!"
3.0,"Super cute for summer but extremely low quality even accounting for price. I'd recommend this for a pool or beach party where you'll take lots of pictures. Wear a nude thong and don't expect it to last more than a couple wears.<br /><br />I'm 34C/D, normally wear sz S/M and a 28 in jeans. I got a L and it was too big."
3.0,"I ordered these in the white/gray print and fell in love, went back to order two more, rose and black and they are way to small and sort, same size supposedly as the white.  I'd love more of these pants but returning them is not an option and I am throwing out the two pair that are at least a size smaller and looks like ""I'm flooding""."
3.0,"It's a very nice watch, but not unisex unless you are a very large boned woman. Everything about it screams man's watch, and the smallest I could make the wristband left enough room for another wrist under it."
3.0,unaware it was super tiny. but cute
3.0,These are okay for knock-offs.
3.0,"Beautiful watch with a ghetto clasp. My clasp might just be broken. Want to love this watch, but I feel like it'll break off with this janky clasp in less than a week. If I paid anymore than $17, I would've given this a 2."
3.0,See through. Very thin material.
3.0,"If you arent loooking for support and just need coverage you'll love this. If you need any support, you won't.<br /><br />I read the prior reviews and the low scores were all from women with DD (or at least large chests) and kids. I have neither, so tried it. I returned it because I do need some support (C). Also, after 6 hours or so my skin started to not like them. These seem to be best for events rather than daily wear."
3.0,I should have the next size..:(
3.0,Didn’t like the fabric. I was expecting something softer
3.0,We was satisfied with this.  This was for prom for my daughter.  What we got wasn't exactly what was pictured.  But for the cost it was good deal.  It had a embellished thing on the front.  I just removed it & it was fine.
3.0,"This pj set was nice, light and comfy."
3.0,Very Cute.. Well made. I got this for my 1st grader to wear to pajama day at school. However it is way to HOT to wear even during winter.
3.0,"It's a little see-through, I wish it was a little longer. But it's unique."
3.0,Just fit little big
3.0,The suit was really nice. It fit true to size and felt like it was made of good material and sewn well. I had to return it though because unless you have a perky bust it won't fit right.  My bust were in one area and the formed cups were a couple inches higher.  I was pretty bummed it didn't fit because I loved the suit otherwise.
3.0,Very cute but definitely not an over the knee sock. They are not long enough for that. Also ordered the grey pair and they are not grey they are purple!
3.0,GF love owl stuff.
3.0,Wish the links where a little more longer and had more link covers to cover the other end but it’s still beautiful nontheless
3.0,Has no pockets. Wish it did!
3.0,"its for a toddler, not a baby. why does the strap across the shoe say baby? ridiculous"
3.0,Cracked on the lower part of the frame after about 3 weeks. I guess this is a common issue with these frames. I took care of them so they were not dropped or subject to any abuse whatsoever.
3.0,I wanted to love this - sounded like a good thing to layer with for winter but it was so much smaller than I expected. I did order a size up from my normal size but there was no way I could struggle into it. I passed it on to a child and she is getting some use from it but she's about 10 I think. She likes it and says it does work but I can't judge. A size or two would be workable but this is way too far off.
3.0,The material was not what I was expecting. I can wear it around the house!
3.0,"They are right about the pockets being too small. I kept them, but I probably should have returned them. the other issue I have is in the crotch area. There's not much room. The gray is actually brown colored. I'll wear them because they look o.k. but for comfort, I would look for something else."
3.0,these are pretty comfortable and wash well.  The waistband is too rigid and tight for my tastes in pajamas.
3.0,Delete this item
3.0,Bought this as gift and good portion of the metal has a dull finish so not so attractive and has small scratch on back. I guess for the price it’s ok but I wouldn’t give as a gift
3.0,"Sneakers are nice, my daughter loves them but one of the sneakers lights do not work. How can I fix this issue?"
3.0,"Cute, but the design was not quite as advertised, and the clasp is extremely weak."
3.0,"The product I order was a mens large. I am a women's large. It was way too tight for my husband, he couldn't button it. I could barely get it to button on myself."
3.0,I'm pretty petite (5 feet with narrow shoulders) and the small was too large for me so I had to return it.  Cute on the model though.
3.0,I don't know what to think of this hat. I don't think the hat knows what to think of itself! The hat has a nice deep cap which I like. The bill on this hat is huge! I think you could land a small plane on it! The material of the hat appears to be a running hat but the trucker style seems to indicate otherwise.
3.0,They are so small I thought they were gonna be thicker but I can probably use it for my ear
3.0,Runs very small otherwise it's a cute costume
3.0,Love the bottoms so much! The top however was weird fitting. Too big around the waist and the cups weren't supportive. Super cute suit but I've had to make some adjustments to the top.
3.0,The band is hard to get on and it is not tight enough once you get it through the clip.
3.0,a little too large for me
3.0,It's very comfortable but I normally wear a medium so purchased an XL and it's a smidge small. I am 5&#34;7 and around 130lbs.
3.0,Sizeup especially if you are busty.
3.0,This didn't fit my watch
3.0,"Like the print, but the medium seemed like a 'small.'"
3.0,"Definitely under sized. Says 7 1/2 fits like an 8+ . you may have to order a couple sizes down, depending on how you like then to fit."
3.0,"Definitely meant for children and not for adults. I thought the tutu was separate from the shirt but it’s not. I wasn’t planning on using the shirt part so I hid it under the corset for my costume instead. The tutu was cute and looked just like the photo. Pom-poms were nice but broke off shortly after. Did not use the neck part because it was uncomfortable. The socks were cute but basic so I didn’t wear them. The stick for the balloon was a nice idea so you don’t have to buy a helium one. If you’re looking for a clown costume for a child it’s a good choice, not an adult."
3.0,it is tiny! like crossbody clutch tiny!
3.0,It rubs against your skin and makes you sweat
3.0,"Love the cheetah print on it. I also like the length.  I think the materiel is good. The only down fall was the size, too small."
3.0,"I feel like the only person that did not like this dress. I am a HUGE online Amazon apparel shopper, but this one didn’t do it for me. I had high expectations and have successfully ordered from this vendor before. The material was almost ‘linty’ and didn’t appear as nice as it did in the photo. The fit was very awkward. I’m usually a large in these Asian vendor sizes (5’6, 165lb, curvy, 36DD)... I couldn’t tell which was the front or back, but NEITHER fit well, both had an odd puckering and felt backwards both ways, lol. The sleeves were just too long I feel like, and I have longer-ish arms. Not sure ladies, but this one was not for me, so I sadly returned it. The print is lovely, just the material felt like if I washed it it would shrink or collect lint on everything and it is not a good fit which could just be me, or not..."
3.0,I like the scarf and the gloves. I like the hat but doesn't stay on my head well. The earwarmers seem to have thin material. Overall satisfied with purchase.
3.0,"Given what I paid, im happy with what I got, although I expected more. The small pouch was a nice touch, but the fact that it was hollow from behind didn't impress me. But my mom likes it, shes happy, and im happy."
3.0,"Love the concept, but just after one wash the black is fading. I hope this shirt will last for my Disney cruise in November. I do not feel it will last long."
3.0,Small for my 10 year old son.
3.0,"Cute dress, poorly constructed. Before I could leave the room, one of the straps had popped off from the stitch. Otherwise the fit was as expected."
3.0,The straps were too long. Hopefully it will fit by Spring so we can still use it.
3.0,"I have never purchased Umi shoes for my kids before, so I thought I would give these a try since they were cute. These shoes are adorable and have gotten many compliments, however, the stitching started coming out on the top of the shoe in less than a month from purchase date and they scuff up really easy. Very cute, but do not hold up to a toddler's day of playing. I wouldn't buy this brand again and would instead spend a little more money for brands that I know better."
3.0,"It’s a decent watch, I do not really have anything bad to say about it."
3.0,I have to say that I was a bit disappointed as it has way less tassels threads compare to the ones in the product details. It does not look as beautiful as advertised. Additionally it has a few scratchers in the gold plaque part. In the black earrings it has a faded spot in the gold plaque which made me a bit sad. Overall from dar it looks good but definitely not as in the adversing picture.
3.0,VERY cute scrunched style hats. True to color as shown but one did get a hole at the top after only a few wears. Luckily grandma was able to fix it. Otherwise kids loved them!
3.0,They were pretty. I would have preferred the silver to shine more.
3.0,"It’s nice quality but was so disappointed that it’s not 3D all the way around, the back is flat. Description isn’t misleading though."
3.0,"Ordered a xlarge at first based off reviews. XLarge fit okay in waist but very snug in the back area and chest area. I have broad shoulders and large breast. Very self conscious. I would recommend if your large in the chest area to go up a size. Reordered a xxLarge and fits perfect. Very soft material, love the pockets and colors of dress"
3.0,Ok. I kept it mostly for the color. No inside pockets. The outside pockets have a hard to use snap and not a zipper. Although it's not very big I agree I don't like it saying the Lands End on the outside. I paid for it I shouldn't have to advertise for them.
3.0,Suspenders worked fine but bow tie was too small for my husbands neck..
3.0,"My son loves these shoes.  They are popular and make him look stylish.  I do have to say I like their appearance...  I just wish they held up better.  The whiter portion is fraying and looks ragged after a month of wear, and they don't come clean in the wash even with stain treatment.  For $100+ shoes I expect better quality."
3.0,"A little less than I expected. Very well-made, however they run a little small for the size. Should have ordered a size larger.  I was expecting side pockets like cargo Shorts but they’re only front slit pockets and no rear pocket. A little pricey! Otherwise, decent product."
3.0,Not what I was looking for it to look like
3.0,"I wear a size 9-10, so I got the large. The gap on the open toe is far too wide; my foot slides right through. Also the area going over the top of the foot is too big also; too much material.  The quality of the material and sewing seems good but these slippers are simply too big; unable to wear. Disappointed; plan to return."
3.0,"It fits fine everywhere except my arms and I did size up, the material is not soft or stretchy in the slightest. I can see myself getting hot and uncomfortable in this real easy. It’s not breathable and pretty constricting."
3.0,"The product fit beautifully, but it did arrive with a rip on the bottom. I'm sure it easily could have happened in transit. For the price it's just easier to keep as is!"
3.0,Ordered the small. The neck is too open so it falls off the shoulders. Very crop top style.
3.0,"The dress fits the body great, but the sleeves were extremely big."
3.0,The actual color is teal. I wanted light blue (as the picture appears to me) sent it back and reordered.got the same teal. More green than blue. The company was easy to deal with.It was packaged well. The material luxurious but just the wrong color. I have as a gift but will probably get it back need on that teal green color.I will wear it.
3.0,"Warm, but I've had to resew the string on twice now."
3.0,Looks good but runs small. Not a lot of stretch. Order one side up if purchasing this.
3.0,zipper is irritating at the top.
3.0,Not true to size. Order a size 9 and the ring that came was smaller. Had to lubricate my finger to get the it on/off
3.0,"So I ordered this knowing that it obviously wasn't going to look the same as the picture because I have a heavy chest, but it ends up looking nothing like the picture. The material is really soft and comfortable, and very stretchy. It looks great as a casual beach dress, but definitely doesn't give off the same vibe as the model does. I'm not going to return it because it's comfortable and I can definitely wear it around, but not to the wedding I'm going to. For reference, I have a 36 inch waist and bra size 34K (US)."
3.0,"Very well made, but the size was a bit too big on me. More specifically, the shoulder seem was a bit too far down the sleeve. Then again, I'm picky about that kind of stuff. Otherwise, it's a fine sweatshirt especially for ten bucks."
3.0,TLDR: skip this one and get a different Casio. Gets dirty too quickly.<br /><br />Purchased this watch and after only a few months the band and band holder hand completely tarnished to the point I didn’t want to wear it anymore as I felt it looked dirty. I suppose this is inevitable with crystal resin but still disappointing as it is a really cute watch. If you are purchasing for a photo shoot or an ocasional accessory then this is an okay buy but defiantly doesn’t hold up to long term normal wear and tear.
3.0,The are comfy but a little large for the sizes. The shirts look as though they would be snug and form fitting but they are not. I have a little issue with the girls falling out of the sides while doing yoga but other than that they are quite comfy. They wash well and don't shrink (even though it would be a benefit at this point).
3.0,"These looked nice, but scratched within a week."
3.0,Look cheap and child like
3.0,"It's pretty. However mine is just purple and I thought it was supposed to be rainbow. I've checked in interior and outside lighting and it's just purple. I'm going to keep it because I do think it's pretty, but I will think twice when deciding if I will purchase from this company again. 2.5 to 3 stars."
3.0,"Please please know that this is not a going out and about dress. This is geared towards being a beach cover up. Unless you are a size 6 and under then this is not even a beach dress, but becomes a tight shirt! A size 6 is even pushing the decency limit. If you wear a small or a medium you might get away with it. Anyone any bigger and it is just to tight and does not flatter you. Ok now that I got the sizing out of the way. I am not trying to be rude but just sensible and practical. It is a shame to see women attempt to wear clothing meant for someone half their size. I am bigger but I purchased this for a skinny grandchild to throw on when we go to the beach.<br /><br />She has indicated that it is very comfy. It is fun, girly and cute is my own personal opinion of the beach dress on a slim person. When we hit the beach, we get hungry after while and need to cover up to go to lunch etc. This cover up is fitting for a beach-side cafe. I like the fun print. It is easily washed and I hung it ouy to dry. The garment is lightweight and stretchy. For a tropical destination vacation this is what she can wear around a resort pool as well. The colors are so cheerful and vibrant. Please remember that this is a beach cover up, not a going out and about dress. It is going to be shapeless and large on some. It is one size fits all but really no it is not if you are much beyond a size 6 or a size medium. There is no need to complain about the shape as most beach wear coverups do not have a shape. I knew this before my purchase. Overall the quality is on par with other beachwear priced in the same monetary value and the colors and texture are also what will bring me back as a customer. She is happy to hit the beaches and bring this along. I received this product at a slight discount in exchange for a review of my honest and unbiased opinion."
3.0,These are not compression gloves. They offer no compression factor. I am short and thick woman who wears small to medium gloves and I do not have small arms or fingers. So it’s not a factor of them being too big or not fitting correctly. If you’re looking for compression gloves you should look for different ones.
3.0,"it's super cute! great material, almost silk-like. both the shorts and top are cut a little on the small side. would definitely order one size up"
3.0,"Super cute necklace, just be sure not to submerge in water, because it tarnishes easily."
3.0,I like the size but not sure why there are snaps.  Makes this a bit bulkier than I prefer.  Color and quality are nice.
3.0,The necklaces rose was yellow not cream. Other wise I do like the necklace. The necklace is a nice length.
3.0,"Even though the packaging and advertising reads XXXL unfortunately, these socks are not. However, these socks get the job done but I was and am still working on finding longer socks."
3.0,Fits pretty small...size up 1 to 2 sizes
3.0,"It is a great bag, unfortunately i can’t use it yet because it smells really, really badly. I can’t get rid<br />Of the smell. Any helpful hints?<br /><br />Kristina Holmes"
3.0,It was good<br />But the material was not good as expected
3.0,"This is cute and fit like a dream. However,  I've worn it 3 times and it's already lost its shape around the neck and armpits. What a bummer."
3.0,Size runs a little small. Had to return.
3.0,"My son loves these shoes, I didn't have the heart to take them away after I discovered the toe box is too small for proper foot development. Also the lights on the toe on the right shoe stopped working after 3 days."
3.0,I wear 7.5 shoes size. Two out the three socks I tried just barely fits. Got a blister from the fishnet style sock due to the material not fully covering the toes. Otherwise they are nice.
3.0,"Beautiful dress but disappointed in how small it is. Went off the measurements in the size chart and, based on those, my petite 7 year old would have needed the 6 year size. I ordered one up and got the 7 year size so it would have some extra room. Sadly it is much smaller - I am still able to get her in it, but it is very short and snug. I'd suggest ordering up 2 sizes from the listed measurements, even for a petite child. If your child is big for their age, this dress may not work. Lace is beautiful and I love the dress overall, just wish the sizing was better."
3.0,"Cute design, but wtf is up with these awkward buttons? When you snap them in between the buttons is open and you can see what you are wearing underneath. Did anybody even check this product out before they sold it? Go back to the drawing board."
3.0,It looks very nice on me but I don’t particularly like the feel of the fabric. I will keep it and wear it though but not one of my favorites.
3.0,"Just be advised this is very cheap Halloween quality, I was hoping for better suspenders and bow tie for my sons Blippi themed birthday photoshoot and ended up having to buy those separately instead."
3.0,I had to return due to size was too small even though I followed the size chart.  I liked the fabric and look of the shirt though.
3.0,Item looks as shown in pic.  However side pocket for phone insert I don't think is ideal for Android phones but overall its a good buy for its other intended usage
3.0,I'm 4'10 100lbs small arms and short torso. The sleeves fit perfect and perfect length but shoulders too big I got the XS. But it fits good enough were I can pull it off as perfect size. I only got this coat bc everyone complained it was too small.
3.0,Too small since I have a big butt and legs
3.0,The shorts are a little too skimpy and leave nothing to the imagination. Set is washing well and has had zero color transfer issues.
3.0,I like the jacket. It fits as expected.  The only thing i do not like is the way you zip it.  The zipper opens up even when you align the top and bottom zipper.  Its very frustrating.
3.0,Cheap sunglasses that are really pretty well built for the price.Shipping on the other hand was absolutely dismal...all told probably close to two months. I'd recommend the glasses only if you will not need them immediately.
3.0,"Purchased for use as part of a costume for an upcoming Halloween window display. It is longer than expected. The fabric is on the coarse side, it will work for my display but I would not recommend it wearing as part of an actual ensemble.  But the price is right, and with a lot of very gentle steaming, it looks passable and will work for a costume."
3.0,"This is an attractive red, white, and blue hoodie. Had I known it was 100% polyester, I would not have ordered it. However, it fits well, has two large pockets at the waistline, and a drawstring hood. It did arrive extremely shrink wrapped, so it came out of the bag incredibly wrinkled.<br /><br />I ordered an XXL and should have ordered an XL because it is true to size. Someone said it ran small and that is just not so. An XL would have been loose on me and this XXL is swimming on me.<br /><br />This can only be washed on the wool setting and needs to be air dried."
3.0,OK watch. The hands do not keep time very well but the digital does. Batteries are super hard to replace. very durable though.
3.0,Way too short to be a dress.
3.0,Gator fits great but the filter that goes inside the pocket keeps coming out.
3.0,This shirt was a combination of too big and too small. The sleeves were a little too long and the wrists were really wide so I had to keep pushing them up all day just to stay out of the way. It also was much shorter in the belly area than it appeared in the pictures. I felt like I had to keep pulling it down throughout the day. The fabric is comfortable and it was cozy but I wish it fit better in the arms in the belly. I probably wouldn't buy it again.
3.0,It fits when you buy it but after a was it shrinks and then it's too small :(
3.0,The tanks tend to roll up at the bottom.
3.0,"Was a very nice jacket but was definitely not a typical 3X. My husband wears 3X everything and could not even close the jacket let alone zip it.  I would order a size up, at least."
3.0,"Not as quality as the image shows, be sure to always read dimensions. My daughter did not, whereas I did so she expected the item to be larger than it actually is. SLOW SHIPPING!"
3.0,"I am usually a small in tops, I wish I had ordered a medium....."
3.0,"Good watch band, but too short for me."
3.0,"The earrings I received are not the rich purple shown in the image. They are a pale lavender. If you like that color, go for it. I was disappointed and considered returning them, but I decided to give them to my granddaughter who loves lavender. I am now afraid to order more earrings from this company because what you see is not what you get."
3.0,"The good:  The look, the color and the price!  I don't know if these have any health/healing properties, but outside of that I love these based on the aesthetic alone I love them.  I wear a lot of blacks and grays as my go-to neutral and these fit nicely with that.<br /><br />The bad:  They PINCH the skin on my wrists so often I don't wear them much anymore, which is very dissapointing.  I mean, pinch hard enough to leave marks.<br /><br />5 stars for the look, 1 star for the pain = 3 stars"
3.0,The picture makes it look really pretty but not so pretty when I saw it with my own eyes. I wouldn't have bought it if I saw it first.
3.0,"Not the quality of my other two Chuvora pieces. A little disappointed, but glad I got it at sale price."
3.0,"i got a nice booty for a dude. i run a 32 in board shorts for surfing (need a snug fit), and i couldnt even squat in a medium of these."
3.0,"This swimsuit is really cute and seems like pretty good quality.  Unfortunately it's just not meant for people with an average length toro. Was not long enough to fit without pulling down hard on my shoulders.  I've never considered myself to have a long toro, so this was disappointing it seems to be for those that are more petite in that way and not just average length."
3.0,I’m gonna shoot my wrist and double check the measurements against the size chart and still ended up with fans that were so tight they were uncomfortable.
3.0,I wish it had buttons! It's a nice sweater and looks like it may have a way to stay closed but it doesn't. The pockets are a little shallow but at least they are there. Pockets were one of the main reasons I bought it.
3.0,"Pretty bralette, but sized for AA or A cup size."
3.0,Nice and cool for summer but small for the size.
3.0,"Really love these earrings. No tarnishing so far and an extra pair was sent by accident. A little hard unhinge but not a problem if you get used to it. Unfortunately in one of the earrings, as I was taking them out, the hinge broke. Besides that this is a great product."
3.0,"This watch seemed perfect for my dad. Great size, nice color, large readout, good price. Just the basics. However, it was impossible to figure out how to set the time, and I had to send it back."
3.0,Great quality.  Alot bigger then I had expected.
3.0,The hardware on this strap is bulky lending itself to be used more with a gaudy marine watch or aviator. I like something a little more refined for my field watch but fine for others and is well built with nice materials.
3.0,Very bendy
3.0,"Cut off circulation , more for a kid."
3.0,The fit seems off. It runs smaller and short than how it looks in the photo and I sized up.
3.0,"I typically wear an XL but buy XXL when there are buttons just to ensure I can avoid gaping.  I’m 5’5”  and I wear a 38J and while it fits, it gaps horribly so I’ll be returning.  Other than that, the fabric is soft and light and would have been a very nice sleep shirt."
3.0,"They’re fleece tights, not leggings. Very soft inside."
3.0,"I like it, but its not as long as indicated.  It barely touches the back of my knees.  That kind of annoyed me, bc I really like the longer look.  Either than that, I'm fine with everything else."
3.0,Great watch love the sleek look. Unfortunately the band broke about a week into owning it pretty disappointed.. also the face of the watch is very prone to scratches
3.0,Was a little shocked these pants were from Walmart for the price they were!
3.0,I would order two sizes up for this product. The plus sizes are not very ‘plus’. Quality of the product is ok.
3.0,"My son, 14, really wanted to like this watch, but it ticked so loudly that he couldn't take it anymore. I thought he was just overly sensitive untill I walked down my hallway and stopped when I heard a ticking noise. I was at least three feet away. Imagine having it on your wrist."
3.0,"The pendant is cool, but will switch out the chain"
3.0,"These run small. I’m usually a medium and occasionally a large in pants, a 29 in jeans and 8-10. These tights in large were tough to put on and felt tight around the upper thighs. And yet, I didn’t really sense any control top support.  They do stretch out and feel less constricting after an hour or so, but the material being stretched out accentuates the shininess of the fibers. Not really the look I want. They do provide a modicum if warmth in cold weather though. I’ll continue to use them but not when I want to look my best."
3.0,This was ok. It twisted alot as you move throughout the day
3.0,"I purchased this RFID hard-sided wallet in March 2017.  By the end of January 2018 one of the pins that act as hinges had fallen out (both were loose within a few short weeks), the elastic band that is supposed to hold paper money was loose, and the clip that holds the wallet closed had cracked.  Additionally, the outside is slick that on more than one occasion the wallet slid out of my back pocket onto the floor while sitting.  The case is sturdy and initially I like the wallet very much.  However, it is NOT a long-term product.  It would have been nice if the inside had a bit more capacity as well.  I did not experience cracked inner sleeves as some purchasers have reported."
3.0,"I really like the embroidery and that is why I re-ordered the skirt. I'm 5'5&#34; and 118 lbs and small size did not fit at all too small and too short. I went with size med it fits well , but it is a short skirt."
3.0,"didn't realise it was just  a transfer  but it looked nice , hope husband will like it for his birthday"
3.0,"I guess I shouldn't had inserted 2 cards in each pocket 😕 but yep thats what I did and it ripped. Never had a wallet not be sturdy enough to have 2 cards in each pocket, but oh well lesson learn. Other than that the quality is pretty good."
3.0,These are not compression but they are a decent top. They are not long and sit just on hips.
3.0,I was disappointed in the sharpness of the graphics.  Run low on ink??
3.0,Not my normal Camo pattern
3.0,5'7&#34; 160lbs large fits really tight. Bottoms are unflattering granny panties.
3.0,"... attractive watch, and easy to read the time with a quick glance, BUT, the date window is too tiny to easily read without serious squinting...or a magnifying glass...If this was better designed, it would earn five stars..."
3.0,"I am always on the hunt for different styles of summer dresses that you can't easily find.  I was more than excited about this dress, which I knew would need leggings for me, so the length wasn't of concern.  Unfortunately, upon receipt, the dress was entirely too small.  I was able to get it on fairly easily, but it was basically skin tight and very unflattering.  While I would normally just order another size, I am simply returning this one.  I recommend the dress, as it is very cute and different, but make sure you order up a size."
3.0,I have been considering this visor for some time.  I is big and too long.  I ordered black and thought the sparkles were silvery but they look more gold.
3.0,"Material is soft, length is good, comfortable, and quality seems ok. I gave it 3 stars because I cant wear them outside the house. In this color, it will show every panty line, every ripple, bump, bulge, and cottage cheese. I have them in black and wear them all the time. These tho, yea, not even walmart at 3 am wearable. But thats just me and I am very self conscious. I suspect skinny babes can get away with it - me - not so much."
3.0,"Okay, nice."
3.0,It's much red than I thought. The inner skin goes through a lot. But it's also strong and will last long.
3.0,Sending It Back . Didn’t Really Look Like The Pic To Me . & It Came A Day To Late . It Took 2 Weeks To Get To Me
3.0,"I normally wear a medium, got a large so I can wear over cloths, tight in shoulders. I also ordered a red and got a blue. Not terribly bothered by the suprise in color."
3.0,"The zipper broke in two uses, and carrying even eight pounds in it makes the entire thing sag and not look like the pictures. The fabric feels low quality too.  I wouldn't repurchase this."
3.0,"I sent them back,  some pairs were ok,  some didn't match up,  and some were bent.  To me they were not worth the price. I guess it depends on the batch they send. ""Costume earrings"""
3.0,lightweight.
3.0,"I was really excited to order this dress for my bday festivities.  I was pretty disappointed in the fit because it is not as loose fitting and long as the picture shows. Unless you are on the shorter side, but it barely hit my ankle and I am 5'7 size large in everything. Even though it says order down I still went with my regular size because I like the really loose look. The pockets make the dress stick out quite a bit, giving the illusion of some serious hips. It isn't a terrible dress, and it is wearable. I just wish it was more like the picture shows... a little longer and not so heavy in material. I have no choice but to wear it, but I am not as happy about it as I should be. :("
3.0,This was to be used for my son as part of his formal uniform. He is an adult small but when it stated slim fit I ordered a size up.  I had to give it to my husband who is a large/xl.
3.0,Was not the color of aquamarine. It was too dark
3.0,I ordered an extra large. I'm 5'3 and 135lbs.
3.0,"Within 2 days of using this purse, tears starting showing up all over the bag. Not much even in the bag when I was using it. Very disappointed. I cant return easily since I'm over an hr from a ups store unfortunately. I have contacted the seller and will update this review as changes happen.<br /><br />ETA: Working with customer support now with the year warranty.<br /><br />ETA 2: Got a replacement bag with no peeling present. Hopefully it stays this way as I do really like the bag!"
3.0,It's really cute and it's true to size but it bends very easily. I work retail and can not wear it to work because it gets bent and caught on everything.
3.0,The band is great. It was shipped without spring arms so I can’t use it.
3.0,They are very comfortable even if a little large. One of them had a little tear. If they weren't so cheap I would have returned them. But I thought it was worth keeping since I liked the two that didn't have a little tear.
3.0,The quality of the skirt is really nice but it's not exactly a floor skirt as depicted in the picture. It's more of an ankle skirt which I wanted longer when worn as a high wasted skirt like in pic. I'm 5'3 and thin and normally x small or small fits. It's not long enough like in pic.unless you are shorter than me or want to wear it low on hips..
3.0,I got this dress and it was really cute except the left strap was not sewn to dress. I got it out to try on and found the issue. I contacted Amazon customer service hoping for a replacement but was only given a return option so now I am sending it back. Wanted to take this dress on Vacation in August.
3.0,I love these sandals! I wear a 9 1/2 so I got size 10 and they are super comfortable!<br /><br />Update I wore these maybe two weeks and they started giving me blisters. They are super cute and comfortable at first but now my feet are hurting.
3.0,"Chain is as expected, but no lobster claw clasp only spring ring. Extension piece was silver."
3.0,"Overall, it was a nice and thoughtful added gift for Grandma, but the packaging could have been a lot nicer.  Also, the pin was pretty long and the back closing mechanism wasn't long enough to prevent it the pin from poking through (even on the heaviest jacket).  She did love it though, so considering just clipping off the pin part and putting it on necklace for Grandma."
3.0,My 10 year old daughter loves this dress...very cute but was almost too small when we got it. Wish there were bigger sizes. Good quality fabric and the pockets are a big hit.
3.0,Very affordable. Nice style. Runs a little smaller than expected.
3.0,"Love the hat but the shield is worthless. -- It came so ""crumpled up"" that it is extremely hard to see through. (we will try to heat it up and then try to smooth it out and see if that helps to be able to see through it??) The shield also does not come to the sides as we thought it would and so not sure how SAFE it would be to use?? Seems that anyone nearby sneezing, coughing and so on would spread their germs to you easily. It would have been much better if the sides came back closer to the ears... to protect more area. -- Also, my husband found the same hat elsewhere for only $6.00 (sigh)"
3.0,"Might've been my body shape didn't jive with the style, however it fit.. but looked weird. I was going for LBD, but looked more New Orleans funeral. The pockets kind of ruin the silhouette, too. Returned. For perspective, I'm 5'5&#34;, 170 and 38DD. I ordered the large."
3.0,"It's very delicate, if you pull or get something caught it will rip."
3.0,The stitching needs to be worked on in the sleeves jacket is cute but u pay for the cheap stuff you buy.
3.0,More pink then rose gold
3.0,"Very nice design, but somewhat smaller than I expected.  Also, the silver was not polished on the back of the heart, which I found kind of strange.  I don't own any sterling silver jewelry that's not polished on both sides."
3.0,"Fabric weave so thin you can see the shirt through it. Still, it's comfortable and warm in cool, not cold, weather."
3.0,"The slots for the credit cards are so tight that you can barely pull them out.  When you get the credit cards in, the wallet will barely shut."
3.0,"So i`m usually a size US 6, I`m 140 and have a 28in waist and 38in hips, ordered a size M. The fit was tight in the hip area depending on body type I would recommend a size up as the dress is not stretchy. The dress came exactly like photos, but the inside is not lined and its itchy. Ultimately returned it."
3.0,It had a very strong strange smell. It had to air out before being worn. Sturdiness itsnt really all there. You can see small metal pieces sticking out. It is nice and large though.
3.0,"First, they are cute. I like the fit. I bought these for my tween daughter. They are super cute. I bought some for myself a few months later and they are a completely different fabric, they are like waterproof snow pants, not fabric like hers are. So with that, they are ""noisy"" pants. Kind of annoying to just wear out and about..."
3.0,"I also bought this for Rare Disease Day, plus I'm a big supporter and volunteer for Global Genes. Unfortunately, this doesn't fit ""right"" and is really, really hot."
3.0,"It's cute but very baggy so it's not that flattering. I'm typically a small in tops so that's what I ordered but this fits like most large tops would...even if you purchased a size smaller than you normally would, the style of this shirt is just loose fitting."
3.0,I wear a size 7. They’re very comfy and pretty accurate with the sizing but the leg holes are kind of tight and hurt after wearing them throughout the day
3.0,Top pulled apart at the seam after wearing a few minutes.
3.0,"The self-winding spring is weak and does not last for a full day.  I have to wind it every morning.  Other than that, it keeps good time is is nice looking.  I would not recommend."
3.0,Nice fit but too long
3.0,Too snug around the shoulders without enough stretch. Super warm but not very comfortable. I have average size wrists and arms but I cannot roll up the sleeves.
3.0,Its a $10 steel bracelet that fits and looks half ok. Its fine.
3.0,The Pouch in the front is somewhat to small. This would be uncomfortable for better endowed men.
3.0,"Quality is not good, but served its purpose. We used for a one time photoshoot. Not good for more than few wears"
3.0,My headline says it all - nice but arms too tight.
3.0,"These bras have absolutely no support whatsoever. I bought the size listed in the size chart that should have fit my chest, but it doesn’t cover my breasts at all, and is too big over the shoulders; it’s as if I’m not wearing a bra at all because of the lack of support. Also, the straps sit at the edge of my shoulders, not closer to the neck, which makes me pull them up constantly.<br /><br />Only good thing is they are comfortable, but since my jugs aren’t contained on the top or sides I can only wear them around the house. If I tried exercising in these I would definitely get a black eye, or at least lose a tooth or two."
3.0,"I am always on the hunt for winter hats that work with my thick ponytail so I grabbed this NOVMAY Ponytail Beanie Hat to try out. I loved the idea of the soft fleece lining and I thought the tie would be a cute look. Unfortunately, it didn't work well for me. The way it's designed, you have to tie it after you pull your ponytail through and I ended up with knots in my hair and an extremely unattractive mess in the back. I gifted it to my short-haired grandma and she loves it! Since she has short hair, I tied the back and now she can leave it tied and doesn't ever have to fuss with it."
3.0,I'm 5'2 and this costume didn't cover my shoulders.  It doesn't have stretch so it was tight everywhere.  This is the first time I've ever had to send back a costume as the medium always fits.  Don't not buy it it's decent quality just go up one or two sizes.
3.0,These black shoes were true to size. The material was very slippery where the sole of my feet touched. They aren’t very comfortable. I wore them while on vacation.
3.0,i ordered the 3x which fits like a XL...its cute but very short...will give it to a friend..i can wear a 1x/2x but this fit is very small..not a normal size in the US
3.0,"Disappointed, thought it would have a fuzzy cashmere feel. It is just a basic cotton knit blend. The light blue is a sea foam."
3.0,"Pretty to look at, but difficult to place on my ears in the morning when getting ready for work. It takes quite a lot of ear lobe manipulation to get it on your ear correctly. I have to use a stethescope often during the day, and it makes my ear cuffs come off my ear and just dangle. Nice if you don't use your ears much!"
3.0,i love it and so does my friends there all fascinated however it didnt get a 5 because it can be a little uncomfortable where it clamps the ear but its real unique
3.0,"They came bent in half in the packaging, but the picture quality is good. I’m currently flattening them with heavy books anywhere from overnight to the next couple days to see if i can get the bend out."
3.0,Size up on this one.  It is sooooo small.  Otherwise a very cute outfit for the little ones!
3.0,"It's OK. A little smaller than I thought. Also 3x more expensive than Target had it listed for. But, when I went toTarget there were no more jackets available. Could not find anywhere else online either. It is cute and I hope my girl likes it."
3.0,"These pants are made for someone who doesn't have any genitals whatsoever, because if you do have genitals, they will show through these pants."
3.0,Like them but since they are mesh feels flimsy but ok with the product and look
3.0,Reading glasses
3.0,Doesn’t fit as expected. Pretty tight
3.0,I like it but the material is a bit weird for me. It’s very wrinkled and I don’t know how to get the wrinkles out. Otherwise I will use it to work outside to keep my head out of the sun.
3.0,It’s pretty cute but not so appealing to me it’s more like a kids sunglasses.
3.0,Hi I received the order right on time<br />I love the material and perfect ankle length as I needed<br />I wish I could have been ordered one size less<br />Rohini
3.0,Product is fantastic as leggings are very soft and comfortable and also very flattering.  I was disappointed in one purchase because I specifically ordered this to have the pocket for my phone.  One had the pocket and the other didn't.
3.0,The bracelets bangle set looks very artifical and quality is okay.
3.0,Fits great. Lauren swimwear seems to have very consistent sizing. The only issue I have is that it snags very easily if using clips to line dry or when sitting on poolside. I always hand wash my swimwear. I wouldn’t attempt to machine wash even on delicate.
3.0,A little thin for my taste but they work!
3.0,"Not lightweight at all. I would not wear this during the summer. It's also boxy. I don't hate it, but I don't love it, either. I've only worn it once."
3.0,I love this dress so much that I ordered 2. The problem is that the ruffle around the midsection is coming apart on both of the dresses in the same spots. I have sent them to my seamstress to repair and reinforce the sewing. The dress is oversized so it is not due to stretching.
3.0,Too small and tight in the top. The length is great.
3.0,I liked it and it fit fine but wasn’t exactly what I was looking for
3.0,This was SO not for my body type.  The color is not as bright as shown but it is a cute dress...just not for me.
3.0,I got many compliments on the look but one of the leather straps broke on the third wearing.
3.0,Works real well
3.0,Strange fit. It doesn’t hang like the picture shows.
3.0,Its very pretty and shiny but i ordered a small but it came as a medium and was a bit loose in the back
3.0,"It was exactly how I wanted to look; however, it broke almost immediately after wearing it a few times."
3.0,"I ordered this outfit for a wedding, although it did not fit it was very lovely.. I did order two sizes up. To locate my order and any questions I had , they were very prompt with their response! They give you a full refund if it does not work for you."
3.0,These glasses look nice and look expensive however they kinda feel cheap and the lenses can pop out kinda easy if you aren't carful. But for the price they met my expectations.
3.0,"The inside of the bag peeled pretty bad. Other than that, it held up really well."
3.0,"Based on other reviews I ordered a whole size up.  Too large, but keeping because I bought to wear around home as I recuperate from a knee replacement.  Other negative:  no pockets!!!  Really are a necessity as I move from room to room.  Pockets would be the redeeming factor!<br />Fabric is nice and cozy and colors are nice...wash well, but barely shrunk."
3.0,Nice ring feels good but nowhere near the detail as shown. Kinda disappointed in that cause that was the hole reason for buying it. But you get what you pay for.
3.0,Pro: Perfect Size for a small wrist (child)<br />Con: Battery lasted 2 weeks before it died.
3.0,"I usually wear an XL, and I bought a XXL so it would be looser. It’s not; it’s pretty tight on my chest and hips. It’s also shorter because of the tight areas, so I’ll have to wear it with leggings. It’s super cute! I was just expecting a bit more room"
3.0,not ever wide but still nice for the price
3.0,"The color was as expected,  the lace pattern looks like old time table cloths, not cute as appears in picture.  Don’t like it much at all."
3.0,"The design is too cute, but the mask itself seems to run very small, almost child sized.<br />Also the ear loops make it very hard to wear if you wear glasses. Only reason I kept them I'd becsuse of the picture of the Yorkie. Otherwise, they would have gone right back."
3.0,I loved the pattern and they were soft to the touch but they had very little stretch to them as I was expecting. I have several pairs of this brand and style from TJ Maxx and other places and they all have stretch but these didn't. The XL just didn't work out.
3.0,love them but wish they stayed on your ear and didn't fall down like a hanging earring.  Problem i have with all these types.
3.0,"There is nothing particularly wrong with these, they just “fog up” when speaking so that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to see your lips/mouth. Cute colors, though."
3.0,"The dress is very shear, might work great for a swim suit cover up. Ordered as a dress so it didn't work out great for my need, vendor refunded my money so I am happy with the outcome."
3.0,"Smells like a chemical. Didnt try it long enough to know if the smell goes away after a while.<br />Works well to keep warm. However, not to be used for high activity because as you breathe harder the exhaled air condenses inside and it gets all wet."
3.0,"Very uncomfortable and when i put it on and tightened it it folded my ears instead of bringing the mask to my face, i don’t like the inner material."
3.0,This is the perfect cover up if you have a small build. Classic one size fits most if you know what I mean. Material is stretchy but it won't fit like the picture unless you look like the picture. Lol. I passed it on to my co-worker since my size 12 hips didn't look great in it. Overall I do like the skirt though.
3.0,Extremely see through and slightly smaller than had planned on them being.
3.0,I didn't like the way the skirt hung.
3.0,Looks better in the pic but it's a solid cap. I like it and will be wearing it when skulking looking for xenomorphs.
3.0,"These things killed my ears. To be fair though, I've never tried a pair of clip on earrings that *didn't* kill my ears! But after 30 or so minutes they had to be taken off before I started to cry with the pain lol."
3.0,"These were very heavy, and much thicker than I expected. Bought another pair that was cheaper and lighter, prefer those."
3.0,easily bent & broken
3.0,Ran pretty small and didn't seem as well made as Skechers usually are.
3.0,"I wish the studs were smaller. I have 6 piercings on one ear and 4 on the other. Thought these would stack better, but they're too big after the smallest options."
3.0,"First off, I love these shoes.  They are so cute in person!  I should have listened to the reviews though.  I wear a size 10 shoe, narrow foot.  These were sadly too small.  I ordered the 41 (biggest they come, and supposed to be a 10) and they just didn't fit.  I'd say they were a 9.  If I could order them in a larger size I would.  Really, really adorable!"
3.0,Verry cheep necklace but u get what u pay for
3.0,WAY TOO LARGE.
3.0,"The shape is fun and I love the color, but they are so flat! It looks silly..."
3.0,Not a big fan of the material.
3.0,I love this dress however the neckline is pretty deep. I placed a safety pin to keep it closed. The material could be better.
3.0,"I like them,but they kind of loose."
3.0,"These run very small, two sizes two small. This is my reason for a bad review."
3.0,It's braided.  The color is good.  But it's thin.  Just more cheap looking than I wanted.  I kept it - but won't order again.
3.0,"A lot of the reviews said the dress ran small so I ordered a size up. Mistake!  Should have ordered my usual size.<br />Cute style, but not a fan of the papery feel of the fabric and the fact the pattern seemed a bit off? Still,  I don't hate the dress, and probably would keep it if i'd ordered it in the right size."
3.0,Super cute....I was going to wear this for a photo shoot...but it was too tight for my thigh...<br />I'm 5'9 135lbs .
3.0,The belt is as described but is not what I was looking for.  It does not hold my pants up as I hoped it would  I bought a regular leather belt with a small buckle that works better.
3.0,This fits smaller than expected and even with the bra extension didn't help and the bottom rolled (see picture) the bra it's self made me feel like I had back rolls and skin rolled over the bra fabric under my arms. The support was very stretchy when you pull down the pad for nursing. I really wanted this to fit because I have a hard time finding bras with no underwrites..
3.0,"This dress is really cute and very comfortable.  However, it is not flattering--it is not fitted at all which I expected.  It is the pattern which is really not flattering.  I've worn it and will keep it but just beware."
3.0,All zippers eventually broke within 4 months.
3.0,I would say that the watch is ok. Not sure you can expect much for 9 bucks. At first glance it looks like a toy but the features work so far. I bought it for the pool. The watch says water resistant the instructions says not.
3.0,Shrinked after washing. Plastic shield is smoky.
3.0,Cute dress but shrank dramatically when washed. I can no longer wear it.
3.0,"Not bad for the price but odd sizing.  Very snug in the upper body but too large in the hips.  I am 5’5” and 110 lbs.  the small was too small on top but will try a medium and if it works, take it in on the sides"
3.0,"If you want a Jayne Mansfield, spilling out of a strapless gown look, this works well for that, at a comfort cost. I got a 36D (no choice) knowing I might have to add a bra extender, but these cups are more like C or big B than D. At least they are quite solid and stiff, with zero show-through, and the band with its inner silicone-lined support bands doesn't budge a millimeter even if I lean over. So no wardrobe malfunction worries at the prom, but this isn't comfortable enough for everyday wear for me. Do size up an inch and a cup size."
3.0,"I ended up returning these shirts. I needed a red and green top and this seemed the best way to go. While the shirts I actually really liked the green was more a neon yellow and didn't work for what I needed it for. They fit as expected, I wear a medium and thats what I ordered. I gave it three stars because I feel like the color green that was advertised is off."
3.0,We bought the yellow one because that's my daughter's favorite color. What showed up is gold. She's on the smaller side and the sleeves hang pretty far down her arm. Going to have to sew it to fix the size. We got the 3-4T.
3.0,Decent but not great. Not as flattering as hoped because there’s way too much material and will probably need ironing. Slow delivery.
3.0,"Should have ordered an 8 or 10. The 12 was massive. 5’1, 145lbs, 36DD. Seemed comfy enough, just not flattering."
3.0,Pockets were too puffy and didn’t lie flat.
3.0,"The pants are great, but the zipper was a cheap metal 1960's style and definitely not appropriate for pants this expensive."
3.0,Not as pretty as expected and tarnishes easily.
3.0,"This watch case and band looks really good on. It has a rugged look, but it isn’t overly masculine. I used it when working since I move my hands around a lot and tend to hit my watch face on something a few times a day. Unfortunately, it is not very durable. The band split right where it attaches to the watch face after once a couple of weeks of wearing it. I was sent a replacement, though."
3.0,Love it but  the zipper  constantly runs down.
3.0,I loved the shoes but they didn't fit me . I ordered 5 or 6 pairs and kept one. They were too large. Very disappointed. I'd order again except I'm afraid of the fit. Shelley S.
3.0,These run pretty tight so I would recommend a size bigger
3.0,"Not Asian fit; they leave mark on my cheek after wearing, meaning they sit on my cheek even I have picked the largest size one.m"
3.0,I thought the material was different from the fruit of the loom from  Wal-Mart
3.0,"Smaller than expected. They work, bit not a good choice for an adult male."
3.0,Some of the necklaces look like they were made from shoe string but others were very nice and stretchy. Most were able to be adjusted to neck size. I would recommend buying the smaller pack! Nice and better price!
3.0,"I am going to try and write this review with an open mind because I know I should not expect this shirt to look the same on me as it does the 5'8 110lb model. I am being sarcastic here  but let's be honest these Barbie doll models are very ""slender"" and the shirt is just not going to look the same on someone six inches shorter and 50bs heavier, but I digress...like other Reviewers, unfortunately, my experience with clothing purchased on Amazon is it is MUCH smaller than what I would find in a store and despite their putting ""USA"" size equivalents to the ""Asian"" sizes I never seem to get it right. So although I generally wear a Large I ordered X-large in this shirt out of concern it would be Barbie Doll size when it arrived and I needed it for a special dinner this week. It was true to fit and I wish I had ordered a large. So trust, if you normally wear a large then you can safely order a large and be just fine. Now, these are the issues I found with this shirt and I am numbering them to make it easier for you to read:<br /><br />1. The material feels some what cheap. I realize the shirt is priced as is but personally, I think it should be more along the lines of $14-$15 instead.<br />2. When you tie it in the front because the material does not have the print on BOTH sides of the material it looks ""off"" because what hangs down from the tie is turned out and does not match the pattern...does that make sense? It's just something that takes away from the ""finished"" look of this shirt.<br />3. While on the subject of the material...you are not going to get the exact same print as on the Barbie doll model because the sheets of cloth will be cut differently for each shirt so no two will be the exact same. This is something I should have realized but you just don't think about these things when you find something pretty and are excited to get one...but mine had A LOT more white on it than I would have preferred and it does not look as pretty in person as the one on Barbie.<br /><br />I ordered two different prints of this shirt and wish I hadn't but I was concerned about how the white one would look because normally white is not a color I would purchase for myself but did so because of the pretty color and pattern but if I had it to do over again I would definitely only ordered one and may end up sending the navy/light blue/red pattern one back because it just didn't look good in person as it did on Barbie. I hope this helps...if you are going to relaxing around the house or perhaps somewhere very casual this might work but anything else, I would pass."
3.0,"Great quality,  but they are really tight. That straps needs to be a little longer."
3.0,"I measure my wrist, and it should have been well within the size listed, but these were way too big. I tried wearing it a bit higher on my wrist, but then either it was uncomfortable from being stretched too much if it was pretty high, or if it was at a comfortable point it would keep falling lower on my wrist.<br /><br />I got some new crimp beads and elastic, took it apart, and restrung it with less beads so it could fit. The elastic I bought doesn't stretch quite enough to put it on while connected, so I have to connect it around my wrist, but now it fits perfectly and looks so much nicer than the stock bands, and without causing the weird rash I would get from the rubbery stock band not letting my skin breath. It does leave a little indent where the beads are but it goes away fairly quickly after taking it off."
3.0,These fit me as long leggings not capri's .
3.0,Love the color and how it's made just small in chest area
3.0,"This are awkard feeling, they're either giving me a wedgie or making me look like I've loaded on myself...i didnt like them."
3.0,"These aprons are pretty good but the ties are just too short! I like to bring mine around to the front and you can't do that with these. Actually, you don't get a very big bow in the back either. I will keep them and maybe add ribbon onto the ties."
3.0,"In the description it says runs large, may want to order size down.  I did, and returned.  Overall the top was nice, and would have really liked, except for size issue."
3.0,These are great if you have thicker thighs
3.0,"I wear a size 12 pants, got an XL in these, and they're way too tight. had to return"
3.0,It kept me cool but the design kept twisting quickly after putting it on
3.0,Diazepam adjustment in the design would be helpful
3.0,"This shoes looks good but, it is NO the original brand"
3.0,the winter gloves are a good driving glove with great manuel dexerity.the only draw back is they don't do much for outside use.i wore them for 15 minutes in 35 degree temperature with the wind blowing and my ha nds were cold almost imediately
3.0,perfect bag and color but tangles a lot
3.0,"This product is beautiful and exactly what I expected, however it breaks easily."
3.0,"I like the print, but the bottom of the tank rolls up a little. I have to keep flatting it out."
3.0,The shoes are cute and soft but runs little small.
3.0,"I usually fit in a 2x w/ other brands. If I get a 3x, it's b/c I like things to be loose. This was a tad too small (I got the 3x). If I lost maybe 15 lbs I'd be good in the stomach, but at the moment I can't wear it b/c it tries to roll up. Not something I want to mess with while I'm trying to swim for exercise!"
3.0,"I’m only giving this 3 stars cause of the top. If you’re looking for a bandeau bikini top where you can throw away the bottoms and just wear the top, then this is your suit. It’s such a shame cause I love the cute adjustable back flounce bikini top. (I’m a 32dd and the medium fit perfect-you could get away with many more sizes cause cup is generous and band ties in back), but these bottoms. They are like an extra small. They provide nice botttom coverage but are skin tight around the waist. Who on earth is this skinny as a size medium!? These bottoms would make a size zero look large the way they dig into your sides. You can see in pic how it cuts into my waist making me bulge out. I’m a size 2- 4 in usual clothes for reference. It will be sent back cause if it’s messed up sizing on bottoms."
3.0,it fits me and i’m smaller. my waist is like 25-26 inches and i’m 5’3 and got an X-small but i feel like i could fit a small too. one thing i dislike is that is kinda see through like i can see the shorts it comes with throw the pleats and i can even see my underwear under the skirt and the shorts it comes with. so i’ll still wear it but it’s really see through
3.0,"Material feels very cheap, and if you're busty definitely expect to wear something under it so you're not falling out of the dress. The material is very uncomfortable, I would not buy again because of that. Also, the arms are quite short and small compared to the rest of the dress and the way it fits."
3.0,Somewhat
3.0,"I like it, but it shrunk a little in the wash so it's a bit tight. Otherwise it's fine."
3.0,"The dress is really cute and flowy. Love the print! Because I am a tad overweight right now, I felt a little preggo-looking in this, which isn’t my favorite. The sleeves aren’t quite as securely attached as I’d like, so be careful putting this on and removing it. Ofher than that, it really is a darling dress. The top is thick enough to bypass a bra, if you’re able/inclined. I’m 5’3”, 163, size 14, 38-33-43. I bought a size L."
3.0,It was a lot larger than it looks online. I'm not crazy about it but will wear it periodically.
3.0,"Very nice style, fabric feels heavy and good quality, but runs ridiculously small. Will be returning."
3.0,"Nice looking dial and band.  Watch says &#34;TSS SparkleStar&#34; on it.  Wouldn't have bought it if I saw that.  Even worse the large second hand is actually used as a part of the timer feature.  The actual seconds hand is the small bottom dial.  This isn't too unusual as other chrono-watches do this.  But what is weird is that the top dial is supposed to count minutes when in timer mode. Every time the seconds hand makes a revolution, this little hand is supposed to move one tick to count the minutes. What it does is just rotate counting off the seconds just like the big seconds hand.  But this dial is only 30-seconds for a full revolution so each minute, it makes two revolutions.  When you stop the timer you look at where the large seconds hand is.  Then push the reset, and the top little dial's hand revolves counter-clockwise.  You are supposed to count the revolutions and divide by two to get the minutes counted (it's a 30-second dial).  Pointless."
3.0,"Size runs small, went up two sizes.  The top button isnt has high i would preferred.  Had to pin to avoid exposing self"
3.0,It fits everything great but arms. Its a tad snug. And the material isn't very soft on inside. Wish it was softer. Will probably make me sweat in hit weather!
3.0,doesnt go above the knee
3.0,"I would definitely not recommend this for a man unless he is quite feminine. I would also not recommend it for tiny wrists or very large wrists. The brown links can be taken off, but that creates a large size difference, and taking one of the latches off does as well. So, there is no way to make a small adjustment to the size, which is a problem. It is a nice watch and comes nicely packaged, but I only see it fitting a few people perfectly. It is either very tight or very loose on my wrist, with the mentioned adjustments made. For reference, my wrist is 14cm in circumference."
3.0,Very narrow - cute shoes though.
3.0,This Joefox watch is nice and really big. There are 2 light buttons for the digital components which are very dim. Analog watch glows well. Alarm functions nicely. Compass face is just for looks which is disappointing. I don't care for the multiple second lights. I shower daily with the watch on and wore it 4 days at a water park without a complaint.  It has also survived 2 days of hard snow skiing with plenty of hard knocks. Buttons are large and responsive. Easy to set.  I would recommend this watch.
3.0,Much shorter than what I expected. I purchased the darker red. Beautiful color!
3.0,Received this dress …and I am shocked it even made to be delivered given the packaging.<br />It was in a clear zip bag similar to a freezer zip lokck bag…you could see the dress inside and the bag was not sealed up.<br />I like the dress…but the packaging it is shipped in is unacceptable.
3.0,Big big big but pretty. Too big for young girl
3.0,The cap is made from quality material and the embroidery is beautiful. It fits very well. The color is a bright orange and I thought it would be coral. I won’t wear this.
3.0,"Much bigger in person but looks very good! Size was accurate, it turned my finger green which I was very disappointed about! I'm so sad because I loved it other wise:("
3.0,"Love the look and feel, however,  it is very small. I wear a size 10-12, ordered an xtra large, and it is tight. This shirt fits my 12 year old who wears a children's 10-12."
3.0,"It's a cute sports bra, it doesn't fit me well at all. For one I usually wear 36C and these cups are too large but what puzzles me though is that the under bust are really snug and uncomfortable. The quality looks good and would have been a great buy if sizing was good."
3.0,"I am pretty much a solid size 8 in womens, so went with my standard medium. At first it seemed to be just the right size, but there's little stretch to the waist, and I heard some seam pops as I put it over head head. Wearing it, it definitely cut pretty hard into my waist into a reverse muffin top. Not a flattering look.<br />Were this to fit me, it would have been an easy 5 stars. While I was expecting something thin like jersey material, it was thick and felt like good quality. Just on a hanger, it is exactly like the picture. It also has pockets! It's only that it's unwearable for me that I had to take off the stars."
3.0,"Good bracelets for work. Am concerned about warning in pack to not get wet or wear lotion - has not happened yet, but I hope they can survive daily living."
3.0,"These are very cheap, one of the peircings got stuck in my nose for a month before I had a piercer take it out for me. They are very cute but piercings for your face need to be higher quality to be safe if you want to wear them more then once."
3.0,Not small but SHORT
3.0,"My hair is shoulder length and has big irregular waves with lots of “rooster tails” I partially dry it, turn my head toward the floor and carefully tuck my hair into the cap to get tighter more uniform curls. However, sleeping in it is uncomfortable and it slips off. On the few occasions I’ve had the time to wear it in the daytime I’m very pleased with the results."
3.0,"I loved the color, the quality, the model...<br /><br />But the XL is more like M.<br />I would order 3XL if I want to feel comfortable but they don't have more sizes."
3.0,Super cute but it’s dry clean only.
3.0,"Pendant is pretty, however nothing exceptional. It's not the pendant depicted in the picture. First, the loop that fits the chain in the picture has a design on it, the loop on the pendant I received was smooth. Second, pendant was very thin and flimsy. I was not impressed with the quality since the orginal price was over $200.00. If I had paid that much for it I would have been disappointed. Since I did not it's pretty and an o.k buy for the current price."
3.0,I wanted to use it with a blazer but it’s too short and too big in the chest
3.0,"The replacement lenses fit as expected. I ordered the Polarized Stealth Black hoping they would be dark. The picture depicts that they are dark, and that the eye wouldn't be seen which is one of the reasons I bought them in the first place. That was not the case. I wish I would have gone with the Elite so that the lenses were darker."
3.0,A little tight around the neck at 1st. But good quality and great designs
3.0,"This dress is fine. However, it looks a bit like medical scrubs (in style) to me. I am very slender with a small bust and thus the top is not completely filled out. But really, other than my perception of it looking like what I might wear if I were a nurse, etc. it's just fine. I put necklaces with it to give it more ... something. It's just quite plain. Not bad, but plain. I've gotten a few compliments on it, however, so there's that."
3.0,"This belt is odd. It is real leather, but the fake pressed-in braid pattern makes it look like faux leather. Otherwise, it is sturdy and functional."
3.0,"It looked worn. Not sure if the white marks on the burgundy dress where from folding, but was disappointed with this purchase."
3.0,"Payed too much for this, in my opinion"
3.0,I really love this dress however it came damage see picture. I am going to keep it and just try to stich the side seems like it just missed on the machine. Good buy over all fits great as expected
3.0,"I bought these masks for my first airplane flight since the pandemic started, reasoning that the copper impregnated filters would be more resistant to passing virus particles. The mask is sturdy and well-made. However, it did not fit well on my face, despite that I am a normal sized guy without a giant head. Once on, the mask was not the easiest to breathe through. Into the box for all my unliked masks it goes."
3.0,Not like featol compression socks. Kind of thin. Not really comfortable
3.0,I’m 5’7 and drags constantly lifting it up to walk. Nice to have pockets wish it was shorter even by an inch. So disappointed
3.0,"It’s alright. Wish it was bigger and had a strap to stay shut. Can’t fit my check register in with my checks. Otherwise, it gets the job done."
3.0,"At first I was really feeling this waist trainer, started using it & day 5 I realize I have a rash around my stomach and back where the waist trainer was laying. I don’t think I will use it again."
3.0,This belt is really nice and pretty. It came in a nice gift box. I bought this per their size chart and it is way too small! I’ll put it up for once I lose at least 20 lbs. Bummer.
3.0,"My son is heading to Brasil and I thought these socks would be fun. He wears a 12 in men's, I wear a 7 in women's, and I could barely get them on. It says adult, and that is completely false."
3.0,"Very soft,  smaller than expected, shorter than expected!  But nice looking. Need to go up 2 sizes."
3.0,"The border stitching is done in white instead of black, AS PICTURED, which gives the mask a more casual look. I was looking for an all black mask to wear when serving at Church funeral services. I did not return this item, because it is very nice and can be used for other occasions."
3.0,This is beautiful but I wish I had seen the fine print where it says it only comes with one piece
3.0,"Meh. Pricey. Doesn't look like the picture, more of a purple hue exists to the hat than perceived in the picture. Other than that, its a pretty all right hat. Would give 3.5 stars if I could."
3.0,"Purchased for a 90’s themed party. The bottoms are not leggings at all, very loose actually. Will wear anyway but not what I expected."
3.0,"I don't like the material very much, it feels too silky like a costume to me. I think this shirt is somewhat large, but I like it better that way. I'm normally a size large and it fit well. The off the shoulder sleeves didn't like to stay off of my shoulders, they kept coming up and looking more like a scoop neck shirt."
3.0,I was disappointed with quality.
3.0,"Great fit but the pink I ordered is a loud neon pink! It’s not  near the color of pink on the description, so I will be returning and ordering the same bathing suit but in a different color. I wasn’t sure if I should go with a small or a medium. I am 140 pounds, 5’6, 36DDD. I ordered a small and they fit great. It does have adjustable straps which I really liked."
3.0,Not the best looking pin
3.0,Not super happy with these and barely weat them. The material is super thin and the just feel and look as cheap as they were.
3.0,Was a little too small.  I wear a medium sometimes large womens. I ordered latge and the sleeves and body were a bit short.  I also purchased a mens x large and was sent and invoiced for a x large womens.
3.0,I didn't bother to try them on my legs when they were tight on my arms.
3.0,"Great top, but I underestimated the size. I normally wear a medium as I normally wear an 8, I wish I had ordered a largent to allow for a more roushed look."
3.0,"They took quite a while to get here, but they are beautiful...the earring balls themselves are much larger than I expected and a tad heavy for the ears!"
3.0,"Cute and thick material, but way to cheeky. I returned it."
3.0,Very Very cute but thin and sizing is weird. I ordered a small and a medium. The small was too small i'm mostly a US size  4 and the medium was too big. Look exactly like the picture on the thin side but good for summer.
3.0,I went by the suggested size guide. Let me say I love the pockets! But these were massively small for me. Your me to get an XL and I did. My frame is 5’6” and I’m 180. Needless to say I should’ve went up a size higher. Disappointed!
3.0,They are hollow.  I knew this from the price.  What I didn't know is how thin they are.  They dent easily.  The keepers are nearly impossible for a man to manipulate.
3.0,These took forever to get here! I'm also not a huge fan of the material since they make my shoes slip around too much.
3.0,"Nice earmuffs but more for a larger person.  Also, I bought a pair a little less that we lined and better quality.  They are nice and lightweight and do keep the air out but not as warm as others I have bought.  I would consider these average."
3.0,Very nice looking but if you live in a place that’s windy I would not recommend. This is good for light rain.
3.0,Super cute print! Soft too. Unfortunately too tight for my wrist!
3.0,Nice and  cool.
3.0,"little to big for me, but they were cheap delived quick, and looked great on my friend i gave them too"
3.0,"The quick release mechanism is really convenient and the strap was able to fit my wrist, but the biggest drawback is how stiff the leather is. It is mildly uncomfortable and my watch keeps shifting sideways because it doesn't want to conform to the shape of my wrist. It might be that it just needs to be broken in but I don't wear my watch often enough to do so. I'm going to find something to wrap it around to see if it will eventually take shape for now."
3.0,Very well made just a little small for me
3.0,If the fit was better these would be nice.
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this band.<br /><br />I have sensory issues and I find it very comfortable.  I also love the way it looks.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />The clasp has come undone several times causing the Fitbit to drop from my wrist.  Not sure why I pressed on with it, but I did and now (week 2) the paint has started chipping & wearing off the edges.<br /><br />This isn’t good value.  Should have been $4.95. Might be great for dressing up but the quality isn’t what you need for every day."
3.0,I’d give these a 6 out of 10 it’s a cute set but isn’t the greatest quality materials other than that it is exactly what I expected for the price I didn’t know the center was cinched I just had a baby and it’s the last look on planet earth I want to rock but i guess I wasn’t paying close enough attention
3.0,"Don't let the &#34;Winter&#34; in the name description fool you unless you live in LA or Phoenix.<br />Nice coat for the money.  Definitely order at least one size larger than you think that you'll ever be.<br />No inside pockets, only tight outer hand pockets"
3.0,Liked the style and stuff but it runs small ... this size is made for Asians not US ... disappointed!
3.0,"This loupe is a nicely made about 10X loupe.  For a 10X loupe, it is quite nice and well priced."
3.0,"Looked beautiful for a month, then I just found it on my sofa broken for no obvious reason"
3.0,Jumpsuit was nice. Measurements were way smaller than expected.
3.0,"For starters, I ordered the size I normally wear, and this is pretty snug.  The material is also very clingy, which doesn't help matters.  My main reason for this review is to address the misrepresentation of the color I ordered.  I ordered this shirt in &#34;Red&#34; to use as a shirt for my Halloween costume, but the shirt is actually a vibrant coral color.  I will keep it, but it is not what I expected."
3.0,"There are three large pockets, with little structure, that everything gets lost in.  I wish there was at least a side pocket for a cell phone so you didn't have to fish through the entire thing to find it."
3.0,"As much as I like this purse, all my stuff wouldn't fit in the bag.  Couldn't find it in a large so I had to send it back."
3.0,"This jacket is on the short side.  It was too big for my son, it was returned."
3.0,"This bracelet is large and can be sized down by bending it, however if you are a small size it may not look as nice.  The quality is not as nice as in the picture.<br />I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review."
3.0,"Scratches easy, doesnt fit well, slides around and is cheap looking for a watch that costs $300."
3.0,"i love this necklace! it makes me feel like prince when i wear it, but it recently broke after only wearing it a few times. i've seen more expensive versions in other stores, so maybe this is a ""get what you pay for"" type situation. i will have to fix the links and wear it again soon. i need my protective eye. ;)"
3.0,"Pretty good, however only the ones with print have thumb holes, and the other ones are just a sleeve which is much shorter then your arm. I bought these for my husband and I'm a female in my arms are longer and it barely comes to the end of my arm.  I will keep them because he really likes the patterned ones so that's all I'm concerned about. However it would have been nice if they all had holes for the thumbs and they were longer"
3.0,The bra area is very big doesn't fit properly
3.0,Can’t be on braclet
3.0,"Good look and comfortable, but cheaply made.  One of the lenses' protective screens/paint started coming off.  Returned."
3.0,"Not that great of a fit, the lower 1/4 of the dress had to much material, and the quality was mediocre."
3.0,Highly functional but camo pattern in the photo is not the same as what is on the product received.
3.0,I’m not that impressed
3.0,I reviewed the DVDs and found that some of them kept skipping. This is not good for a effective workout.
3.0,"The size small could fit a teenager, not a 7 yr old."
3.0,Pretty a little to small would like a little large ( heart)
3.0,"The model in the photo looks awesome...I did not feel awesome. This is NOT a push up top and I'm not sure how to describe the fit as the leg holes were a bit small while the top felt a bit large(I ordered my normal swimsuit size per the size chart). the 'padding' is built into the top and was cone shaped, it's basic swimsuit thin padding...hence my description of the fact that this is NOT a push up. Sending it back :("
3.0,"Pandant is really nice and qood quality but not very happy with chain quality, it broke in few uses."
3.0,I like the style but it fit smaller than I was expecting
3.0,"I specifically ordered this product because it was the men's version of the bracelet.  There is a regular version available as well from a different vendor.  This men's version feels very big on my wrist.  It would slide half way up my forearm until I bent it closed.  Now it fits, but i can't take it off.<br /><br />Also beware the quality.  Stainless steel is pretty hard to mess up, but the writing is another thing.  I've had it one about two weeks and half of the black in the stamping has come off.  Now, I kind of like the recessed silver on silver look, but others may not."
3.0,cute shirt but I should have ordered extra large instead of large.
3.0,"The top is tiny.  I sized up and could barely cover the “girls”, and I’m not large chested at all.  B cup here.  I didn’t even bother trying the bottoms.  Ordering suits online is always risky and this was a fail.  Cute idea.  Super soft material.  Design fail.  Disappointed as it is so cute."
3.0,Material was cheap…runs small and didn’t fit.
3.0,came with silver paint stains and gunk all over it. But again it’s cute and I’ll just put nail polish over the scuffs
3.0,"Kinda hard to tell from the photos, but it's cute and everything. But every time I bent down the belt buckle clasps would break apart."
3.0,These probably work well with the plastic frame glasses. I should have known better because of the thin ear piece of my wire rimmed glasses. My fault.
3.0,Cute but runs small. She usually wears a 4-5T & I got a 6X & it fit. Really cute but they cut the material upside down & the dinosaurs are upside down.
3.0,It shrinks get a larger size.
3.0,I have a large chest (38dd) and this just did not even cover my boobs. Very disappointed!
3.0,"I got this bag in December 2007. The white cloth side is now very dirty (can you wash this bag?), and the other side frays EVERYWHERE. No matter which side is facing outwards, I end up with light brown fibers all over my shoulder and arm everytime I carry it. I used it for college, carrying a few notebooks and a textbook or two, but it just hasn't held up. When I do use it, I end up having to brush my clothing/jacket off every time.<br />The money went to an excellent cause though."
3.0,These handkerchiefs are quite pretty.  They were daintier than I expected and very thin.  The thinness was e a little problematic with machine embroidery but probably well suited for hand embroidery or plain.
3.0,I wanted to love these but the fabric was lacking durability. I will have to say they look super adorable standing straight for a pose but unfortunately would not wear out in public. The fabric is thin and delicate. Bending over in these was definitely a no-no and could hear the stitches hanging on their last thread.
3.0,Good quality shirts. Definitely a bit small though.
3.0,This doesn’t have the shine you would expect from a “diamond cut” chain. I ordered 2 others from different sellers and this one just isn’t up to par with the rest. Shine/cut isn’t impressive.
3.0,Wasn’t the right fit for my body type.  I have a long torso and shorter legs and it hugged curves at wrong places.
3.0,"The material is thinner than some of my other visors of this type, but functional..  The seller packaged the visors in a box smaller than the visors and bent them to fit.  I am trying to straighten out the crease in the visors.  Two are still noticably creased."
3.0,The shoes are a bit hard and don't seem like they'll be comfortable and then ran 1 to 2 sizes too big. I only kept them because my lil will eventually grow into them and can be used for camping.
3.0,"Fit is slightly small. Just your basic quality replica, not even close to a real jersey but seems like it from far. It ripped the first time I took it off on the side seeming."
3.0,Received the pants like this 😔.  Other than this issue I like the product.
3.0,"This dress has a really cute pattern but is made somewhat oddly! Looks kind of like a high low hem but only in the side panels. I'm a 16-18 and order a 2x. Washed up well, hang to dry and wearing it to work today."
3.0,"SUPER SHORT!!! This is a sweater, not even a tunic length sweater, and certainly NOT a dress.  My wife is 5'1 weight 110lbs and the gray tank top comes to her butt, but does not cover it.  The black sweater looks cute on her, but the quality of the fabric and stitching is like something you'd find for $7 at a discovery clothing.  If you like the style I look elsewhere."
3.0,I really like this nightgown but it just doesn't fit right. I bought a XL becauae I thought that iit would fit better by going off the size chart. It fits good around. My waist but too big around my chest and shoulders. It is also a lot shorter than shown in the picture.
3.0,"Pretty dress but runs small, will reorder in a.larger size"
3.0,"it looks nice in the picture good material, but draped on you its wrinkly and crunches up in the back,  making it bulky in  a way, and the sleeves are too short!"
3.0,"Has a feel a bit like polyester,  it doesn't really stretch and it runs small. I love the pattern on this item, but it's a bit stiff and although it has a softer lining on the inside,  its stiff and scratchy on the outside.  I wish that a better description of what type of material and whether it runs small or large were provided in the item description.  That being said it arrived quickly as promised."
3.0,Cute shoe but terrible quality. It felt very cheap. I ordered a size up to be safe and it was too small on my feet. They didn't feel like authentic sneakers.. rather fake imitation. I was really looking forward to wearing these and sad I had to return them due to extreme disappointment. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll have to invest in some expensive Nikes or something better.
3.0,These are very beautiful beads and I’m so excited to use them to make jewelry but I’m very disappointed that there were some broken inside I don’t have time to send it back to get a new case because it took a little while as it is to receive
3.0,I liked the fact there were pockets in the picture. But when I received them the fabric was gathered on the pockets giving a fullness to the tummy area. Other than that they were ok.
3.0,My little boy was excited to revieve this necklace. He wanted to have something similar to what his older brothers wear. It came fast and included a leather braided bracelet. My only issue is the chain broke the first week.
3.0,"These are cute and match with quite a few of my baby's outfits providing me with good photo ops. But, that said- when you first look at it you feel like you could've done a better job yourself, quality control is missing, glue dots and strings are visible and smeared over the bird. It is not a snap clip as shown in the pictures but alligator clips. The clip is completely covered with fabric so there is no metal touching my baby's scalp but I think this is also the reason why my baby can pull it off her hair so easily. She is six months and she doesn't have good hand coordination yet but she can get these off. It's a good idea but I wish it had been better executed."
3.0,"I like the dress, but it not for very endowed women."
3.0,"I really like this sweater, however, it's much shorter than it appears in the photos. I really like my sweaters to be on the longer side, and this one only falls about 3 inches below waist."
3.0,"I like the deer and flag design, but I was really hoping for a better quality robe for the price. This was $50 and feels like it should have been around $20-30. Very thin, not plush. But it does fit ok."
3.0,"It's cute. But it is not near as soft and flowy as it looks. It's pretty stiff and tight around the belly/hips. I ordered a large, which is a size up, and it's still too tight."
3.0,"I loved the printed color and poly fabric of the dress, however the first is small. I'm 5.6 and 188 pds, and my dress size is a LG and depending on the cut, a MED. So I'm sending back to order a 1X."
3.0,I gave this to my daughter who is a misses size medium.  It fit her well.  WAY too small for me.  There is NO WAY that this is a 58&#34; on top.
3.0,Too frumpy looking for me.
3.0,"This dress is OKAY. It is a thin material that would be great for summer outings. The pattern is pretty, and it is the perfect length. It can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion.<br /><br />I returned the dress because I felt that the top portion was just too baggy for me. I know that it is supposed to be a loose, flowy fit but I felt more like a plastic bag than anything else. If it had fit tighter on top, I would have kept it for sure."
3.0,Very cute but much smaller than expected.
3.0,Purchased for my 5 year old grandson.  He was happy with them but the holster broke quickly.
3.0,"Real leather is distinctive. I'm not a clothing snob by any means, but leather is leather. It's hard to mistake anything else for it.<br /><br />This jacket fits well, and looks good enough, but the pleather is really cheap looking. To me, it's quite obvious from the get-go that it's not real. In fact, my wife and I both commented that it's almost like vinyl.<br /><br />If you're cool with that (yes, leather means killing an animal), then this is probably a great choice for you. As for me, I'm torn. I'm not sure if I'll wear it out simply because it looks so cheap. But nothing died (hopefully) for the materials..."
3.0,The colors and material were great but unfortunately this did not fit well due to the larger sized built-in bust cups and wiring. Not a good fit bathing suit for someone with a smaller cup size. Everything else about the bathing suit was true to size.
3.0,"I love the bracelet, it’s a great dupe. However it tarnished/became discolored very quickly. I don’t shower or swim while wearing it and take it off every day before bed. The silver became discolored within a month of wearing it."
3.0,Wasn't a flattering fit... Pockets a little high for me... may gift to someone else.
3.0,"Pretty pattern, decent quality, but runs small. Only has one belt loop?"
3.0,A little too low
3.0,"The color is great, but the material is super clingy. Definitely expect to wear an undershirt."
3.0,Product was a size to small.
3.0,Not the colt represented it was more of a neon I did not like
3.0,"Simple comfortable style. I followed the size chart precisely and the dress was too big. I’m 5’6” 170lbs with a 38DD bust, and the XXL was very loose. I can sew, I’ll adjust it."
3.0,They look alright but the size chart is not accurate I bought a large and they fit like a small .
3.0,"Not super soft nor as flattering as in the model pictures, but it's nice enough. Ultimately I decided it wasn't special enough to keep since it was kind of scratchy. I did prefer the snaps to the zipper versions of the similar shirts. I'm 5'5"" and 135ish."
3.0,"Love it, but fit was just a bit tighter than I would ve liked...<br />still a great buy!"
3.0,Guess its ok... keeps sliding down!... plus side.. in winter it keeps your whole face warm! Like the fact it has a pouch in it for filters!
3.0,Necklace was okay. Looks better on picture.
3.0,It fits well and beautiful but poor and cheap fabric. Very disappointed
3.0,The heart turned copper looking and the chain itself got to looking dull so I took it off.
3.0,Lol it’s ok
3.0,material much thinner than we anticipated
3.0,Sizes run very small!!!
3.0,"Love the bag, but it was shipped flat, so it's got all these weird wrinkles in it. It's not as supple as other Reversible Totes I've bought in the past, but it's cute and big and holds all my stuff, we'll see how it holds up!"
3.0,The white is pretty see through.  The look is great; with rushing along the button panel and slightly structured shoulders.
3.0,nothing fancy but still nice
3.0,Second try still to small. Love this kilt will wait until they have larger size available .gave kilt to my niece .
3.0,"They are OK, but not as nice as ones I have tried on at an eye doctors office."
3.0,Shipping took longer than estimated but I'm happy with my purchase. They're a little smaller than I expected but they still fit in my spider bites piercing. A little snug but not too much to cause discomfort.
3.0,"The pattern is very nice and it looks good at a glance, but it is very stiff material. It came in a clear package and folded multiple times, so it had several creases and wrinkles that needed to come out before wearing it. It certainly isn't packaged to be giftable. The design appears to be sprayed on after the tie was assembled. My husband says it ties well and it goes well with his suit."
3.0,T tried for my kid birthday. It was running small. Ordered correct size. Also the material for not looking great.
3.0,stitching and straps don't appear well finished. They are okay but I don't expect them to last too long or through a lot of washing and dryer trips.
3.0,"I really liked this jacket for my husband, it is decent quality and fits nice, however the belt is not fitted for the size of the jacket. The belt is the exact same width as the jacket, so even placing it on the first loop causes it to be very tight. I have received some money back but that doesn't really solve the problem. My husband just wears it without the belt, but then the loops look funny... oh well."
3.0,"I usually use size M but I read one comment saying how they run small because they are Chinese sizes converted to US size. It's true. I got the XL size and they fit like a medium. I would even go as far as getting XXL. Also, they are not as long as stated. The length is more like regular boxer briefs."
3.0,Seems to leave you walking somewhat flat footed compared to other shoes
3.0,Nicely made with great fit.
3.0,It’s not a wine red. It’s red and very light weight. Like a T-shirt
3.0,Bought these to wear along with my Olive Oyl Halloween costume. They are nicely made. Only complaint is they are heavy.
3.0,Demasiado grande no me gusto
3.0,"This review is of size large. The title says pants shirt etc, description says jumpsuit and the EXACT photos are used in other listings in amazon for rompers/jumpsuits. Because it seems sellers spam titles with lots of words to show up in search results, i read the description and assumed this was a romper. Its not. Its an ill fitting crop (hip length on 36 dd) tank short armpit length, band at bottom very loose fit. Pants are rather large, comfortable waist stretch and plenty of tie length. They do have pockets. They are VERY LONG. I can pull the pants band over my chest and still have length. Now I am short at 5'1"" but even putting the bottom cuff to my ankle the top of the pants goes to my shoulder.<br />Have yet to decide if I will return them. They were very inexpensive and while the top is rather useless for me the pants are comfortable lounge pants with pockets that might be worth what was spent on the set. If your tall this might be a great lounge set. I normally wear an 8-10 pants 28-30 inch waist and i would size down to a medium if i were to rebuy, which I wouldn't."
3.0,"The fabric is soft and the pattern is super cute, but it has this odd quality of sharp, defined shoulders that are not the cozy look I’m going for. I’ve noticed this before when I’ve bought men’s sweaters hoping they’ll work, so I wonder if it was patterned on a men’s sweater vs women. I love everything else about this sweater but unfortunately sending it back."
3.0,"It was very see through. They are comfortable and fit according to size but because they are lightweight, they are extremely see through"
3.0,My son only wore it once. Half of it stopped lighting up about an hour in
3.0,Okay quality but too large and cuter in the picture than in person.
3.0,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I bought 1 size smaller than I should of so  I feel like my review is kind of biased by that fact.<br /><br />I am a Chantelle US32DDDD/UK 32F, panache 32G. I had bought a 32F and that was at least 1 size too small so I think the sizing is more in line with Panache sizing. Decently constructed bra (not as good as panache, Chantelle, fantasies, Bali, etc but pretty nice). It was definitely not as comfortable as my panache underwire sport bra (even the 32F one I have that is too small for me). I think that if it were the correct size it would be an okay bra."
3.0,"These socks say they fit a size 8-10 foot...<br />I'm a size 8 and after washing and drying them they are a bit snug.  Don't know how a size 10 could wear them.<br />I've had a few pairs in the past and they too were snug.  The souls seem to wear out and get holes in them relatively soon.  I'm going to monitor these, as I've not done so with past pairs."
3.0,"Really thick, hard to breathe imo. And my daughters. It has a weird shape that sticks out almost like a rino horn or something 🤣 but for just a quick run in the store thing."
3.0,"I couldn't tell from the photo, but this hat is entirely covered with sequins along the front.  It has cute ears, covered with black sequins.  It reminds me of a Disney item.  It's pretty cute but extremely over the top flashy.  I'm taking some stars off because it is absolutely not cotton in any way shape or form.  It is nylon/plastic with attached sequins.  If you want a cotton hat, look elsewhere!"
3.0,My daughter is tall and thin so the sleeves are a bit short and the body is wide but the lengthen is ok. It's very pretty though.
3.0,Well it's long long enough and fell out
3.0,I was expecting bigger
3.0,"My daughter loved it. However, the socks are very poor quality. They were completely ruined within about an hour of wear. They ripped and unraveled, even with minimal activity."
3.0,"I got the Neatsfoot oil when expected, but got some other brand instead of Fielby's.  No big deal if what I got is 100% Neatsfoot, but now the trust factor has dropped a few points."
3.0,"Ordered my usual size of 8mm and it seems more like a 6mm when placed into my septum piercing. :(<br />Quess if you want 8 mm u might want to order a 10 mm. The piece itself is nice just too damn small, feels like someone pinching my nose. Might try it in another area like my tragus and see how that feels."
3.0,Where the straps meet the footbead is not smooth.  Can't walk very far in these as they hurt my feet
3.0,its a nice coat but it's really thin.
3.0,"I bought a large, I am 5'11"" and have 12 1/2"" calves and a women's size 10 shoe. The stockings were too large in the foot and so long that they covered my knee and cut off my circulation on my thigh. When I turned down the top it would become too tight after an hour. Still looking for the best compression sock for me."
3.0,"Cheap sunglasses that scratch and damage very easily, but good if you want sunglasses to leave in your car."
3.0,"I picked out the navy blue short sleeved dress with pink flowers; this dress fit well and the fabric is nice and thick so it's not sheer but still light weight. I would give five stars but there are some puckers in the seam around the waist, also there's no loop for the belt and it tends to slide about and sag because of that. The seam on the top of the dress goes right down the front to create the V neck and your eyes go right to it."
3.0,Ugly but works fine.
3.0,"Ended up sending these back. I am 5’4” and weigh 200-205 pounds, usually fluctuate between a L and XL in biker shorts. These were thin material (expected) with good stretch in the pants themselves but no stretch in the thin seam at the top of the waist band. I could barely get that top-of-waistband seam over my hips and butt, but once it was on the rest of the shorts were much too big. Loose fabric, etc. But I know if I went down a size, that seam would not have made it over my behind."
3.0,Came scratched.
3.0,"I'll admit, these panties are way feminine  and sexy enough for crossdressing, but... I bought the largest size available which, by the description in the Amazon listing, should have fit comfortably. They didn't. They were way too small, I could hardly get them pulled all the way up, by which time the rather nice material and asembly were too uncomfortable (and let's face it, for non-fetish, non-sexual thrill crossdressers, wearing feminine clothing is all about fulfilling that need to feel feminine, comfortable and completed. These panties did not achieve thst goal. Perhaps had there been one larger size I'd be giving them more stars, but as it is, they are getting one star for the fabric, one for construction and one for their lovely appearance."
3.0,"They’re cute, but so heavy."
3.0,"I really liked the photo and hoped this shirt would fit as well as I hoped... it is somewhat small (especially in the bust) for the size I ordered.  The flair at the hips is pretty big and I wasn't expecting quite such a wide bottom flair.  It is a nice shirt and fabric is nice, color is true, but the sizing is a bit off."
3.0,A little smaller than I expected. It works fine though
3.0,Sweat stains show up immediately in arm pit area and it is extremely hard to remove.
3.0,Is nice but it runs small
3.0,What does the order entail? Does the leotard and the arm bands come with it or is just the cape and matching skirt?
3.0,Not quite what I was expecting but it was good enough.
3.0,The wrist size should be smaller
3.0,"I bought this for a teenager, but it looks a young kids bracelet.  It's kind of small.  But, it is sweet."
3.0,"The shoes are cute. My two year old was disappointed that they didn't fit, so I let her play in them and of course the sliding rubbed the back of her feet."
3.0,"Pretty, but bc of the satin it's impossible to keep closed...not the sash part but the wrap at your chest. Either have to wear something under, or throw on a button or two like I did to make it useable."
3.0,Very pretty earrings. Shipping was fast. Ordering was very easy. The hoops were smaller than I expected. This is a very high quality item. I would reccomend this product.
3.0,Its exactly as described looks to be the right size it's a Christmas gift so I'm not exactly sure but i dont like how it was packaged it was vacuum sealed so it created a lot of wrinkles and it has an odd smell
3.0,"I am assuming that these are not made in the United States!  They were too tight straight out of the package, and even tighter now that they have been washed.  I will not be purchasing again, which is a shame because the design is nice."
3.0,I can’t wear these out because you can see straight through the material. Cute but wear a shirt to cover your butt.
3.0,"I expected I guess for it to look and fit differently than it did.  The material was well made and felt great on my body.  But the fit was not as I expected or wanted. It didn't hold in the bust area at all.  I was scared to death that I would pop out at any moment which in turn made me feel very self-conscious.  The sides were also loose fitting and I ordered it according to the size chart shown for my body type.  The product it self was very well made, good material, did not itch my skin like other and was very pretty.  But the way it fit ruined my experience with the suit.  For me it made me feel bigger than I was and that is my biggest complaint.  When you get a swimsuit, you want it to make you feel good and you don't want to constantly be adjusting the girls and making sure everything is where it is supposed to be.  That seemed that was all I did the entire time I wore it.  The elastic in the middle was also a big problem.  It would roll like a spiral and I never could get it to lay flat like it should have.  It was just constant adjustments the entire time.  So basically the swimsuit was very pretty, well designed but not well fitting. It is not suited for a carefree day at the pool.  If you are planning on lying in the sun all day and not going to a water park or moving around a lot than you are set.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  In no way did that discount influence my review in a positive or negative way."
3.0,I don't care the materials that the dress is made from. The dress was longer than it should be. I'm 5'6 and had to lift it to walk. I'm Okay with this dress but it is not my favorite.
3.0,The dress was great but seller sent the wrong size and buyer was unable to use
3.0,Kinda on the thinner side
3.0,"Very narrow; no shape to construction of these pants, not for a shapely person whatsoever"
3.0,"This shirt does the job for what I ordered it for, but it wrinkles easy. I dont think it is the best quality.  I would not buy this shirt again just due to the fact I believe you can get something better fitting and better quality."
3.0,Received the mask and no filter
3.0,Not bouffant as I thought I’ma Nurse and needed to cover my braids these didn’t accomplish my initial reason for purchase after I took braids down they were fine.
3.0,They’re pretty until they start changing colors they turn black after a while uu wear them I don’t recommend
3.0,Sweater sleeves are short
3.0,The dress is pretty. The bow however is very cheap and the colors don't really match. My daughter is just going to wear it without the bow
3.0,The material seemed nice and had actually pockets unlike most of women’s pant/shorts. Unfortunately the size chart was off and they were a size too big.
3.0,"The sweater arrived in about two weeks, instead of the projected month. At first glance it seemed like it was the exact product pictured but alas, not quite. I ordered this thinking it was an oversized, comfy cardigan I could wear around the house on a crisp day when I had the windows open, but it is actually more fitted then sweater pictured and the sleeves are 3/4 sleeves. They come nowhere near my wrist. The inside is a little scratchy feeling, but it doesn't bother me. On the up side, it is warm, and looks good as a day time sweater for the fall, or around the office."
3.0,"True to size, light “windbreaker” type material, sleeves are a little odd, good length for 5’2”."
3.0,"these boots are okay, and I wear them from time to time. they run a bit bigger than expected. the soles of the boots are strangely made and are not very sturdy...the have a bounce to them when you walk that i dislike...almost rubbery."
3.0,"So I ordered due to the item name and should have read the description closely. This is a random pack of socks, so don’t count on getting the ones in the image. Honestly I’m ok with the random prints - the thing that seems weird is that there is a mix of sizes in the pack. Some seem larger than the others. I picked three random pairs from the pack and attached a picture for reference. Not sure if this is normal. The “wing” in the back seems odd to me - this is the first time I’ve seen these in kid socks. I’ll update my review depending on how they are after washing and wearing for a decent amount of time."
3.0,Cute. But why does it show 2 belts one being black and in red if I only get the red. And why does it clearly says in description black/red??
3.0,This is much too short on me - and I'm short as it is! I can't imagine someone taller than me wearing this comfortably. It doesn't fit properly at all.
3.0,I didn't notice until after i had it on that the white was tinted pink. This looks like the colors bled thru and unfortunately I am not able to return it. It is very comfortable.
3.0,Super cute design but you get what you pay for...ripped near snap as I put it on my baby.
3.0,These earrings are super cute. My ears might be slightly to small as the end of the constellation hangs off of my ear lobe. The earrings do not stay in place correctly.<br /><br />They look much cooler than what they are.
3.0,The charm is a bit large which I kind of like but the strings are long enough to put over your head without opening it; too long for me. Clasps are flimsy also
3.0,"I like this one piece, however the biggest issue is that one of the straps was sewn on upside down, so it ended up useless and will be returned. I'm 5'1-2, 120ish lbs, 32 B, athletic build and ordered a medium. If I could of replaced in time for vacation, I would have ordered up to a large due to the suit having a short torso which pulled my boobs down &/or made them look saggy versus perky."
3.0,The only big downfall of this colour is that after the 3 rd wash its starts fading and show yellow. Nor sure why this happens.
3.0,It’s super cute and it looks nice on. It feels a little cheap tho but for the price it’s good quality
3.0,Some pros and cons.  The material is very soft and a good weight.  Like that it has pockets.  Sad to say the one received was poorly constructed as one side of it was much longer than the other.  It is very obvious in the front. Given the pros am likely to try ordering again to see if there are better results and if perhaps this one was a fluke.
3.0,"Really wanted to like it but just couldn’t. The color and print was really pretty. I got the xxl and it fit with slight gaping at the chest. It hit just below my knees and I’m not even tall. Ref 10/12 bottoms, 12/14 tops, 38ddd, 5’4”.<br />  The material was the worst. Felt like the plasticky nylon used to make umbrellas. Started sweating the second I put it on. Made swish sound when I move and squeaked as the ties rubbed when tying."
3.0,"I got a XXL and I wish I would have another size up. It is beautiful, love the colors."
3.0,"Cheaply priced, already fraying from minimal use but I lose these a lot so works well for me."
3.0,The pads are so thin it's hard to fix and adjust them once you get the bra on.
3.0,Much bigger than described.
3.0,earrings were fomd little large .e not too thrilled with size<br />wrapping not very good<br />gift ard terriblr<br />I will not bu gift ard and wrapping again
3.0,Not exactly what I thought it would be. Overall nice but material heavier Than expected. Thought it would just flow but did not. I kept and do wear but not like I expected
3.0,Beautifully crafted but they are huge!
3.0,"It looks nice, but very heavy"
3.0,"It's nice, but the soft cups are just placed in a holding area, one fell out in the wash.  Easy enough to put back, but it would be nicer if they were sewn in.  Bought for my daughter for camp."
3.0,"I read other reviews seeing that the sizes run small - THEY DO! I ordered a 3/4T for my 1 year old, and it fits everywhere except in the arms. The white little cuffs are VERY tight. I'm having it slightly altered by cutting the cuff and adding a little elastic for some give. Good price for quality, though. Glitter comes off. Can also find this costume at Cosco already (August) for less than what you would pay for product+shipping here. Doesn't include gloves like the one I saw at Cosco either. I'm happy enough with it to bother with the alterations and not send it back."
3.0,It broke off a month later
3.0,"Beautiful glasses, was delivered with one of the lens scraped up :("
3.0,"I bought this dress for a Moira Rose costume and it looks good, but seems to run small in the bust. I'm a 34B and ordered a M, but it smashed everything down. Also, the fabric is VERY thing. Like a plastic table cloth material, so seems a little pricey for the quality."
3.0,Fitted somewhat large. They fall easily and one of them has shorter fur. Don't like them. Doesn't look original.
3.0,Purchased it as an Easter gift for my daughter. She loved it until it broke after 2 days of wearing it.  The slip know that allows it to be adjustable came undone.
3.0,"I like this shirt and it fits well. The only complaint I have is the quality of the stitching around the sleeves, it is coming unraveled and the hem is coming undone."
3.0,Does not work if protection screen is on phone.
3.0,Several snags in the stitching on top of the hat.  The stitching is exposed in several places.  I used a black sharpie to camouflage it but I expected better workmanship.
3.0,The bag is not white; it is more like an off white or tan.  Did not like the bag with my white shoes at all.
3.0,"They're not the most comfortable reefs I've had.  The arch is pretty substantial in these (probably for the bottle opener...).  Asides from that though, they're pretty quality sandals.  If I had to buy sandals again, I'd probably go for the phantoms and not these though.  The phantoms (although cheaper) are much more comfortable IMHO."
3.0,Runs small not khaki but mustard yellow
3.0,"Your basic, light blue, made in china light blue sun glasses. Cheap pladtic frames"
3.0,The sizing just doesn't work. The top was massive and it was too long. But the top was very top large but I could barely get my head through it.
3.0,A little hard to hook.
3.0,"I love this outfit,  the shirt is a little small for it to be 18/24months would be my only issue"
3.0,in what color this glasses come?
3.0,I love the idea of a man climbing on my ear. Have yet to find the perfect balance of staying put and not cutting off circulation.
3.0,"Slip is the key word here. Not dress. The material is very soft and silky, and THIN. The length is really short, and if you are curvy of course you know your curves will eat up most of the length. I decided that my slip is now a shirt to wear under other shirts. It's cute, and depending on your level of modesty it could be a slip, or dress. I think it's multifunctional."
3.0,If you have a larger bust you will have to wear a cami underneath if you plan on wearing to work.
3.0,i returned them because they fit some what large
3.0,"I loved the fit of this dress, I am short 5ft and I went with the small and I love it! The only thing I don’t like is that I ordered the off white and it is 110% see through. Looking for a slip or something so I can wear. Might order in a different color!"
3.0,These are cute but a bit short.  The elastic at the ends gets broken easily.
3.0,This shirt is unique in it's color design for any Patriots fan. But very thin which may lead to poor durability with time and washing.
3.0,"I have a lot of hair and this hat allowed me to wear my hair up in a bun/ponytail while still providing shade to my face. However, if winds are high it will try to fly away! Hold on tight to it!"
3.0,"Pants themselves are great, only problem was strong chemical smell when I received pants and still there after 2 washings."
3.0,This shirt fits nice and has a really cute back with buttons. I probably would have given it four stars but the one sleeve is missing the hole for the button (see pictures).
3.0,"These are so pretty. Easy to put on. But, the little diamond part falls off."
3.0,The packaging is terrible it was so difficult to open. There is no sign on the product which says genuine leather. I'm not sure this product is leather it looks like faux letather to me. The color and the buckles are impressive. The thickness is not up to the mark. Overall it is an average product. Thanks for the tool and the spring bars.
3.0,Kept in hopes that I'll lose enough weight to wear; watch out when buying products that are manufactured in China
3.0,"I love the jacket and the size was as expected, the only thing that was disappointing to me was the material. The pics make the jacket look very elegant and fancy but in reality the fabric is cheap looking and easily wrinkled."
3.0,"Normally wear a US size 12. I bought a 12.5 because of the reviews & they fit perfect. So they must run a little small. But main problem is condensation builds up b/tw insole & outsole & if you wear long enough the insole becomes wet making your socks wet (nothin worse). I have over 30 pairs of shoes & I’ve never had this problem w any. Idk if water coming in from bottom when I step on wet floor or what, but it can’t be sweat bc my feet don’t sweat bad & definitely not near enough to make my socks & insole soaked. Unfortunately a waste of $."
3.0,These socks are much thinner than past purchases. I tried to reorder my last purchase but they were not available. They work but….
3.0,It is pretty see threw so you need to wear something the very light colored under it.
3.0,Was heavy for little kids<br />My 5 years old son refuse to wear it he said it is heavy
3.0,"Ugh! This shirt is so cute, but the bottom band is super snug. For reference I am 5’1 and 140 pounds. I am normally between a large and a medium. I went with a medium. I wish I would have got a large. This isn’t super thick sweatshirt material. In fact, the white is actually thin enough to be see through. The strings also frayed terribly when I washed it. I did not dry it, so I cannot attest to shrinkage. The design is flattering, but the shirt is not made very well. I wanted to love this, but unfortunately I do not think it will last"
3.0,Nice boots. Fit my feet but are too narrow in the calves.
3.0,I can bend the visor so it isn't flat versus slightly rounded.  Looks kind of goofy.
3.0,I really like this bracelet. It's very pretty and light weight. When I first recieved it it was stiff.  I was able to soften it with a little manipulation. However the charm that they used was rather large and it broke because it wouldn't conform to the roundness of wrist.  I replaced it with another charm and the bracelet is back to a new favorite of mine.
3.0,It's small and nice just like the picture but it doesnt take in place. It would be great of it could be secured tightly around my nose. It keeps falling out. My use it for my ears instead
3.0,"The fit of the mask was great, as the mask is suitable/large enough for non Asian faces. However, the mask material/filter was not breathable enough; I sweat a lot more with this mask compared to some of the other KN95 and KF94 masks I have."
3.0,It’s cute. But doesn’t look like the pictures. Diamonds aren’t the same as picture
3.0,Disappointed thought it was suppose to be an olive green color n was tan other than that it’s a nice fit for outfit I’m wear at our Christmas party this month. Might want to make sure people know the color they are buying pics are not very good to go by !
3.0,These pajamas run small and they are not soft.  I may be returning them
3.0,"I don't have anything bad to say about these because plenty of the reviews said exactly what I found out when I ordered a couple packs.  These aren't compression shirts, they don't hold your stomach in at all and I ordered a Medium and am 6'5"" tall so two sizes smaller.  They're still great shirts for the price to wear under a tee to keep from sweating through or for the gym.  Just don't order them if your goal is to give a slimming effect because that's not something they do."
3.0,Decent dress for a low price.
3.0,"Fit was good, however I am 5'4&#34; and they are a tad too long."
3.0,"First of all, shipping took FOREVER. I order from SHEIN and wondered why their items come from China as well, but I can receive shipments from them in about a week.<br /><br />I did receive my shacket a few days before I thought I was going to get it. So that was good. First impressions were good- colors were similar to the stock photo (that was basically stolen from Vici’s website), it was soft and looked nice overall.<br /><br />Disappointments- sleeves are short, and shacket should be longer in my opinion. But good thing I’m short, because those 2 items aren’t massively an issue due to my height. But I’d you are tall- this may not be the shacket for you. I’m also almost 5 months pregnant and feeling fluffy, so I’m sure when I’m post baby- I will feel not as bulky wearing this. Lol.<br /><br />I had gotten impatient waiting for this to arrive and I bought a gray and ivory shacket from Nordstrom for $49- quality is obviously top notch and that shacket not only is lined with sweatshirt material, but the sleeves are on point and it has pockets.<br /><br />Sufficed to say- I will prob keep the Amazon shacket since it is not as thick and can be more of an everyday thing than the Nordstrom one. I live in Southern California and it doesn’t get super cold here. But don’t have super high expectations of a boutique quality shacket- it does the job. I also am not sure about returning it since I read a review that says the seller charges $6 to return it. Wtf.<br /><br />Anyways, I hope this helps someone on the fence with this particular shacket!"
3.0,"Cool product but! Too little, like for a kid!"
3.0,"Forgiving style, but rather see through. I'm going to have to wear a black slip with it. But for the price, you can't really complain."
3.0,I like these. I don't like the the white sections of the butt are see through as in you can see the color and outline of my underwear but I should have expected that. Otherwise I like them. I usually wear xl but these aren't as tight and are kinda long on me I probably should have went with a large.
3.0,Comfy material but the blue is very big. I ordered a medium but it fits like a large or even an extra large.
3.0,This Merokeety top is great for warmer Spring and summer wear. The waffle knit makes it light and drop shoulders keep top half loose. The only suggestion I have is the bottom length around the middle is cut straighter so if you have a tummy and don’t like your zippers or buttons to show then wear with leggings or pull on shorts.
3.0,The size small is too large like L
3.0,"It's kinda poofy, kinda makes me feel like a farmer at the co-op, just need some overalls.  Definitely not a lo pro trucker hat. The vinyl decal they pressed on  does not look like it will hold up to a wash and dry, its flaking off a tiny bit already. I am gonna keep it because It looks alright on me as long as I dont wear denim with it."
3.0,Cheap material but cute.
3.0,"The body is good , waist is too small."
3.0,Thinner material than I thought.
3.0,Very tight for the size ordered.  Quality seems appropriate for the price.
3.0,"These are fine, a little small to fit into my bra but they work, the adhesion enemy to if very good.  Will probably reorder."
3.0,"These are supposed to be over the knee socks, but barely come to the knee. Disappointed with the height, but they are cute for knee socks. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't misrepresented by the photo."
3.0,"Ordered a large just to make sure it fit, I'm usually in between M & L. It was a little big on me. Very thin cheap material. Top is cute and silky. Bottoms are stupid, must be high waisted (i didnt read that before i bought it though) crotch is super long and the inseam is like an inch long ahahaha. Super baggy bottoms. I'll probably only use the top."
3.0,"the brow of the hat , front side where the logo sits is too tall...need to be a bit smaller in size"
3.0,"Kind of a strange cut. sit lower than most and hang lower in crotch. Nice, and I've used, but not a fav and won't reorder."
3.0,"Owl is much larger than it appears.  It’s nicely designed, but way too large for me to wear as a necklace.  I will remove it from the chain and  do something else with it."
3.0,Thin and cheaply made. Afraid it will come apart with the first wash
3.0,"The child sized, ordered for my 8 and 10 yo’s fit me (adult with a slightly large head) perfectly. I need to stitch up the loops so my kids can use.<br /><br />I like that there’s an opening for the filter but even the child size still has SO much extra material that the filter takes up less than 3/4 of the space (can’t fathom how huge the adult size must be).<br /><br />The black really absorbs heat. I wish they had lighter colors."
3.0,"I love the Rose Quartz pendent, but the necklace chain is very cheap.  I am using a different necklace for the pendent.  I wish the once sent was of higher quality.<br /><br />Many compliments on the pendent and happy with that."
3.0,"I am curvy, 5’5, 170 with boobs and a butt and a little bit of a stomach, so I looked forward to this dress for work. I did love the first day. Yes, this dress is flattering initially, but stretched after the first wear and the rouching actually leaves a big pouch area on my stomach. This dress is very much like a maternity dress. The fabric is good and the top cut is flattering, just not happy with the large midsection. I might have to get it taken in a bit to continue to wear it. I have worn twice only bc of this problem."
3.0,These are super cute. But I disagree with them fitting women up to 160 lbs. I'm 5'7&#34; and 150 lbs and they didn't want to stay up. I think my height and weight combination were too much for it so I found myself tugging them up multiple times.
3.0,Nice looking clover and the resin is holding up just fine. But the metal on the back is wearing off. Pretty sure it isn't stainless steel...
3.0,"These are really pretty, but they make my ears itch and they turn my skin a little green.  I'm not sure what's in the metal."
3.0,"It was not flattering on me, needed to return."
3.0,I think these shoes would work well for most people but I was looking for a shoes with more space in the toe. I was hoping to find a comfortable and supportive business casual shoe but I don't think this is the pair for me.
3.0,"Bust is too large. Waist had some room and fabric has some stretch so I could size down. im normally a size 12, 155 lbs, 5 foot tall. Measurements are 38-34-46. This dress was about mid-calf on me so I didn't care for the length. It billowed out like a tent on my short frame. The fabric quality could have been better. It has little stretch and felt thin and scratchy. I like that it has a modest V neck but the chest was too big. I could fit my hand inside."
3.0,"I feel like this is great for holding everything in, but it did not give me the intended effect of lifting or enhancing my behind ): Also runs a bit LARGE."
3.0,"I love the color and design but after washing them a couple of times, they've shrunk to a nearly unwearable size. The third wash will likely be the end of the line for them."
3.0,Super cute fit but you can see ALL THE THINGS thru it😬
3.0,"Material is like a 5below shirt, design looks great on the shirt though. Not sure how i like it fitted on me."
3.0,When I opened this I really liked the material it’s a different type of material but it sells perfect for summer and fall and spring.<br /><br />The bottoms are very generous in size however I can see how the waistband is not attached and it can be one of those outfits where it’s just going to twist because it’s already starting to do that. Now this is the issue…<br /><br />I put the top on and I am a 42D and the top in my opinion is a little bit smaller for me. I’m more of a size 18 on the top 16 on the bottom the bottom fit me great and as I said our generation five but because I’m a 42D it is a bit tricky with the top however it still fit and worked I just wished that it covered a little bit more in the back.<br /><br />I put the top on and it was a little tricky. The thing is there’s a longer part and then there is a shorter part of the top the longer part you’re going to put in the front and then the strings tied around your back.<br /><br />So as far as the top being smaller than I would’ve liked the other issue is it is see-through! And I got the black one.<br /><br />I put it on I was in the bathroom and I was looking in the mirror and I noticed that I could see pretty clearly without wearing a bra. So if you’re going to get this make sure that you are wearing a bra with it.<br /><br />I found the material to be unique so I do like that the waistband knowing that it’s already twisting and it’s like that is disappointing and the top needs to be a little bit bigger in my opinion to match up with the bottoms.<br /><br />I have a reverse triangle type of bodybuilding so it’s a little tricky with tops as I said it still overall fit me but just seemed a tad smaller in the top area so keep that in mind if you are chesty like me. Also keep in mind that you are going to want to wear a bra with us and if the back is too short you may have to keep on tugging at your top to cover your bra because I had to do that.<br /><br />I honestly don’t know if this will last long but it’s OK.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.
3.0,pants too long
3.0,Item runs a little bigger than advertised.
3.0,"I thought these were the scratch me not brand, not even close to being comparable. I was very disappointed. My grandson can get these off really easy."
3.0,"The material is nice and feels high quality. It isn't very comfortable though, and the straps are almost too far apart. They sit on the very edge of my shoulders and back, and tend to roll when I move certain ways. The bottom band is also much longer than I expected. I am short, so it actually ends right above my belly button. It feels more like a crop top than a bra, and I wasn't looking for a crop top."
3.0,I love this jacket and white tail products just getting the sizing down has been and issue. Sometimes large is to small and sometimes it’s to big.
3.0,"Fits small across shoulders, but material is soft"
3.0,It was much more coral than pink.  I was hoping for the color in the picture
3.0,"I do like these earrings, the only problem is that they don't sit back on my ear. The end of them stick out so my hair gets caught in them all the time. They would be a great choice to wear when I have my hair up though. They are sturdy earrings so I can't bend them back like I would be able to if they were made cheaply but they aren't. They are still very pretty and look great."
3.0,Bottoms don't fit.  Top is fine except that there is not slot to remove the pads.  Pads that came with it were all squished and rumpling.  The other top I got in a different color had a slit sewn it so it was easy to remove or replace the pad.  I had to cut the material to get the rumpled pad out of the burgandy top.
3.0,Thought there wasn't plastic but you get what you paid for I guess
3.0,OK as a windbreaker and in light showers. But I work outside a lot and got soaked through this within 20 minutes.
3.0,Only thing I'm disappointed with is I ordered gray and this one looks green with brown straps. I expected a gray one with black straps.
3.0,"As time has gone on, the band is subject to disconnect from the watch without much pressure ... and while you are wearing it. Frustrating and poses a risk in terms of damaging the Gear Fit.<br /><br />The only saving grace on this replacement band has been that the buckle is a secure fastener as compared to the button-type fasteners."
3.0,It is alright hold up when the kid remembers he has it  does help keep them DRY
3.0,This dress is picture perfect but it hangs low n da front
3.0,It's a nice top but looks slightly different than photo. It is a lighter gray and is slightly see through.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:417fe598c8724b0043b13ac0010b715b]] I don’t like the space inside it’s very small
3.0,"Nice set of scarves for the price but, they are no where close to being silk."
3.0,I wear an american size 2xl so I ordered a 5xl so it would be more comfy... its more like an American size xl. The pockets are a joke seeing as they are the size of infant mittens.
3.0,"Love the look of these, but they irritate my ears after gong through a full day of wearing them."
3.0,Waist down fits great.  Waist up too small
3.0,Cut but a little see through
3.0,"I am 32dd ,25 waist and 38 hips. I purchased a size small and it was HUGE on me. The measurements do not seem accurate at all. The fabric is decent but wish they carried XS and XXS."
3.0,"There was this weird lump of fabric over the stomach... I can only assume that it was supposed to collapse into some sort of cute folds or pleats? I’m not sure, but it didn’t. It stayed puffed up and stuck out awkwardly to make me look almost pregnant! I returned."
3.0,It fit everything except the chest. I would have needed twice as big of boobs to fill the cups. I gave it to my sister in law who was nursing at the time. It fit her well for the season. Still a good purchase but I'll probably make the effort to go to Target next time.
3.0,"This is going back. I'm 5'9 and 150lbs, and the Small was too big."
3.0,Pretty dress. Good material. Fit snugly. Probably my fault for buying too close to the holidays. Hopefully after a diet I can wear it.
3.0,Beautiful but inconvenient to wear
3.0,"I got the XL for my older son (late 20s) and he liked the sweatshirt and will wear it, but he noted it is cut rather odd (wide width but shorter in torso) so it may shrink in the length pretty quickly."
3.0,nothing extra
3.0,You get what you pay for !
3.0,After only about a week of use the little snap that closes this thing has broken. I don’t even carry that much around with me so not sure why it broke. So I have to carry it in my hand so it won’t open and spill all my stuff out (again). Also within the first few days of use the chain had worm the color off both corners by where it attaches. I still liked this wallet until the snap broke. May just have to replace the snap with Velcro strips or something
3.0,"This was pretty much what I expected it to be. However, it was way larger than I had expected it to be!"
3.0,These look nice but are far less red than shown in pics.
3.0,"Even though it says it's a &#34;one size fits all&#34; it really isn't. I'm usually a medium, but the fit of this shirt is way too clingy. It should be marketed as a small shirt."
3.0,beautiful but low quality
3.0,These are not flattering at all. Based on the reviews I sized up to a large and it looked terrible on me. It made me look old and frumpy. I should’ve gone with the medium which is my usual size. Also the material is very thin. I would return but I already wore one. If you buy buy in your usual size.
3.0,"It was a little small, but worth the price.  It helped to rinse it in cold water,  let it air dry then brush down the sideburns.  Compared to other sites for the same product,  I was happy to find this store.  And it arrived quickly without expedited shipping."
3.0,"It is not 90 degrees. They really need to fix that description. Works as intended to, but requires your head to be tilted a bit (by a pillow or something). Or to put the glasses on the tip of your nose, which would reduce the field of vision, but don't think thats how youre supposed to use it.<br /><br />*not 90 degrees<br />not the largest field of view but is not heavy as other brand"
3.0,Had other colors in Med and they fit good. Got this one and the material is thicker and WAY smaller. Fits skin tight. Very disappointed.
3.0,Love it except arm openings are way too large
3.0,"The cap is useful for extreme heat and sun rays, but it’s way too big and it looks messy. It doesn’t hold properly to the head."
3.0,The golden color comes off very fast
3.0,Very large. Not Danity at all large fat hoops<br />Pretty though
3.0,Beautiful. But unfortunately the silver wears off pretty quickly and the cooper shows thru.
3.0,I normally buy xl and have plenty of room. They are more loke a mediums. The fabric is very soft and has nice color.
3.0,I needed to invest in adhesive in order to attach pads and the cost of the pads was a bit over the top.
3.0,"I scrutinized the photos and reviews before purchasing this tunic. What I received was something close to this, but not the exact same garment. The neckline was not the same as shown in the photos. The edging was much narrower and it was more of a wide scoop neck. It also wasn't quite as flowy.<br /><br />As a tall woman (5'9&#34;, 190 lbs, 38C) it fit well. I almost always wear a size large in tops and that's what I ordered. The fit was good in the shoulders and the sleeves were long enough. The length of the entire garment was a little shorter than I'd hoped. It did cover the bum, but hit above mid thigh and not below as shown in the photos. Sadly, the stitching on the hemline started significantly unraveling on the first wear. Because of that I returned the garment. If I could ensure that what is pictured is what I would receive I would try ordering again, but I'm not taking the chance."
3.0,"I don’t have a picture, but other pictures of the earrings broken is exactly what happened to me. First time wearing them, no issue other than difficulty putting them in. Second time, no issue until I took them out for the evening and accidentally dropped one of them. Broke instantly on regular wood floor. Really loved the style, but unfortunately not as sturdy to accidental drops."
3.0,Love the style runs small afraid to wash
3.0,Supportive but not great for running.  The zipper rubs a little at the bottom of the bra.
3.0,"VERY cute boots as pictured. They fit perfectly and are comfortable. However, the end cap on the bottom of the heel fell off without my knowledge during my 1st time wearing them and caused damage to the heel. I can no longer wear them with a heel that has an open hole on the bottom. I would have loved to exchange them, but there are no more available! So I had to take them in for repair, another $20 for that. Disappointed!  I don't know why I bothered posting a review when people cannot even buy these anymore since the company doesn't even have the inventory."
3.0,"Was too big, even with an ample chest this was too loose and low cut for prom. It’s really pretty though."
3.0,Loved the print and I ordered a size up but it was way too short.
3.0,It was a little too big for my child who wears a 2T
3.0,"They're cheap, thin, and poorly made, but they get the job done."
3.0,Not soft enough
3.0,It wasn't totally what I expected in terms of thickness but love the color and they're super soft. I paired them with a thin black pair I have underneath. I'm from Minnesota so layers are everything.
3.0,"The top fits great, however the bottom was a little small."
3.0,It's very pretty but very gaudy.  One of the stones was detached when it arrived.
3.0,"My shoe size is 5.5 to 6 US standard. These were ok until second wash and then the elastic started falling apart. I washed it with cold water and line dried. It's become somewhat loose now I have to constantly pull it up the silicone backing isn't helping much. It's holding the fabric well, haven't seen any wear and tear even though I've worn it for long hours and walked a good amount of distance. Wish it was a size smaller."
3.0,"Nice embroidery, but the XL was still too small for a size 12-14 young woman."
3.0,"I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring in very high resolution.<br /><br />The bad and very bad:<br /><br />1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.<br /><br />2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.<br /><br />3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K<br /><br />4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...<br /><br />5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!<br /><br />6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this."
3.0,"Cute dress, but not for me. I’m 5’8 138 pounds and ordered a large to get a longer length... and it was still way too short and the cut outs showed too much. Wish I could’ve pulled it off, it’s super cute!"
3.0,Based on the other reviews and images I thought this dress would be more oversized and I did get it in the largest size... it was too tight in the arms and I won't get the use out of it that I was hoping for.
3.0,"It's okay, the material is a little weird and the skirt is super long compared to her other leotards but she loves it. My daughter is 39 inches tall and 34 lbs. She wears a 3T in most things but a 4T in shirts because her torso is a little long. This leo is STRETCHED to fit her. It's being pulled down a little on the top and the bottom is definitely squishing her bum lol I'm going to keep them because she loves them and we got the last rainbow mermaid one but any others I get I will definitely size up to the 5/6"
3.0,I liked it but the top was to small so I gave it to my daughter
3.0,"Holy freaking shoulder pads! Since I didn't buy it to play football in I was able to cut them out and at least look a little less like a triangle, but it still looks weird on top for a small-framed person. There are unfortunate stray color splotches on both the butt and crotch, making it look like you're either an infant who overdid it on avocados or Shrek on his period, depending on which direction you're facing. The dress IS super comfortable, though, and thick enough to not be see through. For $10 I'll still wear it on vacation, because I'll never have to see any of those people ever again."
3.0,"Beautiful and keeps very well time. However, this is the THIRD time I've bought this watch. The bubble crystal would split and fall off with no provocation sitting in my watch box."
3.0,"Bought this jacket for the rainy weather in Thailand, I put water on it on the water literally just fell right off of it. It seems pretty waterproof to me. The jacket zipped up and felt fine, but the sleeves are just way too short on me, I'm not sure if I'm just too tall ( Im 5'9). Rated 3 stars because of short sleeves and because seems like it wont last long, zipper has already gotten stuck twice today."
3.0,"The design is ok, but it didn't work when it arrived."
3.0,The two gir masks were great and as advertised but somehow a happy 3rd birthday mask was sent instead of invader zim! Unusable! Bought these for my kids who are 7 and 10 and they will not wear it! Theyre pretty bummed to be missing invader zim too!
3.0,"You will have to restring the top unless you are a very small person.  I weigh 123 pounds and I am not huge chested, but it still was super tight for me."
3.0,Wallet is good quality watch not so much
3.0,The outer boot is rubber. The upper part is &#34;fur&#34;. The bunny is glued on and is starting to fall off.
3.0,"Pretty material but the straps are gigantic. Had to send back, couldn't even salvage it and I'm really good at sewing."
3.0,"Fits well but the waist is a little too high, for me. Overall a good product."
3.0,pretty but too small.
3.0,Does not exhibit the physical property of true lapis azul. Suspect it's an imitation.
3.0,"Very cute.  For those wondering - the red is VERY bright.  This is not a deep or darker toned red.  The fit is slightly small only because it could really be a bit longer through the torso.  I get it up over the girls enough and it's revealing too much below.  Hello - no one wants to really see that!  The design is smart and very nice, the quality seems great - I've worn it a few times already in the water.  If it was slightly longer throught the body, I would have given it five stars."
3.0,Get yourself something with a little more of a :build: to it.  Consider this hat on the cheaper side of hats.
3.0,"I have been wanting to love this dress, but I don't. The pattern is great, but the fabric is prone to wrinkle. The pockets on the dress create gapping at the top of the pocket near the waistline, which adds heaviness to the look. I am going to add some pleats to the pockets to avoid this moving forward."
3.0,"Not the best wool, has a polyester look and feel to them...save your money."
3.0,The shoes are not true to size. They are a couple sizes smaller than the actual size.
3.0,I wasn’t a fan of this shirt and ended up returning it. The sleeves were really big and the lace stood up in funny spots. It just was not flattering at all on me. The color (light blue) was very true to the picture.
3.0,Too small for a medium but love the logo
3.0,I am 5'2 and this was too long at the knees and too broad for my shoulders.  The material is a bit thin as well.
3.0,"Good quality workmanship.  Bright colors and alright appearance.  Not a normal size ID badge holder.  You could carry a snack in there.  While that may suddenly appeal to you, don't.  It is not that aesthetically pleasing and it is intrusively big.  Don't think that keeping your lunch around your neck will make you sexy to the ladies.<br /><br />It is roughly three times bigger than other badge holders."
3.0,These pajamas are nothing spectacular. They're not extra soft or anything. I feel like they fit true to size. I would say they aren't as vibrant colors as shown. They kind of look like they have wash wear but I guess that's the look. I could find similar at Dollar General or Walmart. I probably wouldn't have bought them if I didn't get a deal on them ($16.09). I liked them enough to keep them.
3.0,PajamaGram was not gift wrapped as advertised. It was delivered in a plastic Amazon bag.
3.0,It's ok for a belt.
3.0,"These glasses were ok they look exactly like pit viper. They look pretty good but they weren’t very durable at all once I got them. I wasn’t impressed with the quality, the lenses were really thin plastic and the arms were really flimsy plastic. Overall I wasn’t super impressed."
3.0,"ok quality, but the sizing is on the small side, go for a bigger size."
3.0,got the wrong product but its cool I still like it
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress but, if you're busty gal and have thick arms, it's too tight. I had to adjust the sleeves by making an encision to have more room. If you're a big busty woman there's hardly any room for the girls, unless you unbuttoned a little and wear a cami underneath. The dress is lined, besides the top problems, it's a very flowy dress and comfortable. I wish they had bigger sizes, I would have bought more."
3.0,I would not recommend this if it's hot and you sweat at night all night. I had to change several times. It is a comfortable pajama dress when NOT sleeping......Good luck with that.
3.0,"They are good glasses for the price.  The bad part is the lenses, they are not close to my face.  Instead you can simply look down without moving your head and you get zero sunglasses.  So the sun bouncing off the ground or water gets no protection from the lens.  This is because the lens at the bottom kind of flare away from face.  I use these to bike and run in and because of the flaring you get wind easily flowing through the bottom.  Some people like this, I just do not.  The best part of these glasses are the price and how easy they are to customize to your head.  You can bend these to get a perfect fit.  Sadly would not buy these again."
3.0,"Great looking bag, but it has strong smell of like moth balls. Not sure it will air out. Even tried febreze, but to no avail."
3.0,"Love the color, but they were way too big for my face! I have a petite face I guess."
3.0,It is a tighter (think skinny jeans) fit than expected.  Not a lot of room in the crotch either.
3.0,The pic is darker than the actual item
3.0,"The shirt fits fine. Around the bust its a little big, but overall it fit fine."
3.0,The opening in the back is REALLY big. From the pictures here it looks like I could be tied tight to avoid that - they can't be. It pretty exposes your whole back and bra. I've yet to were it in public..
3.0,The color is not the same :(
3.0,"I wouldn’t call these fleece lined. I was expecting a thicker fleece lining. They do seem nicely made and weather proof. These are a gift, so I’m not sure how durable they will be."
3.0,"When I read stretchy, I was thinking more like leggings or jeggings. I'm 5'6, about 200 lbs and a size 12 or 14 depending on brand. I got a large. While I can wear these pants, they are tight and the seams are already tearing. So if you're around my size, I would suggest buying something else. I bought these because I needed something quick and cheap for work, so they did the job but when I have time I will go out to buy something better."
3.0,It was okay for the price. I expected it not to be the best quality.
3.0,I love this bracelet the look the style but it too small if u have little wrist then its perfect for you
3.0,Mediocre product. Zipper pull came off on one cube after a few uses. OK for the price.
3.0,It's just OK . my daughter said she will ware it.
3.0,This romper is really cute but too small for me. I'm 5 feet and weight 110  what I should order is a large size. Due to read seller suggestions I ordered medium size is too small and the waist is too tight and high. The good thing is I received it within a week shipped from china.
3.0,"I have a size 10 foot and ordered the largest size. They're just a little bit snug. I still wear them, but can't wear socks inside of them. I'll probably end up wearing holes in the toes fairly quickly."
3.0,To large im pretty sure it runs a size Bigger
3.0,It’s decidedly red. I forgot to return
3.0,"Very tight in the shoulders, and very full in the bottom.  Not a good fit for me"
3.0,"it works but its not adjustable in the sense that once its in it looks pretty wide, unlike the cute snug look thats trendy right now. especially for those of us with deviated septums lol cute to try out"
3.0,"Since it arrived rolled up, the visor is rippled. I laid it under heavy books and it is better,  but slightly rippled. I will keep it, only because I need to have one to use."
3.0,"I want to love it.  I think it is super adorable.  It fit as expected... So many things going right!  It just feel uncomfortable after a while and I can't pinpoint exactly why, except maybe the material.  If you're going for style, buy it.  If you're going for something you can throw on an ignore, maybe keep looking."
3.0,too samll
3.0,"I wear these zipped hoodies alot around the house to do housework, or work in the yard.  The pockets tore off of them rather quickly, where my other (name brand sports company) hoodies are all in great shape.  However, it was inexpensive, it does what it was designed to do, and it is still in my closet to be worn when I do house or yard work in cooler seasons.  If you can sew those pockets on better, it would have gotten 5 stars."
3.0,"These necklaces are cute, but you get what you pay for. Some broke within a few days. You have to be super gentle."
3.0,Get what you pay for. Mine fog up in cold weather when plowing snow w/ my utv.
3.0,"Nice quality, but OHHHH SOOOOO SNUGGGGGG... was taking a chance to get something not quite so tight... alas, I’ll keep looking.  This one’s most definitely BODY REVEALING... great for a tiny body, not mine.  The XXL fit my size 4 daughter in law... YIKES...."
3.0,I got this to wear for pictures but I felt like it looked kind of boxy on my hourglass shape. It might be better suited to other body types.
3.0,These are really silky and smooth.  I had a problem that they were so smooth that they just fell off.  Nothing to grip to your body with.  I hated them and returned them.  So glad they are not in my life anymore
3.0,Very low quality.  Cheap material
3.0,Be careful! The lanyard isnot long enough to ctick into pocket while running! But v pretty!
3.0,"Just looking at the dress, a couple of seams puckered at the front.  But it was pretty."
3.0,I was not expecting this dress to be ribbed more like an undershirt or that of a tank top. The cut and feel of this dress is like an extra long tank top. The fit is fine and it's sized correctly. I wouldn't have purchased if I would have known that It would feel like a ribbed tank top and is a little scratchy.
3.0,Really small. And hard to put the ball in
3.0,Too small for a U.S. XL again great looking shirt really love the styling
3.0,"Jeans themselve are cute but run EXTREMLY small. I  wear a 14 and ordered a 3x which fit me like a medium depsite the soft material and light stretch,"
3.0,"This is okay for a costume but definitely is not acceptable for anything else. The fabric is very thin, rough, and see-through. I typically wear a 2x and bought the 5, it's not uncomfortably tight but there is no give anywhere. I don't feel like I could wear this as-is, I need to layer it with other things."
3.0,"This is a nice pattern hanker chief, however it is rough.<br /><br />The pattern on this handkerchief is really nice. I ordered it for myself… We try to minimize paper products we are using. For instance we use clock diapers and reusable paper towel clocks. The item does measure to the standards of 9&#34; x 9&#34; – but my main problem with it is the texture of the fabric. It is advertised as being cotton so I assumed it would be a softer material… But it is very rough on the skin. Even after three or four times of washing it the material has not softened enough for me to use on my children. I don't want to use something that's going to leave my nose or the skin under my eyes red or rough as I wipe with it. It feels more like a polyester blend of fabric than cotton.<br /><br />Review by P. Thomas- I received this product for a discount. This is my honest opinion of the item and is not influenced by any discount. I don't  give good reviews just because I received an hour a discount- you can look on my reviewer page to see I give a wide range of 1-5  star reviews.  I am NOT paid to leave reviews. Thank you!"
3.0,"These run small I'd size up one or two sizes.  The hubs is 5'9"" and ~220lbs.  We got the x-large for him even though he usually can wear a large just fine and they are a bit small still.<br /><br />There isn't any brief in them or lining of any kind and the mesh is a bit see through so if your underwear aren't the same color it shows a bit.  The mesh itself isn't nice, it is a little scratchy.  They were better after one wash but still not a silky mesh.<br /><br />The length is about an inch above the hubs knee.  The drawstring works well and the zippable pockets hold keys, wallet or phone secure.<br /><br />The two pack of shorts is cheap though at $15 per pair of shorts.  If you paired these with compression underwear you might be ok.  As for us my hubs only wears them over his biking shorts and then takes them off when we go biking."
3.0,The cut of the dress is wrong but the fabric is nice.
3.0,The flimsy bill is kind of a Hassel especially when the hat is wet.
3.0,"I like that i can have seersucker for texture and for variation in my sunwear, though note this shirt is rather wide and boxy.  even the sleeves are wide.<br /><br />Mixed feelings.  This seersucker definately benefits from the added privacy of the chest pockets.  I think I will keep but it wasn't all i was hoping it would be, even while i was expecting it to be boxier.<br />I wonder if the added length isn't from any added fabric but from the lack of shape.  when i pulled it in towards my back a little it seemed more like columbias typical length such as if i got it taken in.  (i was looking for a longer option)"
3.0,"They are very comfortable, but I already can tell it won't take long for them to stretch out and can't wear anymore."
3.0,No buttons<br />Fits fine<br />Cloth is okay quality
3.0,"The flannel part of the shirt looks and feels good, but the black part of the sleeves and hoodie are poor quality. The black material decreases the quality of the material and makes it look cheap. It depends on what you want it for. Definitely not worth $30."
3.0,okay top but the fabric is a little too thin.  You have to wear a tank underneath.
3.0,I ordered so I'm 180lbs and 36DDD. Slightly large under the arms but fits just right every where else.  Decided to keep it and alter
3.0,size was small
3.0,"It’s waaay to big Nd they don’t hang on long at all , very uncomfortable"
3.0,They're sturdy and the clip snaps in securely and holds firmly. All good. The only minus is the locking button on top is absolutely superfluous. It does nothing really. You can still unclip the buckle with the 'locking' button engaged. ...kind of a wasted feature.
3.0,These are nice but it will take some time to break them in.
3.0,Wouldn't recommend.  Looks like but doesn't stay latched.
3.0,"I loved the watch but i bumped my waist on a chair at church and it broke, so I only got to wear it once."
3.0,The product is good it just gets dirty super fast.
3.0,It was okay. Its not exactally what i expected but it would be fun to wear before sex.
3.0,Its too tight in the chest area. Smashes my breast and thats not sexy at all.
3.0,really cute. flimsy
3.0,I thought the bag was smaller but it is to big for my son. It actually fits like a medium backpack
3.0,Not modest enough for little girl
3.0,"I like these, but find they may have too much flexibility and stretch so much that zippers do not close well.  Some shorts have been just fine with these, but too much flex for jeans and some pants."
3.0,These clog mule sandals are heavy and clunky but kept them since the little girl is a huge Frozen fan and she doesn't seen to mind clunking around.
3.0,Slightly on the small side; I went up a size. Looks great on but the first time I washed it the edges of the bikini started to fray.
3.0,Gave it to my daughter who loves wine. Very cute but much smaller than it appears in the ad
3.0,"The print is fantastic but the size is small. It's more like a pocket square. I use it as a knot sash on a purse. It's beautiful and the print is unique and the colors are great but it's not big enough to be a head wrap, scarf, neckerchief, etc."
3.0,Really needed a Red cardigan not this color.... Completely off in color and not Red! XXL for oversized fit... I think the xl would've worked it's really oversized.
3.0,"A good tie, have used it a couple of times already"
3.0,True to size. Love the cloth. Doesnt feel cheap.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After first wash it shrunk. Still fit me but a tad smaller. Im worried that after a few more washing itll not fit me anymore. So gave a star from 5 to 3
3.0,These do not fit over glasses. They are very nice so I gave them to my granddaughters.
3.0,The loop part that holds the band down broke.
3.0,"I liked this dress, it a cute dress made with a T-shirt type fabric. I wanted to buy another but this was the best color. It’s very low I had to tack"
3.0,Loved the shirt... color and design but wasn’t true to fit... runs small
3.0,Was much shorter than the one pictured. I wanted it to fit long but it is actually cut short in front and longer in the back.
3.0,"The quality of the shorts is great but I ordered a large and they are tiny !! I’m 5’9, 150 lbs and the large wouldn’t even go over my thighs. Crazy sizing."
3.0,waist fit great. Super tight on the thighs
3.0,"Very cute. Silver colored coating wore off and turned my fingers green and they were so tiny that only one could fit on the top joint of my pinky. Came quickly, packaged well."
3.0,"Great look, love the style. Yet this is my 3rd pair and they have cracked at the bottom frame below the lense. I reordered 3 times now and same problem. I guess I will find a new manufacture. Wish it didnt haooen. love them."
3.0,"The quality seems nice, but they were far too long and dragged the floor. They did fit in the waist/rear. Beware if you are in the short side, these will run baggy in the legs and long in length."
3.0,The style is okay but it fit a bit big and the material is thin so I'll have an issue wearing it without a spanx as I do have cellulite. If you're cellulite free then you're good to go
3.0,"I received the 12 Puritest Ponchos One Size Fit All with Hood today.  I could not wait to open them as we go to the High School football games we have a granddaughter that is a cheerleader.  In South Louisiana you never know what type of weather we will have.  They came in individual foil bags 4 pink, 4 blue and 4 yellow.  The colors are really nice and vibrant.  The ponchos are very thin they feel like the cheap garbage bags you buy at the dollar store.  I did not take out each poncho to check for tears.  If there are any tears I will update later.They will be a one time use.  Which is ok for the price I paid for the Puritest Ponchos One Size Fit All with Hood.  I have received the  Puritest Ponchos at a discounted price or free for my honest and unbiased opinion"
3.0,So... I really do like this belt and price point. The problem is the wear... as in - it wears down very fast and I have to buy a new one way more frequently than I would like. But I DO keep re-buying it because I like it so much... so do with that what you will!
3.0,"Muy hermoso disfraz pero tela muy frágil,"
3.0,Not as big as was advertised. Also the Belt it is paired with as &#34;also bought together&#34; does not fit the buckle/
3.0,"I’m 5’7” 125 lbs and I got a size M=US(S) which fit ok. The waistband is a little tight so it looks a little unflattering. The material is nice not too thin not too thick, also the buttons unsnap all the way up to the waistband which I love. However, they were not long enough so I wouldn’t recommend these to women 5’6” or taller."
3.0,"Black faded after one wash, looks almost grey."
3.0,"I have gone through at least two earring backs because the ones that it came with do not stay on. Otherwise I love the earring, I have sensitive ears and have had no trouble with these."
3.0,Love the top- very comfortable. Bottoms are huge in comparison... will match tops with different colored bottoms
3.0,"It is worth the price for a fold up backpack, but after a month or so of use, the straps are starting to tear off.  I'm not carrying heavy weights, but I use it when I walk to the store.  I gave it a three because that is my honest opinion, it isn't bad, but I'm not thrilled with the backpack either."
3.0,Runs small. Otherwise good but would use for kids under 5.
3.0,looks okay
3.0,great product....I may have ordered too small
3.0,Good cute jeans. I forgot that I'm not a size 5 anymore so they were too small. Am ordering the size 7 because they're just that good.
3.0,"The top portion was too large and seemed misshapen.  I would have to alter it to fit small frame if at all.  The fabric is thin, but the pattern very pretty.  I wore it as a skirt with the top tucked folded under.  I actually received compliments on the skirt.  It was comfortable.  I bought an extra small.  I'm 5'2 and 32B on top.  The skirt was a perfect length for my height which was to the ankles."
3.0,I absolutely love the look of this book but I am very sad as it is way narrow in the toes.  I do not have wide feet at all so it makes me sad I will have to most likely return them as I bigger size will not help as they fit perfect all other ways
3.0,"This skirt is constructed well and made to last, but it is not flattering at all. I don't know if it is the cut or what, but the skirt will ride way up and it just looks bad. it is thick material so when it rides up, you will look like you have a very big waist. I have a small waist and a larger bottom/hips than this skirt can accommodate. I don't have the 'gap' that occurs when this is the case. Instead, the skirt rides up making me look like a marshmallow--totally shapeless (unless round is a shape, but it's not my shape!)."
3.0,Too small.  Also the hem isn’t low enough. I like a hem at or below the hips. This hit above the hip and my stomach sticks out beneath it<br /><br />Returned.
3.0,fit snugger and smaller than my daughter had hoped sizing is not comparable to other things the same size
3.0,"These are beautiful earrings.  But I found them to be just too heavy.  They really pulled at my earlobes, so I will probably give them as a gift.  Just too bad because they're so pretty."
3.0,"One part of the listing for this shirt indicated that it is 100% cotton which was one reason I ordered it. Down below in the listing it shown to be poly, which is correct. Otherwise it is a good quality product."
3.0,"Okay, I really should have believed the reviews. Like others have said it really is just mesh and string, but that’s not to say it’s not cute! I got a lot of compliments on it, but I did have to be constantly aware of a nip slip. It’s also tiny, so I would not recommend for those with a larger chest."
3.0,This necklace is OK.  Is made pretty cheaply.  Was twisted when I received it.
3.0,"I love PJs!  But in the summer it gets too hot, but then with a/c it gets too cold.  I'm never comfortable sleeping; however, with the Selene Women's Sleeveless Straight Pajama Jumpsuit Lightweight Nightwear Romper I have found the solution.  The fabric is super lightweight and soft.  I received the large and it slipped right on and was roomy, but it wasn't too big where I thought it would just fall off.  They are capri length so your legs are warm when the a/c gets too cold, but the spaghetti straps keep you cool when your blankets at night are too hot.  This is basically a summer union suit.  It's easy to get off so going to the bathroom is not an issue or huge production.  This is a great idea for PJs!<br /><br />The downside is that I'm fearful for the quality.  The stripes are not lined up properly or exactly so they are really off in the front.  So it has a sloppy, hurried finished appearance and that is disappointing because it was hitting so many marks on what I like in a PJ.  I prefer a luxe look and feel to my PJs, but I don't want it to be fussy.  So, I like easy, comfy PJs, but I choose those that also have a luxe look.  Since the finishing was so off, it had that I just threw on a old t-shirt for bed and called it a day look.  And that made me sad.  So only 3 stars."
3.0,It was too long and big. I may try a medium as I really like the style
3.0,The shirt was a bit to wide and the pocket openings droop down. But it is very comfortable!
3.0,Pretty bra and appears to be well made. a bit too small for me. I ordered a 36E and this MIGHT be a D
3.0,Earrings are beautiful and ornate - I cannot wear them however because it would look like I was wearing a pair of child's earrings. They are also too small to be worn with long hair as they would not be visible. The hooks are so tiny they will require a plastic stopper to keep them from coming out. Wish I had found them in an a larger size perhaps with a lever back that would have been more proportionate to me.
3.0,"Looks nice,a little smaller than I thought. It's a gift for my sis, hopefully she will like it."
3.0,These earrings are very small----child size.
3.0,Too long too tight
3.0,only safe on rough surfaces
3.0,Not as flattering as picture shows.
3.0,not recommended for long term use
3.0,"These are very cute, but I wish the posts weren't so thick. They are a bit difficult to put on, and feel uncomfortable for the first few minutes. (The material is silver plated brass.)"
3.0,"Bought for a gift. It is HUGE, very plastic-y quality of the pant material and bow. The onesie will fit maybe a 9-12 month old but the quality and the lettering seem ok at least!"
3.0,"Was the wrong size, but good quality."
3.0,It's cute but ran too small. Isn't very stretchy
3.0,Very pretty.  But it is bendable.  Not worth the price they charge for it.
3.0,"I have worn these only a few times since I bought them several months ago. They are really fun, and I get compliments when I wear them. But I was disappointed at first because I was expecting denim. They are more of a heavy gauze fabric, and the color is more of a teal than denim-blue. Also, they hang a little strangely in the crotch area."
3.0,"Very nice,  but even smaller than expected.  I am a large and the 2x was very snug."
3.0,Tutu bundles up. Child loved it.
3.0,"Very Morticia Addams. The shoulders are more prominent than in the photo, so it has a general V-shape sensibility to it. It is exceedingly long. I cannot think of an occasion where it would be appropriate, so I wear it at home. I find it amusing. It basically functions as a high-end caftan. If I were  savvy with a sewing machine, perhaps I could alter it so that it works for a very nice evening out. I'm talking Embassy party. The material is a lovely heavy weight. There's just something off about it. I tried blaming my hips, but failed. It is true that if you are long and slender, you will have a very different experience with this dress. Just know, this is not a casual dress. It's got that high-end feel to it. I could never where it to work or to the beach."
3.0,"Very simple....straps are too narrow  (1/2""), waist straps could be longer (it is 24"") enough to be tight in the front. Was not what I was expecting, looks cheap, especially for the selling price."
3.0,It is fun to wear casually.  Since I was a little girl I have been attached to the map of our world.
3.0,"The sleeves are NOT belled like the pic online, other than that it's very nice. Most companies today make the ads look much better than the product! Disappointing!!"
3.0,Just as expected nothing more ..
3.0,Cute dress.  A little tight in the bust area.
3.0,The waist line ends up under my breast!
3.0,"These are not well made. They look cute and the foot is comfortable. The 3 stars is for other reasons. First these aren't good for just using side zipper after the initial lacing. They will need to be lossened each time. Plus, it's quite a chore to get the lacing right. Each time. They feel like cardboard on your calf once on and tied. I kept feeling a scratchy feeling everything I walked. Plus you can feel the unsturdiness in the boot in the ankles. They will also not hold up for regular wear or rain. I think with minimal wear on nice days, you'll get some use. They look cute with skirts or dresses. If you have bigger or muscular calves, there's no way you'll wear with leggings or skinny jeans unless you get longer laces. Foot fit is as expected."
3.0,Smaller than I hoped for. Very thin.
3.0,Looks interesting but cracked on the second day (didn't fall but just cracked during carrying in a pocket). Wouldn't buy it again
3.0,G [d
3.0,The pockets on this are just weird. They are deep and fling but protrude in a way that adds too much bulk to the hips. I returned it.
3.0,Thought it was more thicker<br />Very soft<br />Kept slipping of off my baby feet
3.0,I was unable to adjust size to fit my wrist
3.0,Too big for my taste and didn’t really like the style. If you’re looking for a big handbag this may be for you.
3.0,"Seems well made, and great value IF it fits.  Sizing recommendations are way off, and these are cut more for child-like proportions even in the bigger sizes.  My daughter is a curvy grown-up figure—128 lb, 5’1”, long legs, shorter torso.  According to the chart, her bust/hip measurements would fit a big girl/adult large.  I ordered a medium, based on another review that fit a large.  The medium was way too big!  We need this for dress rehearsals this weekend, so I don’t have time for trial and error.  Back to Capezio we go!  Good thing there was one for a comparable price that arrived in 1 day.  Photo shows how much wider Dipug is versus Capezio medium (which fits my daughter beautifully!). The length is comparable, but the dipug is almost 2 inches wider at the waist on each side, so with double layers that would mean an additional 8 inches in the waist!  If you need the additional width/fuller figured in ladies, this is a great option.  But if you need something for an athletic, grown-up-figured dancer, stick with Capezio or similar dancewear.  (I can’t speak for the children’s sizing.)"
3.0,LOOKS BETTER ON SITE THAN IN PERSON.THE GOLD COLOR IS NOT AS VIBRANT AND MORE DULL IN PERSON.
3.0,Runs small and tight. I dont know about high impact. More like medium and a half impact.
3.0,"Although I didn't like it on me, it was well made and I received a prompt credit from the vendor"
3.0,Like the variety of color.
3.0,"I bought this for my average size teenager and she said the skirt was child size and the headband was too big. We didn't end up using the costume this year. If we do, we will have to reconstruct."
3.0,Only worn a couple of times.  Never got it wet and the magnets already fell out
3.0,Should have gotten the next size smaller...Ann C.
3.0,Pretty and lightweight. Ran big.
3.0,Chain was alittle short for my liking but easily fixed buy going out and buying a new one. But it's very cute and I like the product a lot!
3.0,"By the end of the summer the seam at the toe was really worn after regular use at the pool and beach, I expect my son's toe would have poked through soon. OK for kids since they will probably outgrow them, but I wouldnt get an adults version."
3.0,Okay so the actual fit of the dress wasn’t bad and the material was actually pretty okay. But if you want it to look like the model I would suggest ordering up a size to give it that off the shoulder look. I looked like an auntie and y’all know what I mean.
3.0,Very pretty. Just didn’t fit my daughter the best. We went with another option
3.0,"When i order it i was so exited i order two colours ( Pink & Blue ) one for my GF other one for me, my GF she wear it after few days was broken -_- i expected to be more stronger and high quality that what it was !!!! but mine still ok not broken yet !!! i better go for original glasses than the other !!!"
3.0,Looks better on model. Not flattering. Cut straight across on bottom
3.0,I wasn’t amazed by the turn out but it did it’s job. I wish it provided more of a lift. But it did make sure my nipples were covered.
3.0,This dress is definitely see through.  You can't wear it unless you are putting it over a bathing suit.
3.0,I cancelled this order don't want it
3.0,light weight -
3.0,This dress is cute. I little small and the material is really thin.
3.0,Very thin and see through. Snags easily. Very comfortable though and great color.
3.0,The shoe looks good but is definitely for a child with a wide foot.  My son has a wide foot but this shoe is even a bit loose on him.  The design of the shoe really doesn't allow for you to tighten it.  I would definitely only buy this product if your child has a very wide foot
3.0,Buy a size bigger than you normally wear... Mine were really tight.
3.0,"I do not like it, it has a very thin fabric.<br />I am 5’6 135 lbs I got in M size"
3.0,"It came on time, but when I opened the box the charm said “Mother of the Groom” when I specifically ordered “Maid of Honor” AND one of the little diamonds has fallen off of the bracelet. Don’t get me wrong the bracelet is pretty but the title is misleading."
3.0,Loved the gem ! Just be ever so gentle with the necklace chain as its made of thin but real silver.
3.0,"Pretty costume accent but broke within an hour- could’ve been sewn better. Used a few staples and will fix myself- price was cheap enough, but still."
3.0,What I got sort of resembles the product photos but only slightly. They are pretty poor quality but they aren’t awful. You get what you pay for.
3.0,They sent the wrong colors😢 but I was pleasantly surprised to see these have buttons for mask loops
3.0,"These look a bit cheap and they don't really look ""gold"" as the color is off a bit. They smell heavily of metal and I'm willing to bet they won't last very long. They're for people with smaller hands and don't seem to bend easily.<br /><br />Some of the designs on them are cute but I wouldn't buy these as anything more than costume jewelry."
3.0,"Nice, but wish it looked the same as the others, raised white and black."
3.0,"very comfortable, stylish and su"
3.0,The top half is thin and somewhat transparent. The bottom half has a double layer of fabric which makes it less transparent. I found that the length of each section might make it better for someone with a long torso and short legs possibly.
3.0,"Put them on shoes and went for a run. Worked great the first time. Second time they started falling off. Had to wear them around my ankles, which is uncomfortable."
3.0,Very sheer and kinda small so order one size up
3.0,Bodysuit fits fine...but diaper cover was way too big but overall it’s an cute outfit!
3.0,"These gloves are pretty and keep the chill off your fingers, but they're largely decorative. They do have little tabs in the thumb and forefinger tips for using smart devices, but that's a fairly minor perk compared to the drawbacks.<br /><br />First, they're quite light. So good for cool/chilly weather but not a lot of use if it's properly cold. Also, they're thin and unlined, which means if you get them wet playing with snow at all your fingers will freeze.<br /><br />Second, they have exactly zero grip, which makes them completely unworkable for driving unless you have a super-textured steering wheel cover.<br /><br />Third, the tags on the inside of the wrist are positively obnoxious - cut them off immediately or they'll drive you nuts.<br /><br />So, TL:DR: these are great if you just need a quick pull-on to keep the wind off your fingers, but not helpful if you live somewhere genuinely cold or actually need to do anything in them."
3.0,Great quality and super cute for a kid. However I would not suggest these classes for anyone over the age of five or six.
3.0,"Tags inside, which I do not like. The inside color does not match the outside which, it is white. Otherwise they are ok"
3.0,It’s feels like walking on clouds... that’s how comfortable these are.  The only negative is that they break easily after long term use.
3.0,I'm 5&#34;2 110lbs and the small was huge on me.... ended up giving it to my niece but unsure if it's because I'm a small person or it runs large... usually small fits no problem tho
3.0,"i like the shoes, but is not real leather, and is a fake tommy. should not be sold as leather and is not tommy for sure.<br />should be sold as fake tommy and fake leather, this is the right to do."
3.0,I tried to cancel the order but wasn't able to.  It arrive after I needed it.  but it was too small anyway.  It'll go into the Good Will box
3.0,I'm 5ft and 100 pounds. I ordered a size small. It served the purpose but it was not the most comfortable bathing suit. It was tight by the shoulders and tight by the straps at he bottom of the bathing suit.
3.0,Can I please still return this item? It doesn't fit and I have no use for it.
3.0,"Too puffy in shoulders for my petite frame. Otherwise, good."
3.0,It was more of a chalky pink/lavender color rather than the nude/taupe I wanted. Fits okay so far! Just know the color may not be what you expect!
3.0,"Looks like the photo but the sleeves aren’t snug at all which gives you a boxy look when you wear it. Nice to chill around the house but if you want to show off your guns, this makes them look like water pistols"
3.0,"Fits a little snug, can wear around house but not comfortable enough to sleep in."
3.0,"Not like a cotton or cotton blend. Very slippery material. Too cold againt my skin. I have to wear an undershirt. I went a size up, but I feel like I shouldn't have."
3.0,"Too warm to wear around the neck continuously in summer sun. It's a bit tight to don and remove every time I use it (have to remove my glasses and earbuds each time I put it on or take it off. In order to breath freely I have to keep adjusting it over my mouth to keep it out of my mouth (continuously have to adjust it while speaking). This is really a toss-up between using this or over-the ear mask. It will be better than over-the-ear mask while in an airplane for my upcoming trip. This item is a bit more expensive than it should be considering the adverse things mentioned here, BUT, it does the job."
3.0,The bracelet was beautiful  but it broke when I put it on .I'd love to have another.
3.0,Fit was as expected.  I wear size 4 and the small fit just fine.  The material was softer and more clingy tban I expected.  It will dofor the purpose for which it was intended.
3.0,The stitching of this product comes loose after a few months of wearing that the sole comes a part. I use crazy glue to stick the sole back.
3.0,Large was recommended to be but they’re too small to zip :( I was really excited for these
3.0,I was a little hesitant on ordering these . I'm making hair barrette and using these as charms on them.  I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived . They are adorable !
3.0,"For the price you can't beat it, fits okay for the most part but a lot of the threads were loose."
3.0,"Cute, but definitely on the small side.  Not really long enough for a cover-up and I'm only 5'4&#34;."
3.0,"I love the fit and the features, but I hate the one color, does the jacket come in ANY other color than BLACK???? Only problem later on after about the 3rd or 4th time wearing the jacket, the zippers stopped working, they SUCK!!!!"
3.0,Not gonna lie....I'm a bit underwhelmed. It fits the watch nicely but the look deteriorates within the first day already. If you have a busy lifestyle and don't have the time to take off your watch every single time you wash your hands I would not recommend this. Even if it gets slightly moist it starts deteriorating...<br />The top layer also comes off at the ends after a few times of pushing it through the loops
3.0,Very cute loved it. The jeans made my 🍑 pop!! Im 5&#34;5 201 lbs n I ordered a 1x n it fit perfect. Only downside is i had to put the hooks on the straps myself which was challenging. Adjusting the straps to be tighter was hard. Please fix.
3.0,"The picture leads you to believe that all the beads are white.  They're only near the fox, the rest are black.  It's still a cute chain."
3.0,I have a small waist compared to my butt and thighs and it was a bit hugging and kinda awkward fitting. When buying this product consider sizing up one. When I​ wore these it made the heart very wide and maybe that was because they mightve been too small but the product itself is worth the price.
3.0,"Returned, runs small."
3.0,"I’m 5’6”, a lot short than I thought, covers to my knees, (yes, I know they are capris but all my other brands go down to my middle of calf)and the legs ride up A LOT, guess you get what you pay for. Fabric is soft, just the leg length bug me."
3.0,"This 2-piece is definitely flattering! However, the design is completely different from what was advertised 👎🏼"
3.0,"I need to reorder, size small to small for me.  I probably need a large."
3.0,"I gave it to a friend, but a smaller maybe teen head, its great. I have a lot of hair, so that's why it was tight.<br />It had elastic in the back, but I didn't have time to adjust."
3.0,i thought it would fit on my head (I'm a 23 y/o average female). it was a little too short. but the kids i gave it to loved them. they were all 4/5 year olds.
3.0,"I liked the look but the product was not very sturdy and the fabric was very cheap quality, you get what you pay for"
3.0,I ordered a 4xl. I like the jacket but I have big boobs and a long torso and this jacket is to short.<br /><br />I live in Maine and needed something warm to wear for outside recess. It is warm.
3.0,"I ordered a size up based on reviews, they are still snug. The fabric is thin not forgiving for a chubby gal. I would never consider wearing these out of the house to exercise or run errands. One pair was not in a sealed package & appeared to be washed based on how the tag looked & possibly worn."
3.0,"This is most definitely not a dusty rose color. It's more of a bright peachy pink. I like the feel of rhe sweater, it is slouchy & knit as expected, but not sure if I will keep it. The color is NOT complimentary to my tastes. If this sweater came in a dusty rose pink, I would keep for sure. Did I get sent the wrong color? Or is this the ""pink"" you have? If so, change the images to reflect that. This color makes me feel... uhm ...15 yrs old, not really ""adult"" shade at all. Too bubble gum pop."
3.0,They’re comfortable and waterproof.  But there’s no fur lining.
3.0,nice but i havent even opened the package and i can see a defect in the finish on the silver
3.0,need to order a bigger size run small
3.0,I wear it as a night gown. Not very practical to wear anywhere else unless you like shuffling your feet.
3.0,"Will be returning. The baby doll stitching hits in a really weird spot above the boobs. Would be cute if it was under. Otherwise not flattering, material feels cheap, but fine otherwise. Runs big. I wear and medium sometimes large and I ordered a small. It was still baggy, which I liked."
3.0,Color is really pale. Whatever hint of deep red or brick color is on the website is not on the shoes. Maybe the color was unintentionally “added” when photographed. Nice style and well built if you prefer the pale tan.
3.0,Cup too big no minimize
3.0,Arrived with the clasp open. Fixed it myself. So cute otherwise
3.0,I ordered this product and received a completely different style. The design I received it kind of heavy and the metal is quite thick. I'm going to return because it is not what I ordered and what I wanted.
3.0,Long but not wide enough.
3.0,Comfortable and fit as expected. I'm 5'7 & weight 140 and got a size medium.
3.0,This hat is great. My son is a big Flash fan. The only problem is I didn't realize it wasn't adjustable so it's a little big for him right now anyway.
3.0,"I ordered the army green in a small and medium for size comparison.  I received 2 totally different dresses!  This is the 2nd time this has happened on Amazon.  Last time customer support said a different vendor will be used for a different size.  Well, I'm not ordering from a different vendor!  I'm sending both dresses back.  The size small is army green, but the material is awful.  It states 95% polyester, but if feels like stiff cotton.  The size medium is a gross brown color, but the material is great.  It feels soft and silky.  Good luck with whatever dress you ladies get!  SO disappointed!!!!!"
3.0,It's a plain hoodie my expectations weren't that high honestly but it take so long to ship I should have just gone to Walmart and Gotten a cheap Hanes ones...the quality isn't that great they're a little thin...
3.0,"It is just ok. The strap looks too cheap and it does not look like real genuine leather, the quality of the zippers is not good either. I think the price is to high for a purse is not leather at all.  As other people reviews I found a little lavender packet inside trying to avoid the smell which it didn't. Otherwise if you are not looking for a leather bag as I was, I think is ok"
3.0,Need other item to link.
3.0,"Very cute and well made.  Impressed w/quality of the fabric.  Got this for a Halloween Costume, but seriously thinking that I will wear beyond that."
3.0,"I bought this to wear to an event.  I love the thought of a jumpsuit.  The top part is not at all what was described.  It is not a one piece deep v neck as pictured or described; it is a cross over type top (see picture).  I really like this outfit.  It is very comfortable and the material is just shiny enough.  If the top were a true v-neck as described I would give this a 5, but as it is the cleavage is too much for my event."
3.0,But now that I've had it a couple of months the blank inside the design is falling off. Jeep headlights are no longer black. The feathers in the arrow are no longer black and some of the grill is no longer black. Frustrating.
3.0,"Not exactly as advertised. I'm on the larger size and this belt barley fit me. It fit, but wasn't the most comfortable while sitting. I recommend just going to your local fat kid store and trying on belts. Yes, you might have to pay a bit more, but you'll be able to get a guaranteed fit."
3.0,These are classy but extremely small. It is not a statement piece but compliments a statement necklace/Neckpiece or brooch very well.
3.0,Way to large - looks kind of silly on
3.0,Cute but was too small due to me being 7 months pregnant.
3.0,"The straps that came with my FitBit broke pretty early on, so I purchased this strap to replace them because I thought the cloth would be more comfortable and would be less likely to tear. This strap was indeed much stronger and more comfortable for me, but, even though I've kept it out of water, the glue holding the strap together recently came undone. The strap is not sewn together at all, so while the fabric itself is holding strong, the entire thing is no longer attached to the hardware. I'm disappointed, but am wondering if I've gotten what I paid for."
3.0,Always order one size up. Doesn't look as cool as the picture. Sowing is falling apart at the arm seams.
3.0,I have a large bust (36J) and this dress was too large on the top. I have a 28 inch waist and the dress was snug in the midsection. I got a large.
3.0,These are very small to wear if you have to talk at all
3.0,I liked this dress but there is zero stretch in the fabric which means the straps don't always stay up and it is very thin. I had to search hard to find a slip that was short enough that it was above the lace cut out but low enough so that it could still compliment the low back of the dress
3.0,I'm giving it a 3 star. Their dress was very beautiful. But trying to send it back is a nightmare.
3.0,Kind of cheap looking. The shoulder detail doesn’t lay flat.
3.0,"They were awesome and I LOVED wearing them...but then after a couple of uses, they just stopped holding up. Now, if I try wearing them, they constantly just detach and I end up on the floor searching for an earring. Too bad, though. These would be awesome if they had better quality. Mine also didn't glow...I left them out in the light and did everything I could but despite my efforts, they were glow-less. :("
3.0,"These skirts could have been good for me if I had ordered a size up. The colors are really nice (I got black, charcoal, purple, & teal) and as pictured. I normally wear a medium so that’s what I ordered but I’m a couple months postpartum right now - probably need to be honest with myself that I’m a large or xl for the time being! :) That being said, the mediums were totally see-through on me since they were too small for me and very snug around the bottom. Length was great with folding over or hiking up the waistband. I think given a bigger size the sheerness might not have been a problem. For reference, I’m 5’6”, 160lbs that is mostly congregated around butt and belly."
3.0,I love how it fits and how light it is but it tore after wearing twice.
3.0,They are flimsy and the posts bend.
3.0,Eh. I kept reading the reviews because I wasn’t sure and I should’ve followed my gut because for an XL this is a joke - it should be XL even in the butt and thigh areas . Not just the chest area. Actually ironically that’s the only comfy part of this whole outfit — the black top part. I really wanted to use this dress for my bday dinner coming up but I guess I’m gonna have to search again. Oy vey
3.0,"Buying PRC products is like supporting slavery since the people have no human rights in China. Returned item. Please be xlear on contry of origin, Amazon. May God have mercy on the people of China."
3.0,"They’re a little on the cheaper side, and they side off my nose every once in a while. They do an okay job at protecting my eyes from the sun. I ordered them in brown but they came looking more black. I like how they cover up my entire eye and my eyebrow. I would buy them again if I had to. They’re affordable."
3.0,very good quality material but fit much larger then i expected.
3.0,"While this is very nice looking, it falls off all the time if rubbed against something!  Falls, off while putting on clothing, seat belts etc.."
3.0,Opening too small. Always struggling to get inside.  Heavy.
3.0,The name chain necklace I received was not adjustable.  Was very disappointed as this was a gift.
3.0,the dress looked like the description and fit well but was very voluminous and would've been much better on a  tall person. also the material was very creased.
3.0,Love the way it looked but in the first 15min (already off to work & couldn't turn back) the soul of the shoe fell off & I tripped on it.  Thankfully they took it back.
3.0,The stitching on the seems came out after first wash
3.0,They arrived with one charm missing from the gold bracelet.
3.0,"Ok so the body fit well but not flattering for larger breasted women. Maybe if it wasnt a v-neck... I'm sad it didnt fit well and I will have to return it because it was a very nice dress, very soft."
3.0,"Product looks a lot cheaper in person. More of a young girl shimmer on the band, instead of the leather effect. Overal still a decent product, but not quite what I expected! Will still use."
3.0,"This item is not what it appears to be on the site. The material is cheesy,  it’s only printed on one side.  On the site, it appears to be almost a batik print, but in reality, it’s not. It’s thin and staticky.  It’ll pass, but really disappointed, not what I thought I was getting at all."
3.0,"You can't see well through the lens, you can actually see the flag but otherwise a cool pair of sunglasses!"
3.0,"It’s honestly a beautiful dress, however it was too tight! I’m 170 5’3 and normally wear a large in dresses, I thought it was semi stretchy from what I read in other reviews, it is not. It feels stretchy but it’s that hard rough material. Didn’t work for me, plus glitter gets everywhere"
3.0,"All four earrings came; they came in teal, black, red, and crystal clear. Only two pairs came with the piece to secure it in the earlobe. Some rhinestones were in the bag that fell off and the black one came detached, however, it’s easy to reattach. Very classy but I don’t think they will last very long."
3.0,"These were cute, but the colors were hard to tell apart. I am not even certain I got any for January."
3.0,Love the material and fit.  The green was much brighter than I anticipated and I probably would not have ordered them
3.0,"so here is the deal, its a very small metal plate, about 4 inches or so, ie: not to scale, made for a small child, the sellers/amazon should really get this product description updated to specify that, as the description stands right now is misleading and not fully representative of what the product is, its a nice item but i was disappointed when i got it due to the size."
3.0,"I like the top, it looks cute on. But the material is a little thinner than I was expecting. It's not the best quality of material but it fits my needs so I will keep it and wear it."
3.0,Super cute and works okay until the kid stretches it....loses it's elasticity pretty quickly.
3.0,"I purchased these for my daughter’s headshots. They came in individual packages with a piece of card stock paper, for gifting or resale purposes I guess. The sequins were wrapped around the hoops and held by some type of pliable material. Some of the sequins were coming off, unwrapping from around the hoop. Every pair but one has this defect. The pair that I needed, I took them and pinched the sequins back together around the hoops. These aren’t something that I’d recommend anyone to wear for fashion purposes because of the quality. They looked good for a straight on headshot with big hair covering half of them."
3.0,Rather thinner than expected & smaller than expected. Had to give it to my granddaughters instead of intended person.
3.0,This is a nice jacket but it runs smaller then the size it claims to be. My husband still likes and decided to keep it so it can remind him to lose weight.
3.0,"Very cute. But the color isn't quite as pink as the picture.  That is a little disappointing.  Otherwise, very cute."
3.0,Looks great but broke
3.0,Have these on my key chain and the paint is already starting to peel and scratch up.Arrived on time but idk if I'd buy them again. Would probably take my chances with another brand.
3.0,I ordered X large.  Fit a little big. I'm 6ft and 220 lbs.
3.0,This was very nice But the silver tone faded showing the copper in about 3 weeks.
3.0,"This was not true to size. I liked it when I got it, but it isn't holding up as well as I would like."
3.0,"Don't really know how to rate this product. It was good quality however, it would not stay in place. Returned for a refund."
3.0,The skirt waist line don't strech wide enough extra tight but overall gorgeous.
3.0,"These are super cute. I ordered the army green and wine red (the style with the two long white stripes across the center). My normal sizing is Large so that's what I ordered. And while they did fit, they were pretty tight. Especially the waistband that gave me major muffintop if I didn't wear it at my exact waste...if I did that, the skirt was too short for my liking. So it's not really tight in that it runs small, but moreso that it's meant to be more form fitted with a slight flare at the bottom. I am personally not comfortable in form-fitted clothing so I ordered the XL to compare. The XL came and they are SO much more comfortable and what I'm used to feeling like in large-size skorts--especially the waistband...but...because it's meant to be more form fitted, the upper stitching is very puckered on an angle going one way before the first stripe, and puckered on an angle the other direction inbetween the two stripes. So it just makes the skirt look overall wrinkled. Material is like a soft, springy, stretchy polyester. So while the large LOOKS better, the XL was more comfortable. Since I'm using these for a Disney trip, comfort is more important to me than looks. Overall these are great and you really can't beat the price for a cute skort!"
3.0,"It’s okay but the push out of cards is not very good.  Maybe if it pushed from the ends (like the insert shows that came with it), it might work better.  I tried 10 cards and had to reduce to 5 to make it work for me."
3.0,Nice reasonably priced boot for winter wear. I am not sure how it will fare in the rough and tumble use of a six year old on the school playground.  I will post a follow-up in a couple of months.
3.0,"Very high waist, daughter wouldn’t wear due to discomfort of that"
3.0,"Its not a perfect fit even though I sent in my measurements. The bottom belt is loose, the train is not as long as pictured and the slit is awkward. I'm going to have to take this in for alterations. For the most part, the dress looks as pictured."
3.0,"The elephant on the necklace is super small, but it is a nice necklace."
3.0,"They list sizes as Small, medium, large, but when it arrives, there is an actual SIZE in it.  Because of the S/M/L listing, I was expecting more elastic (one size fits a range of sizes).  The small was a size 4 when it arrived, but I had ordered it for someone who was a size 0-2.  We were able to alter it to make it work, but I do wish they would have used actual sizes in the description."
3.0,"I just received this product. I ordered a medium as a normally wear a medium, but it was really tight especially on my cheat. I recommend going a size up of you have a larger chest. For reference I'm a 36C."
3.0,I like the shirt but it fitted too snug for my liking unlike the picture displayed.
3.0,"It’s a beautiful dress, I love everything about it, BUT the size. :( I sized up and it’s still too snug for my liking."
3.0,"Purchased this bracelet as a gift for an 11 year old girl. It came with a nice purple felt pouch and had multiple loops for sizing adjustments. She loved it. However, it broke with 2 days of wearing it. Not sure if this is due to the construction or snagging on whatever she may have come into contact with. I expected a bit longer wear out of it."
3.0,It’s okay. It’s snug and not light. It doesn’t fit like a loose t shirt like in the photo. The material is like swimsuit material. Disappointed and returning it
3.0,The quality of the finish has details
3.0,"I took a chance on this shirt because it was so cute (in botanical print) but it was unfortunately too large. I typically wear a small or extra small, and I'm 5'5&#34; and 110 pounds. I was swimming in it. It will be going back, much to my disappointment. If it starts coming in sizes instead of one size fits all, I'll buy again."
3.0,"I'm not sure what to think about this dress. I purchased it for work but the fabric is extremely thin and not appropriate for an office setting. It is also very cheaply put together and not sewn very well. Be aware, it will show every fold your body has."
3.0,Way short in the back and tight in the chest. I usually buy xl everything but with this could have went up a size or two
3.0,"charm came on time and beautiful. Fits the original Pandora chain, but it doesn't screw in like the original charms. After wearing for 4 months, it started to change color and cleaning it didn't bring it's silver color and shine back. I wouldn't buy again, but it was good while it lasted"
3.0,I purchased and extra large. I am a 36 DD and would have thought that should have had better coverage. But I do like the design and wish it was a little bigger.
3.0,it is very pretty.  It is super super long.  I have to either find somebody to hem it or wear it all the way up to my chest to keep from tripping on it.  Not meant for short people.  I am 5'3&#34; tall.
3.0,"Love these books. They run a bit small so size up if your in between sizes. The company however, is not good at responding and will not do exchanges. There prices change drastically and they were not willing to do an exchange. They made me return the item and re-purchase in the larger size even though the price went up $10 after I bought it. I will buy other boots because of this. Not easy to work with."
3.0,"Nice idea, good verse but to fit it on the pendant has to be written so small you can hardly read it!"
3.0,not as cute as in person
3.0,This was the shoe style I had been looking for but the toe box was too tight.
3.0,"Way too tight to get on easily. I bought 2 of the XL’s for me and the wife. She can’t get them on, I have to force them on and it’s difficult. But when on I love how they feel."
3.0,"The shirt is super cute and looks like the picture.  However, it was just too big.  I ordered the small and I was swimming in it."
3.0,"WARNING: The posts on these earrings are thicker than standard earrings. For earring wearers used to regular-thickness earrings, these will hurt to wear until you're used to them. There's also screw points on the ends that are especially painful to put in and pull out for first-timers. I wish I could wear these more because I really like their look but the soreness it causes me is too distracting"
3.0,I like the bag. Good for the price 👍. Smaller than I expected. Good to Carry a few items. Canvas look. It's ok.
3.0,"I hate this sticky type of material. It tends to get marks on it that don't come off. I don't know why.<br />And why the heck is RM facing away from the camera, lol?"
3.0,Cute but it looked like it is a laminated picture on a thickish plastic charm.
3.0,The neck feels a little tight. Collar is not real comfortable. It is warm and fits well.
3.0,"I reeeeeeeally wanted to keep this but just trying it on my daughter the sequins came undone because the stitching on the bodice isn’t done very securely.  The neckline is a bit low for my liking but other than that the dress is really gorgeous.  Hopefully the seller will work on improving the craftsmanship, because it would be the perfect tutu!"
3.0,Material a bit too rigid and stiff.
3.0,"The positives:<br />High quality fabric<br />Soft<br />Beautiful color<br /><br />The negatives:<br />Runs smaller than I antnicipated- I think it’s sized to be more fitted<br />Shorter than I expected- I was hoping for more coverage length-wise, and based on the model photo, I was surprised how short it is on me (I am 5’1” and very short waisted)"
3.0,"Too big even for a &#34;small&#34;, had to return it."
3.0,Kids think they feel suffocating.
3.0,"Great  look of the top, but there was no stretch  to the fabric at all, and for a bustier woman this did not fit as described."
3.0,Pretty dress but order size smaller because fits big
3.0,Like it but sometimes can be really hot
3.0,"It looked great and fit was good also. Problem was after 2-3 washes the grey started turning like a peach color. Maybe it was the heat but for the price, I'd expect more."
3.0,"Overall fits great, a bit loose in the chest. I ordered the white one. My reasoning for the 3/5 stars versus more, is the white one is insanely thin/sheer. (Granted I know that’s most white shirts or tops but this one was quite thin material.) Going to wear something under it for sure."
3.0,"It's a decent price for what you get. Beware that the sizing (gauge size) is a little larger than normal.  It hurt just a little putting them in but the pain subsided shortly. I loved these earrings because they were a simple design. After about three months of wearing them my ears began to build up an allergy to them which was a little disappointing. So now I am unable to wear them, which makes me wonder if they are made completely of stainless steel."
3.0,It is a very pretty bellybutton ring. But the problem I have is the bar is much shorter than a regular bellybutton ring so it is uncomfortable to wear.
3.0,They were a little small.
3.0,not too bad for the price....simple...not flashy or exciting..but does the job.<br />waiting for a new better replacement now...get what you pay for
3.0,Shirt fits more like a regular fit rather than a slim fit. It is very roomy in the mid section.
3.0,The pant cuffs are a disappointment. The picture shows it as an elastic cuff but they are not.
3.0,"Love it, watch has kept time perfectly, well made I did change the band to something more visually substantial. I very much enjoy wearing it and the price was great.<br />EDIT..<br />Unfortunately a few weeks after I posted my review the glass on the back casing of the watch came off, Lost and now a watch I loved has turned into something I can only look at with annoyance, very dissatisfied."
3.0,I am 5'6 and 130 and ordered the small. Skirt makes hips look large from the pleated waist line and it is longer than i expected.
3.0,The closure on this chain is very tiny. I love the pendent but can’t wear it because the closure on the chain is too tiny to to hook. Really why is this necessary. So disappointing.
3.0,"It’s a super cute sweater, loved the material, the color, the softness but it definitely isn’t as long as the pic shows. It was short… doesn’t hide the fupa. Will be returning this."
3.0,"I ordered a light pink color. It was super cute, but after the first week it startes getting noticeable dirt marks. I tried cleaning it by their instructions but it didnt work. Couple weeks later, it was so dirty that I had to toss it.<br />Also, it is not as soft as the original band."
3.0,"Good quality, very solid construction. I like the look of the watch, it is very classy and spectacular.  My only complaint is that unless you are in very good lighting conditions it is VERY difficult to see the hands as they are the same color as the watch face.  I am exchanging mine for the black one which has better contrast with white hands on black face."
3.0,Did not fit right. Sizing was inconsistent with other styles from same brand.
3.0,"Looks really cheap, but it still looks good"
3.0,This umbrella was much smaller than thought. Not the golf size I expected. I should have pulled out the tape measure.
3.0,"Quality of the fabric is ok, not as nice as the ones I've previously purchased at JC Penny's. I've notice quite a few threads that I've had to cut...would bit putting purchase again. Price was only marginally lower than retail, and I can't justify taking the risk of poor appearance considering the fact I wear them for my profession."
3.0,These leg warmers were too small and short for women. I had to give them to my 8 year old granddaughter.
3.0,It will do.  I like the color.  I like the long sleeves.  I like that it's not super light.  It's a bit large.
3.0,"This shirt only came in small.  It's not nearly as long as it is in the picture and it doesn't have the black and white stripe band at the bottom (and what looks like maybe a tie on the side?)  It stops right before this band and is just all dots.  The material is nice and has a silky feel to it.  It have worn it under a suit and it looks cute, but I wanted to shirt in the picture."
3.0,"Very cute and great price, but as others posted the elastic and horn were coming unglued on several."
3.0,Pants way too big
3.0,The zipper broke the first time I used it on my vacation in Florida!<br />I was extremely upset. The print is super cute and the material thick and soft though....Buy at your own risk.
3.0,"I wish the seller would have included more pictures, i pictured it bigger. Other than that i have no complaints its a nice belt."
3.0,"The dress was beautiful but it runs very small. I'm petite and curvy, I ordered a large and it was still to small.  I just wish the sizes were more true to size."
3.0,Very good looking glasses. Bought for my 8 year old. Much cheaper than other brands. But sizing is off. The 8 yo size fits my 4yo perfectly and is too small for my 8 yo's face. Shame to have to go thru returns now.
3.0,"These arrived packaged well. In a large case that reminds me of old pipe cases, a screw driver on a keychain for the nose pieces and cloth lense cleaner are all included. They fit well and look super cute. However, I have to return them as the inside of the lense in reflective too. So I can see both my eyes/eye brows, as well as what is in my field of vision. Really bummed about this too,  but I had a pair by another brand with this problem before and it drove me bananas in certain lighting conditions. Not worth the hassle for me. Seems like a great product otherwise though."
3.0,"Don't do much in the padding area,, didn't do ANYTHING for the faciitus"
3.0,"Bought these for winter bicycle riding in North Dakota. They are single lens not double as in some snow goggles, so they ice up quickly in below zero temps. Tried them again above zero and they were not to0 bad iced up after 30 minutes in the single digit temperatures.."
3.0,"The bracelet came very quickly and was very well made.  I would of given the seller a 5 Star but after wearing the bracelet for the evening, I took it off and had pink spots from the pink beads on my wrist.  Not sure how the color of the beads came off???"
3.0,"Liked the lenght of the shorts very much -I am 5'9 and the shorts hit me just above the knee snd were nont too tight on the leg, which was what I was looking for. However, the shorts were too lose in the waist and abdominal area so there was a constant need to pull them up. The material not see thru."
3.0,First thing I noted was there were several clothing tags which were not related to this item in the pocket of the pants. I found that somewhat disturbing. They were clothing tags which were marked down. Pants are too big once worn for a short period of time. They are baggy.
3.0,I didnt like the copper smell..i guess its call an antique finish. I will call it a penny smells again. Cute design cat. Use it to hang in my vehicle. Probably good for young teen also. If i want to wear it i probably change to a better quality necklace. Came in the mail as expected delivery.
3.0,Secure bike to bike rack.
3.0,I liked the design but my ears were too big for the plugs. Or the plugs were too small. Either way the plugs were ok
3.0,I love the idea but am not sure how to keep it latched on my ear. Maybe instructions should have come with.
3.0,It is really cute. I ordered 5. We'll keep them all. We love Jack so it didn't matter that it was a bell.<br />I stuffed some foam inside. I would have liked the link to be shorter but again not a problem.
3.0,"Note: my three stars are for the PRODUCT; however, I feel that customers should know I have been contacted by customer service twice (even after politely declining the first time) in the two months since ordering offering me a refund (returned anyway) and then a discount to amend my honest review. Hopefully if others are receiving these discounts, they are making note of that in their review.<br /><br />Cute fabric and dress. However, top fit strangely. A larger bust would be spilling out while a smaller bust would leave the top baggy.<br />I'm pretty average, and I just couldn't make it work. It fit fine everywhere else. Unfortunately, I will have to return since I just can't make the top work."
3.0,"I really like this suit, and I wish it would have fit me better. The bottoms were just a tad big, and no support for the belly at all. That being said, if you don't need a ton of support for that area, this suit would be great. The top fit wonderfully and hangs pretty nicely."
3.0,"It’s a nice hoodie. Good quality, but it’s so big. I originally ordered a S for my 8 year old but returned it hoping the XS would work. It’s still big, but will have to do for Halloween."
3.0,"It’s ok for the price. It doesn’t have the stars or the TS logo, but that’s ok to me. I was expecting an oversized fit, but I’m a M/L and size M was too tight for the oversized look I was expecting according to the pictures. Also, the details are not deep blue as the original cardigan, but black. I’ll be returning."
3.0,"I wish I could give these a better review. I purchased three pair of these. When they arrived, we were impressed with the way they looked. When we opened their cases, we noticed immediately that one set was broken already. I messaged the seller and they sent out a replacement immediately. Took a few days to arrive but it arrived unbroken. We’ve used them maybe a hand full of times in the month we’ve had them. The rubber part around the lenses comes off but isn’t too hard to put back on.  The real issue that lowers the ratings here is the part that clips the back of the strap together. They break incredibly easily. I’ve had to rig them to be used because the plastic part broke on each one of them now. Really, maybe 5 or 6 uses on preteen and teen kids so not kids that are just being rough on them. Disappointed with that but I guess I was asking a lot for the price, I don’t know.<br /><br />Edited to add: didn’t realize these came with the nose plug. We found them hard to fit on noses (kids, 11-13) without stretching them a bit and that made them weaker and easier to break. It’s a decent deal but again, I wouldn’t call this a summer investment. I wish I had purchased a better quality and saved some money on ordering more throughout the summer."
3.0,Covers too much of my head instead of just ears. I went back to using my 180's. These would be good for 30 degF weather.
3.0,"Was sent wrong color, but love the ring."
3.0,I got a large base on my height and I feel comfortable and confident about doing so. The dress arrived in proper PRIME package and dress was in a clear zip locked bag. The fit good but I can't wait to wash it first time for the perfect Coca-Cola fit I really want. I rated 3 stars based on how I came about picking the size and how it fit now. I would've got a size M and my rated would be 4 but I wouldn't get 3 or 4 wears without feeling confident after the third wear. Hopefully this helps you out dear. Peace
3.0,but broke after wearing for about 3 hours
3.0,I love this suit. Very flattering for larger waist as attention is drawn to top.  However after wearing it 2 times the top white part started to curl/bend. So now it looks a bit funny.
3.0,3 stars because it was too small for my wrist. I used it as a gift item. The leather is nice but is very stiff new-it will take some time to soften up but the item is nice and price is great.  Delivery is direct from China.
3.0,"I ordered an XXLarge for my son and he was swimming in it. It was more like an XXXLarge. Otherwise, it was as described."
3.0,Don’t fit very well…XXL is like a XL
3.0,"I bought this dress for an ugly sweater party.  The XXL fit fine, and the material is stretchy.  Just be careful because the fabric is thin, so you will need to wear a slip or something underneath.  Or not.  I guess it depends on the party!"
3.0,"I love the design, but it's a little snug"
3.0,Quality is cheap. Won't get much wear out of it.
3.0,These look a little bit too fake.
3.0,I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  Hand too tight; fingers too long.
3.0,"These are really cute bracelets and are great for best friends as a gift. They are shiny with even, pretty lettering on the inside. The outside has stylistic arrows on either side of the opening. The only problem is that you have to bend the bracelet slightly to get it on and off your wrist and it's difficult to do that without warping it. That means after the first wear it isnt a perfect curve anymore."
3.0,"I like the leggings  - the quality seems ok, and I got lots of compliments the one time I wore them.  Not sure how they wash, however, since they are going away because they really are too small - if you have thighs, or glutes, these will definitely NOT fit you.  Seemed like they had room for some more stomach, but no butt.  And they were also too short.  Let's keep in mind I am neither tall, nor large - 5'8&#34; and 125 lbs.  So... if you are petite - these are super cute - the waist band is not so attractive, but most tops will cover that, but if you have muscles, height, or weight - probably skip this one.  Sad.  Wish they had another size up!"
3.0,40 bucks worth of gold in 2 bags. Dont think ill buy again
3.0,Items shrink after one wash.
3.0,They are too fragile especially if you are going to use them for prescription lenses. They break in the same spot. Bottom of the frame (your lens will fall out of it)
3.0,I thought it was thick but very thin but color said red and black so I brought red and black shoes it looks pink and I’m short 4’11 it’s very long but fits good
3.0,It’s beautiful but order a size or 2 up from USA size
3.0,"Salio muy chico , pero la tela es de muy buena calidad"
3.0,It's was a little in the small side
3.0,"Black dot in center front, not but looks like a hole really stands out on the soft gray."
3.0,Great protective accessory to keep your watch in tip top shape
3.0,XXL is the size of a medium.
3.0,Fit just right. Just wish the material was a little more thicker but great for those cool nights
3.0,"It’s pretty. But within a couple of hours of wear, the 3 chains tangle up into one chain. I have to keep taking it off to fix it."
3.0,The second hand dangles and does not work well. A lot going on with the watch and a bit challenging to use.
3.0,"The carved bone is beautiful, the hooks made of a cheap material"
3.0,"Fit my 5 year old, except for the ear holes. They pull his ears forward and hurt him. Keeping anyway. Just wont be able to use them as advertised."
3.0,"I have a larger bust, could not close buttons on top. But I put a bralette underneath and it looks great!"
3.0,"Love it,  but it broke after second time wearing it"
3.0,Coat runs very small. Order up 2 sizes. It's tight around the arms and waist area. Shipping was fast. BUT... Mine came WITHOUT the fur trim collar. And there's no way Amazon can replace just the fur trim that wasn't included on the coat. Buyer beware.
3.0,"My niece is a size 8, she lots her robes to be very roomy. ..watching tv. I bought this 14/16. It wasn’t roomy. I don’t know what happened."
3.0,"Pretty cute ring, but doesn't fit very snuggly."
3.0,It was smaller than the true size so order a larger size then you are. I gave it to my son instead of my fiance' so it worked out. It's a nice shirt.
3.0,They're okay..Just preferred them to be a little smaller.
3.0,"Nice dress, but too tight. Had to return."
3.0,"I wish they had an extra small, the top is just way too big and doesn't look flattering at all. It would be super cute if it fit right. I'll give it to my sister or one of her friends."
3.0,Didn't look as good on as in the picture. Some what large in the bust.
3.0,"These shoes are a good sturdy quality, the are just quite wide a little to wide for my son.  I do need to return them.  I'm only given UPS return options and I need a USPS Label as we are stationed and shipping from a DPO"
3.0,Material scratchy. Wasn't worth the price.
3.0,Very cute for someone with a larger top
3.0,Pro: The watch is awesome and comes in a lovely package. Con: Buyer beware- the rose gold metal band cannot be adjusted without a tool. It says in packaging that tool can be purchased in Amazon. I have yet to find the tool. So I am still only wearing the other strap.
3.0,Sleep masks were awesome! Earplugs were useless because the foam was old and didn't stay compressed long enough to be inserted into an ear.
3.0,"Super Cheap but took about 6 weeks to arrive from China.  Also, did not include the keyring as promised as part of purchase."
3.0,"get what you pay for, good."
3.0,"One shoe ever so slightly shorter than the other; both marked as same size. Luckily, my right foot happens to be ever so slightly shorter than the left, so it worked out well for me. Others may not have the same luck."
3.0,"Very nice , just a little tube unlucky to wear it because it came with the damaged sewing and I saw the need to take to repair to reinforce all seams blouse"
3.0,"Like trying to walk in UGG boots, there is no firm support on the bottom.  They look sort of good though I feel like Kanye West clomping around in them.  They are lined with fur and rather hot to wear so they ain't kidding when they named them &#34;snow boots&#34;."
3.0,"I have sewn for years and found the material to be of good quality.  I ordered a total of 3, an extra size larger due to previous reviews. I was thrilled when they arrived because believe it or not it is difficult to find a dressy white blouse at a reasonable price.  The fit was fine and I was ready to walk out the door when my daughter stopped me. She had me look in her 3 way mirror. The hem was totally skewed.  So disappointed! Had to return all three."
3.0,Too small but beautiful.  Gave it away.
3.0,"The style is as pictured, the color (beige) is not. I am returning it."
3.0,Really cute - sock is a little thin!
3.0,Ok item for what I need it for.
3.0,These were BEAUTIFUL. But very cheap. The roses broke off after 3 days of wearing them and thays with very gentle and light use. However they are cheap and amazing looking so personally i would buy again and again just to have.
3.0,Sounds good
3.0,"It doesnt hold its shape around the arms and collar area , dont dry it on warm."
3.0,clasp broke after 8 months.
3.0,"I love this dress, however, I am a well-rounded woman and this turned into a beautiful blouse.  I hate that it needs to be dry cleaned and/or ironed.  The bottom is a little snug and the fringe ties fell apart the first time I wore the dress, I just snipped them off and viola a vintage blouse I wear proudly with my jeans.  I would recommend this Dress/Blouse!"
3.0,The color was off was more pinkish than red.
3.0,The product is reliable as far as the product itself. Very nice. The issue was the buttons if you need more then one order a few packs of these because the variety of the size of the buttons is not even. You may have two large the rest rather small.
3.0,I bought these shoes for my 7 month old daughter. I bought them because she needed a pink shoe but after receiving the shoe I was sort of disappointed in the color of the shoe. It's not hot pink its a rusty almost orange pink....
3.0,"Super vac packed into a small packet, was surprised when I opened the packet and the joggers started growing.<br /><br />Nice quality but sizing was far too small."
3.0,"Ran pretty large, and made me look like a balloon, not like the picture at all. Wasn’t a fan-returned it. Quality seemed good though"
3.0,It was nice and all but broke in less than two weeks.
3.0,"I like the style of the necklace however, the clasp is not very good as if you turn your head side to side during conversations the clasp opens and the necklace falls off. Not a very good design."
3.0,The outfit was okay.  Material was thin for athletic wear.  The more I looked at it the more I was not impressed so I'm returning it for something else.
3.0,"Cute concept,  however not flattering for someone my size.  Top heavy with a rather larger stomach,  tight and shorter than I wanted.  Ordered an XL"
3.0,"I bought 2, one for me and my boyfriend. I was a bit disappointed when I saw how small the band was. I was hoping it would have had a wider band like the male ring. But other than that it's a quality ring"
3.0,Mask is of good quality. Paint job is sound. Size is suspect. It won’t fit if your head is adult large. Most likely won’t fit if your head is adult average.
3.0,"I like the fabric, although it is a bit thin/see through. The real problem and reason I’m returning it, is the body of the shirt fits properly but the shoulders and arms are cut small. If you are thin, or small framed with thin arms it probably would not be an issue."
3.0,"Weirdly, I've gotten a lot of compliments on these. They're the polar opposite of my style but I wanted something kind of unexpected and different to mix things up. I wound up really liking these except... they're really short! I wear a 32"" inseam regularly and these are about 2 inches above my ankles. To keep them from looking ridiculous I've been cuffing them.<br /><br />They're definitely a fashion pant in spite of the suggestion of ""outdoors and adventure"" so I would advise against any activity involving dirt because they'll stain quickly."
3.0,It fits a little large not to much; is confortable because of expandable texture.  But kind of expensive
3.0,It slipped off my scarf in the airport and I didn’t find it. I guess it rolls pretty well.
3.0,Run a big
3.0,This top has great potential but the material is defficult to de-wrinkle and the sequin under layer is too large for the size of the shirt. I am a 36B and typically wear a size 12 (L) in shirts. I ordered an XL in this too and the outer layer fits nicely. The faux under shirt is too large to stay in place and too low to show. I have been able to do some minor alterations on it to make it look more like the photo and keep the enormous sequin layer in place while wearing it. It's a pretty color and I like the concept. It's just not exactly a quality made item.
3.0,"It arrived on time, but I ordered and 2XL thinking that it would fit like a t shirt dress! So now I have to find some black leggings or some short to put underneath it!! It definitely runs small to someone who is 5'10 and a little thick around the mid section"
3.0,"Very easy to install, I have had them for some months now, need to remember you should always store your glasses in its case when not using them, ooops."
3.0,"Fit is a little smaller than I expected, or perhaps I'm a little bigger than planned!  Pad is a little stiff.  Back is cut lower than I prefer, but ymmv.  Still, good value for the price."
3.0,"I really liked that these came with filters.  But they're uncomfortable, itchy and fog up my glasses"
3.0,"Excellent streamlined design. Comfortable band. Crown too big, cutting into wrist at times. Using Velcro at base raises watch and minimizes problem.  Date wheel unusual in that “31” extends beyond before settling on “1”"
3.0,This is most definately a child sized hat.
3.0,"The compass arrive on time, and it seems sturdy enough on the outside. The compass takes a while to get your bearings with, it is very touchy."
3.0,"Working in a Genetics laboratory, when I saw this pair of earring I immediately thought of the double helix of an DNA.  I know it may sound geeky but it is so true.  The product came in a very nice box, and the earrings were in clear plastics.  I wish they would have put it on one of that earring holder though.<br /><br />There earrings is big, but light weight so no pressure on the ear.  I am giving it a 3 because I wish they run a bit shorter because I am petite so by wearing them, it actually is almost to my shoulder.  After of wearing them few times I accidently yank it off the hook when taking off my sweater.  It was a pure accident but proves that it was a bit more fragile then I suspected.<br /><br />I received this pair of earrings free of charge in return for my unbiased and free of charge opinion."
3.0,"delivered on time, but quality was less then expeted."
3.0,NOT Made in the USA as the description says.  Actually Made in Honduras.
3.0,"White ones fit but gave up on the black ones. Said they were both xl but the black ones are smaller and next to impossible for me to put on,"
3.0,They did not seem to be that polarized and are on the big side for a small face
3.0,"Buyer beware, this item runs extremely small. Typically I buy M/L to L/XL belts in stores I'm 5'3&#34; 220lbs and I wanted to wear it up high on my waist with a corset for a halloween corset and it barely fits. For this purpose its okay but everyday use too small!"
3.0,Good quality product. Only issue is shipped with two vests and no bow tie.
3.0,Chipping started almost right away. I dont mind silver so I will just scrape the rest off. The size is perfect. I just wish I had realized the gorgeous colors were not going to last.
3.0,It’s a very fun watch band that doesn’t get sweaty.  I’d buy it in a few more colors if the closure didn’t tend to slip.  The bead is just a bit too large for the macramé.
3.0,"I ordered 11m because my foot is wide and I need spaces between my toes. But I was sent a regular 11, I didn’t have time to search or return the shoes. So the 11 regular was uncomfortable after a hour wearing the boots."
3.0,"I really was hoping some other reviews I read online were flukes but sadly they were not. I loved the material and fit of this dress, However I can’t understand why they use such cheap material for the lacing.  The loops on both the front and back were broken. Also the embellishments are gold but the inside of the hood is yellow. That really makes it look cheap. I almost kept this dress and had the loops fixed but at the $55 price tag I felt I shouldn’t have to. If they corrected the manufacturing if this product I would definitely try it again but for now it’s a no."
3.0,Great comfortable shirt. Stretches with you.
3.0,Runs large buy size down
3.0,I really like the material of the shirts. But the big difference is the way they look on the add and to what they really look in person. What really bothered me is how wide the neck is. I doubt medium would have a closer neck fitting than the large. Which is the size I got.
3.0,Nice wish they still made them
3.0,Print is adorable but they're a little short waisted and rolled down too much for my liking. I'm a size 8/10. Gave them to my preteen daughter and they fit her much nicer.
3.0,Very nice just the black parts are very loose
3.0,Fit great but they do not have good tummy control. It actually pushes it out and almost make it look you have a gut. I’m 5’4” 130lbs and I w have to wear a long shirt to cover that area up
3.0,I like UnderArmor but don't much care for these shoes. Sorry I bought them They tend to ride outward at the heel and I fight to keep my foot in the center of the shoe. Most uncomfortable as well. Reason for the 3 star is that it could be possible that it is my feet. Otherwise I assign a 1 or 2 star. Surprised at UA.
3.0,"dress was fine, just didn't care for where the waist band hit on me"
3.0,The sunglasses are what you would expect for a pair of glasses under $15. The plastic frame feels a little flimsy but again for the price it seems adequate I guess. Other than that the product is exactly as described in the description. Would I buy them again? Probably for the price unless I knew that the quality was better for more money. I would definitely be willing to pay an extra few bucks for them to feel a little sturdier. But I am not disappointed in the product at all!
3.0,"The first thing I noticed was that it seemed like a received someone's return. There were fingerprints and minir scratches on one set of lenses. I decided to keep them because I didnt want to wait on new lenses. Then I compared them to my original Oakely Half Jacket XLJ lenses and they were slightly bigger. However, they did fit in good enough. I would have given 4 stars if they came to me new."
3.0,"Are beautiful, but too small"
3.0,"Zipper seems sticky, hard to unzip, not sure the zipper won't break quickly. Seams appear to be loose, lots of extra threads hanging long."
3.0,"Nice idea, but after awhile (regular use) the cards slip out slots if you have it so the card openings face down. Have to wrapa rubber /hair band around the long side of it so I don't lose anything"
3.0,"It's not a bad product, but it's not as warm as it was promised, better suited for fall or as base layer for winter in places like TX, TN, NV, etc... meaning it's not nearly warm enough for New England where I happen to be. The fleece promised is just a thin layer of extra fuzzy fabric, and it fits looser than expected (5'3 125 lbs).<br />But hey, it helped as long as I wore 2 more layers on top and they are comfortable, machine washable, they don't stain, don't really create static and are affordable. So if you're beneath the Mason Dixon line, these might fit your bill."
3.0,"I should have checked the size. Way too small love the earring, but expected something larger.<br />Will return"
3.0,"The hat looks good, but has a rough texture, is smaller than the other S-M Hurley hats we have, and the logo is more white than the picture shows (appears light blue)."
3.0,These earrings are beautiful but they are way to big for me.  There was not a description of their size but in the picture I assumed they were about 1 1/2 inches.  I won't be able to wear them.
3.0,Does not hold in belly.  Normal leggings
3.0,chain is rather short
3.0,With the design the hole ride up to upper thigh
3.0,Nice fit but you will need shape wear this dress show ever lump and bumps but my shape wear smoothed everything out. The dress is loose not baggie I'm  5&#34;2 136pds it hits me below  my ankle with out touching  the ground.
3.0,looks nice but too long. when I cut off excess it reveals 2 pieces glued together over a thin piece of fabric. Now I have to glue it back together.
3.0,"This dress did not fit me right. It was very tight around my chest and back and then extremely flowy throughout. It may look good on some, but not the right fit for me. The strap was also broke and the company replied quickly, however I have still not been refunded for a product returned over a month ago."
3.0,"Love the style, ordered size 8 but received size 6"
3.0,This is a great looking watch that my husband wears for both business and casual situations.<br />The Fossil Q app is very user friendly and you can assign a bunch of different tasks to the 3 buttons.<br />He uses it specifically to control his Amazon music app: volume and changing songs.<br />The watch automatically records your steps which you can view in the app.<br />The watchband is plenty big and has a nice push-to-open button versus the normal click-snap.<br /><br />Battery is expected to last 4-6 months.  I'll update this review if the battery life falls outside this range.
3.0,"I purchased the XXL thinking I would be swimming in it, but it fits like a size large. I'm 5'7 170, the hips and upper back are tight. The legs are short and the crotch area is long, making it weirdly loose in that area. Because of the way it's sewn, when I lay down the legs ride up to my calves and it's really annoying, The zipper is too short, and there are no pockets. The color is more bubble gum pink. The fabric is soft and as pictured, but I definitely would not put it through the dryer. The overall fit I feel like doesn't consider the shape of a woman's body."
3.0,"shrank considerable in washer, didn't dry"
3.0,"Pros: I found this surprisingly warm. Granted I was not out in a blizzard. The hole is in the right place for a high ponytail.<br />Not good or bad: It does not give quite the same profile as a baseball cap.  Something looks just a little ""off"" to me.<br />Cons: However, it completely trashes my hair when I take it off.<br />It will do."
3.0,Good Product but arms a very tight for my lil one and she is small.  we had to cut the sleeves off so she can use<br />so upsizing is needed if you're going to get this product
3.0,This necklace is very nice. But I’m missing a charm
3.0,It will work for travel put it’s flimsy plastic cheap.  Wish I hadn’t bought it! I’d return if I had time.
3.0,"I am 5&#34;2' and 100 lbs. I got a size Medium and the length was fitting, but the sleeves were too short for my comfort.<br />I like wearing oversized longsleeve shirts and using the sleeves to hide my hands when I'm chilly, but this shirt's sleeves couldn't do that and I'm usually a size XS, size S for oversized. I would say to order three sizes up if you're looking for it to be cutely oversized, but then the length might be too long."
3.0,"Not color advertised, shirt is more of a cornflower blue."
3.0,We loved our new luggage on our trip to Denver.  This is the first trip we take and on the way back I went to grab it of the luggage return and the handle just broke right off.....not the best quality!!!
3.0,shoes are so sexy. i wore them for halloween. the only downfall is i cant stand in them for very long because they hurt my feet. totally need more padding. but still a good product for what i used the for.
3.0,I like this bag. It's a lot larger than I expected. I also thought it would have pockets.
3.0,May be returning this one .It is cute but does have alot of material. Im 5' 6&#34; 160 lbs .I bought the large but should have down sized as other reviews had stated .Even with a belt it just has to much extra material .
3.0,Nice socks don't get me wrong but seemed a bit small and compression was not  as I expected
3.0,"Get at least a size larger than you usually do, two sizes if you want it to fit long and loose. It's pretty short and tight and lowcut."
3.0,"I really love the appearance of this toe ring, but practicality is just not in its favor. It got snagged on absolutely everything: socks, shoes, towels, blankets, sheets, anything within its vicinity. I wore it for a while but ended up just getting frustrated and replacing it with a simpler design."
3.0,"Not the best, doesn't look the same as pictured. The bracelet easily comes apart without the key by just tugging on the chain with a fair amount of force. Can be unlocked with any key that is included in a similar product."
3.0,"Bought these for gifts and although they are nice, the zippers aren't very sturdy."
3.0,You get what you pay for. It's honestly nor bad quality. You have to clean it out with a q tip bc there is machining oil in it. But I'm a machinist so I get it. And expect it. The only things I have to complain about and the reasons why I gave it 3 stars is because the hoop to hold it to the necklace has a TINY weld I feel won't last long. And the chain is super short. Other than that like I said you get what you pay for. I also received it way before the estimated date. Thanks.
3.0,Very wrinkled after you wash it. I don't want to have to iron anything but I guess I'll have to.
3.0,"Although the description says &#34;small&#34;, it is not. It is standardized size. High quality and design, but definitely not small. I couldn't wear them."
3.0,This mask is way too big. The eye holes didn’t even line up properly.
3.0,"These are authentic and licensed, and they are cute. But they pill badly after just one time wearing them."
3.0,"Super cute but won't fit him until he's in 12 month or larger clothing, which is fine but wish he could wear now:)"
3.0,Definitely wind proof! Worked well until the zipper broke after the first wear
3.0,Mediocre quality already threading. But for the price it is worth it and so beautiful
3.0,Buttons fell off shortly after putting the shirt on. I had to see them back on. I like the shirt though.
3.0,"This pajama set is so comfortable that I like to wear it around the house, as I normally don't like to wear anything with elastic to bed. The material feels light, soft and willowy but a little too thin. I ordered the ""blue tie-dye"" and it's a really pretty shade, it reminds me of the sky and sea mixed together in a swirly pattern. As far as the fit, it fits me well and in my opinion, it's true to size. It held up well in my washer and dryer (cold water, delicate cycle). However, as far as the price, in my opinion, I think it's overpriced for its quality."
3.0,I ordered a 10 to 12 cause the size chart showed it to be a large when it came in it was a medium so if you order get a size up had to spend another 10 bucks so i had a shirt that fit for the baby shower
3.0,"These are made of soft fabric, which is nice.  However, the picture distinctly shows a more form fitting mask, lower under the eyes and higher up on the nose.  That is the reason I choose to buy this mask over the other one that looks identical, except it has no contouring.  It is loose, and, without the contouring, the air I breathe out goes directly into my eyes."
3.0,Every cheap material looks like it will easily fall apart. You get what you pay for maybe useful for a couple a times.
3.0,"The color is vibrant and its a beautiful gown, but it didn't fit. Its supposed to be a 3x and it didn't even fit my friend who is an xl. The booby covers are too close together. I can't imagine it even fitting anyone's chest. Also the thread is a different color than the fabric.<br />I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,The top of this suit is not made for pool rough-housing.  Be prepared to be exposed if you jump in the water or if your toddler is &#34;grabby&#34;.  The top also tends to fit looser when in the water & wet.  The bottom is very flattering with the high waist.
3.0,"This dress is gorgeous in person, but I had to return. I ordered a M and I’m 5’2 and 178lbs and it fit me perfectly minus these details. The ruffled part in the middle of the dress cut of your breasts if you have a decent size bust. So that’s not flattering. And you can’t pull it down because it shows a lot of cleavage. So not something I’m comfortable with so due to both of those things I had to return but I wish I didn’t have to because it truly is gorgeous!"
3.0,"What I like about the wallet: good quality leather, nice color, and divider separating the money area into two pockets is handy<br />What I don't like about the wallet: It's extra width makes it hard to take out from rear pocket of slacks (get's caught in the pocket opening). This is not a problem if you wear jeans everyday. The credit card slots are very tight and it's hard to take out and put back credit cards if you have more than one per slot.<br />Verdict is still out: I've had this wallet for 3 weeks so not sure on this wallet's durability. So no word on durability of stitching or leather. So far so good."
3.0,When you have them on it's hard to tell it's the Hulk.
3.0,Fine but too similar to another dress I have. Returning. Thanks<br />Sandy
3.0,Fits great in the body but the bust area is awkward and not really fitting. It doesn’t support and doesn’t seem meant for girls “of all sizes”
3.0,"The Fit was to small and it was see through, but I liked the stretchy fabric and the design was good"
3.0,This did not look anything like the picture. The material was like a wrinkly T-shirt and the color was not the same. It was very very casual.
3.0,These looked more like antique gold; changes color fast
3.0,"Not true to size. I ordered a a 3X returned it...it swallowed me. Tried a 2X, returned that for a 1 X. Decided to keep the one X, but I still had to take in the waist"
3.0,Its ok. It doesn't look exactly like the picture quality and color. Its brassy looking in person and thin whereas in the picture it has more of solid quality and rich finish.
3.0,When I put these shoes on with the blue inserts they already had in place they felt great for about 30 seconds then my arch on my foot started throbbing. I tried the black inserts that also came with the shoes and they had a different texture and were not as soft as the blue ones but they too had that high stiff arch support. I have a normal arch and I don't need shoes that have a greatly pronounced arch support.
3.0,"The fit is too tight to wear anywhere other than the gym and the material is very thin which actually makes it a decent workout shirt, which is what I'll use it for.  But that was not my intent when I purchased it, thus the 3 stars.  The color is incredible."
3.0,Dress size runs small.  Size up
3.0,"I originally got a medium and it was too large so I ordered a small and got another medium by mistake. The dress is cute and I think would’ve fit well. I normally wear a medium in most things so this runs a bit big, I would’ve had to take it in. I’m very curvy 5’7 170lbs small waist larger chest and hips and the medium was too large for my waist. Nice dress but had to return both."
3.0,The material the shirt is made of is not like what you would expect for a sweat shirt. It is thin silky shiny material. Not a cozy sweatshirt. Does not match the photo.
3.0,I bought this dress for a wedding and really wanted to love it. The cobalt blue color is gorgeous and the cut is very flattering. I am 5'3 155 lbs and the large fit fine. BUT I was disappointed that the dress was folded to fit into a small envelope and was VERY wrinkled upon arrival. When I went to try it on the top button immediately popped off. The material felt very cheap so I thought maybe ironing might make it better as I layed the dress out to iron I noticed several loose threads along the waist. I will be sending the dress back for a refund.
3.0,The bracelet is the same as shown in the picture. The color of the bracelet is not towards gold texture instead it is more yellowish. The gems are pretty cute but not that shiny. I would spare wearing this bracelet in formal gatherings.
3.0,Pro:  this purses a very nice style. It's large enough to carry a thermos and all of my essential needs for work. It has tons of space and pockets. There is even a zipper pocket on the outside which is a great place to keep your keys.<br />Cons:  The opening on the top of the purse seems very narrow and it's very hard to put things in-and-out of the purse. The straps seem to be in a weird position  and only feels natural when the purse is zipped.  The interior pockets that hold your phone and perhaps a pair of sunglasses seemed short so I kept feeling like my zipper with scraping the top of my phone And when you set the purse down they fall out of the pockets.  Over all I would say this purse is OK it is not great for everyday use and not what I was looking for a plan to return it
3.0,The charm comes off a LOT but otherwise it's pretty good.
3.0,It looked larger on the website than actually is.
3.0,Belt was not attached not had belt loops. Otherwise it's a comfortable robe made of tee shirt material.
3.0,All is good except the waist has a tight band that makes these less fun to wear than others I have.
3.0,was ok but not quite the quality i expected
3.0,Exactly as pictured. Very warm.
3.0,Does not seem to be comfy for big wrist.
3.0,More narrow than the picture shows
3.0,Ordered a larger but fits like a medium.. order another size for another family member which was a size medium but fits a small person.
3.0,fabric is klingy and wrinkly
3.0,Gave to my niece. She liked it
3.0,"I love the color and materials, I did not choose the correct size, chest line is tight."
3.0,These do the job but they are fairly heavy material which personally I am not comfortable wearing especially in the summer. Pretty much exactly as shown in item description. Nothing fancy and I think durable is a good word to describe.
3.0,"I liked the glasses but when the earpiece slid off, the pearl came off and was gone."
3.0,Product not so good for the price. One time use item.
3.0,Was way large for my GF... Had to give it away...
3.0,poor quality. It's broken only a few times.
3.0,"it looks nice, but the little mouse piece came off after 2 weeks"
3.0,You get what you pay for. The plastic peeled of the bottom of the dice cups within 5 minutes. The felt on the board was cut by Stevie Wonder. The pieces have tape on the bottom holding a tiny magnet in and the dice have spots and scratches. Ok for a travel set though.
3.0,So pretty and so cute but very small
3.0,Paints fit jacket did not
3.0,Not what I expected.  Very stiff.  Hardware is very cheap.  Would not buy again.
3.0,not really worth it.  I have a number of watches and decided getting this to store and protect them was better than having them loose in my dresser drawer.  It just takes up space and gathers dust.  I think i am going back to the dresser drawer method.
3.0,"Looks like a moo-moo. Go down at least one size. Fabric is very thin. It’s the fabric of a shirt, not a jacket. You could maybe later it above another shirt."
3.0,I like it but it runs small
3.0,The thread of bad material
3.0,"I loves this dress but unfortunately it didn't fit my current body size/shape. I've lost a lot of weight while breastfeeding and purchased in a size small. The dress was way too loose everywhere, even the bust and I'm not lacking up there right now. I'm not very curvy right now with very little hips or behind. It didn't look good on me with the fit but it's a beautiful dress. I'm 5'4"" 115 lbs"
3.0,"My bra shows through this shirt. It’s cute, just too thin."
3.0,The necklace wasn't as big as I expected but cute overall
3.0,"This is a nice dress, but because of its relaxed and baggy fit it has a very casual look to it.<br />The deep purple color is pretty. The fabric is delicate and comfortable, but more suited to warmer months."
3.0,"I normally where an XL, this shirt fits like a medium. It's a nice shirt, just way too small. If you this shirt, buy two sizes bigger."
3.0,Short and wrinkly
3.0,My son likes this coat but it runs small. I bought the size 12 and it is more like a size 10. He can wear it this year but I will need to buy him a new coat next year.
3.0,"Problem charging left shoe. Have to keep it plugged in longer than other shoe. Child seems to like them, although not really happy wearing any shoes."
3.0,"Very cute dress, fits well. The only issue I have is that it faded after the first wash."
3.0,"I love the dress it's very pretty. Good quality, doesn't look cheap. Can wear to office or out on the night. I'm 5'8 in it came right below my knees, I was expecting it to be a little shorter. Overall I'm satisfied."
3.0,Fabric is great. The waistband rolls with the elastic in it.
3.0,Cute but much smaller than it leads you to believe. Take body sizes and shapes into consideration while researching reviews!
3.0,"The socks are well made & would give great compression.  For me, I was unable to wear.  Size seemed much smaller than it should have been.  I am a senior & could not put them on.  They seem like great socks, just not for me."
3.0,"Was disappointed but mainly in myself for not reading the specs on the product, I thought it would be blue but with further inspection of the pictures alas it is not. 😕 I should have read about the size as well because it's a Barbie size bottle, pretty sad. 😕 one plus is that it's cute."
3.0,Looked really nice for my grandson but the polarized lenses don't block much sun.  Not thrilled but decent.  Like the little bag that comes with them because its microfiber and can be used to clean the glasses.
3.0,"Good mask but eye holes could be a little bigger, also should have a small opening for your mouth.  I ended up cutting a real small hole so I can get some fresh air."
3.0,These are okay but they are really really small and I ordered an XL.  Not something I would buy again.
3.0,"It's barely been 2 months and it's already frayed. I get that it's dirty, I mainly just use my watch for walking."
3.0,This fanny pack doesn't work. It is very well made except that it is very large and the adjustment strap does not hold the bag around the waist when items are placed in it. The bag slides down the torso. Very annoying. I have returned the fanny pack.
3.0,"Did not last long before getting rusty looking, but was beautiful while I had it, wore it nearly daily during the summer and really sparkled.  For the price it was as expected."
3.0,"It's okay.  I'm 5'3 110lbs and I bought small.<br />this doesn't fit like a work out clothes where it shows body line, which could be good for certain activities, but it almost unflatter your curve, ad make you look &#34;square.&#34; The shoulder/thigh area is tight."
3.0,good solid wallet the bands lossen some but you get 2.
3.0,"After reading reviews saying they run small I ordered a size L, which the sticker on the package claims 36-38.  I am a 32 to 33 and they are very slim.  I measured the elastic waist band without stretching and it measures 30&#34; so that should give you an idea what a size L is like.  There's absolutely no way someone with 36-38 waist could comfortably were these.  After washing these, I'm going to assume they will shrink and fit more like boxer briefs vs boxers.  Other than the absolute sizing gaffe, the product looks nice."
3.0,"Way too big for a women’s shoe. Also, hard to work the stretcher to fit the length."
3.0,very pretty but too small for me
3.0,Pretty colors and cute style. Way too big on me and I’m not tiny.
3.0,Tie looks good. I didn't realize it had sparkling dots! They look gray in picture. Still like it.
3.0,"Worked well for my sister's wedding but was a little more snug than I would have liked. It is elastic so it stretches but I'm 5'4&#34; and around 145lbs and it was tight enough I felt it gave me bulges above and below the belt. Also, I liked the idea of the flowers but the very middle of them stick out and look a little silly. Overall though it was cute with my blush dress and worked well!"
3.0,"The reason I only give it three stars is when it got here the &#34;leather&#34; strap was not sewed on the left side so I had to sew it myself, and the quality is iffy. Scared to even put this through a wash"
3.0,Great style size ....kind of fragile.... Had to reglue flower into ring
3.0,Cheap material - it folds and if you're not careful the shoe bends. The glitter ball things shed. Cute though!
3.0,Nice but bands come unfastened
3.0,"The socks came on time and the packaging was great, however, the size large was too small for my husband who is a very average size 10 in shoes. He was disappointed."
3.0,"Unfortunately, my dress arrived damaged. I'm hoping I can repair it. There just isn't enough time to get another."
3.0,"Nice dress, alittle long so it drags."
3.0,Disappointed as the belt to this product broke after about 3 weeks.
3.0,"I expected more of a jean material, when it was, listed as Heavy Duty, it's not., the edges are frayed and, it looks cheap, I like it long but that's about it."
3.0,"Great quality.  However,  I'm a size 32 and the belt is to long. It dose fit but there is to much left over that just hangs there cause it wont secure under the next belt loop. So it just flops around"
3.0,"Softer than expected, actually."
3.0,"Fit ok. I am 5'10"" so the waist line fell just below my chest instead of at my waist.  Still acceptable to wear except arrived with a burnt sausage smell that I assumed would come out once I washed it but has still not come out. So unfortunately taking an L with this one."
3.0,"Looks great and it’s light weight, however, they broke very easily. Perhaps this type of wood isn’t a good material for sunglasses. I wouldn’t recommend"
3.0,"I realize that I ordered this right before Christmas, but it took almost a month to arrive. Disappointed. Shirt is pretty thin. Printing looks good."
3.0,Was very disappointed when I realized it came from China we as Americans must stop depending on them and make our own products! They are not even our Friends!
3.0,"The fabric is not what I expected.  It is a dry, slinky fabric that pulls very easily.  Was hoping for a more cotton feel."
3.0,Nice leather but it literally can accommodate just a few sheets of paper. For that price it should be a functional folder with decent amount of space. Unfortunately I had to return it and still looking for something similar with more space
3.0,Cute but you can tell cheaply made. One earring you have to put on from the back of your ear because if I put it on from the front the gem would be backwards.
3.0,Just wasn't what I expected after I got it  so I just keep hanging on my mirror. Looks good there.
3.0,"Nice costume, decent quality, but i have not received the tie, that's why the 3 stars."
3.0,"The shirt fit exactly as I would expect it to. Unfortunately, the material is a little more see through than I care for, but even when I purchased the black version.<br /><br />That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just not what I was looking for in a shirt."
3.0,Didn't really like.  Much confusion about my order.  Long wait.  Not worth it.
3.0,The sandals are cute just bad quality
3.0,gets smaller at the bottom
3.0,Usually wear Medium ordreded XL Very Small did not fit.
3.0,Little ringlet pulled apart when putting on the first time but fixed with a pair of pliers in no time. It sure does turn heads.
3.0,"I bought this in size large in maroon, and it was quite fitted, which was ok.  Then I ordered the gray in the same size and it was a lot smaller!  Likely it was labeled wrong.  Rather than send it back, I gave it to my daughter, and ordered up a size for me.  It was barely bigger than the large (btw I usually wear a medium).  The shirts are made of a thinner material and they’re quite stretchy.  They adhere to your shape so I wasn’t able to get the baggy shirt look that the model has in the picture, even ordering up a size.<br /><br />I’d say definitely order up at least one size."
3.0,...but had to return cause they were way to small for an 8.  more like a 7! order up a size
3.0,Not compression socks. More like men’s dress shoe socks. Not athletic at all.
3.0,"I have these in the pink and black sandal. Though beautiful, they do run small. I wear an 8.5 but honestly, should have ordered a 9.5. as they run quite small. I wish they offered a wide size in these shoes."
3.0,These are stylish but not for me. They run small so they are tight on the sides of the head. They are also fairly light and don't block out much of the sun
3.0,"I like the cuff, its really nice however it is heard to keep it upon my ear.<br />There is nothing to hold it up there."
3.0,"The bag is nice,  seems like decent quality.... but one of my straps is coming undone from the bag.  The thread is pulling away.  I'm a little disappointed as I've only had it a month and I'm very careful with my bags."
3.0,"I wear flip flops all day. I have Havaianas, Rainbows, Hurleys, and now Billabong. Of all of them, these Billabong I just got are the least comfortable. The sole is slim and hard on the heels and the back. Not much cushion if any. I bought them at the same time as a pair of Hurleys. It's night and day in favor of the Hurleys. The Billabong's design is eye catchy but I'm glad the my apartment's carpet provides the cushion these flip flops don't offer."
3.0,"I ordered the pack of 200 but only got 140. 2 Christmas themed, 5 Halloween themed but not all the skeleton pieces. Nice variety, only one duplicate. But missing 60 out of 200."
3.0,"I needed something fast and cheap, this fit the bill. My son likes how they look and feel. As expected based on the price, quality isn't that great and these shoes won't last more then a couple months."
3.0,"cute, but not big enough. really should be a childs sock. I gave mine to my 7 yr old."
3.0,"I LOVE the look of this boot. However, the boot is too narrow, ankles are wide and the calf is small. I have narrow feet and even my feet were kind of smushed in there. I have large ankles and they were swimming in the boots. I do have medium/big calves so finding boots in between a wide and regular has always been my problem.<br />You will need to order a size up"
3.0,"They're bulky and fit poorly. You can feel the cheap plastic on the inside that is supposed to shape the earmuffs. When you un-fold them to put them on, they don't return to a normal earmuff shape but instead become uneven. Overall, they do the job of covering the ears, but they're neither comfortable or easy to use."
3.0,"It’s cute, it’s lightweight, and the girl loves it.<br /><br />However. It’s also kind of cheap. The fabric is thin. And the ribbon belt accent doesn’t even go ask the way around.<br /><br />It does have two layers, so the underskirt gives a little extra volume, and keeps an active child from having an entire dress caught between her legs.<br /><br />It fits a bit bigger than I had expected, which is only problematic if you’re planning on wearing it somewhere. But it’s the middle of a pandemic, and the summer. She’s just wearing it to wear it.<br /><br />For what I paid, in certainly not upset. But I also wouldn’t pay more than maybe $10 for it."
3.0,"I loved all the different styles but only a couple fit.  Most of these are made for people who have very, very,<br />skinny fingers.  The construction is fine though."
3.0,"I really like the quality of these glasses, the blue blocking feature, and how they look on my face. BUT...I don’t think I received the correct power because they are too wrong. I ordered 1.00 magnifier and they are definitely stronger than that...so much that they give me a headache. The frames are labeled 1.00 but I think the lenses are over 2.00. Would love for somebody to contact me about this."
3.0,This bracelet is pretty but is heavy to wear.
3.0,"The dress is cute but when I hand washed the dress, which the directions indicated, the bow came a part. Surprisingly, the dress washed well.<br />Take away: bows must be washed carefully and dress quality is overall decent but will probably only last for a short period of time."
3.0,"I have strong opinions of this shirt, and not all of them good.<br /><br />First of all, I like the style. The patchwork leopard sleeves are cute, and the material is soft. Having said that, I got this in 2XL, and it doesn't seem like a 2XL at all. I'm a size 16, and I wear pants that are 16 and XL, no problem. My biggest ""problem area"" is my stomach, so I tend to prefer shirts that are oversized. The last 2XL shirt I got fit like a tent, and I was happy with that (especially during winter seasons when you want something warm and bulky anyway)<br /><br />This shirt was... ugh. I don't know why they insist on making larger sizes in this stretchy, form-fitting material. It clings to your curves, and that's fine if you have nice curves, but less find when it's hugging a stomach that doesn't need to be hugged. Does someone buying a 2XL shirt really want that huggy material? Am I the only one who doesn't?<br /><br />Also ,the shirt could be longer. I was wearing a t-shirt under this thing, and about 3 inches of the t-shirt was popping out beneath it. If I lifted my arms and I was ONLY wearing this shirt, it would be a peekaboo belly situation.... which, at my size, isn't cute.<br /><br />If you like form-fitting clothes that hug you, this shirt would be great, and cute. But if you're like me and you're buying XL to hide, look elsewhere."
3.0,"This is tight across the shoulders, there is no finish hem and the top of the sleeve is very poufy. The material is really pretty."
3.0,"These are huge! I only saw the &#34;infants&#34; part of the &#34;infants and toddlers&#34; line. Definitely not for infants. They appear to be good quality, a bit cheesy looking, but now I have to put them away somewhere to wait for them to fit her, I'm going to guess at least 2 years from now. Hopefully I'll remember they exist when she can actually wear them. I saw someone else say they were perfect for their 9 month old walking baby-- I'd like to meet that baby, it would be quite a baby!<br /><br />Good colors otherwise. They are individually wrapped as well which is wasteful packaging wise."
3.0,"Definitely NOT a ""sun umbrella."" The material is so thin, it barely casts shade, and the sun shines right on through. The size does make it nifty though."
3.0,"The design and materials are OK for a budget readers glasses but I found out that they have some sort of tint to it (I don't really know if that's the blue light filter) but I cannot seem to get used to it, specially on sunny conditions. I bought the +3.00 version. The frame is quite light and the design is modern.<br /><br />I Previously bought a pair of other style occhi chiari reading glasses that worked PERFECTLY! But those had clear lenses (no tint) and the power was 2.75."
3.0,It’s very cute but ripped on sleeve for no reason not even in the seem. My daughter has only wore it once. And put it on yesterday and she felt something wrong with sleeve and it had about a 4 inch ripped in the back of sleeve
3.0,"Not as long as pictured, fit small"
3.0,I really like these earrings. They are pretty unique and good quality. The reason I give them 3 stars it's because you need to be careful of not losing them. They move and you may drop them off.
3.0,"These are a bit on the heavy side. My daughter didn’t mind, so I gave them to her."
3.0,Ring needs to be a 8mm or 10mm not a short 6mm.<br />And needs the catheter with the needle so it's easier to place the ring into the hole without issue.
3.0,"I purchased these to fly in. They were a great fit for just being at home with your feet up. But for flying and lots of movement I found that they rolled at the top. The compression strength was great, and I loved the open toe."
3.0,The bands looked like the original fit bit band.  The first one broke after one month the second has outlasted it so far.
3.0,"The quality are good, but the size is small then the photo."
3.0,"Packaging caused heavy wrinkles  and the quality of the lining appeared cheap.  However, the style of the coat was cute."
3.0,The top looks distressed in photo which i liked but that is not the case - totally solid in color.  I was going to order a couple more but will not because of that.  The fit is fine which is suppose to be oversized.
3.0,"Definitely size up if you’re looking for the relaxed fit style. Over all the material doesn’t have much stretch and isn’t super soft, thick T-shirt feel. The look is very in style. The back of the shirt is all white, no stripes and a bit see through."
3.0,"It's nice, but Im small in the chest area & it's a little too big for being a small in that area & you can't adjust the straps. It's a silky material."
3.0,They were adorable but the pin that you use to put the bead on for the head...every single one of them broke off and couldnt be reattached so i had to come up with a creative way to add the head.
3.0,"I purchased this item for my husband. He works really long hours and when he is a super tired he tends to fall dead asleep.  when this happens he usually breathes and snores with his mouth open.<br /><br />He thought I was joking when I told him to try it. He said that it fit a little snug and he was worried that it would come off during the night. It did work as intended especially when he would turn over and sleep on his back.  It did not come off easily and the only thing that he didn't like about it was that it left marks on his face the next morning. These marks only lasted an hour so but they are worth the quiet, peaceful night I got!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,I bought these in black. These pants are very nice at first. I saw a lot of complaints about the waist not being stretchy but I found that helpful! As long as you don’t order them too small you won’t have a problem getting them over your hips and they stay up. Other pants I have that are stretchy tend to stretch out during the day and you find yourself yanking them up. These don’t do that and they look great! I also saw complaints about shrinking so I didn’t dry them. However after about three washings and no drying they started to break down. Little rubber bands sticking out around the seams and after a few more washings everywhere which are white and noticeable that’s why I had to rate them a three. I really wanted them to last longer:(
3.0,Very comfortable Shoes Fit great<br />Stitching on Right front coming unsewn
3.0,"Sweet shirt, way too small for 3xl. 3xl is more like an xl. Super cheap shirt."
3.0,"I wanted a non terrycloth wrap to wear and warmer weather so I tried this one.  For me, a 33"" waist guy, the fit is fairly big.  I have the hook/loop strap choked down as far as I care to take it and it still feels a bit loose on me.  Some of the looseness can be attributed to spongy elastic with not much contraction to it.  Makes me wonder if it will last many wash/dry cycles before I am looking for a new way to close it together.  Time will tell and maybe I will get a pleasant surprise.  Other than that, it is what I wanted , a non terrycloth wrap in a comfortable length."
3.0,"Charm is very cute and fits my pandora charm bracelet well, but you can’t really read it you have to look very close to be able to see what it says."
3.0,"Good fit initially, but unfortunately shrunk two sizes down in the wash."
3.0,It's prettier on the website than in reality. It looks a little cheaper when it arrived.
3.0,My only complaint is that these don’t wash very well - by hand or in the washing machine. It feels as though they start to deteriorate after getting wet.
3.0,lenses too small and glasses are heavy....keeps sliding off
3.0,"I'm 5'4' and 127 and ordered a medium and I usually wear a medium.  I really liked the fabric weight, color (charcoal gray) and softness. However, the cut was too slim fitting in the hips and too long in the torso for my shape.  I considered keeping it and wearing it up at my hips but then the pockets fold open, plus...there was a hole in one pocket - which was disappointing for $99!  I do wonder if a large wound hang better around my hips but then it would probably be too big everywhere else.  I may order a large to try.  I sent the medium with the hole in the pocket back."
3.0,"This is a very cute ring, but sadly seems more fit for smaller piercings. I have a 9mm drop on my piercing, and I suspect the drop on this ring is 8mm. At first it just felt snug, but after a few days it was very painful and when I removed it (also very painful) I discovered it had reopened my piercing. Ow. Ow. Ow. It was also a little too narrow, and my guess is that the post is 4mm wide."
3.0,For the price I was expecting more. The capes are nice and the materials are good.  The masks are cheap felt like material.  The capes are really too big for smaller kids as the Velcro allows for limited adjustments.
3.0,They got nicely and I wear sweaters and  my boots with them
3.0,I bought this for my granddaughter but was shocked when I received it and the tag was cut out!! I feel like I paid full price for a used item!<br />Wasn’t happy about this! Why would a tag be cut out of a new blouse!?? I’d like an explanation.
3.0,"Cool design, but the edges are not seemed. So it's likely to fray eventually"
3.0,"Love the skirt's price, colors, and length, but the fabric and the little bow leave a lot to be desired.  I thought the skirt would be a woven cotton fabric, it is not. It is a thick rayon polyester fabric, which is yellow and blue on one side and white on the other, that is not very breathable. Wear this in warm weather and you will be toasty warm, perhaps even uncomfortable.  The photo in the Amazon listing looks large and lush. The bow that actually comes with the skirt is nowhere near the size or construction of the one in the listing. It looks like something I may have made poorly in Home Ec.  Debating whether I will return the skirt due to the fabric choice and the hideous little bow."
3.0,"The shoes are nice but very narrow. My son has a standard width foot for a 4 year old, but these are narrow."
3.0,For the price I was expecting something that looked a little more...elaborate and something that wouldn't wrinkle on sight!<br /><br />The fabric is just weird. The v-neck is at a height that is not flattering at all and is a little bit snug on arms.<br /><br />I guess that's the risk of onlining shopping
3.0,"Good value for the price, but it is made in China, so the size runs very small."
3.0,"Well...it does look good. It gives the impression of a luxury watch alright. However, upon taking a closer look you start seeing the flaws such as the misspelling on some words. I just got mine and it already was late 20 minutes after wearing it for about 3 hours, but I went back to the instructions and it kind of touched on the subject. It basically said to wind it really well before using. So, I'mma do that and see what happens. Overall, good looking watch. Addendum: it is not water resistant. Yesterday during a light rain it got fogged up. Beware!"
3.0,Overall a pretty good figure. You can find it around $100-$120. Be careful with the glasses. They are difficult to put on. He does come with the &#34;Loki Glow-Stick of Destiny.&#34; It's a nice figure. Makes Banner's face a little full. Yet worth a $100.
3.0,Fits well the color however was different than ordered
3.0,"Beautiful and very stylish!  Sadly, the magnet holding it together broke the first day."
3.0,it really runs small go up a size are 2  but it looks nice less are a bit large at the bottom \had to send it back didn't t work for me
3.0,The shirt was tight in the arms and across the shoulder but loose everywhere else. Sizing up would have made it look like a bag on. Got it for $9.99 so  I’ll keep and see how it holds up. Material and pattern are very nice.
3.0,Just got this for Christmas and it is already ripped
3.0,Broke fast...sorry Amazon🙄🙄
3.0,"These sleep shorts were great until after a wash or two the elastic in waist band twisted.  I worked and worked to get it untwisted because it is uncomfortable once it twists up and I am close to getting it corrected.  I think I will get it fixed but am frustrated to have to worry about that when I wash them from now on.  Otherwise, they are cute and soft and fit well."
3.0,"I purchase the tie dye along with solid colors. I haven’t worn the red yet, but the black fit perfectly. There is an add inner layer in the tie dye shirt, and it was far too small for my chest (36DD). The color is beautiful, but I will have to return."
3.0,Have gone through it about 3 times now there will be strangers with these hats you will eventually find your true size and you will end up with that that is quality made and crafted just be ready for the roller coaster ride.
3.0,The size was way smaller than the actual size printed on the clothing. My son is size 5 and the clothes looked like a size 3.
3.0,"MANAIXUAN Women's V-Neck Bell Sleeve Chiffon Leopard Print A-line Dress<br /><br />Meh, for a small it is very large, like maternity clothes. I’m 5’2” and it’s down to my calves, very unflattering. I added a belt which helps a lot, but the neckline could be more shaped and open; looks a bit matronly for me. It is double lined but they’re both sheer, and because of the large blousey tent then I’d definitely wear a slip or bike shorts. The fabric is thin and synthetic, which is fine but it’s just not flattering on a small figure."
3.0,"Works great except logo decal on left side fell off day one.  I now have 3 small holes in the side frame where the logo once was attached.  So far they work great in all wind environments.  They can fog quickly and easily but once wind or breeze is introduce or sliding them down your nose 1/2 inch, they clear quickly."
3.0,"The wallet itself is pretty, but I was unaware that the credit card slots weren’t deep or cut perfectly for your cards. Also I only used this wallet for a few days and the plastic part hanging off of the zipper fell off."
3.0,not the best looking the neck line is not how it looks on the picture
3.0,The finish on the heel stared peeling off after the first time my daughter wrote them; after a couple of wears we noticed the front of the shoe was peeling off too—we stopped using them shortly after buying
3.0,"I like the scarf just fine, nice quality and pretty. But I wanted an infinity scarf and this was not an infinity scarf as advertised. That is why I am rating it 3 stars."
3.0,"I'm 5'8"" and 110 lbs, ordered a large. Love the material, style, and general fit but the sleeves are so short!"
3.0,Somewhat cheaply made. Boxie and unflattering when just left hanging out. But tucked in and sleeves rolled up it’s ok (gotta have a pretty flat belly to achieve the look.) Color is bubblegum-wow.  Won’t bother to return but don’t expect to get much wear out  of it.  Collar is great so creative layering might be an option.
3.0,I want this product but not damaged please send me a replacement
3.0,"They're OK, and just as pictured.  Easy to wear."
3.0,Bought this as a Christmas gift.  Looks like the photo but is not the best quality.  I suspect it will not hold up after a few washings
3.0,cool for the cheap price. its not thick its thin. It looks really cute on. I should have purchased more than one.
3.0,"Fits okay, but mine didn't have the R with the circle around it, makes me wonder if it is fake."
3.0,"I really wish I could love this and the other pattern dresses I bought. They fit perfect and ideal for what I needed them for- but oh the material they are made of keeps you very hot and uncomfortable.  If you live in a hot area, even with it being sleeveless- it will be hot and uncomfortable .<br />Disappointed!"
3.0,The lining is not sew in good enough. When you put your hand in you have to redirect the lining into the fingers
3.0,A little shorter than I would have liked
3.0,Do not like how it flare.
3.0,Cute but really hard to use and makes the body part you put them on sore
3.0,Grandpa jacket but it’s keeps me warm amen that’s what really matters
3.0,Nice construction. Haven't verified RFID blocking but I presume it works. Problem is the wallet is HUGE. Like 30% taller than a regular watch. Barely fits in my pocket.
3.0,This is a snapback hat. You cant see it from the images the company posts. Its also jist a patch sewn on a black hat not actual stitching.
3.0,"This print came in a non-stretchy material opposed to the solids, small was too tight, whereas medium in solid was too loose.  I am 5'7&#34; 142#"
3.0,"Value for the money, yes. Is the watchband comfortable?  Yes<br /> It is comfortable but  it does not allow the skin to breathe under the watchband.<br /> My problem, when I was out in the sun the lens due to bright sunlight , the whole watch face turned into a black dot.  The only way to get the black dot to go away was to go inside and take the watch out of the sun then it became legible."
3.0,this is very hard to get a credit card out of the pockets
3.0,"I got this item for a discount for an honest review. I love this brand because their sunglasses are different, how different? They have a plastic rubbery feeling to them like it won't break as easy. I do have different pair that I feel in love with but my son lost them. So I got these but yes a but they don't feel the same as the other kind I got. Idk I got these thinking the will be flexible but they aren't so be careful  :("
3.0,You can tell its a cheap uniform
3.0,These gloves are definitely not for the winter.  My hands got very cold.  They also didn't fit me very well.  I have small hands so the gloves kept slipping off. Will be giving them away.
3.0,Ok... The Pros: This shirt feels nice. It seems well made. It's light and comfortable. The material is perfect. I got a 4x and the fit is right on for me.<br />The Cons: It definitely doesn't have the appealing look on me as it does on the thinner model. Maybe that's why they used her and not a plus sized girl. It just looks plain. Kinda like just a t-shirt you'd pick up at Walmart for way less. I just personally don't feel like the price is worth the shirt. It's more like a $10 shirt. Also it's a little short in the front so if you are a big girl with a little bit of a lower belly that you like to keep covered - it just barely does it.<br /><br />That being said - I won't be returning the shirt. I'll totally wear it. It's very comfortable. I'm thankful to have been gifted it. I got it in black. I'll probably wear it mostly around the house.
3.0,Bulkier than expected and fits larger than expected.
3.0,"I've been looking for a more breathable fabric for my masks that I can wear at work for hours at a time without having trouble breathing or getting hot. I read the reviews and the product description and I figured with the higher price range that it would be worth a shot. Unfortunately as far as breathability and thickness goes, it is no different than the masks I've bought elsewhere for much cheaper. The ability to adjust the size with the cinches on the ear loops is a nice touch but other than that, I do not find any relief or improvement from any of the other basic masks out there."
3.0,"i bought these for a camping party with lots of kids and adults. the ones that worked were a hit. half of them didn't work, or only worked for a VERY short time."
3.0,"fit ok at first, then the collar really stretched out. not sure I would buy it again"
3.0,"The fabris is kind of odd ... feels more like spandex than cotton.  It seems a little small, sleeves are tight ... but that said, it looks like the picture, and I'll wear it.  :)"
3.0,The left sleeve is patterned a little weird. The Material seam is on the outside instead of the inside of the shoulder.
3.0,Top is too big
3.0,Super think material and it was short on my arms but it was soft.
3.0,You can see the stitch lines pretty easily to the point it almost looks inside out. The print quality isn't the best either. It is okay for what it is. A funny cat dress.
3.0,Looked good but did not work out since hinge on one would not fasten. Dealer had no problem with return which was fast & easy.
3.0,Fell off my keychain within days
3.0,Battery came dead
3.0,"The earrings is very beautiful, but I am disappointed by this order did not included the gift box"
3.0,I have a small head and it did not fit. It was also too small for my friends 9 year old daughter that I gave it too.
3.0,It’s very comfortable but way more ‘bouffant’ than I wanted. I even tried pulling my hair back and putting it in the cap to try and weigh it down but it didn’t work. My coworkers told me I looked like a chef. Other than that it is made well.
3.0,Does not cut down on sun glare. Maui Jims are much better.  The hardware is more durable.
3.0,Very cute but the sequin stabs
3.0,It fits good but it's not very flattering. I wear a shirt over it so all you see is the shorts.
3.0,Picture not as cute in person.
3.0,"Didn't fit but I'm ordering a smaller size,I loved the shorts Disappointed that they was too big."
3.0,"I took these on a 12 day trip and they are great for packing except the zippers. It was annoying the zippers would pull unevenly and it was a hassle to realign. Light weight, but will replace in due time, with better product."
3.0,"I followed chart measuring instructions, had to return because to small. Good qualify would have re ordered but wouldn’t have arrived in time for my event."
3.0,Clear three pair good
3.0,Prefer a different fabric  Also had unusual scent like laundry 🤔
3.0,Disappointed that it is softer on the outside than on the inside.
3.0,"There is a huge logo on the left side of the front, it is not shown in the product image.  I thought surely it was a removeable sticker but no, it's permanent.  Returning!"
3.0,These bands were too narrow for the Fitbit Inspire 2. They work but the narrowness made them uncomfortable for me.
3.0,"I am very glad to have received the wand, but there were problems with it. One the wood, was very weak, however sturdy. Two, the wand came snapped into two pieces, which disappointed me the most, however the wand was beautiful and exactly like the the image. I'm also glad that there are no other problem with the wand."
3.0,"Gorgeous color, but if you're on the taller side (I'm 5'7) it fits more like a crop top length wise."
3.0,The product was not the color as described product dark gray received very light gray
3.0,Very sheer and fits awkwardly.  I think the sewing is just off completely.  It'll do for pool days to just throw on.
3.0,"Runs very wide, but most of these style sandals do run wide.  Pretty shoe, but I have very narrow feet."
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but unfortunately the fabric was so thin it felt more like a nightgown."
3.0,"Kids and small faces, it’s Perfect"
3.0,I love the dress!  Absolutely beautiful and the size is right on spot.  Giving them a three because the dress has a small X stain on the back if not for that I would give them a five star rating.
3.0,"Fairly comfortable, loose fit top. Wish the sleeves were slightly shorter, but otherwise fits fine. Top is soft though the leopard print part of the top is a different material than the rest- wish it was of the same material as I think that would make it even more comfortable. Overall, it’s a good option for something inexpensive, casual, and cute for days you want to look put together without trying too hard."
3.0,"The blouse is light and very cool, however you can see through the material and the back is longer than expected. The fit is good."
3.0,"I do love them don't get me wrong however, I was hoping I could just leave on like sterling and wanted it more shiny which is why I thought I'd try this platinum overlay but unfortunately I have to take out as my ears start to hurt - but I'll still wear for short time  - very pretty"
3.0,Very simple to use. Got 4 med and 4 large bags. I tried the large bag with a set of track suit and it did compress but I dont think it really helps with saving the spaces on a luggage. Tried one medium bag with just a pant and it did compress really well but still not really efficient to save space in the luggage. It is really good to compress clothes and store it away as it will keep the clothes clean and occupy less space but I don't think its suitable for saving space while traveling
3.0,"They're super cute and I got them for my toddler daughter who loved putting my glasses on. Sadly, they did not last long."
3.0,I didn’t realize the contrast in the fabrics and wish it had pockets. But it’s comfortable and fits as expected.
3.0,"Amazing strap base ruined by terrible leatherette attachments. I would recommend only to someone handy enough to make replacements upon getting it, as the glue that binds it at the entry point rubs all over the guitar finish and makes a mess.<br /><br />I’ve done so, and just stitched on new attachments, because the actual fur strap itself is excellent. Just an annoying mixed bag."
3.0,"I wasn't all that impressed with the quality and they are not as warm as the old gloves they were to replace. They are a little tight but the leather will stretch.  The leather itself is quite thin and looks to be pieced leather. I will keep them but I followed up by ordering black leather gloves at FOX Creek which is they best leather anywhere.  Very warm and very durable.  I have a pair of motorcycle gauntlet gloves I bought at Fox Creek 7 yrs ago and they are just like new. This time, I ordered short gloves for driving the car in the cold winter. They are worth the extra $20."
3.0,"Standing they seem short but fine. Sitting, these shorts disappear into places unknown and bind up. Wrinkles everywhere after sitting. Need to be pulled down along legs after rising. Will not purchase again."
3.0,"Beautiful fabric and very high quality shirt. However, it is not slim fit as pictured. It is very boxy and baggy. It is not flattering at all. Looks like it is for a pregnant person. I am hourglass shaped and this will not work for me."
3.0,"These are very nice gloves and are<br />packaged beautifully, but the size/shape is a bit odd.<br />I normally fit XS/S, so based on reviews indicating that these run small, I ordered Small (the smallest size listed). The gloves fit well in the palm and for finger width, but the finger length is unusually long. To fit these well, you would need thin hands with fingers disproportionately long for your hands. Otherwise, the fingertips are empty and fold over, making these beautiful gloves awkward and unusable, especially for touchscreen purposes.<br />Before posting a review, I reached out to the company to inquire about sizing but got no response, even beyond the 2 business days they indicated.<br />5 stars for quality, aesthetics, and comfort<br />3/4 stars for warmth (these should be alright for 40 degrees and up but definitely won't cut it for more than a few minutes in temperatures in the 20s or lower)<br />2 stars sizing (5 stars for the narrow fit, 0 star for the really long fingers)<br />0 stars for no response to my inquiry"
3.0,I am 5’4 134lbs ordered a size medium and I couldn’t get my head through the neck hole even. Hope this helps someone else. Ordering an XL as it was that small.
3.0,The image on the mask are nice and clear and bright. Fabric is a bit thick. The mask is very well made.
3.0,The dyed paint melts when it meets water
3.0,"Great looking bracelet, heavy and substantial, with a brushed finish, but I am not happy with the screws that hold the links together. After less than two months of use, one of the screws worked its way loose and the watch dropped off my wrist. I was able to catch the watch before it hit the ground, but THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. I have had other bracelets held together with friction collars and pins or with spring pins, and have never had a problem with them. The screws seem inferior. I reattached the bracelet and applied some thread locker. We'll see if that holds."
3.0,I knew it would be toddler size but not as small as it came. All my daughter could fit in it was a lip gloss and some dollars. Size of a coin purse.
3.0,Looks as nice as my Skagen watch at a fraction of the price.  But battery is impossible to replace without going to a jeweler.
3.0,Ordered a small but they were too big on me and I wasnt too fond of the material.
3.0,i ordered red and got pink so had to take pink off and sew red to late to send back.package even said red. but not very happy but worked after i fixed it.
3.0,"I think the fit was affected by the material. I liked the outfit just not the material. It was thin, fragile and see through. I might try another color but the white didn't even look white."
3.0,To cheap looking
3.0,This is a beautiful bracelet and I love the way it fits however there are several stones that are not glued in all the way and they are quite easy to notice
3.0,Made for a basic size Boob. I ordered larger than I needed but we busted at the seems.
3.0,"The material is very thick tshirt material. It doesn’t have much give and it’s a bit scratchy. Also the writing in the front is printed a bit off center and a bit tilted so it’s not very straight. I’m just using it for a mannequin so whatever, but if it was for ME to wear, I would return it."
3.0,i didnt like that the pink gummybear earing was clear? and the boba u cant even see the balls overall they were cute and funky.
3.0,Does not come with the gift packing shown<br />I bought this as a gift thinking it included the packaging shown in the photo but ended up returning it because it just came in a plastic bag with none of the gift wrap items shown. Ended up getting a way nicer and even engraved leather lanyard with nice  packaging for even cheaper on another website. The material here is decent but it’s not worth $30 and the hook park felt kind of cheap.
3.0,"Unlike some other reviewers, I actually like saffiano leather. It's a leather that is coated and has a crosshatch pattern on it which makes it spill, dirt and rip resistant which I like. This definitely feels like authentic saffiano leather. If you've never felt saffiano leather it is a stiff leather it's not going to feel buttery smooth and soft like pebble or smooth grain leather. The reasons I'm returning the wristlet are 1. too few card slots and no bill slot (the company has changed the design of the wallet but failed to update the listing and some of the photos). It only has 3 cards slots which they say you can double up but I would rather have at least 6-8 card slots in a horizontal layout which allows for a bill slot behind it. 2. The color I received was a very muted brown, really more beige than brown and that's not what I wanted. If you continue to make the saffiano verision then make the colors more saturated and bring back the 6 individual card slots and bill slot."
3.0,The laced were not wide. They were also not waxed at all. They are just basic cotton laces.
3.0,"1st. I love the dress. I purchased it in red, xl. Its a soft fleece material almost like a sweatshirt. It has a good stretch and is well made. 2nd it is described as being able to be worn off the shoulder. It is not. It is a small crew neck. But because I like how it feels and gives a casual look, I'll keep it."
3.0,It looked nice.. but the die was much too small
3.0,These fit like a glove and I absolutely love the theater waistband
3.0,Great for my tops
3.0,I've had other UPF products that worked great on a cruise and were cool to the touch.<br /><br />I ride a scooter as my main transportation and while I wear a riding jacket my hands were starting to show sun damage.<br /><br />I can't stand gloves or anything that covers the palms of my hands because I lose to much tactile feedback - this design was about my only choice.<br /><br />The design is fine but I'll definitely look for something in a different fabric - too hot.
3.0,gives major camel toe for wife
3.0,Good for the occasion
3.0,Not my most favorite item I've purchased from Amazon. They look very cheap and the gold faded within a day
3.0,"Nice material.  Beware, it has a collar."
3.0,Too big for me.. gawdy.
3.0,The dress is a nice dress. I am about 175 lbs and ordered a large it is too big. It runs big so I will order another.
3.0,A regular clasp or lobster hook would have been better/more secure in genuine silver. Color of pearls are nice. Took some time to arrive
3.0,"Cheap quality, the ring by the lace fell off. But are comfortable and look nice."
3.0,"Not bad , the color its not the same in picture ."
3.0,"This is a four star bag but I have to give it three because I am not thrilled about the price. I feel like a fair price would have been less than half what I paid for it. The good news is, it is well made, well sized and easy to pack away and have on hand for those souvenirs you want to bring home. Also good overnight bag or carry on bag."
3.0,"This sweatshirt is not as heavy as the one we had purchased years ago made by Russell Athletic, seemed a lot thinner."
3.0,Trying to take it in but mot having the best luxk
3.0,I expected this to be tight like it should but its not<br />I ordered according to the size chart.
3.0,"Muy fácil de ensuciar, hay que estarlo limpiando"
3.0,It runs small. Order size up. It’s nice looking shirt however the material makes you sweat .
3.0,"The outfit fit my little one ok, but the quality wasn’t great."
3.0,"Was looking to replace my mnt hardware belt after losing the clip.  Sadly, this belt falls short.  Fastener is difficult to remove and impractical for casual use.  I never wear it"
3.0,"Calling it a sweatshirt is misleading...the fabric has that shiny, slick, rather cheap polyester look and feel much more than spandex or cotton. It is unlined and extremely thin. In the light you can see through the white parts, so you really can’t wear it without a layer underneath. If I’d bought it for me, I’d be disappointed. My teenaged son has less discerning tastes, however, and is a big Bleach fan. He loves it, and that’s what matters. I will say the design is awesome. The fit is fine. My skinny 5’7” kid wears a small."
3.0,LOOKS LIKE LEATHER. STAINLESS STEEL CLASP. ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THE METAL CLASP AFTER USE WITH WATER LOOSES ITS GLUED AND SEPARATES FROM THE REST OF THE BRACELET. GLUED IT BACK AND LOOKS GOOD AGAIN. GOOD SIZE. MASCULINE. FAST SHIPPING.
3.0,"Great shirts, my 2 year old loved them, but they run small for sure. Buy a bigger size."
3.0,It came folded in quarters. Too small for my big head. A little floppy for my taste. I thought it would be a little stiffer. My teen daughter likes it though.
3.0,Cool but the gold necklace the gold comes off with sweat
3.0,"This bralette is very cute! Looks nice under shirts. I am size 32a, so the small is a bit big on me. I prefer to wear a bra underneath it (if I don't my breasts look flat! Never good.)"
3.0,OK for the price. The quality of the lenses do not compare at all with Maui Jim glasses.
3.0,It wasn't worth the price for what it was supposed to do.  I returned it because it was too small even though I used the size chart to order.  I didn't see any noticeable difference in posture control or very little. It does not keep one from slouching unless you constantly think about it which is the same without it.
3.0,"I waited so long for the product, but was disappointed. The promise as in the video you see the pen draw from a distance, it's just not like that.<br />Too bad we did not mention it otherwise especially in a promotional video not something"
3.0,The material is fine and did not shrink. The zipper though is cheap and comes separated easily.
3.0,"Material is okay, no very stretchy. Definitely runs smaller."
3.0,"Love th dress, its just too short and has very small arms on it.  It is very cute, but questionable fit."
3.0,"These are very cute, but are thin. They're perfect for a cutesy gift but can't hold up to regular wear & tear. after 6 or 7 washes and dries my husband's shirt was destroyed. The women's shirt is soft but very thin."
3.0,Way small I got the 3x and it fits like a large
3.0,Tighter around the body than I had hoped. Not comfortable because it’s too tight but it is pretty.
3.0,"I should've listened to the reviews, it was weird....don't get it."
3.0,Ordered a large and they fit more like a medium.
3.0,"Doesn't seem to have the same quality as the Oakley brand. Need the same impact resistant lens as the original, concerned it may not deliver."
3.0,"These shorts should be labeled as slim cut. My husband has always worn a size 36, but these size 36 were too small on the waist and cut tight on the legs. We returned them."
3.0,"I love it, even got compliments on it, but I noticed my ear was hurting as if i had just got it pierced. I thought it was because i hadent had a earring in it for some months. When i took it out i noticed my ear was keloiding around it. It was to small."
3.0,Not a fan of the fit. It's boxy.
3.0,Good. But too long.
3.0,"Fits perfect! Alot see through,Sexy!<br />Bad news fell apart after on wash.."
3.0,This was thinner then I expected. For a sturdy heavy activity bra I expected it to be thicker and stronger.
3.0,"Really wanted to like these, they looked nice, especially for the price but already have 5 pieces that fell out on the first use."
3.0,"nice fit and feel, but the black dye in the pants discolored our white cotton sheets.  Hope to get it out with soaking, otherwise will need to use Rit color remover. Did not expect this!"
3.0,Can't wear them for long periods as they press down on my head.  Good sound protection but wish they were more comfortable.
3.0,Massive!!!
3.0,The lenses are bit larger than expected. Nice for eye protection but aren't as &#34;stylin&#34; as desired.
3.0,miniscule and not for adults.
3.0,I'll give it a 3 because it's pretty. But wayyyyyyy tooooo big. I'll give it away. The lace is a little off color in places too. But I could overlook that. The size tho. Not wearable for me.  I could make 3 cover ups out of it. So don't even think of ordering unless your at least size 18+ DDD. I'm a 4.
3.0,"very nice!  My only problem is with delivery, they left it on the floor at my door instead of knocking..."
3.0,"it was ok, but i didn't like it"
3.0,It's a bit too tight.  Nice pattern.  Took a while to get it and one day there it was in my mailbox!
3.0,"main gem fell off after putting it on, easily repaired with hot glue gun."
3.0,"Material is thin, but the shirt fits nicely. I bought a size up and it was prefect."
3.0,They kept falling out of my daughter's ears because they didn't stay closed.
3.0,One of the two pair I got the back post was bent clear over to the side.  The other pair were perfect.
3.0,"As a Sailor Moon fan I was excited to find an affordable knock off of this purse. It’s a bit on the smaller size, the strap is sewed backwards and I wish the strap was a bit longer. It’s cute for short term use but not big enough to use all the time."
3.0,"Wrong size given. I understand there foreign sizes.. Usually the ""70"" is 3-6 months.. I received a ""90"" which is like at least 12m or larger. Cute outfit just wrong size completely."
3.0,Fit super weird.
3.0,"Our daughter 2.5, wears a 3T in most clothes, ordered her a 2T and it was still too big. Needed the next size down but it was sold out."
3.0,Somewhat large. Panasilk silk bikini underwear size large is slightly bigger than needed for wife who wears size 7 underwear. The larges will probably fit up to a size 9 or 10 comfortably. Elastic has a lot of stretch room so these are a little baggy for my size 7 wife. Ordered the medium size and it was slightly tight on her. The paradise silk brand size large fits her perfectly:)
3.0,I really wanted to love this set but it falls short of expectations. The print is super cute but the pants are not very soft and unfortunately do not stay up. The sports bra has a different clasp that makes it difficult to fasten.
3.0,was VERY small on the waist and short on me since I am 5'9&#34;. Beautiful skirt otherwise!
3.0,"I fell in love with this set when I first saw it. I ordered it because I was in need of a wedding band, as I got married in may 2012, and my original engagement ring no longer fit(at the time). I was so excited to get it in the mail. Then it came and disappointment hit. The ring was still very pretty, however, one of the stones on the band was broken. Another on the ""engagement ring"" doesn't sit right in the setting. Some of the stones in the band are cramped together while there are gaps at each end. On top of it, the sides of the settings aren't straight at all. At a glance you don't really see any of the flaws, but given the chance to study the ring and you pretty much notice every flaw right away. In all honesty, if it weren't for one stone being broken and another not sitting right, I would have given this set a 5."
3.0,these fit well but the drawstring is basically useless.  I will be replacing it.
3.0,The bathing suit was too small up top and really tight on the bottom
3.0,ok quality but not great
3.0,"These are good for lounging around but not for exercise. The band became loose after only a couple of wears.<br /><br />Bottom line, would I repurchase? Yes but not to work out in."
3.0,I had to cut holes for the eyes.
3.0,A lot smaller than expected. Fits the ring.
3.0,not as good as I expected
3.0,These are very cute and seem to be well made but colors are off . Not dark pink as described and pictured
3.0,"Nice green color, very loose, room to grow I guess."
3.0,Could be bigger
3.0,"I received them but not as shown color in the description !!!<br />There are no orange, green, light blue !!"
3.0,ok for $16.00 Lets see how long it last
3.0,Garment is decent....OK.
3.0,"Cute, but cheaply made.  Then again they weren't expensive and nice to just throw some extra in your car!"
3.0,"I didn't like the material. Plus, It was not a good it at all."
3.0,Took a few months for delivery . Cheap price and look .
3.0,"Great texture, MUST be washed before use, quite small for the amount of hair that most women have. We let our daughter use it when she wants to act like Mommy."
3.0,Looks good. Decent workmanship. A bit too small. No heat at the shoulders contrary to picture.
3.0,"I'm 5'5&#34; 135 lbs., and I ordered a Medium which did not fit right. I probably should have ordered a Small. The pants were 3&#34; or 4&#34; too long. The top wasn't too big on me, just awkward. You see, I wear empire waist tops frequently (in daytime wear), but I've found that they're not ideal for pajamas. The empire waist on the top fell mid-boob. That means the seam was right around the sensitive nipple area, and it was uncomfortable. I could pull the stretchy fabric down every 5 seconds so that the seam was under my boob, but that's impractical while sleeping. I suppose if I slept with a bra or undershirt, maybe that seam wouldn't have been so uncomfortable. The top also has an extra flap of fabric which is what hangs down in a flowy manner under the empire waist, so I was surprised about that (though it was fine).<br /><br />The fabric is soft and stretchy which is nice. I still wear the pants (but have gotten rid of the top), and I've noticed after many washes that the fabric has begun to show those little balls from wear and tear. So these might not be as long-lasting as I had hoped."
3.0,Clasp fell apart the first time I wore it
3.0,"I liked that it is dainty but the stone encasement didn't look well secured, like one swipe of the hand getting caught on something and it would bust off.  Sadly returned it."
3.0,Not the best dress for women with large breasts. The cut out hits in a very risky type way instead of just being classy sexy. My friend that’s the same size as me with medium size boobs fit it perfectly though.<br />I’m 5’7 with size 10 with 36DD
3.0,Material is not like true &#34;biker&#34; shorts material as I expected. It's more knit.
3.0,"Update: second pair didn’t have a hole but still not as good as quality as I expect from Stance.<br /><br />Original: One of them came with a hole in the back, and a dozen rips in the top layer."
3.0,Love this; it's so cute! I only took it off my phone because the gem nose made my phone not be able to lay flat on a table and it drove me crazy.
3.0,too thick for summer
3.0,This is not a very soft socks. And the knitting quality is not that good.
3.0,"Love that they are lined, but did not hold up well."
3.0,"I wear it on my index finger and I've learned the hard way not to rub an itch on my nose with that finger. It's an uncomfortable scrape rather than a cut, but that's not at all the experience I thought my money would be buying."
3.0,It's ok for the price just looked a little cheap no real shine like the picture.
3.0,I haven't worn it yet; but I've tried it on and it seems to fit well. I am 5'3&#34; and about 125 lbs. I ordered a small/med based on the input of other purchasers.
3.0,Doesn’t fit good
3.0,Dress this up or down! I love them and purchased several this summer! Wore them with kimonos and sandals. I plan to wear them to work as well with some slip on mules and a long sweater. I’m 5’5” and usually wear a 12/14 and I bought both the L and XL sizes. Both fit fine - just had a little looser fit in the XL - I kept both since I didn’t mind it. Can be worn with a Jean jacket too- great piece to build on.
3.0,They're cute for what I need them for.  I wish they hadn't been so expensive but they'll work.  I probably should have shopped around a bit more.
3.0,"The price is right and there is nothing wrong with these gloves, but my daughter who is in outdoor schooling in the Northeast said ""they don't do anything to keep my hands warm"" and it's only about 45 degrees F....so if you really want some warmer gloves or mittens better go for wool or insulated...or maybe ok for that small window in the  high forties to low sixties when your child might want gloves..."
3.0,"A little transparent in the chest area and quite difficult to find a bra or tank top to wear under, mostly due to the fit. I ordered a large and I'm 5'3&#34; approx 190lbs with 38DD chest size and hold most of my curves in my lower half, this fit fine other than the chest area.. I did have to shorten the dress about 6 inches or so but that seems to be normal for most longer dresses. It works but it isn't fantastic."
3.0,"The bill of the hat is too long. It also seems that the downward angle of the bill from the body of the hat is too steep. If I put the hat on my head level the bill completely blocks my vision. The body of the hat is on the back of my head touching my neck when the bill is level. However, other than that, the hat fits my very large head well and for what it cost it is a good purchase for the money."
3.0,"•Seller did update description since my purchase.<br /><br />Bought 2 of these bracelets for a costume being that it was marketed as a arm cuff. Thinking they would fit my teenaged niece's upper arm, I was a bit disappointed that they would only fit her wrist. Nonetheless, this is a good bracelet. The bracelet is a highly polished, silver toned, metal. They are adjustable enough to fit a wider wrist. I would have awarded 5 stars if the description were correct."
3.0,"kinda cheap, but they work for work undies, alittle weird because the tag is on the outside of them all, like on the back sewed on after the fact or something. it's strange."
3.0,To long and i am 5'5
3.0,"I loved the blue and white stripes and functioning buttons. I bought this for family photos on the beach. It was way too small in the chest. I had to use a safety pin and even that didn’t work so I returned it. If the dress were true to size, I’d love it."
3.0,Earrings are cheaply made and way too large and don't look like they appear online. Would not recommend this item.
3.0,Not great quality but honestly based on the price it serves its purpose. Smelled like eggs when it came though.
3.0,These were for my daughter and she said they are really narrow at the top. Pretty shoe though!
3.0,"Got this for my boyfriend so he could have a breathable band and it does the job. And it looks nice. However, we ordered red and black but it’s actually orange. Not sure if they sent us the wrong on or if it’s just orange. We took a picture next to a red pot holder and an orange backpack for reference."
3.0,not really what I had expected
3.0,These are cute but very cheap. The ends are wrinkles on some of them.
3.0,I love the comfortable fit of the ring. The stone however was very light. I expected more color. I am familiar with moonstone so I knew what I was purchasing.
3.0,"It's very see through. I usually wear small, got a small but it fit very fitted around the hips... and since it's see through and a weird material it emphasizes dimples and panties a lot. May cut it in half and make it a shirt instead. I would say go a size up if you want it to fit like in the picture (somewhat loose)"
3.0,"The ones we got are well made, simple and easy to wear, they are comfortable and we get lots of compliments.<br />However, there were ZERO septum rings included, they are featured heavily in the photos, but were not included in the package. Pretty disappointing."
3.0,Decent dress for the price. Material is a little thin but overall a decent work dress.
3.0,"Served its purpose for Halloween, but the headband broke on the 3rd day of use. The foam on it is also very cheap looking, and came with creases and other imperfections."
3.0,"I love the style and color. Very cute, but they are see through"
3.0,"If you are looking for an affordable suits, this may just work for you but keep in mind that the pants still needs to be hemmed so if you or someone you know, knows how to do it without costing you anymore expense, you may just be satisfied with it otherwise you are better off purchasing another suits finished or somewhere else where you don't spend anymore money taking it to alterations.  The price does reflect the quality of material as it is thin and even just by touching it, the feel of it says about the price being cheap...  I hope this review helps..."
3.0,Really soft however neckline is deeper than it looks in the picture. The material is very thin.
3.0,"Nice, fit well. Fabric is kind of itchy. Will do nicely for casual outings or beach trips. CHEAP SO."
3.0,ok shoes. wouldn't buy again. they slip off.
3.0,Color is pearl not white
3.0,"Really long, not very flattering, although I am built like a potato."
3.0,"Thought this would be a good way to organize for my backpacking trip. However, my bras did not fit as shown in the picture. Turned out not to work for me so I had to return it. Guessing it might fit up to a C cup."
3.0,Liked everything about this product but it just didn't fit right.  Bought both a L and XL to get the right size.  Both were cut in a way that it didn't fit across the upper chest and shoulders right.  Had to send them back.
3.0,Using as a cover up.  Will work great!
3.0,"I take a large, which I ordered, it was WAY too long and I had a lot of space in he arms. I just couldn't make it work and had to return it."
3.0,"Nice, comfy and soft, but have holes around the elastic waste band."
3.0,"The Lady of Grace enamel came plate off of the base two days after it was added to a necklace.  It's lovely, but I wish better adhesive could have been used."
3.0,"Cute, but tiny. These were way too short and tight for my average size 4/5 child. Gave them away since returning them would’ve cost as much as shipping them here."
3.0,"Good fashion bag.  I like the construction (only issue was a thread that hadn't been clipped that was in a zipper when it arrived).  The faux leather doesn't look cheap, and is a good thickness.  The strap is a good length and adjustable (important in a crossbody style since I'm 6').  The color is great for Fall. I like that there are multiple functional compartments, and this will be great for travel.<br /><br />The negatives would be that the gold hardware (aside from the actual zipper parts - so the pull tabs, rings on the staps, etc) looks cheap.  Also, the lining is a bright pale pink with a black bow pattern.  It really detracts from the bag and makes it look like a budget item.  A solid color, inexpensive poly lining would have been a much, much better option.  I purchased this item because I was looking for a classic piece with a bit of boho flair, not a cutesy teen knock off bag.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review."
3.0,The dress is super cute but it's very small on the chest area. I can't wear it.
3.0,I wore it for my birthday I am 5’2 203 pounds. It was very short and cute the only thing I had a problem with was the straps are not sewn down very good so one side broke. But fortunately I know how to use a sewing machine and it was a easy fix
3.0,The strap part on the shoulder is a little short so it makes a little awkward fit
3.0,"My 4 year old loves these shoes, but they run a bit big and she refused to let me return them because they were just what she wanted. She will grow into them and in the mean time I let her wear them around the house. My complaint is that the Velcro on the strap doesn't stay well at all. She's constantly having to close the strap back because it keeps popping off. I would recommend sizing down if you decide to purchase."
3.0,The chain is a beautiful looking chain but after a couple of months wearing it started changing color. It was dark in the crevices like black. I cleaned it but it keeps turning. I don’t know if I do recommend it?? I love how beautiful it is but it’s not worth it after a couple of months. It’s definitely not worth the price. It should be less.
3.0,"Waaaay too big. I used the size chart, and bought my size, and it's like 3 sizes too big."
3.0,Very disappointed...this is super cute but definitely not tts. It ran extremely small. returned for a full refund
3.0,I have not worn them outside but inside they are warm but not as I expected.  They are average.  Right now I am wearing one on one foot and another brand on the other foot to see if it is just me or blood flow issues with my feet!
3.0,It was smaller than the size I wear it however very pretty.
3.0,"top too large, bottom too small"
3.0,"GREAT QUALITY PRODUCT, BUT EITHER THEY WERE TAGGED WRONG OR BELONG IN THE BOYS DEPARTMENT. THEY WERE SMALLER THAN MY LARGE SHORTS OF THE SAME STYLE. THE QUALITY GETS 5 STARS..........."
3.0,Bottoms do roll around mid section .
3.0,The fur was too bulgy and big or bushy.<br />But the size fit of the hat was on the small side.
3.0,"They are nice just too big, and I was expecting them to have spandex, so I'm returning these and ordering a smaller size."
3.0,Did not like the polyester material and did not like style on me.
3.0,"Cute but cheaply made, the first time I wore the purse the chain strap snapped in half."
3.0,bit big but u can see it well lil heavy
3.0,The length and look is good but the dogtags feel as if they were made from plastic and they are very light but I guess you get what you pay for
3.0,It must run hit in size bc I got a large and wear and xl in tops usually. Medium bottom or I guess I’m short bc this goes passed my knees! It would be so cute otherwise too
3.0,"Bigger than expected and quality is not great. Definitely not a gift for someone! I used it for a costume so, it was ok."
3.0,Cute - love the sleeves - to sheer- fabric feels cheap!
3.0,"Like, but china"
3.0,"This ring is rose gold!! I think the description should be updated. I was looking for a yellow gold ring and fell in love with this one given that I love roses ... however, this was not yellow gold ... will keep for a present."
3.0,Wrong size but I can use them for several of my other piercings.
3.0,were ok
3.0,Design wasn't as photo. Had more white than the darker colors on a XL.
3.0,"If you're petite, this is not the ring for you. It's beautiful, but I had to return it because it over-powered my petite hand/finger."
3.0,Overpriced and when you bend it it immediately discolors to the base leather color.
3.0,La calidad de la tela no es muy buena y es una talla reducida
3.0,"The fit on this dress is very, very specific. I think it fits well on people who either very skinny or very curvy. I’m neither and the dress hung weirdly because my hips didn’t fill out the bottom but my upper body did. If I were skinnier, the entire dress could hang more loosely across the board so maybe the contrast wouldn’t be as obvious."
3.0,"The product is nice looking, but a bit undersized as compared to other similar products. Particularly, the jerseys are tight around the shoulder / arm area. Nice colors and design otherwise."
3.0,Did not like how wide the shoulders are and the material is pretty cheap. The snake pattern is very pretty and it is comfortable.
3.0,"This jacket is nice, but the material is very thick and heavy. If you want something lightweight, this is not it, but it’s definitely warm and heavy duty."
3.0,This is a thick T-shirt
3.0,The dress is soft and flattering but it arrived with no belt.
3.0,I really love these pajamas! The only thing is that the cuffs on the sweatshirt are too tight. I love everything about the pajamas besides that. I wish I would’ve bought a different pair!
3.0,"I ordered all to have the thumb hole but only the multi colors were the Solid were regular. The solid dont roll down but the multi colors do, and the multi colors dont go up as high due to the finger hole. I read it was for plus size in comments only the solid is, I wear 2x clothes and the multi were WAY too tight on my upper arm.. Wore the grean camo once and the elastic has come undone. I will admit they have the cooling to them where you wont be overheated. But not what I ordered and quality of the multi colored not the same as solids."
3.0,"Nice shirt, if you have any kind of muscular shoulders whatsoever size up!"
3.0,Bigger than I  expected  nice if you like big jewelry
3.0,It was really good but too small
3.0,"These socks are soft and comfortable but are problematic in that they are too tall to be ankle socks and too short to be crew socks, at least on me and I am average-to-short in height and leg length. Seller accepted return quickly and without problems."
3.0,"I’ll wear this around the house and that’s probably it. This dress runs rather large, making the mock neck loose. It was pretty huge on me, actually. The color is a little off and it’s t shirt material. I will say that the style is really nice even if it doesn’t look the way I had hoped with it on my body. Also, for those wondering, it’s not thin."
3.0,Cute And Well Made For The Price
3.0,"Not for long torso...fit was awkward, but likely looks great on shorter torso. :("
3.0,"I got a size Large, when I normally wear a Medium in t-shirts and other athletic type clothing. The black one fit the best, but sadly I had to sacrifice that one at the hospital when I broke my collarbone while wearing it. The red one fits the smallest and is the least stretchy of them all. I would size up twice if I had to purchase these again."
3.0,This dress I thought was cotton but its nylon.  It also is very long!  Not sure I'm going to keep it.  I do love the colors!
3.0,It feels durable but too stiff doesn’t seems like it’s gonna get softer doesn’t grip around the wrist it’s just straight worn it about a week and the little strips are fading
3.0,These fit way smaller than expected.  I won't return them though.  They are of good quality materials.
3.0,"It's cute, but super lightweight and tangles the strands easily."
3.0,"The cut of the armpits seemed to fit a little large on me and I'll have to get them altered in order to wear it, but I love the texture and design of this dress"
3.0,Color is not same in person as in the photo. Photo looks like a beige but in person looks very tan like light brown.
3.0,"Top looks nice, however it fits very small. Make sure you order a size bigger. Feel nice."
3.0,Product too small.
3.0,I ordered the largest size and was still a bit small for me in the arms. It also didn't close either.
3.0,These pants are very comfortable and they look really good. I'm usually a size 10 in pants but in the description it says to order a size down so I got a size 8. They fit good but I feel like they are still a bit loose and I could've gotten away with a size 6. They are ankle length as described so no surprises there. The reason why I got them was because I know nydj makes flattering clothing but I am not sure if these pants are. They fit and look good but I dont feel like they do anything slimming like they advertise. They are just like leggings but more expensive. I don't think that they are worth the price.
3.0,"Nice shirt, but a little loose for the size. Size down."
3.0,They don’t get very dark; Was hoping for more.
3.0,Smaller than I expected but very pretty. About the size of a dime.
3.0,Much thinner than I thought it would be
3.0,"Came as described mostly, the cups move around a lot so you have to arrange them ahead of time. Only real issue was the smell. Even after washing/wearing there’s a lingering smell of plastic."
3.0,I brought a pair of these wide face glasses a while back and they broke top of the frame I like the glasses so I brought two more pairs just because I can't find anything like them. So hopefully they last for a while.
3.0,It was such a shame an absolutely gorgeous dress but sizes run pretty small a 2XL( which is my size) was too tight.  Such a shame.
3.0,"Not really for outside use unless you are wearing a swimsuit with it. It’s super casual, but better suited for pajamas or more like beach wear. I was going to wear it to an all white party, but it was still way too casual because of the material and how see through it was. It’s soooo cute though. I almost kept it to wear around the house, but I didn’t need it."
3.0,"purchased an xl, the size chart says it should fit size 16/18; I wear a 14, but wanted it a little big on me, it's too small, I can't button it up, otherwise I like it. returning it for an xxl and hoping that works out"
3.0,Runs small.<br />Pretty style.
3.0,"Knocked off a star because the heather hunter green just looks gray, does not look olive or greenish at all like in the picture.  But i love this brand yoga pants.  They fit well and are not see-through when you squat/bend over.  These run a little large.  I normally wear a small for bottoms, but had to order down a size to an XS.  I have bigger thighs/butt and normally can't even get an XS on.  The size small kept creeping down, so I had to keep pulling them up all day - very annoying!  Switched to XS and they stay in place perfect."
3.0,Sizing definitely runs big and the material is not what i was expecting. Returning
3.0,"Little tighter than expected, suggest going with a size bigger than you'd think. Bought it for paintball and only used once, but the padding does help with hard slides."
3.0,Beautiful dress but way too small.  I am a size 8 and ordered a large which I am having to return because it fits too small.
3.0,"NICE BAG, but the long zipper gets stuck and is impossible to open or close. Had to pay $35 to  replace it."
3.0,"The demin apron fabric is great - I can see it's going to be quite durable, but the apron strings are like long shoelaces.... I ordered two aprons, and one had a snag in it upon arrival - sort of like an abrasion, so I think it's going to fail at that point.  I don't think the apron strings are going to hold up very long at all."
3.0,"It is not as warm as I thought for the  price. It is, however, very comfortable."
3.0,States xl 13-15 but fits like a 10-12 sock
3.0,"Everything fit nicely, but the sleeves were about 4&#34; too long!  I sent it back."
3.0,"Beautiful design.  I wear these in my daith piercing in my ear.  They are nice but this is a piece of jewelry that is made cheaply, so it will go &#34;green&#34; on you as it ages.  It also is easy to release in my ear due to the 'clicker' design, so I don't know that this is a slam dunk for a daith piercing.  Itch your ear without thinking, and it might just release and fall right out of the ear!  It looks pretty but for some might be too big for a daith piercing."
3.0,Loved the dress but way too small.
3.0,"i bought these with the purpose of being able to remove the straps, the image is incorrect. they’re the original sliders with the same straps. waste of money on my part . so lame"
3.0,I can see potential but it doesn’t sit right and the green I ordered which looks like a nice deep green is actually a teal. 5’4” 137lbs 34DD bought the large.
3.0,"The pants fit well, except they were about 6 inches too long so I had to take them in to get them shortened. I am 5'7"", and I ordered XXL knowing from past experience that the clothes made in China run small.  I have never had pants that long though, but overall I was happy with them."
3.0,Cute but top was a bit tight. I'm a 36dd
3.0,"the color was not even all around the ring, not a deal braker. nice ring fits well."
3.0,"This dress appears to look good on every Amazon reviewer. This was NOT the case for me. My hubby said I looked like I could be a greeter at Cracker Barrel! I laughed out loud because he was right! I am heavyset (18/20). And although the xxl fit was fine, the style didn't look good on me. I did love the stretch and feel of the material though. I would return it, but I missed the Amazon return deadline by one day! :-( maybe a belt will make it look better on me."
3.0,They fit but real tight I’d up size
3.0,I have had problems with getting the charms open to attach them to my bracelets. This piece did help even though it is still difficult.
3.0,Like the dress but it's a straight cut.  Need more room in the hips. Returning.
3.0,Nice shirt order size down
3.0,This skirt is beautiful but the waste is tight and the length is really long.
3.0,"These plugs are beautiful! Most of the pairs are quite pretty while a couple pairs were not that great to look at. The flare and wearable area is just too much for my ears. I ordered these in 00g (10mm) and the flare is just too big to even put in. Wearing glass plugs will help with that problem though so Iran not such a big deal. I just don’t like that they won’t sit flush against my ear and will instead stick out a bit from the front or back. On top of all that there are little scratches and chips on almost all pairs. Including in the wearable area. Those chips and scratches have the potential to cut your fistula and/or harbor bacteria.<br />Despite all that I still think these plugs are beautiful and great for the price, I’d definitely recommend these for people with larger ear size not so much for those at or below 00g"
3.0,The gem is very delicate and very pretty in the setting. Cannot review the remaining order because this was the only thing that arrived.
3.0,Not as wind proof as I hoped. And the grip in the palms is only average.
3.0,"This is a very nice bracelet., however, it doesn’t have the Sashka charm. I purchased a different bracelet for $6.99 and it looks like the very same bracelet. What makes this one so expensive?"
3.0,"Nice style. I really like the feel of the fabric. The front and back of the dress patterns are not aligned at all. This is an epic fail in quality; however, I will return and hope that I will get one that is more aligned. I will also go with a extra small versus a small because the small was too loose in the chest area."
3.0,Good quality but very transparent to do work out at the gym
3.0,Very cute pattern but the size is off. Runs small
3.0,is ok product for the price
3.0,"Love the color variety. But the polyester seems to attract hair, dust, etc.  The are a bit thin.  And run a little loose on the face."
3.0,"It’s really cute but the sizing is misleading. I ordered it for my niece as a Christmas present, advertised as a 6T. When it arrived, the tag said “5-6Y.” It looks small - we’ll see if it fits her. The skirt looks short but she may be able to wear it with leggings & make it work. The top looked proportionally longer & closer to a 6T than a 5. I’d order bigger next time to be safe."
3.0,Colors and material are great it's tighter in the belly area that I would realy like
3.0,Sizing is a bit small
3.0,Fit well but as most headbands a little tight behind the ear.  The red star had fallen off when I took it out the package which is why I rate it just okay.
3.0,go up two sizes the band is too small.
3.0,The reviews are correct. The actual product that you receive is a much darker purple than pictured. More of a very dark plum color. I'm ok with this however. The material is silky smooth as expected. I bought a couple for my bridesmaids to wear while getting ready so these will serve their purpose.
3.0,Dress was cute but way over sized & short.
3.0,I did not receive all the masks photographed in the advertising. Instead I got two of the fox masks. The main reason I ordered these was for one particular mask that was photographed  on the model laying on the rug in lingerie. I did not get that mask. I do like these masks though. Yes they are fabric but they looks cute on and fit nicely. Very cute.
3.0,The beads are not the same shade of pink as the gems. The beads look almost washed out in comparison. Decent for the price I paid.... but you get what you pay for. I included pictures for visual reference
3.0,much smaller than advertised.  I will keep them as backup.  OK quality
3.0,Runs 2 sizes too small. My 13 year old daughter normally wears a med in womens and we ordered a men's large so she could wear it as a sleep tee... it just fits her like a women's med shirt. So order at least 2 sizes bigger than normal.
3.0,They just need to adjust the measurements They are a little off.<br />Otherwise good value
3.0,Strap was missing to hold the umbrella closed. Also there’s a small tear at the seam other then that I love the umbrella!!
3.0,The waistband is uncomfortable on these. I would definitely go up a size.
3.0,"Es poco durable, poco mas de un año y ya se rompe. Por el precio q tiene deberia durar mas tiempo."
3.0,"Cute since it's only for one day where, you get what you paid for"
3.0,"I love the style, but their measurements in the size guide I feel are too small. I would definitely order a size larger for someone who’s heavier chested like myself. The material is good, little stretch, but it did not fit properly around my chest."
3.0,Seems like more of a mans cut in shoulders. Doesn’t shrink.
3.0,I absolutely love these pants and the length is perfect but I have bought 2 pair and both pair ripped right in the seam of the butt. Seams do not hold up well. I keep buying because I love them but I’m going to have to move on. Neither pair lasted more than a month.
3.0,Very nice face but after the first wear the leather band smelled terrible so have to replace it.
3.0,Product looks a little different than the picture.  But it's OK
3.0,"Handsome and durable, but the finish on the buckles is very slippery, and why is the white belt at least 4” shorter than the other 2? I bought the set for the white one, and yet I can’t wear it."
3.0,The dress itself is good. The fabric is a little heavy but good. It’s just too short for me. I’m 5’9” and it isn’t as long as I would like. Other than that it’s great.
3.0,"This is a nice watch band but it is not for adults, it is meant for teens or more like preteens since it is hardly possible to get on an adult hand. Then it is incredibly hard to fasten."
3.0,it was a gift.  unfortunately...it came loose and was lost.
3.0,Good quality and nice shirt but the lace wasn't sewn down (attached) at the bottom so it kind of flared and made me feel like I was wearing football pads. I returned it.
3.0,"I love the bracelet. I wish I could tighten it, and for that I have to give it 3 stars."
3.0,"Unfortunately, this did not work with my ear.  Obviously all ears and piercing locations are a bit different, but I really thought the cat's tail would be semi-flexible to adjust it.  It is not.  The cat is cute and it now hangs the side of my curtain rod, but just did not work as an earring for me."
3.0,wore it one day till the post (tail) came apart had to super glue it back together. quality could have been better. looked good on
3.0,"Pretty cool, but as soon as I got them they started falling apart. But, nothing scissors can't fix!"
3.0,"They seem nice, but alas don't fit over my glasses, which are average-sized (lenses a bit under 2 inches by 1 inch). If you don't have glasses or have very small lenses, they would probably do the trick. They're comfortable without glasses, but alas I cannot test-drive them without sacrificing my corrected vision. My three-star review is thus a bit arbitrary; just wanted to let folks with glasses know they might not work for them."
3.0,Too small for a 5year old. With a normal sized head lol maybe even a smaller head than normal.
3.0,They are cute but three of them broke just by taking them out of the bag
3.0,Color is pretty however the quality is poor after a month slippers tore from trying to walk and not fall they stretch out of place unless you have very wide feet you will find these to be big and you have to grip your feet to keep on when walking material faux fur is cute if these was a little tighter they would be perfect very disappointed I wanted to like but find these not comfortable
3.0,"After the first wash, the letters started peeling off. After 3 washes, the thread started coming out of the hem on the bottom of the shirt. I'm still wearing it but it is falling apart!"
3.0,"I agree with some other posts - the craftsmanship of the shoe is not very good.  They do, however feel like they will help foot/leg pain.  Should be constructed much better for the price."
3.0,Bag is cumbersome as an across the body bag.  The handles are a pain as I prefer a shoulder bag.
3.0,"It’s a cute dress and love the beige color, but the measurements are inaccurate."
3.0,Super cute and very flattering.  It is a little bit on the thin side.  I don't really want to have to wear a slip with it but I may have to.
3.0,These look and feel nice. Made well. Can’t breathe in them. Poor airflow especially if you add a filter. Need something to separate your mouth and nose from the fabric.
3.0,"Very pretty, vibrant colors on this mermaid bag. It was a gift and the little lady really liked it."
3.0,"I received 4 shorts. Black, Grey, Blue, & Red. The red fits the best followed the by blue. The grey is a bit snug and the black is really snug. They are all size L but all fit different. Other then that they are light material."
3.0,The opening to insert your glasses is really very narrow and was very hard to insert normal glasses handle.
3.0,definitely order as large as you can - when they say sized small they mean it
3.0,"I picked this 1 for the deep V, but it just wasn't the fit that I thought it would be. It's a lot of material. I was hoping for a party dress, my daughter said I looked like I was going to a funeral. I really wanted blue but there wasn't a large. So I went with the black. Guess I'll wear it somewhere one day. #ItsOk"
3.0,"Pretty disappointed, bought this for our announcement but specifically order the ""White+Blue"" because it looked like it mostly had blue flowers which is what I was looking for but alas it has pretty much No Blue and you can see from the pictures. The material is thinner but stretchy and soft. There are some sewing issues as it looks like the bottom cuff has loose sewing stiches hanging off it."
3.0,"I like these boot cuffs, however, the stitching was loose and unraveling."
3.0,"I like this, button would have been little larger so that they do not slip from button whole."
3.0,"Has a nice weight but still looks cheap to me, I love the picture way more than the product."
3.0,"Nice, but too large~"
3.0,"I have done lots of sewing in my life and the first thing I noticed when I got this dress is that the skirt was not sewn on straight.  Obvious when the skirt is a plaid.  No attempt made to match pattern in seams of skirt.  The fabric is a nice mid-heavy weight knit blend and the dress is comfortable.  The khaki plaid is attractive.  The waist is high on this, not at the natural waistline.  I am short, 5'3"", 28in inseam and this dress makes me look dumpy.  I will not be keeping this."
3.0,"I bought one from Israel and the quality of the opaline was much better then this one.  I gave it to my 5-year-old granddaughter and she loved it.  Due to the reasonable price, I am not worried if she breaks or loses it.  It's a<br />perfect gift for any religion because it really is for good luck! The best thing about it for a child is that the charm is NOT removable!!!"
3.0,Baby doll size
3.0,some of the socks were made in such a way that they didn't fit my feet:(  There wasn't enough stretch.
3.0,"The wallet is great. The money clip is not. I lost seventy bucks because some of the cash slipped from my wallet clip. The card slots stay formed well as long as you dont over clip them and I found that the secret pocket is actually pretty useful.<br />ID slot: three ID's<br />Secret pocket: 3 cards<br />front pocket: three cards<br />other pockets: one card, max two<br /><br />Dislike the money clip... but I use a rubber band now. Ghetto, but cool"
3.0,did not expect the slip underneath to be short...<br />the slip is too short or maybe Im too tall 6 ft tall<br />I love the colors and the way it fits up top and the skirt(sheer) was long enough<br />the slip was just too short...<br />pretty dress
3.0,"Hoops are very small, hard to get in. Studs are small but cute."
3.0,"Belt is fine but cutting it to size is very hard, do not oversize."
3.0,"What i expected for the price, not too bad!!"
3.0,somewhat larger then I wanted so i dont get all the benefits from wearing them.
3.0,The top part of the shoe comes up too high & makes them painful to walk in.
3.0,Very very thin material! Cute shirt but very thin.
3.0,"Had a little more 'yellow' tone to it than what I wanted, otherwise looks like a great tie. I returned it for a different color."
3.0,Great but after a couple weeks wear silver backing started to wear down to copper.
3.0,Pouches not correctly scaled to fit regular or average duty gear for officers. Stitching poor quality.
3.0,I really love this dress! The color and fit are awesome. It's the polyester fabric that disappointed. I wanted cool cotton for hot summer days.
3.0,Dress has pockets- runs very big- extra fabric-  dress good for coverup or running to store
3.0,Cute earrings  but not well made...
3.0,they are not the same one tassel is much  Fuller than the other and more shiny material 😒
3.0,It is a small gown compared to others that are so long. It is a gift and the new baby girl isn't here yet. Hope it fits. It doesn't have much give to it. Pretty material and thicker then others. I gave it a 3 stars and will review after the new year when the twins are here a girl and boy!
3.0,"My husband was really disappointed in this watch. It looks nice, but other than that, it wasn't impressive. It won't sync properly with his phone to get the right time. It's always behind 10-15 minutes. You can control your music with it and it has a pedometer, but it's pretty limited in what it will do. It's not as useful as my husband had hoped. For a basic watch, though, it does look high quality and it's comfortable for him. It is on the big side, but nothing too drastic."
3.0,todo bienestar
3.0,"The color was beautiful, and we took perfect measurements before ordering, but the dress was way too big once it got here. I really liked the fabric and the way the dress fell… However, some might think it’s a little long. (Daughter is 5’2”) we were turned and ordered a size down (small) in the blue because they didn’t have any red for prime shipping. A little disappointed, but the blue is pretty too :-)"
3.0,Product is oversized. The middle loop makes no sense.
3.0,"dress nice flattering comfy.<br />color: kinda dirty yellow<br />delivery package: open package, seems someone tried them on and fold it just to fit the bag. messy. was not presented well<br />i fee like i was a trash so dress is like a trash.<br />just the packaging is awful!"
3.0,"just ok, kind of cheap looking"
3.0,"It’s extremely stretchy and stretched out over one night of wearing, making the waist not very flattering. Very hot material as well."
3.0,This bracelet is longer than 7.5 inches. That makes it to run loose instead of fitting properly your wrist. Anyway. I did like it.
3.0,"The shorts are a tiny bit snug and the top is WAY too big. It's a cute set and I love the style, but the sizing is bizarre."
3.0,really tight on legs
3.0,"The fit of the shirt is fine,  the style is cute, however its 100% NOT fleece as it says in the description. The tag say its Polyester & Cotton. I was expecting a fleece sweatshirt, this is just a hooded shirt."
3.0,They are perfect fit right out of dryer but stretches out and quicky become baggy thx
3.0,Just so so!
3.0,"NOT NOT NOT Nickle free!  Bought this for my husband, and he is allergic to nickel. He now has a large allergic reaction on his stomach from the buckle.<br /><br /> 4/27/18  Changed from 1 to 3 stars: Since this initial review, the company has contacted me and sent us a new nickle free tested buckle and belt and my husband has seen massive improvement.  Very happy that they company made right by us.  Not sure if their typical stock is nickle free.  I would double check with them before buying if you have a nickle allergy."
3.0,Not impressed with this piece of jewelry.  The crystal looked dead.  The chain was cheap looking too.
3.0,"These are huge. I’m a 41 year old woman and they literally fell off my face. Neither of my teenage daughters can wear them either, but they’re perfect for my boyfriend. Definitely not one size fits all."
3.0,I ordered these in size large (I’m a US medium) as I had for other Chinese products of similar style and the were too large so they went back.  I did not reorder as the fabric and fit just weren’t all that great.  I suppose for for $10 they would be fine
3.0,"wouldn't order again, just not the quality I thought they appeared to be"
3.0,It is a nice product and its price is a good choice
3.0,It was a nice slip but it was to short for what I needed it for.
3.0,Looks better in the advertisement. Color is fade material is cheap.
3.0,Cute and comfortable but to big... I'm normally a large or extra large and the large i ordered is really baggy.
3.0,I got this product thinking I was going to get the butterfly necklace instead I got a different one. I got a double heart necklace one had rhinestones on it and the other one was plan silver. I was disappointed I didn't get the butterfly necklace I was going to give it to my daughter for a present. She did like the other necklace though. I wish they would have sent me a message saying they were out of this necklace and was replacing it something else. The heart necklace I received instead was pretty it was all silver.
3.0,"Somehow I expected more from a pair of socks that costs $49.99. Yeah, I know there is a higher list price that is crossed off. But the actual pair of socks that arrived is in a TommieCopper package with a price sticker on it that says $29.50. They might have wanted to peel that off. Oh, and hand wash hang to dry only."
3.0,Nice sweater but was supposed to be a men's large and fit more like a medium. No tag inside
3.0,The heart became detached fairly quickly even though she was extremely careful with it. Kind of disappointed. The heart came off within 2 months of me giving it to her.
3.0,"The red wasn't as it appeared online.  The shoes were very cute though, but I returned them because it wasn't red I expected - like it was a little more orangey red than blood red if that makes sense."
3.0,"As per headline, the product is as advertised, however it took two tries, with the second try almost 5 months to arrive to my mailbox in ZA."
3.0,"I ordered a yellow watch of the same brand and style, and I love it. So I chose to get the black one. It arrived safely with no damage, however, the battery was dead."
3.0,"While I received it sooner than I expected to, it arrived bent. I bought this as a gift, and now I cannot give it, as I am afraid to unbend the post for fear of it breaking off."
3.0,"Runs VERY small!  I usually wear a medium, so based on other reviews, I ordered a large.  Still too small, arms are very narrow and tight.  Going back.  Otherwise it is cute.  Light thin material and pretty soft."
3.0,"My first reaction was LOVE. When I put it on it was smaller than I expected but it was okay, I sort of expected that. It’s cozy and cute and I love the material of the outside and the liner. Then I checked out the pockets. So disappointing. There are only three pockets. Two for your hands and a square pocket on the inside left chest. All of the liners are made of very cheap material that will not wear well and all three pockets are extremely shallow. None of them will securely hold my phone. It’s very annoying. I’ll probably try to fix the pockets myself and keep the jacket but I can say I wouldn’t have ordered this if I had known the pockets sucked so bad."
3.0,"Very beautiful but the center gems are larger than expected. Because of this, I can't push the bar far enough to one side in order to get the other side in... I really wish that it unscrewed at the center piece instead, because I am unable to wear it because of this.."
3.0,"I love the light, t-shirt like material of this dress but it fits me more like a shirt. I wear it with leggings or regular jeans. It's much shorter than depicted."
3.0,"Slippery bottoms, not for indoor use. Like a felt bottom."
3.0,Fits perfect but is a little see through.
3.0,"I really didn’t like the material of the dress at first but when I wore it, it felt good!"
3.0,"Very cute top, but the length was not long enough. It seemed more like a petite fit."
3.0,Ok hat. Not deep enough for head.
3.0,Shirts run small.  Buy the larger size.
3.0,"Somewhat small in fit, and much thinner than I expected, but overall a decent sweater to ward off the chill when it's not too cold."
3.0,I think the design is very cool but if your not skinny do not buy. I bought xxxl and thats actually only a xl I think in American size.
3.0,"I liked the skirt but didn't know that it was see thru. The lines are sheer in between. It's fits but it's too tight for me. I have a belly. And I'm also wondering if it is made for plus sizes. The 3 star rating is strictly for having sheer lines. No lining. If being see thru doesn't bother you, then it's perfect for you."
3.0,"The dress is nice, but the size is not good."
3.0,"The picture looks much better than the dress I received.  It's that same old cheep, stretchy material and the colors already look less vivid than in the picture."
3.0,The lights are amazing but the size is definitely for a child.
3.0,"The watch was nothing special.  The Indigo light was extremely dull, possibly a battery issue.  Easy to set hours and date"
3.0,It says north south east west it already has the coordinates wrong and the chain is very short so buy separate chain also you can take out the middle piece because it is confusing
3.0,My son did not care for these shirts.  They appear cheap and not well made.
3.0,"My husband is a holistic physician and he likes to wear ties in the clinic during the holidays. I got these since they were a nice variety of designs, which he could rotate wearing.  I'm not complaining, as they were fun for him to wear, but they are not really for a full size man.  It says Men Boys, but they are really more Boys than Men lol. Still I'm keeping them...but future buyers should be aware that they are not high quality and run small."
3.0,They’re cute as could be but the soles are cardboard making them almost disposable
3.0,"Ordered hoping these were heavier sweat pants but they are thin, more like work out pants."
3.0,These were a bit stiff to put on. My younger one needs help every time.
3.0,"I usually wear a medium but have been stuck before so I ordered the large, it is snug but if I shed a few pounds it should fit better. the shorts itself is well made and looks great."
3.0,"So a few things. The packaging was all over the place. I ordered the Wanda outfit for my wife and from the photos it looked like the headdress was made of solid plastic. Nope, a low quality fabric.  Everything was stuffed in a single plastic bag with the zipper broken. The headdress was bent and flimsy. The pink stockings were a bit too see through. We ordered a small and it was still a bit too small for her. (she’s about 5’5). I ordered the Vision costume for myself and it was ok. To help anyone out I ordered a medium and I’m about 5’9 and pretty slim. It fit pretty well. My only real complaint was there were stains of oil or like someone drew on the cape."
3.0,"Came partially broken, but it was easy to fix. Good quality, though. Love it"
3.0,too plastic
3.0,"Ordered 2 of these. Small and medium. I received 2 mediums. Great shirt quality. Def heat press so it will last in the wash. Beware the shirt has a very bad odor upon arrival. Like, bad as in will smell up an entire room. Wash immediately."
3.0,"They fit nicely, but they do not pass the squat test. Completely see through."
3.0,"Didn't care for color at all, very loud and garish."
3.0,Chain doesn't lay right on the neck line and geta all tangled.
3.0,To short to double and to long left single.
3.0,"VERY PRETTY ,FLATTERING DRESS"
3.0,Fit was fine but material was much more rough than previous editions of this brand’s workout tank tops.
3.0,ver y nice. but look cheap
3.0,"Well made, comfortable,  But tight in the hips"
3.0,A lot narrower than I thought it would be.
3.0,"The dress material is quite thin, which can be nice for hot weather. Based on the price, it was pretty much what I expected, however, the dress runs big. I would have needed one size smaller than normal. Also,  it gives no shape at the waist."
3.0,returned it. Too small.
3.0,The chain is a little flimsy.
3.0,Somewhat large even when the size is small.
3.0,Looks beige off white
3.0,"The dress is very sheer. It's a strange stretchy material that's partially see through. It's very large in the body and then the skirt is much more narrow. Not necessarily off the shoulder, more of a boat neck. I'm using it as a swimsuit cover up."
3.0,"Beautiful, chic, but  . . . it is a nuisance to have to hem it.  Also arrived wrinkled, so will have to be ironed even if you like the length."
3.0,Too small for a 7 year old
3.0,"I like the dress and I'm normally a pretty predictable size 10, or medium, but this is snug around the waist, though manageable.  But the zipper is of poor quality making it even harder to zip up over my waist.  But for the price - it's a decent dress."
3.0,As with other reviews this is not as sheer as pictured. Its still a cute cover up so I will keep it.. It does have slits on the side.
3.0,"it has a lot of pockets and good distribution, but it is not to comfortable to use."
3.0,"Runs a bit small, color is very dull not like the picture, looks muddy"
3.0,"If your kid go to school in ny,  do not buy the small one."
3.0,this was too small and so beautiful I was disappointed!
3.0,These fit alittle tighter than I wanted. Even though it says its 100% cotton I was expecting them to stretch alittle better.
3.0,The material is so thin you can see through it. It will be fine with a tank.
3.0,Out of the 4 one of them broke the 2nd day i wore it magnets are  kind of weak .
3.0,Strap wasn’t quite long enough to wear as crossbody. I sm plus size. But I Do like it.
3.0,"Good band , it has to be broken in"
3.0,"Nice for HOT weather, but very sheer. Home wear -  not going out wear."
3.0,"Short-ish in the torso. Cheaply made, but sort of what I expected at this price point. I’ll keep it because it will be an easy go-to for the summer."
3.0,"very rough material, medium was too wide"
3.0,"Great look and fit, has a terrible smell. I have been airing it out and have washed it and it is finally wearable"
3.0,"Nicely made, but really narrow.  Would not lie flat."
3.0,"fits as expected, have to hand wash to minimize fading the print"
3.0,"This bra is nicely made, and comes with removable paddings. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit me at all...I'm size 32DD, half of my boobs(side boobs) show. For those ladies with heavier bust, this bra will not fit you like the way it should even if you have a small ribcage like me. Oh well, I gave it to my sister who wears size 34A and she's very happy with it."
3.0,"I like my earrings but they are smaller than they appear on the model. I also had a sore ear after wearing them,so if you are sensitive to certain metals, this my bug you a bit. They are really pretty and they do stand out, I also got the matching necklace and bracelet. I got compliments on the very first time I wore them out!"
3.0,Bigger than I expected so it look cheap. But it is still cute.
3.0,Its a beautiful ring but kinda of thin.  I expected it to be thicker then it is.  But it is practical to use.
3.0,Looks nice...however does not stay on after multiple use.Falls off especially if you are sweating.
3.0,It's a cute shirt but the gray part is kind of big and the plus part on the arms is really tight
3.0,it's not as the picture describes the ball on top and the stem on the bottom are not amethyst stone they are clear plastic so it's not the look I wanted
3.0,"Too big. Probably wont fit until he is 4. So we can’t use em now,  but we’ll keep em."
3.0,great looking suit just way to big for my daughter.  I ordered it to the sizing chart that was including in ordering and she is unable to wear it.  she was not happy. * please be careful of the sizing when ordering.*Disclaimer- I purchased this product at a discounted rate or for free for my honest review.
3.0,"The mask it’s self is great easy to breathe, doesn’t fog my glasses and light weight. However the filters do not fit, when I tried to slide the filters into the pouch they wouldn’t go past the middle. Due to the stitching for the nose it won’t go further then the middle of the mask."
3.0,I was using it as a mail opener it last about two months before it broke.
3.0,just do not fit and were not as tall as i anticipated
3.0,Product was half defective. Otherwise it would be nice.
3.0,"Very durable.. Except for the pin holding the spring. That will fall off within a matter of days to weeks. However, I've been using this without it for the past two years and the rest of it holds together very well! If you want it to keep its spring, you shouldn't get it though."
3.0,"These tops are MUCH thinner than I expected! They are just a thin piece of undershirt material with edges that are unfinished.  I am 5' 7&quot;, 34A.  I ordered a size large (I usually order medium sizes but the size chart showed for me to order a large) and it fits pretty good, but a little large. I would like it a little smaller but I'd rather it be big than small.  It hangs down and flows nicely.  The picture makes this tank top look thinker.  I will have to wear another tank top or think sports bra underneath."
3.0,"Really cute shoe, but a bit too narrow and not enough support for my flat feet"
3.0,I&#34;m sure she enjoyed it. I was a gift from me<br />I don't have anything more to say.<br />  Thank you
3.0,"I ordered a small size but apparently for us petite gals we have to get an XS instead. Material was great, looked just like in the picture. I was worried about the wrap not working out but it was fine, the rope ish thingy that ties held fast, I tied a knot twice. The dress turned out to be longer than my 156cm self so I had to wear heels."
3.0,The advertisement made me believe that I was getting 16 different toe rings when in fact I got 2 of each making it 8 different styles. The wide bands hurt my toes and I’m not sure why. I’ve been wearing them forever!
3.0,Very loose and way to long
3.0,"much longer then it appears, the fabric is like spandex"
3.0,These Capri's were too small.  I have several bandolino capri's but these did not fit
3.0,"These jeans are sized appropriately for American sizes.  I wear a size 12 in jeans, but I ordered a size 14 thinking the Allegra K brand was an Asian brand.  The 14s were a full size or two too large, so I returned them.  The material was a bit too thin to be true &#34;jeans&#34;.  These are more of a &#34;legging&#34; material.  The back pockets were a bit too small and looked a little funny.  I'm going to pay ten more dollars and buy another pair of Eunina Jeans Women's High Waisted Stretch Skinny Denim which are as near a perfect jean as a woman can want."
3.0,This is not made for tall people. The pant leg size is way too small.
3.0,"It is what it is, extra large is a little tight maybe the ones I got were not extra large and just extra large I mean just large I’ll try again my fault thank you"
3.0,Cute but the inserts kept coming out
3.0,The sleeves were uncomfortably small
3.0,The fabric was not what I expected it was a beautiful style gown and it's cut a size too small however I do have scratch electricity.
3.0,have to order larger size next time but great product .
3.0,"My primary complaint with this item is the color. I ordered the white, and it is more of a cream color than white. Typically I'm not this nitpicky, but I was needing specifically a white cardigan. Interesting fit, there's no defined top or bottom, but fabric folded in half with sleeves. Not sure yet if I'll be sending it back."
3.0,"Really really cute navel ring, but the bottom two dangling gems broke off after a week. I still wear the top most gem but its not the same. Disappointed."
3.0,"When this arrived, I opened the package and noticed the material. I thought I was sent the wrong item, it's super shiny! However, no fear, after washing the shine goes away. As you can tell from my pictures this dress is really stretchy. I usually wear a size 22 and got the XXL in this dress. It's pretty short not to wear with anything under, but not so short that I haven't work without something under. The sleeves of the dress are definitely loose like in the picture. Also, this will only look like the picture if you have NO chest. I have plenty of chest, so this is fitted more around the upper area and tummy. I do like that it's a light material because I get warm easy. I have noticed that after machine washing twice it's gotten really soft. Some of the seams look a little sketchy, but so far they've held up. I wouldn't buy this again, but I don't regret the purchase."
3.0,"Good for one time use. I used as part of a costume, but thread was coming out in parts of it by the end of the night."
3.0,"It makes your chests really far apart, which isn't my style, but my sister tried it on, and she likes it-she is a few inches shorter and weighs a little less, so maybe it was just too small for me. I would order a size up, to make sure it fits you."
3.0,"I bought this bar after I purchased another one at a store. The 1st one I bought in the store had a spring clasp that wasn't strong enough to keep the bar straight across. This clip was stronger but still slipped quite a bit. But for the price, it did a decent job.<br /><br />Also, this isn't completely the product's fault as I was the one putting it on, but the ends are squared (and kinda sharp) and actually damaged my tie when I was putting it on. So just be careful putting it on."
3.0,It was very tight below the boobs and at the arms
3.0,Wish they came up to my waist.
3.0,This is a super cute outfit but I'll have to keep it a year for baby to wear!
3.0,Purchased for my daughter and it faded and broke in a week. Arrived prior to the delivery date. Thanks
3.0,The strap has a loop on it that fell off and the colored thread is coming off.
3.0,"Looks nothing like the picture. ..it'll still work for the dress  I bought it for, but it's not at all what i expected other than its black"
3.0,"Good low cost sock tie. The bottom of the tie, with the sock opening, is sewed shut. However, after several ties the thread has come undone and I have to keep stuffing it back inside after tying it around my neck."
3.0,After wearing this for a week i had to stop.  The rubber part that attaches to the glasses touches my ears and changes the angle on the nose piece of my frames.  Makes nose piece dig in even when loose.  Unbearable when wearing headphones.  Really wanted it to work but the glasses i wear bearly hook on my ears.  If the ends of ur glasses stick out past your ears then this will not affect you and i would give it 5 stars.
3.0,"I wash items before I use them. The sweater seemed great. Right size, the length was what I wanted... after washing and drying it, it became a clingy mess! Returned it."
3.0,I originally ordered this glove in black and it was so great I ordered a second pair each for about $30. Then I ordered the tan (skin tone) in small (another $29) and it was two times bigger and in turn useless as a fingerless compression glove. Too bad.  I would NOT recommend as their sizing is NOT consistent or reliable.
3.0,A little stiff
3.0,"not so warm, wear socks with them."
3.0,"Looks great when new, but it scuffs so easily.  I wear a beeper for work (yes, I know it's 2022) and a badge. Both i clip on my belt, and they have scratched this belt all over. Haven't had this problem with any other belt. It's a shame because it's a beautiful belt."
3.0,Cute but sizing is incorrect or inconsistent. Runs small. Otherwise good quality.
3.0,"I think this watch is a little big bigger than I thought.  I could not find any manual for the watch therefore I had to figure it out myself.  It is definitely a multiplication watch but with a manual it is difficult to operate, the alarm system had pretty quiet sound might as well use the cell phone.  The dualtime zone is very nice I can set it up for different time when I travel."
3.0,"Fit was good, I liked the idea of no underwire. There is however a plastic flat ribbing along the side of the breast area of the bra.  When I sat or slouched or curled up my spine in any way, it stabbed me in the ribs. Very uncomfortable.  I went in a removed it with a stitch ripper and now it fits fine so far and doesn't stab me anymore.  I will update based on next time i wear it, if I feel otherwise."
3.0,"The quality seems to be good, but they are so small that my wife can't wear them, and she is not a large woman."
3.0,Runs big and has poor quality.
3.0,Pretty enough but too short for a twice around wrap and much too long with a single wrap.
3.0,I followed the measurement chart and ordered our exact size. They were HUGE. Had to go two sizes down to fit.
3.0,"Too see through for me, and short in the body!"
3.0,"The smallest size is way too large and boxy on a slender woman (5'3"", 103lbs). Colors and style are cute, but had to return due to size."
3.0,I've bought this same hoodie in black previously and I loved it so much. I bought it this time in the grey and the material was different and it fit smaller even though I ordered the large (Same as I did with the black) So I was very disappointed with this purchase. But my sister liked it so I gave it to her.
3.0,"I didn’t like the fabric, but the fit and design were good."
3.0,Hard to see features.  Picture looks nicer.
3.0,I bought it for my wife. She usually wears her hair up in a bun ponytail. She had to let her hair down before the hat would fit. Otherwise it fit as expected and covered her ears.
3.0,I was disappointed that it did NOT have any tags on it.  This was for a gift and for all they know it is something I picked up at Goodwill.
3.0,The dress looks just like the photo. It is actually well built. But the fabric is not thick enough to make this a nice party dress.
3.0,"Except, 3 broken clasps, and can't seem to get the kinks out of the satin cords.  Some are a lot worse than others.  Other than that, I love them!"
3.0,Not the best quality.  Very thin!
3.0,It’s a nice dress. I just have a small waist and was hoping it would be a little more fitted.
3.0,They’re good for a few weeks-a month . Then they break or the ball falls off. The dangle part broke too
3.0,Material was too thick and it ripped so easily
3.0,"The snaps are not secure in the material like they should and pulls off to easy,  nice fit and comfortable"
3.0,"I like the look in the pictures of these boxer/briefs but I don't like the fit. To me they fit more like boxers than briefs and they seemed sized way too big. There is zero support for what I'm used to in this type of underwear. The blend of material is 70% Polyester to 30% Cotton which just doesn't feel as soft as a higher Cotton blend. But if you like more of a large fitting boxer type underwear, you may love these. It's all subjective right?"
3.0,The length is pretty short and it's wider than expected.. But with a little altering it's quite cute.
3.0,"My wife loved it. But, after about 2 weeks of solid wear, the black paint is starting to come off of the lettering."
3.0,Has an odd smell and its tight for a 22&#34; head
3.0,Its exactly as advertised.
3.0,They work ok but mine have alrrady broken several times andni had to restitch them.
3.0,"These mitten holders are a bit longer than I would have preferred, but I was unhappy when I saw the back of one of the metal clips on the floor.  It seems to have just fallen off."
3.0,Works well holding keys together
3.0,"It fits and adjusts fantastic, but its tricky trying to unbuckle it so I don't make it too tight so I can twist it.<br />Practice it a few times before you wear it."
3.0,This fleece is fuzzy on the outside and has smooth arms inside like in a ski jacket. I think the burbur type on the outside is not a hoody type for work and will attract more dust and dirt than the smooth type of hoody that most people are used to.
3.0,Gosh I loved this dress but it seemed uneven so I returned it .
3.0,The fit of this shirt was not as I expected.
3.0,I am a size 16 and this didn't fit nowhere near as long as pic and wasn't as slouchy or relaxed fitting as pictured.  It's very cute and nice material but I will have to pass on wearing this as a cover-up...a casual shirt should be more of it's description.  I will be giving this too my daughter.
3.0,"This shirt is really cute, decent quality. My only complaint is that it runs a little small. I normally wear a large in tops so that is what I ordered. It’s a little more snug than I like and wish I would have ordered one size up. But other than that, it’s really cute!!"
3.0,I like the hat but found it a bit tight.
3.0,The largest size couldn't fit on the feet. Extra large with extra wide width would be nice.
3.0,"I thought it would be right, but while t's short, it's too wide and loose at the bottom. Looks weird on large breast. I'm 5'7&#34;, 130 lbs., and a small DDD. Giving it away."
3.0,"The colour and design is great, however, it was a little too big especially the top section. I weigh 100 lbs, height 5ft 3 in and with my body frame and small bust it didn't fit as how I wanted it to. The bottom piece, I found was a bit loose at the waist and leg section so I had to hand sew it at the waist for it to fit. By the way I purchased a small and I would recommend that persons with my body type don't purchase this swimsuit unless x-small is available."
3.0,So the shirt was really cute and it fit just fine. BUT I wore the thing only one time because by the end of the day when I wore it the flared sleeve had ripped from the shirt on both sides. I ended up having to throw it away. Super disappointed because I really liked it.
3.0,Not the same weight as the originals.
3.0,The fit just wasn’t quite right. I have an hour glass shape but I think it was meant for someone with no curves. Won’t be wearing in public.
3.0,I love the natural brown color and the quality.  I just should have ordered a size up for the majority of my gems and minerals.
3.0,I received this nice looking watch.  As a matter of fact I bought 2 and neither work. Contacted seller they were very responsive.  Hope the next steps fix these great watches.
3.0,The material for this product was poor. The colors were not as vivid as the photo but it did fit as expected. Ended up using this as a swimsuit cover up not a dress. It wasn’t a total waste but not what I wanted to use it for.
3.0,Decent knockoffs
3.0,The material is too thin super clear to wear out
3.0,"When I exhale, my breath shoots out to my ears!  Was looking for cotton breathability.  Nice comfort around ears."
3.0,"I like the fit, it was flattering but it was slightly on the loose side around the bust. Since it has a snap it wasn't an issue around the bust as it looks somewhat conservative then, which I didn't mind. The overall fit was good. I am 150lbs and 5'5"" ordered a Medium, blue. I really did like the dress style. The fabric was very light however not see-through. My one dislike, which was enough to return the dress was the pattern. It was very overwhelming dots all over. The Blue was a nice blue and I believe the dress would like better as a solid color than the dotted pattern. It was overwhelming and looking at it in the sunlight made me slightly dizzy."
3.0,"This is pretty but very fake looking to me.  It's difficult to make round, solitaire rings look real.  The setting the large stone is in is basic and the stone isn't sitting in it quite right.  The ring wrap is very pretty, it's the best of the set.  You can put a different ring inside and make it work.  Overall quality is basic, and I know for the price there are better options out there.  It is real sterling silver at least and won't fade or tarnish.  Sizing seems to be correct.  The set comes in a nice gift box.  For me, this just doesn't do it and I would not recommend this set."
3.0,"Nice pieces but as you can see the long chains<br />won’t hook to a pair of crocs without purchasing rings separately. (Rings are not included.) The short chains seem ok, you plug those in. Every chain is made from acrylic."
3.0,Its decent enough to wear. the magnet slides little by little as the day goes so I always have to adjust
3.0,Like the look.  Supper thin material.  Feels like the letters are holding together the jacket.  Good fit
3.0,Very pretty but not very durable
3.0,"They smell like they were in a factory fire. Only one other review remarked on the smell, but mine were really strong. I'm going to try to let them air out in the sun for a while to see if it gets better.<br />Otherwise, size is ok - not huge but I think they will be able to take my largest sunglasses. Not sure if they would take those huge bug eye women's sunglasses (maybe - not sure)."
3.0,"I'm giving this wonderful coat only three stars because of the overly large fit, which the company doesn't warn you about. I normally wear a medium in everything and when this coat arrived it was far to large and of course, it doesn't come in a small!  It is heavyweight, warm and seems to be very well made and I will only hope in the future I can find it in small. I have started the process to return. (Unfortunately)"
3.0,"See photo. These are all larges. The green fits true to size, purple and blue fit like mediums. You can see there is an extreme variation in size among colors. If ordering green or purple, go a size up."
3.0,"Pretty, but the stones fall out easily."
3.0,"I love these earrings. They look very pretty on and the stones glisten like their more expensive counterparts. However…they are very heavy!  I have not decided whether or not I will return them because of this, but I can see these being quite annoying because of their weight."
3.0,Very cute.  Not super expensive looking but perfect for dressing up on the go.
3.0,"it's cute, but doesn't fit how it looks in the picture.  the sides aren't long enough to make the criss cross visible, it just looks like a little gap under the bra part and then a strap where both criss cross but aren't far enough away to see space between them.  I may post a picture if needed"
3.0,"I love this bag.  I was so disappointed to see that since purchasing it 8 months ago, the stitching holding the strap to the purse was half undone.  Surprising for a Kate Spade."
3.0,"Too large so I had to return it.  Fun shape, a bit cheap in the material."
3.0,"I like it but it gives me a bad skin reaction whenever I wear it. Whatever the hearts are made of irritates my skin to where I have very red, itchy, little bumps all over my chest for up to a whole week and left behind a few tiny scars which thankfully are fading away now. I love the chokers but please but careful if you have sensitive skin wearing this."
3.0,"It is a lovely chain, but not what I was looking for.  The magnification makes the spaces between the links look larger than they are and I picked something that didn't work for me as a result, but it is still a lovely necklace."
3.0,They are very tight. I wouldn't say I have huge wrists and I'm a woman so if a guy were to buy these they would VERY tight on him. I kinda knew I would need to break them in bc there is no way to adjust them. I just didn't expect them to be this tight
3.0,"I love the dress, and the color. I am currently nursing, and I was looking for a nursing friendly dress that wasn’t too revealing. To snap the dress across the chest is nearly impossible for me. I ordered a large. I am about a 36G when I am nursing.  I will save it for when I’m no longer nursing, but it just didn’t fit the need I was hoping it would."
3.0,Do buy in mens sandal 1 and 1/2 sizes bigger.
3.0,"I bought 2 of these (one in pink and one in green). My pink one arrived first and I was sooo disappointed. the material was horribly see through and just made material in general. i was like ugh i have another one coming in the mail that sucks. but like the green one arrived and it was nothing like the pink one… the material was actually pretty nice! i was so confused and shocked that i hated the pink but loved the green… i went to compare them and they had COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TAGS. so weird. so just letting you know, you may get one thats good quality or one that is bad 😬"
3.0,I thought the beads would be bigger .. I bought these for a senior in a nursing home so he could go to mass whenever he liked.  He has neuropathy in his hands.
3.0,Bought it for my husband for kayaking.
3.0,"Buy a size down for loose fit, 2 size down for fitted fit."
3.0,"I am 25 weeks pregnant. I ordered a size large. Pre pregnancy I wore a small or a medium (5'4 125 lbs). I felt like the reviews on this were misleading... many people suggested it ran small so since I've gained a little more than some so far this pregnancy I decided to error in the side of caution and order a large. I am literally swimming in it. It's an ill-fitting, super unflattering dress.  Just awful. Super disappointing because it is cute if it fit me right. Just for reference I am 5'4 and weigh about 150 with a decent size baby bump for 25 weeks."
3.0,I really liked this product but from day 1 had problems putting the item on my Gear S2.  I like to change the bank every so often but this last time when I pushed in the button the bank came off but the attachment was still attached to my S2.  It was very difficult to remove this piece.
3.0,So the front cross hangs weirdly every once in a while the underneath fabric catches the bit that is on top and then hangs weirdly. Overall it’s not horrible
3.0,A bit snug for an XL.  its cute and soft.  I wish it would have fit better.
3.0,I bought this purse to put my phone and keys in when I take a walk.  I have a Galaxy Note and it fits perfectly with enough room to put my house keys in.  I did add a chain to the handle to make it an actual cross body purse. The only con about this purse is the chemical smell that hits you as soon as you open the package.  I set it outside to air out which helped  little.
3.0,Happy for the most part. Sand still seems to find its way in but I guess that is sands job.
3.0,"Keep in mind that everything but the bottom is lace. This does peak through with many shoes so you really have to adjust it to make it &#34;ultra low-cut&#34; and disappear. Otherwise, they are comfortable and have a lot of texture so they don't slip around too much."
3.0,Nice design buy crappy fabric. The fabric was paper think.
3.0,Runs small.  I got a xxl and it fit like a Medium.  The color is three shades lighter.  Not the color I expected.
3.0,The stone was chipped and the necklace sent with it was broken.
3.0,"the shirt is well liked. the material is rather thin, other than that it's a nice shirt"
3.0,The pattern is very cute but the fabric is super light and fits snug. I'd order a size up.
3.0,Need photo resizing info website
3.0,"Pretty dress however it reminds me of a night gown. I decided to wear it with a kimono to change it looking like a nightgown. I have 2 colors, brown (more mauve) and white. Be forewarned the white is see thru (as stated)"
3.0,"I will keep this skort but it's not my favorite. The seem across the back below the waist  inches up and does not lay flat..<br />The material is thin but will probably dry very fast. Shorts are a mesh. Not flattering to my figure. I think it makes me look heavier. I guess with the right tunic top it will be ok. I am 5'4, about 170 and carry a lot of my weight in waist, hips, and thighs.<br />You can get quite a few others on line that are more flattering. The color is nice."
3.0,"This tunic needs something to prep it up, and I will need to alter the bottom since it feels tight.  Getting clothes online is always a crapshot because there is no uniform standard for sizes, and the fit differs a great deal from manufacturer to manufacturer.  This tunic is way too tight around the hips and needs a facelift overall as it looks rather plain and boring."
3.0,The package was very damaged & had holes. 5 springs are missing. This was a gift & cannot be completed until we get the springs.  Expensive items should not be thrown around
3.0,Soaks stop the rain stays wet for a very long time
3.0,"Not soft cotton like the bras are, thes are like regular factory Hanes cotton underwear."
3.0,Beautiful! Looks so good on! Perfect for the price!! Love it!!<br />Update: after 2 months of continuous wear the center &#34;stone&#34; fell out. This ring is out of stock and cannot be replaced. Sad!
3.0,Cheap looking & no pockets.
3.0,This dress is very pretty but it’s short. Like very short. I’m about 5’6” 200ish lbs and it fits but it falls like a shirt. About mid thigh.
3.0,Both balls magically unscrewed themselves (after being very securely tightened) & for that reason they are now lost. Replaced with others I had lying around & theyre much more secure.
3.0,I loved this Fitbit band. However it fell off my wrist and I lost my brand new  fitbit in less than a week.
3.0,"Really wrinkled, so if you don't like to iron that would be a problem. Comfortable though and fits well."
3.0,"It is a little big and while it has a nice flow, it does have the look of a low-cost garment.  It's is okay and I will wear it."
3.0,"The bust is small, had to give to my niece."
3.0,"It fits well and comfortable, but the material is a bit thin and a bit transparent.  I need to wear a sweater or robe if Im walking around the house with others home, since it is a bit see thru.  But comfy to sleep with otherwise."
3.0,"These run tragically small. The material looks different than in the photos. There's a sheen to it that looks cheap. Not really any stretch so if you truly want these to work out in, it's not really comfortable for that. There wasn't much to the ""stack"". Needs to be longer."
3.0,"Unfortunately the white are completely see-through and arrive with a weird brown stain on them. The fit, fabric and style is basically that of Lularoe leggings (suede-like material). I'm a pant size 10-12, 6 ft tall, athletic build and these are slightly snug and hit above the ankle. Still comfortable, wearable and good value for the price. I don't like this material for fitness, it gets too hot, but great for casual wear, etc."
3.0,Cool looking and decent quality but NOT leather. Main complaint is that it is nearly impossible to tie and untie because it grips itself.
3.0,iys okay good deal the pic is better
3.0,Much smaller than expected. My child could not wear this as a dress. Much too short. Paired it with leggings. Stains come out easily but sadly fabric developed holes quite easily.
3.0,A little too big for my wrist for the mood part to work.
3.0,Tried medium and small not working for me.
3.0,"5'4 normally wears an XL.  We ordered an XL. It was tight. If she was any taller it would have been too short.  It is a $35 polyester dress with next-day shipping.  It's adequate with those caveats. We ordered this for a mock wedding photo shoot. It was a little tight for the ""bride"" even with spanx. It's absolutely a case of Chinse sizing. Order a size larger. The fabric is thick but you can see everything through it. It's not forgiving. It was tough to steam out the creases. I was afraid to use an actual iron with it. Concerned that it would melt. Our Model is a beautiful girl and she generously rolled with the punches. We had her hold the bouquet over her belly and none was the wiser. We haven't seen the photos yet. But she looked fine in the dress so I expect that the photos will look nice. Unless you're short, twiggy thin, and not using this for a special occasion, I wouldn't recommend this dress."
3.0,Bigger then I expected but oh well
3.0,Looks amazing but the material is VERY thin! My daughter tripped and it ripped.
3.0,The shirt fits as expected but the neck seems stretched out. Not flattering at all!
3.0,"Love everything about these, this is the 2nd dress I've ordered only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is this one came with a hole in the pocket."
3.0,getting holes fast.
3.0,Cute pj’s except the top lining is awkward
3.0,Nice shirt. Arm openings just right. BUT I wanted a cotton shirt and this is 95% rayon and 5% Spandex. Description is incorrect.
3.0,"These pants are cute but they’re cut a little weird. The waist is super loose but the rest of the pant fit my body. Legs are slim, hips are snug, and length is great. They aren’t going to fall off due to the hips being snug but the waist part is super baggy. Might return soon but love the pattern and the pockets."
3.0,I ordered a size smaller and it was still too big. The high waist and long inseam make it look like a mom jean . It was also too roomy in the thigh area and I didn't  like the hem. It wasn't finished. The embroidery was beautiful.  Nice weight. Super fast delivery!
3.0,Decent quality for price. Wanted the bottom to go over belly button but doesn’t. Thin material.
3.0,"I purchased a few of these for rotator cuff surgery.  Overall was good product.  But when washed,  material pilled pretty bad, looked like had been worn several times"
3.0,a little large but it wraps around the eyes somewhat and filters the sun.
3.0,Strap is too long for my smaller daughter.  I am using two binder clips to hold the excess strap in a way that is comfortable for her.  Also the bag is only usable on one side.
3.0,I like how it keeps you cool and it's great for working out
3.0,"Purchased this set of clip-ons to facilitate my daily commute as a prescription glasses wearer who needs to drive in varied conditions (rain, dark, very bright sunlight) AND I drive through a dim tunnel as part of that commute. I wear progressive lens prescription glasses. These clip ons cover almost all of my glasses perfectly, but the hinge at the top sticks out a lot on the inside, which keeps my glasses from sitting at the proper place on my face. Hence, it almost renders them un-useable. They do stay attached, they do not scratch the frame or lenses, and they do flip up reliably. Most of the lenses are too dark to wear in overcast conditions and the mirror-tinted ones reflect a lot on the back side and therefore create a lot of optical interference. Would not recommend, even though the lens quality is fairly good."
3.0,This skirt is super cute but it’s ankle length which is not what you see in the description.
3.0,screw fell of after a month
3.0,Todo 👍🏻
3.0,"Very pretty tiny hoops, only problem one came unhooked and lost within 5 minutes of receiving them. ☹"
3.0,shipped fast but item was a bit smaller then expected after doing measurements.
3.0,This is an okay dress to wear for pictures. If you want more out of it it's going to fall apart. Very cheaply made. I bought two for pictures and I haven't even been able to wash them in fear of them falling apart. It's a pretty dress but not well made
3.0,Way too small for size chart
3.0,I was expecting a watch that would make me successful. This isn't it.
3.0,"The bottoms look great and they fit really nice (my husband's point of view).  They might be a little tiny from my point of view.  the top on the other hand is a piece of work.  It took both me and my husband to figure out how to put this thing on and even then, It just doesn't look quite right.  I love the ruched top, which helps hide some of the tummy but I think it's a tad small.  Will probably end up sending back because I just don't think I'll feel comfortable wearing it."
3.0,"I ordered red and a blue... the blue I kept; the red was like an orange red. I didn't like it so it was returned. Very wrinkly, and my first thought of the material was a parachute. I still haven't got the wrinkles out of the blue one, since I don't have an iron... maybe if I lay it flat to dry?"
3.0,nice but doesn't look like it will last.  I think for the price it is alright.
3.0,"Please be aware that these suspenders are nice for the price but are NOT at all grey. At all. They are a very sparkly, metallic silver. The photo from my phone came out pretty well but still doesn't do justice to the sparkle on the silver thread. A very simple and more accurate description would be &#34;silver&#34; instead of grey. But for the price the suspenders are nice and arrived on time and packaged well."
3.0,The 116 shirt runs small I'm 5'0 120 and I ordered my true size (small) it fits but its really snug and I'm afraid if I put it in the dryer it will shrink and I won't be able to fit it at all so I would recommend going a size up for future buyers
3.0,good looking hat but has low quality. overall good for the price.
3.0,Washed a little funny but ok to wear again... little short-waisted
3.0,Watch it when you order the size. These are Asian sizes. Much smaller than U.S sizing. You may need two sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
3.0,"I purchased this dress for my daughter to wear for Easter. When we took it out of the package, I immediately noticed that it was a different material than I expected. It has an almost shiny appearance to it. I expected it to be soft and like a cotton dress. She loved it when she put it on, but it was a little to tight and long on her. Colors were very pretty though , would make a great summer dress. Nice and lightweight."
3.0,I'm a size 12-14.  Was too tight and a bit too short for me.  Loved the detail in the front though.  Order a size up.
3.0,I love the print but the mask was a bit large. Hopefully I can adjust it with my sewing machine so it can fit me better
3.0,"I wear a 34A/34B and ordered a medium. It fits big, I’m hoping it shrinks in the wash! It was cheap though & pretty cute so I can’t complain too much."
3.0,I am giving this brooch three stars because of the pin. It is very thin and bends easily even when passing through thin material. This is my only complaint about this product. It is stylish and looks good on. I recommend it for the specific look it gives but I am unhappy with the light weight thin pin.
3.0,This shirt runs large. The small is probably for a 10 year old
3.0,"I love the look of this dress....I went off the size chart and ordered it - it was about a size too small. Disappointed, but... oh well - back it went. It appeared to be well made though so maybe size up from what they state."
3.0,I like the band itself but it is too tight on my small wrist Sadly I can not use it
3.0,"Very pretty.  Good concept, but as soon as you bend over, the phone falls out.  Needs a little Velcro or something to hold phone in."
3.0,"Pretty cute, but nearly see through."
3.0,I wasn't able to get the cuff to fit properly so that it wouldn't fall off. It looks cool though. I can find some use for it.
3.0,Good product only problem is the paint rubs off the black and green ones with not much use.
3.0,Shirt messed up as soon as I dried it
3.0,"I would’ve loved to keep this dress. The color is a shade brighter than the picture with very pretty and delicate crochet. However it arrived with frays along the left side of the dress where the thinner crochet meets the side stitching.  Bummer, had to return."
3.0,I returned these. They looked cute in the box but weird on my feet. The front part of the shoe starts right in the middle of the widest part of my foot. Like where the ball of your foot begins. It made the shoe take a weird shape and made it feel like my pinky toe was about to slide out of one of the holes.
3.0,I was expecting the fabric to be much thicker and the the x large to be 12-14. But that wasn't the case when I got it!<br />I will keep it and give it to someone smaller than myself.
3.0,"Pretty pattern, kind of busy and  it is very heavy."
3.0,This is not a successful product. The fabric combination is just to strange. Stretchy nylon top is connected to the skirt of the dress with a wide ribbon that has gold lurex thread in it. The Egyptian motif doesn't got with the ribbon or the black bodice at all.
3.0,Tight and a little uncomfortable in the armpit area.
3.0,3 stars because the suit is beautiful. It just was too small for my boobs. I'm G-GG cup and this suit does nothing for us chest blessed women. The bottoms fit fine though.
3.0,Fits fine but the band loosens throughout the day. It's like the magnet isn't strong enough to stay in place with movement.  Doesn't fall off but I have to readjust about once a day.
3.0,"These are very pretty and the pictures don't do them justice.  But, with that said I was disappointed in the size of them.  They are big; a lot bigger than I anticipated and they will not work for a tragus or cartilidge piercing in my opinion - which is what I wanted them for.  They look like they would work great as a faux zero for someone looking to see if that is something they would like, or for a teen that wants the look of a zero but has parents that won't allow such a large hole in their earlobes."
3.0,"these earrings are very cute, however, there is not a metal post on the back it is some sort of rubber and I hope it holds up to the task. it was packaged well and arrived fast. Thank you"
3.0,Looks cool but it got scratched after two days by one of my other CHAINZ.  Gotta spend the $$$ for quality jewelry.
3.0,It is definitely not a real stone. Don’t know what the actual piece is made from. Seems like a fancy plastic up on her. I was desperate for a gift so I gave it to her. Like it. Thank
3.0,"They seem to be ok and feel good, but I made sure to order from the US, and it's all Japanese. There is nothing anywhere on socks or tags for me to be able to tell if these really are 100% wool. Since I ordered 100% wool gloves and it was not as advertised,  I am more leery than ever."
3.0,good quality BUT very weird pant sizes!!! do not match regular sizes and way too slim even for skinny boys
3.0,80% Cotton<br />20% Polyester<br /><br />Does not add up to 100% cotton. This is the second brand in the last two weeks I purchased that claims to be 100% cotton that is not.
3.0,The shoes are pretty but not practical.  They don't stay on your feet.  There is no buckle.  Just holes to thread the ribbons trough.
3.0,Alot smaller than expected...
3.0,colors were off
3.0,"I wanted to love this dress, but the pockets are sewn into the seams on the side. And not attached to the dress. Which means the pockets push the dress out at the sides, right at the hips, & that just ruins the lines & look of the dress. I returned it."
3.0,It’s a little tight!
3.0,Fell apart fairly quick other than that its a good wallet.
3.0,"Bought these for an adult man and while they worked fine the actual ear circles are pretty small, like smaller than my Minnie ones. Maybe find an alternative if it’s for someone who isn’t a child."
3.0,"I bought the 3-hook 3/4 inch clip thinking the overall width was 3/4&#34;, but when it arrived it was quite large. According to the Rixie Clip website, the 3/4&#34; measurement is the spacing between the hooks, not the overall size, and they list the overall width on the site as well. Look through the Rixie Clip website for sizing before ordering from here (it's also cheaper on there as of this posting)."
3.0,"Bought these boxer briefs for work,  since I work at a heat treat facility. I needed something to keep me cool and dry which they do a good job of, but my only problem is with the quality. After the first wash “I followed the care instructions carefully” they seem to fray at the waistband  and also there’s a “run” in the material and that’s my first pair the other two are still new in the plastic wrap<br />And almost $60 for the three I would expected better"
3.0,Nice color but poor quality
3.0,"The anklet has a very nice silky feel and fit other than it tends to slide down somewhat on the ankle. My ankles are pretty normal. If it would stay up like pictured, I could wear them with the ankle pants I have.  Unfortunately they end up with the band showing.  Maybe if they were foot shaped instead of tube shaped, they might stay in place better."
3.0,"Not able to tell what time it is , because big and small needle same color as background"
3.0,If this was made with a better material (like beach towel) it would be great.
3.0,On the small side.
3.0,These boots ran really small and narrow compared to other INC boots I've purchased in the past.  Quality was on par with the brand.
3.0,"I returned this one, I didn't care for the fit, it rides too high up and exposes some back.  I was not comfortable in this style.  99% of the things I buy from Patty Boutique are excellent, this one just didn't do it for me."
3.0,It’s cute but didn’t realize that the deer had a bow on its head so I couldn’t use this outfit for my son
3.0,"This watch is absolutely nice, beautiful, elegant!, but so fast I had problems with it on a raining day, water got into him,  when it is supposed is water resistant. Then, three months later from buying, battery got drained so i had to spent money changing it."
3.0,"When my solar-rechargeable Casio showed signs of dying (which turned out to be just a symptom of chronically low battery) I chose this as a Vine selection to use as a nighttime watch and possibly as substitute for the Apple watch I use during the day. As you know from the marker on the review I got this as a &#34;free&#34; product for review - actually as Vine items are now treated as taxable income it was essentially 70% off. For purposes of this review, however, I review as though I paid full price - which in this case very nearly caused me to lower the review to 2 stars.<br /><br />Upon opening the box unlike any other watch I've owned it does not operate - it must be linked with their phone app. So, first you download the app and of course you have to create an account and agree to their privacy policies, etc. The bluetooth linkup was easy and then the time showed up on the watch after a calibration procedure.<br /><br />Initial impression is an industrial type design which is actually a lot larger than my Apple watch (see picture). I was planning on wearing them both on the same wrist for a day to compare step counts, etc. The case on this watch is very rough, however, and that would have left my Apple watch severely scratched on that side - so I did testing with it on the right wrist. If you wear a bracelet or anything with this watch, it will get scratched.<br /><br />I wore it for several hours doing some work around the house and a short workout. The step counts seemed accurate and similar to my Apple watch counts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Style (assuming you like the look)<br />Large (assuming you like a very large watch)<br />Very solidly built / heavy<br /><br />Cons:<br />Must be linked with phone<br />No second hand (I work in the medical field and need one for checking pulse)<br />Rough sides<br /><br />Overall, I'm not too impressed with this offering for reasons above especially at this high price point."
3.0,Affordable but.... they are huge! Weigh a lot. Might be fun for a costume party.
3.0,Don’t know why I thought this would look good on me in the first place. It’s a tiny top … would probably look best on a young lady with a flat belly. I am older with a little bit of a belly … my battle scars after having babies!  But it would look great on someone with no belly!
3.0,The pants were not long enough. It for a 5'2 person when theoretically a large should fit a 5'7-5'9 person.
3.0,"The 63 pairs its just a great price, however dot too excited when i unwrapped them and noticed that instead of being 63 different style of earrings, it turned out to be 20 different styles just packed extra ones of the same style just to fill up the 63 earring pair spaces."
3.0,I was disappointed both in the material and the style.  Just wasn't exactly what I expected.
3.0,NOT BIG TOTE SMALL
3.0,I really like it but one of the crystals was detached
3.0,Didn't fit as I thought the material is good
3.0,The banding folds weird and the bottoms banding had a broken line in it.
3.0,i'm happy with my item. i wish it was a little bigger but other then that it is fine and came when it said it would.
3.0,I’m a 32D and feel that the D cup was much too large in size from top to bottom. It is either on my rib cage on the bottom or showing really high on top.
3.0,This shirt comea from China so I should have ordered a small instead of medium. It was much larger then expected. The material was great and was really cute. I gave it away.
3.0,Durable and adjustable size! Ordered 2 colors and love them! Would buy it again! Stiff enough for a holster or phone case. Keeps pants where I'd like them to stay also! I love how bright the army green and purple are the blue one is not as bright and widths are not the same 😔
3.0,seem a bit cheap and flimsy.
3.0,It is cute but it is very itchy.
3.0,Son bonitos pero muy rustico pero esta bien por el precio
3.0,It was a cute dress but just didn’t work for me. I’m 5 ft and 130lbs and got a small. It fit fine but I didn’t like how long it was on me. The material is a little cheap and thin too.
3.0,Matterial was a little thin
3.0,"It's alright.  I should have read about it more before purchasing.  It's rather young, so it didn't work for me at all."
3.0,They are really nice but they are bendable and not make very sturdy. I was expecting a solid earring. It’s okay for casual wear but not an extended evening out wear.
3.0,fabric is not soft
3.0,"The style is cute but the color is completely off I ordered a green and instead I  received an aqua color, it was going to be part of a cosplay but unfortunately I can't use it"
3.0,"Be sure to measure yourself length wise, from chest to crotch. Im 5'4&#34; and this was too short on me."
3.0,"As other review states, seems like it would wrinkle easily and one of the lapels doesn’t lay flat without ironing.  It came wrinkled out of the vacuum sealed package, but a quick spritz with water and tumble in the dryer got all that out.  Will look very cute for an Easter outfit and could go with jeans, navy pants or khaki"
3.0,"Ok so 5 Stars for delivery speed, comfort, and it being a great deal. BUT I have very tiny wrists and the holes stop about a  centimeter too short from where I need it.<br /><br />That being said, finding watch bands for my watch (The Fossil Gen 5 Julianna HR) is hard and I decided to purchase this deal knowing that I'd probably have to alter them. Which I did. I added my own holes (with a drill bit) and cut off about an inch off the bands so they would sit more comfortably. After that, they are perfect and I'm very happy with my purchase!"
3.0,Good Sweater- GOOD Quality- GREAT PRICE
3.0,"The bracelet is beautiful; after a month it still is maintaining its finish. However, I have had at least 5 occasions where the end ball unscrewed and my charms have fallen off. Luckily I have been able to locate all my charms. I will have to purchase a different bracelet to avoid losing my charms."
3.0,It was a  tight fit but I don't think it's anything I can't tolerate.
3.0,White turtleneck is the definition of sheer. I can see my skin clearly through it. The black one is similar but better because it’s black. Comfy but the material is too thin to wear by itself.
3.0,"The glasses are not polarized. Opened the box which was nice packaging. It came with a small card that says wear glasses to see beautiful pattern. Well no pattern, the card does work because I tested it on another polarized pair of glasses. Overall they do cut some glare at night."
3.0,Broke at link as soon as we got it. Had to fix to wear.
3.0,"The shoes do fit, but they run slightly large. The cut around the angle was not fitted so the shoes are bulky and loose. I cannot tell if this is made out of genuine leather, but will keep the shoes."
3.0,This shirt is ok for under a flannel or something.  Material is very this not great quality.
3.0,"The wand was described as “high quality resin material,” but the wand we received was 2 pieces of crappy plastic held together poorly with a tiny screw. There is a small battery compartment and speaker holes in the bottom of the wand, but no button or switch to turn it on. It is so cheaply made and poorly held together that we threw it out and ordered another wand. The rest of the set is ok, the tie and scarf are the best parts, but the glasses are also super cheap plastic."
3.0,"Works eventually, had to boil them so hot the thing burned my gums at first, otherwise it wasnt gooey enough to mold right... But itll work if you give it the time, pain, and tears lol"
3.0,"Despite the price, I was hopeful for a great sock. But I was disappointed. Sick offers a wide size range, but even at my size 9.5, it was a tight fit. Then I washed them and let air dry. They still shrunk"
3.0,"Thinner than I expected, I was hoping this would fit like another quicksilver sweater I have but it didn't."
3.0,Fit small but it cute. The shirt is definitely one jump short of revealing my chest but it's cute for the price.
3.0,"I don't know, I guess I was expecting more . Next time I'll read more thoroughly lol."
3.0,Thinner material but not bad. medium fits like a medium but sleeves are more like a small medium.
3.0,"Purchased for my daughter. She loves it, however after a handful of times wearing it the tie in the beck has worn a bit. She will have a few more wears out of it until it breaks all together."
3.0,Not bad for the money simple light weight
3.0,This is exactly what I expected and we will great for event I am attending.
3.0,The earrings are gorgeous but they are too big and hang a bit off. Did not sit right on my ear. They are beautiful.
3.0,Very warm and liked the fit
3.0,overall was too small
3.0,Heavy<br />Doesn't bend<br />Looks like a cow bell around your neck
3.0,"I expected this sweater to be a nice shade of neutral taupe/mocha/brown. When it arrived, it was a shade of yellowish gold-beige. For that reason, I'm returning the sweater and purchasing in Wine Red instead. The color isn't bad, just not flattering on my pale skin, so not for me. The fit was very nice, could be worn off one shoulder, off both shoulders, or as a boat-neck. The quality seemed to be very nice as well, so that's why I'm still repurchasing."
3.0,"This was almost 5 stars, but something's off with the inside of this suit case. When you unzip the inside compartment, it's not covered in fabric or anything it's all metal and pieces are taped up. Really strange. I might've received a unfinished piece andplan to contact the manufacturer just in case, because this can't be right????"
3.0,"It fit ok, but I wasn't a huge fan of the weight of the visor or the pullouts. I also don't like the look of it. It is not flattering. I also don't like the visors down as I feel like it messes with my eye/vision and makes me feel enclosed. I didn't wear it long before I started getting a little bit of a headache or it was bothering me to where I will be getting a headache. I have issues if I wear a hat too long or it is too heavy.<br />I gave it three stars because it is well-made so if the above issues do not bother people than they might really like it."
3.0,too big for me personally. wouldn’t re-buy.
3.0,They arrived and two pairs of the earrings already had some of the colored jewels fall out and were in the bottom of the bag.
3.0,"Love the look and the color. Unfortunately the clip on strap will not stay on. Oops, I had a stap around my wrist and a nice looking wallet on the ground. Finally gave up on the strap. Should have returned though."
3.0,I bought this bracelet for a godchild and she was very happy when she got it. However when she wore it to a concert on a muggy summer night her wrist turned green. She likes the bracelet but is going to be limited in wearing it. We are hoping the green color was just due to dampness.
3.0,cheaply made but good reflective surface
3.0,"Beautiful pants, but fits very tight through the hips and groin area. I’m 5’5 - 146#. Fit well everywhere else."
3.0,Really cute and good looking.Just that zipper is useless.It's too narrow to change a diaper or to put it on a baby.My advice is to order one size bigger.
3.0,"I usually don’t buy clothing online but I thought I give this one a go.  I purchased it using an amazon affiliate link.  Truthfully, I liked the leggings, I was shocked they were true to the size.  However; I am still not happy with the quality of material on the online clothing.  I might be a bit picky I guess but I probably won’t be buying anything clothes related online.  I prefer quality material and much rather pay a little more to get better quality."
3.0,Pink/blue was cute but too small. My daughter is consistently an xs/s and this was way too short even for a crop top. We ordered size small. Never would have thought she would need a medium. Barely covered her bra. Returned it. Might purchase again.
3.0,"This visor just arrived. Definitely NOT adjustable. I wouldn't have purchased it. Might turn out ok anyway. I'm going to give it a try.<br />EDIT-- it is stretchy, not adjustable. And it still causes a headache so I'll be giving this away."
3.0,opened the container it came in which was a very cute small clear container and i picked up the first bag at the top and it was those earrings. i could see the the wing had fallen off before i even opened the bag or took the earrings out. all the other earrings are still intact but i guess i shouldn’t have expected much for 10 dollars.
3.0,they ripped the first time I put them onn. a bit too thin for me
3.0,I thought these would be helpful for my two boys and keeping track of their masks. But honestly you get a good amount for the price but the clips that hold the mask fall off very easy. My oldeat has gone through three of them. Honestly that could be two he doesnt take care of things very well. He spins them around. But you think they be design to hold up better. The string is nicely made and is strong. I would just say update the part that clips onto sting and mask. It is easy to fall off. Other then that these are not to bad and have done the job.
3.0,The photo makes the two blacks look closer in shade than in actuality. The bottom half looks like a super faded black. It fits super but the two tones are odd
3.0,Small and light is very dim
3.0,"I was so excited to get this today I anxiously waited for the mail man, when I opened it I was very pleased it was gorgeous! It had a brilliant shine and the opal turtle shell was beautiful, I put it on right away and noticed that the beads slid way to much and it was hard to keep the turtle dangling at the ankle where it could easily be seen I took it off and at close examination one of the blue beads was actually broken, a large crack was in it actually a small piece was chipped off at one of the opening ends which is why I only gave it 3 stars, although it is a little irritating to keep sliding the beads and turtle back into place it really is beautiful"
3.0,"Way bigger than I thought, my grandson is still waiting to grow into it six months later."
3.0,I need the cables!!!! They were not in the box<br />Please send as soon as posable need the for<br />Birthday gift
3.0,"Three stars for the color and design, but they were too constricting to be comfortable and much too high for me.  I kept them on for as long as I could...less than 30 minutes.  I like to wear compression stockings when I travel long distances on a plane as my feet and ankles tend to swell.  The ones I have are white and look like I just got out of a hospital.  I was hoping these would work as they're very cute looking."
3.0,"Not as nice as I thought it would be, but it's okay, and comfortable."
3.0,"super cute, but *far* too large! i ordered a size smaller and it falls off every other step...even after tightening the laces. ref: my daughter wears a size 7, i ordered a 6."
3.0,This was a birthday present. I was disappointed with the quality. The printing was too faint and looked cheap.
3.0,"Cool gloves for a costume accessory. They were very tight, barely fit though. For the price, they were fine."
3.0,Clasps are cheap plastic. Had to super glue them to stop them from coming undone. Very light wait band. About right for the low cost. All is all I’m glad I got this as I will be able to use my fitbit for another year.
3.0,"It really should look more like a heart, but it will do for now."
3.0,Gift for my grand daughter.
3.0,"I couldn't find a size on my invoice. But, I can't imagine I ordered an adult XL for my 12 year old."
3.0,"This shirt is OK.  It does attract static cling though, so be prepared.  the sleeves don't stay rolled, so it just kinda hangs on the part that hooks it up.<br /><br />I'm a real person and did NOT receive this item at a discount in lieu of a positive review.  By clicking &#34;helpful&#34; at the bottom of this review, it will help move &#34;real&#34; reviews to the top.  Thanks in advance."
3.0,I would love them if they were smaller.  I am an average size woman and they give me giant &#34;bug&#34; eyes
3.0,The outfit is cute. The bottom half is what I feel is a bit on the small side. Or the sleeves are on the larger side? Overall it's ok. Not the nicest material and there are exposed buttons on the inside but baby doesn't seem to be bothered by it. Overall I think the outfit would be good for a cute photo shoot but probably not for everyday wear. We will see how it stands up to the wash.
3.0,It was adorable but fit too big and the material isn’t the best but it worked for pictures
3.0,"It is a good latex mask. Has that latex smell, but will air out. Looks like the picture, so no complaints"
3.0,The state / shape of the state of Indiana was tiny - nothing like the picture. Was quite disappointed. Also got one with South Carolina and that one was much larger
3.0,I bought these and based on some reviews that they run small I ordered size 40 (I'm a 38). They arrived and I tried them on but they were too big on me. It looked like I was wearing a long skirt. I returned them and got a refund.
3.0,"Needed some simple sneakers for summer to replace my old ones.  I usually by converse, but these were cheeper and same style. They looked nice and are ok on comfort, but they have started to fall apart much sooner then the converse typically do."
3.0,"I wear 34” pants and so I ordered large. They are a little snug but not uncomfortable.  Since I have been wearing loose fitting boxers for many years, these took some getting used to. My wife loves them. Enough said."
3.0,I bought these for my son. He plays basketball and I thought these would be great for under his jersey. They run small and for some reason the right underarm seam rubs him weird. It does this on all of the shirts from this pack.
3.0,Too small in the chest and waist is too high
3.0,This product did give me the results I expected but it is not made of the best quality. I had to reinforce the sewing over the steel bones in the corset to keep them from popping out. I would order something similar but might spend a little more money for a higher quality one that will last longer.
3.0,The material is amazing and light and the design is just what I was looking for...slightly bigger than I expected but the style is so versatile It can go with anything
3.0,"Bought for a teenager.  It's too big for her.  Detail was good, but just not quite what I wanted for her."
3.0,"It came with a very bad cheap clasp, i had to go to the jeweler to get a new one on and now its much better, the bracelet is pretty just wish i didn't have to spend more money on it because the clasp broke of as soon as i opened it."
3.0,I really liked the material this shirt is made of. I purchased to wear under tanks and strappy dresses and tops. The one issue I had was the neckline. It looks like a men’s tee shirt and not the look I wanted. Has a extremely casual look. If it had a thinner more feminine neck I would have given five stars
3.0,Very cheap material but you get what you pay for. I got this in the mail and the material was super wrinkly and staticky. Hopefully it washes okay.
3.0,Too tight on calf
3.0,the description says it fits most infants but it really a kids hat.  Still good quality with a Velcro strap but I rated it low because it is not for an infant
3.0,I do not like that the high waist band rolls down. It makes it uncomfortable. Also they are see-through. I dont like either.
3.0,"Smell really bad. If you don't care about the smell, then add 1 to 2 stars to my review."
3.0,Cute ring just too small in stature for my hand. More appropriate for a teenager.
3.0,"I ordered the cognac, as it looked beautiful online.  However the band I received is much lighter in color.  In light it has a putty appearance, very consistent coloration (to its detriment).  I was ready to be &#34;wowed&#34; with something that looked like the online image.  For $10, I'll try a band that is questionable.  For $35, this might have to go back :(.<br />Update: My smartwatch came early, so I've decided to keep the band in order to be able to wear it - It can look a little darker when not in direct light (see watch picture).  Maybe my sweat will help darken it, add some variation (yuck)."
3.0,Glasses keep slipping off. Have had to secure them with small elastic bands....
3.0,The ties look great but they're thin material and aren't the best.
3.0,"I wanted to love this, it’s comfortable and I’ve gotten compliments on it but it started piling very shortly after I stared wearing it.  Within a few days.  They’re easy enough to pull off, but it’s a bit annoying."
3.0,"The small should have fit my son who wears 4t-5t, but it ran very small."
3.0,"Does what I expected. I will not wear this without a shirt over it though because on me, this is not flattering."
3.0,"Comfortable fit. When he Adam arrived a lot of the paint had been chipped off and the piece that connects from the forehead to the bottom of the I was broken off. I fixed it with Superglue and repainted it myself. You can tell it's flawed and doesn't perfectly match, but I'll keep it."
3.0,It's a nice band bu4 one of my pins keep coming out so I can't use it cause I'll lose my watch
3.0,"light function is very dim and doesnt cover the entire screen, cant really use it in dark areas<br />it sure is a watch though"
3.0,Jacket is just ok.  I don’t think it’s as amazing as some others described.  Quality is good but just didn’t like how it fit on me and buckle was annoying to open and close.  Will be returning.
3.0,Es tan muy bien pero las tallas son muy reducidas y le quedó muy ajustado
3.0,Cute suit but fits small! I could have made due with the top but the bottoms were too tight. I had to return this and buy a larger size. For size reference I’m 5”2 124 lbs and a 36C. I do love the colors and design of this suit.
3.0,"They’re a bit more rosy gold, and the backings bend easily. But they are very good for the price and mine haven’t broken yet. just the heavier ones sometimes strain with the weight i think."
3.0,"These are as pictured, sort of. Here is what you need to know:<br />1. They are very heavy<br />2. The yellow crescents have black writing on one side for copyrite stuff, which looks incredibly stupid, but thankfully I was able to remove it with a nail file<br />3. The pearls are humongous (which isn't very accurate for cosplay, not to mention adding to the heaviness problem) so you can replace them with smaller ones if you have tiny pliers like I do<br />4. The crescents are kinda too big to wear every day and pull off without looking tacky. But for cosplay that doesn't matter.<br />Overall not bad but I had to modify them a bit to be wearable in my opinion."
3.0,"Like most reviews , these are TINY !! They are very hard to handle because of their size. But overall there cute when and if you can get them in. Gave them 3 stars because i had a hard time with the smaller hoop closing , once again because of their size."
3.0,My daughter is a petite 5yoand thought the 5T would be the right fit. It was ok fitting on the top. She would grow out of it within 6 months but the skirt portion was short. Hit right at her knee. Dress barely twirled. Returning
3.0,Get what you pay for.  They do the job but are not made especially well. Cannot beat the price though
3.0,Not as supportive as I had hoped. If worn all day my foot hurts.
3.0,"Ehh you know, cheaply made but looks cute.  You get what you pay for."
3.0,"I usually pineapple my hair for bed, but noticed that my hair was breaking so I decided to get try this turban.  One, it's hard to get on.  Probably takes practice.  Second, when I put my mid-length hair into it, I find that almost all of my wave is gone by the next morning.  And third, it doesn't stay on well.  I put this on at night when I would normally pineapple my hair (eat dinner, watch tv, etc.), and it falls off after a while."
3.0,"I ordered this sandal in my regular size 10. The size marked inside the sandal said 40, European equivalent to size 10. When I removed the sandals from the box they looked small. I tried them on and my toes hung over the end, otherwise they felt really comfortable. Do they run small or did I receive a flawed pair?? So disappointing..."
3.0,I needed a petite in this dress in overall sizing! I tried going down a size but still very big!
3.0,"Sturdy fanny pack, the fabric however is very cheap."
3.0,awful fabric
3.0,My toddler will like these but expected slipper to be more plush/ soft. Does look like picture but quality is not great.
3.0,cute shorts but only received one pair... not three as pictured. =/
3.0,I was sorta disappointed with this dress. I looked at it online a dozen times before I bit the bullet and purchased and I feel sorta meh about it.  I guess I don't have the right body type as the hip area almost comes up to my chest.  This causes the bottom half of the dress to flare out far up my torso and makes me look bigger than I actually am.  I'm hoping maybe if I lose a few pounds it'll be more flattering.
3.0,"Fits ok. It doesn’t usually snap directly in line, usually I have to force it to line up. I have other ‘leather’ bands that always snap right in a  perfect line every time. This was more money and the magnets seem a bit off - but otherwise, once you get it on, it is great."
3.0,I love it it’s great for when you don’t need a bigger purse.
3.0,Flimsy frame but I still love them
3.0,I don't care much for batwings. It clings instead of fitting loosely. Colors are nice though.
3.0,"very cute, but smells extremely bad! had to wash it over and over again, as well as air it out.. the odor smelled of car yard."
3.0,Nice but broke after short time
3.0,"It's only my 3 time wearing these. They are comfortable and stylish.<br /><br />However, the width is stretched out such that the shoe falls off as I'm walking. If I go down a size (maybe ½?) will the length be okay?<br /><br />I like them enough that I might try a smaller pair."
3.0,A bit tight and alil smell to the shirt if I could get a different one resent that would be fine
3.0,The box is to small for all the jewerly but just the jewlery alone is worth the price
3.0,"Dainty and comfy, but rotate around my foot vice staying in place. Stay up, just not where they should."
3.0,Very nice coat...had to return because the size runs VERY small.
3.0,Solid product... paint started chipping off right away...
3.0,"Nice material but way longer than expected. I am short, 5'2"". Debating whether to keep it, just wearing with tall heals or giving to my tall friend. I do like it; debating..."
3.0,"I bought this dress for my daughter. The sizing definitely seems off because I purchased a way bigger size based on the age range options and it still doesn’t fit.<br />The top part of the dress is gorgeous, but the bottom does not really look like in the pictures"
3.0,"Absolutely no added fabric at the crotch and completely smashed my small chest. Cute style, I just feel every suit should have a crotch inside of some kind, and I didn’t expect to have no support at all at the chest"
3.0,"The blue ones work great, but the black ones burn when they are worn.  It feels like a chemical burn."
3.0,Returned top.  The fit wasn’t as expected.. too large… not flattering on me.
3.0,"Vibrant color's, nice design, very much too small"
3.0,This shirt does not have any drape in the front like the one in the photos. It's tight across the front. Had I known that I never would have bought it.
3.0,The pockets don’t lay flat.  I find I am adjusting them every time I stand up.  They just kind of stick out weird.  Fabric was nice.
3.0,"Cute print, good quality but the seam hits right between the “cheeks” and my daughter was so bothered by it she won’t wear it. I wish she would because it cute."
3.0,Ordered a size 10 and it’s closer to size 6/8.
3.0,Not great for swimming laps. The zipper kept rubbing my neck and pulling my hair.
3.0,I love it..I use one the other they  .... and everybody like it. ... :))<br />Thank You Amazon
3.0,Beautiful runs small
3.0,Beautiful get a lot of compliments but did break on me after a few months
3.0,Good however no explanation on how to get it on but wasn't a big issue because YouTube exist and only other issue was shoulder pieces kept falling but I decided to get a robe to put over the costume and that worked well
3.0,Too large. Size is not accurate.
3.0,Really small. Not for preteen more like a toddler. Cute but really small.
3.0,"The thicker black-n-silver bracelet was made of some sort of plastic with a coating spiral wrapped around it. The bracelet itself was broken, so only the plastic was holding it together. The rest of the bangles were fine"
3.0,"Received today. I purchased for my son; 16. 6’2, slim build, tall, weighting between 140-160 (he grows so fast!). I picked the large because I felt it would be loose enough but fit comfortably. The shirt came looking as though it would fit a 2xl at least and the pants were of normal large but were too Short for his size. Pants would fit someone that is about 5’5-5’8. Would have returned but it just happened my co worker has a son that would fit in them wonderfully.<br />Quality of flannel was nice. Color was true to picture. I am giving this a 3 simply because I felt like the top and bottoms were completely different sizes and didn’t work for my son and his build.  I feel like the shirt was almost a “big and tall” Large."
3.0,I guess for the price I can't complain.
3.0,"Cut is as shown, fabric thin and inexpensive looking. Much brighter color than pictured. Returning."
3.0,"Pretty, but very stiff and a little too large."
3.0,Cute top after I had read the reviews I knew it run small I order a xl and I’m usually a M some stuff a L the XL just fits! Cotton but looks cute
3.0,Had hair I didn’t want to show when I bought this. But it’s to used much since cutting my hair low— low maintenance!! The hat will work well when trying to keep warm. Glad it had a hair friendly lining
3.0,"The quality is nice, but it is much much shorter than shown.  I usually wear a 2x, I had to order a 6x. It fit well around but the bust is extremely to big. I have size 38D and it is barely touching my skin with no support."
3.0,I found the waist very high and tight and the legs too short for my 5' 7&#34; frame at 130 lbs.
3.0,"Beware these pants are not cotton denim. They are polyester and more like slacks than jeans. I have been wearing this brand jeans for years and were disappointed in the fabric. The fit and quality were fine, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,The bottoms are not green. They are teal.
3.0,I thought the fabric was too thick and difficult to breath through. I was able to cut a layer out for more comfortable breathing.<br />Also they are a bit on the small side for an adult man
3.0,"These earrings are beautiful!  They were a little larger than I thought/would've liked.  That aside, I would've kept them if they weren't so uncomfortable!  I wore them for a mere hour and my ear lobes were already hurting!  If you can handle the pain, get these because they are stunning, but if not stay away!"
3.0,This bracelet was really well made and looks very nice in person. It fit well and I was pretty happy about it. The only downside is the clasp is magnetic and can easily come undone. Mine ended up falling off after a few days without me noticing and I didn’t find it.
3.0,Empire waistline is going to lay strange on anyone above a B cup.
3.0,"Bought this for.my husband while he's at work, it's alright it's a little hard to use when he's working the boards in the mill but he's happy with it for price, it's a fair quality"
3.0,Bet everywhere however the built in belt made it extremely difficult to zip
3.0,"UPDATE:<br />I was finally able to get this attached to my Fitbit. I had to attach it at an angle. It's not as flexible as my other bands but it's ok.  Love the colors.<br /><br />I can not get this attached to my Fitbit!  I tried a different pin and that didn't help.  It seems as if the end of the band, where you attach it to the Versa, is thicker then my other bands.  Very disappointed with this product!  This review applies to the Berry and Hunter Green colored bands  The Dark Red band fit my Versa fine."
3.0,"I received this belt (gold, X-lrg) within 2 days. It is a high quality product and beautiful. However, it is only 1-1/4 inches wide and 38 inches long. Fortunately I can still use it but it might be to thin in width to wear it as I planned? I'm disappointed it's not at least 3 inches wide. Now  I'll need to buy another gold belt."
3.0,Shorter than expected.  Slim fit and stylish.
3.0,The waist is a little big in my case needs a belt apart from that ok for the price
3.0,It's ok pretty flimsy.
3.0,"If you are large chested, this isn’t for you.  The pleated bust area, did not cover my chest.  The bottom of the pleats should be under the bust and were not.  It would be difficult to wear a bra with this dress.  The sides (arm pit area) of my bra showed.  I hate my bra showing.<br /><br />The color was nice.  I ordered the light blue color.  The material is soft, but kind of thin.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 172 lbs.  I am a 36 DDD.  The dress basically fit as expected.  It was the correct size.  I ordered an XL."
3.0,Flimsy thin cotton with long threads hanging in various areas...
3.0,Is okay..soft material and i received pretty fast.
3.0,My son LOVED it! However it faded fast and pilled horribly!
3.0,"Got these for Burning Man, they are basically cut like skinny jeans, which require you to be, well... skinny."
3.0,Front is pretty.  The back is flat so it looks a little fake.
3.0,"The pendant very nice, the chain was not the size it said and the clasp hoops are no good, overall worth the few dollars I spent."
3.0,Good qaulity material strength-wise. I wish it was more stretchy to fit my curves. It smashes and doesn't support the body shape.
3.0,"Good thought, not good fit or material"
3.0,The sizing is way off. Too small.
3.0,I am returning the item. I wanted the bigger hoops and in gold. Not rose gold. The earrings were very pretty just not the size I wanted. So returning and will be ordering the bigger hoops in the gold.
3.0,It's okay but the dress running little  small and it looks cheap. I'm thinking about returning it.
3.0,I’ve been having to use men’s but these are far too big
3.0,Not as high quality as their printed ones.  A little too loose for me.
3.0,These socks seem much thinner than traditional Nike Elite socks but seem to withstand the wear and tear as well.
3.0,way too big for a 5 year old girl to wear
3.0,The color of the dress was perfect. But way to big.
3.0,"I'm satisfied with the ring. It looks good on you finger. I just wish the titanium did not have as much shine to it. I wish it was a brushed look, but I'm not even sure they can do that titanium."
3.0,the rouch in the back of this pic was not on the dress...sent it back
3.0,"They fit and feel great but one pair came with a cross threaded screw on one of the hinges, which makes them wobbly on one side. O tried to fix it but it keeps following the old threads and won't go to the bottom to anchor the arm in. That's all."
3.0,"I think these are really cool pants, but sadly they just did not look good when wearing. I am 5' and about 135 pounds. So this style is definitely not for those who are petite with some extra weight. I returned these. Would look great on someone taller."
3.0,It was a nice product but it only lasted a year.
3.0,"I purchased these and the AmazonBasics ones and I personally preferred the AmazonBasics ones.  I will be returning the TravelWise ones.<br /><br />The TravelWise ones I received from &#34;EatSmart Products&#34; was a little different than pictured.  Specifically the zippers on the product I received did not have any of the thread/rope and was just a standard larger zipper which was less easy to open.<br /><br />Also, the material used on the TravelWise ones was a little thicker and more cloth like ones from Amazon which was thinner and seemed more malleable for when I will be packing them into my suitcase."
3.0,"Not bad for the price. Looks as good as in the pictures. Very soft and comfey to wear. They could have spent more than 2 cents on the zipper. I see myself having it replaced with a quality zipper in the near future hoping the hoodie will last that long. You can't expect much from something ""Made in China"" these days cuz they have even less honorable business folk than America. But it's not bad for the price and I'll be happy if I get 2 years out of it before it falls apart. We live in a disposable society so I suppose it's appropriate for these times. It's good as I was expecting.... 3 stars."
3.0,the tie on the back ripped off the first time i wore it
3.0,For my daughter. My wife sent it back because it was kind of thin & unflattering. She said it could have been made better. Stitching detail wasn’t great
3.0,"They are pretty, but I ordered what I thought were white colored earrings, these are pink. I'm going to keep them, I will still wear them but the pictures do not accurately display the product."
3.0,"The colour is okay, but the loop is cheap. I suppose that's what you get for the price. I'd buy it again, but only because I'm broke and can't afford a nicer quality one"
3.0,"The fit is pretty nice. I like my suit jacket to hug me and this worked. The material is strange though; it reminds me of the same texture as those reusable grocery bags, but it's not uncomfortable."
3.0,Ordered a size xxl and it ran very small. I don't think it's worth trying to replace with a larger size so I'm just returning it. 3 star rating is to be neutral because I'm not actually using the product.
3.0,It's ok. I love flannels so I'll keep it but it is a SUPER thin material. Definitely not anything to wear in the colder temps unless over a hoodie.
3.0,"I ordered a size up because of what the other reviews had said, however I found it to be too large. So if you're tinier (I'm 5'3&#34; 100 lbs) you might be okay sticking with your regular size. I ended up cutting the shirt cus I'm lazy and hate return stuff online looks nice tucked in"
3.0,"I like this bra but I wear a 36 C but thank all you girls for the warning so I purchased the  38 D wow still too tight, I added the bra extentions so I'll keep but next time I'll get the 40 D.<br />I always purchased Delicates but they no longer make them these are more molded than I like but so far these are best."
3.0,To small order at least 2 sizes up
3.0,Sizing is difficult for me. It doesn’t lift up as good and over time the adhesive bundles up. Not for me. I only used it a few times when i need a strapless look.
3.0,Love the outfit I ordered it for Christmas dress up day for my daughters school next week. The outfit will fit her but this hat won’t even fit my 2 year old son much less the head of a 6 year old. Alittle disappointing that she can’t wear the full outfit
3.0,If you lay on it or press it the wrong way it hurts your ear. The edges are a bit sharp
3.0,This is a very petty neckless very nice quality but...the chain hook...that keeps the neckless toghether...opened already 3 times. The hook goes right thru the closed latch. I am so mad because i really like it.
3.0,"I was pretty disappointed with this.  Its way too small.  I am a medium, ordered a large, and it fits like a small.  I expected it to be flowy and open & that was the whole reason why I bought it.  Also, the rose has different colored threads through out the design and looks cheap.  However, the fabric is soft and cozy.  I was able to salvage it with cutting off the sleeves and neck to make it a tank top and we'll see if I actually wear it or give it to the Salvation Army."
3.0,What you can't see in the picture is that this shirt could be a dress! The collar also doesn't come down to where it shows.
3.0,"The purse is nice, but the material isn't the best quality for the price. As the other reviews mention, the interior is paper thin. The exterior, to me, doesn't look as nice as other faux leathers I've seen and own."
3.0,It helps  but not dark enough
3.0,I was expecting at least one of the circular lip rings but didn't recieve one. The rings were okay but they didn't really stand out to me. I wish I could have choosen the ones I wanted.
3.0,I ordered a Large in USA as suggested by the picture chart and i was sent a Medium USA/Large European but even then I think they should be labeled Small
3.0,Cute but turned green within a week :(
3.0,The gloves are very thick and warm. The problem is that the inner glove thumbs pull out slightly. When you pull the gloves on you have to align the thumbs before you can get the glove on all the way. It is just a minor inconvenience.
3.0,"Nice dress, but holds wrinkles easily and wrinkles were hard to iron out."
3.0,"Sizing varies between colors, although both pair I bought run small by about 2-4 inches"
3.0,"These were worth a try, as my ears are very sensitive to metals, but unfortunately, they add just enough thickness to my earring posts that I am not able to insert them into my ears."
3.0,"I am 5'9"" and typically wear size 12 or L in clothing.  I have a small waist compared to my wide hips, so typically, high waist clothing works great for me.  This skirt just missed the mark, and I'm so sad it did!  It unfortunately accentuated my wide hips and did not appear tight in the waist with the fabric being ruffled/thick in that area.  This would work best for non-curvy girls."
3.0,Very nice pins but the tree was broken-could not use clasp to close it
3.0,"I ordered these for summer, and while they look amazing when you open them, they are very boxy and stiff on. They doing flow very well and they have a very square look to them. The material is also very thin."
3.0,"Granddaughter wore these in school play.  They &#34;made&#34; her outfit as a Whooville girl.  By the end of the evening, however, they were cutting into her legs."
3.0,Really like them but they are too narrow. Do not want to stay on.
3.0,"The product is  good. It fits as expected. And I ordered it to see if it fits my style. But I wasn’t quite satisfied with the waistband so when I tried to return it, they didn’t accept it, and only refunded a part of it."
3.0,"Fabric content says, 65% cotton and 35% polyester which I'd wager is 100% incorrect. The gray body is at least 90% poly. The sleeves are most likely a poly nylon blend.<br />Pocket is flat sequins, not fish scale. Sleeves are a bit long. Overall fit is true to American size.<br />Despite the above it is cute and flattering, so I'll wear it when our weather hits the right temps."
3.0,"Love this Keychain. It is adorable. The light does not stay on unless you hold the button down, which is fine for me. I gave it 4 stars bc of that though.<br />I read some reviews that it is sticky - incorrect. It is Hollow though."
3.0,They look great but getting the noxious plastic smell of them (which gave me a headache while reading) takes some effort.
3.0,"It was a nice scarf, but not exactly what I was looking for. The fringe tickled a little more that I would have liked. I would have kept it but it was a little too expensive for me to keep it if I didn't love it."
3.0,"Prefer natural fibers, so a bit itchy. Not too fond of the current trend of artificial fibers/""cotton"" feel."
3.0,I ordered a small as Amazon suggested. It was skin tight. It appears it should be a bit looser than that. Love the quality though. Will need to exchange but won’t be for this Christmas 🤦🏻‍♀️
3.0,haven't really had a chance to try them yet but i think they will work fine i like my black one they're great.
3.0,"They are super cute, but the size is very  deceiving🤨"
3.0,I like the bag however in the picture the color appears more silver. This bag has a white background with a metallic overlay. The inside zipper  was off track upon receipt of the bag. Size is nice and durability in regards to fabric is great. I wouldn’t have purchased this bag if the true color was presented.
3.0,Haven't used them yet but seems well made. Helps that actually has pictures on the cubes that help you pack!
3.0,Quality is decent however they are too small. I wear a size 5
3.0,The face of the coin is barely cisible
3.0,After only 2 months the watch del apart and water filled up inside of it when I went swing.
3.0,Super cute boots. Not comfortable at all. Hardly any cushion. Feels pretty cheaply made material.  But they are cute!
3.0,It fit as expected but was not of a real high quality material.  It will probably function for what I need it for though.
3.0,Bought this for wife and she said that she would try them some time later after saying she wanted them so I don't know if they are going to be ok
3.0,Too small for me. I normally wear a 12 -14 and usually can fit a Large. But this Large was a little too tight. One size up would have been great.
3.0,It is fine to carry thing from day to day.
3.0,Overall decent socks. Unfortunately one of them came with a hole in it.
3.0,Not high quality but was a giveaway at daughter's b-day party.  All of the girls seem to like them.
3.0,"There is not a lot of elasticity, make sure to pay attention to the sizing."
3.0,"I liked this, it’s cute. Unfortunately, the tank was the only piece that was just too snug- due to its cut, for me to want to wear it.<br />I’m 5’7 average size with a 38D bust."
3.0,They do the job but I have sinus issues and often have a metallic smell in my nose from this jewelry so the quality is kind of questionable. I keep them clean and I’ve never had this issue with any other septum jewelry I’ve worn.  So far no irritation though
3.0,It’s honestly pretty cute just not the best material
3.0,"This band fit my standard men's Swatch properly, but it was nowhere near as durable as the original Swatch-made resin bands.  Bought it in 2011, and it finally fell apart just last week, so I'm in the market for a better rated version."
3.0,Color is way off of what it looks like in the picture.
3.0,It's pretty but constantly falls off my ear. I'll have to use something to help hold it on whenever I want o we're it.
3.0,"The cut of this top is weird and not very proportional. I sized up several sizes, but it’s just a little loose in the body. It’s a little short, but the sleeves are very long. It does not give me the slouchy look I was going for. I was hoping to like this enough to order a few colors, but nope."
3.0,"I have LOTS of OQQ products and I have always been a solid size medium… idk why I decided to order the small but it’s just a littttllleee bit to tight. It’s a nice color and cute cut but the fabric feels thin and it doesn’t pass the squat test. OQQ has better sets than this one, but I’ll keep it to lounge around in"
3.0,They were a little longer than I thought.
3.0,Sizes are very small and not the sizes Americans are used to.
3.0,Love the medallion but the chain broke 2 days after we got it.
3.0,Ok but slightly too small.
3.0,"(3.5 stars)<br />Very accurate fit.<br /><br />I would have given these five stars, but honestly, at a 10 MPH bike ride with a 15 MPH wind, I could feel a little wind through them.<br /><br />Not a lot, but the temperature was in the low 50s, and I shouldn't have felt anything through the gloves.<br /><br />It's not a lot of wind, but if you're expecting to use these below freezing, you're probably going to be disappointed if cold weather bothers you half as much as it does me.(that is to say, a LOT"
3.0,Not good quality and runs small
3.0,"This is huge. The druzy is pretty, but it doesn’t look legitimate. Looks kind of like it was painted with glitter."
3.0,The fabric feels comfortable but the shirt didn't fit me. The bat wing design is difficult to wear since you won't be able to move your arm freely without the shirt becomes un-tugged.
3.0,"This shoe/boot runs very large.  They are sized for men or women but actually that means that they are sized for men.  I wear a Womens size 8 but for boots I order 8W or 8.5.  Seeing these were sized for men or women I ordered the 8 and it was way too large even with very thick winter socks.  They run width comparable to a men D width.  The length of it was also much too large, I could have used a 7 and still been too much room.  Otherwise, it was well made, lining was not too thick, outer material definitely looked like plastic. If you are looking for particularly wide womens shoe or normal width men shoes then these might be a good option to try."
3.0,"Smaller than expected, would work for the lip and ears."
3.0,I can not tell you how to order these to fit.  I used a tape since I was not used to ordering in inches.  I am normally a 16.  I measured where I thought they would set and was 36&#34;.  When they got here there was close to 4&#34; extra in the waste.  Luckily I had a friend that they fit!  They really are cute.
3.0,Love the material feeling again my hand just wish that I have size up more since the waist band feel super tight when wearing it.
3.0,"Ordered this for my son. Although it looks good in the picture, it actually looks more effeminate on him. The neckline ran too wide."
3.0,"Fit a little loose, this causes them to pop out if you aren't careful.  Not bad for the money"
3.0,"Very full, extra fabric in the skirt.  The top fits true to size."
3.0,"It was a present for me, I like them so much, but after several times of wearing them I saw these cracks on the wrist. It looks like no leather... My brother have the watch if this brand with leather bracelet but it doesn't have any problems. Mine not looking good now. I am upset. I want refund."
3.0,"I really liked the dress and the fabric.  It fit well without being too tight or to loose.  I was concerned about the fabric stretching,  but I would have kept it if it had not been for the split in back.  It was too high.  Had to return it."
3.0,"It is stylish and I like the fact that it can be carried as a handbag, cross-body or converted to a back pack. Has lots of pockets and compartments. My biggest dislike is that all the hardware makes it somewhat heavy. With my things in there, this adds to the weight of it. Also for some reason it came with a weird smell, like it had been left it in a kitchen for a while and it soaked up some food smell. I've turned it inside out to air and sprayed febreeze on the lining which has helped to some degree. I'd probably give it 4 stars if not for the heaviness of the hardware."
3.0,"Seems to be of good quality and definitely dresses up my Apple Watch.<br />Edit…so my previous review still stands however, after trying to remove the links I decided to change the review some. The links are a pain in the ass to remove. The tool provided isn’t the greatest for the job. I say this as someone who worked in fine jewelry for 8 years and has removed links from hundreds of watches, every kind of watch from cheap $20 watches to watches that were thousands of dollars.  This band stands as one of the most challenging.<br /><br />Other than that this watch is lovely and I’m confident it’s will look great with my dress for my night on the town tonight."
3.0,Product is a little flimsy but I guess for the price you cannot complain. The logo is not very well made either.
3.0,"The prints is pretty but it has a bad confection. It's too tightat the crutch area and the breast part is asymetrical, meaning one side is wider leaving one breast completely exposed.  Im lucky my mom fixed it for me but she needed to opened it and stitch it back together. I would use caution when buying."
3.0,I understand this is costume jewelry but I certainly didn’t expect it to look as cheap and function just as badly.
3.0,Lovely shirt used the size chart the large is too big tried to return it but very complicated to do.  Figured I would give it away as a gift .  Then bought the medium and it was too small very sad.
3.0,Great quality. Runs bigger than expected. I got a size small and it was very loose on arms area and super long.
3.0,"Its a cute suit but honestly you may be disappointed if you have bigger chest. I am 36D and ended up getting XXL but side boob will be hard to cover, even with the pads removed. Nonetheless I will try to make this work and be extra careful when I am playing in the waves."
3.0,broke quick
3.0,"I didn’t understand that “cold shoulder” meant the arms are split from the shoulder to the wrist and there are long dangling ties after you tie it all up.  Not practical and not a good look.  Also, sizing chart had me buy a size that is way too big, but that’s secondary.  Returning."
3.0,Fits nicely but doesn't do the &#34;V&#34; in the back as much as the pictures make you believe it does.
3.0,"The straps wouldn't stay up, it was like the back was &#34;too open&#34;. It could use a strap across the back or a tie to help it stay up. Had to return."
3.0,"This bikini is cute but the bottoms are so tight. I ordered a large and they feel like smalls. I am 5'2, 145lb athletic build with a 36DD chest. The top is nice because you can adjust it as needed. Plain but cute. So I'll keep based on the top and give the bottoms away"
3.0,"The shorts are a weird cut, but I will still be wearing them a lot. The fabric is perfectly fine, and the shirt is nice. The shorts have to be rolled down or they look totally strange and don't feel the best. Worth it for the low cost, but not 4 or 5 star worthy."
3.0,These were stunning but the flares were too large! :(
3.0,I gave these to my 16 year old daughter for Christmas and she wore them one time and they turned her skin green and they turned brown after about 10 hours of wear which I realize has more to do with chemical makeup but they are a very cheap quality but looked beautiful on her fingers when she was wearing them. I realize they were only $13 but I just wish they would have lasted longer than one wear......but she absolutely loved them.
3.0,"Looks cheap, but she liked it. Thanks"
3.0,I Was Expecting This Product To Seem More Like The Picture.
3.0,The outfit did it’s justice for my toddler. The printed words Kept well in the washing machine but the cake icing didn’t come out of the onesie. I’ve used several products. Good thing it was only for her birthday. It was still a wonderfully made outfit. Thank you!
3.0,it was a slightly small
3.0,Great!! A must have
3.0,"The scarf, necklace, and glasses seem to be ok, but the wand is very cheaply made. It almost feels like it is made of paper machete."
3.0,The dress runs a little big so size down. it is also very long so you need to be either tall or wear with heels. The dress is elegant looking and has a unique appeal to it. I had to return the xl for a large
3.0,"I bought this for my wife for our anniversary and was initially impressed with the style, fabric, and stitching, but she never even got a chance to try it on. The first time unzipping it the zipper got stuck at the seam between the plaid and purple fabrics and one side of the zipper came completely out of the slide. I spent about 20 minutes trying in vain to get it back in before deciding to just return it. Apart from that, it seemed very well made. It was pretty obvious that the dress had already been opened and returned by someone else at least once, so hopefully that one was just a lemon that's out of circulation now."
3.0,"These are so comfortable, but they are SEE THRU!!!! The leggings are basically sheer tights, so I can only wear them around the house."
3.0,order at least 2 sizes up your pant size.  I wear a medium usually but I am a large Medium so I need some extra room. Pants are good and comfy.  I highly recommend for any hipster looking for comfy joggers.  It's good quality for the price.  I would not trust it to last more than one year.  Overall good buy
3.0,"Well I am not returning them, I found these Capri pants to be extremely uncomfortable. It’s almost like wearing neoprene. They are very hot in the summer and while the fit is good, the material makes them unwearable."
3.0,"These masked are fine. They are thicker so feel good in that sense, but they do muffle your voice and make it more difficult to understand what you are saying."
3.0,"Wish the bonus wallet is the same color as the purse as pictured, but instead I received a mismatched wallet color (black) as I ordered the brown color. Very disappointing. Purchased the purse because I thought I would get the same color bonus wallet. Very disappointing. Will return."
3.0,"Love the shape, hated the white color."
3.0,Looks as pictured. Has held up<br />So far. Is not very water resistant so anything it touches will get wet.
3.0,"While these are warm and soft the purple ( which Is why I ordered them) is definitely NOT PURPLE BUT MAROON. They are made with outside seams that you don't see in the picture They look like Long Johns. IF you are planning to ALWays<br />WEAR with something long over them they will be ok. Otherwise I would not recommend. They are very, very tight so the waist is NOT that comfortable."
3.0,"I ordered the 2-pack set of pink and purple sunglasses.  These are cute sunglasses but as you can see, they are not pink and purple.  More like orange and raspberry.  The price was great so I kept them.  They came in ziplock type bags inside a thin cardboard box with only one drawstring bag that doubles as a cleaning cloth.  They’re lightweight, fit well and do a fairly good job of keeping me from squinting!  I like the mirrored lenses.  They add a cute pop of color to my outfits.<br />UPDATE:  Received a postcard stating if I posted a 5 star review with picture they would send me a free pair of sunglasses.  How about sending me the color sunglasses I originally purchased.  I should knock a star off for that business practice but I will leave it at 3 stars because they are fun sunglasses."
3.0,Was disappointed that the clasps broke soon as put it on very poor chain!
3.0,"I read other reviews ,so I knew to allow for small size. I usually wear a 7 so ordered a 9 to be safe, or so I thought!I am sure I received a 6, as the line that distinguishes a  6 or 9 was  below the curve for a 6_. I would love them in the right size. May have ordered more in other colors!"
3.0,Not as long as I thought it'd be but still pretty good size. Looks very good with basically anything .
3.0,loved the fabric feel on it. very very fitted dress
3.0,Pretty Angel wing cuff earrings. Look like the pix. BUT the back is NOT a clip but a tiny screw that jewelers stopped using 50 yrs ago.  Doesn't hold tightly. I lost one the first day I wore it.
3.0,This ring WAS absolutely GORGEOUS! WAS!!!! All of the sudden I look at my daughter in law to be’s finger and the smaller stone is almost clear. Looks nothing like a moonstone and it didn’t look like that for quite sometime. I own tons of moonstone jewelry and I only buy the best. I know moonstones and their variations. Now it’s just past the time I can return. Buyer beware
3.0,Good fit. I am petite and XS fit well. The material is heavy and synthetic which made me feel hot and unventilated. Decent pants I wear to work as a chef.
3.0,"Ok so I have 3 of these.  They are all different material and fit.  I first got the gray one in size large.  Arms and chest are a lil tight but ok.  It is like t shirt material.  I ordered the white with black dots originally in size L as well.  It was huge.  Exchanged for a Medium.  Could still size down for a small and I’d like it better.  It is super cute tho!  Thicker, kinda waffley feeling stretchy fabric.  Today I got the tropical print one in a small.  Arms are tight and it has zero stretch.  This one is a blousey/thin dress shirt material and slightly see thru.  Keeping it though because it is SO cute and looks good on me.<br /><br />UPDATED AGAIN:  So I bought the plain black one.  Yet another material and cut.  I got a small.  It’s very long.  It’s like jersey material.  Extremely stretchy and feels cold.  Not what I was looking for.  So far the multicolor tie dye Is my favorite and so far the only one that is t-shirt material.  I ended up ordering polka dots in  small because it is a very cute sweet dress and more of a dress dress than the tie dye one."
3.0,The dress is nice but it didn't fit me. Size ordered was large. It would ride up in the front when I would walk  causing the opening to sit mid-thigh and it's see through. I'm not sure if it would ride up if it was a little looser.
3.0,Above
3.0,Too tight in chest area
3.0,I like the dress but it was too small
3.0,I had it for about three months and woke up to the ball getting lost. It was my favorite belly ring it worked pretty good I’m sad about it losing a ball.
3.0,They are too loose for regular or small size arms (of the glasses).
3.0,Super cute but all four chokers were bent and shoved in a tiny box I have them laying out straight on my heater hoping to unmorph them. Please don't shove them in a box that's too small.
3.0,Nice gym bag but bigger than what I wanted. Uncomfortable on my back if not full.
3.0,"These briefs are very soft and comfortable. They are softer and smoother than cotton, but also have a little more give. The design is of a  simple and streamlined brief."
3.0,Blue not as bright as picture.
3.0,"Very nice quality, fits as expected. If you like longer sleeves size up :)"
3.0,Material was a bit thin and it wasn’t flowy like pictured. It was a straight cut that didn’t work for me.
3.0,"Fit perfectly, and seemed like good quality.  After about 3 weeks stitching began to separate.  I say get another brand."
3.0,Little too small for me so I gifted it to a friend who really liked it.
3.0,I have a very small wrist and this is very tight!
3.0,working fine for my needs. one pair arrived with a side lense missing.
3.0,"I didn't like the pearl ones they were to big of a pearl, but I loved the clear ones."
3.0,"Nice design... love the sensation of an elastic material... But, the downside is they don't last long if you are rough on them."
3.0,To be honest I get men’s pants because I have long legs and am a hip hop teacher. These aren’t as long as I would like them to be. I was able to dance in them so that’s good. Material was a little stiff. It’s gonna take some washes to soften them up a bit. Not the worst joggers but I own better.
3.0,"Lenses are decent quality.  They advertised the blue non-polarized lenses, but I received polarized lenses.  OOWLIT says the only non-polarized lenses available are gold.  Apparently no verification of inventory."
3.0,The adjustment moves too easily for me. It loosens as I wear it through the day
3.0,Not the perfect quality but it depends on what you will use it
3.0,"My daughter loved these as soon as she got them. She wore them almost every day with no blisters while playing hard. But after about a month they started falling apart. I have superglued then back together but now (1.5 months after they came) the inside sole lining is peeling off and her toe has worn through the front of one shoe.<br /><br />If the plan is only to wear these to look cute, go for it. If they are meant to be worn for play, max life expectancy is 2 months."
3.0,I ordered a size 6 but it fits more like a 9.
3.0,Fabric hung strange.
3.0,Cute but too small I had to order a size up I wear large I had to order 2x
3.0,Thin<br />Cute<br />Small<br />Took forever<br />Would buy again if patient
3.0,"Purchased this ring for my son.  It's OK, looked cheaper in person than what you would expect."
3.0,REAL CHEAP! LOKS LIKE SOMETHING  you buy from a large bucket of random chineese made products<br />other than that it works
3.0,i had to return bc it was too tight on the bust area
3.0,Decent quality but that is expected at the price. Turned out to be harder that expected to adjust precisely; the adjustment points are notchy and if the adjustment point you want doesn't correspond with a notch it takes a lot of fiddling to get it in the exact position.
3.0,"It did not specify the color of the metal portion of the band in the description.  The photos look like gold, not rose gold. Seller needs to specify the metal color of the band in the description to avoid confusion for the buyer.  I would have preferred that it matched my watch face."
3.0,"Nice quality, comfortable. fits nicely however a little snug in the waist."
3.0,Run a little big. Only does a fair job at best of keeping my 16 month old granddaughter hands warm. If super cold or actually playing outside for more than 10-15 minutes I usually put 2 pairs on
3.0,"I normally wear large bottoms, these are a little snug. I know I have a bigger bottom but the coverage front vs back is a little funny. I have a lot of coverage in the front, and it comes up like a high wasited bottom, but the back side is short. Nothing bad, just different."
3.0,"They are kinda tight. If you have a big wrist, it would not fit your hand."
3.0,Smaller than I though but it will do.
3.0,Too small... Thought it would be a bit bigger
3.0,"I liked the colors that these came in and the price is much less than that of a Buff headband. They are multi-use, I mostly use them as head bands or bandanas or wrist wraps. The material is a bit flimsy and they are a bit stretchy with alot of give, so for my little head they are a little too big to wear as a bandana but as a headband it works OK...you just have to readjust throughout the day. Overall a good value though because one Buff costs about $20, so you get what you pay for but I recommend."
3.0,You need parts for mask
3.0,"I'm 5'8, 135-140 lbs and ordered the medium.  They were way too short in the torso, etc. so returning them.  Overall they were nice but just didn't fit."
3.0,I loved the color
3.0,The outfit was missing a little pink ball from the trim when it arrived. The fit is also smaller than expected. Material is nice and aoft and comfortable
3.0,"It does fit my adult head, but it is a little too snug, I could see some head pain becoming an issue. I wear a 7 1/4 size cap. I can take it off and immediately put it on my 6 year old son's head and it fits fine. Works good in the water, and dries quick. It seem to go back to its original size right away."
3.0,"I had received this from another source in a Large and it was too big, so I thought a Medium would work.  This is almost ok in size but not quite what I had wanted."
3.0,Little bit to small.
3.0,These shoes are super cute. The only thing I didn’t like is the gold hardware on the ties. It didn’t match the silver shine. I returned the shoe because after trying them on I could feel on the heel that the embellishments were sticky and slightly shiftable. That tells me at some point they will start moving or peeling off and that’s the part I don’t have time for.
3.0,"My daughter loves this costume. After one day, however, I had to re-sew the skirt and stop the nylon back from running. It's cute but poor quality."
3.0,It is a nice product and its price is a good choice
3.0,"a bit small, more show then quality however, still nice."
3.0,"There were weird little black things in the lace.  Like burn marks.  It took forever it seems to get here, however it did arrive as promised before the delivery date.  Seller was easy to contact and replied instantly.  I did have to have the dress altered which cost me $125.  The entire skirt has to be taken off and put back on because it was made weird.  All and all, my daughter looked beautiful in her last father daughter dance."
3.0,"These are nice, but the designs are not what is pictured. I specifically ordered these for a few really pretty designs, and of course, those were the ones not in the package. I’m disappointed."
3.0,"Nice size purse. My daughter lives it, but the chain broke off the first week she got it"
3.0,"Needed a replacement wrist band for my Misfit Shine 1.0. The old wristband was 3 years old and starting to pop open. The new bands arrived within a few days, even earlier than estimated. I've only tried one of the two bands I received. But the Shine fit in there nicely. I've been wearing it for several days already, no issues. Misfit doesn't seem to sell these bands anymore, so I was glad to find this.<br /><br />UPDATE: After several months (August to January?) of daily wear, my Shine started to occasionally pop out of the wristband. At first it only happened if I stretched the band, such as reaching that hand into a tight pocket. But now it occasionally pops out during seemingly normal use. Haven't lost my Shine yet, but starting to worry about that. Maybe I'll try the 2nd band from the pack to see if it's better. But it did work perfectly fine for the first few months."
3.0,Looked a little feminine.  Returned it.
3.0,Passable
3.0,"Does not have zip front closure as stated in description , did not come with free measuring tape either. Is a little tricky to fasten in the back. Am 34 DD and got in large size. The twisty detail bit in the front is giving me weird looking cleavage but I'll survive. Bought as bikini top, is padded so not too concerned about nipples showing through when its wet."
3.0,This is a pretty ring except it looks kind of cheap. I ve never received any compliments on it.
3.0,Doesn't fit the watch I have. Seems just fine other than that.
3.0,Not so nice but still very warm
3.0,The quality was not as good as other shirts I have ordered. It felt a little stiff and the neck felt funny. But i do like the colors.
3.0,"I ordered small and j got medium,supposed to get it in 2 days but took almost 5 days to get! It's pretty but hard to open and close it"
3.0,Item was on the small side.
3.0,"This thing is awesome - canvas was great because I didn't have to worry about any part of it. I used it as a gym bag so it mainly hung out in my car.<br /><br />The thing which attaches to the bag right next to the zipper that holds the D-ring to the bag has completely fallen apart though, so as to render it unusable without resewing that part back on.  I don't ever remember having more than about 8 lbs in the bag, so it came as a bit of a surprise.<br /><br />Before that, it was the perfect bag."
3.0,"Overall I like the paw, just a little big, I wish it was smaller."
3.0,Pretty decent kinda started to turn green and bronze color and it haven’t even been wet or anything
3.0,"It fits as expected; however, the tag is located at the most uncomfortable place at the bottom of my feet.  I have to remove it on each side so I can wear it comfortably.  Manufacture please relocate the tag somewhere else."
3.0,Loved it but fit a little short next time i will size up
3.0,Falls off in short time
3.0,"This has not yet been used since receiving it.  Though it looks and feels good, the very strong dye  smell  is offensive.  As a result it has been airing out since it was received."
3.0,I ordered two sizes up to a XXL. I usually wear a Large but I read some reviews that said bustier women need two sizes up. Glad I did. Also please be aware that the bottom white section of this dress is not completely opaque. You will need a slip of some sorts.
3.0,"Let me start by saying the hiking pants look amazing! I really like having pants with zippers-both sides- to secure personal items. Now, the disappointment- they are too small. So word to the wise, please order one size up to improve comfort in the crotch! Also, if you have large thighs- same advice-please order one size up to prevent a bad experience of what otherwise is a great spring thru fall apparel."
3.0,Not exactly the right color but they worked.
3.0,Love it but it is very difficult to put on and to take off and started to rust on my arm
3.0,"Nice looking pendant, but as with so much from China being small the chain fits my 5 year old with no chance of fitting an adult, which is a shame just a little longer and stronger [it is thin] and you've got a real nice cross pendant."
3.0,"This bracelet is really cute but super small. Instead of returning it, I gave it to a friend's little girl. It was perfect for her!"
3.0,Didn't care for the material and it was a little smaller than I wanted. Works as a layering shirt under my tshirts.
3.0,"The fit of this suit is great, but it has small gold stripes that I did not notice until it came in the mail that I did not like the look of."
3.0,"Fits well, very comfortable, the only issue I have with them is that after the first wear the toes are already starting to fall apart. I would not expect this after the first wear."
3.0,"I expected the material to make the fit more tight. At the top of my belly button area, the material loosens as you work out. Im usually a Medium and eith these pants I feel a size Small would have bit better."
3.0,It tasrnished quick
3.0,"I love the sweater, when it’s not on. It’s so cute on the model and the pics even on the bed when it’s laid out. But it doesn’t fit right throughout the shoulders, and makes it look like you’re a football player."
3.0,"The design is cute and the material is great! Yet for someone with small wrists, wearing it on the latch notch and having a bunch of excess band, looks kind of funny. I also don't like how the band comes undone from the actual watch; if I wasn't paying attention, I could've lost my watch!"
3.0,We purchased this as part of a treasure hunt and it served it's purpose but carrying it the first time to setup the leg fell off (which is held on with a nut) and then the elbow/forearm broke off.  It is a neat skeleton to use for a display but be very careful with transporting and any handling.
3.0,Good for the price just smaller in diameter then you think of.
3.0,Quality of material is not what I expected
3.0,I love the shirt is super cute and cozy but if your a big girl like me and you’re arms ar being then it’s going to be tight cause a third of the way down the sleeve for some dumb reason is a tight spot and a seem.. other than this it is comfortable.
3.0,Quality was good but size was waaay off. Large fits like a very tight medium.
3.0,PADS INSIDE DOESN'T FIT
3.0,bends super easily
3.0,"**Update**<br />My daughter wore the purple tank top today and I noticed a hole at the seam around the armpit. (See pic)<br /><br />I ordered size 5-7 for my (almost) 6-year-old daughter. Each tank had loose threads I needed to trim off, but the material is thick and seems to be good quality.<br />The picture with the pink tank top is before washing. It fits ok except that it is a little low/big in the armpit. The picture with the blue tank top is after washing. It fits better in the armpit but is a little tight in the torso.<br />Either way she loves them."
3.0,i bought this wax to do bullet wounds and knife slashes. it works fairley well although the wax is very stick so it gets all over your hands.
3.0,Too small and straps links fall off easily !!
3.0,"I absolutely fell in love with this suit when I saw it. I have a daughter that is on the modest side but works really hard to have a trim, toned body. I thought this would be the best combination for her since it has the coverage of a one piece with the appeal of a two piece bathing suit. When it arrived the suite is Beautiful, well constructed and a darling style. I had ordered an 8/10 but when the item arrived the bag said 2x. I hoped that it was just labeled incorrectly, but when she took the suit out of the package it was indeed a 2x even on the inside tag. We had to return it since it was just too large for her. We'd hoped to get the chance to get a smaller size but we were unable to get the follow up needed to re purchase in a smaller size.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"This is a beautiful pendant.  Unfortunately, the company engraves their name on the front of it, visible to everyone.  Returning."
3.0,I purchased my normal size but these are way bigger than that. Very oversized... if I walk in these they would fall to my feet.
3.0,The small was very large. More like a Medium. Arm length was very long too.
3.0,Too small. Hoops are only about 1 inch in diameter. Was looking for 3 inch diameter. Too bad. Throw away price and product. You get what you pay for.
3.0,Like but a little  bit  tight more reason to walk
3.0,"This product is to light weight for its intended purpose. Walls are thin and the hinges feel like they could give at any moment.  The hinges also double as carry handles, which is not a good design.<br />Would not buy again."
3.0,The Color was different from the picture.
3.0,It is a small fit for an XL
3.0,I broke em
3.0,I got this for my 2 year old to match mine. It's big. She will have to wear leggings and not shorts.
3.0,Doesn't fit like the picture portrays.
3.0,Fabric is not worth the price! Worth like $20 at most! Comfy but not that high waisted. Wish it had a drawstring
3.0,"Ordered it for my granddaughter's wedding. I should have NOT ordered a PLUS size.  A regular size would probably have fit better.<br /><br />However, the top was too long.  I thought it was  going to the top of my thigh,<br />instead the top length went to the top of my knee.  Not my style."
3.0,"Love the bag as it's large and you can see everything inside without digging. BUT, I used this ONCE and one of the big pockets already has a hole in the bottom. Super upset as I'm only day 1 of 7 into my beach vacation!!"
3.0,My feet are 8 1/2 &#34; long and these are tight on my feet.
3.0,Nice watchband but it was too big and very time consuming  to size it.
3.0,Its cheap and breaks to easy
3.0,I like the material but it's just a size smaller.
3.0,"Cheaper than I wanted, but i expected that based on the reviews. It was wearable for a few times.."
3.0,"The cut and fit of this dress is nice; however, the material is not."
3.0,Its not as roomy as i had hoped but its ok
3.0,It's like tugging on a really tight scuba suit with narrow straps that dig into your shoulders. It does what it says for that special dress or occasion but u comfortable for the every day all day long.
3.0,"The brushes are just a bit stiff and the polish applicator feels like it will separate from the handle if you press too hard. Other than that, it is a good travel kit."
3.0,Smaller then excited
3.0,"Very colorful and lightweight material, but not as roomy as needed. More like a &#34;one-size fits most&#34; type of product"
3.0,A lot of the hair falls out
3.0,"Cosmetic degradation started in weeks.<br />Belt lasted 6 to 7 months then the ""leather""  broke and became unusable."
3.0,It is a good size and I like it but the color is more coral than pink.
3.0,"A thin fleece material, lack of accessories details in tailoring, looks as very low priced for poor people"
3.0,Roses aren't as visible as pictured
3.0,The side of the shoe separated from the sole after the second wear.
3.0,"It was great for a couple days, but it feel apart not long after I got it. I was disappointed because it was beautiful."
3.0,I bought this for my child to use and it is very hard to open fully.
3.0,Both necklaces are very cute but the one with white “pearls” arrived broken and the material also looks so cheap. I tried to fix it and I might only wear it once or twice but honestly I feel like if I pull it hard it’ll all break apart. The other one with the clouds and angels was cute and functional and that’s the only reason why I’m giving a 3/5 review.
3.0,"Very cute but runs small at the top, so it rides up even when it’s tied."
3.0,"The dress was super cute. The material is a bit thin, but not see through; however, I would suggest wearing a slip any way.<br />It seems to be more high waisted. I'm 5'2&#34; and the length of the dress comes to my knees. For me that is perfect. However, the chest is too small, and I am a 34B. And unfortunately, I had to return. Overall: cute, size up."
3.0,"This is super comfy and versatile, but after wearing once with a cross body leather purse with leather strap, the fabric balled up everywhere the purse touched."
3.0,Love this jacket it's just a little tight on the arms. So if you have thick arms go up a size
3.0,Costumes were OK size wise. The dress is stretchy but is a bit of a tight fit for those with a large chest. Dress was also very wrinkled but can be steamed easily. Tooth came out of the package with black stains on it but came out after washing with oxiclean. Gems came right off of crown but can be re-glued on.
3.0,Got a 2XL but it fits like a medium. It looks nice but runs way too small
3.0,Baby wore it on first time it rip while taking photoshoot
3.0,"Material is super soft and comfortable. However, it’s really thin and didn’t keep me warm. I would not recommended."
3.0,"Like the overall size as it isn't oversized. Inside pockets are too small for my liking.  Smartphones (I have a Galaxy 5) will not fit inside, but will fit in outside pocket, which does zip.  Reading glass barely fit because of pockets not being deep enough.  Top zipper seems a bit &#34;rough&#34; at times.<br />Overall, a good product."
3.0,"Nice set, but I have small fingers.  Description says they fit size 5-8.  Two of my favorites don't even fit my largest finger.  Disappointed with the size variation.  The other 4 fit fine."
3.0,"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. However, it fit a little to small across the breast area while the lower half was an exact fit. I am slightly disappointed but I will still attempt to wear it at least once because it's actually that cute."
3.0,Very pretty and comfy however i dont think its stainless steal because after leaving them overnight on my wet bathroom counter caused eroding
3.0,This product needs-TLC had to put a piece back broke on the way out of the package.-
3.0,A bit disappointed. After reading the reviews most people suggested ordering at least one size up what you would normally buy. I normally wear and large so I ordered an xl. It's too big. I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 155lbs. Wish I would have went ahead and ordered my normal large. This xl is baggy everywhere. Guess I'll see if I can find someone that can take it in for me since I don't want to deal with shipping it back.
3.0,"Size, shape, and style we're perfect, just as described. However, the orange color was a little bit more brighter than expected. Almost like a fluorescent orange."
3.0,it is really hard to get the band off.
3.0,I’m normally a medium and they were too tight around my legs and didn’t really fit like the picture :/ also I got the white and they were very see through so have to return
3.0,The pin was like the one I was looking for but way smaller.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:e3990b6a6649ed3141243187525d72bd]] This case looks classy.  It is a hard plastic case with a paper thin layer of leather glued on the outside.  It looks durable but I would think the leather stickers might come off after some time.  The one thing I don’t like about this case is the double hinges (original case plus this case) make it harder to open the thing. It has the effect of pulling the AirPod Case up whenever I open the lid.  It does look nice.  ** NOTE:  I received this item in exchange for an honest review based on my own experience with it.
3.0,"Not for big boobs since it's already short, becomes even shorter."
3.0,I wish the words were easier to read. The black on the letters has worn off very soon and so hard to read.
3.0,Fraying already after 1 month
3.0,"I wear a size 16, therefore I purchased a size XXL, I haven't seen such small clothing since my 26 year old was a young child. The size looks like a size 4.  Although the fabric is vintage looking it is stunning--These items are exceptionally small...... DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE FULL FIGURED-these pajamas are for only XXS and small...."
3.0,They are not like the purple I ordered a couple of months ago.. I have a small Narrow feet and they stretch when I watched him the first time.. I have tripped several of times..
3.0,The material wasn’t the best on this dress. It didn’t look right on me and runs big.
3.0,"These sunglasses from Skyway made a statement.  Granted, I am not quite sure what the statement might be, but they certainly said something about the wearer.<br /><br />My lady had hoped the glasses would have a 1970s vibe while giving a more updated, current look.  Unfortunately, they appeared to be a rather cheap knockoff from the 1970s: the glasses seemed more suitable for a costume party than everyday wear.<br /><br />The lightweight frames felt fragile, such they would never survive a drop or accidentally sitting on them.  The soft case did not help, as it offered no protection beyond the prevention of surface scratches.  I wouldn't try adjusting the nose pads or legs for a better fit, as they would probably snap off!<br /><br />Despite a reasonably low price, I don't think the quality and overall appearance justify even that price.  I would look elsewhere if seeking a pair of retro, oversized sunglasses."
3.0,This is a very cute purse but unfortunately it’s not real leather. The quality is fair in terms of sturdiness. The small zipper a top of the bag is flimsy and difficult to open. I don’t know if I would buy from Betsy Again!
3.0,XL still doesn't fit right and I am a large.
3.0,"Fit well over stomachs and hips well but barely covered the nips on my only size c boobs. It's lingerie so it might not matter to some but it just looked like it was pulling hard to cover them and I didn't like it. Pretty color, going to try something else."
3.0,Bra is comfortable and light. Slightly scratchy lace.
3.0,Not made for 5-9 tall ladies. The bottom was mid calf. Thick material. I weighed 241 got 2x. Did not have any curve around lower back. Cape was wayy to short.
3.0,"The chain itself is very pretty and flattering. It accentuate the neck and make any outfit elegant. My only issue is that it is not true to length. Instead of being 18”, it’s actually 17” which is disappointing."
3.0,Get your scissors ready to cut off and tie up all the loose ends.
3.0,"kinda cheap feeling material, not sweatshirt, like I expected. ordered xlarge, more like a large.  Wrinkles so not cotton"
3.0,"Look good, but, not Polarized.  Had more glare from sun when I put them on.  For the price, didn't really expect them to be Polarized."
3.0,Good shorts but there not worth the price.
3.0,Little bit too big but other than that it was nice need to make it a little bit more smaller
3.0,I have a tie dye and black version of this dress and they are soft and stretchy. When I got this blue and white patterned one I was very disappointed. It was not the same material and had no give which made it so it didnt fit me. It's not a bad dress just not consistent with the others and the material was the reason I likes them so much.
3.0,"looks like i am wearing  a blanket, material too heavy not as flowy as i thought"
3.0,"The keychain seems to be pretty solid. I've had it a couple months now, my only gripe is the design. The loop is very narrow and short, which sometimes make clipping it on my belt loop difficult, especially when I'm carrying something and have to do it with one hand."
3.0,The sleeves were to small. Material was not thick like a sweatshirt.
3.0,So adorable but the skirt that came with it was way too big for a 6-9 month size
3.0,These are rather cheaply made; the snap attachments are very flimsy; I have already taken them off with a seam ripper and attached my own elastic with velcro tabs - much more secure this way.  They do get the job done so you don't have to worry about cleavage while at work.  I fold the lace portion down so the lace appears attached to the panel - looks a little neater that way.  Not bad for the price.
3.0,"Not an expensive piece of jewelry so I didn't expect it to look expensive.  It is pretty enough, however, especially for the price."
3.0,Pros<br />Has a conventional watchband buckle which stays connected - unlike the post and hole stock band<br /><br />Cons<br />The band only lasted 2 months of daily use before the plastic fitting connecting to the Fitbit broke (see picture)
3.0,"compare to price, it is OKAY"
3.0,"To long. Didn't return. Tied a knot and cut off length. They are stretchy and shoe fits good.  Size 6 , 5 eyelet ugg tennis shoe."
3.0,Cute but fell apart quickly
3.0,"I love this necklace. It looks great! However, it broke the second time I wore it."
3.0,"I loved the frames and the feel of the glasses, but I couldn't get over the lenses not being clear. There were almost lines on the lenses that were from poor manufacturing that when driving or riding my bike would make my eyes strain. I would pay more for these if the lenses were better."
3.0,"The dress has a funny smell even after washing it, it still smells weird. Otherwise, I like it."
3.0,Not what I expected. Cheap quality.
3.0,A bit disappointed as I selected this one due to the color selection. I did not get any of the darker colors or the lime green/purple/dark blue. Everything was pastel.<br /><br />Other than that get a lot for the price and the key ring is pretty much good quality.
3.0,The dress itself is lovely. The pattern is very pretty. I am 8-10 and bought large but it's snug. I'll have to wear it to socialise as opposed to work which was the original intention.
3.0,Pretty dress but it is much shorter than it appears in the photo.
3.0,"I ordered two of these, for a 9 and 4 year old. They are beautiful and acceptably made. I did notice that after just a couple wears and one wash that little elastic strings were starting to break apart on the sleeve and neckline area. But my biggest complaint is that these are completely backless. Makes it cold for little ones and hard for preteens with bras to pull off. I ended up sewing a white shirt inside them to cover the sheer part."
3.0,"Im satisfied with the size of the bag, however the sewing quality of the seams are terrible. Upon opening the package, one of threads were already unraveled, leaving a seam of the bag open. I wouldve returned it, but I needed it for work the next day. Now more seams are coming apart due to actually putting items in the bag. Hopefully I can repair the seams and continue using the bag."
3.0,I usually straddle the large to extra large size.  I ordered an XL so that I could layer underneath. It was longer  and bigger than I expected. I would order a large next time.  And the zipper is on the wrong side for Americans.  Quality looks great otherwise and it's very warm.
3.0,no engancha bien
3.0,"These were cute, patriotic and love the lax sticks but WAAAAY too pricey for what we received.  They were thinner than expected and felt and looked cheap.  Disappointed in quality for the exorbitant cost!"
3.0,Like these but they are heavier than anticipated
3.0,"The product was exactly how it looks in the picture, just was a little too tight which made it a bit difficult to breathe."
3.0,"First off these earrings come in the coolest packaging, it’s easy to open and keeps the air out.<br /><br />They are larger (wider)  than I expected, if you can see my photo—-if you have two piercings you might only be able to wear this pair alone.<br /><br />They are hollow but still seem heavier than most of my earrings.<br /><br />The silver tone is darker in these, more like a stainless look.<br /><br />They are different earrings and for the earring collector these will be a find."
3.0,"I usually buy S sizes, but this time i bought M and it fits. Only one thing almost made me want to returned it. I can not put my hand in left pocket because of the button is sewn on through..."
3.0,Wears down after a few weeks
3.0,More of a T-shirt in quality and feel than the image depicts
3.0,"Runs quite big throughout, it was super super long, I had it hemmed and took off like 6 inches. The straps are also uncomfortable."
3.0,Nice. Ordered gift wrapping and seller did not gift wrap.
3.0,I love it. I just wish there was a better way to secure it on my wrist.
3.0,It's great for the price but I'm used to the right side and it's made for the left side but all and all its great
3.0,"A little bit large, costumey and great for Halloween, but really won't get any other use for it.  Thats about it."
3.0,Good material but he stitching of the logo is not so good quality
3.0,"Love the material and style, but it was a little short for me."
3.0,I ordered this on prime wardrobe and really wanted to like it but it just wasn't my style. Fit well though and seemed like solid quality.
3.0,"Cute top, but the sleeves are waaaay too long. Like, 6 inches too long. Whose torso is like this?"
3.0,"The feel and texture is nice, but runs small."
3.0,I brought these to use for my cousin's candy buffet table but I did not use them. They are okay but my glass jars were to heavy for them.
3.0,"Needs better link mechanism. This product is very cute, sentimental, and keepsake worthy, but the link that keeps it on the key chain kept opening up and my son almost lost his and his girlfriend lost hers.  She liked it do much he ordered a new one and just incase he<br />loses his too."
3.0,Very pretty but material is very thin
3.0,"Sizing was right, but the top of the ring is so heavy, it inevitably slides around between your fingers. I'll more than likely turn it into a necklace and wear it that way. Very pretty ring though"
3.0,I purchased this necklace because my Mother died unexpectedly recently.  I wanted a heart shaped necklace to put a photo of my Mom on one side and me as a little girl on the other looking at each other.  There was no way to do this without ruining the photos.  there was no backing or anything to raise the photos up or protect them.  I had to take necklace and photos to a jeweler and have them put something in to raise photos and a clear cover.  But he said the same thing.  Usually there is a raised backing to support photo.  I love the inscription on necklace.  It is a very pretty piece of jewelry.  I purchased this from AMAZON AND IT CAME QUICKLY.
3.0,"Nice and warm, real wool, stictching is decent...but slippery...so remember that for driving, etc..."
3.0,Easy enough to repair but I don't expect to have to mend an item out of the bag. Won't purchase again.
3.0,"Other reviewers said it ran small so I sized up. It was like a tent. Plus the material was very heavy. Overall, too bulky for me."
3.0,It was not exactly what I thought it would be.  Flimsy fabric.
3.0,Live in Arizona need to be darker.
3.0,Watch dial face is very large and the band is very stiff.  No what I expected.
3.0,"For the price, it's totally fine. It's not that heavy. It's a great size, easily fits everything I need, with a nice wide zipper opening. But the vegan leather is SUPER shiny and looks quite fake, which cheapens the overall style a bit."
3.0,Had to return due to metal sensitivity.
3.0,"This could have been a really cute dress if it were about 5&#34; longer.  I took note of the length prior to purchasing, measured on myself how long it would be and decided it was worth a shot.  But it was much shorter when I tried it on.  Definitely not appropriate to wear to a graduation, as I had intended.  It is much closer to tunic length than a short dress and my husband commented that it looked much more like lingerie than a dress because of the length.  If you are looking for a very short dress (or to wear this with leggings), the overall sizing was about right.  I am 5'6&#34;, 118lbs and ordered a size small. It was very flowy, not fitted at all.  The neckline and racerback were very nice."
3.0,"Ordered a large (which is usually too big for me), but it was very tight and I had to return it."
3.0,The T shirt was a little shorter than looks in the picture! It's a gift so hoping it will be ok!
3.0,I like them I just feel they’re a bit overpriced to be honest
3.0,It's pretty but it flips up constantly.  It looks bad and is annoying.
3.0,"I bought this shirt for a long weekend to New Orleans for my 30th birthday. I tried on the shirt and didn't love the way it fit on me. It could just be my body type, though. It was fine, but wasn't anything that thrilled me."
3.0,I absolutely love the ring but it is really made for a little girl. It’s beautiful but so dainty and I don’t have big fingers. I will wear it on my pinky. It’s really very pretty.
3.0,The LARGE size make me feel like I'm wearing jewelry that little girls use to play Princess. Almost toy like. Fast shippinf and nicely packaged.
3.0,"Great Winter socks. I purchased these to get some additional winter socks during these colder temps that have hit the mid-west. I go thru socks quite often so I wanted to try this Hapyfost ones out. I have worn these socks for a week and wanted to list a few things I liked and disliked about the socks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Socks are just the right length. (For winter socks and boot wearing shoes these are the perfect length)<br />- Color Scheme is great. (The logo is on the sole of the sock and non obtrusive as some manufactures)<br />- Comfortable to wear with a time limit (See Cons for explanation)<br />- Sock cushioning is good. (The cushioning from toe to heel definitely helps when constantly in motion, or when I need to walk extended periods at a time.)<br />- Sock Fit (Sock fits my 10-11 Size foot without issue.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Socks are comfortable yet tend to over-heat your feet to make them sweat. When this happens you tend to see the quality of the sock and how well its made. It forms little lint balls or cotton remains. The inner part of the sock is soft and comfortable but I would prefer it to not &#34;shed&#34; the fibers after wearing it all day.<br /> - Medium to Medium Heavy weight A bit on the thicker side for dress shoes. ( I still wear them to the office either wearing the socks in a loafer style shoe or dress shoe and it works for me.)"
3.0,"Looks cool on the outside but is super cheap once you open it. But on the other hand with the low price, I wasn't expecting a high quality. I would say if you're buying this because you like the look of it, go for it. But if you're buying it for a working piece that you'll actually use for keeping time, pass on the purchase."
3.0,I like the dress; I dont love it.  I ordered a large but this was super large...i definitely have to get it altered...the top of the dress is an extremely large fit.
3.0,It's a tiny earring. Pretty but tiny
3.0,I do not recommend these for shorter people. The waistband (which wasn’t as thick as the one in the picture) went up to my bra line making the scrunched up part sit on the middle of my back instead of my butt and the length of the legs were way too long for me.
3.0,I ordered 2 sizes up and they were still tight.
3.0,I love this dress and it was really comfortable but it started pilling after 2 washes.
3.0,"The silver charms on this bracelet arrived badly tarnished.  I had to spend some time cleaning them, and then wiping the tarnish off the leather.  I'm glad that I did not send this directly to the gift recipient, as it would not have made a good first impression."
3.0,They are tight to put on feet when starting. Have to do some considerable wrangling to get them over ankles but once past there they are fairly easy to fit. Comfortable once you get used to them. I not so happy about wearing them but Doctor highly recommends.
3.0,Just too big. I’m a 5’11” man (slightly above average in size). These caps are too tall and too wide. I don’t understand who they are designed for as I would imagine they do not properly fit the majority of customers...
3.0,I am happy overall but the stitching could have been better. And I am not sure if it will last for<br />Long or not
3.0,This hat is very large
3.0,Description is too simple to describe this material. Not in detail. But it is a cute dress. Just a bit larger.
3.0,"My 10-year-old daughter loves this style of no-tie shoe for the convenience. While we originally purchased them as running shoes, they’ve since become her everyday favorite.<br /><br />These shoes are prone to elastic breaks, as reviewers across the internet can tell you. In most cases, the shoes must be disposed of once the elastic breaks, as there’s no way to tighten or secure the shoe to the child’s foot.<br /><br />We have owned a few pair of these shoes now, and have only had the elastic laces break once. In our case, I was able to tie the two broken ends of elastic back together and tuck the knot into the side of the shoe, allowing us a few more months of use from the shoe.<br /><br />Overall, my daughter loves these shoes, but I wish the elastic was a bit more durable - especially for a product marketed towards active kids."
3.0,"Someone definitely needs to go through and recheck the sizing of all these because wow… That size difference between all the pairs was crazy. One pair was smaller than a 2g, another pair bigger than a 00g. Pairs were mismatched in size, too. Some of the pieces weren’t polished enough and had rough spots, some just looked really dingy and cheap."
3.0,It is too pink !! The light peach color that was shown in the picture that I liked was totally different from the ones they sent.
3.0,"I lover the brown color and quality of these glasses, however, they look too big on me. If you have a round or larger face thaN these may work for you! I'm going to make mine sunglasses."
3.0,"It’s a perfect fit but,the issue is the jean quality is not as good...!!"
3.0,"Love the colors, so much fun. But unfortunately they really don't fit the way they should."
3.0,The pics hide the fact that there’s no thumbs. They are incredibly soft and awesome otherwise and I still and happy with them.
3.0,Well...you get what you pay for!  It's really cute with a place for everything.  Lasted about 1 month.  Just went to open the snap and it ripped from the material.
3.0,Little tight needs to be a matching set.
3.0,Won’t stay latched
3.0,Nice but very thick.
3.0,I like the design of it. Kind of wish it was a little bit longer and bigger. Will try to work into the fit. Great product as far as production and quality but poorly designed in the croch/ vagina area! It's ridiculous how tight this garment is the vagina! I would like to send it back!
3.0,Not for larger busted women. Ties could be longer and made of a plasticy material. Does it's job.
3.0,The material is cheap rayon and the hair bow is just a long tie so kinda useless. The tassels are super cute on the onesie.
3.0,Stitching is horrible but capris are stretchy & comfy.
3.0,Love the hoody itself but the sizes run small. I normally wear a large but it fits like a medium so I’ll have to return it and buy the bigger size.
3.0,will keep the bottoms and give the top to someone smaller
3.0,"I’m a large with not too wide hips but this skirt was a bit tight and short , I’m 5’2"
3.0,"I was really excited for this piece. but as i opened it a crystal flew off. so the peacock has less feathers. anyway, i still tried it on. a little small for my ear. so I did return it. I would think it'd be a little sturdier for what i paid."
3.0,seam hit right on chest area...
3.0,It was ok. Smaller than I expected
3.0,This material was more flexible like jersey knit.  Decided on another dress.
3.0,"A great ides,  great design, BUT, the AirTag has a tendency to pop out of the holder!"
3.0,"I can't fault the seller. I went over the description and sure enough, the measurements are there. The picture is a little misleading, though. These earrings are ridiculously tiny. They're pretty, but if you're looking for something to dangle past your chin line - look elsewhere."
3.0,"Super cheap, but a fun design. Doesn't do much for eye protection but great for style and fashion."
3.0,"It really is a lovely dress. The only problem is, my daughter selected the blue dress and received a black one. There is no flower either. She is only 3 and there's a beautiful dress here, so she's happy either way. It's a little disheartening that the black dress we have is only $9.99, but we paid $15.99 for a blue one. If you get what you pay for, it's a 5 star dress. I'm taking one away for the lack of flower and another for the wrong color and paying too much."
3.0,"A little uneven, but for the price I'm satisfied."
3.0,I ordered an XL for a friend as a gift but I was expecting it to be long it looked a bit short and it was not as big as I thought it would be. The image on the shirt looked poor it didn't look like a high quality print.<br /> I might return it.
3.0,The color and material are great. Fit up top isn't bad but at the waist is more like an XL than a large. Front and back are way too wide for a size large. If it wasn't for that this shirt would be 5 stars. I love this brand and they're other shirts but not this one.
3.0,The design I pick was too low
3.0,Kinda flashy for me will look better on a taller women
3.0,Just like other reviews stated... Runs small material is very thin and the length is short short. I like the style n will wear as a top with leggings
3.0,"Shrunk the first time I washed it. Now it's like a push up bra without pads, which is not what I wanted. Otherwise it's a cute bra!"
3.0,Cute but not meant for shorter people. Would work better on someone with a longer torso.
3.0,"Top is not really a “sweater” nor is the fabric regular “sweatshirt”/pullover material. I expected it to be too good to be true, so I was not surprised to find that it is not really workable. It is very short, and very wide. Screen print style legging fabric isn’t the look a woman of my age really digs into wearing. It would be super for some kind of costume. But for the price? Not a happy camper. The design of this top could be really well done, but this is like the knock-off version of what it should be. I apologize for speaking so bluntly, but had I read a review that said this, it may have saved me the cash AND the extended ship time."
3.0,This was an awesome shirt but it was too tight and seemed quite small for tie size that I ordered.
3.0,"The crown is cute and a decent quality. It’s made of a flexible material, so it has the possibility to bend and look a little folded. The staff though did not last at all. The topper on it came apart within a couple of days of play."
3.0,pants run small
3.0,Band is too small; will need to get a bigger one if I start to wear it
3.0,The dress is not actually red it’s more of a purple red. if you don’t mind that it’s cute! My dress has the slashes i got a size XL and it was only a tad bit tight on the arms
3.0,"Good alignment of prisms, and fit over glasses well.  Nose rest not comfortable, and must carry a heavy set of prisms.  So use laying on back not so good."
3.0,"They are what they look like. Thin tabi socks.<br /><br />So, for us westerner, let's be clear about what we're getting differently here: obviously, the big toe is split, but these socks don't have a sewn cup for your heel. You'll stretch them permanently into shape on the first wear, and it means no matter what these things ride low in the back.<br /><br />These are thin. I'm a size 10.5, right at the top end of what these products are claimed to fit. Looks like I have pantyhose on my feet, and holes wear into them within the first 2 wears and washes.<br /><br />If you have small feet, if you live in a warm climate, if you want to wear these socks around the house, they're probably for you. Just know you can get tabi socks with the &#34;hanes white cotton sock&#34; construction we're all used to if you keep looking."
3.0,"nice, got it for my pastor Christmas gift."
3.0,"Chipped in several spots, definitely alot bigger than shown. No 925 stamp. Very cheap and poorly made. Dollar Store could have done better"
3.0,i liked that it heated up kept me warm while i unloaded a truck in the middle of winter but when the next winter came it wouldnt lite up and i followed the instruction as well what a waste of money
3.0,Looks great just wish it was made of better materials.
3.0,"I’m not sure whose fault it is here. The hat was shoved into the box and now doesn’t lay flat..the color is more of an orange than red but the picture pretty well described it. I’m going to do my best to flatten it out because it is very cute. Got a medium, I wouldn’t say I have a large head...?....most hats fit me with no problem."
3.0,"Too long on my 5'2&#34; self..  Almost to my ankles. I will be returning it. Ordered XL, 48&#34; bust and it fit well except the length."
3.0,Expensive!
3.0,The style was great but the fit of the short are too tight.  I brought a 40 waist and my husband is 38 waist.
3.0,The shirt is nice. I like it but it’s more of a royal blue color then the image
3.0,"Not as pictured. Very cheap fabric, almost see thru. Shipping as"
3.0,"So I'm  5'6  185 and I ordered an X- large and this fit like a Med on me, which is way too small"
3.0,"I am returning them because the strap on one of the shoes is too large and can't be adjusted.  I like the shoe and the color, everything else was fine."
3.0,Cute but too much padding.
3.0,The ring it’s self is pretty but the packaging was not pretty at all. I received it in an old plastic small bag. It also took weeks to receive it.
3.0,Super thin fabric. I thought it would be thicker cotton like material. Its almost like the lining of a slack material.<br /><br />They also fit on the smaller side. I'm medium on regular joggers. These have buttons and no stretch in the waist...so go a size bigger.<br /><br />They also sent me the wrong size for the khaki. 3xl...hello????
3.0,It was just a bit to big and long on me
3.0,"I ordered this because my husband who is a US Army recruiter now, it was a gift for his 18 years of service in the Army. I chose this jacket because it is advertised as having fleece and being reversible. He has days where he has to dress casual so I try to get him shirts and such with the Army logo for those days. Well what we received is a very nice jacket and fits perfectly, but it is just a windbreaker. It does not have fleece and there is no way it is reversible. He likes this jacket as it will work for the cooler but not cold days, so we will keep this one, but I want to know how to get the fleece lined reversible jacket also. I paid for the fleece lined but just received the windbreaker. I’m not sure how to reach out to the company as I want to get the other one, but I am worried if I order again I will receive this one again. He does not need 2 windbreakers, he needs a thicker jacket. As I said what we received is nice, but not what we paid for or what we ordered."
3.0,Does not support as well as others I have used. Am disappointed.
3.0,"The only things the item I received have in common with the item I ordered is the color and the silhouette. There is a single flower on the waist, no bow, no embroidered overlay, just the same burgundy fabric top to bottom. It fits, and it’s cute, but it is NOT what I ordered."
3.0,Would be great to add some traction on bottom
3.0,I bought this in August. It fits great and pulls in everything. I do not like how the bra straps cut into my armpits. It's very painful.<br />Also I just pulled it from the washer and the strap has broken completely off of the garment.<br />I hope I can exchange it.
3.0,I had to return this jacket because the zipper would not come apart at the bottom.  Otherwise the fit and weight was OK.  Can't speak to the durability or permeability as I did not keep
3.0,"This product fits amazing and looks really cute but you it’s stains very easily (with perfume), you have to hand wash and dry and is basically see through."
3.0,This outfit has a zipper crotch and the zipper was so short it did not even fit over my 6 month olds head. I ordered the 18-24 month size! It also does not fit like the picture at all but I was expecting that from other reviews. I can sew so I was able to put a new zipper in but that probably isn't an option for a lot of people. The legs are very snug and the body of the outfit is pretty short. It is still cute on but had I not replaced the zipper I woudn't have been able to even get it on my son. I say that it fits him well but if I had ordered the 6-12 month size it would have been way too small for my chunky baby.
3.0,Quality is pretty good for the cost. I would recommend going down a size if you are smaller chested.
3.0,Really red the waist band fits under the bust making it fit as a baby doll or maternity 👗
3.0,These socks are extremely thin and don't keep your feet warm. You can see through the material.
3.0,ah nothing to rave about. Kind of cheap material. Not so flattering.
3.0,Glasses are a bit wide.
3.0,"I ordered the L/XL like I have from a few years ago....This one doesn't seem quite as big. I truthfully don't have a large head. I like to use after swimming in the colder weather. My hair is typically in a bun after swimming.  The other one covered my ears, but not this one....I feel like they adjusted their sizes...like the other size better...so did my ears :>"
3.0,It fulfill the purporse
3.0,It's shorter than I expected.
3.0,"The rubber nose is difficult to keep in place and scratchy. Plus, there was an odor. But, removing the nose, kids had fun with the glasses."
3.0,"elastic waist not very well made and gets twisted around,"
3.0,"The clips are hair clips, the tie it self is pretty cheap to the touch, but not bad, the price for all this, no, just no."
3.0,"Nice, but much bigger than expected."
3.0,Returned<br />Nice but not what I thought it would be.
3.0,It’s comfortable but not as long as in the picture. I’m 5’3” and this barely passes my waist.
3.0,"In the product picture it shows a stylus pen, which I did not receive. The case itself works fine, it is a pretty blue. Bulky to use while talking on the phone though."
3.0,Not what I expected. They’ll be either used for lounging at home or given away.
3.0,"Nice top, but runs at least a size too small."
3.0,I love how safe I feel in these masks. I just wish some of the ear loops didn’t rip so easily.
3.0,This was a nice color but it was a little on the big side. I ordered a M and it was bigger then my liking!
3.0,Cute style. Fabric is rather thin so be aware you will need a slip. This runs at LEAST two sizes small!! I normally wear between a sm/med and ordered an XL bc I wanted a loose fit. This is still clingy on me! 5’3” 126
3.0,These shoes fit well but didn't take long before falling apart but for the low price I was expecting that.
3.0,"It really is just OK. I do recommend ordering a size up, as suggested by other reviewers, and I strongly urge you to check all of the seams for rips or holes, or even just being unfinished, as soon as you open it. I got it on a Friday and opened it to use on Saturday, and while I was steaming the wrinkles and creases out, I found a hole in a seam under the arm. This is exactly why I try to only purchase Prime items with Free Returns, so I will be able to get my money back.<br /><br />I also noticed that there is no split on the sides, like the one pictured on the model, so it doesn't flow like it should, either. Purchase at your own risk :/"
3.0,Nice for Spring weather
3.0,"I would not order this unless you are a size 8 or smaller.  The back cross section is good with the elastic in it, but only measure 4"".  If you have any chest/bosom then it may not go around your chest.  The string to tie it at your waste are only 12 inches long so you can not really tie it unless you are a size 0-2 at the waist.  Very disappointed."
3.0,"My son really liked the strap and it did a great job keeping his glasses in the correct position, but after just 10 days the plastic that loops around the arm of the broke. Very disappointed."
3.0,"Super tiny for petite persons. I had to unzip it fully to fit across the front, which is not how clothes typically fit me."
3.0,Within a few days it loses air and now its doesn't want to stay up anymore by itself
3.0,"The small was way too big for me, but it seems like a true small.  Even tightening the bottoms all the way they are still too big on me.  The straps on the top are way too long but the actual front is pretty cute.  If you have some sewing skills to adjust the straps on the top I am sure you can make it work.  Would work great on a person who typically wears a small.  For reference I am 5'1 and about 89 pounds so I am usually an xxs or xs depending on item."
3.0,"It is a little short on tall people, more of a shirt than a dress and the navy blue was more of a real than blue."
3.0,Wristband is small and it looks cheap
3.0,"Not for me. Material was stuffy and feels cheap. Decent gamble for the price, but overall disappointed."
3.0,Nice material<br />Comfy fit & classy look
3.0,"A few loose threads. I hope that they don’t continue to unravel.<br /><br />Nice gloves, with loose fit."
3.0,"Pretty flimsy. I’ve only worn them a few times, but I’m concerned the nose pieces will break off."
3.0,Beautiful detail amd fabric bit way smaller sizes than stated. My junior's size Md fits into your largest size.  Too bad since it's so pretty.
3.0,finger threads gave way much too soon for light use
3.0,"First all, I ordered the mint green. What I received was a very pretty aqua. Not what I expected, but was still very nice. It's a good thickness...lighter than a lot of sweatshirts, but great for when you just need a little something.  My main problem with it was the sleeves. Even though the weight was perfect, color ok, the sleeves were several inches too long and I didn't like how they were bunched at the wrist.  For those it might help, on the XL, the sleeve length is 27"""
3.0,the saddle flares on these are really small.  i am worried that they will fall out.  otherwise they are nice.
3.0,These sunglasses 🕶 seem to have a lot of glare for being polarized. Unisex style IMO.  The frames are very lightweight and remind me of dollar store glasses I buy if I forget my good sunglasses. The sunglasses are light and don’t hurt your nose or ears.  The case is excellent so I use the case for my good sunglasses now.  Nothing special about these sunglasses so I give them a solid three stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful 😊
3.0,"My husband wears 50L in suits, waist 42, length32/34 in pants, xxl general size. Hes 6'2&#34;, about 250lbs. We bought the xxl. In the right light, you can see the sheen, but don't expect it to look like the pic on the seller's page. The design of the coat was very nice, my husband liked the slimming effect of its structure, but it was too small for a guy who typically wears xxl. He got the jacket on, but could barely move his arms/shoulders. The pants were about 2 sizes too small, he couldn't even get up them past his thighs. The single button on the suit jacket was already falling off. The vest was ok looking, fit appropriately. The tie is nothing like the one in picture as it is very cheap-looking, skinny, and totally different color from the vest. It's too late to try to reorder for our event, but maybe in the future we'll try again a size up if available just because my husband likes the long tail and structure of the jacket."
3.0,It’s cute... and simple
3.0,This was great.. until the front closure broke.<br />I like that it has a firm grip on the skin. It is light and feels smooth. The front lock should have been made of something sturdier.
3.0,It just hangs there!😂
3.0,"As the reviewer said, this dress fully opens.If you have big breasts as I do, you will either have to go a size up or use a shirt under because this dress won't cover almost anything. The dress is also very short (it is short on me and I am 5'4&#34;). I love the color and the print, but unfortunately it didn't look good on me."
3.0,If your think that this set is super good material it's not . The pants are fine but better if you have curves or else it looks a little awkward. The top or (hoodie) is cheap and thin so be mindful also the zipper is cheap as well if you have big boobs the hoodie may not zip all the way. it's a 7 out of ten a
3.0,I love the shirt just runs really small
3.0,"Yess, it not bad!"
3.0,"For this price, I was unimpressed. Material is thin and the color was more of a khaki versus stone."
3.0,"It fits well and is very comfortable, but it lacks support. If you're smaller up top, this would probably be a great bra. But for someone like me (40D), it's comical to think of doing any high impact workout with this. I tried jogging with this once; I might as well have not had a bra on."
3.0,a little tight wish it would have come assembled wtf... why did I have to attach the clasps and make slits myself?
3.0,lint ALL OVER the place  loved it all but that . I haven't warn in again
3.0,"I purchased several dresses, all in different colors. While two fit perfectly, one was far too small (mainly too short). The dresses that did fit were great, especially for the cheaper price. I have found that I can dress them up or down, depending on how I accessorize and what I pair with the dress. I have noticed, however, that the fabric tends to stain very easily, and even using a stain remover hasn't seemed to work. Overall, these are nice dresses to put into a wardrobe rotation, but, as can be expected from the cost, they have their pitfalls."
3.0,I didn’t like that it came in a big lava lager only for<br />It to come in a ziplock bag when it was supposed to come in a little pouch but didn’t
3.0,Skirt is shorter than I thought it would be and too flared so I cut the skirt off.
3.0,Very flattering!  Nice colors
3.0,These were alright. One of them was missing a rhinestone and the other was rusted.
3.0,"I am need material that is a little forgiving in my dresses (I've had three kids).  While the dress was pretty, I ended up returning it because it wasn't super flattering on me."
3.0,"This suit is cute, but it was a bit too cheeky for my liking."
3.0,These are really pretty but run very small. I ordered the 10/12 for my very thin 8 year old and they fit snug. Definitely size up at least 1 size.
3.0,Huge and dramatic shoulder pads but true to color and the fur looked as pictured. I returned dueto the body shape
3.0,"Was too big, but I was easily able to add more holes to both belts. Afterwards, it looked amazing! Great material, amazing deal!"
3.0,Well made. Basic enough travel cup. Oddly sticky handle that doesnt seem to wipe off. A gift for someone hard to shop for but I probably wouldn't buy again. Got here before estimated delivery date.
3.0,"Great as a toy, but terrible as a costume piece.  The watch is over sized and very obviously  (more so than pictured) plastic.  Furthermore the button which makes it talk is so easy to accidentally press as it sits in the pocket of my vest it became quickly annoying."
3.0,Nice boots it was a bit small but I'm keeping them hoping as I use them they will fit right.
3.0,Broke after only two weeks of wearing .  want to return for refund
3.0,The color on the picture is different from what was actually received by it being more of a yellowish color and not gold. I gave this rating 3 stars only because the quality of the fabric was pretty good.
3.0,For a mans glove these are very small.  I ended up re-gifting them to a lady friend. Beware if you have large to x-large hands as they won't fit.
3.0,"Cute dress, just not proportioned right for me- I'd be inbetween sizes."
3.0,I love these but they are very cheap . The spikes came bent ! I had to unbend them they still aren't perfect but they are cute for what they are ! If they were made better they would be 5 stars !!!!
3.0,"not what I needed, returned."
3.0,"Very pretty shoe but runs very small, too bad it didn't have the size I needed or I would have ordered another pair"
3.0,"If you have a small neck this might not fit.  The package arrived on time, the product itself is somewhat sturdy, not sure how long it will hold up though."
3.0,"Bracelet very wide, makes it very difficult to wear with other bracelets."
3.0,Cute but unfortunately not the same socks as pictured 🤨  My boyfriend wears this bright neon yellow-green shirt to work every day today and I wanted these socks to match but unfortunately the sox did not match the picture. Will be returning
3.0,Very cute and trendy however it runs small.
3.0,"This was the costume that my daughter really wanted for her Halloween costume. She liked the outfit other than it arrived with a hole in it. Although the hole was easy to repair--it was to late to return it and get a new one before Halloween--the outfit is not made of very durable material and most likely won't last for long.<br /><br />The outfit did fulfill it's intended purpose though, which was a Halloween costume, for this year."
3.0,I don’t know what sweatshop made this but this has too much material on the back. Our son wore this and we had to bunch up the fabric in the back and pin it in place.  Much like human facelifts we’re done in the ‘70s through ‘80s. Just gross!
3.0,Slightly long for a petite 6 year old
3.0,"I bought the packets of 7 underwear and only I received 6. Also, the color was different that I choose."
3.0,Not the best quality but for the price their ok. A lot bigger than I expected.
3.0,Fit is accurate but fabric is pretty thin. Almost see through.
3.0,"I love the dress . It was just smaller than I thought it would be and may not lastbthe whole season if both my girls grow out of it . It is also ivory , not white."
3.0,"I’m 4’11 and this barely touched the floor. It wasn’t as long as I thought it would be. I wasn’t expecting a wire, so when it came I wasn’t sure it was the right thing. But it looked well when I put it on. The biggest problem was the Velcro wasn’t the best quality."
3.0,"Like the matching earrings, it is almost colorless and appears more grey than green.  Pendant is the same size as one earring."
3.0,3 stars only because it is one sided otherwise it is good quality
3.0,"Not very warm, it stated they had thinsulate in the lining, but no mention of thinsulate in the gloves we received.  My husband wore them and his hands froze in 15 degree weather. Supposed to be good to -20."
3.0,This mask is pretty but it doesn't have a nose bridge.. it's small for an adult mask and it wasnt as thick as I thought it would be and there is no pocket for a filter.. you cant not wear your glasses without them fogging up..cute but the functionality of this product isnt there for me
3.0,"I can’t evaluate the total value of the gloves in weather because I haven’t used them. They seem very well insulated but obviously are too bulky to do detail work. However, I will be using them for snow blowing and shoveling and they should work fine. I purchased my normal glove size (large) and found them to be too small even though I have an average sized hand. Be aware of this and consider buying a size up. Otherwise, these gloves appear to be a pretty good value for the money."
3.0,"this bracelet is truly beautiful, unfortunately it’s way too big for my 6.5 inch wrist! So be advised if your wrist is tiny, it won’t work even with the extra links. Will be returning"
3.0,Fits good but color a tad faded
3.0,They only come in one size. They are too short for my feet. I have thin legs and long thin feet.
3.0,It fall apart
3.0,I can only wish this fit!  I loved the suit but it was probably 3 sizes too small...and I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I wear.
3.0,Need a different chain
3.0,"Ordered a large, if it’s like an extra small"
3.0,"I bought these expecting to fit 0-6ish...they are toddler sized! Much too large. Adorable and we'll made, so will toss in a drawer for later."
3.0,does not hold the credit cards very well
3.0,Not great quality but It wasn't expensive. Got what I paid for.
3.0,Worked for the purpose I bought them for but flimsy.
3.0,"This is a really nice glasses case. Four stars for being really good but not great. The good part is that the materials and build quality are all good and I expect this thing to last a long time.<br /><br />But... how could it be made better. Go from good to great. For starters, it's a stiff case but not a hard case. It is too easy to crunch the contents of the case - see the attached photo. No bueno. Also, that little plastic carabiner isn't the easiest to operate an I dearly want to replace it with a good one. However, the way that it is sewn in makes that suboptimal. I think the solution there is to cut it off and run a loop of paracord through the loop.."
3.0,"I wa excited about this canvas/ wall hanging, but upon arrival and closer review, I was less than impressed.  The watercolor is not nearly as prominent as portrayed, is blurry, and is “off” regarding the continents.  In order to return the item I would have had to pay shipping (despite being amazon prime eligible?), which was two dollars less than purchase price.  So, I decided to just keep it.  Also, the price has gone up since my date of purchase.  I’d avoid this one."
3.0,"Sooo, when I first got this shirt, I was so excited it! The color was awesome, the fit was great... a little bit looser which was perfect to wear with leggings. I wore this for thanksgiving... and in the picture you can tell, I am happy, but the problem was the washing.... I wash this separately in the delicate setting of my washing machine. When I took it out to dry, the black color of the pumpkin had blended with the shirt. ☹️🥺 I only wore once.. this is why I am not giving a better review"
3.0,Very hard taking the pants off because of the ankle is so tight.
3.0,I want to love them but it's hard. I don't have small feet. I wear a 9.5-10 in women's shoes. The toes are too long and look goofy. Otherwise the rest fits and looks good. These don't have the stretch that I was expecting. If they stretched like gloves it would be better. Work on the toes and it'll be a better product.
3.0,"I was really excited about these goggles having had strong goggle eye marks and occasionally sensitivity after swimming with a pair of Rokas. I tried these in swimming pools for short stretches and thought my goggle eye days were over! They also seemed more comfortable than the Rokas overall.<br /><br />However, I wore them for a 40 min open water swim in cold water and had some serious goggle eyes afterwards. I had even adjusted the fit to the point that water slightly came into one eye, so I don’t think they were overtightened. They also fogged up severely despite using anti-fog spray.<br /><br />They’re still nice goggles, but I’m not sure I’d buy them again knowing the “custom fit” doesn’t seem to help in my case."
3.0,They are too long and too tight by the knee and I got an XL so that it wouldn’t be so tight.
3.0,Too big and went with the recommended sizing
3.0,looks great help up for months but began to fade. do not wear in the shower
3.0,What is this? Shorts for ants?! But honestly they're super cute. Too bad. XL is actually a S.
3.0,It was a bit too big for me. So won't wear them out but to relax at home outside they do the job. For the price it was worth the gamble.
3.0,Buttons were broken off upon arrival
3.0,The material I am not particularly fund of. It looks cheap. This dress also runs small. I bought a XXL and I am a size 12. I only gave it three stars because I like the style of the dress and the print.
3.0,"I’m 5’7”, 180lbs and curvy and the XL was Still a bit too snug"
3.0,The item is not as bright as pictured but it is pretty and easy to put on...only thing is my hair tends to get caught on the prongs holding the stone. So if you wear your hair loose often this might not be for you.
3.0,If you are looking for a robe to keep warm and cozy then this is a great one. This was a gift for my daughter to wear after her showers and she will not wear it for that. She says it feels sticky and doesnt absorb the water although she does wear it for warmth.
3.0,very affordable nice looking shorts but when you wash them you have to be careful with the the top thing in the front it will loosen and wrap around the clothes so that's the only complaint I have
3.0,"It's a nice design, but sizing is off. The top fits but the bottoms are too big, and I'm not exactly small. I'm 5'8&#34;, just under 170 pounds, around a 38C cup size with a nice size butt. The top is close to the sizing chart, but the bottoms are very loose and they are still dry. I can't wear them in the water or they will fall off."
3.0,"Okay... so I bought two of these hats one in the oatmeal and the other in Burgundy/gray/black. Now the first thing is the product is not consistent... so the oatmeal one was suuuuper slouchy and the pompom was as larger as my fat head. It also had to be rolled to fit properly. All in all I was satisfied with my oatmeal hat.<br /><br />However, the burgundy hat was fairly fitted. Not so much slouch as my sister wanted (not even close to the oatmeal). The pom was considerably smaller almost what you'd imagine an average pom to be. It couldn't be rolled at all and that was disappointing. She liked it but she wanted to steal mine.<br /><br />Also they have the CC mark on the hats but that is faux... the brand is NYFASHION101. This was stated clearly in the title  but I apparently don't know how to read. That's my bad but i want to make that clear now.<br /><br />I guess my largest disappointment is that it's not accurate to the photos and the products are not uniform. 3/5"
3.0,"Love the heathered rose color. The shirt is soft and fits nicely, I'd say it's true to size. The design is an applique, and after several washes it's starting to crack."
3.0,Love this bracelet but it unlocks itself too easily. Fell off my arms a few times. Luckily i was aware eac time
3.0,Material is thick
3.0,"I’m 5’9” 153 lbs. ordered a Medium in the teal<br />The velvet and design is beautiful and it all fit. But it looked like I threw in the wash and shrunk the whole set. So if you are 5’6” or shorter, I’m sure this will fit great!"
3.0,Really cute shirt...ordered a small and its little big. But I still like it.
3.0,not true size fit
3.0,"Dress is OK. Its slightly see through. Very light weight cotton. I think i would like it more if it were t-shirt material ,but it will be a nice beach cover-up"
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed. The fabric is like tights, which can be comfy but I feel like I'm on display outside of the house -like if you are curvy, everything shows. The ""tan"" literally looks like I'm naked. My poor children thought I didnt have pants on 🤣🤣 I liked the black pair only and after one wash, I noticed a hole in the bum. Not sure if it was from the wash or getting snagged on something bc of the material.<br /><br />Wasn't for me, but I'm glad I got a deal on these."
3.0,"If you have a larger chest (I’m a G cup), this might not be the dress for you. I think the ruffled part is supposed to fall over your chest and hang down like it does on the model. It did not on me. That part ended on my chest and didn’t hang down at all. Looked super weird on me so I returned it. Cute pattern though!"
3.0,A bit smaller than advertised.  My wrist measures 7 1/2 &#34; circumference and this so called 8&#34; bracelet is so tight I can't wear it.  Think I will return.
3.0,"Though I love the style and have no issues with the chain, the &#34;gold&#34; plating on the disc is chipping off around the disc. It's been worn a handful of times in 2 months and on top of clothing.  In spite of this will continue to wear it."
3.0,"I use these for running. I am pretty gifted up top so I need a lot of help keeping the girls in place. This almost did the job! There was still bounce but at least I could get a run in without having to hold my boobs down. I like my bras snug so I wish I had gone a size or 2 sizes down to get it a bit more snug. Also it doesn't do much for shape, so if you're concerned about it making your boobs look good, this isn't the bra for you- there's zero lift/separation<br /><br />Actually I want to edit this: the bra stretches after one workout. By the end it does allow for a lot of bounce making it uncomfortable to use again. Probably will use this with a second sports bra under to help keep things under control"
3.0,"There are definitely pros and cons to these slacks. First the pros:<br />The color is beautiful. They are also dressier than I thought they would be.<br />Now the cons: I'm a big woman and 3x usually fits me with a little room to spare. These fit everywhere EXCEPT in the waist. I missed being able to button them by more than an inch after stretching the back which didn't have much elastic give.<br />I'm also concerned about the stitching. I found some loose along the leg seam.<br />I will probably add some elastic to the button area. They do zip close and I will wear with an over blouse. The event I wanted these for isn't until Thanksgiving so I will give an update after that.<br />Edit on 11/01/22<br />Lesson learned - look for sizing chart even when you think you know your size! After submitting my last review I heard from the company that they do not use regular sizing. Even if I went to their largest size, these paints would never fit me. I don't think the claim they are plus sized is even remotely accurate. Too bad, because they really are pretty."
3.0,A lil flimsy
3.0,"Cute print, soft, and has pockets but SIZE UP! It’s especially tight in the tummy area."
3.0,Material wasn't what I expected..NOT COTTON...
3.0,they run big and wide
3.0,"This dress didn’t have as much stretch as I hoped and anticipated. I am pregnant, and was looking for a stretchy, comfy cotton blend dress- this one does have some stretch but not as much as I’d hoped, the arms were tight, and due to my pregnant belly (18 weeks at the time, so a baby bump but not massive) the pockets poked out quite significantly. So if you have a flat belly you’ll be ok with this dress! I also felt that the arms were a bit tight too. The fabric is thick though, not see through!"
3.0,"However, I don't have any other brand of this product to compare it to. Maybe they are all the same. I got about 3 good uses out of it. The edges of the adhesive pad started to come off of the bra piece. You MUST wash it well the night before or a few hours before use to allow it to completely dry. And clean your skin very well, I used alcohol wipes."
3.0,poorly made and runs large
3.0,"Bought these for a Holtzmann costume. They glasses themselves where too big and sliding down my nose. Other than that, they're nice quality glasses."
3.0,"Fits nice, were just  for  legs was a little shorter. No big deal"
3.0,It is a pretty comfy dress. I had planned to wear it for my bridal shower but to cotton material makes it a little too casual and it really hugs my body. It’s so soft and cute that I plan to use it as a nightgown instead.
3.0,"We like the product but unfortunately the size is smaller than what we need. The window for returns has closed, but I was out of town, so I wasn’t able to return it. And it hasn’t been used nor will it be used. So, is it possible to return it or exchange it for the correct size?? Hopefully you understand."
3.0,"Pretty, but feels cheap. Looks lighter red like Chinese New Year red and gold. I like it somewhat."
3.0,"I was disappointed to find these just don’t fit an adult unless you have no hair, or a very small head. The button that activates the lights doesn’t work, so you have to put the tiny piece of paper back between the batteries to shut it off each time. I’ll give them to my grandsons to play with until the batteries wear out, which will be an hour or so."
3.0,The gumball colors are dull and not cheerful. I was hoping that they would be more like the colors on a real gumball.
3.0,"Fit was great for a US size 6, I ordered a small. Front pleat is not sitting right and material is stiffer than two other dresses I ordered from this company which were perfect. These dresses are all well made and therefore great value."
3.0,I was really excited for this sweater and it is very soft.  The neck and arms fit well and I like the length but I really don't like the way it flares as it goes down.  I feel like it makes me look wider as it goes down and hangs out if that makes sense.  I love so much about this sweater down to the side cut in detail but I really don't like how it hangs out and give me a triangle shape.
3.0,I ordered this slipper for my boy but it is smaller than I expected. My baby feet are chubby so I will need to get a bigger size.
3.0,These got rusty pretty fast :( I only had it for 1 month and got pretty ugly. It was very pretty and good quality just rusted too fast.
3.0,"Not sure why they're called ""compression.""  I bought to wear under dresses/blouses that show my bra straps. I kept them for that reason alone. A tad disappointing though.  I would not recommend."
3.0,The color was not what I expected. Not a true rec.
3.0,Good quality and color also fast shipping.what I dislike was that the mask was not firm whiled in activity used.
3.0,"The fit was perfect, the color was very pretty, but there was a flaw in the fabric that ran the entire length of the blouse in the front"
3.0,"Size is accurate, the colors were way off mark. Like neon orange truck.. looks more like a knock off product. At the end of the day I ordered it because it was inexpensive and it’s a beach tank for a toddler. Served its purpose."
3.0,"Nice bright, clever designs.<br />Disappointed that fabric is not 100 percent cotton.  Price is fair."
3.0,"I'm going to keep them, but they are a little short waisted and snug around the waist band.  Not as much stretch as other Dear John jeans I own.  But I think they'll be ok."
3.0,While these look nice online they didn't look good on me when they arrived. They are way to big for my face. Old-fashioned looking too like something from the seventies when such large frames were popular.
3.0,It’s even flesh colored.
3.0,I'm 5'5&#34; and the dress was a little too long
3.0,"I loved the shirt, nice soft material. I normally wear a XL and I ordered a 3XL and it was still too snug for my liking. When I would raise my arms part of my stomach would show."
3.0,The shorts have a good weight and fit except that they are very high waisted. They will look fine with an untucked shirt but I’m not sure I understand why they are cut so high. They also do not come with the belt that is shown in the picture.
3.0,"The eye patch was really great for “appearance”, as being a little scary!<br />It was not real flexible, but that might be difficult to do, being it has to cover the eye and be durable.<br /> I was afraid to wash it by hand, so sprayed the patch with disinfectant, and let it dry completely.<br />I  was using the patch for a dual purpose, both medical and comical reasons.<br /> Others that viewed it, loved it, and thought it was very effective!"
3.0,"Fit is ok, except length of pants. Too short and No pockets. Too spendy for not being totally happy with them. Quality construction though."
3.0,"We liked it in the picture, but once on, it looked liked a dress a pilgrim would wear with the collar. We couldnt find the reciept, otherwise we would return it. We'll have to find someone to alter it to our likes."
3.0,The picture is burly and big unlike the photo online
3.0,the shirt was fine but it was just to large.
3.0,Not good for school or everyday use as the fabric breaks easily
3.0,The length of these is great. I’m 6’ tall and they actually are long enough. I do not fold over the waist though so they come up a little higher on my stomach but it gives them the necessary length I need. The material is thin though so you do have to watch what you wear under it because that is a serious concern for me especially because I got them to wear to work where I teach preschool.
3.0,"I bought this purse for my wife, but it's really big. It's more like a shopping bag than a purse. Her old purse, which contained everything but the kitchen sink, could easily fit inside this one, so make sure you want a big one, before you buy it.<br /><br />It looks good, and appears to be high quality, if only it were smaller. I marked it 3 stars only because it was much bigger than expected. If it had been the right size, it would have been 5 stars."
3.0,There is is a lining to these pants I wasn't aware of and didn't like. It takes away from the flow of the pants. Doesn't fit well.
3.0,Comfortable but doesn’t fit like the picture. Go a size smaller
3.0,Printed logo. Not stitched.  Disappointed in quality.
3.0,"I like the dress, I'm still undecided about the belt that came with it."
3.0,I bought these for my 7 year old daughter.<br /><br />Pros:  They did effectively block the odor and they were not bulky<br />Cons:  Only 3 cutting outlines to choose from and even then you have to keep estimating and cutting down until you get it right.<br /><br />My daughter didn't like the feel of these in her shoes so they were out in a few days.  I cannot say whether that was due to product or preference (7 year old's are picky creatures!)
3.0,"Great for the money, but it doesn’t look so good worn. I wouldn’t recommend."
3.0,"Honestly, the plastic of the headband hurt my head. However, I do have a bigger cranium than most ladies I know, so if you think it’ll work for you, go ahead! I gave it three stars because the horns looked good, but everything else felt kinda cheap."
3.0,Super shirt
3.0,"So I ordered a medium in the bottoms, but these were way smaller than most of the other size small bottoms I purchased from Amazon. I'm not sure why they're so tiny but there's no chance my butt will fit in these. It's a shame because the material and quality looked decent and they would've been cute with the matching rash guard top."
3.0,"This would be fine for prom, but not much else. And definitely not with a dark color dress. Sparkles everywhere. I ended up not keeping this. Looking for something a little nicer."
3.0,"I love the way these look! They are gorgeous, but my nipples are to fat and won’t fit. 😭"
3.0,Pretty blouse but the arms/shoulders were tight and the chest area was huge. The V neck was very low. It was also extremely wrinkled. I returned it.
3.0,"Sucks they arrived late and the clasps damaged. I do have a butt, but you cant tell in these giant shorts!! Buy a size lower FOR SURE"
3.0,"Got compliment from husband, but fits somewhat small. Losing a few more pounds I'm sure it'll fit me perfect then. Motivational Weightloss Dress!!!"
3.0,"They're stretchy so they'll fit broader thighs but the heart gets stretched and distorted. Doesn't look right. They are also pretty long, but I am only 5'3 so a lot of clothes are too long for me. Lol"
3.0,It’s cute... but it’s a lot thinner than I thought it would be. It’s more on the dainty side. When I put it on it wasn’t what I wanted really. It’s ok but if I saw how it actually looked on someone’s hand that would have been more helpful and I wouldn’t have bought it.
3.0,"The fabric felt like a good material and it was made well. However, the bowtie came with a line down the side; it looks like dirt. It won't come off. Oh well, it's only for one night..."
3.0,I like the fact that these covers still look like new. They wear very well. The downside is the material is thick so it is super hard to press any buttons. Also you must have a tiny loop or ring that goes through your remote and the cover to hold it in place or it slides off. This is not included.
3.0,"Cute leggings, but not squat proof.  I can see my underwear through them when I bend over."
3.0,The ring is not as delicate as it was shown in the image
3.0,Screws came loose very quickly. Looks good but didn’t last.
3.0,These were a little snug and fit funny.  It was probably just me. But not for me.
3.0,"I bought this dress for my middle daughter for her sister's wedding. It is a beautiful shade of green and it didn't take too long to get here. I ordered a size large due to the measurements on the description as well as it indicates that it runs small. However, the breast area of the dress was too large. I ended up ordering a medium after in hopes that it would fit better and get here in time for the wedding. The new dress should be here soon. If the medium fits better I'll probably be sending the large back."
3.0,"Not fluffy at all!  Should have sized,  up arms are tight."
3.0,"Great looking, nice size, fast shipping.<br />Unfortunately irritated ears, unable to wear.<br /><br />Beautiful, but irritate ears. Changed color to a bronze after a month."
3.0,It was smaller and the color wasn’t what I expected
3.0,"I can't give these 5 stars because  they are not tight enough to help the<br />circulation in my legs.  If I had fat legs,  they might help but I have<br />average-sized legs and they just don't help."
3.0,"This is not cotton, more like spandex. Ordered an extra large and it was way too big. This is not something you would were out to a gathering in the heat because it makes you sweat."
3.0,"I really like this, but I found that it is very hard to bend and it's not very shiny.  Other than that it is really nice."
3.0,Definitely made for petite smaller girls. Looks nothing like the picture as far as fit.
3.0,There was a hole in the dress where the skirt connects to the top half and the belt it came with is not a belt that would fit my proportions at all.
3.0,I have a 32 bra size and still my bra doesn't fit in here unless folded with one of the cups backwards. Not what the picture shows and not my expectation. Would not purchase for this purpose again.
3.0,"Very comfortable and light. However the lense is curved and for some people -  me being one - it distorts my vision and makes it Blurry. I swim in the ocean, so maybe in a pool you would not notice? I kept them all the same. Had tried another curved pair and almost threw up due to how distorted the vision was. Compared these aren’t so bad."
3.0,"Not bad.... They are a little long for a forward helix piercing, and the back is a little bigger than I would like, but they're fine for what I need."
3.0,It easily get scratch.
3.0,Great but not for long term use. It's very flimsy.
3.0,not oversized more square
3.0,The words inside the charm are very small and slightly blurry. It does not look clear like the image advertised.
3.0,The material is strange I can't explain it but it won't last very long.
3.0,"Get a size bigger as other reviews said. I got one in dark green and it sheds a lot, especially from the inside."
3.0,"It’s a good size and shiny, material looks quality. The size of font for “everyone wishes” is very small, have to squint to read it."
3.0,"It does seem to be good quality, but it’s definitely larger than it looks in the picture."
3.0,"One pair of earrings, the blue and yellow, had black enamel smeared all over. Unusable."
3.0,"Love the watches, they work great!"
3.0,not fitted it yet...but looks okey.
3.0,Already turning colors. Stone looks plastic.
3.0,"This dress would have been cute but I have DDs and the chest is way too tight! I’m also tall (5’ 8”) so that, with the large chest makes the bodice not fit quite right. My torso is too long for this dress. I have an hourglass figure big chest, big hips. The hips fit fine, and it can down to my knees."
3.0,"This watch is cute and I get a lot of compliments on it, however it does not keep time correctly."
3.0,Cute for what I needed but too heavy for prolonged wear
3.0,"Bought this for 2 teenagers, but they were much bigger than expected and definitely not made for someone on the petite side."
3.0,Much smaller and lighter than I thought.
3.0,"It's completely see through! I guess I expected a slip to be sewed in underneath, but the whole thing is see through"
3.0,Thin material and will def lose shape n stretch out! And shoulders straps don’t stay very well
3.0,Skirt is really flowy
3.0,"Fits like expected. Purchased medium.  It does give you some back support. Although, I wish it had more shoulder support. It would be great if it pulled your shoulders back. Then it would have definitely helped correct my posture.<br />I do feel it is too expensive for only some back support. Maybe it is not meant for woman who are looking for that extreme pull back and support."
3.0,they are excellent. but where they placed the sticker takes away from the great look..glad they are for work...
3.0,"I love the width and color of the rings but as stated by other reviews, the inscription might as well not be there as it's basically invisible unless you are looking for it. Not terrible for the price though."
3.0,Nice size but lens popped out upon opening.. had to rig them.. they hurt behind my ears too but overall cute
3.0,Pay $4.00 more and buy the ILLUMINATOR version of this watch.  The light is not LED - you can't easily read the time in the dark.
3.0,"I don't hate this bra, but I don't like it nearly as much as the Enell Sport Bra and the Panache Women's Underwired Sports Bra."
3.0,Doesn’t open as wide as products picture nor is it as pink colored.
3.0,Way too small...like something to fit a doll
3.0,"BOUGHT THESE BECAUSE MY FEET WERE ACHING IN MY WORK BOOTS. AFTER WEARING THESE FOR MONTHS NOW, HAVE NO ISSUES WITH MY FEET HURTING AT WORK. DECIDED TO UPDATE MY REVIEW AS I SEE THESE ARE TWICE THE PRICE NOW . I HAVE USED THEM FOR WORK FOR ABOUT TEN MONTHS AND THOUGH THEY WERE COMFORTABLE MOST OF THE TIME,THE LAST MONTH OR SO THEY ARE COMING APART AT THE SEAMS AND MY FEET HURT AGAIN. WAS GOING TO BUY THEM AGAIN, BUT THE PRICE DOES NOT MATCH THE QUALITY-THEY WERE ABOUT $50 THAT SHORT TIME AGO..NOT WORTH IT."
3.0,"I bought this hat to replace another hat thinking it was the same thing just black, the one being replaced was brown, but the mesh part of the hat is very soft and flexible unlike most other mesh hats. That is the only thing I do not like about it. Other than that it’s a good hat and breaths well in the heat."
3.0,"The sweater is a great material for the price! I returned because the image doesn’t reflect what I received. The sweater delivered was not as loose fitting in the torso as the image and the collar is tight and like a crew neck, not wide or boat like in the photo"
3.0,"I really liked this product when I saw it on the site but when I went to wear it, i saw that the clamp was broken. Very disappointed."
3.0,All 4 pairs of earrings look great! However I could not unscrew the big leaf earring... I tried hard but it is stuck!
3.0,I like the style very much but the material was quoted as ‘cotton’ and it is 95% poly!!!! That means it will ball up quickly. The zipper is very cheap also.
3.0,I bought this hoping to wear it in the water over my swimsuit. It fits like a loose shirt. Also the collar was almost a “boat” collar shape and gapped on the sides. I expected it to fit around my neck somewhat securely with the zipper up.
3.0,they are very small
3.0,Pockets ripped and button button broke within a  week of use. Does keep cold out.
3.0,"The dress runs big, but value for the money. I bought it for Haloween ( I was the Golden Snitch) but plan to wear it for an evening out. I had to cut the bottom and the sleeves to make it fit."
3.0,"Decent for the money. Solid band choker broke with first use, but the other tow two have held up reasonably. Also, if you wear them for a long time, they leave a slight discoloration on your skin due to the material."
3.0,Had them for a week. They seem to run large. But they help my feet so I'm happy so far
3.0,"I knew from ordering MaryCrafts dresses that I would need to size up. But I couldn't even get these zipped. I typically wear pants in 8-10 so I ordered large, 10-12. I am 57 and weigh 153 lbs.  I'm glad I ordered long, because in the future, that is the length I want. Just long enough to wear a little heel with.  The color and feel of the pants were great and would be wonderful for warmer months. I returned them but didn't reorder."
3.0,Love it BUT it comes apart too easily and will probably come apart sometime when I’m not paying attention then BYE BYE pretty bracelet
3.0,Cheaply made and breaks easy
3.0,"Good color, material is thinner and scratchy. Will be returning"
3.0,"they do turn your fingers green, but for the price that is expected. All you gotta do is put a clear coat of nail polish on them every now and again and they will be just fine!!!!!!!"
3.0,I don’t know how to feel about this. It’s comfy and has some support but also accentuates your boobs. Like my boobs look perkier but somehow it’s still kind of supportive?<br />I like the style of the back and it’s a sports bra I can wear with clothing that aren’t just for working out and it not be obvious that I’m wearing a sports bra.<br />It also has these random clasps at the bottom I really don’t think they have a real reason to be there other than looks And though it makes a pretty cute slit it can also stab you sometimes. I wouldn’t buy again but it’ll be my summer casual wear bra so I don’t have to wear a real bra😂
3.0,"No what expected. There is a pocket looking thing on the side that pops out and I don't really know what it is but it gets in the way, material is nice. I will try to wears it like the picture. 😕"
3.0,"This was a cute dress, until I washed it.  (Cool, delicate cycle, air dry)  It shrunk.  However, it is now a cute tunic/top so I am still pleased.  I believe the top that I got was a return as there were no tags on it and no laundering instructions tag.  Be careful and hang or lay flat to dry this."
3.0,"After 3 days of use in these glasses the silicone nose piece, along with the screw came out.<br />Luckily I was able to grab the tiny screw and screw it back in temporarily but they continued to unscrew and I would have to re screw it in(this was only the left screw and nose piece, the right side was fine).<br />I was disappointed because I actually really liked them, very flattering for my round face and comfortable. But that nose piece was a deal breaker."
3.0,"Cute, comfy."
3.0,The yin and yang was really pretty however it didn't come with a cord.  I actually had to purchase one separately for it
3.0,"I bought these flip-flops as shower shoes for an Amtrak trip I'm taking next week. Hard plastic dries quickly, and the contoured upper surface isn't uncomfortable, but I'm 58 and have less padding on the platter surface of my feet than I used to. A good value and durable."
3.0,I like quality of these pants. But the picture showed set of 3 and only one came. The picture was very deceiving.
3.0,It has come off a few times. Could be I didn't attach it correctly.
3.0,"It keeps me warm, but looks pretty dumb and smells strange until washed a couple times. Worth it if its cold enough"
3.0,"They seem to run large.  I usually wear a 10.5 so I got the 11.  They are waaaay too wide and the heel fit is shallow...the back seems to be about 1/2"" too low.  Unfortunately, they accumulated fine dog fur while I was trying them on so I can't return them :(.  On the positive side, they seem to be made of quality materials with a nice sole.  So, if you have a wide foot, they may be good for you."
3.0,A little too dark but excellent quality
3.0,turns your figure colors. I felt no results
3.0,"I bought these just as PJs or to bum around the house. They are really comfy and stretchy. I love that they have pockets! I also really like the fit. I am a really awkward size right now, 3X can often be too small for me but a 4X too big. I got a 3X in these and they fit comfortably.<br /><br />The only issue is the seams are falling apart. I bought two pairs, in the first set the seams attaching the sleeves and at the crotch of the shorts have come undone. In the second set I bought the hem has come undone. I have a sewing machine so luckily it's a simple repair for me, and I love the PJs so much that taking the few minutes to fix them is worth it for me. But if that's not the case for you, I would probably go with a different set!"
3.0,Disappointed that it did not have a longer strap or the ability to makethe one it has longer. This one does not allow you carry on our shoulder. Its just too short
3.0,Not as long as I expected runs small
3.0,The bottom part seems to fit fine but the top part and the straps seem to be too large.
3.0,The fit was good except they just came up to my hips not my waist  more like a hipster instead of brief.  I guess I can live with a muffin top look if the padding did the job.
3.0,It looks nothing like the one in the picture. The side part is super weird and boxy looking and the neck area is almost like a weird triangle. I duno I don't hate it enough to return it but I don't love it. Waiting for warmer weather to play around with it. 5'5 174lbs and I think I got a large
3.0,"I'm sad to have to return this, it's very cute, well made, and a great length. I think I should have gone a size down."
3.0,"Great Fit for 2 year old, sizing is right on. Quality of sewing is iffy. Had 2 weeks and already a seam has ripped and stuffing is coming out."
3.0,"Great fabric,  soft but way too small. I usually wear S or M, and I ordered L, and it is unwearable, very small."
3.0,They aren’t knee length... maybe I missed that in review
3.0,The item is as described and it's admirable it is for charity. However it can easily break and I felt the price wasn't worth it. I could return it but I'm not bothering.
3.0,"Lasted about 6 months before the frame's protective coating wore off and got flakey, from just sweat, sunlight and light handling and also the 2 rubber nose pads started coming off."
3.0,It's super cute and comfy but it's too short for my torso. I ordered a medium and it wasn't long enough. I tried to order a large in an extra large but I accidentally ordered a medium and extra large. the extra large is long enough but it doesn't really support my chest and is a little bit loose so I ordered a large. If my torso was shorter it would have definitely worked. The chest was tight enough that I didn't need an underwire despite having a chest that need support. The straps are also adjustable which was really nice!
3.0,"The silicone band is a little thick but it’s nice and pliable and the two band collars are good.  However, the pins were too short and I had to get them out of the band and use my old pins."
3.0,Fits  good since its brand new
3.0,"The seller was perfect. This is such a cute sweatshirt, but why does Nike feel the need to cut girls clothing so fitted? My son has the boys version in the exact same size and it is very generously fitting. Disappointing from Nike"
3.0,It does not look the same and a little odd to tie. The chest area is fitted awkward so it looks unflattering at times
3.0,Bagged inside the box had to untie the chain beautiful though
3.0,"Too little, appearing more suited for females."
3.0,This is absolutely for the tiniest heads in the world. Like super tiny. I really loved the design but it would only fit my head completely at specific angles and then it was hell to take off afterwards.
3.0,"Wife wore it for Super Hero event,too snug"
3.0,"This is a beautiful swimsuit and my daughter loves it, but it's TINY. She just started wearing 4T, is only 38 inches tall and 32lbs and the size 4T was very snug. I wish I had purchased the larger size. It won't fit very long."
3.0,Very snug and tight on the wrist but very stylish. The crystal butterfly is a cute touch. I would not feel comfortable wearing it to bed. Nice for a dressy outfit
3.0,"Pretty dress but too big for me. I am 5 foot, 123 pounds, lean (14% body fat), 32C, and I ordered a medium after reading reviews.. big mistake. Should have went with small or extra small. The length was okay but everything else was huge!"
3.0,They are okay. 2 out of the 3 were tanks. The other had complete sleeves. We were a little confused however were leaving for vacation so there was no time to reorder. I think he’d order again if they had the muscle type shirts.
3.0,"These were great right out of the box, loved them!  After about ten uses the began to blur.  I made the mistake of attempting to clean them with a lens cloth and this totally screwed up the lenses now it's like looking through a kaleidoscope.  This was my fault as the accompanying instructions clearly state not to clean or touch the lenses.  I ordered another pair to give them another shot because I enjoyed my initial experience so much.  I will update my review"
3.0,Great design and quality but not big enough to fit my phone.
3.0,The thin material is nice for being light weight but is see through. With the material being so thin the pockets appear bulky. I wouldn't wear this without something on underneath. Thin material also doesn't feel the most flattering- shows everything.
3.0,Use these for tree work and didn't last a week.
3.0,"Super tight hoodie , pants are super loose on the waist. It’s rising up on the hoodie part and pants keep falling down . Doesnot have this problem with anything else she wears . I’m super sad about this , really thought it was cute till it was on her ."
3.0,"I ordered two of these, a &#34;Brown-pu&#34; and a &#34;Black-mirror.&#34;  I received the Brown-pu purse. It's a bit bigger than I expected, but it is what I wanted. I plan on using this for my phone, my debit card, my ID, maybe some cash, and a chapstick. And there's no issues with my phone screen through the window. If you experience problems, I think it's with the phone's sensitivity, not the bag.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I received a &#34;MINICAT Roomy Pockets Series Small Crossbody Cell Phone Purse Wallet Bag&#34; instead of the black-mirror phone purse. This is, by the way, $6 cheaper than what I paid. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's not what I ordered, and not what I want. So I'm returning it. I bought these for a vacation that is in 2 days, so I won't be reordering due to time constraints. But honestly, I'm a little leery about ordering from this vendor again anyway.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the items, just received the wrong one."
3.0,"Ran very small.  Nice sweater, but it's like two sizes smaller than it should be."
3.0,"The product is fine and seems like a good quality.  They are very hard for me to put in though.  There is quite a curve to the post and I have been struggling to put them in.  That might be my personal challenge though.  They are pretty and just what I expected, but I am not managing them very well."
3.0,Super long so it's all bunched up by the legs. Rough edges. Hate the button fly. Made in China. Nice spandex stretch material though.
3.0,"Wish it was a little shorter. Because I'm short. Suppose if you're taller than like 5' 4"" it would be okay."
3.0,"Read that these pants ran small so I ordered an x-large considering I normally wear Med/Large.  They fit fine in the legs and bum area, but the waist is way too loose."
3.0,"I like the material and color, however the way you have to adjust the hat really sucks! Makes it difficult to adjust when worn daily. It’s a slide adjustment and the loose or extra string tucks inside hat lining."
3.0,Kind of small but overall ok.  Worked for halloween
3.0,"Better than expected! I was a little nervous to purchase after reading a review that compared this dress to a beach cover up, but after I received it I was happy that I went ahead and ordered. It's very flattering and just the right legnth (about 5 inches above my knee) I am 5'2. I think you could wear this as a dress with a slip underneath, but I'm planning on wearing it as more of a tunic with leggings and boots. A great price for a cute peice of clothing!<br /><br />Update: I have to change this to 3 stars because the waist tie broke my second time wearing it! I had to walk around (only second week at new job) with a broken tie which was a little embarrassing. Cute dress but could be better made."
3.0,"Just as pictured. Can fast. They are short in the leg. I have not washed them yet as I am scarred they will shrink more. I am 5'2 and the leg is like a summer crop pant length. As it is so close to St Paddy's Day I am going to make them work, just fyi."
3.0,Color is spot on but you can’t see the word love at all.
3.0,Wondering it is real wood?? And I didn't realize that the back was branding for the manufacturer.
3.0,Looks like a darker pink in the picture but it is more like a light coral pink instead. I would have preferred the color in the picture.
3.0,The bottom of the sleeve is tight but otherwise I like the fit and the length.
3.0,This jersey was way to small I ordered a 4xl and it at best a 2xl but that being said it is made well and seems rugged I just wish it fit lol!
3.0,On the smaller size. My daughter is a 7/8 and is very thin and the medium belt barely fits her.
3.0,They are comfortable and have a nice finish but pretty plain looking. Wide foot.
3.0,Unflattering! Such pretty colors though.
3.0,"Was a bit disappointed. This is not really sturdy. It is attractive, but somewhat cheap looking."
3.0,the picture makes it look like a light blue but it was a lot darker blue and the wires come out a little to far on the jewel
3.0,I received the rose quartz earrings for Christmas from my in-laws. The stone is beautiful but they are way too heavy. I can’t swear these without worrying about my piercing holes stretching so sadly they are being regifted.
3.0,"Way too small so much so it is uncomfortable. ""Extra Large"" men must not weigh much over 100 lbs in your world!!!"
3.0,Material not impressive so makes for an expensive pair of yoga pants.
3.0,Size is great.  Weight is super heavy.  Check the shipping weight to see how heavy.
3.0,the shape of this bra is very different as it shows in the picture. The bra does not have much support for large breasts  (38G)
3.0,"The front pockets are weird because you can see the whole outline of them when you wear them, and the crotch area is oddly big and baggy."
3.0,"I really like the style of the pants, but they aren’t stretchy..other than that they’re great"
3.0,This hat is more red than orange but worked for hunting (with required vests). I don't believe Law Enforcement would consider this a part of the minimum amount of orange. Still safe though.
3.0,"Packaging is ok. When I first opened, I immediately noticed it is a cheap material. I got good compliments from my husband and very vocal niece.<br />This dress is nothing fancy. You need the right curves so it will shape your body. It is very ordinary, that with the same fabric, I feel like i can make this. Btw, this is better a sleeping gown than a late-night dress."
3.0,Cute top but it is not true to size. I usually wear a XL but got a a XXL is too tight
3.0,Quality is pretty good but the sizing is totally off
3.0,"My item arrived four days late, and came with a stain on it. The product was much smaller than indicated on the size chart. I had high hopes for this based off other reviews. Will be returning."
3.0,Its too small to fit on the waist...plz order ur exact size as it describes in the size chart...otherwise its a very pretty dress
3.0,"You get what you pay for. I know that there might be better. Looks rolex-y, feels tacky, crown is impossible to pull out (I literally use my teeth). And it’s just and eh."
3.0,Super cute loved them. However the warranty is kind of a lie. You have to join a Facebook group. They never add you. My daughter dropped them on a walk and they got run over before I back tracked to them.  I dont know if that is within warranty but there is no way to make a claim.
3.0,The quality of the products were not up to the mark. Service was good
3.0,"I didn't expect top notch quality for the price, and I was right. They look nice, however the two non-adjustable bracelets broke within days from snapping on a door handle. However, the two adjustable bracelets are holding up fine."
3.0,"The size--and I ordered an extra-large--was way too snug. And the pin holding the tie in place, which I expected, was not part of the package. But the sizing is way off, as others indicated which led me to order a larger size than normal, but it is still way too small."
3.0,"Once I figured out how to make it work it is ok and looks nice on the hat. A couple things to note: First; the band I got does not attach to itself. No hook or velcro. It is simply a ""ribbon"" with a bow attached at one end. On mine the inside of the bow had was open so I could fold the other end into a point of sorts and push it thru the bow. Do this first and pull the end just enough to get it to stay. Then put it on the had and position it how you want and the proceed to tighten it up on the hat. Once you get it how you want then I guess you could use a needle and thread to tack the free end to the bow end to keep it from coming apart. Second issue is that mine came folded so it has fold creases. You should be able to iron those out before you attempt to attach it to the hat. This was a bit more work than I had anticipated. I  wish  the seller had included a more accurate description of the item and included some instructions."
3.0,"Very small, I order xxL thinking I'd have room to move, burning cannot get this zippered.<br />Beautiful coat, as pictured.<br />*Really wish I could lose weight to wear it!!<br />😁"
3.0,"I love the quality of the hat, it is just too s n.v all. More child size, but very nice."
3.0,Supper cute but a bit too small
3.0,Was not as long as I wanted.
3.0,"The quality seemed fine however, doesn't stay up at all....the item ran large as well."
3.0,BEWARE.... THEY RUN SMALL!!!!!
3.0,"Jacket description says it has a zip out liner, this would make it a good choice for spring/fall or winter riding. However after getting this jacket today ( 5 stars for shipping) it does not have this option. While the attached liner is not thick and will work well for cool weather, it can not be removed."
3.0,"Is as advertised, good price and seems to do it's job."
3.0,"It's long like in the picture, but as far as circumference it's a little snug if you have a fuller rear end or curvy legs. Not that satisfied. Otherwise the material is pretty soft and it looks like the picture"
3.0,"Looked the fabric, the problem is the shorts fitter perfectly and the shirt was too small!"
3.0,Cute style but cheap material. The hood is also oddly small. It's likely just for show and not functionality.
3.0,"I love it, but it's too big and slides around on the wheel! 😫"
3.0,The romper is pretty but its too big. I ordered a small and it fit me like an extra large.
3.0,Un poco grueso
3.0,"I got the yellow/green in a small I am 5'2&#34; and 110. Fit great. Made the mistake of wearing black and white polka dot underwear... It was slightly visible through the stripe but only if I was looking intensely. A longer shirt easily covers that. Leggings held up fine for a 3 day backpacking trip. They were an okay temperature for hiking, but got quite warm in sunlight. On the second day I noticed a loose thread along near the top, but otherwise withstood light hiking and thorns. Wore for entire time sleep and day didn't smell horribly, though extensive time infront of campfire smoke may have helped with that. It withstood light hiking but I noticed once I got home that a noticeable amount of fabric had worn away from sliding down a boulder. If you plan on climbing rough surfaces I would suggest wearing shorts to protect the leggings."
3.0,This dress fits very well but it looks & feels like a slip or nightgown. Even though it is lined you can see the entire outline of your body in backlight. I almost kept it because it is light as a feather & would be great for travel but it was simply too thin. I could have put a slip under it but it still looks like a nightgown.
3.0,Flimsy but hey
3.0,"Yo no veo bien ni de lejos ni de cerca y tener un ojo con la medida y el otro no, me marea"
3.0,"The owl pendant itself is cute, thus the 3 stars but the chain is extremely cheaply made.  The clasp arrived broken and it looks tarnished so the chain is useless anyway.  I understand this isn't a high priced necklace but I've honestly seen better made jewelry at dollar stores.  Also, the owl was way larger and heavier than expected, I should have paid more attention to the actual dimensions - that is my bad.  I think the owl would make a great key chain rather than a necklace and could probably be converted to one fairly easy.  The tail on the owl moves slightly which is a neat feature.  Overall though I would not purchase again."
3.0,Pequeño : no<br />Medio : si<br />Grande : No
3.0,The fasteners broke easily and the bra didn't give me much support. Wouldn't recommend if you're really busty.
3.0,Good quality. Loos the t shirt. And the design. But the size medium is aprox 2 inch smaller than all other standard Medium size. I usually buy Medium. Buy this one is too tight for me.
3.0,the package was open and wrinkled like it had been used and put back. Not as soft as it looked. kinda feeling like I should go find another one and return this one.
3.0,"After waiting 3 weeks I was really excited to get this shirt as I am a huge GOT fan... The shirt is nice, a bitbon the smaller side, however the Rios of the wings are cut off. It seems like the shirt was folded when the print was done."
3.0,"While the visor itself does a good job of blocking the sun from your entire face including the sides of your face (cheeks, jaw, & chin),  the band<br />that goes on your head is unusually stiff & weird shaped making it too tight in some places & gaps in other places.  Additionally, the weight of the entire garment was too heavy.  Those two combined I got a headache after a while of wearing it."
3.0,Love it but glitter is wearing off
3.0,Too big but the biggest problem I have is the seams around the shirt don't sit flat enough. It has no tag so this tells me it is poorly produced. Can't tell what size I actually got because it's not marked anywhere.
3.0,"This is cute but I returned due to the size. It is very small, it would not hold any card size items- not a license or card holder, only for coins or similar."
3.0,"The black parts fell out as soon as I took them out of the package. Don't buy.<br /><br />Edit: included a photo of cufflinks to show how they fell out, in response to the customer service representative comment below. Basically, they look like there wasn't any glue at all. They fell out as soon as I took them out of the packaging.<br /><br />Edit #2: the manufacturer sent me a second set of these. The black parts on my second set didn't fall out."
3.0,"The fabric was a tee shirt knit material, definitely not a sweater.  I returned it due to the fabric.  The color and fit was fine."
3.0,"Cute, but the sleeves are too short for me. 5'6&#34; 160 - ordered a Large. Should have gone XL, maybe."
3.0,"Great watch, but the small pin that connects the watch to the band fell out without strenuous activity. The wristband itself also is cheap and uncomfortable. But the time keeper itself is very nice"
3.0,"The bag is not royal blue as pictured and described, it is a very dark navy blue with brown zippers and strap. Bag is okay, but dislike the color."
3.0,"It looks okay, runs small. Had to return."
3.0,this ok
3.0,"Lightweight and cute, but super slick soles, so your kid will go sliding across any smooth surfaces."
3.0,"Thes run very small.  Even stretchy they were uncomfortable.  Soft material and cute.  My sister will be happy.  We both have RA and Fibro and have been looking for comfortable solutions to reg bras.  I had ordrered extra larges. I normally wear large tops and wanted the extra give, anything tight bothers me."
3.0,Good shirt. Thick material. It does not breath great. Wish it was cheaper in price but still very happy with purchase.
3.0,Cute but cheaply made and poorly designed! My 5years old loves it
3.0,Fit more like a 7. Still the best flip flop on the planet!!! So now I have a complaint on this one...THEY SQUEAK!!! This is the first Reef flip flop EVER that I've had that do that...so annoying...I will speak with seller...bummer
3.0,Good for some one who like tight fittings
3.0,Nice material.  Runs big so I just will wear around house.
3.0,Drive Safely!! If the grammar was correct I'd buy this for my daughter.
3.0,At the top it has an elastic band and the bow tie is simply seen on its not a wrap and it's not a drawstring the bow is just decoration. I'm not a fan of the elastic at all. The shape of the dress is pretty and the length is good. The material is not so see through that my husband hated it yet but in the summer I know I will have to wear shorts under it unfortunately. Just going up stairs outside to my apartment at dusk I knew I could see threw it. I chose to keep it because the pattern and cut and length is flattering. This company is making money off this skirt so don't think your getting more quality than that. It's not authentic looking it's thin material and what seems as mass produced clothing that you would find cheaply.
3.0,These pants are very very small only reason I didn’t send it back was because the button down and the sweater fits well
3.0,Pretty cheesy. Polyester look and cheap feel. would not buy again.
3.0,This dress is a house dress. The material is comfortable but It's not flattering on the body no matter what size you are.
3.0,"I felt this shirt ran small. It’s not very soft, the material looks a little cheap as do the buttons. Material is on the thin side as well."
3.0,Love to bright yellow color and the capped sleeves.  It fits as expected.
3.0,"The eyeballs can dent very easily, worked perfect as prizes for the kids though."
3.0,My 5 year old daughter loves this jacket. I was disappointed that the fleece only lines the chest/body of the coat. It is nice that the hood detaches but we are constantly reattaching it because the button holds are too big.
3.0,The dress looks nice however the fabrics is much like a parachute. It’s crisp nylon feeling. Not the best for a summer dress.
3.0,"They are super cute, fit good in the legs but big in the waist."
3.0,"Good product,  fast shipping"
3.0,"Material isn’t very thick or compressing. While I didn’t mind the black shirt, the white and gray were made out of a different satiny fabric that kept sliding up my workout pants. I liked how they fit and the length was nice but not very great to workout in."
3.0,"very disappointed, not as pictured"
3.0,These shirts run large. I would recommend you size down. Also the sleeves are very long.
3.0,The size 6 is the same size as the 5T!!!<br />Not happy about this.  I had to return and re-order once already.<br />3 stars because they are adorable!!
3.0,"This is pretty,  but one of the pieces broke off immediately.  The metal is very cheap, although it looks nice."
3.0,Thin material yet it doubles so it is bulky.
3.0,Needs chest pockets
3.0,"These smell like salad dressing. They work fine, I’ve only user them once though because I can’t get past the smell. My comfort rating is including the smell, because while the gloves fit nicely, the smell makes me uncomfortable."
3.0,"This is really cute, but super thin and wispy. It looks like it is too thin, like you washed it and it got eaten in the dryer. I still use it because it is light and travels well, but it is not a favorite. I would rather have a longer one that I can more easily wrap. Also, the material is kind of scratchy. It doesn't wrinkle though, so again I deal with it."
3.0,The fabric is much heavier than the other DryTec offerings.
3.0,"It's got a cheap, poorly made design. Makes my G chest look minimal and my waistline big😔"
3.0,I loved this skirt so much! It's super comfy and perfect for the summer. But it ripped after about 3 times wearing
3.0,Shirt was short
3.0,very thin fabric  tight around the chest area
3.0,Keeps a lot of lint
3.0,"I really wanted to like this top. The style and fabric are great, but the size just isn't right. I ordered the Medium E and there is just no way that is an E cup. I would say it was closer to a C, maybe a small D. It's a shame because the band fit fine and the material is really soft and nice."
3.0,"Very nice material and length, but it runs a size small."
3.0,Not as long as photo shows
3.0,"Very pretty but waaay too big!  Also too long.<br />I'm 5'4 120 lb, so I ordered a small, but it hangs on me like a large, not even a medium. Would recommend for larger girls as it does complement an hourglass figure well. Still undecided but will probably return."
3.0,"I've only worn these a few times, but they seem to slip off my ears.  I've adjusted them so that they aren't as wide and that doesn't really help.  Hopefully, as I wear them more, I can figure out how to keep them from slipping."
3.0,Good for it's price.  I ended up not using it since I didnt need it after all.
3.0,"Great graphic, big neck hole<br />Literally won't wear it due to giant neck opening<br />Howard would be like wtf?"
3.0,"The tools provided were very useful, the instruction were just okay. The biggest problem I had was trying to determine the correct amount of links to take out. Do I have to take out the same number of links on each side of the clasp? Can I have a different number of links on either side of the clasp?<br />The pins to hold the links together, looks so much a like on both ends. If you are not careful and you put the wrong end of the pin down, it is extremely hard to get the pin out. And no tool is provide to extract the pin, if the pin is inserted incorrectly.<br />The unit over all looks strong and has a nice feel/weight to it and I think it looks good."
3.0,Nice studs to have in your collection. Would pair nicely with some sterling silver diamond cut small hoop earrings.
3.0,A little too bulky but cute
3.0,This is a cute bracelet but string is very thin. I am afraid of losing it. Will probably restring it with stronger material.
3.0,"Fits great in the bust area, but loses the boulson effect if you have long torso"
3.0,Nicely made well constructed pant Much smaller than expected. Not true to size
3.0,the necklace was not shiny new looking when I received it.
3.0,"It's a little bigger than expected and the material feels a little cheap, other than those two concerns it's not too bad for it's price :)"
3.0,Cute design for a key ring.  A little large to wear as a bangle/bracelet
3.0,"Item is very cute, but it is cut very small. I am normally a size 14 and it is very tight on me. I think I need to lose 15 pounds."
3.0,Doesn't look as advertised and was very loose
3.0,Very pretty bag. It is sturdy and keeps food cold. It is just a few inches two small for what I like to pack for lunch.
3.0,I sent this back. I am 5 ft 4 inches and 145 pounds. I ordered a large and was too small. Sent it back.
3.0,"Either people are getting bigger or someone can't figure out what a medium is. Shoulders on the medium span 44 inches. Chest sits at 46. Baggy as can be, but might make a good Superman cape."
3.0,No support. More like a tank top only shorter
3.0,"What I like: Symbolize, Colors, Decoration, Gem, Rhinestones<br />What I didn't like: The Chain"
3.0,"Absolutely loved this upon arrival.  So much so I didn’t wash it (which is unusual for me).  Washed up great the first wash.  By the third wash, material is what I call “scratchy” and “catching”.  It didn’t flow and feel soft.  It didn’t shrink, but if I so much as have a hang nail, it will catch in the material.  Lots of piling also (small little balls of materials that form all over the fabric).  If you are looking for something that retains its size, this is it.  If you are looking for continued softness, not so much."
3.0,"This item was absolutely beautiful, great quality, but not made for larger chest sizes. Fit everywhere except the chest. Any chance custom clothes are offered?"
3.0,Shape is not as pictured. Seems form fitted.... Well.... it is a short square. I'll still ware it but I was disappointed.
3.0,"I like these joggers, they are really soft, but a bit too small for what I needed. I gave them to somebody else hoping they can wear them."
3.0,Dress is adorable but not a woman's dress I read the reviews before I ordered and purchased it for my 11 year old daughter. She loves it.
3.0,"The jacket was a bit smaller than expected.  However, the most frustrating part was the smell.  We washed it four times before we got the smell out."
3.0,very pretty but one earring broke within 4 hours.
3.0,"I'm petite and the length was above my knee, sleeves were a bit on the long side.  Overall fit was lose and comfy.The negative--as one reviewer posted, you can feel the stitching prickling the skin on the top part that sits on chest. I hope this will be resolved after a gentle wash."
3.0,I was so excited to get this but then was a little sad that it only had 107 beads and not the 108 beads. I was planning to use this for meditation. It is very pretty I am just missing a bead.
3.0,It was not as good as I thought it would be. Not good with the finish.
3.0,It is nice but hard to get off and does not look like photo
3.0,Thick socks and grip is good on first use; unfortunately turned these inside out and washed on cold and the rubber gripping came off. Not totally- but still chunks were rubbed off pretty quickly.
3.0,Tapers were fine. I just didn't like the tunnels with the screw on backs. They pinch my skin on my ear which is already tender... But all in all not bad for $8
3.0,"Beautiful fabric, quality shirt...sizing WAY off- mush smaller than labeled."
3.0,"Great for what I needed (the sleeves) but don’t expect ANY support for your girls. It’s just fabric there . Fit me great . Size M , 5’7” 170lbs"
3.0,Band broke same day I received it. But watch works good
3.0,"I bought these for my husband. Only one pair fit him, but just ok. The other pair didn't stretch enough to go over his heal. Most of the sock stretched fine, but part of the design did not. They are just a little big on me, though, so I'll wear them around the house. I was disappointed they didn't fit my husband well."
3.0,"They are nice, but they dont frame my face quite like I thought they would. Regarless, I am happy with my order"
3.0,"These are not stone. I have had my ears stretched for six years, and I tend to wear stone or metal for how easy it is to clean. These don't feel like stone (almost feel plastic-y,, not the same weight as stone and if you run a fingernail over them it feels like you're scratching into the surface lightly) so I imagine they don't have the same nonporous properties many of us are looking for in stone earrings. They do give off a very odd melted plastic smell if you wear the same ones for a bit, even when regularly cared for. I've never had these problems from real stone. They're still pretty, just as pictured, but I only really wear the clear and sandstone ones as the others feel and smell offputting. I wouldn't ever buy them again."
3.0,"The dimensions are all correct, but it is very easy to brush against my body or another surface and come unsnapped."
3.0,"At first, putting it on over my shoulders made me look like the hunchback of Notre dame, and I couldn't zip it up past my waist. After stretching it up from my ankles (which doesnt work too quickly with this material) I was able to stand mostly erect. Zipping it up myself it, the zipper would slide back down on its own. Then, after obtaining my husbands help, we were able to get it zipped up to just below the collar, and i could move in it. Although, when then unzipping it after trying it on, the zipper grabbed onto everything it could. Be careful and pull the fabric away from your skin or whatever you're wearing underneath before unzipping. Its the type of material that should fit better if you break it in, if you can get it on initially. One size fits all, but not that well. I was really pushing it at my size."
3.0,"bought this as a Halloween costume i went as glen from the walking dead. i poured fake blood on it and i didnt care because of how cheap this shirt was. i would not recommend this shirt if you are planning on wearing it for more then one or 2 times. the stitching is pretty poor, but if you need a cheap costume and your asian. thats what i did."
3.0,Fit small. I gave it away.
3.0,"Came on time, and mostly what it should be. I own the uwatch 3s and this product says it will fit the 3s the pins did not. I had to use the pins that came in the original straps to get it to fit and there is a good amount of play at the connection of the watch and strap because of this. Material feels a little stiff but not bad. Fit is probably best for small to medium sized womens wrists I feel like a larger wrist would be uncomfortable."
3.0,It was a little too big. I bought a large and I'm a 38 DD. It was swallowing me up. So I returned it.
3.0,Cute exactly as you see it. Nicely made
3.0,I was very disappointed. It's very cheaply made.
3.0,Arm length is way too small for my liking. I’m an over sized kinda girl. Deff size up for arm length
3.0,"Like other reviewers mentioned, these run at least a size or 2 small. Even with the correct fit, the sleeves were short.  Cute though. Will be good for under my scrubs tops and for running in cooler months"
3.0,One of the shoes came apart and I only had them for about 3 months. They are NOT<br />very strong at all!
3.0,"The pin remover itself is pretty good quality,as it is all metal could scratch your watch on it. The free pins supplied are very soft, all 3 have bent after adjusting 3 watches and that is with applying only very slight force. Is cheap for a reason."
3.0,Says 9 cards more like 6
3.0,"quality material, but too fitted, purchased 2 had to return them."
3.0,cool style but broke in a few months.
3.0,I would love these shorts BUT the top of my underwear ends up showing when I’m riding.<br />These will only be used for indoor at home cycling.
3.0,Does an ok job and removing smells but way too small for shoes
3.0,Cute but material worse than I thought
3.0,Not fitting well on my ear
3.0,This would be a 5 star.. but there is a discoloration on one of the shirts print .. the little mermaid .the red is damaged
3.0,"The fabric on this is very thin. It is almost see thru, so I recommend wearing a slip or boy shorts. It is also running small. I purchased mine for work but ended up returning it due to the quality of the material."
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, I bought it for my wife and when she tried it on, it looked good on her but she will need to wear a cami to cover the huge gap in the front."
3.0,The socks are fine.  My beef is with the presentation of what was included - there was this circle above the picture of the socks that said &#34;3 count&#34; with &#34;3&#34; in a big bold number.  This tells me there are 3 pairs of socks.  There aren't.  One pair.  I believe this was intentionally deceptive and would like to know if anyone else made this purchase believing they were getting 3 pairs.  I don't know whether to blame Drymax or Active Life Store - right now I'm blaming both and will make my future purchases accordingly.
3.0,It fit as expected and the color was pretty but it looked a little too cheap for me to want to keep.
3.0,not what I expected for the price
3.0,Very nice bag but sling way too short. Cant carry with sling
3.0,Dug into heels
3.0,My girlfriend found there is not a place for the shoulder leash (what ever it's called) to clip to the bag. We looked all over. Nice bag though
3.0,"This metal guard helps to keep a ring from falling off. It may be tricky to install, since the ends have to be crimped around the ring that is being protected from loss."
3.0,"It's more bulky than I'm use to, however it has drawn compliments on occasion. The leather band is very stiff and I found difficult to use, therefore I purchased an expansion band and installed it, hence solved the problem. I will look for a slimmer watch next time."
3.0,"I'm a huge Snoopy fan.  I was so excited to see this lanyard that matched a zippered Snoopy badge holder I found elsewhere.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I discovered that the ""hook"" hit right at the most embarrassingly obtrusive part of my body instead of hanging between the girls and dangling a little under my chest.<br /><br />The Snoopy plastic charm was adorable and I moved it to a different lanyard that I used instead."
3.0,"Like the concept, runs very small! Have to send it back"
3.0,"my cell phone, ID and credit card fit into this, but there was no extra space to fit anything else.  Since I was traveling outside of the country, extra space would be best if wanting to use it as a wrist-let.  I probably would not buy again."
3.0,good for work
3.0,It was smaller than I would have liked to use as a beach cover up so I returned it.
3.0,"Quality tie, but length is not extra long. Measures noticeably less than the 63&#34; provided in description"
3.0,"Beautiful dress, fabric didn't have enough stretch for me"
3.0,"I Lost my Apple Watch Series 5 in the water, the band broken and I lost in the SEA!"
3.0,Bought this for my daughter.  It &#34;fits&#34; but is too tight but the quality and fabric was really nice so I am ordering the next size up.
3.0,It would be a nice party dress if it fit. I'm a small/Xsmall and it was way too big.
3.0,This is a HARD purse. Not giving and will not lose the shape. I store my laptop in here but wish it had a little flex. It's almost impervious
3.0,I liked the bag it was just a little heavy for me.
3.0,"It's pretty good quality for the price, and it shipped fine. But it was WAY too small for my head."
3.0,Runs small. Order a size up from your normal.
3.0,"These shoes seem to be comfortable for my toddler and they are true to size.  However, the quality is pretty low.  THe front of the toe is already wearing away after just a few wears.  She does tend to wear the toes of her shoes easily, but she has only worn these a few times.  I wouldn't buy again."
3.0,"It’s ok, looks just like the pic, fabric is nice...only think I don’t love is that it fits pretty much like a man’s shirt."
3.0,The gold metallic is not gold at all but an orange color that is not flattering. The legs are high cut so it does not cover your butt. The fit was slightly smaller than the sizing chart.
3.0,"bought it for my daughter, it fits her well"
3.0,"Poor quality material, very thin"
3.0,A little bigger than I would have wanted. Very flowy. May try to belt it.
3.0,Really really pretty charm really really small n it's not a stopper for other charms it doesn't stay in place it turns n moves all around
3.0,"The quality is OK. In the seam the stripes do not lineup, so sewing is off unless that is the style now.  Although, I like the feel of the fabric, but the horizontal stripes make me look bigger than I am.  The fabric is light, so I wear it at home. But, I don't wear it out much because it makes me look bigger than I am."
3.0,The strap broke the first time it was used
3.0,"Ordered these and they were way bigger than I anticipated. Good quality and durable, just bigger than I thought they would be"
3.0,"Ordered for my wife. Her comments: Okay looking for as small as they are. Comfortable, hang securely and lightweight. After reading prior reviews, and also taking into account pics shown online, I had to wonder why the ones I received could be so underwhelming. I feel the pro photography involved for the online ad was done very well, enhancing detail that quite frankly the naked eye just isn’t going to see in real life - not even close. Even the pics I took when enlarged are way more flattering than these are when actually being worn.<br /><br />- The cheap presentation box included came apart at the hinge on 3rd opening.<br />- They weigh in at 4 grams or .1 ounces on my scale.<br /><br />I wouldn’t wear these out and expect anyone to notice them. The center stone, which is actually quite flat on its surface, will have to catch light at a very rare angle to look anything other than flat and dull. All of the smaller stones are way too small to stand out, even up close, in good light, with my 2.5 power readers on. For me, these will go to the back of my jewelry drawer.  To be honest, I would not feel good about gifting these, except as a cheap stocking stuffer gift item so as not to insult the recipient.  While cute, they do look cheap."
3.0,Should not be worn without shorts. These feel too thin to be comfortable to wear alone and you'd see through them otherwise.
3.0,"This is a pretty little necklace that was bought for my daughter's birthday. She loved it. It was delivered right on time. Thanks<br /><br />Update: this necklace is VERY cheaply made. The rose fell off right after she got it. I still left 3 stars, as the design is still pretty, but needs the maker to take pride in his/her work."
3.0,The sizing is odd. When ordering up it is too large and when ordering down it’s still large and bulky. But it’s such a cool product.
3.0,"This cardigan is cute but the material is a little itchy. It should be okay to wear with long sleeves, so I still plan to wear it this winter. It fits true to size as well."
3.0,"Edited to add: Unfortunately this sweater disintegrated in the wash (see picture) so I have downgraded my review as it is now in the trash. I wash sweaters regularly in the machine on delicate and never had one fall apart this badly. I would recommend maybe just hand washing.<br /><br />--------------------<br />I would follow the size chart here, as in, actually measure your body. I am 5'3"" & 30J/38-33-38 and ordered Black in Large. I'm very happy with the fit, it's very comfortable on a adult-proportioned body and not as baby-sized as it appears. Sleeve length is excellent, I have long arms and prefer 'sweater paws' length sleeves. Everything is slim-looking while being very comfortable and stretchy. It covers my large chest while still having a cute gap there in the middle for the bow ties. This item is supposed to be open in the front and show off the strings.<br /><br />The sweater is thin but excellent quality, it looks good and feels quite soft. Doesn't seem like it would get damaged easily.<br /><br />The sweater cut does look cuter over a dress than with pants, IMO. Overall a superb throwback item, great to add some light warmth to your arms or cover up a armhole gap on a dress. Honestly probably a better quality than anything I actually wore in the 90s."
3.0,"I hoped the material would be a little softer and more flexible,but well made otherwise.Better than what you'd get at a state or independant  facility."
3.0,"Really wanted to like this dress, but the color was off.  It showed white but was more cream colored."
3.0,A little too thin for my taste. Hold it up to the light and you say see right through it. Nice design though with the front pockets. Good for when the weather is hot.
3.0,"I really liked this bonnet until it stained my pillowcases even after washing it. It even stained my chair fabric. If purchasing this, only get LIGHT colors DO NOT GET THE BLACK unless you have black sheets"
3.0,"It was way too small for me, but luckily I have a 12-year-old daughter that it fits just perfectly! Size runs EXTREMELY SMALL, but the dress is very cute and she loves wearing it to church!"
3.0,"While the dress came at the size I expected, the fabric was incredibly thin and showed every line, both on my body and my underclothes. I may try to wear it with Spanx, or find something a little less clingy (or thicker fabric)."
3.0,"I wish these were better quality. The ball isn't that shiny and it's borderline cheap looking. I got these as my daughter wanted them. I've seen these earrings (style) at other stores and they look shiny and just all around better. $15.99 isn't that cheap for earrings, is it?"
3.0,"I like the design, color, and material as it came exactly as I wanted. Except for the size that is. Some of the  comments says it fits  2year olds and so I bought it. The pcture seems smal too but when I got it, it was teen-adult size."
3.0,A bit bigger than I had expected. Not a light silver.
3.0,"These look exactly like pictured which is nice, but the inside seem feels like it was sewn funny. It feels oddly tight at those seems. Other than that, these are fine"
3.0,These are cute and would make a cool gift for a dog lover. But there is no way they are ever going to fit on a standard male's foot because my size 10 tootsies give them a run for their money.
3.0,"Very thin,silky fabric,but company was quick to respond and provide a partial return."
3.0,"Smaller than I expected, and the fur is pretty matted. I'm going to try to fluff it though a bit. Will work excellent for my niece's Alice in Wonderland themed birthday party."
3.0,"This ring is so much more than I could have expected. I checked reviews and decided to purchase even though the price seemed WAY too low for great quality. I was totally wrong. This ring is a beauty. It's incredible quality and so unique and eye-catching with the Koa wood. I have seen similar rings for upwards of $100, so this is a steal of a deal! You won't be disappointed. I purchased this one as a gift, but I intend to buy one for myself now that I've seen & felt it. This is an A+ purchase, definitely wedding band quality, & anyone would be happy to receive it!<br />EDITED TO ADD: The test of time has not been great for this ring. It is still very nice looking & wearable, but it has some very visible signs of wear. This doesn't seem to be genuine tungsten carbide. It scratches very easily. Still love the ring, but there is a lot of obvious wear after 10 or so months."
3.0,The pink dress is closer to orange and the v neck not so much. Pattern was way more darker on one side. It does fit perfectly and is very comfortable.
3.0,Mask is so tiny maybe for a kid not for an adult.
3.0,It's huge. Doesn't look good on a Pandora bracelet. The finish is different. It's nice maybe alone on a necklace
3.0,"Nice watch, very stylish"
3.0,The skirt is nice but ended up not like the draw strings on the side but I bought it for 4th of July golf tourney and the colors were not red they were orange.  I was disappointed and the fit on this skirt isn’t as nice as a previous one I purchased.
3.0,Product is very difficult to put on and felt uncomfortable for long time use.
3.0,Photo is not a clear as in product photo
3.0,Bottom seems started coming apart after the first couple of washes.
3.0,"Thin, not protective at all."
3.0,"I found the item to be pricey for it, furthermore I was very disappointed by the fact that for the price it did not even have a gifting bag, but came on a cardboard inside a clear bag!"
3.0,Very cute dress for the price. Only issue is the top falls open
3.0,Legs smaller
3.0,"The little bands in the front are a pain, but this is a good suit for the price. The color is gorgeous. Definitely size up."
3.0,"Waist is super small, so I ended up giving to one of my friends."
3.0,"I used this on regular tennis shoes and they work good, but the magnet breaks open when I used them on a set of boots.  Probably should have purchased the stronger one for boots."
3.0,"Nice dress, very comfortable, however, the picture shows that it is an ankle length dress and the one that came to me is a high-low dress. It still works but I don't know if I would have purchased it if I had known this fact."
3.0,Good but not long enough to hide tummy spillover
3.0,Really nice swimsuit. Material was good quality. But the bust area is not for anyone who has much on the top! I was sorry it didn't fit.
3.0,This is cute I did have bunching at the stomach area for my shape it wasn't as flattering as other bathing suits so I decided to wear it with shorts. Know your body! If you are lean and straight up and down this is for you. If you are curvy pass on this one
3.0,"Very comfortable.  True to fit.  I have had problems with the purple bra zipper going off track and coming open during wear.  The black one, which I wear more often, does not seem to have this problem."
3.0,Nices gloves they fit pretty well when I got them but after wearing them for a while they have stretched out.
3.0,"They are good looking, and could wear them around , instead of shoes. But, they were too small"
3.0,Super cute shoe but very stiff.
3.0,Nice dress but it's more of a cherry red instead of desired merlot.
3.0,"Really cute top, just a little small. I think a medium would have been better. I am 5,4 and 130 and I thought the small was too small. But I liked the colors and the pocket!"
3.0,It is kind of so so for me. It is pretty an looks as described. The netting shows through in places and the hair is thinner than I would like. The bangs were so long I had to cut them
3.0,Cool hat but the quality of the hat is very cheap. Flea market hat and they just had a fancy shmancy  embroidery for the writing
3.0,My sisters broke after just a few days of use. Mine is fine. She's going to try and fix it. It was the only keychain on her ring. She put it on after she got her new truck. So disappointed that that happened. I really hope she can fix it!
3.0,Uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time
3.0,I like the looks of them but wish they were a little larger. I wear anywhere from a 4/6 in clothing but found them a little too snug for my liking.
3.0,I ordered a size fourteen based on reviews and it is too big. It is a light weight fabric though not see through I like the style I'll keep it and have it altered.
3.0,"cheap material, but comfortable"
3.0,"I liked this suit and the fit was fine. However, the bottom only has lining in the front and the back of the bottom is much too thin. I'm 5'4&#34; so the top pretty much covers the whole bottom but I just don't think it will last. If I had paid less I would but another bottom but for the price I won't be doing that."
3.0,"I love that they come in such a large pack as my rings always break, some of the colors are cute but you dont get to pick them. They dont break and are the right length and are good for everyday use."
3.0,The dress was too small but it's really cute
3.0,I am returning these. The felt tight and high waisted but I was not fond of the feel at all. It felt like a rough nail would snag them.  They really didn't have much give either. I would say people are stretching big time saying it was lululemon
3.0,I got this for my girl and the engraving Was for a man
3.0,The non skid part is on both sides of the socks which is nice but they are very thin and haven’t held up well with multiple washings. Too expensive for what you get.
3.0,"I have tried skin color underwear, it's still shown the whole color. Tried throng, it's showing the black gap between the butts. Only get the white color if you want to play sexy game with you gf/husband, it’s way too embarrassing to wear it out for workout……."
3.0,"These shoes are precious.  However, my daughter has such a small and narrow foot that they were a little too wide for her.  I ended up returning them."
3.0,"My daughter says the gift to her child,my grandchild,is scratchy--not soft."
3.0,I do love this shirt but it runs big so order a size down.
3.0,"I have been using this belt for a couple weeks now. It is definitely stiff. Not very supple. Kind of a good thing if you are going to use it to hold a holster/handgun. I have not tried it yet for carry purposes. I have a 35"" waist and ordered the 32""-38"" size. As you can see from the first two photos, the belt was 45.5"" in length. It was way too long to stay within my first belt buckle. So, it had to be trimmed. If you need to trim the belt, trim it on the buckle side. Photo #3 shows the backside of the buckle with the lever closed. Open that lever as shown in photo #4 and that end of the belt comes off the buckle. I tried to cut the belt with some Henckel's kitchen scissors and they were barely cutting through it. So, I ended up using a utility knife and that made a smooth cut through it. Not sure I would change anything about this belt, but for some reason I just do not like it as much as my ratcheting ""dress"" belt. That is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />Edit (4/23/2023): The buckle broke on my other ratchet belt, so I have been using this one a lot over the past couple of weeks. I am not happy with how it holds in place, or actually does not hold in place. The strap is so rigid/hard that the belt buckle does not get a decent bite into the strap to keep it in place. Sometimes, while bending over, the belt will loosen up."
3.0,"The screen decal was rubbed off on spots.  The caps are quality products, but the printing is not the best quality."
3.0,"The material is nice and comfortable. The bust support is good. The band rolls and feels like a rubber band on my chest, like every other bra I've tried in 60 years of being a full-grown woman. I would return it, but shipping is half the cost of the bra, so I will keep it and hope I can stretch it out. For perspective, I am a very medium-sized woman...5'6"" 130#, chest below bust 35"" and barely a B cup. I ordered a Large, and it is too tight."
3.0,I was so excited about this skirt based off the stock photo. But The pockets make the hip area really bulky and so unflattering
3.0,Chain was a little thicker than what I expected so it kinks easily.
3.0,"Beautiful but way too big. Very thick weight sweater, but I could easily see it catching or pilling with repeat wash"
3.0,"Love the design and how the bottoms fit. The top is where I had a problem. I wear roughly a 38DD-40DDD depending on what brand the bra is. This top was just big enough where I could get away with wearing it for lounging around, but If I tried to swim...forget about it. I got a 5x (I wear a US 16, am 5'6, and weigh 200 lb.) and still it wasnt big enough on top. If you're big busted, I would got up a size, unfortunate that wasn't an option for me."
3.0,"The brown leather band was perfect size, the strings attached were smaller so they didn't fit around my wrist so there is an awkward lump between the brown band and string tied to it due to them being too small."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01DIW1DJ8 Besteel Jewelry Mens Leather Wrap Bracelet for Men Cuff Punk Rock Adjustable Black 7-9 Inch]] Received this bracelet ahead of the estimated arrival date, which was a nice surprise. The bracelet came in a small black pouch, suitable for gift giving for sure, but of a size that meant the bracelet had to be folded in thirds to fit inside. In its travels, the thin straps were all turned inside out, and since they are lighter on the back that didn't work at all. So although it arrived early, it has spent several days under a weight to flatten out in the right direction. I wouldn't mention this at all but for the fact that the pouch was shipped in a large 10&#34; x 15&#34; padded envelope -- so it could have been shipped flat and might have arrived in wearable condition. A thought for the manufacturer.<br />While it may be 100% leather, the body of the bracelet has been bonded to some sort of backing -- it is not suede against the wrist, which is what I expected in a leather bracelet. Whatever that bonding on the back it, it has a strange odor. Which meant that after the bracelet flattened out in the right direction, I left it out on the patio to air out the smell. That said, the back side of the bracelet is actually very comfortable, and all snaps and rivets are nicely finished so as to be comfortable against the wrist.<br />There are three adjustments possible with the different closure snaps: 7&#34;, just under 8&#34; and 8.75&#34; so it really is a unisex piece and will fit most men and women. My husband wore it today and got several compliments; I wore it yesterday and the same thing happened. I found it uncomfortable as the day's temperature increased; it doesn't seem to breathe the way leather does, which again I think is about the strange backing.<br />Overall, I'd be happier with a bracelet that felt like leather on both sides, which is why I gave this one only three stars. I received this item at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Would like but straps do not adjust! They are way too stretchy and long to give any support.
3.0,eh...it came in the weirdest shape and the fur was all in differnt directions. doesnt look like the picture at all....
3.0,"I was surprised at first glance, at how well made these appeared given how inexpensive they are. The frames are sturdy, and the hinges are solid with a little bit of flex, enough that the arms won't snap off if accidentally bent a bit.<br /><br />As good as they look off of me is how bad as they look on me. It's not that the glasses are ugly, I like the way that they look that's why I chose them. But once they're on my face it becomes obvious that the size and shape are not compatible with my size and shape face.<br /><br />Still, no one sees me staring at my computer screen at night, so I gave them a try. Do they work? The jury is out on that question. Personally, I saw no difference at all. I can't say it's because these glasses don't work, since I never had a different pair to compare against, or is It simply that the whole ""blue-blocking"" concept is not what it is hyped up to be. Regardless, I'll wear them for a few more nights, but I'm not optimistic.<br /><br />If you want to give them a shot, to see if perhaps the light-blocking effect will for you, these are a reasonable way to experiment. They're inexpensive, they come in a decent carrying case with cloth and mini-screwdriver, and who knows, they may be perfect for your size and shape face.<br /><br />Review of: ANDOILT Blue Light Blocking Glasses for Women Men"
3.0,Purchased for my son. He’s normally a medium but I bought a small. It was still too big but it did the job
3.0,"GOOD FIT, GTREAT COLOR AND DESIGN.  MATERIAL THINNER THAN I EXPECTED FOR A &#34;CARGO&#34; SHORT. SHORTS TORE AFTER I HAD WASHED ONE TIME NEXT TO THE REAR PCOKET SEAM. MATERIAL, NOT SEAM! JSUT SPLIT. HENCE WAY TO THIN OF MATERIAL..! I REPAIRED VS. DOING A RETURN... HMMM... WE'LL SEE HOW LONG IT LAST THEN POSSIBLE RETURN.."
3.0,"I'm usually a medium, but when I tried it didn't fit as expected."
3.0,It fit great everywhere but in my chest. I was so disappointed. This suit is so pretty and flattering.
3.0,The tags are great and sturdy and really made it easy to find our bags. The little attachment thingies kept coming loose despite screwing them closed tightly. There’s probably a better method.
3.0,I got a medium and these leggings were too short and too wide for my body type. Didn't fit as I expected them too.
3.0,What is the case diameter mm??
3.0,"its nice,but it runs small,szL like S"
3.0,Very pretty. Deep pockets which is nice. Poor workmanship because the seams on my shoulders began fraying after the first wash.
3.0,It was shipped quickly. The dress is not as brightly colored as the picture. The material isn’t silky or light so it doesn’t really flow or move. We ordered a large for my daughter who is 5’7 about 155lbs and it is a bit large in the waist and top. We will keep it and get it to a tailor but I don’t think I’ll order another one
3.0,Best suited for a child between the ages of 5 and 7 years old. Cute designs. Quality seems acceptable but i have not washed them yet as they are way too big for my child.
3.0,"The material is good however, fits small and flattens my chest."
3.0,"Difficult to put on, but once on they did not feel too tight and there was no discomfort in wearing them all day. These were of very thick material with limited &#34;stretch&#34;--quite unlike the &#34;World's Softest&#34; that I'd received in all my previous orders, I have no idea whether these are some sort of &#34;new&#34; version, fake, or what. I much prefer the earlier version, but I don't know if they are available anymore."
3.0,"Love the dark green color.  Quality is good but not as soft or details as refined as I had hoped, but the &#34;price us right&#34;!"
3.0,The bi-focal should be clear to allow user to see the dash.
3.0,"The good: it looks very nice.  The less good: it would be nice to have instructions.  I'm sure there's a better and a worse direction to attach it: does the part with the clip go on the near side as the watch sits on your wrist, or the far side?  I have it set so the clip is on the near side, meaning it opens away from me.  I *think* that's easier than the reverse, but it was hard enough go get it attached to the watch that I don't want to take it apart and try it the other way.<br /><br />Update: not quite a year later, I fell running and one of the pins popped out of the latch part.  I replaced it with another pin, but apparently it's a different diameter, as the latch won't close.  So no good anymore.<br /><br />I have a small wrist, but it works ok; lots of strap left over, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.  If you have a very large wrist, you might want to look for a longer one, I'm not sure.<br /><br />FWIW, the spring bars are not included (and to their credit, the seller's description is very up front about that), so save the ones off your old band (or buy a pair).  I've taken spring bars off and put them back on before; for some reason it was harder this time, but maybe I'm getting old and clumsy.  In the process, the small bar (not spring loaded) that's part of the clip came off.  I was working on a large clean surface, so it was easy to find and (almost) easy to replace, but have a look at the clip before you start working on things, so you know where it goes.  I doubt the clip would work without it.<br /><br />Length adjustment is quite easy--they describe a special tool, but any very small flat bladed screw driver should suffice.<br /><br />I've taken it off and put it back on several times (metal detectors...), and it can be tricky to get the clasp to stay.  I had it fall off once when I thought it was secure."
3.0,It's a cheap knock-off of the Mud Pie version. There were loose strings on the shirt and my skirt didn't have a bow. A little disappointed but ok for the price.
3.0,"That’s nice, but it’s not true my size"
3.0,"Me gusto el diseño del ojo en grande pero esperaba qué se viera más como la foto de muestra , demasiado caro 11.99 cuando parece de las qué encuentras a menos precio asta por 1 dólar..."
3.0,Didn’t like the fuzzy balls wanted stones for oil
3.0,"I like this nightshirt, but I was disappointed that the fabric is NOT soft. I thought the flannel would be cozy and snuggly and warm, but this isn’t. It feels “stiff” even after washing. Too bad..."
3.0,"Really loved this belt when I got it, then the belt material started to tear apart.  It broke on me at a very inconvenient time.  Great idea, cheaply made."
3.0,Cheap but cute I guess. Didn’t even come with real backs.. came with rubber stoppers. The ring connecting the upper and lower piece broke after two wears which I was able to fix with a jewelry repair kit. Annoying but you get what you pay for.
3.0,"I want to like and keep this dress, but I just don't know. The material is so strange and shiny. It kind of feels like a swimsuit cover. It has pockets, which is great and the sleeves are adorable. The fabric is a good weight and makes the dress hang nicely. I might return based completely on the shininess of the material."
3.0,"Site said to order regular size, but too tight. Arms too long. Cuffs too wide."
3.0,This was an XS and it was sooooo big! But for the costume it worked! I cut the feet off.  But def will west again on a snow day!
3.0,"The material is thin , soft and stretchy and just sticks to your body , it was comfortable just didn’t like how it pretty much everything bra lining , underwear, every roll , shapewear underneath is a absolute must ! And for that I was disappointed, it also had a lighter spot on the top chest area and mid section of the dress , I had higher expectations with the dress !"
3.0,Two of three arrived broken. The leather was not attached to the metal. I glued it back myself. I still love them and wear them daily.
3.0,Not good for real cold conditions. Zippers doesn't work well. One doesn't work at all.
3.0,Pretty but very tiny!  Much smaller than I thought and I'll be sending back.
3.0,"At least one other viewer indicated these were more like tights than leggings, and I definitely agree. I liked the high waistband, but if you've got a generous backside the waistband in the back is not nearly as high as the waisteband in the front, and they're very see through in the back. I usually wear a L or XL, and I think it would be quite a stretch (literally) for these to fit someone who wears 3XL/size 22 as the description claims. At that point, they'd be more like black sheer hose than tights. They're also rather shiny, and I prefer a matte look with leggings, specifically so they don't look like tights."
3.0,"Pretty to look at but, super thin and see through! I wanted warmer"
3.0,"I want to like these much more but I don’t. They fit well and overall I like them, but if you sweat (I do!), then you will find your hands slipping in them, and it really is distracting. So if I didn’t sweat while riding, they’d get a 4.5 rating from me because the cushion is thin."
3.0,I expected high waist but I'm 5'10 and the high waist was just above my belly button. Still fits Ok.
3.0,"Cute top but way cheaper quality than I thought. It’s like a cheap satin-like shower curtain. I purposely chose the option that looked like it has flowy sleeves But that’s not what I received. Just regular sleeves. I was trying to avoid that because I knew the sleeves wouldn’t stretch. Fits my chest well, it’s a little loose but that’s the look/style I was going for. I’m a 34D, 5’, 130lbs and got a size medium. Not going to return it because it’s wearable, but don’t think I’ll get another."
3.0,"The dress was exactly as described and pictured. The quality was good for the price. It was just a bit too small for me. As other reviewers have mentioned, the skirt fabric is fairly heavy and stiff, especially compared to the lightweight knit bodice."
3.0,Buy one size smaller.
3.0,definitely not for wearing as a regular bra; not very flattering under clothing but as some basic lingerie works great. My partner loved it and it comes with the underwear..bonus!
3.0,Only has this review because the sleeves are too short.
3.0,Some of the hearts were unglued when I receive the order.
3.0,I love the necklace but I only wore it a little over a week when it broke. It is VERY delicate and it broke very easily.
3.0,Not bad shirt for the $
3.0,The size si different in this item.
3.0,It fits but the material is super rough.  Not comfortable at all
3.0,Doesn't at all fit or look as it does in the photo.
3.0,Good fit around the head but not as deep as I would have personally preferred. The worn look on the brim is a nice touch
3.0,Well I bought 5 of these and 3 work great.  Two have issues.  One adjuster is hard to turn and one the min and hour hand stick together when they pass at 6:33. Also since I bought them 3 days ago the price has dropped from 24 to $15.  I am sending back the two watches now and Amazon is sending two more.  The 3 that work are great and seam to be telling time correctly.  So it gets 3 of 5.
3.0,Cute colors. Inside some came out on both shoes within one hour of wearing. Disappointed
3.0,"Beautiful and nice material, however the size chart is not very accurate. I am 5'2 and 130lbs Bust 36 and acording with chart I must be in size M but is little large for me specially because the fabric is very stretchy."
3.0,Thin material and paying return shipping
3.0,"Bag as described, but already defective. Great size for what I needed, just not very tough."
3.0,"The eelskin on this lipstick holder is BEAUTIFUL.  I have brought eelskin products before and they wear very well.<br />BUT,  I was very disappointed in the mirror in the case, it IS NOT A MIRROR.  You, cannot see your reflection in it.<br />I tried cleaning it with water & alcohol, still no reflection. I was going 2 purchase 2 others for gifts, but concerned about the defective mirrors.  I would like to return it for exchange, but I'm afraid I'll still get a defective mirror.<br />I did a replacement order, sent both lipstick holders back. The mirror was defective in replacement as well.<br />the mirror. I would like 2 return this one for and exchange,  but not sure if the mirror would be better.  SAD, cause<br />the ellskin"
3.0,Nice but too long i hace to wrap ir around ny neck for it to fit good
3.0,I cannot complain for the money paid. They fit weird and sort of tight in certain areas but overall nice. Pockets are nice and deep.
3.0,"I did not like this shoe at all. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t what I got."
3.0,Fits fine - but thin material and dull color. You get what you pay for. :)
3.0,I really loved the look and feel of these leggings but after only having them on for 5 minutes the fabric began to catch on everything. I thought they would have a thicker more durable material like leggings but that is not the case. I returned because I don't think they will survive one gym session without looking totally destroyed.
3.0,The material is very thin and shows my giggles- not cute. I tried to return it and the company- VERY KINDLY- asked me to the keep the product and reimburse me minus $5.00 for shipping. I now use these around the house or with a very long shirt.
3.0,"Going by the measurements provided, and XL should have been fitted but not tight in bust and upper back, but this dress is uncomfortably tight in those areas.  Not worth hassle of sending back in this COVID 19 craziness, so i have a dress I will probably never wear."
3.0,"I would say I love this dress, but I asked for a size 6x, and they shipped me a size 4!  I am afraid to return it for fear that they will make the same mistake again.  So I am keeping it for another granddaughter who will eventually grow into it.  As for the dress itself, I really like it.  Too bad they couldn't process the order correctly."
3.0,Left side pocket has a large hole in it.<br />Otherwise they are nice shorts for the price.
3.0,Metal is dull. Not shiny like sterling should be. If I had paid more them I would return.
3.0,Quality is ok. Good for people who wear glasses as it doesn’t blur the glass with smog. Quality could have been better
3.0,"They are cute but they are no Flowy at all, I wear a size 4 but I bought a large so they would be extra loose and they are fitted in my hips."
3.0,"I ordered these earrings with hopes that were adequate size, they were not big enough, they are about the size of a 1/2 dollar coin. They are cute, and are not thin, they were durable, but not what I was looking for, so I returned them."
3.0,"This is a great travel hat as it folds up and can be unfolded to get back to whatever shape you want. Not sure it would prevent burning on your head due to the mesh-like fabric, but to block some sun it would be cute. Just not on me. I guess I am just not a hat girl. I wanted it to look good."
3.0,"For the price you can't beat it, does a lot more than what I needed which I like. The light is a bit too dim but I can't really complain."
3.0,blazer is good but the pant is too large
3.0,"I like this jacket. I did however get a jacket with holes in the pockets and contacted the seller (they requested pictures). I sent them with no response from them, just wanted some time of compensation. So, now I have to get them fix. The jacket though is great otherwise. I’m 135 (size 4 pant) ordered a large and it is a tad big (but I only had a T-shirt on)  but will be great with a sweater underneath!! The reason for only 3 starts was because of the defective pockets :(<br /><br />Maybe they will see this and get back to me!!"
3.0,"I love the look of them. I just really wish they were made from a better and thicker material. I wanted to wear them out when cold, which you certainly can,......... but they provide no warmth,.... so I don't. I will keep to wear around the house"
3.0,"For the price I can't complain too much, however these are more of a show necklace vs an all day everyday, I wore mine to sleep chain snapped I had then slept on top of it and bent it, within the first 24 hrs the following night my fiancé was changing shirts the pendant got caught in his shirt and the chain had snapped with out any pressure at all, for what I paid I did not expect fancy but I also didn't expect this either. Live and learn. I was very happy with how they looked though they looked exactly like the picture definitely a very cool keepsake"
3.0,"PROS:<br />-Inexpensive.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Took two and a half weeks to arrive from China.<br />-I got the ""retro gray"" style and it sits very low on the head, puching my ears down.<br />-Somewhat cheap materal, but hey... it's only 10 bucks!"
3.0,"A tad smaller around the chest than what you'd think, I thought it would fit since it is a stretchy material, but it looks very odd on larger chests; if you have a larger chest I wouldn't suggest this product, but otherwise super cute, and good material. A little short, but that's not much of a problem, not a bad buy!"
3.0,OK for the cost
3.0,I wish it was wider at the bottom
3.0,Magnet don't hold the flap open. Can't use.
3.0,Beautiful coat. I normally wear a U.S. size 4 and purchased a medium. The coat did not fit it was too small.
3.0,"Love these the first few times, no loner stick"
3.0,"The glasses I wanted were the ones pictured and I didn't read the color description, so when they arrived I was surprised because they were not the same color as the photo.  The mistake was mine and I kept them."
3.0,Well made nice fabric but not<br />For short people 😕
3.0,"I really liked the design of the band. It shipped quickly and fit my watch perfectly. Unfortunately, the buckle broke off less than a month after I got it."
3.0,Smaller than I expected; definitely have to loose some weight to fit although this is my dress size.
3.0,"I was very excited to get this blouse, but once I tried it on, I was very disappointed. The pattern on the fabric was true to the picture, but it was larger than expected and pretty boxy. I’m 5’7”, 125 lbs, 34A and I usually wear XS or Small tops. This blouse just didn’t have any shape on me. If it were available in an XS, it probably would have been fine, but I ended up returning this purchase."
3.0,"It's a cute dress, but was much shorter and tighter than expected."
3.0,Seems like good quality although I have only has it a month I cant gauge how long it will last. My others from a major player in this industry are over 3 years old. The fit is tighter than the norm.
3.0,Very comfortable. Cute cut for females.  Runs a little small. Writing already coming off a little.
3.0,Cute pattern and comfortable fit and material. The arms were odd in that it was either elbow length or roll them up to like the shoulders. Looked better rolled down. My husband thought it looked a bit dorky though
3.0,Just slightly too small to be comfortable. :(
3.0,Pretty dress; bad fit!
3.0,This hat was ok in terms of quality. But if you have a lot of thick hair like me then it is not for you. Very tight. I didn't use it but will find a small headed friend to give it to.
3.0,Falling apart already after 1 use. The metal structure easily disconnects from plastic. Lime green handle looks cheap. Wish i could return....
3.0,No complaints on the seller or delivery.  Product was inexpensive and not well made.  Easy to part ways with...
3.0,Unfortunately this dress was bigger than I expected. Very cute design but waist area was too big. I'm 5'4 and 120 pounds but I look big in the photo but I'm like half of this size.
3.0,Good legging.. some strings where poking out.  I had to do some cutting.
3.0,"They work for the price I guess.  Could probably find about the same quality for the same or less at any flea market or venue with vendors.  When I lose or break these, I may order again unless I find something else before. Pretty cheaply made, and the lenses are very thin.  Feels like they are going to snap when I'm trying to clean them.  They don't clean easily at all, cheap plastic I suppose.  Takes quite a bit of effort to remove all the smudges.  The plus to them,  they keep the sun out of my eyes, but that's what they are supposed to do anyway."
3.0,"The chain looks real cheap, but the elephant is pretty nice. Maybe with a nice gift box or pouch it would like better in presentation"
3.0,I like the dress however it is a little longer than I expected. Probably just going to hemm it a little and it shoukd be fine.
3.0,Not my color.
3.0,These are EXTREMELY see through! I was super excited to get these because I got a pair of these a few weeks ago from a different vendor which were not see through. They’re super cute on and fit comfortably.
3.0,"I like it, but you kind of need the clip for cash. This is great for credit cards and ID."
3.0,"the concept is good but they are not really invisible, still it is a good alternative to expensive re-sizing and large knuckle issues."
3.0,"Positives:<br />~This went well with my lolita dress<br />~It came neatly packaged.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />~This is a very delicate item!!! The materials this item is made from could easily fall apart (I have made jewelry like this before), so I advise to bring glue with you in case the flower piece falls off.<br />~The rose in the center was more of a pinkish lavender color rather than pink.<br />~The hook in the back was a little stiff feeling and a little difficult to open.<br />~It took a while for the package to get here (It got here one day late from when I needed it so I suggest to order early)<br /><br />With the amount of money it takes to make something like this the price is understandable.<br />Overall you should order it if you are willing to give this product a little Tender Love and Care when needed."
3.0,They do the job just wish they weren’t so thick
3.0,We gave this to our son for his birthday the end of April.  He has a dodge srt 4. It is very nice looking.  He loved it. He just got his driving permit.  Today it broke apart.  He is crushed.  Not good enough quality for how much is costs.
3.0,"good shirt, not cotton material but more of workout shirt material. runs small so size up"
3.0,returned costume to light of blue skirt .
3.0,"Was very easy to fold and was sturdy, but the first time I used them, one of the straps broke, so really can't use one of them, especially for the price"
3.0,"Even after gently hand-washing, the lace still smells and is itchy. It's a loose fit around the waist even tho I got the right size. The picture is definitely a fraudulent claim from a China seller who stole the photo from an actual website. (that's why they don't show faces because they don't preserve the right to do so). I learned that the hard way."
3.0,"I looks circle and in its place, but it is flimsy and not hard."
3.0,It's very long and kind of loose so I tie the shirt in a knot at the back. Love the shirt but I wish it wasn't so long
3.0,"The material is not for me, and the slit is way too high... I will be wearing this to bed."
3.0,"I bought this because I like traditional NATO straps but I wanted one compatible for the Pebble 2 HR so it could still read the HR monitor.<br />This strap is very comfortable, however, it is a bit smaller than the default silicone one that comes with the P2, the bottom strap part is about 1/4&#34; smaller, and if I wear it snug against my wrist the end of the strap barely goes through the 2nd metal rung.<br />I will keep using it though as I like it better than the default silicone one, however I wish it would have been the same length,<br />Will have to search for a longer NATO style &#34;bottom half&#34; of the strap."
3.0,It was cute didn’t fit too see throu
3.0,Fait
3.0,Look nice but easy to bend and break.
3.0,only because I did'nt like the material
3.0,I agree with other review
3.0,"Not real pearls. I should have read more carefully, but got suckered by the word “cultured” in the title. My fault, I guess, but it have to wonder if that wasn’t a deliberate misleading."
3.0,"These will work for what I purchased them for, which was to go boating for a cub scout camping trip, but they are a bit large for my son. They are hard to get a tight seal around the ankle as well, and a bit wide. They aren't supposed to be super snug, but I'd like them to be a bit snugger so he is not slipping and sliding around in them while they are wet."
3.0,Loved them and they were very classy but not for every day.  The hook broke within a month.  But I loved them.
3.0,"The hooks do not secure the masks well. Thankfully, I had bought a separate set"
3.0,Okay not the best quality
3.0,the arms were kinda snug everywhere else it fit comfy....
3.0,"Not all the same size. Some smaller than others. Some earloops longer on one side. They work fine, but are not uniform."
3.0,I ordered a different pair of OR gloves in a medium and they were huge. I ordered these in a small and they didn't even cover my palm. They were so soft - I wish I could have kept them.
3.0,"Okay, so when this medallion arrived, it was HUGE!!!! I thought it was going to be about the size of the necklace in the movie that Elizabeth Swan had, but NOPE!  It was actually about the size of a lemon and was heavy as well.  I had hoped it would come with a black string/chain as pictured.... Also NO!  It came with a cheap dog-tag like metal chain that looks out of place.  I was wanting to be able to actually wear this piece, but it's way too large & heavy to wear it. :(  So, it's sitting on &#34;display&#34; with some of my pirate collectibles."
3.0,"The material is quite thin on these; while the design is easy for kids to wear and manage, the actual efficacy of this product as a mask is questionable."
3.0,"Product has a small run in the fabric under the left arm. Still wearable, but it's unfortunate."
3.0,I guess the cute design is what made me purchase these socks.  They are thin and I thought I would tear them but they held up.  The only problem that I have is that they tend to work their way down the leg.
3.0,Size is about 2 sizes smaller . Eg I wear and xl and the xl was so tight on me my c cup boobs were flat.
3.0,"Half face is halloween store green, not like the original movie"
3.0,Waistband is heavy. Feel uncomfortable for something that should be lightweight. The fabric is light everywhere else. Runs large. I’ll try to get a smaller size and see if maybe that fixes it.
3.0,I love the support this bra provides. I would rate it a five except one issue. The zipper does not always stay zipped! And when it does unzip there is no stopping it from coming completely undone. There needs to be a better clasp at the top closure to keep the zipper from shifting and unzipping during times of a lot of arm movements. Fix that and this bra will be perfect.
3.0,Not sure how late by this will last. Purchased it for my three year old grandson who wanted a locket like his older sister. He will love it!
3.0,"Looks much better on this Tom Hardy looking guy than it ever will on me.<br />Not sad about that, but not that happy either..."
3.0,I found some tags I liked better & returned these.
3.0,I had to stitch it closer because it was roomy under arms but apart from that good value for monwy
3.0,The pattern is very pretty but I ordered a large because I like these to fit loosely.  I think they would fit a child not a woman.  About a size 0.
3.0,The A-line of the skirt plus the loose fabric and side pocket makes this dress feel too roomy. The colors are too brown for me. Not sure how they decided to do this color combo
3.0,"The ring is smooth surface, is not like the picture. I'm disappointed."
3.0,"The insert will fit my wallet, but only has 4 pockets, for 8 cards, rather than the 5 pockets advertised."
3.0,"Cute top but I didn't like the fabric very much as it felt way to heavy. It was also lower cut than shown on the model, and I'm not a fan of my girls hanging out every time I do a standing forward fold or lunge in yoga!"
3.0,I like the brand and color but it was just to small for my boots. I have purchased some that are the right length. It is a good shoelace.
3.0,"I've previously twice bought [[ASIN:B008V6589S COSMOS ® 7 PCS Different Color Cotton Sports Basketball Headband /Sweatband Head Sweat Band/Brace]], and got this one because I thought it would be nice to have more colours.  As it happens, the colours I got were much more pastel-shaded than it seemed in the picture (more in the way of lilac and peach than the usual radioactive-seeming primary colours).  I thought that that was great.  It's nice to be able to get girlie colours for a change.<br /><br />However, these particular sweat bands are much less substantial/heavy-duty than the ones I got in the 7-packs I mentioned above , most recently in 2015-01.  I don't know whether that means that all of their products are less substantial of only the ones in this 12 pack.  The heavier-duty ones are definitely nicer, but these ones still seem fairly absorbant and, as I say, the colours were great."
3.0,Bought a small and fits very loosely.  I'm 5' 4&#34; and weight 120lb
3.0,I'm 5 foot 11inches so I'm pretty tall. Unfortunately it's hard to find tall maternity jeans. These were unfortunately too short.
3.0,"These stay on my 3 year old better than traditional goggles.  However, the back strap does not fit her head well and bunches up in her hair."
3.0,"I like that this was real gold, and not gold over silver. The only thing I would say is that it is definitely not worth the price.  overall, I am satisfied with the product and it does what I needed it to do which is extend my necklace."
3.0,Hard to fasten and unfasten but looks great on
3.0,"It was definitely light weight, but I have to say I expected it to be thicker. I wanted it to be our son's winter jacket, but definitely not warm enough for that, more of a fall coat."
3.0,"Nice, but not adult size.  Will have to give to grandkids."
3.0,Bought for my daughter.  She loved it but it broke within a month.
3.0,"This top is attractive, but has an odd fit. Its very long. Im 5' 4&#34; and it comes down to the bottom of my bum. Its not very warm either, and the sleeves are very thin, just for show."
3.0,These were a lot bigger than I expected. I'm hoping to take them up.
3.0,"I ordered the smallest size, 0-3 mths, but it's larger. Hoping it shrinks in the wash."
3.0,Cute hat well made but it doesn't fit my head
3.0,"Definitely larger than I expected, but it does the job. However, it isn’t exactly very warm and so you would have to wear sweatpants underneath to get to that point. The material is very thin; quite frankly, you get what you paid for. Also I thought the leg area had pockets where the stitches were, b it they were just stitches"
3.0,"This ring fit perfectly at first, but after a couple months wear has stretched out between a ½ and full size."
3.0,Perfect for gifts. Fun watch to have.
3.0,"I ordered the Medium/Large and it was way too big! I am 5'2&#34; and about 120 lb, but the previous reviews made it seem like the dress sizes ran small, so I got the larger option and now I wish I hadn't. The dress was very cute! I was surprisingly very happy with the length, it went all the way to my knees, with the fringe a little longer. If I had got the right size originally, I think it would have been perfect. Unfortunately, I will be returning it."
3.0,"Not for cold temperatures, work well in high 30°F."
3.0,Too much material in the neckline. Otherwise it flowed nicely. Returned.
3.0,"Ordered for my 10 year old daughter.  Received on Friday evening.  By Sunday afternoon we needed to use Shoe-Goo on the soles of the shoes to fix.  Would have expected to be a little more durable so isn't an everyday sandal, more of a nice wear to church item."
3.0,"The color description is wrong , these are more gray than black . Other than that they are comfortable and don’t fall down .<br />Be warned they are long so you have short legs this could be a problem , I’m 5’11 and these go right up to my inner thighs"
3.0,"This doesn't sit on my head as the picture describes at all. There's a giant seam running down the back as well, so I'm not too impressed. I gave it to someone with less hair than me and it sits on her head a little better, so I don't recommend this for those with thick hair."
3.0,Not a bad shirt just that fast fashion bathing suit material
3.0,They are cute but I did think they would have sparkle on both sides but only have on the outside side. Keeping them though cause they are still cute.
3.0,I tried to buy according to my size but it was big I had to send it to adjust
3.0,"Hard to tell by looking at the pair which is left shoe , hyou have to look at the sole"
3.0,"It rides up a little, and I'm only a 34 waist"
3.0,"I wish the rings were all stuck together to maintain the look.  It is a pretty ring, though.  I got it to use it when I travel so I can leave the real bling at home."
3.0,"I am very tall and curvy and love the floor length of these skirts but they are very see through, so you will need a slip underneath.  Overall, beautiful skirts!"
3.0,The dye colored my baby's feet.
3.0,Huge! My son swam in this.  :-(
3.0,Not the greatest fit. They are more low rise brief than originally thought and they do run a little snug.
3.0,"This is an adorable, warm hat and scarf set. I got it for my 4 year old who loved it. However, it's so snug and my son is fairly small for his age. I wish I had known this when I got it since there is a good chance he may grow out of it before the cold weather comes."
3.0,First of all very nice bracelets but it says u can make them longer or smaller with a cord no no no u have to tie them in a knot by your self with 1 hand like what I'm sooo angry cause those are nice bracelets
3.0,"Though I got all 4, the grey was mixed up. It was not like the others, nor did it come with the design. The grey were also not joggers. More like leggings. The other 3 were soft comfortable and super cute. Would've given a 5star if they hadn't messed the one pair of joggers entirely."
3.0,Fits small and does not sit well in the shoulders.
3.0,Rather cheap looking
3.0,Ordered an extra large it fits more like a small 😢
3.0,It’s tiny
3.0,"I am a medium. I read that these ran small so I ordered XL so I would have a nice big workout tank.  The XL fits, but is tight on my ribcage and also shirts are unflatteringly short compared to current trend of longer tanks. Colors are cute."
3.0,I ordered medium and it fits like a small
3.0,I like the variety of earrings that you get and I’m very sensitive to certain kinds of metal but I have had no problems at all my only complaint is that the bars are very short so if you have ears that are on the thicker side these will be uncomfortable or if the  piercing is relatively new and still gets swollen when changing jewelry.  Overall these work great for me but they will not work for everyone.
3.0,Great price for practice shirts.  But once laUndered the stitching alone the sides shrinks so the shirts bow looked ruffled.  I think it’s because the stitch material is Cotten and the shirt is polyester.
3.0,"I bought this to replace a beloved similar hat  purchased in Ireland that was lost when traveling recently. This is water-resistant and the wide brim does a great job of keeping the water off my head and face.I like the style, too. However, it does not fit down over my ears very far and is easily blown off in the wind. I plan to add ribbons so I can tie it on, but I think a deeper cut and tighter headband would be excellent improvements!"
3.0,The quality of the beanie is alright but it's WAY to small. Seems to be made for a child's head. I'll be re-gifting this beanie to someone else.
3.0,Like I said.
3.0,I have thick thighs so the pocket area can use a lil room but the fit was ok!
3.0,"I ordered the 110 for my son, 16 months/32&#34;/22#, as that's what has been fitting him in the Asian sizes. I could tell the pants were more like leggings but had hoped they were stretchier or had more seat to cover his cloth diaper bum. The pants are screen printed with a thick paint and don't stretch as hoped. They're fine as pj pants since they fit a disposable okay but still show his diaper out the back, and the legs need to be rolled at least once. The top is very well made, cute but LARGE as in the neck hole hangs off his shoulders and he hates it. I'll put it away for the fall or when he fills out a bit more. Cute, cheaper than brick and mortar or etsy but weird sizing."
3.0,"For the price, these are nice. Nothing to write home about, but pretty, and an easy pop of color. I got the orange ones, and whilst they are a bit heavy, I liked both the color and the shape. The goldtone findings looked a bit cheap, but no one looks at those. My only somewhat negative comment actually has to do with the wearer (me). If you are at all accident-prone, you will break these. I literally had just taken them out of the bag, put them into my ears, appreciated them in the mirror, and hung them on my earring tree when they both fell off the tree somehow, landed on the floor, and cracked through and through. :("
3.0,"My 13 year old son was actually very excited with dressing up this Halloween. He is in that creepy crawler phase of life and was happy to be dressing up as the Reaper. At 5'6"" this costume fits him well, gives him a lot of freedom of movement in his legs and arms. This comes with several accessories: Chain, gloves, glowing eyes, scythe and belt. Because he wears glasses, he was a little bummed out that he can't wear the eyes without it interfering with his glasses, but it's ok as I would rather have him see at night.<br /><br />Issues are the Scythe is not long. It comes about half the length it should be. Yes, it’s not sharp at all. The chain does look a little ""cheap"" but at night it works. Also, the hood has a cover that masks the face and it was really hard to see. So, he was really disappointed."
3.0,i really like the color but the fit was not great I do not like it slipping off my head every time I move
3.0,"Listen, ik ik these are blue light glasses. Their whole schtick is to be tinted yellow to prevent blue light. But they are way too yellow to wear anywhere except in front of a screen that cannot see how you look in them. They fit my face well though."
3.0,Very comfortable band but the fabric really shows dirt and turned black within the first month.
3.0,Looks cheaper in person and the material is rough. I got the black/silver.  The colors may make a difference. Looked fine for the christmas party I went to but probably wouldnt wear again.
3.0,"Ordered the Rose Gold but, received Yellow Gold. Design of earring is unique."
3.0,"The closer on the case didn't last a week, we have had to glue it back on many times, the closer is Velcro and a snap would have been a better choice."
3.0,"This is a very nice bracelet. I ordered it to go with a ring I have that is also multicolored. It has a decent heft to it. Why only three stars?  I could not fasten the buckle. I tried doing it from both directs to no avail. The ends slide together, one side is round, the other fits around the round piece. After pinching my self a couple of times I gave up.  I fortunately have a husband that can make the connection (hopefully,  he hasn't tried to put it on me yet). If you live alone, best of luck!"
3.0,Nice fabric. Fits a little snug and is quite clingy.
3.0,Backwards zipper
3.0,Beautiful hat but it is just too large. I can't wear it.
3.0,"Not bad for the price, is a little longer than expected and much more “fake gold”<br />Colored than pictured."
3.0,I've had better clothes.  Stiff and not comfortable in hand.
3.0,"I like to wear my clothes loose, so I got a lg, and the body fits well, but the sleeves are a little tight and oddly sewn. The Greg I received was more of a light gray than the heather gray in the picture."
3.0,"The fit over my glasses and are polarized, but nothing special."
3.0,Looks good but‼️ Needs to be bigger
3.0,They are cute but not very soft. Just for show. Not really useful.
3.0,Super cute. The picture looks more like a sweater but it's a thin shirt. I took off the chains on the shoulder and I think it looks a lot better without them.
3.0,"The crease in the middle of the mask bothers my nose, so I had to add a bandaid to wear. They also cause my face to sweat, but they are comfortable for a short period of time."
3.0,I really wanted a big blue purse and I thought this was it; I wasn't sold on the price but I thought it was well made so I purchased it. The 1st day one of the lil things on the bottom of the purse fell off. I think it's cute but not worth the price.
3.0,Decent wallet.  This is my daily driver now.  Very difficult to remove ID from it's compartment.  Fits about 7 credit cards + cash + ID.  Covers the basics.
3.0,"Goood quality, but I’m usually size medium and it was way too small for me😞"
3.0,Much too large for a 7 year old boy but he loved it anyway
3.0,Item broke after a month.
3.0,I love This ring.. had it for exactly a year .. but 1 little stone popped out .. so sad .. but i still Order berricle products cuz they r very good quality.. this ring out the 30 rings i have From them is the only bad seed..
3.0,"Hard to get glasses to clamp together when you take them off because it’s very difficult to focus on the 2 lenses to join with the magnets. There was some extra tubing on the frame, about 2” in total but that’s not enough to still allow the wearer the room to focus on the 2 lenses to bring the magnets together when taking them off. Needs about 10-12” of tubing and has about 8” frame to frame.<br /><br />And note that these glasses aren’t like drug store cheaters; the lenses are full size.  Difficult to peer over to see distance objects when wearing them.<br /><br />Like the concept. Just not very well executed.<br /><br />Not sure if I’ll keep them. Depends on if I can get better at taking them off and trying to latch them under my chin.<br /><br />May go back to regular cheaters if I can find a strap that slides onto the frames and doesn’t leave the glasses dangling below mid chest."
3.0,Was a little disappointed one of the circular holds was broken when I got it. Easy fix though. It is very pretty and compliments any blouse.
3.0,They work but not really. Meaning they don’t stay latched on to the watch like they’re supposed to which has caused me to drop the watch. Could have been better quality.
3.0,the dress is of good quality and worth the price.  The description of the dress is wrong.  The dress is nylon not sheer as it appears on the site.  The dress runs big.
3.0,Its very nice but it arrived with a broken chain. I will have to find a chain for it.
3.0,Out of two orders i got maybe 5 pieces with any color and the rest was podge i could have bought a half pound of blue podge for the price of 1 order. Out of the 5 pieces with colors i may get something under 6mm in size at best.. On the other end excellent customer service so there's that.. Hopefully it was just a coincidence. Thanks for the refund! Perhaps I may try again at a different time to order.
3.0,A very nice shirt but the sleeves were a little too short.
3.0,Wish that the material didn’t shred in the washer & dryer!
3.0,The only thing I don’t like is that they are short on me
3.0,"I love the print and the dress fit my daughter perfectly, however my dress came about 3” too short (and I only stand 5’2”). The dress is what I call a “flood” dress. I actually hemmed it to a short tunic, but disappointed with the initial length."
3.0,"They work well and have helped my hedaches, but one came broken. The skrews and plastic are flimsy so be careful putting them away in bags."
3.0,Sizing was great! Compression just didn't seem right. I've been wearing compression socks for about 8 years and these just didn't seem like the 20-30 that is described.  The butterflies are slightly raised on the inside and I can imagine if the compression was right or if you have bigger calves that they would become painful from the impressions.
3.0,"The fit was a little strange, and the dress itself doesn't look of the best quality in person."
3.0,"Good Quality, thick enough and not see through! However, the colors are wayyyy off. It is a bright white tee and the color on the print is also a bit different. So keep that in mind. I do really like the fabric and it is comfortable. I ordered a large so it would be oversized and it fits as expected. Usually a S/M"
3.0,"Good size, loved the rose gold tone, but they did look a bit on the cheap side , like you'd get at Walmart ."
3.0,"If you have a big chest, this isn’t for you. It’s small and there is no support for the girls at all. The inside liner has no elasticity and the outside isn’t shaped for support, just loose like a crop tank. If you require no support, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
3.0,Ordered for a work event. It was wayyy too low cut for a work event. The material was ok. Light not heavy at all. It wasn't the best fit on me. Maybe for someone smaller
3.0,its narrow.
3.0,I'm a size 14/16 and the L fit when I cut the shorts out.
3.0,These are very nice but both of my heals slide off to the inside because of the way the straps are placed
3.0,Super small. I am petite and the straps on the shoulders are too short. I can’t imagine how this will work for someone that is 5’5” and up. I had to return.
3.0,Very nice only 3 stars as I wanted to use it as a toe ring. it fits snug with close toe shoes but otherwide I think it is great. Nice color.
3.0,It was not what the pictures says it was😔
3.0,Beautiful design. Just really large. But it is really pretty. Should be worn as a dress not with leggings.
3.0,It look very cheap!
3.0,These are very pretty earring that look as if they are made out of real silver and a real stone.  But I don't know if that's the case or not.  I had to do a few things to them to make them wearable.  I had to remove a wire and transfer it to the other side of one earring (there is a loop hole for it) so it would match the other earring.  Then I had to clip off the curved parts of the wires at the ends because I couldn't get them through my pierced ear holes with them curved up.  After all that they are now wearable and look nice.  Too bad someone at the factory put a wire on the wrong side as you can see in the photo that both are on the correct sides.
3.0,Does a decent job but it is NOT LEATHER.
3.0,"I'm 5'6 and 114 lbs and this dress was not flattering at all. If I was trying to hide a belly or large hips/thighs, then maybe it would work. But it just kinda draped over me. I didn't want something form fitting, but this was just too loose."
3.0,"Cute, construction alright, material a bit thin and a little stiff.  I don't expect it to last long but it is nice enough."
3.0,way smaller medals than  similiar ones sold on Amazon.I thought it would be similiar to others with larger medals
3.0,Small and cheap quality
3.0,They're alright I guess but I found them a bit too small. You're not going to carry a lot of groceries with one of these...
3.0,Dress is cute and fits great in the length. But if you are top heavy the ruffle does not lay flat. I wear a 40D or 38DD and ruffle sticks up.
3.0,Cute hat but small.  Packs well in suitcase and retains shape.
3.0,"Was great for like half a month, then started to fall apart. I'm down like two strings now. I do enjoy the adustable tie tho. Just don't pull on it and don't sleep with it"
3.0,I am short (5'3&#34;) and this was short on me
3.0,Not great quality. Had many loose strings / threads. It's okay...definitely wearable...but I wouldn't purchase another like it again.
3.0,Came with a broken link.
3.0,Arm hole is deep
3.0,Did not fit the newest galaxy watch.
3.0,"The choker is very cute, but it did come broken. The clasp was off when I opened the package but I was able to fix it. It's very stiff as well which I wasn't expecting."
3.0,the arms are way too small.
3.0,It's not the bag's fault but it is too large to be able to take on board the flight as a &#34;free&#34; item.  It needed to be a little smaller to qualify.  It would qualify as an underseat item if we wanted to pay extra...but not just a the free item.
3.0,Bright Yellow not a light yellow like the picture
3.0,"The sweater is a decent product for the money. It runs VERY small. I wear am typically a Large in sweaters, ordered and XXL!  Also, the ""Red"" is not a true red. It is burgundy."
3.0,"Lovely to look at, but not much for modesty. Sequins caught on things. Some cords were uneven and fraying upon unboxing. I was afraid I would not be able to stay still enough during dinner to avoid damage to it. Was also quite big. My shoulders are a bit narrower than average for my size."
3.0,"This wig is much bigger and poofier than the picture lol. I tried to gently comb it but it's hard to do since it's cheap synthetic. I've seen videos online showing that you can soak them in fabric softener, blow dry, sprinkle baby powder to make less shiny, etc  to help a wig not look so &#34;cheap&#34;. But my 10 year old daughter likes it so she might end up wearing it for Halloween instead of me. I think it's great for a kids costume, & I don't mind the shine so much but for me it's just way too Dolly Parton lol. If my daughter decides against it, I'll return it."
3.0,It is much bulkier than I thought it would be.
3.0,"Hats are too tight...I purchase 3 for me and family members who are average sizes and we all thought they were tight.  Although made well, after wearing for more t(an 25 minutes you want to take it off!"
3.0,"I ordered this top in what I felt was the correct size. After trying it on I thought it was too tight around the midsection (fabric was somewhat thin) and wanted to return it.  When I printed up the return label my surprise was that I had to return it to China and the cost would be approximately $35 whether I used USPS, UPS. I'll give the top to one of my daughters before I pay that much to return this item. I would advise anyone using this company think twice about their products and return policy."
3.0,eh ok
3.0,small small small
3.0,"It is nice, and I like the shape, I got this facemask a couple of months ago and now it looks very old I've washed it about 10 times"
3.0,"Super cute, but the back of the earrings start to loose their pinching ability after a couple of wears. Too bad. They are cute and fun!"
3.0,Material was kind of thin and cheap. I will wear it around the house on relax days. I wouldn't purchase it again.
3.0,"Gloves are nice and pretty, very formal and warm ok,  but not enough for temperature below 30F. I had to wear a thinner pair underneath  just to keep on mind.<br />Also, as much as you can pull down on each finger, the ""touch screen"" is not true at all. Every time I wanted to take a picture, I had to take them off."
3.0,I could not tell if the material was good or the clothes for because I never received the item. I wish I did
3.0,"Was not as wide as u would have liked, it was still nice and durable"
3.0,i like the band but i had a pin bust already. Cheap looking pins but it was a VERY inexpensive product so...
3.0,Cheap quality. The strap ripped the first time I went to wear it out. But it is cute and fits great.
3.0,"I love these flop flops, bought twice but both times the strap ripped between the toes. Can they change what they use in the product that causes it to do that? Haven't had them long. Would continue to buy except I can't keep replacing when they RIP same place each time."
3.0,"These gloves keep hands very warm, but the lining isn’t well attached and tends to bunch up when trying to put the gloves on.  Could be fabulous, if the lining stayed put."
3.0,"This bag is good quality but it is bulkier than I expected. I wish the company would include a picture of their bags being held by a human figure (model) to give a more accurate idea of dimensions and size. Or a video clip would be nice to improve the online shopping experience. I looked at the measurements but had to use my imagination to envisage how it would look being carried. It's not what I expected and I am not thrilled. If it was not so expensive for me to return it, I would send it right back!"
3.0,Runs small. Not very well made.
3.0,The collar bow doesn't seem to sit right on me like it does on the model in the picture
3.0,"Shear, cheap, feels more like a slip than a dress"
3.0,It’s too small and doesn’t give the support it should or said it would.
3.0,This was so so tiny. Sizing way off. Had to return.
3.0,"I loved the bottoms! They are stretchy and flattering, however the top was awful. The straps are too short and not adjustable. There is also no padding, so you are basically wearing a training bra. I would have returned the set, however I figured that I would use the bottoms with another swimsuit top"
3.0,It get slack after a while
3.0,"These ""pants"" are just knit leggings, not dressy enough for a business workplace."
3.0,Its a little flimsy . you have to be extremely careful with it.
3.0,"I loved the color so vibrant, and the fabric is soft and smooth. However the shirt is cut small.... so size up."
3.0,"Great for the passport, but too small for the international driver's license. It just needs to be a little larger. I liked the extra pouch. I kept a second credit card and money in it, incase my wallet got picked."
3.0,Nice size scarf but the ends start to unravel after a few months.
3.0,"There were only 20 hats, not 24."
3.0,Cute rings.
3.0,"if you could order the next size up, these slippers fit to tight. the bottom has good support."
3.0,"I really like the socks. I am very active at work, so a couple of them got holes in them. They are better suited to an office job.  I told the company about the holes, and they immediately sent me a new pack.  Excellent customer service."
3.0,Very cute... made small
3.0,"Its ok, works like most any hydration bag. Only used it once and it worked as well as any other cheap bag I've tried by hitec, camelbak etc.<br />I like the opening top for cleaning, hard to say if the handle closure system will hold up yet.<br />Not a huge deal but the big handle doesn't fit the bag support hook in any of my packs, I just tied a small piece of paracord to it .<br />I have only used it once so far on a day hike and it didn't leak, but that isn't saying much as they usually don't when new.<br />I gave it 3 stars since it was still cheap and worked, but there is some marketing nonsense that gives me pause as well as the fact that the same bag is sold under other brands for cheaper on amazon prime.<br /><br /> A lot of the description is marketing nonsense, like the &#34;patented mouthpiece and hose connections&#34;, yeah right, its a screw in fitting at the bag like many bags and the hose connections are plain old barbed plastic fitting. The mouthpiece is the same as any other hydration bag i.e. bite to open, the on off push pull style is used on many different brands of bags. Leads me to wonder if it meets any of the claimed certifications.<br />There are, as you would suspect, no patent numbers listed anywhere for all the claimed &#34;technology&#34;<br />Probably just plain old pvc tubing , silicone mouthpiece etc.<br /><br />And like a lot of chinese products on amazon and other online retailers, items are often made by one company and sold under many brands. After purchasing I noticed this identical bag is sold under different brands like Sunnytrip and baen sendi on amazon prime for several dollars less. Same castings/molds just different brand embossing."
3.0,"I was disappointed with the finishing of he scarf, otherwise the fabric was soft and warm."
3.0,They fit tight when ordering get a larger size
3.0,"Too big, too short, too tight, too everything. Not a good shoe, it gaps in the middle, no arch support, too short and very uncomfortable. I can't wear them, they're sitting in my closet, just wasting space and money."
3.0,"Dress is cute, packing folds don’t come out."
3.0,they were way too tight on my feet.  I had to return them.
3.0,Looked great when purchased. Washed once and legs shrunk to mid calf. Careful when drying. The material is nice though.
3.0,"I purchased this model immersion heater in May 2018 to replace a cheaper model that had stopped working.  This one from Going in Style was my 3rd one (the prior 2 were both about a third of the price and both did not last -- just POOF, stopped working).  I successfully used this new heater in June on a trip (U.S. outlets).  In September, the heater worked perfectly the first 3 days overseas (I used the correct adapter), and then when I plugged it in for the 4th day and set my timer, the water and the heater were ice cold after the timer went off.  I unplugged it and tried again -- nada.  Fast forward to November 2018, I submitted a request for a return.  KUDOS AND 5 STARTS TO GOING IN STYLE!!! EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!  Not only did they send me a new immersion heater, they did not request that I return the defective one.  I just received my new one yesterday with a personal Happy Thanksgiving note from Don, and I tried the replacement immersion heater this morning.  It works fine.  Only time will tell......  This is my 4th one.  I hope this one lasts longer than the other 3 I have owned.  I love the concept, and the size is right for travel.  Thank you Going in Style!!!"
3.0,I love the look of these pajamas but size wise I would rate them a Small or medium. They do fit all sizes but not as comfortably.
3.0,"Just ugh. Good quality, cute fabric- WHY put them upside down?! I'm gonna keep it! But buyer beware, these cats are Upside Down. Size 24months."
3.0,"These ballet tights have great elasticity and are made from good tight woven fabric, but the waist elastic band is extremely tight. Although I might have gotten A size smaller than my normal, I did was very uncomfortable in these tights after an hour due to how incredibly tight they grip around the stomach with very little give. I did enjoy the quality of the tight itself as they held well and without rip during multiple wears."
3.0,Good quality but stated sizing is grossly off.  This shirt runs VERY large.  You will need to size down.
3.0,The shirt is made well and fits as expected. I'm so disappointed that the decal is not rose gold in color!!! One of the reasons I purchased this shirt. Not a deal breaker.... I'll keep it but I'm not happy that it isn't as described.
3.0,The dress color wasn't what I thought.. and it was extremely long and big.. it didn't fit me<br />. But would good on someone with the right shape
3.0,Not as small or pretty as described.
3.0,"Quality is decent, but tends to run a bit smaller than other Under Armour shirts I've purchased in the past."
3.0,"The length of this jacket hits close to my waist instead of the top of the hips. The shoulder width is good. But the color is not grey, it is very much purple. But the fabric and make look good quality so I will probably keep it."
3.0,"These are some fairly nice-looking and comfortable socks. They don't seem all that durable, but that shouldn't be much of a surprise given their price.<br /><br />My only major complaint would be that they &#34;gentle grip&#34; is a bit too gentle, so I constantly find myself having to pull these socks up."
3.0,This product is just ok for me. I'm not wowed but I don't dislike it. Personally I'm not big chested so I don't need a ton of support. The bra is made of old fashioned panty hose material so it is very stretchy and moves around. I wear it on days when I'm doing things around the house and don't want to wear a real bra but want to be covered. It's good if you're just running errands or even for a very simple date night where you're not doing physical activity you're just kind of being pretty. If you are very active or need a lot of support you should probably skip this one.
3.0,"I’m 5’2” and a size 12/14.  I bought an L.  The dress was so tight in the chest I couldn’t get it over my 36C chest and the arms were very tight also.<br />Odd fit.  Otherwise, I think I’d have loved this dress for summer - light weight and airy."
3.0,We do a turkey trot after dinner. Fun for the kids to wear
3.0,She can't get them open to wear them.
3.0,"A wide range of sellers on Amazon offering Thai fisherman's pantelones use the very same product description for items of various qualities making it difficult to find the right fabric. What I was expecting is made from light cotton canvas (for lack of a more accurate term) and this pair were more like a very light linen. Reference the photos of the same items at lower price points, especially those where the fabric is spread out and one might notice that light permeates along the top of the waist on the items made from lighter fabric. Nothing at all wrong with them, just not what I was looking for. Returned for a prompt refund. Seller is Tops!"
3.0,"Compré este color de este modelo porque en Europa no está disponible, pero me temo que fue un error.<br />La capa negra es súper delicada y el cristal se raya con una facilidad pasmosa. Además la legibilidad del dial es nula y las funciones confusas.<br /><br />No lo recomiendo."
3.0,"The quality was very nice, but I have a long torso and this tank did not measure up. Wish it had, it seemed like a very nice product."
3.0,It is very pretty. Material is very thin and runs a little small.
3.0,You get what you pay for I suppose. Its cute but It's actually too small for my neck and it's not leather even though it's advertised that way.
3.0,I bought an XL and was disappointed that the shirt was not as loose fitted as it looks on the model. The shirt is still very soft and I am keeping it.
3.0,They'll do
3.0,its ok it sometimes hard to pull out your pocket because of the material. but it looks sleek and not bulky
3.0,I love these. Great quality but 2 arrived broken so only 3 out of 5 pairs are wearable.
3.0,"Good looking, nice material, but run small."
3.0,I like them but they made me feel dizzy for sum reason after wearing them for a while but there nice like the big shape
3.0,After washing the shirt it became a little smaller making it somewhat short in the arms. I bought a medium and wish I would have gotten a large.
3.0,"Husband loves these shorts for sleeping. He normally wears a medium (small butt, bit of a belly), and while these fit, he but agrees a large would be better."
3.0,"Wish it had a few large side pockets, and liner was thicket"
3.0,Stiff and sort of cheap but good for price
3.0,"I got the black and white set in a large, the white one fits but the blacks too small and they both said large? Other than that the quality is great and the one that fits holds up through washes"
3.0,Fit as expected but the fabric is not top quality; it's very thin and had some significant creases on the sides of the legs that didn't relax in the wash and took significant ironing.
3.0,"Nice material and comfortable. Wicks sweat and water away well. I understand this is a &#34;form fitting&#34; shirt, but the size was still a bit small. In many t-shirts the XL size works for me. This shirt worked well in my mid-section. However, around the arms and across the chest was a bit small. For your information, I have about a 46&#34; - 48&#34; chest and 18&#34; - 20&#34; arms."
3.0,"Okay, it is a pretty good product to say it all, besides one thing: Hakuryu's weapon was bent at an odd angle--both the blade and the handle by his head--due to the way it was wrapped. It did not come in any case, nor packaging, other than being wrapped tightly in bubble-wrap(hence the bending). Other than that, this item was splendid, and I definitely recommend it, if you're a fan of Magi. It fits well on lanyards, wallets, pretty much anything with a key-ring. Now, to get Killua(Hunter X Hunter), Sasuke(Naruto), and Gray(Fairy Tail), and my collection will be complete. ^^"
3.0,"I love the warmth and feel if this coat. Only one negative comment.  It comes really wrinkled  and even after washing and drying it is still wrinkled. Hoping washing again will help or may  need to send to dry cleaners, which is expensive."
3.0,"The pictures of the dress are accurate and it fit well,but be advised - the material is very thin. I was hoping it would be a heavier fabric,but it's very flimsy and wrinkles easily. I would describe it as tissue thin and silly. Would be a good choice for a cool summer night but in no way is what I would choose to wear in winter even with tights and a sweater. Love that it has pockets but in the end decided to return it."
3.0,It fits as expected. I made the mistake of putting it in the dryer and the lettering came off in a few spots 😫! I wish I had let it air dry....
3.0,"Overall, the product is comfortable and light weight.  However, the size is much larger than expected."
3.0,"They are good for reading when I am unable to wear my glasses and need PPE. However, I have a small face and they seem to run small. They hit my eyebrows at an odd area. Overall, they serve their purpose."
3.0,The stones I got were not the bright blue as shown in the picture.  They are very dark in color.  I like the set however not thrilled with the dark color.
3.0,"Feels nice, decent quality but dye bleeds when washed so dont mix in the washer with other clothes, recommend a hand wash"
3.0,"The cardigan is nice but size way too big for a size S, To bad because my Sis really wanted it."
3.0,It's a lil darker than depicted in the pictures
3.0,Lovely little and it long for my kid
3.0,It's really too small and delicate to look like a cat.
3.0,The material is cheap and quality of dress is poor
3.0,Nice fit. It rides up and doesn’t stay put.
3.0,These fit great but the issue we have is they started to fray on the 6th wash cycle (even bagged).  I would call this set a 3 star buy for the iffy quality...
3.0,"... but unfortunately, the string broke within two weeks and the pewter bends much more easily than I'd like. Search the web and find a better one. I wish I had done a better search."
3.0,Good but a lil bit expensive
3.0,"It is very comfortable, but they started looking old after just one wash"
3.0,The blazer listed as pink looks mauve in the picture and is peach in person. I ordered it a M and it fit like an XS. Tight in the shoulders and the length was above the waist. It did not look like how it looks in the picture at all. The fabric is thin and see through.
3.0,"Kind of lower quality, it’s kind of cropped. Slightly see through."
3.0,"6ft 180 pounds - ordered a medium and it was just about right.  If anything just a little big but not much.  Shirt is ok, has a very cheap feel and sticking around neck seems minimal and cheap as well.  Doubtful it will hold up but will make a good undershirt or gym shirt for a while.  Would definitely not purchase again.  Amazon essential athletic fit shirts are much better - even though they dont last either.  At 10 bucks a piece I can replace them every couple of weeks...."
3.0,This bathing suit is super cute but not at all comfortable. The metal clasps pinch a bit around the hip line. The bottoms run a bit small. Overall cute bakini but I wouldn't actually wear it for too long.
3.0,"The short excess length of chain, where you hook the clasp to attach it, broke after 2 wearing. I’m going to have to buy a replacement length to continue wearing it. You get what you pay for."
3.0,Beautiful color. Chiffon like material. But way way way too small
3.0,"Cute shoes for the price. However, the zipper does not really zip all the way up."
3.0,"The dress is not brown! Mine was an orange color. On the picture, it displays as tan with dark brown letters. Some of my F's were faded. Not great quality at all but comfortable. Very long.  I may return."
3.0,"IF you're Plus Size woman I dont recommend this dress, the back strings  are to tight it barley fit I had bought XL I'm 5,7 size 14 If they had 2x will fit better. My rolls wont pop out lol"
3.0,"So... these are not the best. Look a little parachute-like on and they definitely shrink in the washer. I mean, they’re cute at first so if you plan on really them each one or two times go for it."
3.0,Soft and feel well. Would give a 5-star but the tops tend roll down.
3.0,Fabric is too thin and quite see-through.
3.0,At best a 2x would fit a size 4 this big and loose but it makes a nice light cardigan
3.0,Plastic not metal.
3.0,These give you a good idea of what a nose piercing might look like on your face but the magnets aren’t strong enough to keep it in place. Great for costume but not sure if you could wear it for hours. The pressure on the nose was uncomfortable. But the look is nice.
3.0,"The dresses, are a pretty color, but  they actually, look like a dress,  made out of thin sheets!  I thought,  it was like  a slip type dress, nothing like the pictures, but would be ok, to wear over a bathing suit?"
3.0,"This was just barely cute enough for me to keep. The back is very long (which I guess they show you in the last picture). The reviews say order a size up so I got a Medium when I'm normally a Small. However, I think I could have gotten a small. Its a bit baggy and the extremely long back just looks silly, so I will probably only wear this shirt tucked in. Furthermore it is **very sheer**! I plan to only wear it with an undershirt."
3.0,This ring is ok bur really shiny that makes me wonder is it sterling silver.But it is pretty & comfortable.
3.0,"I have kind of a mixed review on this. I didn't buy this as a wedding ring. My guy likes it a lot and was very appreciative, but I thought that it looked a lot better in the picture. It's not as heavy as it looks in the pic, and is not as wide as it looks either.<br /><br />I was going to return it,but my guy wants to keep it so....<br /><br />Edited 4/5/11:<br /><br />Have had it about 2 months now, and it is no longer black. It's faded, washed out, gray now. That is not to say it looks bad - it doesn't. Actually, it looks pretty OK gray, kind of vintage-y, but the whole entire reason why I bought it was because it was BLACK and I wanted to give him a BLACK ring with the cable.<br /><br />Others have made comments about the cables breaking...so far so good on that front. But watch, now that I said that, they're gonna break, LOL."
3.0,"While this is a good quality suit and a gorgeous deep red, the fit  Just didn't work for me.  I am 5'2&#34;,  38c bust, 30 waist and 38 hip. The bottom of the suit and thru the torso fit great,  nice moderate coverage on the bum, but the cups were way too large!  lucky for my Mom who is a f2f, she is getting a new suit while I keep searching."
3.0,"very heavy, but adorable!"
3.0,It does do the whole spin thing but personally i feel it’s too chunky on my finger to wear as a ring
3.0,The length of this dress is longer than shown in the picture. I was happy that the sizing chart was accurate and I had no problems with the size.
3.0,"These look pretty nice, but are not great functionally. The problem is that if you put a wide key (like most of us have for modern cars) on the ring, you have to widen the ring pretty far to get the key on, as you would any ring, except the titanium doesn't come all the way back to the original ring form as you would expect. Basically it opens the coil and leaves a significant gap all the way around. I good spring steel ring would remember it's shape better and snap back to original form."
3.0,Well made but from.china and terribly mislabeled for size. Got a 9/10 for my small 8 year old and it is more like a 5/6. Far too small.
3.0,Great shirt I expect dry fit to fit but be too tight. Definitely not true to size.
3.0,"I loved these earrings, they were beautiful in the pictures and beautiful in person. After having them for over a year, I assumed over time they would be easier to place in my ears and remove. However, even my boyfriend has trouble getting these earrings out of my ears or putting them in. The front of the earrings can spin off the bar, as well as the ball on the back. We almost always have to use pliers to get the earrings loose. They are so tight it is ridiculous because I've worn almost every pair more than once! If we don't use pliers, then they fall out of my ears and I lose the back or front. Over half of my pairs no longer have balls because they fall out too. The size is true, absolutely, but keeping this little suckers in is a whole different story.<br /><br />TLDR;<br />Cute, but these are very difficult to remove the balls or the front of the earrings to place/remove from your ears. If you aren't willing to use pliers anytime you want to put these in or remove them, buy different earrings."
3.0,top ball unscrewed too easy - lost it :(
3.0,"These gloves are nice and warm, even in a Wisconsin winter! However, though I appreciate being able to use my thumbs on my phone without taking off the gloves, the thumb hole is way too large and lets in a lot of cold. Because of this I have to wear another pair of gloves underneath. I will be sewing the thumb hole shut when I find the time, Otherwise solid construction and material choices."
3.0,Thank goodness I have small breast. I ordered a medium after reading the reviews and it fits just fine. I thought the color would be olive but it's more like a teal. Anyway it will work for the price.
3.0,"I'm 5""2, 130lbs and wanted to be able to wear warm clothes underneath so I went with a medium and I'm so glad I did . Fits great with leggings and long sleeve under. I love the material it's so stretchy, almost that silky bathing suit material. The print is ahhmazing until you get to the backside. There's no vertebrae and the heart is mis shaped and the pelvis is lop sided. I loved everything otherwise so I went and ordered another medium in the same print but worried and bought the golden and the diamond prints, All in mediums. The 2nd rose hearted print arrives again the same thing! Beautiful front unaligned back. The golden skeleton is a little better as far as the vertebrates go since it has some sort of bone there but it's not right either, it's doubled up like and it's very yellow not gold. The diamond one is probably the best structure out of all 4 suits I bought And like so many reviews recommend maybe go ahead and buy 2 🤷🏼‍♀️I plan to edit this review with pictures when I pick a print and attend the party"
3.0,Flannel is not really soft. Too tight for comfort after laundering.
3.0,Material didn't seem to be of high quality.
3.0,LO TUVE QUE DEVOLVER PORQUÉ ES MUY PEQUEÑO DE CINTURA
3.0,Tight in shoulders so go way bigger
3.0,I like the bands themselves. They look great and fit perfectly but hat darn clasp has got to go. I am not bothered enough to send them back but buyer beware. The metal clasp digs into the skin. After a while it gets to be. Annoying and uncomfortable.
3.0,The design is very pretty but the fit is too small and the stretch is too tight. I ordered a size XL my usual size and the fit was too small so make sure to go up a size bigger when you order this style.
3.0,Was excited to get this set. Recently traveled from Kansas City to Denmark (international) the large piece sustained damage from the corners where the covering was rubbed off. On my return trip the side handle was destroyed. I had to toss the handle at the baggage claim. One of the zippers in the interior &#34;unzipped&#34; and was useless. Get what you pay for.
3.0,"Note: I'm 5'11"" and ~215 lbs when I wore it last and had an XL. It was tight enough I had to wear one of the corset strings open; an XL is typically a slightly to moderately loose fit on me. This size is comparable to a men's medium, for context. Also, what the hell....Ha ha."
3.0,"I like the idea but disappointed you cannot make a truly unique seal. It would be nice to offer different fonts, three letters, or even customer-uploaded vector designs."
3.0,Really cute but wayyyyyy too big. I wear med but got large thinking its gonna be a small dress and it hit my calves and I'm 5-7! Sure you can pull the strings to shorten it but it might be super bunched. Cute but not what I expected.
3.0,Order one size smaller
3.0,"Great as a beach cover up, terrible as a dress. way to see through. had to return."
3.0,"It isn’t the best material, they are pretty small so I don’t recommend getting these if you have big/chubby fingers but overall it isn’t bad product."
3.0,"IT'S OK, NICE PACKAGE THOUGH."
3.0,Looks good on picture; but feels cheap to touch and feel.
3.0,Cute but kinda cheap material.
3.0,Nice don't dry in the dryer and buy size up.
3.0,"Not the greatest quality (yes, I should have known from the price), but I’ve bought lots of clothes from Mordenmiss in the past and their quality is generally higher than this.<br />I’m not sure if this top will last through any sort of machine washing, so will probably just hand wash it. The cat is cute. I don’t love it, but I’m too la y to return it, essentially.<br /><br />Summary: “Meh.”"
3.0,"I almost rated this hat 2 stars and if I saw this in a store, I would not have purchased this.<br /><br />The hat itself is very nice and very attractive in the various shades of brown. It has a partially canvass-like and knit exterior with fake leather and fur. The interior head area is quilted and the ear area also has fake fur. This hat is both warm and comfortable.<br /><br />The fur sheds, which is a negative. However, the biggest negative is the buckle. No matter how I tried, I could not fasten the buckle with the hat on. Instead, I had to fasten it before I put it on. Lucky I am still able to work my head into this with the buckle already fastened.  I personally only like clasps on these type hats. Having to rig this up like a belt is awkward and almost impossible to do. Had I not be able to get this on my head with it already fastened, I would have rated this 2 stars. It is only 3 stars because I am still able to use this hat.<br /><br />If this had a clasp like bike helmets have, I would have rated this 4 stars. If the fake fur was non-shedding as well, it would have gotten 5 stars."
3.0,"It was a big square, instead of the rectangular bag we were expecting.  Otherwise fine"
3.0,Too big for a bucket hat
3.0,They are okay.. pretty but not the greatest quality. The black one came with brown thread coming out already.. and the white one had some sort of noticiable glue on it..
3.0,The colors were nice but it just didn't quite fit right. I feel like this would work for most but didn't work for me.
3.0,It is tighter than expected. I ordered a xtra large but It fits like a medium. Order 2 sizes up.
3.0,"It’s ok, not great"
3.0,I like the colors but very much dislike that they are way to large around the legs and almost like thongs.
3.0,Love Outback Trading clothing but this one fell short of my wife's expectations.  Not outstanding quality as she's come to expect from this pricey manufacturer.  Skip this one.
3.0,"I returned it because although I liked the look of the watch it seemed too light in weight, seemed of less quality than the one I currently have that has a leather band."
3.0,Poor quality material and very little filling.
3.0,The fit is good. I would like for them to be thicker and thus more comfortable.
3.0,Was kind of upset bc I got this for my step daughter for Xmas and she said they sell them at Walmart. Bummer!
3.0,"Fit was good, but I returned it because it makes a strange squeaking noise when moving arms."
3.0,I ordered the smallest size for my 2 years old and it would have fit a 4-5 year old.
3.0,Cute but I have lots. The hat is too small and my necklace came with a knot in it.
3.0,"This watch was nicely packaged. It would make a good gift for the right person. The light blue color shown on the sales web page is much brighter than the actual watch which first appeared black to me.<br /><br />The watch band seems to be vinyl. I found it difficult to attach to my wrist. I believe I have an average size wrist but the band was small. I had to latch it on the very last hole. This might be a consideration for some people. I tend to use Twist-O-Flex watch bands so if I do decide to use this watch often I will change the band. The band fit my 10-year-old son well although he too said the vinyl band was difficult to put on and take off.<br /><br />The first disappointment is all too typical for these expensive watches. That is there is a unique magnetic cable to charge the watch. I would MUCH prefer a microUSB or USB-C socket on the watch. The unique cord means I have only one. If it was microUSB I'd have many around the house and in both cars (even the boat). Also the typical charge cable, as is this one, has only a magnetic connection to the watch. That is good in that if the watch or cable is jerked away the connection is lost but no harm is done. On the other hand it is all too easy for that connection to slip off and the watch doesn't get charged.<br /><br />I like the face of the watch which is almost edge-to-edge and jet black. The images are bright and sharp.<br /><br />Connecting to WareOS on my phone was easy and quick.  When the watch was connected and set up it also downloaded my gmail account to the watch.<br /><br />This is my third expensive smart watch. One of the other watches burns through the battery so just  can't make it through a day without being recharged after already charging it overnight.  So what about this one?<br /><br />Well I full charged it about 6pm, then played with it a couple of times throughout the evening checking over all of it's features. I spent perhaps 45 minutes actively working with the watch. By this time the watch charge was at 61%. I let it sit on the shelf the rest of the night, not being charged. At 8am the next morning it was down to 11%. So this watch also appears that it can not make it through the day without both an overnight charge and at least a partial mid-day charge.<br /><br />The watch works with the Android WearOS app and it does it well. The majority of the smarts of the watch are really built into the Android app with the watch being mostly an interface to the app. Some watch Setup controls are only done on the watch while some are done on the phone's WearOS app. Some features can be used with the watch being distant from the phone but other features require that the phone be within range of the watch.<br /><br />A number of different watch faces can be loaded and selected on the phone. Even more watch faces can be purchased."
3.0,These are cute but not what I expected. I returned them .
3.0,"beautiful!  Not very durable, but for the price, good enough.  Love the design."
3.0,"Ordered 3 units but only 1 worked.  One unit wouldn't output from the speaker terminals, another output crackled audio from speaker terminals.  One worked as expected for sound outputs, SD and USB readers and other described functions.<br />1 of 3 is a bad track record but the one that worked is a handy piece of hardware for projects that play mp3 files on power-up."
3.0,"To tight for man's head,"
3.0,I love love love this watch. Sturdy material and SO cute. I couldn't get my latch to stick and I made sure I watched videos on how to adjust it. Still didn't stay. May have been a defective one. Unsure. Haven't heard back on a refund. It's a bummer. Wanted to rock it out. :(
3.0,They were not the color I picked out and were darker than I thought they would be.
3.0,"My daughter wears a toddler 6 and I ordered the 8. They fit great, I used the measurements from the size chart. 3 stars because they're super strong plastic smelling, even after airing them out, which makes me anxious about allowing her to wear them..: and they rub her feet near the princess part of the shoe, so they're only worn for a short bit of time until(if) she breaks them in. The princess is so cute and looks exactly as pictured."
3.0,I brought this band and its okay but it doesn't stay  snap I've lost my watch couple of times and found it.  .
3.0,The stone itself was beautiful.  But the metal the holds its is not very secure it's a bit flimsy.  The stones has come loose a few times you better off buy a least expensive one I bought for my son!
3.0,"I've bought Hanes comfort blend socks for years and loved them.  I bought these to replace the last batch, and found them to be rather disappointing.  They are... okay as far as socks go, but are definitely on the thin side.  So if you are used to the older version, you will find these rather underwhelming."
3.0,tight around chest
3.0,Nice material but way too big.
3.0,xmas gift - hope she likes it
3.0,"I didn't care for this one. I am 5 feet 4 1/2 inches tall, 135 pounds and I don't think it's flattering on my curvy build. I think this dress would be very nice on a fuller woman or a taller woman. I couldn't pull it off. I belted it and it was okay, but still, not exactly flattering. I wear it around my apt. Very comfortable in the winter months. I noticed that the fabric sheds a bit. It can be shaved with a razor. So again, not for me, but I think plenty of other beautiful women may be able to pull it off!"
3.0,The amount of fabric is short. But for the price it can be revamped
3.0,Have to get it taken up because it is just to big.
3.0,The dress is really cute.  The girls liked it.  But first time worn the skirt tore at the waist.  She is not a rough and tumble girl.<br /> Just fragile material.  It tore while she was taking it off.
3.0,Very well made but does run small make sure you order a size up
3.0,"metals pieces seem solid, they used good nylon, but does not fit me comfortably, i have to struggle to get it on my 8 in wrist"
3.0,"The extra page in the center is handy, but the plastic comes away from the seams after a few wears. Used for LARP."
3.0,Didn't provide the support that I expected.
3.0,"This was an interesting little dress. I absolutely loved the sleeves and lace additions. It did kind of give me a funeral vibe though... Not that I minded that too much.<br />It was a bit tight, but stretchy. I am returning, but may consider ordering up.<br /><br />For reference, I typically wear a L/XL in tops and size 15in bottoms. I am pear shaped (I think) with a 36C bust. I'm 5'6 and 185lbs."
3.0,"I am 5'2"" with a 32DD usually wear a size 6 or 8. I sized by chest size to purchase. The chest fit perfectly but the waist & sleeves were unflattering and baggy. Not a good look for a body suit."
3.0,It pinches under my armpit and the band trends to roll over because there's is no underwire. But my girls are snug and don't bounce around...so that's a plus
3.0,Nice Chain
3.0,So small and not the best picture quality but my niece loves them still… about the size of a quarter…
3.0,"I purchased these to hold on my tummy and they did that, a little too well. Lower back started hurting even though they didn’t feel all that tight. Great quality, but needs to offer a size larger or would purchase a larger size if offered. As it stands, xl is really probably a large at best. Love the pockets and material."
3.0,Was not like pictures disappointed
3.0,Loose braclets; one was broken
3.0,I thought they would be a little longer
3.0,The cotton fabric makes it comfortable. I wish it was a bit longer.
3.0,The shirt fit well but the sleeves are too small and ripped. I bought a medium. I'm going to try to contact the seller to get it resolved.
3.0,"My husband said that it does what it's supposed to do (covers his ears), but will only wear it doing yard work because it makes him look too much like a puppy dog."
3.0,much tighter fitting than I was expecting. I was looking for a looser shirt to workout in
3.0,Im a 42DD in bras. So i got the largest size. I think for the most part they fit decent. But at the same time fit a little small. Very comfortable though I promise you that.
3.0,"I ordered a size 7 and it was probably two sizes too big!  It fit very loose and my toes can go all the way to the front edge of the slipper.  Other than the size issue, the quality is okay for the price.  I don't anticipate it to last for more than a year and I think it serves as a house slipper."
3.0,If you have full breasts this dress is not for you
3.0,"Ears are cute, tail was made for a child"
3.0,It's a bit fragile and not marked as real silver. Came in a plastic bag and a cloth bag.
3.0,I bought two and one is doing great but i noticed my blue bracelets string is falling apart...down to merely a thread. Not sure why when I were them all the same.
3.0,They where ok but the glar of the laptop was bad
3.0,coat arrived fast.  Coat is exactly what I wanted except for the fact this is not a mans coat it's a woman's coat.  The zipper is on wrong side it zips like ladies clothing.  If your a guy DON'T BUY this.!!  Michael
3.0,Pretty decent brightness and great modes but the wireless controller wasn’t controlling it at all. The hood portion imo is too small
3.0,"The weird, shiny material and strange waistband were a little disappointing. They're pretty unattractive. To be fair, the weather turned cold around the time these arrived so I haven't worn them really yet. Perhaps they are the most comfortable pants ever and I don't know it? Either way I doubt I'll wear them out of the house."
3.0,Shirt is too long.
3.0,Regular quality.
3.0,I like the style and feel but can't keep the clip at the bottom from coming open.  I will keep it as a backup.
3.0,"This product was way too right and short, and the lace was completely unforgiving. I have it three stars because it may just be my body type that could not fit into it. I usually wear a small, but because i am so tall and have a big butt it is a regular problem for me to find dresses that are long enough."
3.0,"Very easy to get scuff marks. every time i have bumped into anything, marks appear and wont rub out. Also maybe i just cant figure it out but the watch has groves in it making be believe it is resizable but for the life of me I can not tighten it around my wrist."
3.0,Although I like the shape and texture of this pendant  I was disappointed by how tiny it is<br />I am not a big person but I feel this  pendant is gear more for a child or teenagers
3.0,Excellent except for sizing.
3.0,We have four pairs of these socks and they are easy to put on (not as much compression as other socks which is nice). However I only gave three stars because 2 socks developed holes in the toe immediately. See picture above.
3.0,"My daughter loved the muted pink color of this bikini as shown in the pictures, but the one she received is a true pastel pink that is identical to like baby shower pink.  It just made it seem too babyish to her and didn't work with her complexion.  But the fit is amazing and she loves the top.  She is thinking of pairing it up with another bikini bottom.  So as long as you are okay with a baby shower pink and not the muted mauve pink, this is a great bikini for the price."
3.0,"The dress was pretty, quality was decent, but it was also too big. I bought a small I am 5'3"" and weight around 110 lbs and it was just too loose. The chest area was kind of weird."
3.0,"This pants looks nice and fashionable (except I don't care for that ""patch"" design on the knees) and feel nice but they are definitely not waterproof, they are little short and the BELT was MISSING!"
3.0,It's cute and comfortable but a bit stiff. If it was more form fitting in the waste it would be dashing bit since it's not it make the wear look a bit bulky
3.0,Not great quality but ok for the price.
3.0,Arrived today on time pretty color I got myself blue<br />But I ordered a size bigger<br />Be cause I hate tight fitting<br />Oops!!<br />Way big especially on top<br />Falls off shoulders bottom fits pretty good though
3.0,Of course it won't hold up against time because it isn't real gold. But you def get your money's worth. I've showered in it twice as well and it hasn't tarnished. Update: the gold never tarnished and it’s been a few months. That was great but the chains broke quickly. I’m purchasing again because it’s nice quality and I’ll just take better care of the chains!
3.0,Cute but is paper thin and runs very small.
3.0,"Not sure what land this XL is for, but, ...no USA."
3.0,Big frame
3.0,"This bracelet is OK to wear for a night out at a dimly lit bar. It's very cool and goes with a lot of night on the town wear, especially jeans. The main problem I have with this bracelet is that the silve-like parts  on it is very cheap looking. Also it seems impossible task to fasten this bracelet by yourself. This was a little too much to pay for this item."
3.0,Too big for me.  I ordered one size bigger following several reviews and boots were too big for me.  As I live in Argentina I kept them.  It was  too complicate to return them but I find these boots rather uncomfortable.  What a pity!!
3.0,nice overall wish it flared out a little bigger
3.0,"I'm 5'1 and around 104 lbs.  The dress fit well everywhere except in the mid section it bunched up weirdly.  Also, while the dress is pretty I felt like it looked a little juvenile for an adult.  Would be a great dress for high school homecoming."
3.0,I order a XL. The shorts were too big. The shirt was not a ruffle it was not cute at all.
3.0,Quality... Meh
3.0,"This was a really cute suit. I followed the advice of other reviews and ordered a bigger size. The bottoms fit great, but no matter how I tried to adjust the top I couldn’t keep the girls contained. I ended up returning."
3.0,A little chip matirial but good for the price
3.0,Very very tiny pants. My sis is 5'9 and thin (she's about a size 6) & these were way too small. They fit my 9 year old niece. They are long on her but the waist is perfect.
3.0,some come dead while others are dim but for the price you cant expect much. I've moved on to a more professional light thats not so bulky.
3.0,These earrings are super cute but too big!  They basically cover up my second hole.
3.0,I am writing a review on this product because I purchased both the women's version and the men's version. Both orders were 102 pairs as advertised. Beware - you don't even get everything that is pictured. I received all liner socks. These were in black and in white. I did not receive the dark grey ones pictured.
3.0,"When  you zip coat up or down zipper will get into material, I did not like this, other than that it is a good item."
3.0,"The costume was pretty cute except for the ""stockings."" They only went up to my knees and I am not tall. Just 5'4"". And they rolled down. So I could not wear the stockings at all. They looked stupid. It was pretty cute without them. But I don't think they should be shown as mid calf stockings in the image because unless you are like 4 feet tall, they are not going to go up to your mid or upper calf."
3.0,"First of all, the basics - cut, fit, and construction. All of them are at least adequate. The material is a reasonable lightweight cotton-linen blend. The weave is tight, and the thread is consistent with no significant slubs. The cut is as expected, which I've come not to expect from clothes bought online :) The dye was applied evenly and doesn't seem to have bled out during the first wash. Stitching is alright but not as tight or as even as it could be. The shirt is attractive enough and should bear up well.<br /><br />Now we come to the ""corners cut"". First of all, this is a nice enough shirt, but it is NOT a traditional guayabera. It isn't long enough to hang over the pants as far as it should when worn untucked. It lacks the traditional pockets on the lower front corners. And in a somewhat cheesy move they removed the expected pleats and replaced them with applique strips. It makes ironing easy, but it's just not a guayabera.<br /><br />If they'd advertised it as a shirt it would have gotten a higher rating. But they called it something it's not."
3.0,"I love them !! but a little bit of water change color , can’t wear them anyore."
3.0,The arms were too small.  I can still wear the top.
3.0,I really like this cloak as a scarf. It's a bit short and a lot thinner then I was excepting. I bought a cloak clasp to go with it but the fabric is so light it couldn't hold it properly.
3.0,The pink and black ones fit well.  The blue ones are too tight and are shorter than the others.  Cannot wear them because they are so tight they cause cramping
3.0,"I was different than I had expected.  But, it's OK."
3.0,"They're a size small, but still too big"
3.0,"This dress was awesome but I got it in mocha and I ended up returning it because it looked like I was wearing a khaki colored sack. It fit better than a sack but the color was just blah. A little long for me but if I had kept it I would have hemmed it, I'm 5'3&#34; and it was past my heels.<br />Everything else was great except the color!"
3.0,"Nice price and brilliant idea, however, you get what you are paying for, less than a month of owning this one,the connection was detached, I have to find another band. I didn't abuse it or force anything. it just falls apart.<br />This fits the way Fitbit is all about, great functionality, low price device but won't last."
3.0,"As noted by other reviewers, 1 bag can hold a pair of women's sandals or slippers, but it takes 2 bags for a pair of women's walking shoes."
3.0,"Third time I ordered this product and the quality gets worse with each other. The tanks are so thin and product very little compression. I ordered a small, and it still fits loose."
3.0,"These pants are a couple sizes too small or maybe more. The leg holes are also tiny. I give them 3 stars as if you have pencil legs and order a couple sizes up, they were soft. Didn’t get to try them outside though. I’m a US size 6 and felt like a children’s size."
3.0,"Works well as a duffel bag.<br />Warning, the shoulder strap will break if the bag is overpacked more than halfway. I would recommend another sturdier bag if you plan to really  fill it up or travel often.<br />For the occasion trips, this will do the job and looks great!"
3.0,These scarves are nice but polyester us polyester.
3.0,Collar should be lined. Runs small
3.0,"I liked the item, but when I purchased based on the size chart it was just way too big, I sent it back. Will more than likely order another one...but being in Florida ...its to hot to think about this item yet."
3.0,"order 1 or 2 sizes larger than you normally would, I ordered 1 size larger than I normally wear and it is still a little snug on me"
3.0,"Pretty color but fit a bit small on me: 32D, 5'10&#34;, regularly sized 8-10 (M) on Amazon. My biggest complaint is that the white sewn-in slip shows at the edges where the fabric crosses over. Small or not, any time you move the white part will flop open."
3.0,"I like the color of this bag but the material looks cheap and smells strongly of chemicals.  I've had it for a month now and the smell is only beginning to go away.  But the bag is quite roomy and the color is a true hunter green - just be aware that you're not paying much for this purse, so you're getting what you pay for."
3.0,Good for youngsters...
3.0,Fit fine but according the the picture it’s not a flat bill hat it looked like a regular curved hat which is what I wanted. If you like the flat bill then it’s a good hat. Should have explained it better in the description.
3.0,"Not what I expected, but will work. Fabric is cheap good for a season."
3.0,it is nice but not good material
3.0,Daughter liked but gold scrapes off easy.
3.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up and it was an okay fit. Not flattering for a shorty like me I think.  I am returning. Also, mine didn't come with a bow. Didn't even realize it was supposed to have one till writing this review."
3.0,These are not as long as the picture shows.  I'm only 5'3&#34; and they came just above my knees.  They stretch out easily and I had to pull them up several times.
3.0,"Arrived a couple of weeks after ordering.  Not impressed with these gloves, even though the description says fleece-lined, they do not keep your hands as warm as other thinsulate Isotoner gloves I've had.  I will wear them for milder weather (temps &#62; 32F) but not that happy with them."
3.0,The material feels durable and it's so comfortable.
3.0,"Nice in general but sized small, and went by their directions for sizing."
3.0,Poor quality.  These slippers will maybe last 30<br />Days
3.0,"its a great set, but it has a few pieces that are removable that are very delicate, and there is no parts available to fix it, so if you are picki about it like me, then you wont be happy when it happens"
3.0,"TOO LARGE FOR ME, AND ARRIVED WITH NO INSTRUCTION OR INFORMATION."
3.0,"Used the seller's size chart. It was good for chest and shoulders, but the shirt felt uncomfortably short. Given the all-cotton material, I'm sure the shirt would have been unwearable."
3.0,"Theses are ok. I ordered them solely based on the color in the picture,  which is the color in my daughter's softball team uniform.  They aren't the bright green in the picture  but more a pale lime color.  Not bad, but not what is pictured.  I thought I had ordered a large but got an xl. That could have been my mistake. They have a drawstring,  so not a huge problem,  but a large probably would have been better  as the shorts are loose.  They are comfortable  and lay nicely but will require ironing,  which I hate doing, because they are very wrinkly. For reference,  I'm 5'6, 170lb athletic build.  I usually wear an 8 or a 10 in pants. 30in waist and 41 inch hips."
3.0,"I see orange spots developing after just a week of wearing, so don't know how &#34;real gold plated&#34; it actually is."
3.0,It looks very cute but it runs a little big.  In 2 washes the blouse was in peaces.  Not well stitched on
3.0,"Need to clarify the sizes. The size I ordered (6) is close fitting, was not aware of which size would fit comfortable."
3.0,"They're cute, but the lenses aren't colored which is what I was after"
3.0,I ordered a size 7 and they sent me an 8 so I had to return and reorder . I have never understood why western chief rain boots have foot insert pads that always come out and why they don’t glue them in. Who wants to keep adjusting and putting the insert back in place every time they put on the shoe yet they have never improved or fixed this issue over the years. It’s not much of a padded insert to begin with so I end up throwing it out . My experience is that  Western chief shoes are usually only good for 1 season and then they are just junk or get a tare and leak .
3.0,This fit nice but was supposed to be a cheetah print trim and it’s not it’s definitely just brown stripped but it’s still cute I just wanted the cheetah trim as pictured
3.0,I wish that Oakla would bring back their original space dye material. It was stretchy and soft and moved with your body. This product is okay. I’m not fully happy. It’s fine.
3.0,"La tela se ve de mala calidad, lo<br />Que implica que la pileta tendrá una corta vida útil. Considerándomelo anterior el artículo es muy caro para su calidad"
3.0,"It’s ok, the material is not breathable though."
3.0,Cute and light weight<br />But the waist band is just a piece of elastic attached in 2 places and the elastic will be direct on the skin.
3.0,"The side stones fell out very quickly. It's on my toe, so it's not that big of a deal."
3.0,Really small charm
3.0,This was a gift and the receiver loves it.  It's very expensive...for the item.  Just my opinion!  For true fans!
3.0,Smaller than I expected.  But my friend really liked it.
3.0,"These are definitely made for bigger bags and not for an overnight bag. While they hold a good amount of clothing, I did not find a suitable bag for cosmetics in the set and had to rely on something else. I was fortunate that I drove instead of flew this trip as I could not close my overnight bag due to the size of the packing cubes and I am in the market for a smaller set for shorter trips. The fabric was cute and I fell for the flamingos and pineapples but will not purchase this item again."
3.0,Too long:(
3.0,also return it
3.0,Decent shirt but not like the old Kirkland shirts. This one was a little wider and has a pattern on it. Not bad but disappointing if you’re expecting one of the older shirts.
3.0,"Good quality, heavy, very easy to install. Overall I would recommend. Does not come with the frame, just the band.<br /><br />Warning! Super short length.  I am a normal size man and I could barely even get it over my hand never mind close he clasp.  I will be returning it."
3.0,I wear medium but it was somewhat big on me. The material is also kind of heavy too. To me this dress is just okay.
3.0,"I like the look of it and it is very practical! The chain looks cheap though and there are scratch marks inside. Also, it is not the easiest to put a picture in."
3.0,Quality is not good. Its thin and smelly.
3.0,It's a good fit.<br />Looks cheap. I'm going to take out the shoulder pads.
3.0,"Solid color, no labels showing. Aesthetically pleasing in their simplicity, but they run a bit on the small side. I'm a size 10 wide, and they were too snug all around. Uncomfortable and noticed them all day long.<br /><br />So if your feet are slightly smaller than average, they should be fine. If you're larger than a size 9, I'd look elsewhere."
3.0,"It is pretty, but for the price, next time I will just make my own.  it's just not that fantastic for the price."
3.0,"Cute necklace, but it was delivered tangled as horse 🐴 hair. If it can be detangled than it can last for two or three months. If you are a person that sweats heavily than the necklace will probably last one to two months. The necklace is light weighted, but cute."
3.0,"I love the softness, fit and function of this. I bought it in yellow and didn't want to take it off after trying it on. However, I just bought it and it pilled on the side panel after one wearing. Also, it had a tremendous amount of lint which got all over a nice pair of black running tights, and the black shirt I wore underneath of it, after washing it. I have never seen a fleece be linty like this. I'm hoping the lint goes away (I just washed it again to address that) and that the pilling doesn't continue."
3.0,These shorts are a weird material. They’re not not comfortable but for sleeping I’d prefer something softer/cotton. Also whatever these are is soooo STATIC clingy. It’s crazy. These run big I got a medium I’m a 28/29 in jeans and these are huge on my waist they slide down and don’t stay up so I wish I would have sized down.
3.0,It looks beautiful but after just two days fur peeled off
3.0,They are quality sun glasses but run big. They do not stay on my face or head if I put them up.
3.0,Just received my order and the necklace is NOT pink it is a light ORANGE.
3.0,"A well designed and nicely built wallet  BUT the elastic straps lost there memory and  became loose very quickly.<br />You can change the setup of the wallet to have 1 or 2 money clips and or 1 or 2 money straps.  The wallet is engineered with a groove under the faceplate so that the money strap doesn’t go around the entire wallet you simply unscrew the faceplate, add the strap then replace the faceplate . Initially The wallet holds cards pretty well.<br /><br />The wallet seems a little thick but it is definitely solid<br />I definitely prefer pushing the cards up with the cutout and fanning the cards out,  apposed to pushing them out then pinching one end and trying to select a card, like they show in there video ,the whole process feels awkward<br />The money clips don’t stick out too far and they press down firmly BUT unfortunately unless You have a lot of bills they really don’t hold the cash at all , it simply sides out<br />At first I thought the strap that holds everything together seemed well made BUT it stretched in a couple of weeks leaving everything loose  It would be nice If the elastic strap was a little wider letting you fan out the cards easier without having to worry about the other end popping out on occasion<br />Fortunately they honor there lifetime warranty without any issues at all. The Cash straps have little rubber dots that secure the cash in place relatively well<br /><br />Overall the design is good , it doesn’t feel cheap but unfortunately the elastic straps didnt last at all and I returned it"
3.0,I like the quality and value but most are too large
3.0,Hubby loves this shirt. So much he wouldn't let me return it. It unfortunately had pen marks on a few of the white areas of the shirt
3.0,"These were listed as being plated with white gold, but arrived in a box proclaiming they were 100% sterling silver.  A pity, because the earrings are cute but I'm allergic to them.  So they get to live in their box.."
3.0,"The dress is very pretty and flowy, however, be prepared to do some adjustments because the top and the skirt are very open. I’m going to have to pin the top and pin, or figure out something to go underneath, the bottom lest the wind blow and everyone see my lady bits on Easter morning. Also, as you can tell from pictures, this dress wrinkles very easily. It appears to be one of those effortless looking dresses that requires a lot of effort. 🤔 Weighing whether it’s worth the hassle."
3.0,"Gorgeous dress! Great material, but unfortunately way too big for me. I need to get it tailored 😕"
3.0,Did not care for the color. U ordered pink. Also these do not fit very well.
3.0,"I purchased this dress in navy in a size large. I'm normally a medium, sometimes a large in shirts, but wanted this to be flowy and comfy on me and went with the larger of my normal size range. For reference, I'm 5'3&#34;, 155, and a 34D. I ended up sending this item back because I didn't like the way it looked on my body. I found that the area along the hips where the pockets lay kind of stuck out and made my hips look bigger. I may have been able to remedy that by going up another size, but I'm unsure and didn't really want to order another just to be disappointed. I may keep it in mind for the future, though.<br />The dress itself is okay. The material is cheap, thin, and very stretchy. I did find that it clung like that sort of material tends to do and it will show both bra and panty lines, no matter what you wear. I could see the black being cute, but unless you are very lean and don't mind panty lines (thong included), you may want to steer clear or order a size or two up."
3.0,"Fit was good. BUT the crotch was sewed crooked, very badly made. I kept to wear around house because they are thin enough for hot weather."
3.0,I liked it at first . Its comfortable but not the best material . It could be softer on the inside . I got this while being pregnant just to have something lounge around in .nothing to special
3.0,"I like the light weight of them, I just wish they fit on my nose better. They are hard to adjust because they are very thin and I dont want to break them."
3.0,"These earnings clip on, but they're not clip-on earnings. They sort of stay on..."
3.0,Good value bit shorter than expected
3.0,Honestly not the best quality but it doesn’t bother me much. Cute glasses. You get what you pay for
3.0,"This product was much, much smaller than anticipated. I wear a medium in most tanks and ordered a large just in case, but the size I need in these is an XXL."
3.0,Very very pretty but the range is too small. When I use it I look silly.
3.0,I love the way this dress fits but was a little disappointed in the fabric pattern.  It was not centered in the front as it is pictured so I don't feel like I can wear this to anything other than very casual events.
3.0,Thought it would keep my feet warmer but good enough.
3.0,"it is way too small.<br />my kid is almost 7, but really fit a 6y. I bought a 6y, but it looks like it's for 5 years old."
3.0,"Neck cut weird, not straight and theres a weird piece that sticks out. Mesh is good quality though"
3.0,"For some reason, this size large is a little bigger than the other size large item on the same order."
3.0,Was disappointed it did not make it on time it was very late but still a good product
3.0,"They are just cheap $1 magic stretch gloves with a leather emblem sewn on them. I thought they would be higher quality for $15.  They stretch and fit fine, just not what I was expecting."
3.0,Like the design but not the order
3.0,"These earrings are quite large, larger than I expected."
3.0,"I ordered grey and what I received with cinderella looking blue. The material looked thick and good, but I just didn't like the color in it. I ended up donating it because I didn't get around to returning it soon enough."
3.0,"This dress has a lot of potential, but just didn't hit the mark. I bought an XL which I shuffle between that and L depending on the make of the dress. It was very low cut and the length was pretty short and I'm only 5ft. It doesn't have much stretch. I would have considered swapping for a large, but I can't imagine it would be long enough."
3.0,Smaller than expected. Still feels pretty sturdy for the price.
3.0,"It's cute the the torso is so incredible short. And I'm 5'2, so I can't imagine how short the torso would feel on a woman of average height. But it's cute and is pretty good quality."
3.0,"I think the gold is too much in the light, it looks awesome under dim light. It is pretty short from the back. I ordered a XL & unfortunately is snug on me. :( I'm 155lbs."
3.0,"The material seems nice, but the socks run big...however it kept on falling of my foot when I was doing some floor excise. Maybe it is just not for me."
3.0,"I do not know what this is made out of, but it is NOT cotton.<br /><br />I am editing my review because they seller is doing everything possible to make my buying experience a happy one. Much appreciated!"
3.0,Asian sizing I believe.  Not as roomy as I'd hope
3.0,"If you have a larger face and want more coverage from the nose to chin, this one will not fit well."
3.0,They are cute but cheap
3.0,Beautiful but unfortunately bralette runs very small
3.0,I bought this for my two girls. Great price especially for two girls that are becoming teenagers. They where well made and withstands the hyperemesis of my youngest.
3.0,The bottom is too long & full. I'm 5' 4&#34;
3.0,"They’re so pretty and I thought I did enough research, but you still need pierced ears for these. Considering getting my ears repierced just to wear them. 😩"
3.0,Not as loose as expected
3.0,"This is basically like wearing a tube sock, material and all. It’s cute maybe for a Halloween costume, or more casual setting"
3.0,"My skin is sensitive and I was disappointed to find the band to be rough and chaffing. This may not be the case for all purchasers. Otherwise, the purchase was as represented."
3.0,I got a large and it was to big
3.0,received product on time and looks just like the picture. I ordered an XL large because some people said it was made small. I tried it on and the bottom fits perfect but the cut size was too small.
3.0,I received my product quickly but I did not get the dream charm. I got two hopes. So I will be contacting the shop. But they are super cute.
3.0,Too clingy.  I was hoping for a more flowing t-shirt style.
3.0,"They are okay when you need backings, and I always do. They did not produce allergic reactions and fit most earraings, though not all."
3.0,Queda bien pero muy clara
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she didn't have it on her wrist for a full day with the metal rope holding the charms broke. Really nice looking but cheaply made."
3.0,"I want to like this jacket but it's not without its problems, namely the zipper.  First off, it's backwards.  Every coat I've ever warn puts the zipper on the right side but not this one.  Second, the zipper has already separated on me once on the second use.  I was able to get it back together but it shouldn't have happened.  I'm honestly afraid the zipper won't last.  With a base layer on between 45-50F I had to leave it mostly unzipped to cool off so it seems to be pretty warm."
3.0,"I wanted to try these primarily for use while working out and exercising.  After hearing a radio advertisement, I thought these were worth a try considering their innovative design to emphasize support and comfort. I had been using traditional boxers for my exercise regimen, and the access slit in the front was a problematic feature of the casual-wear boxers. I hoped these Frigo mesh boxers would solve that problem, while offering the other benefits as advertised.<br /><br />As purchased, this item was professionally boxed and arrived with an informational instruction card explaining the suspension system perfectly. I was pleased to see that the brand name on the waistband was smaller and more stylized than in the photo in the Amazon listing. I mention this because I dislike the trend of undergarment manufacturers who place their name in large bold letters all around the waistband. Although I cannot fault them for advertising on their product, I have always preferred that undergarments be as sterile and devoid of attracting attention as possible, should any aspect of them accidentally become visible outside of a changing room or a bedroom. The sizing information is in the back inside of the garment, and this does have a slightly odd feeling when worn due to the applied print not being as elastic as the base fabric. The inside of the leg hem incorporates a rubber banding to help secure the lower edge to the legs, and I could see where some customers (especially those with large thighs and/or much hair) would find this feature uncomfortable. Having worn bicycling shorts, the gripping bands do not bother me, and I find they help the general function of the garment.<br /><br />The paramount distinguishing feature of this garment is the suspension system incorporated into the design. This is a simple design with a seemingly simple method of adjustment through buttons and an elastic tape with buttonholes. Although elementary in concept, the actual process of adjusting these proved to be a humbling experience. I am mechanically inclined, have done numerous challenging tasks with small items (repairing antique pocketwatches, removing splinters under a 15x power microscope, painting award-winning miniature figurines) and yet the adjustment of these buttons and elastic straps proved to be more difficult than anticipated. I found that adjusting the fit of these is more easily achieved when not wearing the garment, and I was also wishing I had the hands of a 5-year-old and the patience and precision of a neurosurgeon to accomplish the task. It required numerous trips to the restroom to change the settings, and my coworkers at the office assumed I had a stomach bug and kept their distance from me for a few days during that time.<br /><br />The first day I wore these, they proved to be very comfortable after I readjusted the strap and button settings a few times. But I also spent nearly all of that day on my feet, either walking or standing. 14 hours of wear on that first day, and I was very pleased with my purchase.  I believed I had achieved the optimal comfort setting by the end of the day.<br /><br />The comfort dramatically changed for the worse on the second day of wear. On that day, I was constantly on the move and I was frequently sitting at a desk. This proved problematic, as the ideal setting for the suspension is different for being in the sitting position. Every time I would stand and sit, there was some discomfort which often required me to invest a few moments into readjustment of the buttons and straps. When the settings are too loose, the suspension is like a slack hammock and there is no proper support. When the settings are too tight, the effect felt somewhat like a noose in a very sensitive area. I ended up bypassing the suspension mechanism entirely, which actually reduced the garment's ability to produce the cooling effect. That second day of wear is when I hoped to test this garment out in the gym after work, but instead I hurried home to change out of these, and to pause for an hour of quietness and meditation while I silenced the screams that had deadened my mind throughout the day. The discomfort experienced on that second day caused me to lose focus on nearly everything external, as my mind was distracted every time I would sit down.<br /><br />The third time I wore these, I waited to change into them immediately before my workout due to the previous day's discomfort. I was especially curious to see how these would work, as I do some kicking as part of the exercise regimen. Before the kicking, I had forgotten about the necessary sit-ups, and those proved to be just a little bit on the uncomfortable side of awkward. The garment had good support, as advertised, but when in the course of performing a sit-up, once the torso pivoted closer to the vertical position, there was a bit of an upward pull sensation which caused a mild gasp of astonishment each time. Had there been more sit-ups on that day, or had they been at a faster pace, I do not think I could have proceeded as internally it felt a little like the suspension had become a trampoline. After that experience, the subsequent kicking was much easier in this garment, and that is really why it was purchased in the first place. 1.5 hours of wear on that day, and they fulfilled the purpose for which they were purchased.<br /><br />My greatest concern with these is the change in comfort experienced when one sits down from being in an upright position. I hope that I can understand the proper optimization of the straps so I can consider this as a valued garment in my wardrobe, but for now they will only be used for short intervals, preferably ones where I am not in a sitting position during that entire time."
3.0,"That metal medallion was going to cause pant wear because I am a left pocket guy. So, I had to remove the medallion which left holes."
3.0,"Product is OK but is not the same as the original. Will never order again where product travels through customs, took way to long for item to arive."
3.0,"The stones look like real Amber and the silver is very pretty. However, the necklace does not lay flat against my neck.  The stones keep turning over. The bracelet is very nice."
3.0,Thin material. Run small. Not for curvy hips. These are ok. Don’t absolutely love but keeping them.
3.0,"Its not as soft as I would have liked, it's more rough and crinkly. I saw cheaper ones at Walmart with a better fabric texture. Maybe I will return this one."
3.0,Wash well!  I wear the heck out of them!  Very comfortable for around the house style
3.0,"The dress looked great but was a little bigger than I expected. It still worked for the occasion. The blue was very bright, which is why I included both photos. The material was a little itchy and cheap feeling, but ""it's painful to be beautiful."" The dress served its purpose, and I'm pleased overall."
3.0,Surprisingly heavy & bigger than expected. It had a bit of fray on the leather that I could see worsening after a few adjustments.
3.0,"Cute fashion accessory, probably not long wearing, but not too concerned since price was so reasonable"
3.0,"You get what you pay for.  Material is ok, but don't expect to wear it forever.  Also the sizes are extremely on the small side (coming from Asia) so order larger than you would think."
3.0,"Very weird feeling, not soft material<br />It was too big"
3.0,Loved the amulet but it broke off the cord after about 4 months
3.0,Gorgeous shoe that I cannot walk in. And I always manage to scruff up the heels. Sigh.
3.0,"Recently i decided to try out this top selling wetsuit in the waters of the Northern California, which current temperature is around 55F (13C). It keeps me warm enough for the 4-5 hours of surfing and i'd be very happy with it, but...<br />The wetsuit's zipper consistently becomes unzipped and full of flushing in water. It's not that i don't zip it right at first point, it's a matter of bad design.<br />The second problem is terrible neck irritation that happens cause of the same top part of the suit that supposed to keep the zipper up and don't let any water in through your neck. It fails both and leaves rush on my neck after every surf day, so i had to order an rush guard with protected neck, which adds extra $32 to fix at least one of the issues. Btw, I've never had any of such problems with QuickSilver's Cypher that i used to rent before."
3.0,"Too large, the quality is acceptable"
3.0,Its big on me .. material is poor quality
3.0,"its a really nice hoodie but the picture shows pastel colors, the one i got just seems just saturated in color like they just soaked it. its not sharp like the picture at all."
3.0,"The automatic functions are ok,  I bought a second one with a steel strap.  It works.  It’s two minutes fast every two days. But it works."
3.0,These are a little thin for an “outdoor” sock. Comfortable and good looking no doubt. I decided to keep these as dress socks as I don’t feel they would hold up well with my version of “outdoors use.”
3.0,"If you are looking for a white hat depicted, this isn't it. Stuffed in the box, hope I can iron out. Hand made quality, runs a little large."
3.0,"The delivery time is late. The ear-clip is smaller than I thought and not very detailed like in the picture. It’s kind of flat and not really stick to your ear. The size is recommended for people who has small ear-size. However, it’s pretty when you wear it."
3.0,"The fact that the back piece is removable the airtag can fall out , there’s no locking mechanism , however it’s a great looking product"
3.0,"I ordered these pants for my 14 year old son, they took forever to arrive. When I took them out of the package they were so small, that I wondered who they were for. I had my 11 year old daughter try them on and they just fit her. They seem to be of good quality, but do not stretch at all, which could get uncomfortabe at the waist , they seem quite stiff."
3.0,Very pretty and very delicate. Too bad it arrived knotted up. It's going to take me awhile to get the knot out. Hopefully I won't break it in the process.
3.0,The bracelet itself isn't too bad but the stitching is terrible. Right out of the box it already had some threads coming loose near the clasp. The silicone almost looks like leather which is great and the clasp is pretty solid. None of the steel pieces however are fixed into place so everything but the clasp can slide around as you wear it. The band fits pretty well on my wrist so I haven't had any issues with sliding but I can see where others might. It's still a pretty nice looking bracelet for $8 but I doubt it will hold up long.
3.0,"Super cute bag.  Unfortunately, the chain broke the first time I carried it."
3.0,"We ordered this outfit for our daughter for a fall mini photography session. The mustard is a true fall mustard color, perfect depiction in the description. Although the styling was cute, color was accurate, and fabric was soft... this was a cheaply made dress. The hem didn’t quite line up, the buttons were a little loose, with thread coming out. And lastly, there was quite a large malfunction in the threading on the back. Not this best quality."
3.0,My size is always either a 10 or 11 So i ordered a  10 and they were too small. So I ended up having to return them
3.0,Love the shirt just slightly too big
3.0,Pretty but flinsy
3.0,Cute cute dress but not as loose as I had expected. I ordered a M and I would say the fit is snug. I similar dresses and have always ordered a M to have them fit fantastically. This one just fell short. Would order a sz up next time.
3.0,"I love the material, but the dress is a much lighter green than advertised. Also, the off the shoulder look is doesnt really work like its pictured."
3.0,The head bow was not included as stated on the photo..... I will be returning this outfit
3.0,It’s actually really tiny.
3.0,"Its looks great,but clip on band is weak..keeps popping open"
3.0,"ordered 2 colors in the XXL, yellow and blue.  I am an hourglass shape size 12. The yellow is larger in the body, but the arm holes are super small.  I messed around and waited too long to exchange. This dress on me, is &#34;relaxed fit&#34;, which I liked.  I am hoping I can enlarge the arm holes. The Blue one was perfect arm holes, however a full size smaller in the body. If I were 10 years younger, the fit might work. It isn't tight, but quite fitted. The material,on both dresses, nice, comfortable, pretty and good quality. I give it 3 stars due to lack of quality control and the fact that unless I can fix the armholes on the yellow dress, it is unwearable."
3.0,"This is NOT a fedora, it is a trilby. (Using those to terms interchangeably really annoys me.)<br />For the price, I figured I could not go wrong. I chose this hat because of the color and it met those expectations perfectly. The cotton and polyester blend felt kind of cheap compared to my other hats but I got over that pretty quick. But unfortunately, the hat is huge. I was extremely disappointed. I assumed I would never wear it and at $7 with free shipping, it wasn't even worth the hassle of returning.<br /><br />...Then a strange thing happened. I wore it with a navy blazer. white shirt, khaki pants, and brown shoes, turned the mirror, and I looked great! In fact, on my normal-sized head, this oversized trilby almost looks like a fedora. But the darn thing is so big that if I walk too fast it shifts position on my head. I wore it this weekend and got compliments, but a sudden gust of wind almost took my hat away. Fortunately, there is a possible solution; search amazon for &#34;Foam Reducing Tape for All Hats&#34;. I'm going to try that and see if I can salvage this great looking hat."
3.0,Was a bit large and needed to be taken in and hemmed...but I like the overall look
3.0,"I’m 5’10”, weigh about 205lbs and got the XL in the nude/beige. It fit perfectly but the fabric is thin and unforgiving, so it shows every fat roll and ripple. Also, the bottom dragged on the floor and the pockets weren’t aligned properly. Not enough for someone else to notice but enough to be annoying. It’s a cute dress but I don’t want to pay extra to have it altered when I can just return it and use that extra money to buy something higher quality. Good for the right person but it’s not me."
3.0,"These socks are ok in the summer months, but found that they don't protect my feet from blisters well in my long runs.  I only use them for shorter runs in the summer.  I read about them in Runner's World, but they do not hold a candle to my Bridgedales.  I would not recommend to marathon runners, but they would be fine for somebody who runs short distances."
3.0,"Loose fitting over the head, very very thin material tho not see through."
3.0,Top was moreva medium than large... Skirt was tight at band that it rolled down off stomach
3.0,Art work is nice but get a bigger size than u usually would maybe 2
3.0,Wasn't for me but was cute
3.0,I ordered a  medium which is my normal size but it was a little too tight and had to give it to my niece if I ever ordered again I'd order a size up
3.0,"I ordered size M, but it was too big!"
3.0,"These are definitely cheap, but they are sparkly and likeable, but my main beef with them is their choice of a stone for the middle of the snowflake.<br />You can't tell from the picture that the stone is not clear like a rhinestone, but is a very pale light blue. It is dull and very cheap looking. I may<br />try replacing the stone with a clear one and I will be more careful seating it than they were-another reason they look cheap. As they say, you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"The tie belt unraveled after 1 trip through the washing machine. I'm 5'3"" and had to wear heels to keep the hems from dragging the ground. This item is cute and VERY comfortable. I wore it on a recent beach vacation. It served the purpose, but I didn't feel too bad when I tossed it in the trash instead of bringing it home."
3.0,Fits much bigger than expected.. I'm a Medium and I had to downsize to an extra small. Other than that its a great dress.
3.0,"Bearly big enough for my size 13's when they arrived, once washed according to label instructions it took several minutes of fighting to get them on again. Returned."
3.0,"Beautiful material and lace, but huge. Ordered the one size fits all, but the tag says l/xl"
3.0,Good fit in the bottoms.. top was too small with no coverage
3.0,I did not do a good job at reviewing this product. I wear boots that are 6-8 inchs tall. This is for a taller boot. It looks like a well made product. I will return and see if I can find a suitable replacement.
3.0,"Came fast and looks just like the picture. This is for my 13 year old daughter and the told is made for a large bust, it has none removable padding and doesn't lay flat so it's like 2 hollow lumps when she puts it on. It's cute though."
3.0,I wear a 14 or a 16 in most brands. These are a very small 16. The pants themselves are nice. After I lose a few more pounds they should fit and I would like to wear them on the motorcycle. They seem like they would be wind resistant.
3.0,The paper was stuck to the decall and some came off.
3.0,I ordered this set for the earrings which have lever backs and are beautiful.
3.0,Had to have alterations done. The fabric was thin compared to other suits in this price range. The style was nice but in the areas under the arm and in the lower back it puckered outward. I had to dart the puckered fabrics so that it would lay flat against my skin.
3.0,"These are cute...definitely a bit "" loud"", but fun. They are a bit tight at the band which bother my legs after a while. The compression in the rest of the sock is pretty good, yet comfortable.  I just wish the top band wasnt as consticting."
3.0,had to add different padding since the padding it came with looked weird
3.0,"The screen print on the shirt was a little cheap, the sleeves are a little long wish it was made more like a soft  sweatshirt but its thinner.  I will keep it but I also bought one as a Christmas gift for my sister not sure what she will think."
3.0,"The design is ok, mostly like the picture. But I'm a medium in everything i wear and this medium is actually like a small size. So that wasn't great."
3.0,"Fabric is advertised as 95% cotton, which it is not. The label on the dress says 65%."
3.0,"This is a very nice dress and is as pictured however....If you are a size 14/16 and order an XL the bottom will fit but if you wear larger than a 36B bra or size 12 up top this is NOT for you!! It fit ME perfectly because I'm small up the top with a big rear end. A person wearing a 14/16 dress top etc., will NOT be able to get their arms in the dress and button it across the bust line. Also I am 5'3&#34; and it comes to my ankle does not drag the floor, if you are over 5'5&#34; this is not for you!!!!!!!!!"
3.0,"It looked great! Just like the picture. BUT if that's what they call a large, I must be some kind of giant. super sad I had to return it."
3.0,"The fabric is soft, spandexy and very thin. Size runs quite small. Good cut and decently sewn. You will hide nothing beneath this. It clings and is fairly see-through."
3.0,"If you have any sort of booty, don't buy these. They have no room for your butt.<br /><br />Soft and warm though."
3.0,"This is my 3 band like this. The first ones were great. Confmy, smooth and I never had a problem. This one was from a different supplier. It snags on almost everything. I am always adjusting it. It does the job. I may search for a different one next time. Thanks."
3.0,Started peeling within a week.but other than that it’s a great fit since I have a big wrist
3.0,"It's a cute design and my husband was actually excited to wear it, however, he took it off immediately (didn't even show me) because it was too tight.<br /><br />In order to get the right size, I will need to send it back at my own cost and haven't decided if it's worth the additional investment."
3.0,Gloves were way way to big. To hard to use.  Must have big man hands to use them. Look totally cool though.
3.0,La es de calidad buena de acuerdo a su precio. La Correa se despegó a los pocos meses y comenzó a despintarse.
3.0,Great shirt just runs very very small
3.0,I like this belt. Its good for the price. its also reversible. Black on one side and brown on the other.
3.0,It is 2 sizes too small.
3.0,I have had these for about 2 weeks and wear them multiple times a day as a part of traffic control and the reflective tape on each palm is beginning to peel off.
3.0,"Something to wear with the intentional to be comfortable around the house and not caring on the looks too much.<br />The material is silky, stretchy and pretty resistant to the touch. The seams are well programmed, the cuffs are 2"" long at the bottom legs.  The chord at the waist line really helps to distribute the extra material to my preference, which is more in the back and less in the front. Each one of the side pocket is deep enough to fit my hand, or carry my immediate needs.<br />This jumpsuit will require to always wear something under, in addition to the bra, because the arm opening is way too big.  The size L is at its regular proportion and wearing a size bigger for me gives me the relaxed look I wanted."
3.0,Cheap and fake shiney
3.0,"It's a cute, flowy, no-fuss dress that will be perfect for one of those super-hot 90 degree days. The material is very thin and light. It feels like it will rip for nothing - but hey, I've ordered lattes cheaper than this so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />I ordered a medium, which is usually a comfortable size for me (I'm usually a small or medium depending on the style/brand/desired comfort). It's pretty tight around the bust - and I am not a busty lady. Fits loose everywhere else, though."
3.0,muy chico de tiro
3.0,"I bought these pants for work because my server uniform has to include khakis. I'm plus-size, about a size 18-22 on bottom depending on the pants/brand. I do not have problems finding pants that fit ~ but I do when it comes to work pants that actually hold up and can endure bending, friction in the inner thighs, crouching, stretching, etc. The seams fell apart... I could see them begin to have holes in them within maybe 4 wears. In all, the pair lasted maybe 2 months. But that was after mending the seams and only wearing the pants when I had to.<br /><br />Very thin material. Order a size up. I ordered a 3X just in case, although I'm about a 1X or 2X, and it still fit oddly. Too big in the hips and waist area, snug around calfs and ankles. Always had to be worn with a belt for me."
3.0,"The delivery was fine.  However, the hem of the shirt was falling out.  It will need to be resewn."
3.0,"I liked the hoodie. It was really cute. I found that it runs a bit small. I usually wear a medium shirt but ordered the large. The large was an exact fit which was okay. But, the hoodie is made from synthetic material and was a bit warm for me. I live in a warm climate so I wouldn't wear it very much."
3.0,Sadly it looks like a piece of plastic
3.0,"The shirt runs Small. I ordered a large, but it was like a medium. I would recommend sizing up."
3.0,"This purse is nicely made but simply wasn't my style.  I didn't take time and zoom in on this purse, which I wish I had because it was not what I expected. If you like the style then this purse wouldn't be a bad purchase."
3.0,"I do not know where it was stored or which whorehouse come from, but it has a very bad smell."
3.0,"Sorry, had to return it because it fit too snugly around my middle."
3.0,"Dress is too thin. It’s does look like the photo, but with it being so thin it reveals too much."
3.0,"This dress is great. The only downside is that this “navy” dress is black or so close that it is practically black. Please be cautious if you are looking specifically for a navy dress, if you are okay with a black dress that is flowy, feminine, and really a great value, this is the dress!"
3.0,"Nice material, but not cashmere. Good price for a warm neck gaiter. Nice synthetic knit.<br /><br />Got gray and it’s very warm. Stretches easily over head.<br /><br />Getting boyfriend a black one."
3.0,"While this a a great idea these lace are hard to put on the shoes but once you get them on its not bad, but theyare so tight that my son can barely get his foot in his shoes now and he wore them to school and came home with olly 2 laces left so I have no idea what happened to the other ones. I wouldnt buy these again."
3.0,"Fabrics is too thin. I got it to work out in. I would expect these to be form fitting (which they are) but still hold things in just a little. I got a large. I always wear a large. But have lost a little weight and am getting closer to a medium. This shirt fit like a medium, and the fabric is so thin, that it shows every roll, and imperfection."
3.0,"Pro: Super cute, great fit, my daughter loves it.<br />Con: sheds glitter all over the house. My entire family is bedazzled at the moment. As is the furniture, the dog, the walls… it’s not great. Buyer beware!"
3.0,It fit cute but not really the same color
3.0,Doesn't feel like a super high quality. I don't imagine it will last the test of time. But if you're looking at something you're not worried about (looking good) in... it may just keep your head warm.
3.0,Package came totally Wrinkled and is very very thin material
3.0,Reindeer were upside down. Cheaper material. It was OK for the price.
3.0,"I like the length, hitting right around the knee. Very disappointed however to discover the dress was all I got. Package advertises ""detachable cape!"", but there wasn't one in there. No mask, either, but that would at least be understandable. I can grab a red mask and improvise, but I bought this because I didn't want to be bothered with making the cape, so I'm pretty bummed."
3.0,Material on the bottom part made a “swish” sound and wasn’t as soft as it looks.<br />Made little large around waist.
3.0,"Overall ok for the price.  Fabric seems to be durable and will hopefully hold up well with my 5 year old.<br /><br />My one complaint--mirrored by other reviewers: the manufacturer could totally do without the weird wording on the pants: ""Fashion design style without the specifics and tries to be extrsordinsry.""  (Yes, this is literally on the pants, for anyone to read.)<br /><br />A bit ""What the ?!?!?""  I applaud the attempt at being ""cool,"" but, just no.  It really cheapens the quality of the design and makes the pants seem off.  Other reviewers have taken it upon themselves to actually remove that patch on the leg with this, but I really don't want to deal with a craft project when just trying to dress my kid."
3.0,its a little pokey during wear.
3.0,"Checked my order history. Received this watch on July 3rd. Now its, Aug 23rd.<br />The battery died last night.<br />I realize its just the battery, but literally 1 day past when I can return this watch, it quit.<br />To give Casio a (slight) break, with the way Amazon works now, no telling who actually sold me this watch, and no telling how long it has been sitting around.<br />This purchase will make me skeptical and pessimistic of every Amazon purchase in the future."
3.0,"I bought this dress because it appeared to be Teal, instead it's more of a bright baby blue color. Also, the material wrinkles quickly."
3.0,"The dress quality was what I expected for the price, but the waistline hit me very low, and I'm 5'7"". If it had been 2"" higher it would have been just right. I'm returning."
3.0,lightweight not the best fit but good enough for playing dress up with my Granddaughter
3.0,Much smaller and thinner than I anticipated.  But still nice for the price.
3.0,The briefs did not come us as high as expected  and the stitching came apart on the first pair I put on. the second one has held up.
3.0,Super cute but turned by the end of the first day I wore them. 😭
3.0,Unfortunately  the strap is very short
3.0,"I guess a thin fabric is what you want in a summer housecoat/robe, and the pretty navy blue of this fabric means nothing shows through, so you can stay covered up and cool at the same time, but I like more durable fabrics myself in everything but lingerie.<br /><br />This is a pretty house dress that actually shows a V neck in one of its listing photos and a rounded neck in another of its photos. It's as if the seller doesn't really care whether these sell or not. I don't wear house dresses very often, but it was so hot this summer and fall, I was willing to try anything.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't pay careful enough attention to notice that this house dress buttons instead of having snaps or zipping, etc. I can't be stopping to button up a house dress all the way on my way to take the dogs out first thing in the morning!<br /><br />To be fair here, the navy fabric makes it hard to see what's going on in the pictures as far as closing the housecoat. I wore it outside first thing in the morning open over my pajamas or nightie and did just fine.<br /><br />In real life, my housecoat has a rounded neckline and fits true to size. There's nothing flattering about the cut, but it does have longer than normal short sleeves, which I happen to like. I haven't washed it yet for fear it might need ironing, and that's not anything I plan to do very often on a garment I only wear around the house and outside with the dogs.<br /><br />This is a standard housecoat in a pretty navy and white fabric that's thin, but the dark color keeps it from being too thin. Fit is true to size, and the housecoat buttons up the front, which is time consuming before a person has had her coffee and is on her way to take the dogs out.<br /><br />Good product but no better than adequate/good. No more than I wore it - I never have liked housecoats, and I still don't in spite of trying - I didn't have to wash it yet, but I'd imagine it never looks as good again as it does at first. The fabric doesn't appear as if it would hold up for long, and the buttons can always fall off. You can do much better than this."
3.0,"I did not receive an email to put the name and crystal on it,  Therefore, it is pink (ok, since I meant it for me to wear for my daughter) but would have loved her name on it."
3.0,Its cute but it doesn't keep accurate time. the clock moves in the case.
3.0,it was a gift and they seemed to love it???
3.0,"Great for my grandmother, but no so much for me. She liked it and wears it."
3.0,Shirt looks great but definitely isn’t true to size. It fits about 2 sizes too small and the chest is super tight.
3.0,I like it. I got for my boyfriend and I for his birthday. Just wish it was a little bigger. But everything else is okay.
3.0,"Not as pink as the picture, more of a white color"
3.0,Just as pictured the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I didn't receive it on time.
3.0,"Didn't care for the fit of the sleeves, so I returned it. The print was beautiful, though. Pretty good quality!"
3.0,"Soft material, but a bit too see through! Loose fit, so I threw on a belt with it"
3.0,The face size was a little big for me but for the cost it is a good watch.
3.0,"Es igual a foto , pero no me encanto"
3.0,"Add claims the outer material is leather.  It's not.  It feels more like plastic.  The bag looks ok overall, but I don't think it will hold up in the long run.  I was really thinking that this bag would be leather like the add stated and it would hold up.  Kinda disappointed."
3.0,"Great looking watch, but the clasp pops open and watch falls to the ground. I have resorted to putting clear tape around the closed clasp and band."
3.0,Was expecting something a little more substantial.
3.0,The top of the swim suit is good size but the bottom is big<br />They dot fit for the same person body
3.0,"If it gets caught on anything...even the smallest things, it comes loose. I’ve caught it a couple of times but if I don’t, I can see losing it easily.<br />Cool look though and I appreciate the two colors."
3.0,Cute was a hit. Black didn't show the graphics too well tho
3.0,The socks didn't help me with my swelling.
3.0,It broke on day one trying it on. I've put it back together since with tape. It's not what I expected but it's still cool
3.0,"I do like this sweater for the price. It looks more expensive than it is. Pretty details on the front.<br />It fits ok but ran small on me. I am a 40D, broad shoulders, heavy upper arms and it gaps on my chest a bit. The sleeves hit 2 inches above the elbows and it sits an inch or so below the waist, and I am not long waisted. I wish it were longer as it rides up in the back. I sized up to XXL when I am actually an XL in cardigans that button. Everything tends to gap on me so I size up.<br />Material is thin and not very soft. I hope some fabric softener will help."
3.0,No bienen en un correcto kamaño
3.0,Very pretty but posts were wrong guage
3.0,Looks cheap……but overall its ok
3.0,Excellent quality but too thin to be warm.
3.0,Pretty shirt. My daughter in law liked it.
3.0,"Didn't see the gold in picture. Love all the blue tones. Good deal. Came fast. I would recommend to those who like gold in jewelry. I gave three stars, because not a fan of gold."
3.0,Little small.
3.0,"Got this for my husband in his usual size and it is too small for him to wear. It seems to be nicely made, though, and it is a nice looking shirt."
3.0,It’s ok.  The fabric feels nice enough but it’s kindof old lady looking.  I Kindof feel like I belong on the Golden Girls 🤷‍♀️
3.0,I've returned these. They were much too big even though I wear other items from same manufacturer in this 18 and 16.  Pattern not very pretty.
3.0,"Comfortable a great fit, and classy look.  Slightly different color than ordered.  I ordered a blue and got teal."
3.0,I was hopping for mid thigh but they’re a little longer and upper half rolls down when you work out :/
3.0,"Really pretty, but returned because there was a tear in the seam."
3.0,Flattering but doesn't sit well around the chest.
3.0,"Ordered the XL, fits more like a medium/large. Hard to return. I wear a size 38D and both the cup and width was just too small.<br /><br />Otherwise, I can say this is a decent quality top."
3.0,"I love the way this bra looks but hate how difficult it is to take off. There's not much stretch to the material so be prepared to do that cute little ""get this thing off me"" dance. There's also still quite a bit of bounce while working out, so if you're doing some serious cardio, you may want to pass on this. Great for yoga though."
3.0,"The earrings are pretty but the back of the earrings do not click on the back of the earring, the back flips on to the ear and hurts my daughter. They just don’t  Align with the earring area hook."
3.0,"The sunglasses are beautful and fit well on my face, but anytime I looked at my phone it made the screen all stripey and gave me a headache."
3.0,"Came with gold rivets on the cuffs that are not pictured, makes it look more like a costume."
3.0,Pretty but had to return. There was a hole in the pocket and I didn’t like the neck. It constantly stood up.
3.0,Not for thicker thighs. Fits everywhere else.
3.0,"I really thought it was going to be blueish color like the photo but it was dark dark brown,kinda disappointing."
3.0,"It is what it is, I wish it had been a bit wider, or thicker, and the mirror makes it quite heavy, quite satisfied, though , thank you"
3.0,Would give a 5 star rating if it did not carry a tag.
3.0,"Nice shirt & Beautiful color, however, it seems to be irregular. It’s no sewed well. I kept it because my daughter really liked it but the seller or company should do a check on the ítems.  QA is needed.  If it’s irregular, it should be in the description."
3.0,"It’s cute but the size was challenging, didn’t fit as expected so only wore 1x"
3.0,Bought for a cruise.  Not what I was expecting.  Looked frumpy.
3.0,"Not very well made, looks super cute on and spices up and outfit but have to be gentle so I don’t break it"
3.0,My biggest issue is that the stem does not maintain it's shape so I will have to put some cardboard or something in it so it does smushed and deformed.
3.0,"Out of the dresses we looked at this one was my favorite one while shopping online. I was really looking forward to seeing it. I was disappointed in the quality of the dress but I feel that if you had a seamstress make a few adjustments this dress would be amazing! We didn’t have the time to make the needed corrections of the dress before our Vow Renewal Ceremony so It was returned. The color was very pretty. But the sheer blush coloring under the embroidery layer didn’t created a solid color. The zipper seemed a little unpredictable, not sturdy but it did the job. The chest bodice was very large on my daughter and seemed quickly made but for under $50 it’s still a decent deal. They used Velcro for the top connection and not hooks which I did not prefer.<br /> The pictures are right out of the bag so the dress does look wrinkled, and we didn’t have a petticoat to fluff it out.<br /> I will say that this dress would probably photography beautifully. The details will seem not the best quality but I still thought it was an ok purchase if we had more time to make adjustments on it."
3.0,Cute top but it was big. I read others reviews and ordered a size up and am really disappointed that I did because now I have to return it. It is a really cute top otherwise.
3.0,"These pants fit well, have pockets, and were squat-proof, but I was disappointed that the color was so off. I was really looking forward to the teal color advertised in the picture, but the product I got was blue. These pants were everything I wanted, except for the color, so I sent them back."
3.0,Not what I expected. It’s ok for a few uses! But other than that it will start to tear in the seams. Also don’t get White it gets super dirty and hard to clean. Fit was ok overa all I would not buy again
3.0,I was so excited to get this shirt… then it came in and it was the same material and pattern but had completely different buttons… I wanted the nice wood ones that are shown in the photo… but instead I got these giant silver buttons that do not go with the to at all.<br /><br />I’d have to take it to a seamstress and pay $40 to have them re-do the buttons… not worth it.
3.0,Purchased for teenager.  Looks too much like a maternity dress.
3.0,i bought two packs one of the black pair broke but i dont wana deal with sending them back
3.0,"I measured the intended finger as they instructed and it said my measurement was an 11 which is NOT accurate for whatever reason. This ring is very loose and with a shake of my hand falls right off. I cannot wear it as the finger I measured it for is my largest finger. It should have been a 10 to say the least. I do not wish to deal with returns which seems to be more and more common place with Amazon so I will find a welder to cut and fix it as jewlers want more than I even paid for it. Still a beautiful ring though!  Just take care with measurements. Go to a jeweler, they'll tell you your size for free then ask for the measurement and contact the seller to compare."
3.0,"Very rough surface, uncomfortable and flimsy. But are light and economical."
3.0,Nice dress but way to small
3.0,These are ridiculously huge. I know they are supposed to be baggy but this is overboard
3.0,One side of the glass is darker than other side.
3.0,"I would not recommend this item for larger busted women.  Even though it goes to a DD/E, this product doesn't help flatter your figure and flattens you out, may work for B or C cups,  If you give it a try, I recommend going up in size."
3.0,I normally wear a US M I ordered the XL and it fit perfectly. I like the shirt it's cute but the stitching isn't very good button hole area and inseam already has loose threads out the package. I haven't washed it yet but my confidence is low on the longevity of this item. It's ok but probably overpriced based on the quality.
3.0,Wrong size sent twice. Flimsy plastic. When u push in the pin it buckles.
3.0,The build quality wasn't as great as I expected. Looks better in picture then it actually is. Still it was a good purchase nevertheless.
3.0,Looks good but somewhat tight
3.0,These worked awesome for the first month and a half. I absolutely loved them! But this morning one of the little metal ends that holds them in place popped off. Rendering it unusable. Needless to say I’m pretty disappointed.
3.0,"Sleeves were a bit tight, but overall the sizing was larger than I expected. True to size for plus size. The fabric was heavier than I expected. There was a small hole near the shoulder seam that was an obvious mishap in stitching, I was able to fix it, but quality control missed that."
3.0,"These run really small, be sure that you get a pair that are 2 SIZES larger than what you need."
3.0,"I loved how this jumpsuit felt. It was modest and flattering. Perfect for a mom of 4 like me. I ordered the xxl so it would be relaxed and cover my tummy a little.<br /><br />However, I am 5'7 and the pants were a good 10 inches too long. They were dragging on the floor even with my tallest shoes. I can't sew otherwise I would have hemmed the legs up."
3.0,Slips off of my shirt occasionally. Needs a stronger grip.
3.0,"Sadly, where that bottom button is concerned, this shirt is an ""UNBUTTONIT"" as well as an UNTUCKIT.<br /><br />Everything else is primo."
3.0,"Great color, nice fit, comfy material....but smelled horribly like moth balls out of the package!!!!  I washed on hot with a heavy wash cycle with scented detergent and it's fine now....."
3.0,Pants fit a bit weird but top is definitely cute!!
3.0,"Not as ""polished"" as the picture portrays"
3.0,"So, this is a cute shirt, I am tall 5 9 and it is short on me that is all. It fits ok but I wanted the tall girls to know it is a bit short."
3.0,Little too short compare in the picture !!!
3.0,"Nice quality garment, but did not fit. Must be going by some non-American​ sizing - is probably closer to a size 16.  After I got this I ordered a size 7X bathing suit and it fit fine on my American size 20 body."
3.0,Snugg in the waist.
3.0,These are really comfortable. Nice drawstring. Nice to have the slits on the side in case you are having trouble moving while doing yoga. Nice silky material that is really stretchy. Can be worn dressed up I feel like or dress down.
3.0,Probably fine if you want a super short and super tight skort not comfortable or regular size friendly they are almost junior sizings.
3.0,"Fits the way I like, but the material seems to wear. Light, but very warm."
3.0,As it stated I ordered 3 sizes too big and is still somewhat on the small size.
3.0,Fit my husband tight . Order 1 size bigger
3.0,"These are a decent length and have a nice stretch.  My issue with these is around the waist band.  There is nothing helping hold these up or keep them in place.  They would fall constantly and I found myself pulling at them all day long.  Otherwise, the material is great and they are comfortable."
3.0,They are a little tight then I expected them to be.. And when you bend over they are see thru.. Not too good for squats but around town and under a dress I guess.. I really wanted them for working out though.. Kinda bummed.
3.0,Material is cheap and quickly shows wear
3.0,I can not even get my hand in these Socks.<br />I was unable to wear them.<br />Thank you
3.0,"The top part is not meant for anyone with a c cup. This only git my nips I wouldn't wear the top in public unless I didn't want to run, walk, or sneeze. The bottoms had little give in the gold part which made going over my love handles a little stressful. It's a very gorgeous suit but if you have a chest and a little but of love handles I would stay away."
3.0,Ordered a size larger and were way too tight suggest ordering two sizes larger.
3.0,Great cut and material. Love they are double lined. But... too big for my face. They keep falling down and i am adjusting it every 30 seconds or so. Gonna have to see if i can adjust the straps.
3.0,"Looks just like picture , one of my baby sleeves wasn’t all the way sewn"
3.0,"Was hoping they would be better. Not bad, but certainly not what I was hoping for. Better than what came in the shoe, but not by much. Not nearly as ""squishy "" as I thought they would be"
3.0,This boot is very cute but it runs large.  I usually wear a 6-1/2; this is like a size 7 and the heel is a little higher than I expected.  But I like it.
3.0,"is very nice , a see trough fabric"
3.0,I need to return too small
3.0,"Loved the dress and material but the top fit like a medium. One of the reviews I read said they were busty and it fit great. Not so for me. If the top had fit like the lower part of the dress, it would have been a keeper."
3.0,I don&#34;t like the material it is very low quality for the price.
3.0,You get what you pay for with these guys. They are true to picture and color. They touch my shoulder when I tilt my head. They aren't atrociously big but they are pretty big. THEY ARE NOT HYPOALLERGENIC! They irritated my ears to where they almost bleed when I wore them. However I did fix this easily by coating all of the areas in and around my piercing with clear nail polish.  They are lightweight and flexible and I wear them often. Decent product
3.0,"The glasses look cute with the polkadot bathing suit. They are cheaply made, and the reading spot is very low, so I have to push them up while reading."
3.0,"I ended up donating this item to Goodwill because it wouldn't be right for me to return it since it was accurately described.  I have a large wrist and used the first (closest) button to secure the bracelet, but doing so reveals the other 2 silver buttons which makes the bracelet look cheap. This product would be MUCH better if it were simply offered in 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) with just 1 silver button in the necessary place based on size.  This would allow the large size wrist people like me to wear the bracelet without having to see the other buttons showing."
3.0,Comfortable material. Narrow racerback difficult to pull on.  Body very slim fitting.  Would be great for a slim person.  I'm average and it was too clingy for my taste.
3.0,Too snug material didn't really strecth
3.0,"Great price for an accessory for an easy Loki costume! Unfortunately the padding on the inside was peeling off and it came kind of bent + doesn’t really return to shape, so it was uncomfortable to wear. But it gets the job done!"
3.0,"I sent it back, it was much to small to serve my purpose. However it seemed to be made well, and was attractive."
3.0,It is okay. The clasp is not as good as the Fossil band. It will open unexpectedly. The band is so long that it's in the way trying to close the clasp. It looks pretty.
3.0,"I wanted to get my dad a sweet keepsake gift to give him at my Wedding. I found this ring and figured it was cheap enough to take the gamble on. After I placed my order I realized the shipping would be after my wedding however the ring came 25 days earlier then expected. It fits how it's supposed to however it's very hard to see the letters on the front and on the inside of the ring. I almost didn't see the inside text, I had to shine a flash light on it to see. The letters are printed on not engraved. It's a nice buy just not what I expected"
3.0,"These masks are no different from the others. I thought that this valve helps to breathe, but there is no such thing as the rest of the fabric masks."
3.0,"It's nothing fancy. Just a basic zip hoodie, and not very warm. And it shrinks! It was a tiny bit snug at first, but in a way that I could tolerate. After the first wash it became too tight for regular use, and has now become my emergency back-up hoodie for when I'm behind on wash. I like my sweatshirts baggie though, so think of this as a true to size slim fit."
3.0,Shrunk up way to short.  But otherwise very cute
3.0,"What a pity. Such a cool design but sized for tiny people only. For reference, I'm around 5' 10&#34; and wear an 8-10 in jeans. This &#34;coat&#34; fit snug all over, almost like a corset, and barely covers my rear, so I couldn't even wear it with leggings. The model is obviously 5-feet-nothing tall and probably weighs 90 pounds soaking wet.<br /><br />Hey guys, if you want to sell clothes in the U.S., please size them for us long, tall American gals, and hire some American models too (most of our fashion models are 5'10&#34;+). A 5-foot-2, 100-pound woman is in no way &#34;average&#34; for the U.S. She would be considered &#34;petite&#34; at best and would probably have to shop in the Girls Department.<br /><br />Regretfully returning...."
3.0,Creamy White color on the inside unfortunately 😔.
3.0,Very thin material and see through. I only wear these with shorts over them or a knee length dress.
3.0,"A size too small and went to my ankles (I'm 5'4 with long legs), returned it"
3.0,Smaller than expected and the clasp isn't great but it looks like the picture.
3.0,Good lenses. Very heavy.
3.0,"I loved everything about this dress, but the two saggy patch pocket tacked on the front of it totally ruined the style.  Sadly I had to return it."
3.0,Very comfy! Great for lounging!
3.0,This dress was awkward to say the least. It was hard to get off the shoulders and loose everywhere else so it did not stay put. keep in mind this dress is also short so when the shoulders pop up your bottom pops out. I’m 5’5 130
3.0,"My wrist is small but this is tight on my wrist, I can’t wear my watch for hours because it becomes uncomfortable. The print is really cute though."
3.0,"My daughter is 2 months old, 12 lb 6 oz. The onesie and headband fit well but the pants were huge and could not be worn."
3.0,The purse was smaller than I expected and the color is similar to the picture.
3.0,This one sealed the deal; I'm not buying off brand clothing any more.  The material is cheap and almost see-through.
3.0,Nice but a bit smaller then expected
3.0,great for costumes or young girls. but besides that i would not recommend them. the backings are cheap silicone and they don't like to stay on. the jewels are stuck on with a glob of sloppy hot glue and are not centered. I now keep them in my purse as back up earrings. but you do get your moneys worth.
3.0,The chars are very small. 50% normal size the other was useless.
3.0,Very scratchy and stiff
3.0,Really like color & graphics. Too tight. Must run small.
3.0,"I like this watch well enough, except that the band is very stiff and hard to adjust. Also, the band color is more reddish than I expected based on the pictures. I'll probably keep it and see if the band gets more flexible over time."
3.0,Much wider looking than in the photo. Looks pretty bulky on.
3.0,Cheaply made started to fall apart after a few uses
3.0,They were smaller than I had hoped but they were nice looking earrings. Had no problems other than that.
3.0,"I agree with another poster saying this feels like potato sack fabric. My son cried when he tried it on. I’m not sure washing it would make much of an improvement. I’m returning it for something softer. Otherwise, it looks nice. A bit see through for the white color. I would have had my kid wear a white T-shirt underneath but the arms bugged him too much even for that."
3.0,"It doesn't fit everybody, probably for children."
3.0,"I loved the previous ones I got, but this has no stretch at all and is too tight."
3.0,They were s little smaller than I thought but I like them alot
3.0,"While the overall quality is good,  the &#34;one size&#34;  is misleading.  I have a size 7 1/4 hat size, and this hat was tiny.  Even on the largest size adjustment.  I'd say if  your hat size were 6 7/8 or below, it should be fine."
3.0,I liked everything about it except I thought it would be thicker than it is it’s very thin material not see-through but not that warm thick material that you think would be great for winter time.
3.0,"It went great with my Cleopatra costume on Halloween, however the chain around my finger broke off towards the end of the night. Other than that it was a great accessory for an Egyptian costume."
3.0,Only 1miss understood
3.0,"Very large and I have a large head.  I ended up cutting off the flower, flipping up the rim and sewing it in place and reattaching the flower.  Once I did those things the fit was perfect but otherwise the cap entirely covered my eyes.  I don't like the &#34;slouchy&#34; look at all."
3.0,My lense popped out in less then a week
3.0,"Material and printing are good, but not USA standard sizing. Order a size up."
3.0,They were okay not what I expected will not buy again.
3.0,"They came as shown the picture. A little miss leading because of the picture, i also must not have read the title/words carefully. I wanted real earrings not cosplay. But for being cosplay they i guess i would recommend them. But make sure you want cosplay and not real, or vis versa."
3.0,Exactly as described. Very pretty. Arrived before expected delivery date. Very happy with my purchase!<br /><br />P.S. Beware that they do have nickel in them.  Unfortunately I did not know these. No point in returning all the way to China.
3.0,"I thought these were the ones I ordered before. The ones I got before were more like tshirt materal, these are stiffer and scratchy. I washed them didn't help and they don't fit the same as the other 5 pair I got I like<br />sorry"
3.0,"Loved the design, if you are of the flatter tummy variety it will probably fit quite nicely."
3.0,"Comfy and fluffy, but they sent me the wrong color (I ended up with the pink camo instead of the plum), and it is too much of a hassle to return something during a pandemic, so I am stuck with this color that I don't like that much.  Probably not worth $75.  If ever they are on sale for $40 and you can get the color you want, they would be a worthwhile purchase."
3.0,"I really like these shoes.  They are perfect for an everyday outfit, but the run way too big.  My daughter is small and I ordered 12-18 months (which she is now 13 months), but the shoes still don't fit her.  Good thing she'll grow into them and they can be winter/spring shoes, so we'll use them anyways."
3.0,"Ordered a 10, (that's a size bigger than normally wear) was very narrow. Not for wide feet."
3.0,"I ordered my size and had to return it. I got the next size up, and it was ok but still tight. If you look under the dress I am hanging out...<br />I like the dress/skirt part and how it lays. It covers the bum and front, and starts below the bust which I like."
3.0,Not as big as it shows
3.0,Es muy grande para el bolsillo
3.0,The engraving on the gauges isn’t very noticeable like the picture shows. I still like them! They’re cute.
3.0,"Got sent the wrong color. Ordered purple but received white. Overall, quality is good."
3.0,"Good quality, passed it as an expensive gift for a girlfriends birthday. Worked perfectly with that hipster ecclectic style.<br /><br />boom"
3.0,"Although I love the color, length, and curve-appeal for my pear shaped body, it is just way too big under the arms and around the bust area. I had to adjust those areas big time. I am a size B on a good day, so I guess that area may just be intended for someone more ""endowed"" than I am. Not an end for me, but a warning to others shaped like me."
3.0,Like the print but not a soft t shirt knit. Don't care for the slippery feel fabric.
3.0,great looking watch. I am extremely upset with the very cheeeeeeap ass band no excuse for it
3.0,"It's cute and arrived super fast, but the nob to set the time broke after like 3 days of being on my key chain (with few keys and keychains) so my time is either wrong or not set. it is a cute piece though."
3.0,The bonnet stays on however the material is very thin and lightweight. If you have product on your hair it will bleed through the material onto your bedding. That is a no no with white!
3.0,"I bought this for a gift but returned it. The seller is easy to work with. The little ""diamonds"" really don't look like stones at all, just bumps on the silver bar. It's a nice idea. The one with 5 circles by same seller is much nicer. I have gifted that one before as well."
3.0,"About 4 years back, I ordered a  [[ASIN:B06XVF19C8 similar set of coiled keychains]] which I absolutely loved - after 4 years, the one I use to clip my small wallet to my belt look is working as well as the day I bought it - better than the wallet, actually! I'd been concerned over the fact that the end of the coil was simply fused to the body of the coil, but that has not been an issue.<br /><br />When I wanted to get more of them, I was disappointed that they were no longer available, but found this alternative product. The fact that the end of the coil is fastened with metal also appealed to me (though as noted, the fused ones have not been an issue).<br /><br />Sadly that's the only potential improvement.  These key holders are far flimsier than their predecessors: far stretchier coil, with much less bounce-back, and the metal ring part is thinner. Adequate, but definitely not as strong as the earlier set.<br /><br />The photo with the purple (old set) and orange (new) shown parallel does not make the flimsiness obvious, though you can see the orange coil looks like it might be a little thinner.<br /><br />The photo of the two holding my earpod cases really demonstrates how flimsy the newer one is - I had trouble holding the phone far enough back to capture the two, since the newer one let the case dangle so much further down than the older one.<br /><br />I would be very hesitant to trust these with anything requiring daily pulling-out and putting-back - such as how I use the older ones with my wallet. I wanted them to make it easier to carry my wireless earbud case in my pocket, with a little more security, and they'd be OK at that as long as I'm not constantly fishing them out and tugging on the coil. I suspect that after a bit of that, the coil would wind up permanently stretched out.  They'd also do for attaching something to the keyring loop inside my purse, which is how I'm most likely to use them."
3.0,wrinkles really bad after washing.
3.0,"Nice quality, not tight enough."
3.0,I usually wear a med. I can get this on but tighter than I would like
3.0,"this is not flattering at all, the fabric is a t-shirt sheer fabric with lycra wish sticks to your body all over, very heavy but most of all sheer, need a camisole or a slip"
3.0,"Nice,but I got all the same size chains. Would of liked the 3 different sizes that I thought  I was getting."
3.0,"They were MUCH Smaller than I thought, I like them tho'... They are a Snug fit but very comfortable and simple. Very glad I stumbled on them here!"
3.0,waist and knees are sloppy. Frill has no structure. Shorter than expected.
3.0,"Bought these for an upcoming Renaissance Faire. Needed something that fit with the outfit but wasn't costly and these fit the bill. I ordered a half size larger than my shoe size (typically do with boots) and these fit just about right. I can't see wearing these for hours on end of dancing or walking, but for the afternoon events, they should work just fine."
3.0,"This was cute for my daughter, but came very small."
3.0,Love it but it only came with one and was too small for my nipple.
3.0,I love the paws but the flowers have lost all the little black stones. I still wear them but was a little a diassapointed
3.0,"Material is very thin, and they are way too long, I would have to wear 8-inch heels for them not to drag the ground.  I am 5 ft 2 inches tall, which is a little short, but you would need to be nearly 6 ft tall to wear these pants, which is very tall for most women.  I wish I would have realized they were that long before I ordered them, and I wish they offered petite (short) sizes."
3.0,"This is a really cute shirt for kids. It is like a thick t-shirt. It isn't quite a sweatshirt. Really, the only complaint I have is that the neck ribbing gets a little wonky after a few washes. It looses it's shape a little bit. So, it looks a little more messy on a daily basis than it really should. My son loves the shirt and it usually barely hits his drawer before he is back in it."
3.0,"Very cute dress. I really wanted it to work ,but am returning bc it is about 2 sizes too small"
3.0,Good shirt but not the right size for 2x
3.0,"Returned, it was to small. Cute but size down"
3.0,"Comfy, but the little pads slide all around everywhere, and cause the bra to look pretty lumpy. Pads also seem to be quite small, only covering a tiny portion of each breast, so they're kind of pointless past an A or B cup size."
3.0,"Not the highest quality & shorter, boxier than the photo but for the price, ok enough."
3.0,"It is a nice quality the reason I gave it a 3 star was that the tail you have to tie to your waist and the tail is heavy feeling it doesn't stay in place, it flops back and forth. It felt like I just tied a plush toy to my waist, it was akward feeling. The ears didn't stay in place either I had to keep readjusting them. They are hrld to your hair w bobby pins, not very comfortable."
3.0,Cute but way small
3.0,Fit is weird and while the stripes look black they’re actually navy..... I was ok with that but the material in the picture appears cotton like but it’s like a cheap polyester blend that lints easily. It’s snug at the waist also
3.0,Great jacket. Except...he had it about 10 days and the zipper broke.
3.0,"It was labeled as XL, but on arrival the tag revealed Asian XL/ American medium.  It was more along the lines of a small.  Return was very easy and processed quickly."
3.0,I got the xxl which is suppose to be a 13.  It fits fine if I don't wear any socks but otherwise its tight.  Normally I would wear a 12 or 13 depending on the sizing.
3.0,Me agrado el diseño<br />Pero no son buenos para una persona que camina mucho en el trabajo o está de pie mucho tiempo  la suela no es acolchada y duele la planta de los pies
3.0,"Cute dress but this didn't work for me - I'm 5'2 and measure bust waist hip at 34-27-34 and weigh 117 with 16.8% body fat and wear 34C or between size 2 and 4, the sweetheart cut for the boob coverage may sit too high, and the length may be too long for your taste -- at least this was the case for me. I tried both small sizes and neither fit well. The x small made the cap sleeves more narrow and the breast coverage was too high. The length remained long. The standard small size 4 did better on coverage but seemed like too much fabric on coverage to be flattering and was long."
3.0,"Pretty  but very  long. I'm  5'4"" and it is at least  6"" too long"
3.0,"Looks just like the picture. I wear a 3/5 in jeans, ordered a small and it would even go over my thigh. I would need a large maybe even XL to fit properly."
3.0,Not scratched and color was awesome BUT the left silicone  piece was missing the screw that holds it and fell right when I took it out of the package. They are oversized and that's the main reason  reason why I'm returning them
3.0,"It was hard to return this dress. I loved the velvet material and the color, the top of the dress was flattering and classy. The issue was the front was too short. I thought maybe I could let it slide if I stayed standing, but no matter how I sat down, legs crossed or flat, my underwear showed.<br />I ordered a large, I’m 5’6 and 163 lbs."
3.0,"Nice materials and construction but more for a casual, cargo pants than a tactical situation. Not gusseted in groin area for freedom of movement, no reinforcement in knees or seat, not large enough for an athletic build.  I had to buy a waist one size larger so that the legs werent too tight. Still couldnt do a lunge in them without splitting the crotch out. If you have muscular legs get a couple sizes larger and wear a belt. The draw string in the cuff will keep them from dragging on the ground and is great for cinching at the top of your boots so you don't have to keep them tucked and bloused.<br />If you have skinny legs these will work just fine for the advertised waist size.  The waist is accurately measured."
3.0,This jacket is very warm which I like. But the zipper is really low quality. Very difficult to zip up the jacket. Overall it’s just ok....
3.0,"Personally, I didn't find the yellow tint to be particularly helpful with night driving"
3.0,I wanted to like these based on the nice reviews and cute pictures but the proportions were off for me.  They fit my daughter fine so I would definitely say these are particular to a body shape I don’t seem to have.  I ordered based on waist size and they were a bit snug in the waist but loose in the hips.  I am not tall (5’5”) and felt they were a bit short as well but would be cute worn as a cropped length.
3.0,Chain is flimsy and clasp is way too small! Hard to get on and off by yourself
3.0,Glasses make viewing hazy/cloudy.  Not clear.
3.0,"Well, they are a mixture of likes and dislikes. First of all, the colors are darker than what was pictured when I chose to purchase them. I was happy with only one pair. One of them had a flaw in the lens which I indicated in the pictures. The Bow or (proper name) temples are kind of short. Those are my dislikes.<br />My likes are, the price for 5 pairs with matching case and they are not bulky.<br />So, knowing this information, I would not buy them again. Learned my lesson."
3.0,"These are a surprisingly soft and comfortable pair of shorts that I expected to use for workouts/running. However, it's not really possible since the drawstrings have frayed to the point that I just threw them out from frustration.<br /><br />Unfortunate but I would recommend the seller to find alternate drawstrings or sell a version that isn't made for athleisure."
3.0,"The fit was good. But it gave me the option to order a black one so I did and suprise, it showed up green. But still a nice outfit."
3.0,Sizing is way off. Bought a 3-6 month... fits like a 0-3 and after one wash it’s almost like a newborn size.
3.0,Xtremen stripe boxer Brief 60% Polyester and 32 % cotton not very breathable in hot climates as i live in FL it's hot here. Recommend one size up i normally wear a M size waist but went with a size LG and it fit perfect i have 32 inch waist. They don't ride up at all in front so very comfortable for this reason. In the crack they do ride up a little because of seam. legs come up about mid thigh on leg length. What i didn't like was where they put the seams in the butt crack valley and then wyed off down the back of the legs you feel these seams the most when sitting down. They need to rethink the seams 3 stars out of 5.
3.0,Comfortable but i wouldn't recommend anyone with ANY extra tummy buy this. It fits in all the wrong places.<br />This would be a great late maternity summer dress and then it would look cute with how its made.
3.0,No es el tamaño q esperaba pero al menos esta bonito
3.0,"Looks poorly made and a little bit fake, yet the code for lokai.com/mycause did work. It also took 10 days to arrive."
3.0,"Really cute shirt, but runs very small. Fast shipping."
3.0,"Looks nice, comfortable to wear, good color. The only strange thing is  there is no official Versace tags or papers, came in the plastic bag with Versace name on it, that it. The original Versace items have certificates, paper, box, etc. as a proof that it's real. Also the place that ship the item wrote on the products Q&A that they sale only original products.So it makes me think - where are original tags then?!"
3.0,Hat came actually quick considering. Dale face cut off in stitching tho
3.0,A bit un- flattering
3.0,"I had high hopes for this because it's so cute and inexpensive but even though I sized up it was really tiny. If you're getting this, size up by maybe 2 or 3 sizes! It was smallest in the chest and waist. Sleeves were actually ok."
3.0,They aren't that durable I needed a more heavy duty type of garment they are good for women with a short torso also women who don't have too many love handles
3.0,To heavy so it hurts my nose bridge. But other than that is looks grest
3.0,"This is one size – NOT one size fits all – but it does not! It is probably a size 3 or 4 – flat across the waist band it measures about 12 inches. And I about 39 inches long. The material is probably a rayon type – there are not any labels indicating material, washing – drying instructions or where this was made. Unless you are tiny this will not fit as the waist band does not have a lot of extra give in the elastic band. Besides being really small – it is very cute and would make a wonderful beach wear cover up – but you will need to wear a small size. And I would guess hand wash and air dry. The green did not come out very well in the pictures but it is kind of an ocean green – very pretty. I was able to receive this skirt at a discounted price or free for a fair, unbiased and honest review."
3.0,"despite being careful when i washed, it shrunk quite a bit  i am dissapointed"
3.0,Cute but smaller than expected. :(
3.0,Pretty but to small
3.0,This outfit is cute. The sizing runs big. The head hole is very roomy. Material was thin.
3.0,"Very cute shoes! I really like the way they look but they are not comfortable to stand or walk in. I ordered my usual size 8 first, but they pinched my toes and I exchanged for an 8 1/2. Unfortunately this didn't fix the problem; now they're a bit too big in the length but still tight in the toes (I don't even have long toes or wide feet so this is odd to me). Cute shoes but I wouldn't recommend them."
3.0,"There are pros and cons to this watch. I bought this watch several months ago and I seriously fell in love with the look! What other reviewers say about the curve of the watch is true, however, some people like it and some people don't. Personally, I like it a lot. The real con is that, like some other reviewers who have given this product a lower rating, the glass is quite weak. One day I noticed a huge, deep scratch on the glass, which is strange because I'm very careful with this watch and I only wear it when I have conferences or meetings. I had to take it to a watch repair man because this seller claimed that my warranty doesn't pertain to scratches, and they offered no other options for me to either fix or replace this watch. The repairs, due to the unique curved shape of the glass, costs about $50-65 at my local watch repair place. I still like the look of my watch, but it's a shame that just repairing a defect that isn't my fault costed nearly 2/3 of the cost of this watch. This watch is beautiful, but it's delicate."
3.0,My only downfall is that the bill arrived bent. I have been working the hat to get it back in shape but it still remains crooked/pointed.<br /><br />Other than that the hat is good quality and shouldd be fine when fishing.
3.0,"One of the two plugs had the copper concave shell fall out prior to arrival. I glued it in, but I am confident this means I will have the other three fall out (and probably lost) eventually. For the price, maybe you just have to risk it."
3.0,The earrings are cute but they changed color very quickly (faded into some strange grayish color) and I think they are not 100% silver/gold because I got nickel allergy and I reacted on the earrings very badly.
3.0,So the product is shown with a large variety in size along with even mix of sizes. However when it arrived I had a small amount of 6mm and all the rest was the smallest size. I’m in the process of returning them now
3.0,"It's rather cheaply made.  I have gotten better fake jewelry at this price, so I was not impressed."
3.0,"I bought one and I returned it. This watch is not a military watch except for its color. I am a veteran and I would never wear this watch if I was in service. We have dedicated real compass, altimeters, barometers, etc, etc and even though this watch offers all of that, it would never replace our dedicated equipment that are way better in all respect.<br />For climbers, hikers, etc, probably yes but that is debatable too. The watch has a good looking and that is all. You cannot read it from every angle because the cristal has a lot of reflection. The luminescence is the worst I've ever seen. I do not understand why Casio is way behind in that department. Seiko and Citizen watches are super glow and stay glowing for the whole night but this watch, is a joke in compare to Seiko and Citizen watches. So, what exactly you have is just a Casio with a lot of whistles and a great looking camo military color. That is all.<br />Also, and this is very important, the battery will last only 2 years and there is no way that I am keeping a watch that is not Kinetic or Solar. We are in the 21st century and batteries are obsolete in my opinion or any watch requiring that, should be considered obsolete.<br />My Citizen is EcoDrive and needs no battery, it does glow super nice and the price I paid was less than $300. My Seiko is Kinetic and I need no battery as well and its glowing performance is superb, sapphire cristal and built like a mule. I paid less than $500, so when I compare this Casio watch with what I have, I was paying just for the color and the great looking of the watch and I do believe that $460 is too much. This watch price should be $200 because whatever is coming with, is not really useful in real life, not even I believe for civilians and much less for military people."
3.0,This was SUPER LONG on me and pretty darn big for a small lol. Like seriously. Nice material & the hood zips all the way up so that's cool. Definitely runs WAY big!
3.0,Easily wrinkles and can see they it
3.0,Size up pants are small
3.0,Very stiff.
3.0,Good shoes if you're in a pinch or need an extra pair to send to grandma's. Not so great for everyday wear. Within a month and a half the velcro began to tear away from the shoe at the stitching.
3.0,"I  have a bit of a stomach, so I was looking for a good looking shirt I could where untucked.  This makes one look slimmer.<br />The picture online didn't look like it had shirt tails.  Also, I  measured my chest and waist from the online measurement chart and it looked  like large was the  size to get. Turned out even though we measured, it's still too snug around the waist.  So, I'm going to have to send it back.  If it were straight across the bottom, I would send it back and re-order an extra-large. But with those shirt tails, I doubt it."
3.0,Very cute but the posts are very short.<br />I’m returninf bc of it.
3.0,"I bought these to be festive while<br />I work - I shop for people and deliver groceries, so I thought the holiday feel would be cute, more than half of them were awkward and scary looking (lol) and they’re so thin they don’t have barely any protection from the elements"
3.0,"comfortable band, crystal shatters very easily. Not suitable for everyday use, if you don't want to break it."
3.0,Bought this dress and it didn’t come with the corset strings. A little bummed. Fits as expected and material is “ok”.
3.0,"Ordered this to wear with lounge wear and as a pajama tank. The fabric feels super soft. Not to thick as too be hot. Not to thin as to feel flimsy.<br /><br />The stitching is nice. Overall, the quality was good.<br /><br />But, the strap were way too short. This made the shirt dig into my arms to the point of being quite uncomfortable. It was also unflattering because it made the tank quite high on my chest...as tanks go.<br /><br />I am sad to return it."
3.0,"They were really cute and dressed up my comfy black pumps.  Within an hour, I looked down and one was gone. 😞"
3.0,"I got these and some cheaper ones.  These are definitely of higher quality.  However, I'd rather have cheaper throwaways since they all get snags when working in the yard (unless one needs the better compression these provided).  This review is based on my personal price/benefit ratio.  I would recommend these over the cheap ones if compression and a dressier was a priority."
3.0,It isn't true to size.
3.0,"These are cute, but look cuter in the picture.  L"
3.0,I had bought bamboo underwear about 5 years ago from another company and they were finally wearing out. The price had raised on the old brand and I had some issues with the last order I had done with them so decided to try these out.<br />Perfect fit. Bamboo is the coolest and most comfortable material I have ever worn against my privates. Plus... it is a renewable resource.<br /><br />*Update... after two washings the fly pouch on two pair is coming apart. (I hang my bamboo clothing to save it as long as possible) I had to drop my rating to a three for shoddy workmanship. Otherwise they are great shorts.
3.0,"A little stiff, not comfortable for a long day"
3.0,This review is for Baby Boy Girls Knit Romper Jumpsuit Pure Organic Cotton Long Sleeve Bodysuit Blue. This is a really cute infant romper. It is 100% cotton and is soft. It is knitted so it is thicker and warmer than your typical romper. The description says that it is machine washable but the tag on the romper says hand wash. I personally don't like to buy baby clothes that are hand wash since some days you can change a baby multiple times a day and who has time for making sure the clothes can go in the washer or have to be hand washed. Hand washing for baby clothes is impractical. Also the buttons are a little hard to open since it is knitted. I think snaps would have been a better option on this one.
3.0,"Fairly low end material used for construction, will not last long once washed a few times, other then that it is a fairly decent novelty item that is disposable... for the cost you cannot beat it.."
3.0,"Great size, washed up easily. Carry bag string arrived frayed and almost broken which was a disappointment and only reason for 3 stars."
3.0,Great fit very comfortable however the buttons must be smaller than their opening because my shirt is constantly becoming unbuttoned to the point I have to wear a tank top underneath because the buttons have come undone. They randomly unbutton- either the chest area or abdomen area depending on the day. I work outdoors but I don't feel walking around should cause my shirt to spontaneously open :0(
3.0,"This is nicely made, all French seams (although one near my collarbone is overlapped and rubs my skin).  The buttons are secure.  It is very shiny, and it feels a bit static-y, but should soon relax like silk.  Also, I am not crazy about the stiff interfacing in the lapel."
3.0,Really thin practically see through and ends are not stitched.
3.0,Thought they were for children but actually.adult size.
3.0,"I was just disappointed with them. They don't look very good on the face either, but I can't be too mad about it with the price."
3.0,It is  little big.  Maybe v when be each it.  It will shrink a little b bit
3.0,"I was excited to find a pair of maternity pants that weren’t jeans or leggings. Unfortunately, the fit on these wasn’t quite right for me. The “waistband” for the quick dry material sits quite low. At 6’0”, the length on the pants is also a little off for me—not quite full length, but not cropped either. All in all, these are a nice option to have in my closet, but I’m not sure how much practical use they’ll get."
3.0,"I am usually a small in most Queenie Ke leggings, but these fit pretty tight and I didn’t really like how it looked on me and how uncomfortable I felt. I also didn’t like the heel holes because its hard to get your foot in and it’s hard to pull the whole thing up your leg. It’s just not simple as normal leggings. I also didn’t like that the waist is not high waisted eventhough i am only 5’2”. I really like high waisted leggings because of the tummy control, but this doesn’t do it for me.<br /><br />I do like the mesh part though. It really looks nice, but I wish the leggings themselves were more comfy and soft regardless of the mesh."
3.0,look ok  fro that price
3.0,When it came in half the heart was silver it looked dirty my mom liked it but still kinda sucks and it was also pretty hard to adjust
3.0,I order for color. Longer than I wanted but works
3.0,"It does block the blue light, however looking through them almost feels like looking through a hazy film.  They eventually give me a headache after wearing them a while."
3.0,"I'm 5'5"", 145 lbs, 36D, and usually wear an 8/10. I ordered this in size Large because a lot of dresses are tight on top. I do suggest sizing up if you are between sizes. Was super thrilled to order and receive this. It’s super soft and not too thin, perfect for fall to winter. Very comfortable and they made the top with “room for the girls.” Even though it's mostly dark black, it's still a fun style and print. I really wanted to love this dress because it has crew neck and pockets, but the tiered skirt hit me all wrong.  It made the skirt look like it was pulled too high up on my body.  Plus, it made the shiny fabric stand out oddly.  I do wish it was a little longer, too.  It hits well above the knee on me, so I can't wear it without tights and boots. Otherwise, it looks cute just as it is, or paired with a denim jacket.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!"
3.0,I really like these skirts however it ended up being too big for my liking. Since I dont want to waste my money I am trying to get through wearing them through the summer and can hopefully pass them on to someone else. I may buy another set just smaller. Go smaller ladies
3.0,"Colors are very pretty. The red is more of a purple pink color. I am normally a size 16/18 & 36DD. I purchased the XL based off previous reviews. The dress fit but not in the bust. It was very tight and the top looked very awkward because of the fit. I think this would be a very sweet, cute dress but just not for me."
3.0,One of the shirts came with a stain on it.  I hope they're durible becasue i ended up with 2 for the price of 3
3.0,I am a 38 DDD and this bra was very comfortable but it is just too flimsy in the shoulder straps! It wasn’t enough support for a chesty gal such as myself. So the gym or yoga is definetly out! Which is what I purchased for.  But it’s a nice comfortable option for lounging around the house or road trips!
3.0,Wow these were way too tight. If I pull them up really High I can just barely button them but then I get serious camel toe. Lol<br />I will be returning them.<br />That being said they would be super cute if they fit.!
3.0,material low quality
3.0,Good bracelet for a kid. Perhaps using a lighter thread could make the bracelet appear more classy.
3.0,"I liked how this bra fits and it's not uncomfortable initially but after a few hours, I can't wait to take it off.  It's just heavy.  I really like how it looks."
3.0,Pretty much don't stay up....there is no otter seam so it tends to fall down?all the time.
3.0,"1) The watch looks great and fit comfortably after sizing it but the glass on the inside broke after only having it for a few months.<br />I took the watch off and set it down and let go of the strap and the clasp section falling the 1-2 inches to the back of the watch broke the glass on the back of the watch clear through ( i can actually reach in and touch the gears).<br /><br />This review is probably a caution in how to handle the watch... I plan on getting it fixed but there probably doesn't need to be glass on the back in the first place as it's just against your wrist all the time. So before buying just be aware.<br /><br />2) The gears that keep the watch moving are very sensitive, it's suppose to translate your movement through out the day into keeping the watch ticking but I often found that the watch would stop while I work at my desk during the day."
3.0,At first the ruched part seemed flattering but with a closer look I noticed it bunched in the center in a rather inconvenient place. The ruched seam was also stiff and irritating. The waist fit comfortably without digging in or pinching. They are not compressive; I would say they would be best for casual wear. I am 5’5 130lbs and the small fit well.
3.0,"Yissang Women's Pull-on Office Business Casual Ankle Dress Pants Trousers with Pockets - Size XL, Color Black<br />I'm 5'6"" tall, 125/130 lbs. I normally wear a size small or medium or 6 or 8 pants. I received an XL when I ordered these slacks. 95% Polyester, 5% Spandex. Hand Wash Only - Inside Out.<br /><br />Even though the slacks are too large for me, there are many things I can talk about. The material is polyester and very shiny. The pants have a 29"" inseam. They look pretty long on me, but that's mainly because they are too big. There are nice deep pockets on the front that give the pants style. It also looks like there are two pockets on the back of the pants, but they are not real pockets; just there for the design. The pants have an elastic waist - in the front it doesn't look bad, but in the back it makes your rear look saggy. There are belt loops on the pants that just don't seem to fit the style of the pants. The pants kind of look like fancy dress slacks that missed the mark. I am going to give them a three stars since I am not sure if I would like them more if they were my size. I really tried hard to make them look okay! And that's what they are, okay. Hope you found this review helpful."
3.0,"These sunglasses are very cheaply made. This is our third pair, (you would think I’d learn!), and although they haven’t broken yet, I anticipate it will happen soon. Easy to bend, very fragile, and when my daughter looks down, they slide right off."
3.0,It's not the thing that I expected
3.0,"Got the item that does not look exactly as on the picture, the back side is plane no design at all. Also material feels cheap. I can only wear this around the house or when I mow the lawn :-)"
3.0,"I got this and it was missing two buttons. The fabric is kind of low quality and the dress is definitely see threw. Other than that, I like the dress and it was pretty true to fit!"
3.0,"The product is as described, it was just too big"
3.0,smaller then I thought
3.0,"I’m 5’5 and weigh 125-130 depending on the day. I normally wear a small or a 2-4. I ordered this suit in a large because everyone else advised to size way up. (Not enough people put their height and weight and the size they bought in reviews and that makes them pretty useless. Do better. Thanks.)I bought this bathing suit strictly for the top, and thankfully that fit well. The bottoms were really awkward fitting and loose. They somehow fit but are too baggy...yet still show too much skin. But the top is really cute! I’ve had two kids so my boobs aren’t what they used to be but this top holds them up well and creates the appearance of cleavage where it no longer exists. 32dd in bras btw and the large top fits great. The total cost of the suit is much cheaper than any similar styles of this top so it’s still worth it even if you won’t be able to wear the bottoms. So! 3 stars because the top is cute but the bottoms are awful."
3.0,I was somewhat disappointed in the looks of these Earrings. They really don’t look very much like I spent anything for them and I’m not sure I’m going to actually give them as a Christmas gift
3.0,This mouse pad isn't as smooth as I thought. The Eagle makes it hard to move the mouse around. It's rough.
3.0,Cute and comfortable. Except the small isn't really small. It's more of a medium. The dress definitely isn't as pictured. It doesn't have a zipper either. It does stretch though!
3.0,"You have to be careful when you buy things from China.  They tend to run small.  I ordered a large, but should have gotten an extra large."
3.0,"thought i was getting xl but the size must run small, would not the around my waistline, but it's beautiful ill give it to my daughter."
3.0,the material is a little thicker then I expected and a little snug on my upper part but over all I like it!
3.0,I wanted to like this dress so badly!! I found the wrap to be way too awkward to navigate and the arms were quite tight. I had to send it back. The fabric was beautiful though!
3.0,Not exactly what I expected .
3.0,"Usually WOOSEA dresses are great, but I'm not thrilled with this one. It fits a little too tight. I'd order a size up, if I had to order again. At 5'7&#34;, 39-27.5-39, size 8, I bought a M, which usually fits. This one is wear-able but a little too snug. The colors are great."
3.0,"So the shirt fit ok, but the collar is very large. Almost like a v neck and I was looking for something tighter against the collar. The colors were also a little off from the picture, but that didn't really matter. Just didn't look as good up close as it did in the picture. Still a great choice if you like the design."
3.0,it's pretty but does not glow
3.0,The material is too large up top. Doesn't fit nicely around the waiste. Strap are not adjustable.  Materials texture is nice!
3.0,"I wear a 2x but ordered a 3x for a looser fit. The 3x is the size of a 1x - 2x. The material is thin, but I do like the blue color."
3.0,Loved at first.  Skin broke out in rash so I washed in cold water and delicate cycle in dryerjyst enough to take out some water.  It shrank about 3 inches in length so now it's a top instead of a dress.  Had ordered another style and will probably send back.
3.0,"This dress is very cute but.. when I tried on, size 12  it wouldn't  fit my bust a 14 would have been too large for waist and hips.  I was disappointed in the heavy material and lining.  For customers in cooler climates 90 degrees and under this dress would be great addition for spring and summer."
3.0,"nice short/undies...but, for same price, i could get 6 or 8 pairs of other decent undies ,too.  if they werent so expensive, i would prolly buy more..but $100 for 3 pair of undies, i go back to going commando!"
3.0,"Super cute, good quality.  Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. Just too heavy.  I unfortunately opted to return them."
3.0,I usually take a size small so had read the reviews that it runs small so ordered a medium. It is still a little too small. Should have ordered a large. Basic t-shirt material.
3.0,One of the pearls has already fallen off. Ugh!
3.0,The material is comfortable the fabric beautiful the design amazing. The only problem that I found with it and to me it is rather disappointing is that this came to me with a kink in the zipper. This makes the dress extremely difficult if not next to impossible to zip up.
3.0,Would be a great product but WAY too small
3.0,I thought hat would be more of a dri-fit material by the description given.  It's your standard bucket hat made of 100 cotton.  Over priced as well.  The same hat type is $20.00 cheaper on Amazon after looking.
3.0,"Nice sneakers. True to size as far as 6.5. NARROW was the issue. Had to return. Child really wanted this, was so disappointed not a wider cut. After a shopping day at mall, learned that all Air Jordan's are narrow cut, and don't come in a wider width. Seller was easy to work with and not the issue."
3.0,"I was hoping that the antifog goggles would be good for wearing to a Gwar concert, but not so much really... Decent swim goggles tho."
3.0,"The necklaces are cute, but fit my kindergartener far better than they fit me. I even measured my neck again before ordering to be super certain - don't know that I would've ordered a 5 pack if I was unable to use all of them. At least my child is stylish now."
3.0,The quality is great and the vest is cute but it's too short! All day I kept pulling it down. I didn't return it because it was for Halloween
3.0,Pretty bathing suit but runs small in the stomach area. Will be returning because of that.
3.0,"The top part of the dress is longer to the waistline than the last one I bought. Not too happy with these, loved the last one"
3.0,very nice dress but the size was too small I ordered a medium but it fit like small
3.0,Low Quality material. Looks nice though.
3.0,I'm 5'6. It seemed like it was made for someone with a longer torso. I returned it.
3.0,"Wife really liked them but they ran too small and didn't come in bigger size, returning for refund."
3.0,"Too small, size up"
3.0,very cheap made
3.0,"These are very crotchy shorts- they have a lot of room there , looking like they were intended for men LOL - I am 130 lbs 5’4 and an athletic build I have a 26 inch waist and ordered the small - they fit in the waist but are quite large in the thigh area and crotch. I have a large butt and thighs so imagine my surprise on how large they are in that area. Guess it depends on what you’re looking for!"
3.0,"Cheap material, thought it would be made from higher quality material. Wrinkles easily. Hangs on body like a wet rag."
3.0,"Well made, but a little to rubber like for me. The style is perfect."
3.0,"Too large and long sleeve not short sleeve. Will be useful eventually, but not for another year or so."
3.0,It does look a little cheaper than what I thought it would.
3.0,"This fit bigger than I expected. I am 5’1” and it’s isn't too long, hits right above the knee. Although it’s a little loose, I still like it and will keep it. It is a light material that isn’t see through. I like the cut and pattern and it will be perfect for summer!"
3.0,Lindo pero la mañita seronpe facil mente con solo medirselo pero muy lindo
3.0,"Es muy hermoso pero no parece original, le faltan detalles que los originales si tienen. Ademas vino con una parte de la correa hundida y sin el manual de instrucciones de Fossil"
3.0,Ordered size 14 granddaughters normal sizing and the shirt was too small. Quality ok.
3.0,Was pretty solid for the price point and was also good for my first wig cosplay. But I would recommend spending a bit more and getting a nicer one. Ended up getting really frizzy towards the end of the day. It also didn't want to stay braided the way I wanted.
3.0,"This was a gift for my best friend who had a baby 4 months ago! The quality of the material is a little low, and the writing on it was kind of fading also, but I still gifted it. My best friend loved it, since her and her husband are such Bob Marley fans! But when she put it on the baby it stretched a little bit and the writing on it looked worse, almost like it wasn’t brand new and the letters were starting to fade off from over washing it."
3.0,"I will say like the feel of these leggings— everything else is kind of meh for me. The material is very light. In the black, you can’t really see the contour at all. Not a lot of tummy control. VERY see through with the slightest movement or bend. They feel more like casual leggings than workout leggings for me"
3.0,Thin and cheaply made. We were disappointed.
3.0,Pretty but ran smaller than i expected around the middle.  I even went up a size.
3.0,I got a small and it fits like a medium it's big on me
3.0,looked better on line.
3.0,Cute but either I was sent wrong size or they run large because the 2t fit my 4 year old not my 2 year old.
3.0,They are very well made. I just bought a medium  and it was a little snug for a three-year-old. There was one in the package that seemed to be bigger than the others and that 1 worked. Maybe I missed something in the size details
3.0,This was way too short. I ended up giving it to my mom. I’m 5 ‘8 and the pants fit like capris.
3.0,I dislike that the chain has turned already
3.0,"Did not care for the material. It is the type of poly that does not breathe, I sweat in some poly's and so did not wear it. The size and cut were nice though."
3.0,The dress was not what I expected. The XL look like an extra small.
3.0,I was very excited to get these shoes and then I wore them twice and they already started to fall apart. I am very sad as they were so comfortable. The sole of the heel is already lifting from the wedge part. I do not know how to fix them. I am very disappointed as now I have to find a new pair of shoes that I hope wont fall apart after wearing them twice. :(
3.0,This keychain hook is built for a 1&#34; belt.  The quality appeared to be pretty good for the price you pay. The faux leather is pretty thick and looks like it will hold up.
3.0,End up being to fragile.
3.0,"I followed the size chart and it was WAY too big. I ended up giving it away. Whatever you think you should get, get it."
3.0,"These gold loops did not work for me. The posts are way too big to fit in my ear. If you take a close look, you can see that the posts are wide and flat. I ordered the silver ones a while back. They were not as wide. I am able to wear them in the lower holes. I gave 3 stars because I received a refund and was told to keep the earrings. Not sure what to do with them but it was a nice gesture."
3.0,"I like the cardigan but it does not<br />Match the color that it is online, it is actually pink I’m real life and the the purplish color that is shown in the picture."
3.0,Super cute but didn't fit my ears. Too big :(
3.0,"They run to small my daughter couldn’t fit them. Bad lacing on the shoe in certain spots, but my daughter loved them to bad she couldn’t fit them"
3.0,"Smaller then the picture, unless this lady has really small lobes.... these earring are like a dime size.  So if you want a small dime size earring, these would be the one.  Otherwise the quality of the earring is not bad.  But be careful when unclipping them.. the rod can bend..Like I said small..."
3.0,Fell apart pretty quickly after getting it.
3.0,"Short dress, kinda small"
3.0,Mine came broken. The anchor wasnt attached on one side. :( Otherwise looks like it could be nice.
3.0,Its cute. Comes with a lot of different designs.  My kids like them.
3.0,"Great shirt, good quality,  but the sizes run small. I'm a big guy and a XXL usually fits the way I like: flowy with lots of room. This XXL fits way too snug. Kinda disappointed.  If you buy, size UP."
3.0,"Very nice gloves, fit well, but the touch screen pad works intermittently at best.  NOT very warm on cold weather."
3.0,"These are see through, the python is a cut out. But the material feels thick and sturdy. They are great but you have to wear something over your butt."
3.0,"They were nice and soft, you got good face covering, and the print was pretty but the extra material for the filter pocket was problem. It sat right against my mouth and made it difficult to talk and to be understood, resulting in pull off and away from my face."
3.0,had two different sizes. ordered medium
3.0,Was definitely smaller than should have been
3.0,I feel the cheap quality of the glasses
3.0,"Really liked the dress and pattern, but the dress has no shape. I felt frumpy in it. I sent it back."
3.0,"I have a brown version of this and adore this cap. I decided to order the grey version so I could wear it with more clothes. While it does, it also has a purple hue to it. So certain clothes I could use a true grey cap with, I can't use it. So beware on the colors of this product, you may end up with a color you were not expecting. Fit wise though it is perfect. It is also really cute and the style goes with a lot."
3.0,Was really hoping this product would work well. I put my plain white converse sneakers as directed into the warm water with a scoop of the product. Had a soaked it in soapy water. It would’ve had the same result. It didn’t clean the sneakers very well.
3.0,"These seem okay as far at the fabric goes, but we find they slip off the heel way too easily."
3.0,"This earring is pretty hard to put in and the bar is pretty thick. Depends on what you like, but earring didn't work out for me."
3.0,"They are not as snow proof as I wanted. Kids feet got so wet, soaked. Don’t get these if kids are playing in snow!!!!"
3.0,These belts are fine if you order at least 2 sizes up. Coming from China they run extremely small.
3.0,Got these in my usual size 3/4 and they slipped right through my ears. Easily an 8th off
3.0,"Arrived today, color is an exact match very roomy. It does look a bit cheap though."
3.0,"I normally wear a 4/small, but got a medium after reading reviews and it fit perfectly. The dress actually has a size zipper along the torso, but I was able to slip on over my head without using it. Unfortunately, I am returning because I don't like the print. I was hoping it wouldn't be so &#34;cartoonish&#34; in person, but it looks like weird wallpaper from an eighties Chinese restaurant."
3.0,"I ordered a small and it's still too big.  The picture of the model looks thin and her coat seems to fit perfect.  I'm 5.7 and weigh 120 lbs.  My waist is 26 inches and this is just too big to overlap double breasted and wear the belt.  I even tried to wash and dry hoping to shrink.  It endured the wash and dry nicely and did NOT shrink.  That's a good thing.  I ordered the purple.  I love the style so much, I'll pay to have it altered to fit me."
3.0,"Cute dress.  Quality as expected.  Full circle skirt.  Unfortunately, runs quite small.  I am 5’2” and 107 pounds.  I ordered a size small.  I could just barely zip it up.  Too uncomfortably tight to wear.  Since 100% cotton no stretch and would likely shrink."
3.0,"Am 5'4&#34;, 130#. Should've purchased small instead of medium. Thick & cozy; good with tank underneath on cool days. Receive compliments a lot to which I always share, &#34;Got it on Amazon!&#34;"
3.0,Kind of uncomfortable for me and didn't hug me well. Did keep things contained during my workouts.
3.0,This is a great looking watch...my only concern (not complaint) is how much lighter in weight it is than my husband's other luminox. It makes me question its authenticity.
3.0,Cute but you get what you pay for. My favorite one (the reason I bought the bundle) Broke after one use
3.0,So i really do like the dress its just a really thin spandexy material so if you wear aNything under it you can see lines.  I also ordered a size up since i was a little nervous with some of the other reviews and honestly i could have gone up ANOTHER size! Its not too tight it would just be more flattering since its soooooo clingy. And would look more like the picture. The slit does fall in a very awkward place since the bottom is completely wrapped  but a lalrger size would help and maybe putting a stitch in the hem at the thigh to keep it from rising while you walk which is what im doing otherwise it is very hard to keep personal areas covered. Also the top of the dress isnt a deep v like in the picture  its for much more coverage than that so it works well for larger chests.
3.0,Not the fit for me
3.0,Runs small<br />Comfortable
3.0,"I bought these for my 3 year old and they were a little big as I expected, but my real issue is that they stretch out a lot! He wears them for an hour and they are stretched out around the leg holes thus riding up his butt. The material is very soft so I imagine it's comfortable, I just wish it didn't stretch out so fast."
3.0,Size inaccurate
3.0,It's a pretty necklace but it's a lot smaller than shown!
3.0,"fabric very comfortable and does not add bulk.  Only problem is the heel (back) does not stay up.  The fabric is so sheer, so not really a problem and is am wearing comfortably."
3.0,The chain broke once I opened it. It could easily be fixed though.
3.0,"Too small , the picture shows more big"
3.0,I bought it for a beach vacation and I followed the sizing guidelines but it still was too tight & fits smaller than expected.
3.0,The monkey ears and tail were just what I expected them to be.  We used them for a halloween costume and it worked just they way I hoped it would.
3.0,"I was a bit disappointed that the cravat was almost too short to go around my neck, tie and hang a reasonable amount into my vest without popping out. It may be that I am just wearing it wrong. The fabric is beautiful and it goes nicely with my Victorian clothes."
3.0,The tab is a bit wide and the belt had a big glue spot.
3.0,The purple is a funky color and no bluish green. But since its for a Halloween costume and the price isnt bad and the shirt can be fixed with some fabric paint.
3.0,"Thick, but thumb should be covered."
3.0,"The tabs on a few have pulled loose so I can't hook them on my caribiner. Takes longer to fold these. I find I don't want to. Purchased them because the local grocery store, whose bags were so cool and folded quickly, stopped selling them. This was the first alternative I could find."
3.0,They are much darker than expected. I still think they are nice though and well made.
3.0,"The two side pouches suck, they're velcro not snaps btw. They make so much noise while hiking. For the price it's worth it only to come out with a decent pack and waist pouch"
3.0,Light weight and a neutral color. I doubt I would buy it again.
3.0,"Comfortable and nice looking, however blocks very little noise. I wear them at work and can hear all coworkers very clearly."
3.0,"Well made, but lens to dark and transition to magnifier not crisp."
3.0,"The pendant itself was wonderful though a bit heavy.  The chain broke after only 2 wearings.  With the weight of the pendant and how it moves along the chain, a thicker chain is necessary."
3.0,"Not much to say about this, they fit a bit big, and tear easy."
3.0,They are super awesome but the arm holes are definitely made for skinny girls. My arms loose circulation after a couple minutes because the elbow straps are too tight.
3.0,Not really impressed. I have other cleaning cloths that work a lot better than these. They are just soft cloths.
3.0,This bag looks exactly like the picture on Amazon. It's cute and petite but didn't wow me. Would be great for a hipster looking for something vintage-y without the thrift store smell. Might even be good as a man purse...murse....man bag...you know what I mean.<br />I imagine it would age beautifully. I was getting it for a trip to Europe and the closure didn't feel secure enough for me. Just a magnetic snap. No zipper inside.<br />I've never had my pocket picked but I've had a few friends who have and now I'm vigilant about making sure my bag closes. Even at home in L.A.<br />I sent it back but it wasn't because it wasn't cute.
3.0,I like the look of the sweatshirt until it started to pill and on a cold day the material is OK but as soon as it gets a little warmer the polyester starts to feel very uncomfortable.
3.0,"poor quality, thin fabric"
3.0,Cute bras! Just order a size larger as they are not true to cup size.
3.0,"These gloves were not as advertised. First the touchscreen feature did not work, second my hands were freezing after 10min. On the positive side, they are pretty and would be nice driving gloves, if you’re looking for warmth, look somewhere else."
3.0,Bought this for xmas. Looked cheap so my daughter didn’t wear it.
3.0,I wear it but not crazy about it.
3.0,The dress is pretty but runs small
3.0,I can not wait summer to wear my body chain.
3.0,Difficult to keep straps in the device.
3.0,Wanted to like it. But I ate the mask when I would talk to anyone .
3.0,the green toe are of these compression socks are bigger and wider than the rest of the sock. even after drying them in the dryer the toe area is still big.
3.0,So it truly is beautiful as described! Easy to put on the watch! Problem is it does not stay right at all. I’m trying to figure a way to keep it at least semi tight. Why? Because I absolutely love the band!!!
3.0,Super cute but a bit heavy. I do not recommend wearing this while running or doing physical activities
3.0,"Too small for a 4t dress material doesn't stretch, my daughter is one yr and a half."
3.0,The elastic broke within a week.  I had to resting the beads on another elastic string. Saved the keychain but disappointed it did not last.
3.0,"The bridge is welded crooked, but I like them. They're cute and very lightweight. The glare is not bad but do not recommend taking photos with a flash."
3.0,"There is an underwire in this suit, and it was too big for my boobs, which I am a 40 C. . Otherwise, I had gotten many compliments on the style of the suit. Shorts were too short for my liking."
3.0,Hat quality is good. Only issue is the Yamaha print is too small
3.0,"My preschooler likes these shoes, but I did not factor in that the eyeballs are slippery. She has slipped and the googly eyes do not help at all and make the impact worse. I will not purchase slippers like these again."
3.0,The fit was great! Was a little disappointed in the color. ALOT brighter orange than expected. Still happy with it.
3.0,The waist and length of this dress was perfect. However I'm a 34 DD chest and it was still too roomy in the chest. I'm going to really need to use a lot of double sided tape to keep everything covered and in place. Would still reccomend the dress though
3.0,The alarm stopped working.
3.0,The necklace itself is not bad quality but the inside where the dandelion seeds are supposed to be there was only one and it wasn't very visible.
3.0,Dress ripped along the seam.
3.0,The molds are inconsistent for the teeth.  Still had fun with them.
3.0,"Last summer I bought 2 pair, 1 black and 1 blue, to coordinate with my bathing suits; I wear a size 8. Even though I live within 3 miles of the beaches, I don't go as often as I did because of the increasing number of tourists each year. I wear the black pair with my beach suits (not that often; 3 - 5 times each season) and as slippers year round. The blue pair I've mainly worn while working outside in the yard. I'm a recent widow with 2.5 acres to maintain so I'm out in the yard 4 - 6 times per week all season. I am disabled too, so I can only handle between 2 - 3 hrs each day. About 3 years ago I cut my leg when I went to the dump for my first time; I quickly developed cellulitis and spent nearly 7 months with outpatient wound care. Since then, I have had a problem with my feet and legs swelling, especially when it's hot out. I really thought the blue pair was tight because of the problem with swelling; not at all! After I've worked in the yard, I generally hose myself and my shoes off then lay the blue flip flops on the bench outside the garage (which gets the afternoon SHADE) to dry before going in to shower. When I started wearing the black pair as slippers inside the house (after my shower on the same days I've worked in the yard), I thought it was odd that they fit different than the blue pair! It wasn't until I put both pair next to each other that I realized the problem wasn't swelling at all; the blue pair actually SHRUNK! I couldn't believe it; why would a company make flip flops out of a material that would shrink if it was exposed to the sun?? I mean, really; who doesn't wear flip flops in the sun? It seems absolutely ridiculous and it's absolutely frustrating, particularly since I love them so much. I attached pics to help you understand the degree of shrinkage; the blue pair is in the center (with the left black flip flop in the left and the right black flip flop on the right). If you look closely, you can see that the blue pair is not only shorter, but they're also not as wide or as tall; even the heel shrunk!  It's not like they're inexpensive either. I definetly prefer this style now (as opposed to my toes between the prongs of the original style flip flops), because my feet don't slide forward when they get wet and the arch and cushioning is comfortable too. So, needless to say, I would have to recommend these flip flops because I ordered a replacement blue pair, but this time in a size 9! My advice to anyone intending to wear these outside in the sun an average of 6 to 18 hrs weekly, would be to consider getting the next size up (if you don't want to have to replace them within a year)!"
3.0,"went according to size chart and got the Large which is large on the top. Going to exchange for medium. Other than size, cute dress and will be good for summer."
3.0,The clasp broke within 3 weeks.
3.0,These are cute but really really heavy causing some discomfort
3.0,"Love these but I wore them to the beach and got them wet, now they have water stains on the lens"
3.0,Fabric has a shiny polyester finish so you could easily dress an outfit up with this blouse but was expecting the spots to have a fuschia color but more of a salmon color. So it won't go with my accessories.😔When you roll up sleeve doesn't have same as outside pattern which would have been nice which shows in pic. Not a bad shirt but wasn't what I was expecting.
3.0,Thin fabric but really bright red! Maybe I will wear it in the spring or before Christmas. Nice style.s
3.0,It got broken in 2 days...
3.0,Generally like the glasses for the price but the lens has a small bubble in the coating.  Not worth the hassle of returning but a bit disappointing.
3.0,"These are nice quality masks, but in no way are they for kids. It fits my face perfectly. It almost covers my 8 year olds eyes."
3.0,"I took a chance to see if it was in a factory package of 3. No chance.<br />If you only want to purchase 1 T-shirt for $15.99, be my guest."
3.0,They are ok for the price
3.0,Kind of long
3.0,I get so many compliments on my watch. The only thing that is inconvenient is I cannot see the hands when in the daylight outside.  Strange!
3.0,"This is a beautiful dress and so well-made, I was really disappointed that it was too tight thru the chest.  I will be returning it for that reason only."
3.0,Will not stay up over nose.
3.0,Not sodalite And it was for my daughter’s birthday
3.0,Like the style but not well made
3.0,It fits to loose on me expected for it to be a little fitted
3.0,Order a size up to achieve the look in the picture.
3.0,Fits ok except it is too small on my chest. Im a 36 D. I will still wear it but wish it fit better.
3.0,Have yet to wear or try on. Bought when it was on sale
3.0,"Beautiful dress, light In weight, perfect summer dress, very short but fits way too small. Not true to size at all."
3.0,Shipping costs cost more than the product and also it doesn't stay in place
3.0,"So, here's an honest review.  These glasses are high quality, come in top-notch packaging, and look great.  But, if you're looking for glasses that reduce the glare of oncoming headlights or brighten the roadway for night driving, these glasses simply don't do the job.  Frankly, I think they are simply yellow-tinted plastic lenses applied to a decent frame.  While I'm disappointed with them, I'm giving them an overall rating of 3 stars, which reflects a 5 for quality and appeal, and a zero for anti-glare and night driving properties."
3.0,"Bet you can't guess how wide my feet are?  You point to my feet and exclaim, &#34;THAT wide!&#34;  I reply, &#34;WRONG!!  They're wider than THAT!!!&#34; 😕<br /><br />These are cute but run sofa king narrow, I'm pretty sure I now know what Asian women feel like when they have to bind their feet!  I think a half, or whole size up, would have fit much better.  Not worth any more than the $25 I spent on them, thus 3⭐."
3.0,"The style, size, price and quality are good. However the line where the magnified part of the lens starts is pretty noticeable. Also they don't get nearly as dark as the picture shows. After being in bright sun for 30 minutes they are barely shaded at all."
3.0,"Seems like a good shirt, but returned it because I found others I liked better."
3.0,"The hearing above shows I purchased the tiny heart, but in reality I purchased the the tiny circle.<br />I recently won a ring and earrings with the paved tiny circle pattern.  They are paved with cubic zirconias.<br />I purchased this necklace to complete the set.<br />When I received the necklace, it was as described, but had fewer cat's that really did not sparkle that much at all.<br />The overall manufacture of the piece is good."
3.0,"This is a really pretty skirt. I like the print and the fabric. I’m 5’5 168 lbs. I usually wear a large so that’s what I ordered since it says it fits true to size. The length was good.  However, the elastic waist is pretty tight. Not sure if I’m going to keep it or not. I think an X-LARGE might just be too big."
3.0,"This bra fits true to size with comfortable rib cage adjustment. Shoulder straps adjustments are easy to use, non-bulky and don't itch. The best and worst feature of this bra are the side panels. While the fabric allows for heat release, there is no support."
3.0,"TO walk around the house no rugs, do they have a larger size."
3.0,"The ring is very pretty but, the diamond like wedding ring turned very cheap looking. The band itself did not turn. The other ring still looks good."
3.0,I didn't care for the band. Hard to tighten on your own and chain kept getting caught on stuff. Went back to old band after 3 days.
3.0,"This skirt is very comfy. Like pajamas!<br />I do wish the waist was a little more structured though, whenever I put anything in the pockets, it pulls the whole skirt down on one side."
3.0,Could have been done neater but for the price it was OK
3.0,"Nice, but wish they made them narrower."
3.0,XXL is smaller than I thought it should be.
3.0,"Such a beautiful dress and so unique BUT the bottom is super wrinkly when you get it and if you try to iron it, proceed with caution!!! I burned mine with the iron."
3.0,I was very excited when I ordered these but more than a few didn't work when we received them and the kids and even the adults had a difficult time light them while on the finger tips.  There is a rubber band on each unit to keep them on the fingers but it was a bit awkward and the kids had a hard time with it.  We ended up using them in between 2 fingers and clicking them off and on.  Not sure if there is an easier way to use these because no instructions were included but overall the kids enjoyed them and even with the ones that didn't work we had enough for all the kids..
3.0,"These glasses look just like the photo, but... the frames are HUGE. I dont have a small head but man I had to bring the pliers out to these beauties to make them fit comfortably. I also added hot glue to the ends around the ears because they were kind of sharp. Regardless, they weren't bad for the price."
3.0,some pieces were broken
3.0,"This was a lovely material, felt great sleeping in it.  However, even after washing, the dye (red in my case) wore off onto my sheets as I slept.  Didn't notice right away, took a couple of days, but yeah, def pinkish me shaped mark on the sheets.  I unfortunately had to throw them away as I couldn't trust the dye wouldn't do this to another sheet set."
3.0,"As a Floridian & someone who only wears black this scarf was not my fave. I tried it on and immediately got lent all over my outfit... and it’s the size of a throw blanket which is great for the cold but it doesn’t get cold enough here to wrap blankets around my neck. Still very cute though, extremely soft. Not all negatives, just not for me."
3.0,Screw fell out and was lost soon after purchase
3.0,"Nothing fancy but for the price, not a bad deal. They just twist easily so don't lay flat."
3.0,Band looks and feels great. Fits husbands apply watch 4 perfectly. Unfortunately after wearing for 1 day the side button fell off. Not too bad for $20.<br /><br />Side note - he is a salesman he he doesn’t get too hands on with things.
3.0,Too big but cute style!
3.0,"The short life of inexpensive jewelry is a tale as old as well, Inexpensive jewelry. In this ring's particular tale, It appears that after extended use, the coating on the ring rubs away, revealing the cheaper metals that turn a finger green. And although a green thumb can be a compliment in the garden, a green ringer finger is a blemish at a garden party."
3.0,"They white and black dress was a little disappointing, the white was dull"
3.0,"It was cute, but made kind of cheap. It worked for what I needed."
3.0,"The frames are pretty much indestructible and they are comfortable to wear; however, the lenses are very hard to get and keep clean and the lenses are not polarized.  Some of the other frames you can get polarized lenses with but not the ones I bought.  For the price you get a good pair of glasses but there is a reason other manufacturers charge more, despite what REKS' advertising says.  If you want a good pair of glasses for cheap then these will meet your needs."
3.0,Quite flimsy but I guess this is what you get for the price; would not buy again.
3.0,The faux leather end of the belt was too wide to fit through any belt loops.  I had to trim it down with a scissor.
3.0,"So I got a new pair of sunglasses and needed a new strap to keep them on my head. These look great! When they arrived, I put them on my sunglasses and the ends that go over your ears are just too thick and uncomfortable. I’m sure they would be great for flotation, but my glasses spend more time around my head and neck and that’s where I’d like them to be comfortable."
3.0,Its nice but not as wide as it looks in the picture
3.0,Fits small. Order a size up for more comfort
3.0,"The shirt on the pics looks like a regular cotton t-shirt but upon arrival it is a silky sports like material. I don't really care for it, but the quality of the shirt seems good. My son will probably like it."
3.0,"I really liked the appearance of these, and the fact that the side arms were normal thickness, not so wide like most of them are.  Makes it easier to see what's to the side of you when driving.  On the other hand, these sunglasses were just gigantic and made me look like a child wearing her mothers glasses for dress-up.  I was very sad to have to return them because of this. They just looked ridiculous on me . Really wish these type of glasses came in different sizes rather than one size in each style. They were really attractive which is hard to find but just didn't work for me. Bummer."
3.0,Screw keeps coming out
3.0,It is large
3.0,"Love the color and flow of the fabric.  Read the details about sizing. I don't know in what universe a XL is a size 6! Fortunately it has some give, but fits tightly!"
3.0,"cute, but the whole for your head is SOOOO tiny. It's like you're wearing an actual choker, but since the material is stiff, it isn't comfortable."
3.0,"The dress is really cute, but the top is very small across the bust and sleeves. Length is great. Afraid a larger size will be too long.  Went by the measurements on the page."
3.0,These are definitely no show on a size 11 foot.
3.0,Not enough brim for me
3.0,"product is ok, but I realized I really didn't need it at all."
3.0,I wasn't wild about it when it arrived so I gave it to a friend's daughter and she loved it.
3.0,I love these bands but one of them was missing the piece that connects to the watch. Was really disappointed that I can't use that band.
3.0,I am small in diameter so the neckline was too low for me. Could be fine for someone a bit broader. Medium weight fabric nice length of midi dress.
3.0,I bought this shirt in red and loved it so I ordered it in blue and green.  The blue and green were a different material and smaller than the red. Love the red but not the other two.
3.0,I ordered the size I normally would and they don’t stay up very well. They are not ankle length on me either.
3.0,"Cute top, but the proportions are off. It runs very small/narrow, and the length is too long. So if you are tall and skinny, order up and it will fit."
3.0,"It already looks cloudy, very disappointed!"
3.0,"I mistakenly thought this was going to be the best purchase of the pandemic. The company's description was misleading as it wasn't as comfortable or breathable as described. The fabric wasn't terrible, but also not more comfortable than cotton. Both the pink and black masks fit far under my chin, yet my eyes were simultaneously covered. I tried to trim the material to fit, but it frayed across the top which made the ear strap unraveled."
3.0,Seems a little pricey for keychains. But granddaughter wanted these for the characters and she is happy.
3.0,This product is comfy but you do have to tie on the corset part yourself. I think it is thinning and only got a three out of five because it takes forever to put together and it’s on the shear side so you’ve got to work a tube top underneath.
3.0,[[VIDEOID:b7488adc739b95565b887643ad59f65c]] I ordered an xtra large because of size chart dimensions. The XL is more like a XXL The length and size of the sleeves are awkward and very large. I should have ordered a large but even that would be questionable. The top does not fit like the advertised picture. The front is shorter and very wide around.  I am 5’ 6” 163 lbs with a 38 C chest. My husband thought it was a sleep shirt so I guess that’s what It will be.
3.0,It we wy too big for me
3.0,Over priced.
3.0,"A good light dress for Summer!<br />However, I sadly cannot wear it because even washing in cold water, the red bled around the flowers and in some other spots on the dress which was very odd and disappointing....."
3.0,"I bought a Small and it fits. I'm 5'6"", 135 lbs. The color isn't exactly as expected. I wanted the more teal color in the picture. I have a necklace that would have been perfect for it. But the color is more baby blue, doesn't go with my necklace. It doesn't hang on me like on the model, I like how it hangs on the model. I don't like how my shirt hangs. Maybe it will loosen up? When I ordered it I had thought I would love this blouse, but I don't."
3.0,little tight
3.0,"I only gave it 3 stars because I did not receive the item shown. I am going to keep what I was sent because I haven't seen a bag like this before and I like it, but I'm going to order this again and hopefully receive the right item."
3.0,got these for the kids. they are average quality but they were for the kids more as a fashion thing than proper sunglasses. Kids dig em and at that price I can get a few pair so when if they break or scratch too badly I can easily replace them.
3.0,The pants look better online they did not fit they were too small
3.0,I like this shirt and I wear it but there is no way of getting around seeng my bra from under neath my arm pit. The arm holes are just so large. I wish they offered petite sizes.
3.0,I bought this for my 12 year old son. The jacket is thin and made of very cheap material. Feels like it will tear easily.
3.0,"Not thick at all but I knew they weren't going to be, sadly the bows both fell off the first time I wore them i just glued them back on. Definitely not bad but the bows could definitely be reinforced better."
3.0,"I've had quite a few pairs of these grippy socks - they're great for yoga, pilates, or any other type of exercise where you need stability. They're also great just to wear on slippery floors, especially for the elderly. I'd say these are fine. They're not the best, and not the worst. Just fine. They are noticeably thinner than some others - I can see my toes through them (I'll spare you the photo lol). They also slipped a bit. But the colors are pretty and they did great in the washer."
3.0,The back of the screw is almost too long to wear these comfortably. I give them 3 stars just for being unique.
3.0,I got this gift for my husband since hes hard to shop for. He says he likes it but he also said he thinks its for a girl.
3.0,came in handy for a halloween costume
3.0,"Super cute, comfy...definitely runs on the smaller side."
3.0,"Sadly I had to return this. I am 5'2'', 125 lbs. a 32DD and ordered a medium. The area around the shoulders were a little too tight and the v-neck cut is quite a bit deeper than I had expected. The chest area was surprisingly a little loose so I would have had to wear a cami underneath."
3.0,"but they are cute, couldn't use them too long because they turned my fingers green, but honestly worth the money"
3.0,"Looks like a solid pair of pants but they were too big and it is not stretchy skinny pants. If you want good khakis, these pants will work.  But they were not as described"
3.0,The stones are falling out
3.0,A lot smaller than I expected.  Its a nice bag.
3.0,"Beautiful and oh so comfy fabric... However, it looked like my grandmother's nightgown on me so I'm returning it. :(<br />Also, the elastic around the waist hit a little high on me, so if it's pulled down to where it should hit, the neckline is way too low."
3.0,Not what I was expecting. The cute little pleats at the top are really high and above the breast line so it looks more like a maternity top. The construction and sewing are of very cheap quality.<br />I was excitedly waiting for this top to arrive and unfortunately I was very disappointed with the quality.
3.0,Very pretty dress! Dress came too small so it would not zip. Order a size larger! The bust is for someone well endowed!!! Not my tween!
3.0,Too snug and had yet to be washed.
3.0,"I like the pants. However, they run big."
3.0,I am giving it 3 stars because it is pretty. I got this as a Christmas gift but was very dissatisfied with the size. It was a 3X but it looked more like a medium. It runs way way way too small. I hate to have to send it back but it would not even fit my small size teenage granddaughter.
3.0,pretty earrings but found very hard to put on
3.0,These shoes were great for about a couple weeks then the lights stopped working and wouldn't cut off then wouldn't come on. I had to return them that was a smooth process though.
3.0,"Very nice product for the price, but arrived with two pieces broken. Easy fix with some jewelry pliers though."
3.0,Good quality but unflattering for anyone with a little tummy. Hugs you in all the wrong places. I love this brand and was excited but had to return
3.0,"WAY TO SMALL. CUPS ARE ABOUT A C. I AM A 36dd..DO NOT FIT AT ALL, HOWEVER, THIS SUIT IS MADE REALY REALY GOOD AND SOMEONE WITH A SMALLER BUT LINE WILL LOOK SPECTACULAR IN THIS..."
3.0,Very frail not for more then a few uses
3.0,The idea of heating jacket is good. But this one simply not that warm. It doesn't come with a battery. So getting a battery to fit the pocket is little challenging.
3.0,"Thin fabric, pleated seams coming apart after first wash. Not suitable to wear without a slip, or leggings, it's just not thick enough. This dress is also meant for ladies with a long torso. If you are petite, short torso, Apple shaped, this is not for you. Better suited for someone pear shaped, taller than 5'3"" .  The only thing I liked was the color, it is a pretty shade of green. I didn't return it. I'll donate it."
3.0,Came very wrinkled<br />Is very thin cotton. Just ok. Zipper is decent.
3.0,"Just as other reviews have stated, the lenses on these are pretty flimsy and bendable. They are also very reflective, so I found them a little hard to see out of (I'm constantly seeing my earrings in the back side of the lens. The fit and look are great. I just wish they were a little sturdier."
3.0,Looks super cool<br />Quality is not the best
3.0,"Length of product was perfect for me for my labret, but the head to me is a bit small. You almost cannot see it.And it seems as though it could almost pull through the piercing. It shouldn't  be advertised for use for labret. Also while the material is a lot mor comfortable than metal, the edges are really sharp,  and were soon starting to irritate my lip. A slight  redesign and the product would be spot on."
3.0,"This was a decent looking set, although obviously fake leather. But the size was way too small and I returned them."
3.0,"Cute dress. I ordered a Large, because others mention that the color would change when it stretch to white, and I didn't want that. I'm 5'7 160. The dress was ok, but didn't look as good on me as the model."
3.0,These earrings are lightweight and look nice but when I put them on I didn't like the way they looked.
3.0,"They're ok.  I've noticed after wearing them for a little while, my ears start to ache.  For some reason they seem to irritate them.  They're fine to wear for a few hours if I go some where, just uncomfortable to wear all day."
3.0,"Overall is was a nice tank top however it was too short in the front and there wasn’t any adjustable straps. The quality of the material is nice. If it would’ve been a bit longer and if I could adjust the straps, I would’ve kept it."
3.0,Not what I expected. I returned mine but it could be cute on someone else and the material was really soft and did not feel cheap.
3.0,The colour was good as was the elastic bands. The sole was a bit thin but appropriate for the price. This is not for women who have foot issues. No support.
3.0,This is about as low of a price you will get for a pair if padded bike shirts.  The padding could be a lot better but they work fine for me for a 20-30 mile ride.
3.0,"I was hopeful after reading the size chart and reviews, but the XXL was more like a medium on me. |VERY tight. It's cute, and I will keep it to wear at night. For reference, I'm 5'9 and 190 lbs."
3.0,"This top fit like a crop top.  The size ordered was large but can only be worn with a high waist skit.  After the second wear, the button closure at the neck popped and the shirt gapped open, not a good look or fit."
3.0,"I am 5'3"" weigh 145 lbs. I ordered a med orange colored. The waist & hips are a little big but would be ok. The chest & shoulders were more like an XL 44"" chest rather than a medium build with a 38"" chest. The sleeve & shoulders were big & went to my elbows. I give this a 3 for the color & material which I do like but i will be returning this."
3.0,Strange waistline.
3.0,My preschooler won't wear them though they &#34;fit&#34; because the elastic cuts into her feet. :( They are so cute!
3.0,"I love the design of the cover up, but it's smaller than expected and I would've preferred it to be a little less sheer."
3.0,Shoes are super cute and fit well but the cross in the back pinches your ankle when you walk. Other than that these wedges are super cute.
3.0,Good for what they are for. More of a pre teen size. A little big for kids a little small on bigger adult fingers.
3.0,I really liked them all they are just to large for me. I am returning them probably getting something a tad smaller.
3.0,The colors are nice and bright. Size was as expected. Fit great. I don’t  like how thin the material is. When it’s on can see through it.
3.0,Wore these 1 time and they smell horrible!! It's in the dye and the fabric. I'm going to try to buy a spray because they're super cute but still...dont take them off at a friend's house that's for sure!! Made my pants that were tucked inside also smell!
3.0,"These leg warmers are not thick at all to keep your legs warm, not fitted enough to stay up, slowly slides down a little and thats with them on top of leggings,  but they are ok to wear."
3.0,"This top is very pretty to look at - however, it does not fit. The sleeves are way too short, the bodice of the top is huge and the length of the blouse is too short. It isn't long enough to tuck in but its too short to cover the waist band of the pants that is if you move very much. I am about 5'6&#34; and weigh around 120 with a fairly large bust; even at that, this blouse just doesn't fit anywhere. Maybe if you are more petite, with shorter arms, shorter bodice and a little larger in the body frame. Returning"
3.0,These really cling to your body.  If you like that it's probably good. If your like me with a few curves and a tumy then its not flattering.  Good undershirt.
3.0,The material is thin. Looks nice and well made while wearing it.
3.0,"Just want to mention there is no front or back to these.  So if you bend over the back of the legs completely ride up to the bottom of your bum.  There is no extra fabric to cover your but,t you just stretch them into position but they don't stay there.  The pictures are a bit deceptive in that they are shown to go down on the legs a few inches but they will probably ride up higher.  However, the fabric is really nice."
3.0,Not what I hoped for. Gumball machine rings
3.0,Absolutely beautiful and the fit is perfect but the stitching on the shoulder strap came undone the first time washed. Only got to wear it once as I haven’t taken the time to sew it back up since I was so upset.
3.0,"Really awesome and funky looking hoody. It keeps you cool in the very cold. I wear it for bike touring in the winter. Just this and a short or long sleeve icebreaker baselayer and I'm good in start stop all day.<br />In the evening one definitely needs a big puffy and at least a shell over this because it is so breathable.<br />What I like is that when I start out I am not cold and then have to warm up. Very nice piece, but sort of a one trick pony."
3.0,Top part fits true to size. Bottom part has a fairly puffy area on the belly part causing my mommy pouch to look even larger. Not a fan of the material but none the less it’s a cute outfit
3.0,Decent suspenders that will accompany any outfit to add a more sophisticated look. The quality of the fabric is strong and the option to alter the size of the suspenders makes it highly adjustable to the height of any individual. The bow tie serves as a good companion to the suspenders. Let's see if they withstand the test of time.
3.0,Liked the glasses but didn’t last a month until lens where coming off
3.0,leather strap ok but it's long too much so u have to be careful
3.0,I sized up since people said it was small. Went with an xl since im a large and this said junior size. Super cute but it's thin and it kinda faded after first wash.
3.0,"These boots look great but they aren't the most comfortable to wear. I was hoping they would be more comfortable after breaking them in for a couple days, but that doesn't seem to be the case. They pinch at the toe a little bit. It's tolerable for short periods of time but I wouldn't enjoy wearing them all day. They are decent quality for the price and look really nice, they definitely match with a lot of things and I appreciate that the soles aren't flat and slippery like so many other boots. I just wish they were a little more comfortable."
3.0,"I bought two of these & each one lost a stone the same day.  I still wear it sometimes since it's not that noticeable. It's a descent ring, you get what you pay for. The silver has not tarnished at all on these & I've had them for over 2 months now."
3.0,"I call tell this helps with my sports goggles fogging issue to some degree, but I still have to wipe away moisture from the lenses periodically."
3.0,Very nice looking band. Came with the wrong pins to attach to my 42mm watch but lucki6i had spares from a previous brand. The band seems like good quality but the latch worries me a bit that it might come undone on it's own as there is no safety latch but will update aftersome time wearing the band. The link removal with the included tool works very well and not hard to remove links
3.0,Definitely flares out more than I would of wanted but very cute.
3.0,"The design of this is weird, the &#34;coverup&#34; is questionable... It is also very small. Im a size 2-4 and it fits perfect, maybe even on the smaller side. Im using this for some maternity pics so I don't plan on wearing it to the beach as a cover up. I might try it one day but it's not something that will conceal anything it's more of a decoration, similar to a necklace, throw this on to look snazzy."
3.0,"Pretty, but it was broken when it arrived. So cheaply made, so worth the cost...but you get what you pay for. Not worth the hassle of returning it."
3.0,I liked them but they were to big on my legs so I had to return them. I may try the next size smaller when they are on sake again.
3.0,"These were a gift. The recipient liked them and said they were comfy, but the footbed flattened pretty quickly and the quality wasn't great. They looked worn very quickly and are not in good shape after two months of use."
3.0,"Really soft and comfy, but they were a little big so I returned them. Also, the fabric seemed like it would stick to a yoga mat or barre floor which is where I'd primarily be wearing them."
3.0,"It’s cheap plastic looking material & smaller than I thought.  I also can’t compact it without forcing it closed with the help of using the floor.<br />I choose the one with clouds underneath, now that I liked."
3.0,"I was really excited to receive this shirt (so much, I bought it in three colors.) The ""One Size"" thing just doesn't work. The tie at the waist is great for fitting many body types, however the button on the top to secure the top really doesn't work and gave the ever so lovely ""pancakeboob"" effect. Typically a medium top fits fine, but at  5""10""/155/34D, this top does not work for me. The fabric overall was nice and light, albeit a bit sheer to forego a bra entirely (if you can fit one on) but absolutely adorable pattern and great summer look- just not on me."
3.0,I returned this because the lace was a bit scratchy.
3.0,"Not happy but, The chain itself is nice it has a nice weight to it also I ordered a 20 inch and they sent me a 18 inch I already have an 18 inch chain so now I have 2 18inch chains and I go on vacation Friday<br />So I’m really pissed off 😡"
3.0,"Slightly smaller than sized, hard to do hook closure with arthritic hands and itchy, even after washing."
3.0,Very nice lenses but have the disadvantage that the finish is lost pins
3.0,The fabric is very soft.  But it was very thin and flimsy and you can see all the details of my body.  Dis not like that about it.
3.0,Loved this! Well I wanted to but it was see through! Wanted the black but they are were out of my size. Fits perfectly though.
3.0,Not that cool looking in person. Ok quality
3.0,"I got a xs and the bottoms are very very big, i am 5 flat and 135lbs"
3.0,"Very warm and breaks the wind. My only complaint is that the zipper has never worked. Others in my swim group have had the same problem. Packing and sending it back was really too hard. Other than the zipper, it is wonderful."
3.0,It looks exactly like the pictures so its so cute. I tried it on my daughter and it fit exactly like i thought it would. Shes two and usually wears 18-24 months so i got it a little bigger. It seems to be a good quality coat. So im sure your wondering why i gave it a 3 star instead of the 5 it should have had. Well i unzipped this vacuum sealed coat and as soon as i opened it the strongest smell of fish just smacked me in my face. My daughter was suppose to wear the coat the next day but ofcourse that couldnt happen because im still waiting for the smell to leave. It also isnt the whole coat. Just the fur on the hood. Its doing better but im still waiting. Update on if the smell leaves soon.
3.0,The material seemed thin. I kept one and sent one back and I would not buy again.
3.0,I find myself having to adjust the tension a couple times a day. Not a good belt for a daily carry. Just needs some more rigidity. Love the buckle.
3.0,Order your aspirational size not your actual size. Runs very large.
3.0,Not what I expected looks better on the picture to me than on...
3.0,Pants are shapeless
3.0,Comfortable shorts. I liked the feel and look of them but the color red was just too bright for what I was looking for
3.0,I got the plain blue dress but no outer coat like they show in the picture with red belt!!
3.0,This is not a blouse top. Runs somewhat big.  More like a t-shirt material.  Color is as it shows. Pretty green.
3.0,"It'll serve it's purpose, but it won't be comfortable. It's super tight behind the ears, and lopsided, so it doesn't want to sit straight on your face."
3.0,They are very cute and light weight. I’m assuming they meant to send an additional pair of backs but I only got the ones that were attached to the earrings and one back in a zip lock bag.
3.0,The yellow is pretty brigth and I have already maxxed out the space.  The wallet has begun to come appart at the top seem.  This would be a good wallet for someone who does not have a lot of need to stow membership/ business cards.  I do receive many compliments on thisk unique wallet.
3.0,"very slippery, falls off of me when walking or moving"
3.0,Runs large & very thin
3.0,"Looks cute, but it's pretty cheap once you get your hands on it."
3.0,I was so excited to receive the dress only to be very disappointed when it didn't fit. Apparently they run quite small. But the dress itself seemed to have good quality and it looked exactly like the picture.
3.0,"I love the shirt, but after only 2 or 3 washing's it is starting to ball."
3.0,"These come exactly as pictured.  I think they are adorable, but these are meant for those that are petite/short.  Going by their sizing description, I SHOULD be able to fit into these no problem.  But, if you're taller than maybe 5'4, they will be way too short and not be pulled up."
3.0,The nose rings are cute but they are not what is being advertised. Some of the nose rings look way bigger than 20g and are much thicker than the others. I was unable to try on the rings due to the sizing.
3.0,Nice but sent it back because I preferred bigger beads. They need to put a bead chart so you can see the actual size.
3.0,"Cute style, vibrant color, but not the best quality. Some stitching was exposed, stiff opening of main storage area. The storage capacity is great though, holds a lot."
3.0,Can’t expect too much for sure I paid $20 for but the soul lining fell apart
3.0,It's a little bit bigger than I thought but very pretty. Very sparkly. Look better than the picture.
3.0,Loved the style though would have preferred lighter frames on the front - however they don't work because the fake lenses are glued in and my prescription lenses could not be inserted - these were evidently only for fashion.  I didn't know that people wear glasses for fashion who don't need them!!!
3.0,Good little socks. Not very durable though. Some pairs in the set have holes after just a few wears/washes.
3.0,"Nice large umbella. But ... 1. there is a stress area on the connecting plastic fitting that attaches umbella to the support pole. Only had umbella for 4 weeks don't know if that will continue to weaken and break. 2. I bought a Hunter green one , after 2 weeks it has faded several shades.( color difference notice after leaving it closed using the strap around umbella while we were gone on vacation)  I did purchase a cover but still I should be able to leave it uncover during season of use without fading."
3.0,"I wouldn't have purchased this in a store if I felt the material before-hand. it's not the softest material, but the sweater is ""okay"" - I'll probably just give it to a friend in need."
3.0,Material gets run easily but seems to help with the cold
3.0,sexy lil dress
3.0,"Immediately broke the band adjustment tool, so it's too big."
3.0,The material is a little heavier than I expected for a summer dress and the v in the back is higher than it appeared in the design and it drags the ground.
3.0,Only covers toes barley
3.0,"It was a bit short, fit as expected but because of the cut the shortness makes it wierd to wear."
3.0,"Shoe is super comfortable, helps with the pain in my foot! However the quality is a bit subpar. The stitching on the side is starting to come undone, despite light wear. I have a pair of black one that have been super durable so far so it’s a little disappointing. So far the threading doesn’t affect being able to wear this."
3.0,Very heavy and quite blocky. I thought they'd be thinner.
3.0,I anticipated that they would be a little larger. They were for a gift and the recipient was pleased
3.0,"I was excited when he scarf arrived because it felt very soft. It had a weird perfumey/chemical smell which still isn't completely gone after 2 washes. After washing once it was immediately pilly and snagged. I let it hang dry and did not put it through the dryer. I haven't even worn it yet, but not really worth returning. I will use it, but it's not the best quality."
3.0,"Watch id fine, but the band is too small."
3.0,"As others said, the shirt isn’t the same as shown. There’s an annoying red stripe down the v and it looks cheaper all together. But it is a super soft material!"
3.0,"Beautiful, but it was broken when I receive it..."
3.0,Color not flattering. Fit awful. Would not wear at all.
3.0,Cheap material but ok for some things.
3.0,"I'm totally satisfied with the material, color, and timely delivery. However, the sizes are a bit small. I have an athletic build, so the jacket is a bit tight in the shoulders. Also, the pants are the ""slim-fit"" style, which are too tight on my thighs. So I would recommend ordering a size that's a bit larger than what you'd normally wear, and then get it tailored. That's what I'll do for my next order."
3.0,I really liked the shirt. They don't carry an XS or else it would have been perfect.
3.0,"Eh, their OK. They are a little small but that is to be expected from compression wear. They are just very hard to get on after 4 spinal surgeries and limited mobility."
3.0,Did not fit what so ever
3.0,I thought that the product would provide support to shoulders and back - it is not what I had expected
3.0,The shoes are cute. I had them sent to my daughter. She said that they were great for special occasions but wouldn’t hold up for every day use.
3.0,Fabric is very thin.  Almost see thru.
3.0,"It’s hard to see on the listing, but it’s a very difficult color of light teal in the lighter pattern, and it clashes with everything similar that I’ve tried it with."
3.0,"I really like the look, and the feel of this swim Jammer. It arrived in good time too. The negative, and  why I gave 3 stars instead of 5, is there is no support for my package. My package will try to go down one of the legs, and it partially did which didn't feel comfortable and it made me self conscious. I will try them with some kind of supporter and see if I can actually use it."
3.0,"Nice swimsuit, fits me great (but I ordered a size larger as many people recommended). The first order was missing a shoulder belt (the shawl on the picture and from a description) so after talking to an Amazon representative I returned the first order and re-ordered, came again without it. I let it go..."
3.0,"Arrived in a timely manner but paint was worn on lettering within the necklace making it difficult to read, not worth trying to pay shipping to send back."
3.0,Too glittery. Great decor but can be seen as fake.
3.0,"I accidentally ordered a size up and figured it would be okay if they were a little loose. But they are at least a size too small for me, meaning they run two sizes too small. It's so unfortunate because they are really cute in person. Love the color and the design and the fit would be great. If you get these, be sure to size up."
3.0,"I have bought this Calida nightgown for the past 20 yrs. Unfortunately, they are currently manufactured outside of Switzerland and the quality has suffered. I can only wear my new one inside out as the thread used on the bodice and other seams is rough and irritating. It’s a shame as this night gown has been a staple for yrs. but it will be my last purchase unless they change the thread."
3.0,I have no idea how they liked these
3.0,They're alright. really light weight. they werent the material i was hoping for. they just werent what i expected. they look nice and all but they just feel and look cheap. i didnt like them.
3.0,For all that is good and holy size up!!!!
3.0,There should be a way make it flexible at the bottom. That would make it easier to use.
3.0,Not knee high
3.0,For the price the best should have a better fit.
3.0,Super cute! Very adorable outfits for Easter but omg the shoulder straps kept sliding off. Super annoying!
3.0,"Cute dress and it fits, but I’m afraid to wash it for fear it will fall apart. I am going to re-enforce these buttons and some of the seams first. There are loose threads everywhere, and the buttons were very loose when trying on."
3.0,The buttons fell off right away
3.0,"This was a very small purse and very cheap looking. I got it for my pre-teen and I think it would be better for a ""play purse"" for a younger child."
3.0,They were thin and developed holes after 1 or 2 washings!
3.0,"These are def adorable, and if you love possums you will love these socks! My only complaint is that they are advertised as being good for “hiking”, which made me think they’d be thicker than what they actually are. When I opened the package, I was surprised to see VERY thin socks; perfect for shopping or wearing around the house, but if you wore these hiking you’d have blisters in no time flat. I’m also concerned with how long the socks will actually last, if worn frequently. Time will tell..."
3.0,"Third star is for notably low price, versus a fine piece which would cost far more.  I knew that this item, for an important gift occasion, would not be extremely impressive, but the light weight and ""blurry"" lack of detail of the molding was mediocre at best.  I do not have time to replace with a different item so must live with my decision, and hope that gift recipient finds it so much fun that the mundane quality can be overlooked.  Thanks."
3.0,I like this outfit should of got a bigger size for comfort
3.0,Got these for my husband and was disappointed by the fact that hes had them 2 weeks and the gold paint on the deathly hallows symbol has already faded.
3.0,"I will say that I didn’t expect much considering on the price and how cheap it was compared to others. I put it on and immediately knew that it wouldn’t look that good on its own and that adjustments would have to be made.<br />The section that outlines where your chest would fill it is clear, but there’s no elastic or anything to bring it closer to your body along that line so essentially there is no point in it being there. Also I was hoping that the layers would look more like a ruffled effect and I could barely say that is the case.<br />That being said, the length surprised me by being super long. I was expecting a dress that ended around my knees put the dress was at least 8 inches past my knees. Most dresses that have that kind of length add on extra to the price just because of that length on its own. Plus the dress is really light and picks up wind easily so if you walk outside and it’s windy, the dress will rise up that extra 8 inches that’s on there. At that point you’ll be happy that it’s that long so your underwear will still be hidden."
3.0,"I purchased this glittery dress in the green color which is quite nice for the holidays.  The fit was absolutely perfect as it fit like the model. I’m 5 feet even and a curvy 120 lbs. i got the small.  For reference I’m a 32dd bust.  I didn’t have any issues with the actual fit of the dress. Fabric was not itchy or see through.  The problem with this dress is the split in the back. If you bend even a little, you’d give a show to the world and everyone would learn a little more about you.  The split is literally at the end of my butt cheeks.  WAYYY too high. I’m sure it could be taken to the tailor to close it up some but I didn’t have time to do that and I didn’t want to put in the effort to do it. Other than the high split it’s very nice. The manufacturer of this dress should really consider making the split much shorter, possibly 3 inches long or less or so. The split makes it easy to walk in but it’s just excessive.  If you like this dress, I don’t blame you. It’s flattering on a curvy body and that sparkling fabric ( no loose glitter to fall off) is so eye catching but the split, I had to pass.  I decided on a different dress I purchased from Amazon."
3.0,"Would have been a 5-star, but....The &#34;artwork&#34; is not centered with a slight tilt.  Didn't notice it until after I washed it and wearing it the first time under a sweat shirt.  My bad.  Just look for the image alignment like I didn't."
3.0,Nice slippers but more for indoor use only.
3.0,Kind of looks as expected . A little much and hurt the top part of my ear. I think if the stones were a little smaller it would have been a little less Star Trek looking and less cheap. However it was cheap so I can't complain .
3.0,"Looked and fit great, but it rusted really quickly"
3.0,These are actually nice shorts considering how ridiculously cheap they are. I did have to finish sewing one of the pockets where the factory missed some stitching otherwise they would be 5 stars.
3.0,"I ordered a medium and it was to tight. I sent it back and reordered a large. It's ok, could be a half inch larger. This item runs a little smaller, buy a larger size."
3.0,Great fit but when I got it there was a small hole in it. I hate holes so I'll have to give it to someone.
3.0,"needs more padding over pubic bone; otherwise, good."
3.0,Pretty wide - have to wear socks to keep them on.
3.0,The tshirt is not great quality but my 6 year old nephew loves it.
3.0,"The tag part itself is great, very cute style.  But he straps/buckles are terrible.  I'm seriously just going to go buy a zip tie somewhere to strap the tag to my suitcase because it's so cheap."
3.0,"They are really cute and I like them so much. The only thing they are very light and not a good material, but good looking."
3.0,"This was my first replacement from the original band. It as easy to install, but the band did only last 3 months; vs the original which lasted 6 months. It did have a nice feel to it and I used it every day, but could have been rough on it.  The rubber tore off from the watch face.  Overall I have no remorse from purchasing this product, but I am buying a different one now."
3.0,It was a little baggy on me so I only ever worn it like twice.
3.0,"Love the way this cute top paired with my blue jeans, however the material is a bit thin and probably meant to hang dry instead of putting it in the dryer! Wish I realized that before!"
3.0,"They weren't very comfortable for me, they hurt my nose! I ended up returning them."
3.0,"A touch small, definitely a belly shirt, but still cute."
3.0,"I bought five pairs for my bridesmaids. They are pretty, but three pairs are missing at least one of the smaller white diamonds."
3.0,Everything was good 😌 until I realized I had 2 hinata’s & not 1 kuroo 😭 when I was taking the plastic sticker off the keychain noyas tail was broken 🥲 if there was only an option we can just select an item instead of buying the 12 pac it’ll be awesome 😭 but other then that they are cute
3.0,"Design was great but too tight fitting , I'm 5'1 115 lbs girl , size was ok , so not sure if medium would be better ."
3.0,Fits fine.  The print is very flawed.
3.0,"Not really impressive. The shirt is a bit different from the photos.<br />The material is decent, not thin or too thick, soft. It is pretty short...so if you are a 5 ft it might be the perfect length."
3.0,"Material could be better, the sleeved shirts have a better material than these."
3.0,"Very bummed about the fit. I ordered up and it still was waaay too tight on my chest. Pretty blouse, though, and my tiny sister loves it!"
3.0,"Cute images on masks and a nice variety. However, these are not adjustable. They are a little too snug/tight for adults to wear yet a little too big on my 6yo. They served us no purpose. However, they would probably fit a preteen/younger teen aged boy/girl perfect!"
3.0,I have ordered several soccer socks for my daughter.....she liked the color and it looked good with her uniform but said they were too big and made her cleats uncomfortable
3.0,"The bath wrap was pretty and my daughter loved it. However, the material itself was not the greatest. Very thin and not soft nor fluffy."
3.0,This charm is very heavy and therefore flips upside down on bracelet. Detail is very good. Pretty addition to my bracelet.
3.0,Granddaughter loved the
3.0,"I received the wrong dress. It was similar but the top was different. It was pretty tight. I am a size 16 and 18, 40DDD"
3.0,"Bought this same watch from a foreign website.  I knew there were risks involved using an unknown and foreign site but the price was about $11 less at that site.  Fortunately everything worked out well as the delivery was pretty fast considering it was shipped from China.  It's features are as described.  It was fairly easy to set up because I have had a couple of similar watches.  The watch face is huge, relative to my other men's watches.  One feature that I wished it had is dual time.  Comes in real handy when traveling across the country or continents.  One other thing that takes a little getting used to is that they have same font size for hours, minutes, and seconds.  I am used to viewing the seconds in a smaller font size.  Lastly, the watch came with the battery already activated.  I have had other digital watches where you had to push buttons to activate the battery, thus hopefully a longer life battery.  Came with set up instructions."
3.0,"These are fun for birthday party favors, but you get what you pay for. 2 of the glasses didn't work coming right out of the package and they physically break easy. Otherwise they served their purpose and the kids loved them."
3.0,Kinda dark but its cute and the price worth it:-)
3.0,The material was thick but very stretchy. Not ideal if you live in Arizona like I do. There was too much room in the top and I have a D cup.
3.0,"I just logged in to review a bunch of different items. I purchased this three months ago for my husband for Christmas. Now that I am familiar with the product when I saw the price I thought, ""Wow, the price must have gone up. Surely I did pay $45 for that keychain."" Now that I look back at my records, it appears that I did. Yikes.<br /><br />The keychain is nice, but it is not worth more than $20 or so - and that is being generous. It is rather thin and looks like the emblem was glued onto the keychain. If it wasn't a gift it would have gone straight back.<br /><br />Editing to add: just 2 months after this review (5 months after purchase) the logo fell off the keychain. Bummer!"
3.0,I bought 5 of these as stocking stuffers. Cute and fashionable…. Smells horribly like chemicals that will probably give you cancer.
3.0,It’s fine and I got it on sale so I’ll probably keep it. It is definitely not sweatshirt material. Very light knit and the pattern is printed on not actually tie-dye.  Runs a little small. If you’re between sizes go up a size. I was really hoping to love this and hoping it was a light sweatshirt but it is not
3.0,"They fit great and are super comfortable, but the only downfall, and this makes them unwearable for me is that when they are on it feels like I have tunnel vision. The sides are see through but not clear. Its like a distorted image in your peripheral vision.  It made me dizzy :("
3.0,Very comfortable however they are definitely petites. I am only 5'3 & the bottoms barely cover my ankles.
3.0,To tight around belly
3.0,"Very nice design and color, the size is perfect, but do not close the back is not, however they are very beautiful"
3.0,I like the colors on the beads. I dont like that the two laced chains are too lose. The lace is very fragil.
3.0,Wearing it for long travels causes poor circulation on the welt. Too snug of a sock cuff. Was uncomfortable after a few hours. Might be good for shorter travel times.
3.0,Very cute design but it's way too small. Our son is only 2 (albeit top 90 percentile in height) and it barely fits even when fully lengthened.
3.0,"I ordered this TeesRoom Women's American Horror Story Hoodie for my daughter who LOVES American Horror Story. I kind of knew from past experiences with Asian sizing that it runs small so I ordered a size bigger then I normally would have for her ( which according to their sizing chart and how it compares to US sizing should have been perfect, so there comparison to US sizing in their size chart is off ) and it was still too small. I should have ordered one more size up. The sweatshirt is 100% cotton and more of a light weight material. You should wash it inside out and lay it out or hang it to dry, which I already do with all my printed shirts as it helps to preserve the printing. I did notice the print on the front was not printed on quite straight and dropped a little lower on one side. However, in all fairness, I should add that I used to work in a printing manufacturing plant where I did quality assurance looking for this type of problem before they were shipped out so I am sure it is a lot more noticeable to me then it may be to everyone else. My advice if you purchase this sweatshirt is to be cautious of what size you are ordering and order at least TWO sizes up from what you need.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review. This in no way impacts the review I left, my review is based solely on my personal opinion and the experience I have had with this product."
3.0,"I have a big butt, it won’t go over the whole<br />Thing"
3.0,"It is the exact colors, it’s soft, but It is short."
3.0,Perfect for St Patrick’s Day; bright; colorful; lightweight.
3.0,It's nice really sticky
3.0,"I agree with the other reviews that say this barbell is sharp. I have other spiked jewelry and bought this barbell to match, but the spikes are sharp compared to my other jewelry. There are times when I'm in bed and they scratch along my pillow and I have to check to make sure my pillow didn't get snagged (it hasn't.. so far). The good news is, I haven't had any kind of allergic reaction to the barbell. Its been in my ear 24/7 since it arrived. So, I'm happy with my purchase 🙂"
3.0,"It has a single hour for the timer before it rolls over, and the light only illuminates half of the watch face.<br /><br />It's a solid product otherwise, and keeps track of the month so that you don't have to adjust anything for when the month rolls over. I really like the toggle for 12/24 hour."
3.0,"It's what your expect of an Amazon dress. The material is not the greatest, but it has good shape and it matches the product. Very stretchy material. Definitely worth the money for a cute, stylish, yet cheap dress.<br />Planning to order in another color."
3.0,I think these work for a child
3.0,"Looks ok price great and all but you will have to buy like two size over. I wear a size 10 and I got this in 11 but it didn’t fit well. It fit too tight and it feels like it’s cutting into you finger if you leave it on for a long period and it bruises your finger. It also scratch easily, don’t recommend for daily wear"
3.0,"I liked it but it was too snug, even after ordering a XL for my 12/14 size frame.  It would have been great had I not gained these additional ice cream pounds.  Dress was lovely but had to be returned.  It also does not indicate that there is an opening in the back which prevents you from wearing a bra.  I CANNOT allow these puppies to run free or they will be at my navel."
3.0,I thought it was actually going to have the Star Wars tag in it but it didn't<br /> I'm ordering another one with the Star Wars tag in.
3.0,"I like the length, the color and it's looks good but the material is some what thin and I suggest to wear a body suit underneath unless you want everything to show."
3.0,I didn't know the belt was attached to the dress. so i won't be able to hand wash I would have to put in the cleaners
3.0,"I should have gone with one size larger than my shoe size. I bought the Large 10 -11, but my shoe size is 11. These slippers are tighter than I would like, but I was still able to add an insert to provide for arch support."
3.0,I received the black/white pattern which was more of a cream/yellow than white. 😔
3.0,"Shoulders are not quite right, there is extra fabric in the corners"
3.0,I just need to lose weight.
3.0,"Overall why I even gave a 3 was it is a pretty dress. But, made way too small. I thought it would be made small and bought 2 sizes up for my granddaughter. The biggest size is a 16, granddaughter wears 12, so I did buy the 16. I had to go buy material and take to a seamtress to have the whole back made into a corset because a 16 was still way too small. The dress actually came out beautiful and fit well once the corset was attached."
3.0,Everything was good. Until the little screwdriver stopped working. So now I can’t get one band out :(
3.0,"Very nice product, yet in shopping for an elder relative, did not fit....too long, and for items that button, they need to be big buttons for them to grasp."
3.0,"Little smaller than I would like, but they're okay."
3.0,"[[ASIN:B003DKEW6M Nike Golf Web Belt 3-Pack]] It looked nice when it was listed, after receiving them, they were not that nice, the were not heavy duty belts, yet they cost more."
3.0,"Loved the robe -the look and feel- but did not come with belt/rope as pictured, also pockets were kinda weird."
3.0,Really cute set of earrings but they hurt my ears badly after a couple wears and they break easily. Very fragile so be careful.
3.0,Very similar in colors
3.0,The fabric is very thin and a bit clingy.  The size medium clung to the outline of my jeans even though the top was not too tight.  A large would have hung off my shoulders.  Nice grey color--wish it had worked.
3.0,"Don't get me wrong, they feel secure and well fitting. The only exception is they ride up your buttcrack!"
3.0,I loved my watch band but the elasticity only lasted for about 6 months. I had to buy a replacement by the end of June. If you have several to switch out instead of wearing one exclusively it’d last much longer.
3.0,Thought it was supposed to be 100 percent wool - guess I didn't read closely enough.
3.0,fits a little big
3.0,"Okay pants, a little longer.  Very light.  Comparable to $20 tractor supply pants, just more expensive"
3.0,"The shirt is nice but the material is very thin. I ordered a size larger than I would normally wear, and it was quite a bit bigger than expected. However, it was delivered on time as expected."
3.0,"I didn't realize this was some sort of bandanna hat. I thought this was a head wrap, like you wrap around your head & tie it. This is not that, its a hat type, you cant even tie it because its already tied & has a form to the inside. My 4 year old plays with this & it falls off his head. This doesn't even fit mine or my husbands head either, its quite large. The skull on it is cool & the color red is bright, its very pirate-y. Overall, its okay. I will have to figure out something to make it fit, maybe adding some elastic in the inside form.<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"First time ever using anything like this, so keep that in mind when reading this.  I used these to keep my shirt tucked in for my wedding.  They felt very weird to wear ... like a was a puppet when I walked.  But the product did do its job.  The clamps held all day, and my shirt stayed tucked in all day.  I wasn't sure if they were supposed to be under the sock or over the sock, but I put them on after my socks.  I could've been wearing them not quite right, but it seemed odd that the loop wasn't tight on my foot, which left a big gap.  The clips never irritated my skin or anything though, which was nice."
3.0,Nice dress but small on the Top.
3.0,"Nice, but no sealant tape"
3.0,"not bad, but one of the the lenses came off after three days of use"
3.0,"I am curvy, 185lbs, and 5'4. I bought this in a 12 (L) and it fits somewhat big. I probably should have went down a size. Its not a bad dress, but it probably would have been even better if I went down a size. The material is very stretchy. I wore this to a Symphony and received many compliments, but I don't know if I will wear it again without getting it altered."
3.0,"Very thin material, should be fine for a beach cover up."
3.0,Like it... but it runs very small.
3.0,"Very cute and pretty comfy but we have to return due to sizing. My son normally wears a 5Y shoe, so that’s what I bought. It was so big that it fit my foot- a women’s 7.5!"
3.0,"Returned, Material to thin, might need a slip or spanx not what I was expecting! True to size you might want to order a size up wouldn't hurt!"
3.0,"Wasn't overly impressed with the quality, and the skirt part started way too low - super weird fit.  Skirt was also on the tighter side and not flowy."
3.0,I mean i bought for low pricess but what the heck it was still worth it to play around and wear them. But one problem it was so uncomfterble hurt my teeth at times! Maybe couse i did not mold it very well in hot water will putting it in my teeth. Maybe it was my problem but othter than that it was fun to use them.
3.0,Falling down my face but cute style!
3.0,"They fabric was beautiful but the shorts were way too to tiny. Had to go up in size. Otherwise, they looked cute on her"
3.0,"I like the material because it's very comfortable. The pockets are great! However, they are see through and that's basically the only problem I ever have with legging. I could care less about the material as long as they aren't see through and these are. Like I said, I love the pockets, but I hate see though leggings!"
3.0,"This bathing suit is adorable and my granddaughter loves it! That said, there is a major drawback to it. While the top is true to size and fits perfectly, the bottoms are made really strangely. The waistband is perfect and the fit is great, except that the leg holes are huge! They’re way to big and out of scale with the rest of the garment. They will make for very sandy bottoms and for not enough coverage of personal bits.  It’s too bad because the suit really is cute otherwise."
3.0,Matched as advertised.
3.0,Not the best quality. Not bad for back up but probably would not order again.
3.0,Doesn't hold the amount of cards it claims
3.0,Did not like that most of them were Christmas themes. That was not clear when I purchased them so I can't use most of them and have to wait until Christmas to try and use them
3.0,Nice dress but belt doesn't attach so it doesn't stay put.
3.0,do like the cap but I must roll it under to fit my small head.
3.0,Could barely see the Breast Cancer emblem.
3.0,"Cute style.  A bit see-through, so a slip is required."
3.0,The color is sweet and it fits me.. But the quality of the product is not as expected.
3.0,Beautiful top size up and it is perfect
3.0,Broke to quick it did not last long
3.0,"love these! only downside is i got 5 instead of 6, which sucks, also one if them wouldn't come off the bar even with pliers and two of them i already swallowed because they wouldn't stay on the bar in my mouth. but they are really cute which is the only plus"
3.0,"My girl loved it but there is only one problem, color faded little bit within 5 to 6 days but still she is happy and she wears it every single day."
3.0,The gold wasn't gold enough it was very fake lookong!
3.0,"It looked really nice, but it does not look like the picture. The sleeves are really tight (tighter than shown in the image) and it's not that long, so if you want that oversized look you should probably get a size bigger.<br />I got a medium which fit fine, but the arms were so tight that I returned it."
3.0,They're really pretty but a little too small.
3.0,The shirt was a little small.
3.0,Fit was small and the color IS PINK not the dusty rose as pictured.
3.0,it would have been a great shirt if it fit right the xl fit more like a lg i liked the look but just to small it is stretchy but i wanted a more loose fit
3.0,Very small and fake looking
3.0,"Overall fit as expected, but the legs are long for me to be Capri. I'm 5'3&#34; and they almost come to my ankles. High yoga waist was comfy."
3.0,"This top is disappointing to me - it is not as nice as the picture makes it look. The fabric itself is sort of numbly, rather than being silky smooth, and the dark color faded after just one, gentle wash. That color now looks literally ""washed out,"" making the top look much older than it actually is. The construction of the garment I received is good, and I will keep it to wear with jeans when I'm dressing ""weekend casual,"" but I can't dress up in this top, not since it really is nowhere near as elegant as the picture makes it seem. Three stars only."
3.0,"I think I would’ve loved this bra, but the sizing is way off. I’m usually a small or XS and I initially ordered a small. It was tiny. I then ordered a medium and it was just as tight as the small! Sending both back, but looked like if it fit it would’ve been soft and comfortable."
3.0,"my wife ordered a medium. She is a size 6 and a 34D. the Bottoms were fine, but the top was too small. The size chart for this item, was not very helpful. Although the item seemed quality in make, we ultimately returned the item due to the fit."
3.0,"In the picture, they make this shirt look like it has shape, that the arms are flowy, that it's tapered in toward the waist.  They had it tied back.  This is just a regular shaped t-shirt that will not do anything to give you shape.  If that's all you're looking for, by all means get this.  It's a nice material and comfortable."
3.0,People might think that I brought it from a $1.99 store
3.0,Got these for travel and they have potential. The adhesive is strong but had a bad tendency to peel away from pants fabric and adhere to my skin. Ouch! If you can keep them stuck in place they are great.
3.0,Cute but way to small
3.0,"This top looks ok, but the fabric is a bit thin. It is slightly larger than expected. Comfortable."
3.0,"These sunglasses look awesome, and the Bamboo offers great style. However the tint on these is sub-par, they are hardly sunglasses. If they are polarized, it's difficult to tell because they hardly block the sun."
3.0,The chokers were very cute and nicely packaged but not assembled with the best quality.  The ones with a pendant on them-the ribbon was wrapped around the main ribbon and one end attached to the clamp on the front of the main ribbon and the other end on the back of the main ribbon so you couldn’t “untangle” it.  I considered keeping them for the few that were okay but ended up returning them.
3.0,material resembles that if a Halloween costume.
3.0,"First off the material is awesome!!! things I didn't like was the fact this costume had to many pieces to it. the pieces that went over my shoulders, kept on sliding off. I had to go to a tailor, they sewd those suckers on and altered the sleeves. That's when it looked cool."
3.0,Very cheap. And I have had good cheap earings. These were not that great. Could have spent 10 bucks for one pair I know is great. Win some loose some.
3.0,The one I wore broke within days I'll be buying some jewelry wire to put it back together I suppose.
3.0,Very cute necklace however the 'silver' areas became discolored very quickly.
3.0,This is a basic shirt that can be worn under a suit jacket or dress it down with jeans.<br />I felt like I was wearing a pajama top though as the material felt like satin. I also think the sizing is off. I got a small but I think it was a tad too big for me. It would have been nice to have one more button on the top of the shirt. That is just a personal preference.<br />The tag mentioned to dry clean but I am not the type to bring my shirts to dry cleaners so I hand washed it and hung on line to dry. It came out fine.
3.0,Took forever to get to us.  Then broke after one wearing.  Paid for what I got.
3.0,"The shirts are well-made and comfortable material, but they seem to run small. My granddaughter wears an 8 and I really should have ordered a 10."
3.0,The necklace is cute but easily tangles. The aide straps are wider apart than what you see in the picture making the necklace bulge when it tangles. I wore this and was constantly needing to adjust. It made me a bit self conscious to need to keep checking it. It also doesn't have an extender to make longer.
3.0,"Didn’t fit me right, but it was good for the price"
3.0,"This dress is very thick. I got my size (medium) but it was small over my chest, but fit ok the rest of the way. It makes a good winter dress."
3.0,Wished it was better made
3.0,I LOVED this bag so much I wanted one in every color!  In less than a month three of the pockets in the lining came apart.  I cannot seem to find one similar I like as much.  I am so disappointed as I’ve never enjoyed the looks and function of a handbag as much as this one.
3.0,"I would give 5 stars if I would have gotten everything I paid for. The main reason why I purchased this particular set was because of the extra pieces that came with it. I wanted to have my own stuff for my bass but unfortunately not going to happen. The original packaging was sliced which led to pieces missing.<br /><br />MISSING: picks, strap locks and strap studs.<br /><br />Overall, the feel of the actual guitar strap feels and looks decent. I will be trying it out on my bass this weekend. The small leather strap looks and feels kinda cheap."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings about this. The material is nice, the fit is just all wrong. It’s not fitted at the top and flared at the bottom, it’s just kind of straight down and not very flattering. I got it in an XL but I think a L would’ve fit me better. It’s huge. I’m heavy set at the bottom with D cup breasts and it’s just really really big. Looks like a sack."
3.0,"This is an overall very cute wireless bra, but I honestly don’t love it. It’s extremely comfortable and soft so I like that about it. It wasn’t very supportive and made me look saggy even with the straps as tightened as I could get them, though, so not very flattering. I am larger in the bust area, DD cups, and I ordered a large to be sure the cups were sufficient enough. This seems to run a little large, though, based on the fit. Great idea, but I just think this is not ideal for larger chested women."
3.0,Very nice piece but I can only give it three stars because the cross has very sharp edges that cut you you smooth out the edges and you will have a very fine piece of jewelry .
3.0,I brought this brand in a different style rash guard and these are a little cheaper feeling and it doesn’t felt as nice as the other style. Over all the price is good. I wouldn’t buy it again but I wouldn’t return it because I can still wear it just won’t buy it again.
3.0,"Like the graphics, but printed on a cheap & thin fruit o' loom shirt and runs small, probably wont fit after it is washed.  Not worth the price charged in my opinion."
3.0,The material is really thin and fits snugly
3.0,"A little smaller thank I thought, but pretty."
3.0,"When I first saw it, I loved it. I was a little heartbroken, however, that one of the hooks broke easily as i was inserting it into my ear. The other one is fine. I wear it with my other earrings, as some sort of unsymmetrical style."
3.0,Two small ridges prevents the band from fitting tightly. They leave a gap between the bands and the Veryfit pro
3.0,Not 108 beads.
3.0,"The right hand glove came with some sort of gross stain on it, and some of the stitching around the edges came loose."
3.0,I ordered an extra large to make sure that it would fit but it was probably two sizes smaller than a normal xl.
3.0,Screw came out a few times now I've lost it. Easy fix with some loctite. I'll try that if I reorder.
3.0,"They looked nothing like, or felt nothing like 100% cotton."
3.0,Bra straps showing are a huge problem. A strapless bra is a must.
3.0,These earrings arrived in time. Although they are very pretty they are definitely not green at all. Disappointed in the color.
3.0,"This outfit is ADORABLE, but the sizing was so off that half the onesie was hidden by the tutu."
3.0,The Godfather keychain came scratched
3.0,I’ve been buying 1inch key fob hardware for many years from different places. This hardware is somehow just under an inch but only slightly maybe a millimeter or so. It’s just enough that my 1inch strapping sticks out beyond the edges. Also the prongs are all bent too far downward (or in other directions) and they do not hook into the strapping well making the hardware loose on the keychain. Attempting to bend the prongs weakens the metal making it easy to break off. Trying to make these work but overall not pleased.
3.0,"In general, this band is serving me better than the silicone band that came with my Galaxy watch. It is attractive and matches the rose gold well. There is a slight discoloration on part of it, but since it ends up being obscured within the folded portion, it doesn't bother me. The ability to make minute adjustments to the sizing is very helpful and I find it more comfortable because of that. It is easy to remove and adjust because of the magnet closure, but it always feels secure and I have never had issue with it falling off.<br /><br />One of the few negative comments I have is that the links in the flexible band seem slightly pointed and get caught on things with loose weave, like sweaters. The other negative is that the flexible links, as well as the metal adjustment link, are pretty sharp. I have been wearing it for almost a month now, and on at least a daily basis, I have to adjust or remove the watch because the edges of the band dig into my skin or the adjustment link becomes extremely painful to the point that I'm concerned it might've broken the skin from poking into the underside of my wrist where the skin is tender.<br /><br />Generally, this band is pretty good... I just wish it wasn't so sharp."
3.0,Hot on the inside. Can’t wear when I’m active at work.
3.0,The shirt is comfortable however very cheaply made. It looks like a child sewed some pockets on the front of the shirt. It does fit and arrived in a timely manner.
3.0,"Thin material, but fit and image are good."
3.0,Very sheer fabric. Wish it was a bit thicker
3.0,Was a bit large for my face
3.0,"The packaging didn't come as it looked in the pics, the chain is a cheap link chain that I know will snap if it gets even a gentle tug. Other than that it's a cute charm, but I'd buy a different chain for sure!"
3.0,The dress is very short 😞<br />It’s cute though.
3.0,"Shirt is nice and soft. Pretty color looks just like the photo. Washed on cold and hung to dry. Didn't bleed at all. Stitching looks very good. Normally wear a large, but I wanted the shirt to fit the way it does on the model, so I went up 2 sizes. Fits just like the pic by ordering up. Whenever I'm unsure about fit, I always order up since I can alter it to make it smaller much easier than making it bigger. The shirt is fairly thin, but a nude bra will work fine under the wine red."
3.0,"""MAMA"" never stays upright always flips upside down. Quality is OK but I am disappointed that the necklace never lays correctly.  I don't wear it often for this reason."
3.0,"Stretchy, soft material. I sized up as I feel that it will shrink after washing. I'm going to hang to dry for the same reason. The peacock blue is MUCH brighter than pictured. I wouldn't have ordered it if I'd known that. It's for sleeping so, it is what it is. Also.. made in China."
3.0,"Ok, so I LOVED THIS WATCH, up until yesterday, when the watch face, behind the protective glass got foggy, and eventually now has like condensation inside the glass. It was great for like 3 months, but now it's just unattractive, but it keeps ticking, so the mechanics are great, just something is off.<br /><br />UPDATE: The condensation cleared up after about a month, and I still wear it and enjoy the simplicity. As time goes on, it does start ticking a bit slower and gets behind, so it has to be reset about once a month, and this did start to do this before the condensation issue.<br /><br />UPDATE #2: About a year into the expedition with this watch, it stopped working completely, my guess it stems from the condensation issue."
3.0,"The glasses look nice, but they are quite small. Not at all &#34;oversized&#34;."
3.0,CAUTION.The shirt looks great. HOWEVER immediately after trying it on.. My skin brim out in a rash. There's something in the fabrics. I suggest washing before wearing it! I hope cleaning it will prevent this from happening again.
3.0,"Looked as shown.  Nice visual quality.  However, elastic cording was rather thin.  Cannot recomment for men unless they have very small hands.  My wife liked the bracelets and it fit her."
3.0,I have a small head and still I found the hat was too snug and therefore doesn't feel good. The color is good and the quality is good but the fit is not good. I would not recommend this hat due to the small size. It certainly isn't a one-size-fits-all hat.
3.0,"This shoe runs a little big, and the material is very cheap. And it is very scratchy against my skin. I gave them to a friend. Will not be reordering in a smaller size... Runs about half size too big?"
3.0,Just too short in length and very fragile chain.  Would not support any but the tiniest pendant.
3.0,"Lack of a sizing chart means I'm not sure if they fit as expected.  On my husband, they were big in the waist and tight in the thighs.  Fabric is comfortable"
3.0,It’s a nice skirt.
3.0,"I really like the sprayers and blue bottles. However, one of the sprayers is defective. I contacted the seller but they never offered to replace the defective sprayer. So, 1 star for the seller and 3 stars for the product."
3.0,Dress is nice however the fabric around the skirted area is a little see through; the vendor should invest in using a better quality and/or thicker fabric.
3.0,"stops a lot.........why,???"
3.0,"I have the US Navy version and while it is a very good quality, I have a hard time believing that the US Defense Dept officially sanctioned this Made in China hat!<br /><br />Disgusting! Sad!"
3.0,"Very soft and comfortable, but runs big. Seems are wrinkly."
3.0,For my teenage daughter.  Color is very black. These are not high end. Cheap-ish looking but can definitely still be worn.
3.0,"The sweatshirt is lightweight, perfect for the south.The make of the sweatshirt is slightly off. The arms are way longer than they should be. The neck opening is slightly larger and feels off. I love the color but the over all make is just it’s slightly off."
3.0,I like the way it tightens in the back but I did not expect it to look so much like a bakers cap.
3.0,"They are very cute, but kind of on the flimsy side. They feel like plastic almost. Can't use them for what I bought them for but I will find a use for them."
3.0,"Its OK, the glass ball and chain are nice but I wish the dandelion would have been fuller and fluffier!"
3.0,Everything is good except for Velcro
3.0,Cheap material but comfy. I added a gold Wonder Woman sign and wore blue star leggings for a costume. This helped cover my butt a bit.
3.0,I ordered up size and it’s tight in the chest. But okay in the waist. I wish it was a couple inches longer is rather short
3.0,"This top is cute, but the material used is weird and it runs large and loose. I'd suggest buying a size smaller than you are."
3.0,Not as durable as others I bought they got pulls in them rather quickly
3.0,Small fit and a bit short but I'm 5'10&#34; so everything is a bit short lol. Cute otherwise.
3.0,Shoe was very comfotable
3.0,I was supposed to get 6 bracelets but it only shipped 4. I didn’t get the green ones. Otherwise quality of the bracelets is great. Just wish I would’ve got the green ones because now I do not know how to contact them.
3.0,"Don't get me wrong. The watch itself, excluding the band, is wonderful. It appears to be well made, and it looks great! The problem I have with this watch is that the band it comes with is both cheap, and cannot be resized down enough to fit my wrist. I tried looking for replacement bands, both of higher qaulity, and within my wrist size, but I can find nothing that is compatible. The watch has a weird notch like connection for the band, instead of a straight one, barring it from just about any standard band replacements.<br /><br />Tl;dr Watch is nice, but the band is poopoo, and you would need a custom band made to replace it due to a notch style band connection.<br /><br />Would not recommend as a gift to anyone. The band is insulting."
3.0,"Looks better in the pic. I was disappointed. It’s just jersey fabric. It doesn’t look any better than the ones I make, but it does have a pocket for a filter."
3.0,"Fits well. The latches aren't what I expected, but they'll do."
3.0,"I was hoping for a no set earring but it still had a backing instead of a 4 prong cast, the stone is fine, not too shiny however people knew it was a fake. my partner thinks they're decent. Will be buying nicer though."
3.0,"The only reason I'm giving it three stars is it doesn't have a button or a zippered pocket; it's disappointing.  But it's lovely and soft and warm and I don't want to send it back, honestly.  I'm going to have to think about if the pocket is actually worth sending it back (I'm going to sew on a button and hook myself).  It's definitely not worth 89.99, so don't get the idea that it's as good as a real spirit hood.  I recommend it."
3.0,The neck line doesn't fit right.  Little too wide around the neck.
3.0,"There is only 1 button and there is some stretch but not enough to get you to order your normal size... Definitely size up. It was thicker than anticipated and I would not classify this as light wear. I liked it but again it didn't fit me so I returned it, something about the button made it look cheap too so I did not purchase again."
3.0,Like the watch...but having a Horrible time setting the time... the on-line guide wasn't much help.
3.0,It’s a lil tight but I’m also a bigger guy I guess
3.0,"Well, I was fooled by the description into thinking these were NEW and were made of SILK, but there are actually &#34;new silk,&#34; which is probably rayon or polyester or something (the tags are in Asian characters, Chinese I guess, so I can't read the actual content...). These also run significantly small compared to size chart given here. I gave three stars because these are solidly sewn and have smooth/regular fabric, so if this is the product you actually want then it's okay quality. I wouldn't recommend these unless tiny polyester shorts is what you have in mind."
3.0,"Not very solid, but still cute"
3.0,Better going to a hair store and look for a hat.  Cheaper and better material.
3.0,"Size fit well, but the material is very thin. To the point where it almost makes it seethrough. Would be perfect if the material was a touch thicker. Exposed mesh at the hips doesn't allow for brief styled underwear."
3.0,no support for my boobs. not recommended if you have any chest whatsoever. flattering and cute otherwise
3.0,Color was way off and big
3.0,Not really compression. Wanted something to smooth out my mid-section but these do not. Good tank tops otherwise.
3.0,"I thought they ran too small, especially (and weirdly) the holes for the legs"
3.0,"It’s made... weird. No matter what I do, I have droopy-poof back. I can get full breast coverage if I sing a secret song to a bridge troll and turn around three times counterclockwise. But even then, there’s no support and the seam that’s supposed to go below the breast decides to straddle the continental divide. And like I said, it always looks like I’m carrying a parasitic twin on my back. Also, not long like the picture, it comes to mid calf on me (5”9 160lbs C cup).<br />I’ll keep it and see if I can find a garden fairy to make it work, but I expected a frock, not a sidequest."
3.0,My girls love these but I bought them for my nearly 6 year old in a size 6-8 and my 11 year old who usually wears a 12-14 fits them.  They are a lot bigger than I expected.  Also the colored ones are very bright.  Almost neon in intensity.
3.0,Not high waisted just normal thong bikini fit. Still a good bikini though and I will keep it.
3.0,"The headbands I received were not the cute ones pictured.  The flowers are gorgeous, but i wish the headband were the ones pictured."
3.0,"It was cute, but it didn't fit very well-- it ran too large. Maybe think about ordering a size down."
3.0,It's a very cute 2 piece outfit. The problem is that the top is very tight around the arms and the skirt is extremely long. If I raise my arms over my head the top slides up exposing the bottom of my breasts. I had to cut the sleeves at the bottom to be able to move my arm around and had to hem the skirt about 5'. I'm 140 pound and 5'4. I ordered the Medium.
3.0,This dress fits weird. I missed the window to return but the top part is too large and the bottom is too snug around my waist. The pattern is nice but I am not able to wear it as a dress given the strange fit. It has worked to use as a long shirt and fold it under at the bottom.
3.0,I returned these. They felt super cheaply.
3.0,"Kinda small, fell off my ear multiple times. But still it is pretty."
3.0,Extremely fitted around the arms and shoulders. Keeping it because it is still a flattering (if uncomfortable) a-line tunic and i’m obsessed with all things pearly.
3.0,Had to add lace to neckline as it was too low. Otherwise comfortable and fit well
3.0,There isn’t really much stretch and runs a bit small. The top design is pretty uncomfortable and slightly irritating.
3.0,Shirt is nice but runs very small. Size up!
3.0,"Very cute, but runs small on top in the chest and arms! Couldn't order up because then the bottom would be too big."
3.0,"iT ISN'T VERY GOOD,CAUSE IT FALLS OFF MY EARS ALL THE TIME,I GAVE ANOTHER 1 TO MY NEIGHBOR & IT FELL OFF  SO SHE LOST IT...."
3.0,Loved everything about it but smaller than expected;  order one size larger than needed.<br /><br />My granddaughter is petite but it still was small had to wear more a a top with leggings
3.0,Itchy on skin during try on however seller accepted product back without issue
3.0,"I liked the fabric, cool and breatheable"
3.0,Haven't quite figured out to to easily use this.  I will write a followup review once I am better at it.
3.0,"Quality of the leather and buckle are both very good.  However, the buckle is extremely heavy and difficult to release.  Unfortunately, I had to return the item as my husband found it functionally inadequate."
3.0,Runs big in size
3.0,Way too big. Love the shirt after I made some major alterations to it.
3.0,Products seems to be well made and I like to  Style.
3.0,"Too large at bust, despite ordering a size smaller than my measurements. Unfortunately returning."
3.0,"The earring setup was beautiful. The pearls were a very nice size. Larger than I expected. The only complaint that I have and the real reason why I purchased them is the color. They ARE considered ""pink"" however, in certain lighting they look like a dirty white. I was really hoping they were the color of the picture. Even though pearls differ in color from pearl to pearl because each oyster is unique, I was really hoping for the bright beautiful color they displayed. Other than that they are nice to wear if you don't mind the lack of saturated color."
3.0,Well I bought this with thought in mind that with all the magnets it has that it would help with pain in my fingers but it has not worked yet in 3 weeks
3.0,It’s ok for the price but not the best
3.0,I am pretty short and this does not go all the way to my ankles. It is also pretty snug up top! so if you are heavy chested you will probably need to size up a good bit. I sized up and it was still pretty snug up top. If the fit was a little better I would have loved it.
3.0,I usually wear a large but found this shirt a bit big on me. I washed it and put it in the dryer hoping it would shrink a little but it didn't. I really don't think it is worth the price.
3.0,"Not a bad fit, but they do tend to ride up into the crotch while riding my bike. maybe a bit longer legged version might have worked better."
3.0,"A little cheap looking, you get what you pay for"
3.0,"There are 10 pairs for a low price, however the quality is not very good. They are also not all the same style in terms of shape and materials.<br />Not big enough for taller men."
3.0,"I ordered a M, but I think it's more of a teen's M, not women's because it was a little too snug. It's a cute style, and colors are true to online, but order up from what you would wear in a teen's size."
3.0,It's a nice looking clicker! Just runs a little big large for my taste. Every time I move my head it wiggles a bunch
3.0,"This band fit the same as the original band, which for me wasn't a positive. I needed a size right between 2 of the holes. It also got dirty super fast and won't come clean. Over all it's a nice cheap way to brighten up your gear fit."
3.0,my daughter  loved it ..thank you
3.0,"Quality is mediocre and fitting is loose. Dress would be a hit if you tailor it to your body shape. But as is, it's a pretty shapeless dress."
3.0,The quality is pretty decent on these. The fit seems to be pretty spot on. Only downside is the zipper on one of the pockets broke after only a couple wears.
3.0,"I bought this for a bridesmaids dress. It came wadded up in a ziplock bag. It is very large in the waist and lacks shape in the lower half of the dress. The buttons also gap, so I will need to wear an undershirt or slip."
3.0,Easy to use and very convenient.
3.0,"I REALLY LIKE THE DRESS, THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE COLOR,  IT LOOK PINK IN THE PICTURE, BUT ACTUALLY IS BEIGE."
3.0,"It was described as ""plisse"" but in fact it was just printed cotton!"
3.0,These are so cute and I love how they fit. The quality is good and there aren't any visible scratches or blemishes. Amazing for $5!<br /><br />Edit: One of the nose pads fell off a few days after receiving the sunglasses (I tried them on a couple of times but never actually wore them outside). I guess I'll figure out how to reattach it...
3.0,"I bought the red/navy color of this band because the black/gray was unavailable, and it's an amazing band. Great quality, thick, soft, tasteful. So when I noticed the black/gray color was back in stock a few weeks later, I ordered it too.<br /><br />However, the black/gray band was significantly longer than the red/navy band, and the tab sticks out way too far for my wrist. And the thick band means it can't be tucked back into itself. Both bands came with very personal hand-written &#34;contact us for any issues&#34; cards, and yet I never received a reply to any of my three inquiries besides a generic &#34;we have received your message&#34; acknowledgement."
3.0,"So I bought these pajamas by the reviews that I read, when I took them out of the package I was so disappointed! They are very stiff almost like a light cardboard feel, 100% cotton? I even tried to wash them and added a lot of softener and they’re still stiff, unfortunately I can’t return them because I washed them! So I am stuck with them, only good thing I can say about him they’re cute and that is it"
3.0,"So, this skirt is nice, great quality and design. But I'm small at the bottom and XS in every brand works. This one flats my little curves and feels super tight."
3.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my wife, so it was disappointing to see that it did not work on arrival. I have a battery on order, but if that doesn't fix it, I'll have to send it back."
3.0,"The material for this is nice (not as thick as the yeti) and only has one inside pocket (yeti has 2), but seems durable, just the same. It won’t stay open (collapses on itself while trying to fill; yeti is rigid).  Arrived with a dent where the bag was folded in the box which is proving difficult to undo. It’s not a horrible bag, but I was expecting it to be better. The yeti is way better and worth the extra $$ (IMO)."
3.0,"Snaps well. Solid construction. Made the mistake of putting on a belt and it caught my prepuce. Maybe constructed a little too well. Took a locksmith and a team of surgeons to fix, but it’s my fault, not the clasp."
3.0,"Dry soft and perfect length, but thin material and see though. You will need to wear a scarf or sweater with it."
3.0,"it's a very nice watch except I can't figure out how to set it, no instructions so you're onyour own...good luck"
3.0,"It seems to be made well, but it's too small (around) for my daughter who is just starting to develop."
3.0,These are beautiful but the wrong size arrived  :(
3.0,"For me these are all wrong. The material isn’t soft. They definitely don’t fit like the picture, picture makes them look firm fitting which they are not. They are straight down.. They are baggie everywhere and the length just makes them look like they are short. It’s not a good look at all."
3.0,I wear a size 16-18 normally and ordered this at their size 20 (xxl).  It was still too tight in the arms.  The fabric isn't very forgiving or stretchy.  Will be returning for something different.
3.0,"My toddler is a fashionista.  She picks out her outfit daily, and has to have accessories to match.  These glasses make her look so cool!  However, they scratch REALLY easily, hence why they only get 3 stars.  That being said, we had the baby version originally, and still bought the toddler version.  If they held up better, I'd get a pair in every color."
3.0,order 2 sizes bigger
3.0,"I would give the dress 4 stars; however, it is way too large and the collar reminds me of a collar you would see a choir singer wearing.  I ordered a medium and I am 5'4, 120 lbs.  A small or extra small would have been a much better choice.  Also, I ordered the dress in white and it is extremely see-through.  I will have to go out and buy a slip to wear under it if I decide to keep it, which may end up costing me more than the dress is worth.  Very disappointing."
3.0,"This is a great polish, and the pink nude is a pretty color. Just a little too pinky than what I was looking for. I used it once and started looking again. It’s hard to render colors accurately on screen and even in the bottle a polish may look different. Having used it, I’d say it is a pinky/nude. Not a nude."
3.0,"I love the chains, beautiful design. The clamp chains broke the second time I wore them NOt very impressed."
3.0,Order just a size up and it will fit perfectly ... just a bit long tho but worth it
3.0,Top is ok. Skirt is very small
3.0,"I was so frustrated getting these to attach when I put them in - it was way too hard! Too bad, they looked like decent quality, but I couldn't get even one attached."
3.0,For a bit too long. And the material is a bit cheap
3.0,"Fit is a bit small, but I will still keep it. Tight around chest and waist."
3.0,"These are cute, however I ordered these thinking they where knee pads. These say they are kneepads but they are not. They are just cute leg warmers. They say unisex? really? I find these are more for a baby girl, not my grandson. I'll keep them just for him to play with in the house."
3.0,Remember those generic jerseys that you wore in gym class as a kid? These are pretty much the same thing.
3.0,"The picture is deceptive. The product is very short, did not come down to waist, more like an oversized bolero. Shoulders too wide for its size."
3.0,Very cute. Love the colors and material but way way too small
3.0,"I have a few different Gis, out of all my gts this one keeps shrinking and I never put it in the dryer! my others remain the same but not this one,it kept shrinking and I am disappointed since it is expensive."
3.0,The clip-on sun glasses have good lenses and are effective for a good price.  The clips that hold on to the lenses are short and can pop off with small adjustments to the glasses or the clip-ons.  The rubberized coating on those clips comes of very easily.
3.0,"Looks nothing like the picture, just OK."
3.0,"I am 5’-6”, 135lbs, 32D, 26”waist and 36” hips and I got a size medium.<br /><br />They are SUUUUPER long. Like I have to stand on my tippy toes to even get them a little off the ground. They fit really weirdly as well. There are some weird but seams and I think the waist goes up too high because it was about an inch away from touching my boobs. Their a really weird stretchy fabric so they aren’t loose around the hips/thighs at all. I probably won’t go through the hassle of returning them, but I would NOT recommend them to a friend."
3.0,"Too small and I tried to size up.  :( I ordered XL (16-18) and I am a US size 14 and 5'7"". They are too tight all through the legs and waist, plus they are about 4 inches too short for me. And guess what..... you can see underwear when bending over (eye roll)."
3.0,This thing does the trick it actually helps the pain stretch out just takes a little bit longer than one day you might need three days to stretch it out but then you have to alternate different positions
3.0,"I liked the suit, but sizing is an issue. I wear a 28 or 30 in an Arena tech suite, but this 34 in a practice suite was too small."
3.0,"I really liked this dress when I took it out of the bag. Unfortunately, once I put it on I realized the top is completely see through. The dress fits true to size but the fabric is just too thin."
3.0,"This product is NOT for brass, as stated on the description! It works fine on silver but not for brass."
3.0,"The construction is okay, its a tad bit on the flimsy side. The cups are not deep at all, this is not for busty women. Saying it runs small is an understatement"
3.0,Love the color and upper portion of the dress but was too long and looked weird at the bottom. If it was just cut a little shorter I believe it would have fit better and I would have kept it.
3.0,"Great hand & feel for fabric. However, the elastic quickly stretches out and the strap quickly become 2mm or more larger after just a few weeks."
3.0,Nice dark purple color with lighter weight fabric.  Zipper does not lay flat when partially zipped up.
3.0,I’ve had these before and they’re great..but these were intended for a pair of higher heels and no matter what I tried I couldn’t get them to work.  They just wouldn't adjust to the slope of the heel.  My previous ones did.  These are wider in the foot bed portion too. Probably wold work in flats..  Returned.
3.0,"I ordered a small, and found it too loose for what I was looking for, especially around the stomach/waist area.  I am 5'9, 160."
3.0,The cuffs are not sewn smoothly. It sticks out on at the seams. It’s tight at the calf but loose on the thigh.  Very deep pockets. They go down to mid thigh. Thick and ruffle looking waste band.  Material is not thin. Good thickness.  The crotch area is doubled sewn so it’s very sturdy in that area.  I’m still keeping it to wear around the house and run errands.
3.0,Fairly comfortable except for the arch.  Hoping that it will break in as time goes by.
3.0,I wear a women's size 16-18 in pants and found these pants to be too small in an XL and the fabric to be too thin.
3.0,"It wasn't what I expected.  The fit was a bit weird on me.  It is still a cute shirt, I just didn't feel like it fit me like the model on the picture....but then again, when does that EVER happen anyway?!  Ugh"
3.0,"I believed the bag to be a strong one for the amount of books my daughter had to carry, however within a couple months of use the trolley portion of it broke forcing my to have my daughter use as a book bag only.<br />After a few more months the linings inside of the bag begun to tear<br /><br />Not very happy with this acquisition"
3.0,"Cute bag, sturdy, canvas. Took it on vacation and wore it every day. A great workhorse bag, loved the comfy cross body strap. Only bummer is that the zipper broke right away."
3.0,I ordered a 7 and it fits like a 6. The stone looks fake and is very small but the band is pretty.
3.0,Bottom is quite small and top is large.
3.0,The foam padding around the inside of the glasses cover about half of the magnifying section of the glasses. I found them limiting for my use in the workshop. They also fogged up immediately when used with a 3M 6100 respirator.
3.0,like the material and the length.
3.0,"I ordered this dress previously and the pattern was incorrect.  I didn't pay attention to the fact as the dress was pretty and fit well.  I realized the pattern was incorrect and re-ordered another pattern and what I believed to be the original pattern. (I hadn't saved the bag) based on the original picture.  The second dress was fine, but I still didn't get the original pattern I wanted (PAT4).  It was the same pattern I received the first time.  The bag was marked with the wrong pattern number based on the product information on Amazon.  I had to return it.  Shame, as I really like the fit and style."
3.0,Buttons felll off after a couple of months.
3.0,I felt this is costly for 2 Rakhis and also received late.  Quality wise it is okay but but I was expecting something different based on the images
3.0,The size was perfect but the color wasn't the white I wanted I got more of a cream colored white
3.0,These are beautiful and pretty good quality.  My only issue was that they come in different sizes so not all fit me.
3.0,The sweater appeared to be well sewn and felt really good but the size was HUGE! I could have put almost 2 of me in it. I had to send it back and didn't order another one because I didn't know which size to order.
3.0,While I like this bracelet I have one very difficult time with the clasp. Trying to put this item on or off is a challenge so I don't wear it too often.
3.0,"When you get a promotion to review a  Christmas gift you bought for someone else and it is in a wrapped box somewhere awaiting the holiday, how can you resist responding to a promo asking for an honest review in exchange for $3.  This is the most honest review I can give and explains the 3 stars, cause, who knows?  It fits the box just fine and looked nice in the bag before wrapping.  I have high hopes that it will be perfect, but alas, I can not lie.  So, doing my best here.  Sadly, I know this helps no one.  Take care!!!"
3.0,"Nice fabric, good construction. Way too much/too tight elastic in the hem. It slides up my hips to my waist, making the whole thing balloon out. I’m in the process of carefully removing the elastic and will replace it with a grippy elastic that isn’t pulled so tight."
3.0,just o k
3.0,"It's a good cheap suit. It fits well, and looks good on. Only thing is the top is kind of hard to get perfect, and I wish it came already connected in the back."
3.0,Not as nice in the pucture. It is not even cute. Waste of money.
3.0,"They’re the right size but not nearly as pink as the picture. And since that’s what I bought them for in the first place, I’m kinda bummed out. Still cute for the price so I’ll find things to wear them with."
3.0,"Great price but a lot of my top barbells have broken, they crack in half and many times fall Now I have a lot of mismatch bellyrings."
3.0,This product has great potential if a little more care was taken into consideration
3.0,"Ordered Large and they’re a little snug. Definitely runs small, but long in length."
3.0,"I love the lace, it is not tight enough or it's the material that slides down onto my tummy."
3.0,"One of the lens slightly separated from the frame and leaves a gap and it does not snap back in place.  With this type of glasses, it is not unusual for the lens to separate from the from since I have a couple of sunglasses with this type of lens/frame design but it is usually easy to push it in back in place."
3.0,"A little large and clunky but that's the size you need for the step counter. It seems to record steps fine, though. Works good if you don't want to wear the bracelet. Cheap but seems to hold up well. You wouldn't want it to catch on something or break and lose your $110 step counter. Use card wearing it."
3.0,I love wellwits. it's usually great for the money but the first time I use the zipper before I even put it on my body the zipper broke....super annoyed
3.0,This was my second time ordering these lights. we use them when camping. Put them on the tires of the kids bikes and we can always spot them out of the crowd.<br />The last time we ordered i did not check all the lights but felt like alot did not work. This order I took them all out and checked them. Over 10 did not work. i mean i know it was a cheap price to begin with for 40 lights.... just sayin.
3.0,I never received the pretty drawstring bag that was supposed to come with the bracelet.
3.0,"I liked this, but had to return it due to running really small."
3.0,"It wasn't made that well, but it was cute."
3.0,I bought these as a last-minute birthday gift so they fit the cause I suppose however for the price they are not worth it. Very thin and cheap. Can bend them with a light touch
3.0,I like the space that this rolling backpack  has however it does holds up when it sits on the floor. I have to make sure that it is leaning against something to avoid it from falling foward. It should be fine if the items that you put inside are not too heavy.
3.0,hard to pull on as it was tight in the ankle area.
3.0,"It fit perfectly! But the material on the bodice was thinner than I expected, and because the skirt was heavier material, it was too heavy for the top of the dress, pulling on the thinner material.<br />If the thickness of the material had matched, I would have given 5⭐️ And the dress would’ve been perfect!<br />Ps, LOVE the pockets!"
3.0,The short was so tight and I ordered xl. When I usually wear medium.
3.0,It's a really nice floral shirt and the size fit will.
3.0,First zipper broke within 3 months. Second zipper broke at about 6 months.
3.0,Pretty and bright! The ring is VERY light weight though.
3.0,"Wanted it darker and it was a lil tight when I first put it on , I guess I gotta big head"
3.0,"This top is lightweight and comfy, but don't be fooled by the pic. It has the same coverage of a sports bra, seriously. The model in the pic either has a different top or a micro torso."
3.0,This worked for our costume accessory.
3.0,"Darling dress, but was way too small.  I am a size 10/12 with a large bust.  I ordered a &#34;large&#34; based on the size chart, but I couldn't even get it to zip all the way up.  Sadly, it is going back."
3.0,Super comfy and stretchy but were a little too tight for me to wear them to work. Closer to a leggings fit than a work pants.
3.0,So I think this shirt is super cute and fits great but the first time I washed it a snap came off. Luckily it was the snap at the collar so it didn't matter but this shirt is not super well made. Still cute and decent for the price. I don't regret buying it.
3.0,Second time I've bought this brand. Both ripped inside of a week of my teenage son wearing them. He said they're really comfortable but don't buy if you plan to was them because they bleed like crazy in the wash and they rip in no time.
3.0,Did not fit shoulders and tummy area very well.
3.0,Anklet was very pretty and perfect accent for me to wear to my sister's wedding but by the end of day my ankle had a green line all around it. So it was good for that one event but not something I will wear again.
3.0,Print started to flake off after 1st wash
3.0,"They look exactly as pictured and came in a nice little velvet bag. My only issue is that the stems (back of the earring that goes in the ear) were bent due to shipping. I was able to bend them back into place, but the metal is a bit flimsy so I worried about the stems snapping off altogether. As the earrings are in a bag instead of a box, they can easily be damaged or bent when shipped with other items. Other than that, we are happy with them and our daughter will love them."
3.0,"Keeps everthing organized.  However, it was too small for my purse, so I don’t really use it."
3.0,"I love oversized sweaters and cardigans, and this green color as well, but sadly this one didn’t work out for me. The color and stitching are pretty but it was much too large for me to hold any sort of shape or silhouette. Also, the fabric is quite itchy and uncomfortable. This is one of those clothes that I wish I could really like but I don’t. It’s so big for me that I don’t get those pretty crinkles near the wrists, and my fingers only reach an inch or two into the pockets when my arms are straight. Would recommend sizing down."
3.0,It's nice shirt but the fit was very small. If I moved the wrong way in this thing I would've ripped it in several places. Had to send back.
3.0,Beautiful skirt with vibrant colors! The skirt was just too large and would have cost me just as much to have it tailored.
3.0,"These help very little with headlight glare at night. They do make things look brighter at dusk.  I'm guessing they would also help in rain or fog, though we don't have much rain and no fog where I live."
3.0,"It's cute but way bigger than I thought,  I sent it back."
3.0,What you would expect from the price.  If you drop them once kiss them good bye
3.0,wasnt what I was looking for
3.0,This wallet is too small for my purpose.  It is well made but for someone who needs are ally small wallet.
3.0,Shame on manufacturer for being inconsistent with standard sizing.
3.0,nice product but ran on the small side. I niece never minds when things are small because she benefits from it.
3.0,Not as wide as I would have liked but other than that very attractive and relieved a lot of compliments on it
3.0,"It looks great and fits my larger frame, although tighter than is comfortable. Good quality."
3.0,Runs very very small!!! Still cute though.
3.0,It’s way too long. I had probably five inches taken off the bottom.
3.0,"The product itself is fantastic and well made. Just ran a bit smaller than would work for me. I had to return it. But if it were to fit correctly, it would be a great wardrobe addition!"
3.0,Looks the party but don't expect them to last to long
3.0,This item along with other items were too small. One item was correct size
3.0,Needle broke off the brooch the very first time trying to wear it.  Completely disappointed.
3.0,to  small  but the material is good I will give it to my daughter
3.0,"With the black rope provided, it was hard to keep secured in place. I think clear elastic bands that go around the ears would be so much better. My 4 year old somehow broke it in half as well, so I wouldn't say it is super sturdy. I was able to use epoxy and fix it."
3.0,"The colors look just as pictured and the bracelets all look great together. However, I just received and opened these today and one was completely broken and another had a charm that fell off."
3.0,Small! Be careful. Order up for sure!
3.0,Turned my finger green after a week.
3.0,I was hoping for a slipper with a little more structure
3.0,They are thick like training panties.  A 6 year old does not need panties that thick.
3.0,It fits on the small side. I should wear a large but I bought an extra large and it still is kind of small.
3.0,"The suit was beautiful, but, I wear a size 14 and I ordered the 14, and although the rest of the suit fit beautifully, the cups were about a B, and I wear a D. Would have loved to have this fit! Returned it."
3.0,Nice and comfortable but they run big and I wear with a belt and still have to constantly pull them up
3.0,Material is very heavy for summer.
3.0,"This product runs very small, almost like a junior size, so if you are big boned, order a larger size. Otherwise the style is adorable."
3.0,I am very pleased with my serenity bracelet and would recommend it.
3.0,It Breaks very easy.
3.0,"These run small based on the size chart. Also, I wished I had gotten the taller version because so much sand got in them."
3.0,Thank you finally got my package
3.0,small near shoulders and upper arms.
3.0,"This fit me decently well, but I could've gotten a large. I usually wear a small top and a medium bottom but the medium was too small."
3.0,"The body fits nice, but the sleeves are way too large width-wise (the length is good, though). I wouldn't mind the large arms if the body was a looser fit, but the inconsistency bothers me so I don't wear it out. However, it's super comfy and I love wearing it when I'm lounging around at home."
3.0,"Product is thin, stays cool, and fit well.  Don't know about wear attributes.  Also, description says, 5 pairs.  Only received 4 pairs.  This seems to be a recurring theme."
3.0,The zipper keeps getting stuck
3.0,"lil small for me, kinda sad."
3.0,Order M i normally wear S and it fits big for me but the material is very good
3.0,I like the design but it does not give you much support.
3.0,"Ok, the amount of glass provided is a bit cheezy (small) and there is a difference but i'm not sure its all that dramtatic"
3.0,It doesn't feel the same as the original wrist band
3.0,It’s very soft but it is not as slimming as the picture makes it look. I am a petite frame and I am “swimming” in it but the length of the arms fit well
3.0,Great but the light only lasts as long as you hold the button and the strap started peeling my skin
3.0,I.like the comfort but doesn't have as much support as I am used to.
3.0,"The waist is not fitted as shown. I am 5'3 and 160lbs, ordered a large, and to achieve the shown look I had to add a belt. The black doesn't end at my waist and more under the bust line. Not quite what I was hoping for but rather wear it then return it because I live rurally."
3.0,"While I love them from a comfort perspective, after 1 wearing (a 30 minute run) the stitching is coming apart (they haven't even been washed yet!). I have another pair of Nurse Mates compression sock and despite regular usage have not had this issue at all so I suspect this is a defective product. Hoping the seller will respond about a replacement as I'm doubtful I can do an amazon return with a worn product.."
3.0,"It has pretty colors but if you have any sort of bust it does NOT come down as far as it shows in the picture. It hit me right under my chest. If I ordered a larger size it would just be too big overall. If you are looking for a cropped sweater thats cropped high, you might like it.<br />I am returning it."
3.0,"Stitching was a little off and material stretched quite a bit when worn. I don't mind the snug fit. It's pretty short, but makes for a nice work out short or work with a high waisted black skirt or shorts. If you don't want too snug of a fit, consider going up one size."
3.0,"Even if you use their size chart, it still runs a little small."
3.0,"I need a bigger size, the size doesn't fit..your sizes must run small because I'm a size 6 normally but now I need a 6 1/2 or 7"
3.0,"I gave this 3 stars because I still think this is a lovely dress but if you have big boobs, be careful when you buy this. Make sure you look at the measurements before you buy. It's great for summer and it's a light fabric. Perfect for travel:)"
3.0,"I ended up returning this coat because the large, while probably the best size, was bulky on me and not the profile I was hoping for. Ended up with a medium of an older model off EBay. The medium looks great, although would be tight with a bulky sweater or sweatshirt so will probably wear in spring and fall. I'm a size 8-10. I get lots of compliments on the coat."
3.0,More of a tight fit than relaxed.
3.0,The belt smells horrid. It's been two weeks of airing out and it still has an odor. Other than that it's decent
3.0,"I bought these sunglasses for my 2.5 year old. She has a pretty big head and these are way too big...! We had the baby sunglasses and loved them, so these were disappointing."
3.0,I love the interchangeability!  I love the more professional look than the silicone bands!  I love the adjustable linked band - removed a couple of links and it fits very well!  I would like the mesh band even better if I could make it fit - it is too long and there is no shorter adjustment...
3.0,"This could have been an excellent product but it’s claim that one size fits all as not entirely true. The black model is very nice, especially with the gold seam. It’s easy to breath through, but it’s one problem is it’s placement on a larger face. It barely  reaches from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin, so it does not grip sufficiently. During normal conversation it will ride up the nose under the eyes,  and you will have to reposition it. Not satisfactory."
3.0,Cute looks like the pic but the soles look plastic not sure if that's safe for the snow and ice.
3.0,I adore this wallet! Sadly in the first week the lining came apart at the seam.
3.0,They are hard to get on and off so as far as I am concerned they are too small but they are great once you get them on. Now I am thinking about getting some regular bras and forget these.
3.0,i received the wrong size but it need up begin just fine. They fit better than original sized ordered
3.0,"For the money, you get what you paid for.  They're odd shape and either are super loose or choking you to death.  They're very cute but flimsily made-- the thick choker fell apart after 2nd use.  All 3 tend to open up and fall off while you're wearing them which is really annoying. But they did make for a cute accessory while they lasted.  I would shop somewhere else though."
3.0,"It's very stylish and nice, but it's a bit heavy."
3.0,"I like the earrings very very much, but I got them recently and I'm not sure how &#34;sterling silver&#34; of it is accurate!"
3.0,I couldn't figure out how to wear this thing no instructions were included
3.0,I would like the material to be a little thicker and form fitting. Does hold a lot .
3.0,"I thought it would feel and look nicer than it does. It looks cheap. I wouldn't buy it, knowing what I know."
3.0,Very small stone.
3.0,Tore up quickly
3.0,"This was a cute dress I gave away because although it fit great up top, I have big hips so it didn't close properly around that area. Left me totally exposed. I've ordered XL for similar items in the past because of my hips and haven't had an issue until now. It's a wrap dress. It should wrap. The person I gave it to had the same issue and she's considerably smaller than I am in the hip area. It was almost like there wasn't enough material."
3.0,The ears on the product are stuck in down position. They are a lot smaller than expected.
3.0,They are ok.  Definitely not mirrored.
3.0,"Was sort of pricey for the quality and weight of the product. They were actually too big for my face, so I gave them as a gift. The recipient loved them, if that matters."
3.0,Runs easy
3.0,Terrible fit. Not the best material
3.0,"With the expectation of a stainless steel signet at this price point my expectations were not very high for quality - but man oh man does this thing get scratched on anything and everything. I have multiple stainless steel rings and while they have accrued some dings and scratches over their lives none of them become littered in scratches after the first 2 days of wear. The top of this signet essentially has no minute spot that isn't covered in scratches.<br />Size was true to fit, and it does function as a ring."
3.0,"I like the shirt, but it fits a little funny."
3.0,Quality looked nice but was too large so had to return it.
3.0,"The shorts do run true to size for me, and the length is what I wanted.  That being said, the waistband elastic is not very strong (I wear them without using the drawstrings, as they are just for around the house), and the right drawstring keeps on retreating inside the material.  I won't be purchasing any more of these.  Reebok - do better."
3.0,The fabric was thicker than I expected and it doesn't look the same.
3.0,Purchase a size bigger. I'm a 00g and I purchased  00g but they always fall out.
3.0,"Dress is beautifully crafted, but runs small. Make sure that you plan accordingly when picking size. Otherwise, fabric and all other factors were stunning."
3.0,Nice looking if u switch out often or for events but not for daily wear. The color of metal changes n makes ur skin green.
3.0,RUNS A LITTLE SMALL
3.0,"This is a stark white nor at all cream like the picture. The lace is very fine/shear and does not look like much of a covering. It fits very lose and comes past my knees. There are not as many flower designs as the picture shows, they are really only around the bottom. Over all it isn't great but isn't horrible either. I recieved this product at a discount for my honest review."
3.0,The product was great just a lttle tight around the waist area.
3.0,To small order one size larger
3.0,These are nice but super small. I'm not sure they are worth what i paid for then.
3.0,I like the t-shirt.  Not fond of the material it is made of.
3.0,Dress is pretty but felt somewhat small and length was a bit long.  Was afraid it might shrink and become too tight so returned it.
3.0,I can’t seem to get Friday to work... but at least it looks good.  The overall frame is large... it looks too big on me.  For Halloween... this is the perfect prop.  But I don’t look like Tony Stark... maybe more as Tony Stank.
3.0,The bracelet has an extra broken link attached.  A quality control issue to be sure.  I have no tool to remove it and am afraid of damaging the bracelet trying with the wrong tools.  The extra broken link scratches my wrist or I would just leave it.  There was an email address to report problems and I sent a photo and email but there has been no response...
3.0,"Some of them are so small they barely fit my nose circumference wise, but they're cute and they don't irritate my nose."
3.0,Needs a stronger shock
3.0,Nothing to rave about.
3.0,I enjoyed the variety pack the fact that I can get more than one garment for one low price was excellent I wish they were thicker I have to wear a slip or leggings under me so I would like for them to have been thicker
3.0,"I am 5'5"" with a 34D. Top just didn't look right as the middle band instead of being under the boobs, near my waist, is actually right underneath my boobs. Looked strange. Not every top can look great. Will try others from Patty."
3.0,"Bought a large, it was tight. Not the fit I was expecting."
3.0,I bought three shirts expecting them to be cotton as advertised but all three are 100% polyester?
3.0,"Nice quality, but looks cuter in pic.  Has a less fitted look than pictured."
3.0,"MITILLY Women's Boho Floral Print 3/4 Sleeve V-Neck Casual Flowy Long Maxi Dress with Pockets<br /><br />This dress isn't what I expected. I thought it would be a lightweight and ""flowy"" dress as described, but the material is that of a thick t-shirt and is quite heavy. Add in the long length and the 3/4 sleeves and it doesn't really work well for warm summer weather. The print doesn't look as nice in person, very pastel pink and baby blue making it look like something a little girl would wear. The buttons are just sewn on the front, they're not functioning buttons. This reminds me of a night gown that would be worn in the 1800's or something. Although the fit is comfortable I seriously doubt that I would ever wear this out in public. I will most likely be donating it."
3.0,"Takes some time to get use to it, but they do the job and my glasses no longer fall off my face"
3.0,Decent hat. I gave it to my wife who says she'll wear it but hasn't yet. I just bought a Tilley...
3.0,"Update: This watch has begun to lose time after only a few weeks of wearing it. While I would still highly rate it based on its looks and friends comments, I've had to downgreade my assessment - a watch that won't keep time is not of much use.<br />My earlier review: I saw this watch as an Amazon Deal and thought it was cool looking so I bought it. As advertised, it is very light. I've also gotten a lot of positive comments from people. I think they 1st notice the 2 small wrist bands then come with it and then their attention is drawn to the watch itself. I just hope it lasts."
3.0,"Beautiful color and pattern, but very thin fabric and not generously sized at all. Had to return."
3.0,Nice necklace but of course when you zoom in they make the heart look larger than it really is. Was surprised that the heart was extremly tiny. Have to decide if I want to return or find a bigger heart that will cost me more money.
3.0,"Sometimes its hard ordering on line when you can't try some out before you purchase it. The quality and sound dampening are great. The ONLY problem I found was they just don't fit on my head very well. I'm at the extreme end of the extension of the ear pieces and they JUST make it over my ears. This makes it uncomfortable when moving my head to either side, it lifts up the ear piece just a little, allowing sound to come in. I wish they just had a little more extension to the length that the ear pieces can move.<br />Like some, I just hate returning items, not knowing if a different one will be the same type of fit?"
3.0,"These were a tighter fit than I expected. Just not what I was looking for in a pant with such heavy material.<br />The courdury was realy nice and seemed like it would have been warm. However, the pair I received didn't have a button hole, as some other reviews has said. It would have been ready to fix but I opted to send them back."
3.0,"They’re okay. Don’t hate them, don’t love them."
3.0,"The thickness from the material is very thin, I haven't worn it yet so I won't be able to tell if it lasts but from the looks of it I doubt it'll make it past a couple of weeks. Based on the price, It's overpriced for what it is. I should have checked the reviews before ordering it. I'll just give it 3 stars for the moment based on what I have."
3.0,Very pretty bit huge in the bust. I wear a DD and couldn't come close to filling it out! Going to try to have it taken in.
3.0,Going by size chart ordered but way too large and do not like way style looks .  Its much better in picture.  It looks matronly.  Sent back
3.0,"They’re ok, just nothing spectacular. Material is slightly on the cheap side. Returning."
3.0,Will be fine once I rig the skull to new wires as they came with connecting loops broken...to much work for something seller should have done. :(
3.0,This ring is pretty but looks nothing like the one I chose when I ordered. The one in the picture had more colors. It’s waaaay different.
3.0,"Pretty, but drew up TOO much when washed. My mom never wears over a medium, & she couldn't wear these after they shrunk."
3.0,Very cute. But very small. About 2 sizes smaller than what they should have been
3.0,"having a super difficult time popping it open, maybe because it's so small? But it's good quality"
3.0,Ok they started to turn black after two days of wearing ! You get what you pay!
3.0,"This item while it looks good is not made for large ears. The small securing piece doesn't function the way one might suspect unledd you like the dragon to be leaning away from your ear at a 45 degree angle. Some metal manipulation must be done. I have removed that small bracket from the piece and use just the dragons claws and tail to secure it on my ear. As is it is an ok piece but not one I will wear often. All in all it is what you pay for it is cheap, but will suffice for what I have in mind for it."
3.0,Belt was 42 inches really not a bad price but order your 2 inches larger than you need.
3.0,Battery didn’t last long at all
3.0,"I usually absolutely love Brooks sneakers but these are not great. The tongues ripped within the first two weeks of using them, which now requires some extra finesse to put them on. Other than that, they look nice and they do well during rigorous training"
3.0,Loved the style and look of this bathing suit. Unfortunately it runs very small.
3.0,Wow.. i ordered a small and it is like a dress on me. I like the design. But i look pregnant in it. So im thinking of hemming it some. Fabric is comfy.
3.0,"The hat construction, appearance and the material are all very nice and as they appear in advertising.<br />However, the back of the hat is “sized” by plastic round inserts as opposed to a preferred Velcro secured sizing so I would not buy another one."
3.0,"2X was more like a large. Didn't fit. The material and quality is good though, but I have no use for it."
3.0,"Thin material,  very wrinkled, but pretty!"
3.0,I am 5'7&#34; and this dress was way too short. Sent it back.
3.0,love these but one bag quickly split on a lower seam
3.0,"Okay, so I'm learning slowly but surely, not to buy clothes off amazon lol in the pic, it looks like these shorts conform to the model's small waist...such a lie! So I have a &#34;small waist&#34; too, kinda, 30 inch waist and 42 inch hip. And im 5'4&#34;. So of course I'm expecting these shorts to fit me exactly as they fit the model. Nope. Not only do the shorts not come down to the middle of my knee they way they look in the pic, but the waist was way too big. It fit on my butt and hips, but I had way too much room in the waist, so they were returned.<br /><br />Amazon, please depict clothing accurately! Curvy women search far and wide for items that will fit both their waist and hips perfectly, and I thought I found a match, until I tried them on. Tisk tisk."
3.0,I bought xl I'm size l/xl curvy woman. Suit fit good except little short in the torsos area.
3.0,"Great top, but it does NOT stayed rolled off the shoulders."
3.0,Ended up being a lot better looking/better material (actual jean but still stretchy) than what the picture seemed to be
3.0,"I just got it today, But it was a bit too small in the rear end department.(lol) I'm petite I could wear a 4- 6 but it's still kind of small for me.I love the material it's very light but it's a no go. I would like to order another, But afraid of it not working out  again. Oh I made my 12 yr. old daughter try the skirt on and it fit her perfectly! She's a size 2. Hope that helps."
3.0,"Cute idea and nice fabric, color and belt. But huge. Like, tent huge. Even on my pregnant self. Liked the idea but had to send back."
3.0,"I guess I didn't realize this tied in the back. Because of that, you can't really wear a cardigan with it. I returned this because it fit really...thick in the waist. It made me look like I had no waist. I expected a different fall and fit to it. The material is great and the colors are accurate to the pic."
3.0,"I got the pink set. The picture shows black stripes but mine have pink stripes, which is ok. I am 4’11 1/2”, 126-129 lbs. Bought a medium, the shorts are very snug in the waist but ok in the hips. The top is a little tight around the hips. I could have worn a large, which I have never bought in pajamas. I usually wear a medium on the bottom and am between small and medium on top, depending on how long it is. I already wore them, so I’m keeping them. Hopefully the waist will stretch after wearing awhile. Since the waist is so tight they’re ok for average temperatures but not great for hot nights. If you’re between sizes I would go up an extra size."
3.0,Colors not as bright as picture shows. Pretty hard to read time and date. Not one of my favorites. It's a G so I'm gonna keep it anyway.
3.0,Fits good under wire digs in my side
3.0,"no fit here.  dumb question.  work as expected.  Great for arthritic hands, except in putting them in the shoes in the first place.  that's hard"
3.0,I sincerely thought this was made with a thicker fabric....It's actually  rather thin and summer like<br />But pretty.
3.0,"I wear a 16/xl but purchased this coat in a 1x since it was junior sized. While the arm length was good, the body of the coat was boxy and wide. I feel sizing down to an xl would only shorten the length/sleeves but do nothing the fit of the body. The coat is nice looking and well made, just awkwardly proportioned."
3.0,"Did the trick, nothing special or wrong."
3.0,Runs big gave to daughter
3.0,Second time I ordered rhine stones kept falling out.
3.0,Great fit and feel… But the camouflage design is a little funky and not at all like the traditional camouflage you see in the photo.
3.0,"Pro's: Great heel size, comfortable boot, zip up for easy on/off, true to size.<br /><br />Con's:  Can tell its not genuine leather but for the price, that's ok.  The pictures make the lightest boot look like a Winter White and it is definately more of a camel color!!  I was slightly disappointed because I needed the other shade but will keep the boots."
3.0,the watch is great for a dino lover - the strap is a little bulky - i will probably change that out
3.0,"What happened to Hika great dresses???<br />I bough last year five those dresses in difrent colors. I love them. They wash great , no fade on color/ hang to dry/, no shrink, no piling.<br />Decided to buy more . I order 3 colors, and 😩😂that’s not the same .<br />Black is SOO thin I have to return. Dark green is a little thicker fabric so I will keep for fall season.<br />I will try to order blue because I acidently demage  the old one , I hope is not so thin fabric like black<br />Hika please keep your product in high quality,<br />That is important."
3.0,Very small difficult to see then on
3.0,I bought this for my 10 year old boy and ended up giving it to my 12 year old daughter instead.  The colors were definitely more on the purple and pink side than blue and red.  It's still a pretty cool hoodie though.
3.0,"I bought this bracelet for endometriosis awareness month. Its hard to put on by yourself and started to go brassy after a few weeks of wear. The ribbon also popped off, no idea where it went."
3.0,Upon delivery there was already a hole in the crotch that I had to fix myself
3.0,Like the hat! but it's a little tight on my head!
3.0,Not worth my money
3.0,I like the shorts.  I don't like the tankini though...the way the lace sticks out makes it look like maternity top.  Makes you look way fatter.  I kept the shorts and use it with another top and that looks great.
3.0,It hurts my ribs and special when I sit down. Other than that I am happy with the purchase.
3.0,I'm 5'3 and ordered a medium; it doesn't even touch the ground! Bummer.
3.0,the straps to the dress were sew down in the wrong spots so it doesn't make that design in the back other than that the dress does look like the picture straps were n wrong position
3.0,The length on it is very nice. The review sais that you can cut it shorter but I would not recomend doing that as the stem is a hard plastic and there is really no way to make the ball stay on after its cut.
3.0,"Bought a medium for my husband who is 5'10"" and 170lbs<br />It didn't fit him so it's mine now and it's tight on me. 5'3"" 130lbs"
3.0,Nice for first dates worth the price.
3.0,"These fit snugly around the entire eye area. The problem is that they dug into my face causing discomfort and painful divots everywhere they hugged my face within just a few minutes of trying them on. Loosening the head strap didn’t alleviate the discomfort and simply caused the googles to move around on my head while swimming. I was so disappointed that they were so uncomfortable because they really nicely encased my eye areas. The head strap was however awkward to fasten and adjust because of the closure mechanism.<br />Sadly I returned this item. Lastly, the case which came with the googles was top notch though tricky to open and close."
3.0,I am a big girl so I ordered a size bigger than I would ware they are not so tight. But I like them
3.0,"These are ok, but they are really large once you get them.  They were to big for me but other than that they were very sparkly!!"
3.0,"Lenses pop out too easily, in fact one wasn’t in the frame and I had to put it in."
3.0,"When I received the canvas backpack in the mail, and it exactly as described.  There were a few loose strings, but they were not an issue; they pulled out with loosening any of the stitching.  Great appearance and quality.<br /><br />I transferred all of my contents from my current purse/backpack to use the following day before traveling cross country.  While in the airport, the pack did not provide easy access when pulling out my wallet and finding other items.  Just after one plane trip and while changing flights, BOTH hooks that attach the strap broke, and I had to purchase a luggage strap at the airport so I could carry the bag on my shoulder through my trip.  Very disappointed in that."
3.0,"String is thin and shorter than a regular lanyard. The personalized piece is smaller than photographs show. Almost too small to even read. Pretty, but little and less sturdier than I thought it would be."
3.0,Great price for 4 pairs.  They are nice to look at but a little distorted towards the bottom of the lenses.  Wasn't expecting perfection for the price but it's always nice to be surprised.
3.0,Didn’t fit well…also small for respective size..
3.0,Eh. Didn’t like the material
3.0,This ring is my birth stone . I have wanted a birth  stone ring can't wait to get  it.
3.0,"I was looking for a grocery bag that I could wash and be fun at the same time and who doesn't love Smokey. It's really a cool bag but it's not for grocery shopping, it doesn't stand up.  I watched the bagger at the grocery store struggle with this bag and then I bagged myself and struggled with it as well."
3.0,they run a bit small though
3.0,[[VIDEOID:3565a7cc3c3bcd6b9656fb65be85b1f2]]
3.0,Underwire is fine but the actual coverage size not great. Better design to hold larger breasts is a must.
3.0,"I wish the top two straps, that attach to the shirt, were longer and had length adjustments, which would allow me to attach the clips next to the front pleat and next to the two outer back pleats on a uniform shirt, or to fold over back pleat to keep the back in but also tight from side to side,which his far less expensive then getting the shirts tailored"
3.0,"I love BluBlocker sunglasses.  I have owned a bunch of them.  My biggest gripe is mostly my fault.  I tend to break them.  The good news is they aren't that expensive.  This is the first time I have tried this model.  While the lens do everything they say they will, it is the overall size which is the problem.  They are HUGE and heavy.  Unless you wear a cord to hold on your glasses you will forever be pushing these back up on your nose or losing them.  My recommendation is to go rimless.  Also, attention Blublocker!  Please bring back your Medium size clip-ons.  They were perfect.  The small ones are a bit pretentious for us guys and the big ones are a bit Elton John."
3.0,"I like this dress. However, you are going to have to pin the breast area and it’s rather short. Does not wash well."
3.0,"I bought these because I’m pregnant and expect my feet to widen. But, they’re way too loose right now. They’ve stretched also. Cheaply made. Material is peeling off of them already. I’ve warn them 3 times."
3.0,"I sized up, as many of the other reviews warned me to do, and the top fit perfectly, I was very happy with it. However, the bottom was WAY too large, there's no way I will be able to wear it. this is quite unfortunate, but for the price, I guess that's okay. I am about 5 foot 5, I weigh around 130 pounds and I am a 32 B bra. I ordered the medium."
3.0,My girls love the way it design.
3.0,Cute buy verry small. I am a 12 ordered a XL and it was still probably 2 sizes too big
3.0,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTD8GQ2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11
3.0,a lovely simple dress to wear in the summer
3.0,"The outfit itself is super cute and fit my daughter perfectly, however i cannot give 5 stars due to the fact that when we received it the letters were peeling off of the shirt, I had to take my iron and iron them down or they would have torn off completely."
3.0,"This is cute, but a summer time wear. Once sweater weather hit I was snagging it on all my clothes. I have it and will use it again when the weather permits."
3.0,It’s cute but not practical. The stones make it heavy and it’s hard to breath through it. Oh well. Back to paper masks.
3.0,"This suit is so gorgeous I really wish it would fit! I bought the largest one they make and it was way too short and way too small for this 5'8, size 22 bod. Sorry tall folks. Don't try this one!"
3.0,"Nice design, quality material but 3x didn’t fit my husband. Runs really small."
3.0,"These are nice and soft pajamas. However, they don't last very long. My son  started getting holes in it after a month or so. Not a big deal since he outgrows his pajamas pretty often, just an FYI in case you are looking for long lasting pajamas."
3.0,It is small..  order a few sizes up
3.0,"It's ok, I bought it cause it was over sized."
3.0,"Beautiful bracelets. My only criticism is that in a set, the green bracelet arrived broken. I wish to have the complete set."
3.0,"They work great, but they don’t send everything in all the sizes. Missing silicone pieces in some of them, and noticed the sizes might be off in some of the bags too"
3.0,Looks great but very uncomfortable. Not good if you're gonna be walking around a lot. The sole is hard and I got pains in my ankle from walking around the mall.
3.0,Kinda cheap but they did the job for the costume party
3.0,Kind of disappointed.
3.0,They are okay for the price.
3.0,band is tearing just days after getting it
3.0,Large runs small just don't have the time to return for larger size
3.0,"I actually love the fabric and it's nice and cool for hot summer days.  It's not as long as the picture depicts, but it's okay.  Fits small.  Ordered a size larger than I usually would, but it was still a little snugger than would prefer.  Two main reasons for only 3 stars: took SO LONG to ship from China (3 weeks from time order was placed), and there are permanent wrinkles across the back and across the front that don't come out in wash.  I haven't used an iron in years, so not sure if they will iron out."
3.0,"My entire family made fun of me when I wore these glasses. They are bigger then they look or maybe I have a small face, I don't know, but I was ridiculed so much over the holidays that now I don't want to wear them. Sigh...because they help me see! Jerks!"
3.0,"It looked great when it came in, however I ordered red and it came in maroon. I ordered it Bc I had a matching outfit for another child therefore I had to get another one made"
3.0,"Good size, somewhat stiff, does not open very wide, could use some outside pockets."
3.0,I wish they had blacked out lens.
3.0,"Good product, like the picture. But, instead of the girls necklace saying “got true love” it says “gol love love”. Disappointed in the making"
3.0,"Overall I really liked the product. I am a fan of the lighter weight of modal, and wanted to try a brief but not at the prices of the major brands (lookin at you Calvin). The material quality of these was as expected for the price, decent, but not perfect. The mesh front sort of takes away from the ultra light feel of modal underwear, but it can be lived with.<br /><br />My major complaint comes with the size of the pouch. It’s really not all that generous, especially toward bottom as it wraps around underneath. As such, for the gentlemen with larger jewels, be advised that these may not fit well for you. The waist also has a tendency to roll up, which I thought most underwear brands had figured out by now.<br /><br />I caught these on sale, so I’m not devastated, but had I paid full price I likely would’ve been on the disappointed side. Decent product, but it doesn’t necessarily blow me away with those few problems."
3.0,Did the job but very flimsy
3.0,I usually wear a 14/16 so I got an XL and it fits bigger than I expected. The slip under the dress is very short/small so it barely covers my behind and since the dress is sheer I wouldn't be able to wear it unless I work shorts something underneath.
3.0,"These shoes, with springs in the heels, are very comfortable! My husband has recurring plantar fasciitis and these shoes help him a lot. The only downside is that the springs set off metal detectors at security check points and after awhile, the springs begin to squeak."
3.0,The blouse runs a bit large and the material wrinkles very easily. It is alright for the price.
3.0,"Way too small. Ordered 2XL, fits like a large. China BS."
3.0,The color is spot on but after a few days it peels off pretty easy.  You will need to put a strong base and over coat for it to last a week without chipping.
3.0,Had this for little over a month and the only problem is that it stitch keep coming off.
3.0,"Pros<br />The items look absolutely adorable.<br />The stocking fits well.<br /><br />Con(s)<br />The product says &#34;Black Lace thigh highs&#34;<br />not &#34;Black Lace KNEE highs&#34;.<br />The product looks like one big sock.<br />It does not go to my thigh and only stays on my knee.<br />The photos gave me the impression it went up higher.<br />If you take a good look at them, you will see what I am talking about.<br />I wanted it to come up higher not look like a designer sock."
3.0,This feel amazing but they fit adults not kids. Maybe teenagers could wear them.
3.0,Nice for its price
3.0,I was disappointed that the colors were not as shown.  I received 2 pink and two beige and no black or white.
3.0,First off this is a very nice watch strap. My only issue with it was when it was delivered one of the clasps that inserts into the Apple Watch itself was on backwards. It would not clip in and kept sliding out. Fortunately for me I have some knowledge about watches and used my watch repair tools to flip it over to the correct side. For what they charge for the strap this should not happen. Most people would have had to return it.
3.0,"Cute little socks but the bows are barely sewn on.  They will not last through 1 wear, sadly.  They still look cute without bows though"
3.0,"The photos lead you to believe these are a bright pink, they are not. They are pale pink."
3.0,I received my package as stated haven’t worn it yet but it like will leave another review with pictures when I do wear it
3.0,Many too small and many too large
3.0,Cute but runs small! Order at least one size up.
3.0,"They are really cute but they have a pretty bad glare. Also, they easily got scratched up."
3.0,Good bench for incline and decline presses. Comfy when you have heavy weight loads. The seat section isn't flush when laid flat so  there is a bump sticking up when flat. Adjusting with the pin is kinda a pain but is solid so the adjusted set won't slip or fall. It's good enough to work on for the price.
3.0,Good product with new design
3.0,All different sizes and shapes.
3.0,"I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh 130 pounds. The skirt is actually pretty big, and flares out way more than I thought it would. I haven't found a top that goes with it yet, so I haven't worn it in public."
3.0,I’m not too happy with the item... but I’m sure I’ll find a way to apply it to my wardrobe. Dress seems shorter than advertised.. mid thigh
3.0,"Color is not as yellow gold like it is in the photo. The actual color has a very slight greenish tinge to it. I wanted pure gold like in the photo, but the material is nice so I will keep this."
3.0,"Nice watch. I enjoy the clasp over older cheaper watches from this brand. Sold without the tool to set the band. Not entirely expecting it, but “instructions” is just  the process of sizing by removing pins and links, which would happen in a typical brick and mortar. Hit one if those, or buy the cheap kits here on Amazon."
3.0,Very good item but it came defective.  As soon as I opened it I realized that it did not sound also that there was something loose inside.
3.0,Wasn't what I was hoping for..nice bra for the price just made a little small
3.0,"I love the fit and style but the fabric feels a bit itchy when you first put it on. It feels similar to nylon on the skin, which I happen to dislike. After an hour or so of wearing it though the feeling disappears."
3.0,The boxer legs are a little too long.
3.0,"The fit is fine, they are long enough, lined and not see through but the waistband is thin and cuts and the buttons are the cheapest plastic ever.<br />The strong smell of dead fish is overwhelming and I literally had to put through the was 5 times before the smell dissipated. I also cut off the buttons. The only reason I kept them was because they were so cheap. Wouldn’t be worth returning. I am glad I persevered though. Think they are (finally) going to be wearable for the fall"
3.0,Cute but the strap is twisted
3.0,"This shirt looks much better on the picture then it does in person. In real life this is just a regular, but loner, T-shirt. Printing is also not as atractive as on the pic. I not am retruning this item but I am NOT impressed at all"
3.0,Iron on is low quality.  It won’t last long.
3.0,I can wear anywhere from a medium to a large. I ordered the XL based on other reviews and the sizing chart. My chest is the area that I have to be concerned about. The XL was a great fit. Anything else would have been too tight across the chest. It looks like the picture but it's cheaply made. Looks like a DIY project. But it's still not too bad for the price. I'm hoping that once I dress it up and throw on some accessories it will look better.
3.0,Again not real pearls but can gift to someone
3.0,"Marked up: price, comfort, decent quality.<br />Marked down: design, logo."
3.0,it fits really small so don't order if you have a medium or big wrist.
3.0,"Great Google's love the little rubber rim wish it was more durable.<br /><br />after 2 years: lasted pretty good with use around 4 times a year, detraction part started to get noticeably scratched and the rubber part completely broke of on 1 eye. other than that and a 20$ hike great product"
3.0,Too stretchy. XL fits like medium
3.0,"I’m about 115lbs (5ft) and the small worked perfectly for me. The color was great, the material was good, I was very happy with it UNTIL...I took it off and saw that the pink dye stained my body. My underarms looked the worse. It took a few showers to wash that dye out of my skin. I’m worried about it. I should have tried hand washing this before I threw it on for my costume. But I was afraid it would be messed up.<br /><br />In terms of shipping, it got to me a lot faster than expected. I think it took about two weeks."
3.0,I loved the look but hated the fabric.  Back it went which left me disappointed.
3.0,"I bought this to use for work. I loved it at first, but the strap broke after a couple months. It tore where the stitching is at the top of the bag."
3.0,"Great fit and love the length. My only issue is after  first day at beach, the grommets left a rust like stain on these swim trunks."
3.0,"Nice fit and very warm for hiking. But  as some of the other reviews have stated, this jacket is of substandard quality and prone to ripping in the armpit and the zipper is hardly that."
3.0,"The fit was decent, but just way too long."
3.0,"The straps are VERY thin & lightweight, the handle isn't big enough, and the zipper doesn't work well. But it is very well insulated, holds a lot, and the inside is pretty rugged."
3.0,"Very nice, very pretty, great price.<br /><br />Unfortunately, mine was in two pieces when it came.<br /><br />I can probably fix it but this shouldn't have happened until it was at least worn once, not freshly opened out of the box."
3.0,The top rounded edge is a bit more rounded then the picture displays
3.0,"The shirt is fine for the price, however, the photo is misleading.  The photo of the shirt appears to be black with ""white"" leaves, however, the leaves are actually a tan/khaki color.  Disappointed, as I needed black and WHITE for costume.  Another Amazon return."
3.0,"I ordered these thinking they were going to be a thicker size and despite being costume jewelry, pics looked as though it would be quality. The metal is cheap quality, very thin and not worth the $14 price tag. These feel very cheap and while I’m okay with the style, the actual<br />Piece is not worth the price. Seller was very quick with shipping."
3.0,Quality isn't the greatest. Good for warmer days because it's on the thinner side. But other than that super cute.
3.0,"Wanted a delicate chain, no it's a big chain and looks cheap"
3.0,The quality is good but I would size down. The socks they came with was an adult size so my 7 year old can’t use them.
3.0,"My son likes these shoes, says they are comfortable for running. The only issue is the water resistance. The rubber bottom half is definitely water resistant, but after running through wet grass, water seeped through the top part of shoes and his feet became damp"
3.0,Bought it for the price. Bottom fits well never used the top. Top is bulky but didn't expect anything better for that price.
3.0,I love this ring. It is exactly  as pictured. It is well made as well. Just do have in water often as coating will come off.
3.0,"These are pretty earrings, but the studs are pretty lightweight.  They came just loose in the box although there was a piece of foam with slits the earrings should have been paced into.  The studs were a little bent but I was able to straighten them.  Poor quality control.  I was disappointed with these issues but didn't have time to return the earrings as they were gifts for Christmas.  My granddaughter liked them so that pleases me.  I hope they hold up with wear."
3.0,"These socks do keep my feet warm when I am not walking around; however, they do not seem to work as well on my tile and laminate floors. That being said, I wear them to bed almost every night and I was able to make cat toys out of the pompoms and string. :)"
3.0,Should have ordered a medium.  This shirt runs big.  I’m usually a large. I’m 5’3 165 lbs 36D bra and it was big.
3.0,So cute.....just too little
3.0,"I have hammer toes and my toe joint likes the shoe, but the toe box is shaped funny and my toe rubs on the top of the shoe."
3.0,"I purchased these as a stocking stuffer.  The earrings are wonderful, but the earring backs provided did not fit.  Not in any way, shape, or form.  I had to fish around through my earrings to find a pair of backs that fit.  I ended up using a rubber back for both.  I keep a pack to put on my french wires (prevents one from losing earrings that ride up on sweaters and such).  Again, the earrings are lovely, but I am not pleased that no proper fitting back was provided with these post earrings."
3.0,"I bought this product for Crossfit training. The sizing is a bit off; fits a little larger than expected.  Im a medium and after trying the product I wish I would have purchased a small.  The item does not feel snug on my legs like other brands. I own Nikes and Old Navy ones, and both fit great in size medium."
3.0,Cute top but the short side is a tiny bit too short.  And I am not a tall person!  It would be super cute if it was just a bit larger so it was more &#34;flowy&#34;.
3.0,"they are nice, but i take a small (29 inch waist) and the large is pretty snug. i am a bit disappointed with the chinese sizing system, as it is always difficult to choose the correct size."
3.0,Still very comfortable but a little longer than I would have expected.
3.0,"I LOVED the way this looked when it arrived.  However, after wearing it only a couple of times, the sun fell off and I lost it.  Wish it was made better because it is beautiful.  But for the price, I can find something else equally beautiful that is better made.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZIYI60O/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_20"
3.0,Thought this would cover more in the front. I ordered an xl and still small. I’m a medium/large .. it’s pretty beside that
3.0,Ok but kinda itchy
3.0,These were much bigger than &#34;normal&#34; size
3.0,Cute but material is really thin. I had planned to wear to work but it's more fit for a summer day out on the town.
3.0,Pretty. I had to clean them because they were very dirty when I received them. It seems as if the earring posts are not gold and were soddered on weird
3.0,It's a little big for smaller people. I also can't tell how it's 'Quick Dry' yet.
3.0,Somewhat dull.
3.0,"The product itself is nice but only has one pin stud in back instead of two, wiggles around and doesnt stay still where ever placed"
3.0,Small does not runtime to size. You have to steam
3.0,"RL quality has lost its touch. In years past I could pick up a specific size & knew it would fit me like a glove! Not anymore, now the sizing is horrible & I cannot judge whether I’m going to fit in the same size I bought previously within the last month of the same item!"
3.0,Too large - gave to some one else.
3.0,def fit way small. had to go up like 2-3 sizes!
3.0,"The earrings look like the picture however, the color was totally off. I expected them to be navy blue but they were like a deep turquoise"
3.0,Fits nice but tall
3.0,"I have narrow feet, so this shoe is quite wide on me.  I’m also a half size, so I went up to the next full size, but I should have gone down.  Basically, these are clown shoes on me - but they’re comfy!  Also, the arch support is just OK.  I expected more."
3.0,"Nice belt but feels, looks and smells like plastic. Not stamped genuine leather. Not convinced that it is so sending it back. If it doesn’t bother you for quality of wear, May be ok purchase."
3.0,I love the dress but the chest part is too big on me and the underarm hole is thight. I still going to keep it and maybe do some alteration.
3.0,"When I ordered this I knew maybe it was going to run small even though it said &#34;plus size&#34;. It took only three days for it to ship but it took almost two weeks to get because they had messed up on my address three times. When it finally arrived i tried it in of course and tried to button it, the bust area was the hardest because I have a huge bust; the sleeves are a bit tight especially when you wear more than one shirt. Yesterday one of my buttons did pop off but it wasn't fastened ( the holes for the buttons I did have to cut a little for the buttons to fit). Don't get me wrong the coat looks pretty awesome to me even with one button missing I mean how hard is it to just sew it back on. Overall all I can say if I got the 4X it would have fit more but I can't stop wearing it. Hopefully this review helps ."
3.0,Has a black mark right in front (looks like ink) so I will have to return. 🙁
3.0,I thought it has a front opening.
3.0,"The top was nice fabric, nice style. But I was mislead by the size chart, so ordered way too large. Fix that size chart!!"
3.0,"The picture makes it look like it has a thick and wide neck, it's not. It's a regular, crew-cut neck. The picture makes it looks like it has a loose fitting fabric. It's not, it's just a regular unisex t-shirt that has been cut. Cute, just not exactly what I expected."
3.0,"Don't stay down well. Even when tucked in, will still ride/roll up."
3.0,My feet slide in them.....skinny feet
3.0,I had to return it. My Stuhrling watch was too big and kept bumping the lid.  If it was just a little bit bigger it would have worked for me.
3.0,"The dress is nice but it doesn't fully wrap. If i sit, the dress opens up revealing a slip or shorts."
3.0,"Overall I like the material. But it’s poorly manufactured, you can see the cuts made on the sleeve and this product runs large with the size varying across the whole shirt."
3.0,The material isn’t very comfortable and it’s kind of boxey …. was for me anyway
3.0,Runs small. Looks cool
3.0,Cheap chain but I love my moon! I ware with another moon necklace I purchased and get loads of compliments.
3.0,"These stop two inches below my knee.  I have a 33 inch inseam, so I'm a little on the tall side.  They do fit my size 9.5 feet just fine, and the material they are made from is comfortable, but because they stop short of my knee, they slide down and have to be pulled up every few minutes, and don't provide any support."
3.0,I wish there was a lining underneath this dress. The material is too cheapy. The only thing done right is the style n sizing but not worth keeping
3.0,Didn't like the. Wrinkle material.
3.0,"It cleans the shoes, but it’s nothing revolutionary. Any household methods does the job just as well"
3.0,"Cheaply made, scrunching on butt looks awkward. Waist too big"
3.0,"I am very tall and was looking for tanks that wouldn't ride up but that wouldn't be uncomfortably long. These are LONG, too long for my needs. If you are looking for a long tank that will cover your backside these are for you. I do wear them sometimes with leggings just for that reason, but that wasn't what my intention was."
3.0,It’s a really nice belt. But it’s just too heavy and deluxe for my son’s little five year old body to manage at the moment.
3.0,It cute but it not soft at all.
3.0,they are not bad for the money - lenses are clear and not milky like some but have some warping at the top edge
3.0,"It came with an amazing case and lens cleaner, but the shades do not properly close. Still wearable. I'm just afraid if i open and shut them too much they will bend or break."
3.0,"Brought this for my daughter for her 4th birthday. She's 50%for height and 40% for weight. Based on reviews, I purchased the small (4-6). It fits with no room to spare. Issue is that after wearing it around the house on just 2 occasions, the front of the leotard pilled in 2 different places. Pilling must have been caused by a combination of the nylon material and my daughter's sharp edged toys. So, if you are purchasing this strictly for dance classes, this is fine. But if you are purchasing this for playing ballerina at home, consider a cotton/spandex leotard."
3.0,Those earrings are really pretty and have good quality.<br /><br />I was just a little disappointed when I realized the size. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting...
3.0,I ordered a 2X but when I tried them on they were a tad bit smaller than I expected. If you are on the bigger end and like it a little up further on your tummy order a size or two up. Other than that they are pretty comfortable and breathable.
3.0,This mask is scratchy. The pocket is too small to cover my filter. The mask runs small. I am an averaged sized woman I ordered a small/medium. I should have ordered a larger size.I could have made a better choice for my money.
3.0,Extremely thin it won’t keep you warm but I like the design
3.0,smaller than I wanted it but it will work for a while
3.0,The pieces are beautiful but a few of them are to large for me liking.
3.0,Very pretty. Just runs super small.
3.0,"The colors and wash ability were great, and as someone previously stated, no ironing needed. You can wear with jeans for a casual look or a skirt to the office. Due to the lack of stretch, I would recommend going up a size if you would like to reach for something without it tightening across the back shoulders. I am 5' 7"" , with bust of 40"" and bought a large. Should have gotten an XL."
3.0,I was expecting a bathing suit. What we received was more like a bathing suit liner.
3.0,Cute...absolutely not for an adult. It fit my 10yr old perfectly. I got an XL...
3.0,"It was an original Ghurka, but it came damaged, it didn’t look new, most likely its been in storage for a while..I returned it."
3.0,Not true to size. Disappointed
3.0,"I purchased the black glitter ring. The sturdiness of the band is fine, and the width is perfect for my taste. The size on this is a little small. I normally order 8.5 to 9, but the size 9 is tight. What is most disappointing, however, is the lack of discernible glitter. Even under bright light, I can see just a few green flecks. Otherwise it looks like a black ring."
3.0,"while this was very inexpensive, I was still unimpressed.  The charms fell off as soon as I took it out of the packaging.  As a whole it is ok but in the future would invest my money in different costume jewlry"
3.0,"The red, white, and blue strap is great! The fake leather one is terrible."
3.0,I was expecting it to be a warmer bathrobe. Very light. On the large size. Stick to your size there is added room.
3.0,It's ok not as sporty looking as I thought.
3.0,Runs small and doesn’t have much stretch. Doesn’t work if you have larger chest.
3.0,It was okay but the seams were very visible.
3.0,"So, these fit alright, but they are SO stiff. It feels like you're wearing cardboard cups. And the underwire is SO squeaky! It was creaking with every move I made. They're really cute, but just not very functional."
3.0,The tights are of good quality but run very small. I bought them for my very petite sister and they didn't go above her mid-thigh.
3.0,These are cute. Not as clear once the plastic is removed as I would like it too be.
3.0,"When I first got this I was not happy with the way it for or the level of comfort. It was bulky for no reason.<br />Once I figured out I could just cut off the extra piece because it was really just decoration, it fit and felt much better."
3.0,Didn’t work good for my 5 year old. She’s very smart but couldn’t grasp the concept of the puzzle for some reason.
3.0,"Unfortunately I should have listened to the reviewers who said the size ran small, rather than those who said it was just right.  Too tight to wear and the cups don't seem to cover enough."
3.0,"For being as inexpensive as it was, I’m sure I got what I paid for. The picture is much nicer than the actual ring. It’s VERY narrow. Also, it’s difficult to tell that there’s an infinity symbol: it looks more like the letter x."
3.0,I love sweaty bands.  The color is off.  The one I got was grey not blue.
3.0,this wasn't my favorite watch band. it is very thin and just feels really cheap. I wouldn't recommend.
3.0,"They are the same shape as the original Oakley lenses, but that's where the similarly ends. Not the same quality at all. Not even close!"
3.0,"Super cute shirt, but VERY SMALL! So, I gave it to my daughter"
3.0,Thought it was bigger. Nice for what it is. It’s now my wallet for my wallet.
3.0,"UPDATED REVIEW ON APRIL 28, 2022:<br />I've had an incredible customer service experience with these glasses and the company. Upon writing my review, I was immediately contacted by the seller who expressed their deepest apologies for the problem with the glasses. Within a matter of hours, another pair was on their way to me. Like the first pair, these were fabulous in filtering out the sun and the UV rays. Unlike the first pair, they were well constructed and I've had no problem at all with them. As any manufacturer knows, once in a while, there's a dud. As any customer knows, problems happen, but it's how the company deals with them and stands by their product. Thank you to the team that provided this outstanding service. Rare, but very valuable.<br /><br />While the glasses are certainly light weight and very good at shielding the sun, the construction is shabby as one lens popped out on the first day I had them and it would not fit back in the frame. I had bought them for a vacation and ended up having to buy a new pair of sunglasses while on the island."
3.0,"I love the cut of this dress and the fabric is thicker than one would expect (especially for the price). However, it is a dress that is probably best left to a size S or M, because the larger the size, the more square and blocky the dress becomes. Part of this is due to the fact that the skirt is so short, there is nothing to balance width against length. I ordered up a size and while the dress technically fits me fine with some room to spare, I have a butt and the skirt barely covers it when I'm standing straight up. Even bending over a little is enough to expose my entire backside. I have tunics that are longer than this dress. It's designed more like a tennis dress, where seeing ball shorts or some form of undergarment is the norm. So while I love the cut of the dress and how it looks on the model, I would not recommend this to anyone above a size medium, MAYBE a size large if you don't carry weight in your hips/butt. If it were a few inches longer, it would be a great dress, but it is out of proportion in larger sizes."
3.0,Has lasted a week... poorly made and some of liking was missing.
3.0,"There is practically NO silver in this belly ring, it's almost all gold/copper and the butterfly is pretty small. it was a gift i wouldn't be thrilled if i had actually purchased it myself."
3.0,Way smaller than size states
3.0,The shirt is... fobby  (weird English). My fault for not reading more closely.  I wish it was a little longer in the back for me. The material is a little sweaty feeling for me but I'm glad it's a nursing shirt.
3.0,"A bit on the expensive side, but ust what I wanted and received."
3.0,The front and back when worn criss-crossed around the neck gather in a strange way - poke out a bit. Maybe steaming it will make it sit better.
3.0,I loved this plugs! They were so cute and exactly like the picture. The only problem I had with them was that they were a bit small for my ears...but that was my mistake. I’m in between sizes so I probably should’ve ordered a size bigger. But other than that they are awesome!
3.0,It was smushed due to the shipping. I couldn't get it to pop back out but other than that it was fine. Perfect for a tea party bridal shower
3.0,Not what I was looking for as they were too big and very cheaply made
3.0,Be careful! Does not securely clip. Easily comes apart under a little pull. Which is not ideal since it’s a knife 😳
3.0,"Nice bag, I like it, but I have one complaint ... it STINKS to high heaven!  Some kind of chemical(ish) odor inside the bag.  I've tried Febreze, perfume and dryer sheets, but I can't get the odor to go away.  Every time I open it I get a waft of stink.  It smells like something died in there.  On a normal day, that may be the case with a bag I've used for some time because there's no telling what might be in there.  But since this is a brand new bag, I cleaned out all the dead and decaying items when I transferred the contents from my old bag.  And those smelled better than this.  Find a way to ditch the stench and this bag will receive a five star rating."
3.0,This is a cute shirt I had to give it to my daughter because again not made an America this was an extra extra large and it was three times too small
3.0,"I bought this for beach use. The water bottle holder is too small and shallow, only shorter bottle will stay in place.  The drawstring closure on top won’t stay closed.  I like that it is lightweight but wishing I had returned it."
3.0,Pretty lace & colors but the cups were so small & not flattering & not very supportive. To flimsy of a bra......good for a teenager but not a 62 year old.
3.0,"well I kwon I didn't pay much for that s*** but it could have been better but  I like it,"
3.0,Does what it was designed for. It's basically two pieces of lamented cardboard held together with an elastic band but that's kinda the point of the product.
3.0,"Glasses were comfortable and loved the lenses, however the lenses kept slipping out."
3.0,"Runs small in shoulders dosen't completely close in front, nice quality for price. BUTTONS are tiny will not carry weight of cape, will have to widen button holes and larger button. Attracts stuff but nice."
3.0,"This is a very pretty shirt, the only issue I have is that the bottom of the shirt the very awkward looking. Very tight up top and around your waist then it flares out at the bottom but not like a loose wave, it looks strange. Other than that it is nicely made and not cheap feeling or looking."
3.0,I bought 6 one for each bridesmaids I really love them!!
3.0,Very cute especially on first wear.  First washing color faded pretty significantly and around the neck bleed to white.  Exchange was super easy for a new one and haven’t washed new one yet
3.0,The item is similar but not exact. It is not flowy and lavish as pictured. Significantly less material so no spin feel but the colors are true.
3.0,"Should be shipped in a box. Mine arrived with two cracks, I glued and taped together. Other wise it works."
3.0,Colors vibrant. Material medium to thick. Not see through. Sizing is a bit on the small size. I should’ve ordered a size bigger for my daughter. I waited too long to send back.
3.0,Too small in the bust.
3.0,love how they look. a little stiff on the inside and my feet get kind of hot. No padding to take some of the stress off my foot. Not a bad boot for the cost.
3.0,"They are beautiful, but the post on one of the earrings was slightly bent when I opened it. I don't know if that was something that happened during shipping, or if it is just soft. The post bent back straight super easy, now I worry if it might break at some point."
3.0,This is such a cute outfit. But it runs very large! Swallows my girl.
3.0,"These gloves are well made and warm, but very tight fitting. I could not wear them and decided to return them.  Also, I tried the touch screen usage out, and it did not work on my Samsung phone."
3.0,"These are a great concept and works well. However, the color we choose have more white than the other darker colors. The white picked up a lot of dirt as my son walked through the amusement park between water rides."
3.0,I liked it...in general but had to return because it was a bit small across the chest. that may not be everyones issue but... there isn't much stretch
3.0,Great color but too small
3.0,Cute to bad you can’t buy them in stores but daughter loved them
3.0,These are very cute socks but run extremely small. I would order two additional sizes up to be on the safe side.
3.0,"It’s okay, but not great. It was a little big. It looks like a much better fit in the photo, material isn’t great. What I received wasn’t quite what I expected. It’s okay, just not something I’d order again."
3.0,"I love the idea of this swimsuit. The sizing is off though. The bottoms fit a little bit on the big side and the top is incredibly small!!! It's like someone put together a size small top and a size large bottoms. I love the design and will still wear it in the summer, but top sizing really needs to match the measurements better."
3.0,"I ordered 2 sizes up based on reviews and my 34D bra size. The large is enormous on me. 5'5"", 135lbs. The straps are super long and the sides are baggy. I'm going to alter the straps and just wear it loose, but I wanted a sexier fit."
3.0,Mmm !! Look cheap material
3.0,I wish I could have kept this but had to return due to short length and smaller than expected.
3.0,I like that they ship on time. What I don't like is its not really high rise as mention and the pic shown.
3.0,"Was looking forward to wearing this on my trip to Jamaica. Unfortunately, it was too small and I had to return."
3.0,Don't know if I rec'd the wrong size but ordered a large and rec'd what appeared to be a small. No size was on the dress so dont know if they're all small or I was just sent the wrong size. The material felt nice and thick but had to return it. might reorder
3.0,"nice sweater, very short on me though and i'm only 5'2 . i was hoping/ expecting a longer flowy sweater this is short and boxy"
3.0,Super cute and fun to play around with.
3.0,"good price and has worked well over past couple months.  I do wish the band was a little more comfortable, but don't see how you can get around that as compared to the same type bands on others."
3.0,"This dress is...okay. The rouge color was gorgeous and the material was pretty good considering the price, but the style was just not for me. The fit and the neckline made it look kind of matronly on my small frame and I felt it wasn't suited for a 20-something. I'm 5'1, 98 lbs, 32DD and the small was a little big in the waist. The sash helped, but it still looked off. I was hoping to love this but I ended up returning."
3.0,Just the size of it
3.0,"I'm a 42DD so I ordered an XXL based on the reviews and it's way too big. It doesn't hold anything up at all. I'm still going to keep it because it's super cute, but if I order another one I'll probably get the XL."
3.0,"If I had written this review immediately after putting the items on, it would have had a four or five star rating, but I've had second thoughts as I've worn for two days now. Honestly, I'd still rate it a 3 1/2 or so...but, don't feel too comfortable with the full four after two days of wear.<br /><br />These are nice for the price. The padding is nice and doesn't squish you down like most sports bras. My daughter commented that it did not look like I was wearing a sports bra and she thought I had a normal bra on, so it does look nice even in a thin t-shirt.<br /><br />Luckily, I read other reviews that said it runs small...and yes, it does! I ordered the XXL (For reference: I normally wear a 38B bra or XL on most sports bras). I'm slightly overweight, but certainly don't feel like I should have to order a 3x to get a really good fit...but, that is apparently what I would have to do. It fit immediately out of the package, but it fit very, very well. I will have to always wash in cold water and always hang to dry because there is NO ROOM for error or shrinkage. If I were ordering again, I would go with the 3x.<br /><br />I wore it the first day and loved it--even slept in it and wore it around the house the next day. A few times, I kept feeling like it was rubbing up into my underarm &amp; a few hours into the second day, it was kind of bugging me. When I went to shower, I realized I had a red &quot;burn&quot; mark all along where the armhole rubs my underarm, so now I am a bit torn on my feelings for this item. It seems the rolled fabric on the arm hole is too rough or something and is irritating my under arm. It was not cutting into me, to where there was any arm fat hanging over, so I'm not sure it should have done that.<br /><br />In conclusion: I don't regret buying them. I'll wear around the house for chores/under PJs, etc for light activities but I won't wear them to the gym or to yoga (where I would have a lot of arm movement) because of the rubbing issue."
3.0,"This is an awesome purse, beauty and elegant on the outside.  But for me, I need something more on the inside, and this just didn't cut it.  I have several EJ purses, but they are the standard top closure style with inside pockets big enough to use for storage.  It's difficult to get inside this purse because the material is of such a high quality that it is quite firm.  I just didn't like the inside.  SAD to have to return it.  I'd like the material in a TOTE style, I might by several in different colors.  A blue &amp; Gray would be nice, or black and white.  Two tones of red would be awesome.  Hmmmm.  Just sayin' .....  Not a fan of this purse's draw string closure, but really love the material on the outside."
3.0,I was under the impression that they would fit loser and not so tight
3.0,"Nice watch, but returned it."
3.0,"These are okay. The gems look like they might flick off eventually, but that's sort of true of most costume jewelry like this. My biggest issue is that the inside of the swirly part of the metal has a pure white enamel on it. It looks like a reflection in the pictures, but it's really obvious in person. It's not all rose gold toned."
3.0,They really don't prevent night glare.  Just turns lights yellow.  Don't work for me.
3.0,"The quality is great, sizing is perfect, unfortunately I have to return it due to the color it's much darker than expected"
3.0,"I only wore this watch band for a day because the loop that holds the slack of the strap was unbearably itchy. In that short amount of time, the cow hide pattern was already beginning to rub off. Cute, but I returned."
3.0,Smaller than I'd have liked. Did not last more than a month before it started falling apart. It was cute though-I received several compliments before it died.
3.0,Material not as good quality as expected. There's a hole after three uses but I patched it up just fine. Super cute though
3.0,Compre 8.5 soy 8 y aun así molestan un poco
3.0,These were very cheaply made. The backs are wobbly.
3.0,Bought it as a gift. It does say &#34;prettytoy&#34; on the strap. So that brings the stars down. It's small but works. Person likes it.
3.0,However I haven’t had them that long and they are already tarnished. What the French toast?
3.0,This was too small on mw.
3.0,This bag is cute and spacious. The material is thinner than I would like so I have to be careful not to wear it out too quickly. There were some loose strings and one of the zippers already broke after a week of using it.
3.0,"The dress is beautiful, but a little small for my baby."
3.0,Simply too tight. I can't extend my arms above my collar bone or these will rip off my shirt. They are fully extended too so they need to have a larger size available or at least put a description containing dimensions. I have the foot loops.
3.0,"I purchased the Red in size Medium.<br />Approximate measurements laying flat unstretched:<br />Waist across front 14.5""<br />Rise 8""<br />Inseam 31""<br />Across Thigh 8.75""<br />Across Cuff 11.5""<br /><br />I typically wear a comfortable size 6 in American Eagle jeans and medium in lounge/sweat pants. On me the medium were a relaxed fit from the waist to cuff. Not slim/snug anywhere. The waist measurement is correct for a size medium but has no elastic, it's just doubled fabric which is really stretchy and doesn't feel secure. The drawstring is the only thing holding these up. Fabric is medium weight, similar to soft sweatshirt material but not fluffy on the inside. All three pockets are functional. Overall I'm fairly happy with them but probably need a size smaller."
3.0,.me for small little A.  quality Good.  styling Nice
3.0,"Very well designed but emblem on back is off set. "" crooked "".Quality of shirt seems good. I would buy from this company again."
3.0,Beautiful shoes but the Embellishments seams bother in the toe area
3.0,"PROS:<br />  - Great price point that is competitive for product; great idea<br />  - Material feels like quality<br /><br />CONS:<br />  - Zipper went off the track the first time I opened it to check it out; slid it back on track to see if it falls off again<br />  - False advertisement as far as men's shoes- I wear size 11 and it could barely hold a pair of dress shoes in there, with flip flops in the mesh compartment.  I had to angle my flip flops to make it fit.  Trying to close it with just two things is a chore and I have to adjust/stretch the bag to make sure it closes- with a loose zipper, I'm not confident about it staying while it's packed.  I also don't want my shoes squished and damaged that way.  I tried more casual tennis shoes and it's a little better but not by much.<br />  Highly doubt if I could barely fit my 11's in there, that men with sizes up to 14 could fit.<br /><br />  If you're a size 10 (men's) or smaller, then this would probably be a good fit, without squishing your shoes or stretching the bag to capacity."
3.0,This was a gift and the chain broke.  Very pretty though..
3.0,These are nice pants but run a little small. I got the XL and they are a bit tight when other XL pants fit just right.
3.0,"These pants are so cute, but the material was not cotton or stretchy like other joggers I have. I am 5'4 and 140 lbs and ordered a large. The length was perfect, but the area from waist to crotch was really long, so I have to roll the waist over, which affects the length. I wear these mostly around the house for that reason."
3.0,Cute but I ordered too big
3.0,"Color in image looks like bright blue but is actually a dark teal color. Still like the shorts, but they were not the color I wanted. -2 stars for that, but 5 star on the fit. Fit perfect. 5'7 and around 150, large fit great. Seems like great material and dried really fast. Does not stretch much in the fabric itself but waistband is stretchy."
3.0,"Very cute design. I would definitively not go working out in this (I am a 36 B) as the cups move inside the bra. It's cute under shirts that show the back, and has enough support for casual-running errands wear.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed that the cup has a dent in it that won't seem to come out... all and all though for about $4 it was worth it."
3.0,I rather it be a different material. The rubber gets caught on clothing causing the band to come off the watch.
3.0,Very cute but only for toddlers not for 8 year old  😏Unfortunately I had to return it.
3.0,"I an 5'5&#34;  , 125lbs and ordered the blue dress. Its a much more bright and saturated color; nothing like the picture. It is definitely snug, but the dress extends to just above my knees. The material is very sheer and I will have to recycle some cloth to make it less see through. Just remember you are getting what you payed for!"
3.0,Love these plugs. Cute and lightweight! Very glittery and shiny. Super comfy.<br /><br />Update: changing review of 5 to 3 stars. The resin used to make these becomes sticky and tacky if you wear these plugs daily. Chemicals in the skin must weaken the bonds which could release toxins. The center and back of plugs become tacky. Can leave nail imprints.
3.0,"Two layers, a glove within a glove. The inside glove is somewhat twisted and I have a hard time getting my long fingers in their respected finger holes. Once on, they're warm and comfortable, though somewhat snug and bulky. I wouldn't want to try to pick up loose change, but they're designed to provide warmth, and they do. I cannot speak to the waterproof claim, cause all the water around here is frozen."
3.0,"Super cute looks great, but way too big."
3.0,"Very small.  Although it fit,  had no pockets.  Not how a hoodie should fit... Needed more room,  but there were no other size options,  unfortunately.  Otherwise,  very cute!"
3.0,"Let's just say, they looked better on the model."
3.0,Didn’t like the fit it’s all wide not like curvyish like the picture
3.0,"The hoodie is true to size, my son says it’s okay, I personally don’t like the material. After awhile it develops little lint balls."
3.0,"The sides of the bracelet are hard, so it is uncomfortable on a small wrist. However, the closure allows flexibility around the arm so it’s not too tight but Fitbit still can get data."
3.0,"I initially got this watch for my brother and her really liked it. One down side is that it was not that durable. After about a month, the nub on the side that was used to change the time fell off. Still a great cosplay piece!"
3.0,Not quite sure yet.
3.0,"I ordered a size 12. They're too small and much smaller than other size 12 sandals I've purchased in the past. When I attempted to return, received the message this item is not eligible for returns. So definitely order a size bigger than you normally do. Other than that, these sandals are OK."
3.0,"This is a cute dress but you really should be shapely for it to fit well.  I have a pretty straight frame and the dress just kind of hung off my body.  Also, the material seemed to wrinkle easily.  It's almost satin like so it felt great but seems like it would be wrinkly after wearing for any amount of time."
3.0,Decent for cosmetic jewelery
3.0,It is really see through but hard to get the top up on the shoulders.  In ordered a 3x
3.0,"Amending my review.  Downgrading from 5-stars to 3-stars only because of flimsy buckles. All the below is true, but....the buckles are incredibly cheap. The hook on a buckle bent severely and very very easily, almost like butter. They took the bag back and gave me a full refund and I had intended on getting another but given the quality of the buckles I decided against it. Man, if they would spend a few dollars more to get good buckles it would be an awesome bag! VERY heavy though, so be warned.  NOW...read below for the rest of my review.<br /><br />Are you looking for an awesome leather bag big enough to fit just about anything you want? Are you looking for a testosterone infused briefcase / overnight bag? Want a bag that is unlike any other (in a good way)?  This is it. HEAVY leather reminiscent of an old saddle bag, this is a cool ""briefcase."" I put it in quotes because it is a bit on the large side, but not overbearingly so. I will also be using this as an overnight bag. I know when I put this in the overhead compartment the bag will get some stares.  Now, it is heavy. I haven't weighed it, but the shipping details it at 7 pounds. I would guess the bag is 5-7 lbs for sure. So be warned, this is not a light, flimsy leather briefcase.<br /><br />All three front buckles are usable, which the picture doesn't show. Roomy inside with a zippered compartment. Inside is plenty of room for just about anything, including binders, folders, computer (no padded computer compartment (thankfully)), change of clothes, etc. It does have that leather smell, so will wait on clothes for now until the smell dissipates.<br /><br />The shoulder strap is VERY long because it doubles as a backpack. The only thing I don't like about the bag is the fact that there is no leather loop through which to thread the end of the humongous strap when it is in the ""over one shoulder"" configuration, which is what most everyone will use. I have about 2 feet of dangling strap with no way to hold it down. For now I'll use some rubber bands...think I'll get to a leather maker and have them fit a couple ""belt loops"" for this strap.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a very finely made bag for an incredible price. It is heavy duty and ready for just about anything. In a way this is a keepsake. I'll be passing this bad boy down to my son years from now. I can see it weathering beautifully and am sure it will hold up given the quality I see.  I'll update this in a couple months."
3.0,The fabric is a little think
3.0,The look very good and durable but they run big. I bought a size 7/8 and it fit me perfect that I’m a 10
3.0,"Good cheap glasses, but they weren't polarized. No big deal i tend to break these things pretty quick. The hinges are nice though."
3.0,You get what you pay for; cheap quality and didn't last me very long at all. Promptly returned.
3.0,"I like the color of the strap material and am considering the gray. Hard to install. Harder still to adjust.<br />Wish one could buy these cloth straps without the extra dodads. Any of the straps I own with the extra length and hardware is inferior to a true 3-ring, 4-stitch NATO strap. Zulu straps have the extra section and hardware, but now everyone is using the terms interchangeably and the good straps appear to be gone.<br />Pretty expensive and shipping was sloooww."
3.0,Not what I expected. Tried to put all the pieces on one at a time and one  broke before I could get on my hand.
3.0,It broke the same day I wear it
3.0,Appropriate size، color and design is beautiful and also a suitable weight<br />Comparing to the price is a very good.
3.0,My wife is small this was actually lose.
3.0,I fell in love with how it looked. Made cheap though. The find tore off in the front a little. Didn't last a whole night. Material was weak.
3.0,"Material is very thin and light.  After a wash and dry, they shrunk a lot, so I would suggest getting a size bigger than what you wear."
3.0,Was shipped with no instructions on how to maintain.  I was familiar with Wind up watching .  Worked great  for 31/2mos. Then the clock hands would only  move so far both ways.  If you like this type of watch and want to take a chance  go for it.
3.0,"I didn't think about the fabric when I bought it, and as it turns out, I didn't like it. It also made me look pregnant from the side and square from the front. The back looked good, though."
3.0,"Very flimsy... Be ware.<br />Not that 20.00 is that expensive, but this piece feels more like a 5.00 junky item you might buy for a chold to play dress-up. Was not happy when it arrived. I was expecting something a bit sterdier made with better materials."
3.0,Wallet holds everything I need when traveling.  Quality of material is below par thought.
3.0,"The earrings were perfect for what I needed, which was just a new set to wear everyday. I have quite a few piercings and just tend to wear all studs. I loved the cut and they're pretty in person, however the backs didn't stay on very well and came on super easy. I ended up using the backs of my old set because they seemed to hold on a little better. Otherwise, good puchase!"
3.0,"Ordered the 0-6 mo size.  Definitely NOT 0-6 mos size, package marked &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  Took a look at the socks and they look like they could fit my almost 4 y.o. granddaughter.  Not going to return them because luckily, babies can grow into them.  Socks are a decent white cotton. Time will tell how they hold up."
3.0,I ordered a large and am typically a medium. Fits tight.
3.0,Very disappointed. I absolutely love the print and the pockets are such a plus but the bottom is so small that I can only take very small steps because the dress restricts movement. I returned mine for a refund.
3.0,"The jacket feels durable, and like it can help provide excellent warmth. The inner lining is fantastic and the attention to detail is great. However, mine did not come with the detachable hood."
3.0,Buy actual size.most items.online run small.
3.0,"...they are a little too long.  Each could be shortened in half to be exact and it would be perfect.  With a good leather cutter and some snaps, it's not too hard to modify thought."
3.0,"I like the Slim-sation line, the top band really does help slim tummy bulges.  However, these are shorter than expected.  Fortunately that look is back in, but, they won't reach your ankles.  I'm 5'10&#34; and I don't think they make a &#34;tall&#34;.  Sadly."
3.0,Boughtt two years ago replaced battery ran well but now seems to stop running every once in a while. Not sure if it needs another battery??
3.0,Good band but bear in mind since it is ceramic it may break if you drop it. Mine did. I like the look and feel but next time I would buy a metal band.
3.0,"I really liked these at first and I gave them as a gift from my kids to their grandmom and aunt Mother’s  day , but after minimum usage, the charm comes off."
3.0,Too shiny.  Looks cheap.  Supports OK.
3.0,"Cute style but this is WAY too short for a 2T.  I ordered this for my granddaughter and it fits throughout the body but it barely covers her bottom standing up.  When she bends over or squats, it shows her underwear.  She is not tall for her age, in fact she’s a bit on the more petite side."
3.0,"I love the color but in regards to waterproof, it lack some. Was used during the Five Boros in New York and it did not held with all the rain!!!"
3.0,"nice but the only thing is the coin slot is unable to keep the coins, they come out on the sides though"
3.0,The sizing is just what you would expect. However it seems like they were put together wrong. You can't tell which is the left and which is the right. Both sandals look like the split is right in the middle. This also made my toes hurt alot after wearing them for a while. The socks that come with them are very comfortable though.
3.0,It looked like scrubs. I returned it.
3.0,"Low impact product. &#34;High impact&#34; in product description should be edited or removed. My wife purchased with the expectations being met based on product description, since there's no way to try items on with an online order. Description needs to match the product."
3.0,Order a size up otherwise nice shirt
3.0,"For an extra large it was some what tight but comfortable, however it was a little too short. I ordered to wear to a dinner dance and sadly i wont be wearing it :("
3.0,"For the price it is fine, no lining but lightweight and cute."
3.0,"these are cute but the quality was s***. half of them broke, half of them i lost (obviously that part is my own fault) and as a side note let me tell you it is damn hard to take a chocker off while intoxicated, which lets face it if you're wearing a choker in 2017, you probably are."
3.0,Too see through and the sleeves are long
3.0,"Tbh, it’s great but I would have liked it in other colors."
3.0,Look really cute but look very warm out after just a week
3.0,"I wanted to like these since I normally wear compression socks. The tightness was ok. But the length seemed kinda short. I wish it was a little longer to cover my whole calf to ankle bone, and I’m 5’6. Sadly I returned them."
3.0,loved this but it was too small for my 36d chest. Had to give it to a friend. So not really one size fits all.
3.0,"Cute. Runs large. Poorly made, but still cute!"
3.0,"Wrinkled, hung it for a week and they never came out. For brides on a budget it works. But it’s more of a bug catcher than anything"
3.0,Pros:  Gorgeous vibrant eggplant color. Soft comfortable.<br /><br />Cons: neckline trim is stretched out & unattractive looking. See through - need a tabk/top underneath for sure. When it came it had little multi-colored fuzz balls all over it. Very fragile top. The threading is coming out.
3.0,Kinda tight and very thin. Was hoping for a knit beanie
3.0,"I was so excited to find the perfect alternative to a bracelet, however, it’s very hard to scan. I’ve tried it 20+ times and it has worked twice. Maybe if the QR code were printed in black instead of gray? I really do love the idea of this sleeve, but the point is convenience, and it’s not at all. If it won’t scan, it’s useless to me. I did love the ease of use filling out the profile and the layout is great! Help?!"
3.0,You for sure need to get a size bigger then it says or two if you want some extra room. I wear a XL always and the XL barely worked. I would of returned it but needed it for a party and a replacement would of not get to me in time. There is also no real stretch to the fabric. The fit is also a bit odd. Sleeves are very long and I like that but the shoulders are kinda boxy. I also wish there was a zombie elf on the front as well so people get whats going on before i turn around.
3.0,I was in high school in 2003-2007 and these chunky style heels were the thing back then. I wore them daily pretty much. Years went on and newer styles and trends came out. Now almost 10 years later I've been on tons of searchers for a pair of heels I can wear when required/needed and not feel like I'm dying and my feet/ankles are in so much pain after just 10 minutes of wearing them. I searched a lot for this style heels so excited I finally have found them. I was so excited I paid extra for the 2-day shipping. I actually didn't end up receiving my shoes until 5 days later. The seller refunded my cost for shipping though so they did make it right. I only gave 3 stars though only because I did originally pay the shipping since I had a funeral to attend and the promised deliver date would have been 2 days before the funeral I planned to wear them at.
3.0,"Not what I expected but I'll give it a try. These are both a nice print, I like the foldability AND fully-zippered top, and based on the reviews is why I decided on this item. However, now I wish I got a canvas bag instead. I need a nice &#34;personal item&#34; to carry on board a no-frills airline for a 4-day trip tomorrow to double as a purse. (I don't want to use a backpack or pay for a carry-on for such a short trip.) I should've read between the lines from the description and reviews. The bags feel and smell like a shower curtain you just took out of the bag. There's no lining, no inside/outside zippered compartment for anything, and I mistakenly equated &#34;nylon&#34; with &#34;denier  polyester.&#34;  I'm concerned with  the &#34;strong leather straps&#34; ripping from the main body since they don't go further down or around the bottom--oh, and there is no reinforced bottom (thin cardboard or double fabric) like I have on some other portable/folding bags. I can only use the smaller bag as a cosmetics/toiletries bag. Anyway, hope these bags holds up."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this, it was the kind of Amazon purchase that I knew would be a risk but I tried it anyway. The shoulders are sewn together so oddly it looks bulky & pointed on both sides. The material is knit obviously, however it’s not a cozy knit. It actually feels quite scratchy. This is fine to layer over a long sleeve shirt but maybe not a short sleeve. My toddler got pop tart all over the sweater, so while I had every intention to return it I no longer could. Maybe after I wash it the fabric will become softer?? I wouldn’t count on it, but I’ll update my review IF it comes out softer."
3.0,Comfortable but it is very light and see-through
3.0,Smaller than I thought it would be but it actually sits perfect on my neck
3.0,Gift to inspire
3.0,Nothing special!!
3.0,"Arrived on time, But fit tight, I'll tried to work  with them."
3.0,Color not tight enough. To loose otherwise nice fit. True to size.
3.0,First of all I read every review and still ordered it lol I'm not entirely sure on what I was expecting however it's a cute dress. I'm 5'6 181 and I got a Large. . I was super nervous it would arrive In time to go on my trip with my boyfriend but it did. The only issue I have is the material is sooooo thin. Like legging material. The stretchy spandex kind. . Not drifit either. It's not entirely see through. . But I'm going to forgoe my undies and bra when I do wear it just because the material is so thin I could see my thong lines. . Over all I'm. It too disappointed. It's not terrible. . But I won't order another one of these lol
3.0,"The quality and lightweight and the fact that it is water resistant was my main reason for purchasing.  Sadly, when it arrived, it was too small.  I ended up passing it down because it was such a good value for the product I didn't want to send it back."
3.0,"The material was cheap as was the stretchy waistband, but it only kinda looked that way. It was very interesting. I could see myself wearing it on a vacation, but I ended up returning it."
3.0,I’m 160 lbs 5’6 36c cup ordered a size medium and this fits comfortably however the band width is too loose for me to be comfortable wearing this during workout I’d prefer a tighter bra fit. I’m worried the small will be too tight on my stomach tho
3.0,"It cleans my gold jewelry fine.  As far as cleaning my silver jewelry that is questionable.  It turned one of my silver necklaces almost black.  Fortunately, I had something else to clean it."
3.0,"It is lovely, but one inside snap will not close. I would like to return it if another is available."
3.0,A little thinner than I expected.
3.0,"I like the anklet, visually.  It's super cute.  But it's cheap and broke within a day of wearing it."
3.0,"Cute, but really small...like for a child.  Otherwise, the collar is moderately vibrant."
3.0,Worked for my party
3.0,"Do not be confused, this shirt is a dress. It goes down to my knees. The top fits very well and looks just like the picture, but I will wear it as a sheer dress/coverup and not a shirt."
3.0,Okay but not large enough for big groceries.
3.0,Adjustable snaps don’t stay closed very well otherwise a good hat.
3.0,I like the color and it fit me well. I have wider hips and am 5’8.5” with no issues with sleeve length or fitting over my hips to zip. A few  things I disliked were: the multiple loose strings at seems and buttons. the hood doesn’t stay up if any wind and it sits funny on the color. The material is quite wrinkled and will need a steamer. I did enjoy it overall though and it traveled with me for my flights quite well. It was expected for the low price
3.0,The bracelet is nice. I wish the quality would have been better...
3.0,Very cute..but the lettering already stated fading after 2 washes.
3.0,Straps were definitely way too short!
3.0,"After using one of the bands for about a month the metal part that sits on your skin has started rusting. They were cheap so I’m not angry about it, but it was kind of a disappointment. I will also mention that the softness and the matte aspect of the silicone started wearing off and became shiny and kind of tacky/sticky."
3.0,"The watch winder is much larger than I thought it would be based on the photographs. That's okay, but my watch doesn't really fit on it either. I didn't realize this wouldn't be a good auto winder for a ladies watch. I end up having to use padding around my watch to make it fit."
3.0,"Cute dress, just smaller than I expected. Quality isn’t the best but definitely decent for the price point"
3.0,Cute but very dainty arrived unhooked on one side had to fix it
3.0,"Super cute, colors same in person as in pictures.<br /> Lasted about 4 days of pool before the ends starts to have holes. So this one is good for vacation pack and throw out after. Doesn't come with fin, but kid/ adult fin can easily be put in."
3.0,"The swim suit was very cute but I found it to be pretty small. I ordered the large. I am 5’3”, 135 pounds and usually a medium and 6/8 pant. I really hoped the suit would fit. The 3 stamps that make up the back were kinda weird and hard to get lined up right I guess. But it was a cute suit and good for the $$. The tank top was decent though. Wish I would have ordered the xl"
3.0,"they fit in the waist perfect, but length is a bit lacking by 3 inches. I measured my sons inseam and leg length too. Ih6ank goodness I see and can add the length myself. for the cost thought a great deal."
3.0,"The name for these is misleading...the studs only have push-on backs, not lever back. I really wanted something that didn't have a separate back. They are nice looking but the name and description of this item should be updated."
3.0,"Apparently like some other reviewers I too did not notice the &#34;slim fit&#34; of these leggings when purchasing.  They are so soft and the length is pretty good for me at only 5 feet tall, but I cannot imagine them fitting a taller woman.  My main concern is that I'm quite curvy so these do not fit well over my bottom.  They fit great around my tummy, but are simply too low in the back.  I kept them because they were affordable and I can wear them around the house with a long sweater, but I wish they offered a larger size so I could repurchase them in a size that fit properly."
3.0,"These are great stocks, but only last about four trips to the waterpark. The bottoms get worn through. I would still buy them again though since they do protect against the hot concrete. The lack of more stars is based on their durability."
3.0,Not as cute as in the picture. Almost looks clownish. Haven't worn it yet
3.0,Very cute dress! Love it but the only problem is you can see through the dress you can see my shorts.
3.0,I prefer stainless steel
3.0,I must have ordered the wrong size
3.0,Way too large for children.  Returned the items.
3.0,"Cute barbells, but first of all these are EXTERNALLY threaded which is not ideal for any piercing. The balls on this are larger than most which also means although technically the same length overall there is less space on the barbell. Just barely large enough for me. So sassy though and I love that."
3.0,Hoping I will be able to wear but not really an XL.
3.0,It fell of the chain
3.0,One word describes the clip on sunglasses—cheap and they may scratch my lenses.
3.0,Debieron ser un poco más largas para hacer más fácil y cómoda la colocación
3.0,Nice color but very thin. I don't think they are worth the money.
3.0,"The glasses are stylish and would be great by themselves. However, they do not fit over my prescription glasses, even though my glasses are fairly small and these are listed as oversize. I am a little disappointed. I am using them in front of my glasses now, but this will get old real fast."
3.0,"These are really pretty crappy, but I needed them for a costume for one night, so they worked. You are definitely getting what you pay for. There's stretch out, but not back! They kept sliding off my butt all night. No worries they held up for the night. I even washed them and they're alright - on delicates and in a lingerie bag. If I need to look like a fish again, well they'll probably work."
3.0,"face could be clearer, but you can't beat the price. comfortable and wears well. would be a great kids watch."
3.0,"I am 5’5” 120lbs and 32dd and this bra did not fit me well at all. First of all it is much more pink in person, but that aside it was quite large on me. The cups were much bigger than other bras and though the band fit, it was too wide on my rib cage. But listen this bra is made really well and will probably fit another body type!"
3.0,Reflective material ?
3.0,"I feel like I channel my inner badass in this outfit. It's very cute and I like the velour fabric on the outside. But I was super disappointed that the inside fabric is some cheap polyester fabric, was expecting a soft fabric on the inside. It's comfortable though so it's ok, just not what I was hoping the fabric would be, I was expecting it to be velour throughout."
3.0,I have lots of hair and have similar hat that fits great. This one felt a little small
3.0,Dont like the look
3.0,It's a super cute not over the top nice occasion dress. Mine came with discoloration on the back sadly.
3.0,"With the description written as a long skirt, I expected this to be ankle length. Disclaimer: I didn't read the size descriptions which states it's 27"" long, although it's hard to figure out what's what as they use different descriptions  for the sizing. I bought the age 10 size for a small 10 year old and I think it will be barely calf length. This size measures an actual 25"" in length."
3.0,"I brought this my 11 years old daughter who is going to start ballet soon. She really liked it, and I thought it was really nice, though it arrived two days later than the expected time. Usually, I wouldn't make a big deal out of it but since she'll need it very soon for her ballet class, it mattered a lot. Also, the products I usually get from Amazon never arrives late. Though overall it was an okay/good product. would recommend to anyone, though just expect it to maybe arrive a little bit late. Also, don't buy a size too small. My daughter, she's 11 and she had to wear the size 12-15."
3.0,"These are pretty cheesy looking.  The clasp is very loose, and it would easily come apart if not on a cord/chain.  I may put a dab of glue on them to make sure it stays together.<br /> They're useable, but not as nice as I had hoped."
3.0,This is a bodycon type dress that is not made of cotton but rather some kinda polyester material. Buy a bigger size
3.0,I normally wear a Medium.<br />I ordered this bra in a Large.<br />It’s tight!!!<br />The cup padding is removable.<br />Even once removed - the bra is too tight.<br />I would say an XL would fit me much better but the bra doesn’t have a 4 way stretch like I would expect.<br />I really like the color of the bra.<br />The straps of the bra sat wider on my shoulders than I expected.
3.0,Hard to open.  Had to slip jeans down over my hips the first two times.  Have to take pressure off to get it to loosen.
3.0,fades after one wash
3.0,"On a petite 5'2"" frame looks frumpy."
3.0,Ala primera puesta se descosió todo entre las piernas y zíper
3.0,"I hate having to wear a mask, so i decided to try these. They are easy to breathe through, and washable,  so that's nice, but I have a larger head and neck so they are pretty snug and therefore not as comfortable as I had hoped they'd be."
3.0,"Quality fabric. But, size was way off! And, I chose the largest size!"
3.0,Body too short for even an average height body.
3.0,You get what you pay for.  It was cheaply made.
3.0,"I waited such a long time for this order to arrive. When it finally did I was disappointed. I didn't receive a variety of patterns but instead, all six masks had one pattern. The mask fabric is soft which is the biggest plus but the mask is large and gapes at the side when tightened to fit your face. I will take time to sew darts but after such a long wait I was once again regretting an online purchase."
3.0,"These are comfortable although I wish they hugged my butt cheeks a  bit more to prevent riding.<br />Also-  these are for wearing when you have your period, so why make the lining white?!<br />They end up stained with blood and look terrible.  Please make the lining black too, or at least a dark color."
3.0,This cardigan is essentially t-shirt fabric. Looks as described but the fabric isn't warm at all
3.0,Too long for me. I'm 5'3&#34; and it hit mid-shin on me which was not flattering. Would probably look great on a tall girl! :)
3.0,"It’s so cute, but definitely too small for my 4 year old boy."
3.0,Tught everywhere except for waist area. super weird
3.0,"I thought this was a beautiful, high-quality jade bracelet.  Unfortunately, it was too small for me, and I had to return it.  I hope that the manufacturer will produce it in a size xl in the future so that I can repurchase it."
3.0,"Love shape & color but hate the size, wish they were bigger"
3.0,Nice bag.  Not this color at all
3.0,"It’s oddly short in the back and hangs lower in the front. I have not much booty and double D bust so it’s not my shape doing this. That being said, it’s comfie enough to sleep in and since Covid has me sleeping alone the look doesn’t matter so much."
3.0,L was  way too small and XL way too big?
3.0,"The color is a bit dull, but they do the job"
3.0,Can tell it's is poor quality.
3.0,This dress is cute but was a little disappointed with the material.
3.0,I really dislike the white on the sleeves and no way to remove it..you can't pull the sleeves up because there is no give in the white strips..
3.0,Didn’t realize the jumpsuit is made of nylon
3.0,Clips slip off too easily
3.0,The quality of the product was not to my expectations.
3.0,"It came in packaged very pretty, and on time. It’s pretty but the center stone has some scratches, but for $14 it makes s really nice show!"
3.0,The frame may fit a child or someone with a smaller than average face. It is too small for my face so it's not comfortable.
3.0,"Very thin material, will not buy again."
3.0,Order 2 same size defrent coulr and one small one big
3.0,"Aun no los uso, los recibí ayer pero parece que se van a romper los palillos"
3.0,"I have to return it because it’s way too tight on my head. If you know you have a larger-than-average noggin, don’t bother. Otherwise it’s really cute and seems well-made."
3.0,This is really cute and since it is cheap it is made cheap it broke the same say i wore it
3.0,It's okay.  I did receive compliments on the print! Fits true to size. I'm 190 lbs and 5'3 and got the 2X.
3.0,"Great fabric, super comfortable but disappointed in the color. Thought it would match all of our other outfits and it was way more orange than expexred"
3.0,Good fit this a pretty dress the color was a bit off for the event I needed it for.
3.0,Queda demasiado pequeño hay que comprar otra talla
3.0,"It was great looking, but had a hard time fitting on my five year olds head"
3.0,"For the price, it’s not bad. I ordered a Medium and it fit well, although I usually don’t like shirts to be to tight against my stomach and this shirt definitely showed all the rolls! It’s also a bit see through it areas that get stretched more(aka boob area). But again not a bad shirt for the price."
3.0,"It's larger than expected and thin, not going to keep him warm at all. Disappointed"
3.0,Very charming and pretty
3.0,Wishing they would come in solid colors and more variety.
3.0,one of the ribbons  isn't curly
3.0,"Very cheaply made and while it's too small in some areas (bust and stomach), it's too large in others (length) and needed hemmed. The seams are weak and the thread color choice is poor so the white thread shows in the dark blue seams"
3.0,This skirt smelled horrible out of the package. Even after a wash the scent lingers. Fits nice but still haven't worn it yet.
3.0,"Had to return these. I was hoping, by ordering a size up, they would fit my wife feet. That is often the case, but these were still way too narrow. They fit like Converse All-Stars. Those appear when I search for wide sneakers, but are so narrow in the toe box. These are too. Cute shoes, though."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this hat! It's an okay hat, and it really is kind of cute, but the thing I don't care for is that the bowl section that goes over your head is really boxy and kind of high! Really hard to explain it, but it makes my head look taller than it should be."
3.0,Very silkie
3.0,"Short runs small; i usually wear small, I<br />Ordered a medium and this fits just right on my waist. However, as I was trying to unbutton it after trying it on, one if the buttons fell out. Shorts came very wrinkled too; returning this."
3.0,"purchased for myself, but upon arrival noticed they were for a much smaller face. so will continue looking for adult size"
3.0,"Got these for my friends and myself for a trip to the bahamas, everyone thought they were very cute, but most of them were broken by the time we flew home"
3.0,"Do not even try to wear it outside. best as a nightwear. its quite chic but again, you can wear it inside."
3.0,"Based upon the pictures I though the dress was a single length around the bottom, but it appears that the dress actually comes up so it is almost mid thigh on me at the sides.  Other than that it is a comfortable dress and not super see through in the bust area."
3.0,"I do sweat a lot during hot yoga. These shorts fit well. Felt great. But when I do the tree pose and put my foot onto my inner thigh, these shorts were too slippery for me to keep my foot high on my thigh."
3.0,Just personal preference but it is too molded for my taste.
3.0,It fits my son okay but it didn't come with the belt
3.0,"Average quality and good value, but slow delivery"
3.0,"Everyone loves this. Everytime I wear it, I receive compliments."
3.0,"i have a hard time keeping the zipper up. it gradually slides down as i'm doing my workout and i have to keep pulling it up.  other than that, its ok"
3.0,"Somewhat small, not so comfortable for a busy, active day.  Seems to be of good quality, not sure I'd recommend unless you order next larger size."
3.0,Didn't realize I bought kids face coverings.<br />The writing is not as easy to read as picture because it curves under your chin.
3.0,thin metal
3.0,Runs small and looks a little cheap
3.0,"Soft material, high waisted, pinches at the waist"
3.0,Larger than expected and really wide.
3.0,"Fit as expected and was cute, although I had to return because the fabric was gapping in the arm pit area"
3.0,"This fits a little smaller than I thought it would. The material is pretty but it just kind of looks cheap... like, for example the inside is white and the outside is printed and it just looks cheap. I loved the dress for quick pictures for a photo shoot but I honestly wouldn’t wear it anywhere just because I feel like it looks cheap. Decent price though!"
3.0,I would say this shirt fits pretty small and I ordered up in size bc I like it a little loser but fit snug
3.0,"Hat is cute, but not sure worth the price."
3.0,This was a decent enough shirt. It runs small. I ordered medium in hopes of it being a little big (like most mediums are on me). The fit wasn't flattering so I returned it.
3.0,"I got these for myself and my best friend and while they fit fine, the woman's shirt shrunk a little after the first few washes. I don't wear it much, so it's not a big deal, but I probably wouldn't buy this for myself and a spouse if I planned on wearing it often."
3.0,Little pricey
3.0,This is a nice product and I thought the hat was fleece-lined. Will be returning.
3.0,They may help with keeping my hands and fingers safe but they aren't very good for gripping or picking up items.
3.0,The leggings have shorts attached which are not shown in the image. They also have a bit of a texture to the material.
3.0,The only ones that work and I can use are the straight ones can't use the curled or l shape ones when you go to use them once you get to the bend it hurts and won't go any further then the bend and the bend area on them are to sharp not enough curve to them to be used properly
3.0,"Bought these for my girlfriend and they are too big for her face, they slide right off. They work for me though."
3.0,Very comfortable. Just disappointed that the canvas started breaking away from the rubber sole in less than a year.
3.0,had fun with kids but very they break too fast. Very low build quality
3.0,"I usually wear a med or l depending on the brand, L got an XL because I wanted it to be baggy, but it was form fitting. Otherwise it would be great, cute, I liked the material, it was soft and looks like good quality."
3.0,i bought these for submission wrestling and they fit nice(I'm 140lbs 5'5&#34; purchased medium) but some threads tore along the hem when I put them on. It left no holes but nonetheless it shows the quality of the product
3.0,I ordered an XL and that should fit fine but the back doesn't even come close to covering my butt.
3.0,Watch face is so small.  It makes hard to set and hard to read.
3.0,"It's a nice bra , but it runs really small. A 34dd looks like a 34d . Definily go up a size or even 2 if your got big girlsamd consider going up waist size as well unless u like it super snug"
3.0,It's ok/ I will have to sew on some ribbon so that I can wear if it's the slightest bit breezy.
3.0,Ordered up 2 sizes and it fit ok. It wasn’t a “love” so I sent it back.
3.0,"I bought these clasps on September 21, 2016 and the last one died March 12, 2016, so they have an average lifespan of about 2 months each ... this they lasts about as long as the original Misfit Flash clips.  I do not know if I would purchase these again.  They are a decent value but there MUST be something better out there that last longer..."
3.0,Sleeve length was too short. Be sure you order a length longer than you normally would.
3.0,I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review.  The item took forever to arrive so if you need them quickly i would take a pass.  They are very light light and do not stay in your ear.  I would put an ear ring back on each if you do not want to lose the.  I did enjoy the sparkle and received several compliments on them but they they do look inexpensive.  I would purchase again only as a fun pair of week end ear rings
3.0,Very pretty but the band is too tight
3.0,Product was as discribed but the horns were bent in package. Horns are too soft and need to have something stuffed inside to have them stand up correctly.
3.0,"I ordered 4 of these. 2 came with 2 inch extenders for the chain. And the other 2 did not. If they all did, this would be 5 stars. It is a beautiful charm."
3.0,Cute purse.  Cheaply made but cute.  The clasp is a hassle.  Needed to be sewn.  I use it for travel.
3.0,"Loved the bag, I get so many compliments, however I noticed after maybe using 3 or R times the outside zipper is coming apart. I would put my keys in it so I wouldn’t have to search for them inside. The bag is really roomy inside . (Not complaining about that) Anyway I had to stop using before it got any worst. Yes, I would recommend"
3.0,"I like  it…but it’s too thin, so I have to be careful with it.  I paid too much for it, but it’s cute."
3.0,It’s a lovely necklace but is a tad small
3.0,My Recommendation is definitely wear something underneath it if you care. The material is very thin. If you don’t care it’s in fashion. Nice looking.
3.0,"Cute and fits well. 3 stars only because to get it to be puffy and full like in the photo, you'd need a petticoat"
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress but it was way too long... and the burgundy was more red than burgundy.  Due the above, I sent it back."
3.0,"Great fitting dress that is very flattering....the first time you wear it. However, after you wash it the first time it loses it's original shape. The material is so thin that after being washed the bottom and sides roll up and no amount of ironing can keep the material rolled down. It is still technically wearable however, I feel like I look like a dishevelled mess in the dress now even though it is always freshly ironed. It is a decent price if your are only looking for a one time outfit to go to a specific event or create a Bettlejuice Halloween costume."
3.0,Didn't fit but vendor provided good service.
3.0,"This was a gift for my son, and while he enjoys it, I'm not too impressed with the quality of either the hat or the mask.  The hat is adjustable, but it's still a little narrow and tight unless his hair is cropped very short.  All in all, it's just OK."
3.0,"Arrived quickly but the measurements are just a tad off, on the big side. Our current umbrella pole doesn’t fit snuggly so there’s a lot of movement, especially when it’s windy. I’m afraid it’s going to bend or warp"
3.0,"The inner bad should be changed to black (it was yellow). Other than that, I got what I paid for..."
3.0,Awesome ghost trap for Halloween but not pedal nor any batteries that are advertised to be included with the item
3.0,These were very fight at the top... if I wear them with a tight dress it looks like I've got tight belts around my thighs. Get a size up for sure.
3.0,"It’s very cute, and would be super flattering if it was sized right, the medium fits like a small. Size up!"
3.0,"Runs large, fabric is not cottony"
3.0,Definitely NOT compression socks. These are simple knee high socks...nothing more.
3.0,"Fair shoes. Last about 2-3 months. Which is the most my child's shoes can last. My pre-teen prefers pumas, and adidas."
3.0,"The tie is fine, but the order did not include the pocket square. I was also charged a sales tax- but PA does not tax clothing."
3.0,I thought this would be my Christmas dress because it seems so cute but it is not for all body times. Look like a soda bottle and just hate how it clings to my body even if it has a bit of extra fabric and should be a bit loose.
3.0,Elastic broke as I was wearing it lost almost all beads.
3.0,"I liked the material, colors n how they feel on. The only thing that I didn't like is the reason I bought them was thst hey had pockets n I was hoping I could put my phone in there. I need the phone just to get in so they can scan my membership. The 2nd machine I went on. THE Phone fell out of my pocket.  The pockets need to b deeper."
3.0,Good fit and easy to wear.
3.0,everything about this sweater is cute except that the sleeves are a little short. i ordered a large and the sleeves are about an inch away/short. otherwise it’s worth it. definitely size up.
3.0,"The color is more brown than traditional rose gold. I'd say it more resembles bronze. The sizing is accurate. The stones are inlaid more than I thought,  so it isn't as shiny as pictured, and I am constantly snagging my clothes or ripping out my hair due to the way the fixture is attached to the band. All that being said, I like the ring, and am not unhappy with the purchase. It has yet to turn my fingers green, which is better than most cheap rings."
3.0,"I've purchased 4 different patterns of these masks. The kids' ""kitten"" mask is much smaller than kids' cat, dog and tiger. It would be okay for a 2-year old, I think. I have a 3,5 and a 5 year old who are not able to wear it due to it being to small. It doesn't have much stretch to it and keeps falling off. If, say, the Kitten one is designed to be smaller that the Cat mask, it should be clearly stated in the description.<br />The other three patterns work great though. Those are my kids' favorite masks (both have large heads). I wish the sizing was more consistent or descriptions were clear."
3.0,"The color combos are cute, but the wings are too small for my face. Would be a nice gift for kids though."
3.0,They fit great and look great but are definitely not leg day worthy. You can read the tag through the pants when I squat lol
3.0,Fit was fine. Son wears 8 and ordered 8. But the material is not cottony soft. More of a polyster or something else?
3.0,"It's ok, only one side has sparkle."
3.0,Nice  fabric and feel but pants were a size larger than the top which I had already ordered a size up because I like my pj tops loose...returned and am re-ordering...frustrating as they were seemingly new and sealed in a plastic bag.....
3.0,"I  read the review before I order it. But it still doesn't work for me. For this kind of dress,  you need to wear it in the fitting room then decide to buy or not. Really like the style."
3.0,This is nice but the fit was too large so I had to return it.
3.0,"I've orded these before in a size M/L and they fit me too loose. But kept them because they were cute and comfortable.<br />After 6 months they ripped, but I did wear them a lot and worth it for the price you pay.<br />This time I ordered them again in the same grey/black coloe in a size a S/M and they were a bit too tight around the butt area.<br />So I would recommend odering you normal size."
3.0,"Product is good, rinds small. My daughter is very petite and in between a 2T-3T. Got a 3T and had to stretch forcefully to get it over her head. Her ears are pierced, so taking it off I was afraid to snag her earrings it was so tight in the neck"
3.0,"My grandson loved them, but couldn't walk in them. He kicked them off. They looked darling while they were on, though!"
3.0,Pretty green. Not really jade. Cheaply sewn. The fringe is fun.
3.0,"The fit is strange.  It is very tight at the ankles.  Other Stance socks are not like this, but several this year are.  Disappointed."
3.0,It's cheaply made so we had to do a lot of modifications.
3.0,"As someone who has almost a 36” inseam I struggle to find leggings. These are definitely long enough but feel very plastic-y, my heals snag when I put them on (this doesn’t happen with my athleta elation tights)."
3.0,These are 52mm not 48mm width.
3.0,"I love the fabric but the sewing was very poorly done. the spilt in the back of the jacket was pulled up by the inside lining which resulted a deformed look in the back of the jacket. I am a seamstress and therefore made the adjustment, Over all this jacket could have receive a 4-5 if the sewing was better"
3.0,Slippers cute but the thread is coming apart
3.0,Super cute - but sized way too small
3.0,"The necklace is pretty and is going to serve its purpose, but I specifically chose this necklace because the picture showed it as a light blue, which is the recipient’s favorite color, and in reality it’s a dark blue almost purple for the heart. There were similarly colored necklaces from other sellers for less, so I feel like the photos were misleading."
3.0,"My nephew loves it because it's pokemon, but the material is very thin. we live in NY so i wanted a heavy sweatshirt for winter. im disappointed. he's not. lol"
3.0,Good dress sized up but still too tight couldn’t eat if I wore it .
3.0,Had to return.  Medium was too snug and too short.
3.0,I wore it everyday for 3 weeks then one day it snapped off while I was cleaning.
3.0,Came with hole in pocket but other than that I love it
3.0,"Sleeves are shorter than expected and sizes do run small, I ordered a size up, but I guess I needed to order 2 sizes up!"
3.0,It was too small for what I needed. But seemed like it would work fine if you needed a smaller bag
3.0,I got this for my daughter. She said it doesn't make your makeup go on that we'll and it makes it look blotchy.but it is really smooth gliding across your skin.
3.0,The zipper broke on the first day.
3.0,"I bought this hat for myself to wear while working in the yard.  It has a mesh top, which I was looking forward to for keeping me cooler while still shading my eyes.  The design is fashionable.  Upon receipt, it seemed all was in order.  However, I will say, the lining on the inside of the hat (where the tag and the elastic are) was sewn in sideways.  Not a huge deal, because who really cares where the tag is as long as it doesn't show, I guess.  Also, there is a bendable wire that runs around the ""bill"" of the hat that allows you to adjust the shape.  The one I got was broken and the wire was sticking out of the fabric.  It was sharp.  I was able to push it back into the fabric, but it still pushes out occasionally. I did find that it does seem to be a bit big on me and the wind blows it off all of the time, if it fit a little more snugly, than I don't think that would be a problem.  Ultimately, I didn't return it because I have used it.  I plan to continue to use it because it does block the sun from my face adequately, but the quality isn't all that great.  It was an inexpensive hat so I guess you get what you pay for."
3.0,I slept in it!
3.0,They’re just what I expected minus an arm or two on a pair.
3.0,Heel loose and toe pointy. Bigger issue: new amazon return policy. Was charged for a shipping box. Amazon shipped multiple items in one box. Returns NOT free.
3.0,vwry big lenses
3.0,"Very small buttons, but will do the job as a costume add on!"
3.0,"My hubby is 6'3&#34; and according to other reviews, I ordered him an XL to gain extra length.  When the bottoms arrived, I compared them against a pair of LT PJ bottoms that he has.  The length was perhaps an inch shorter than  his current PJs.  I have returned the FoL PJ bottoms as he hates 'flood pants;'.  Other than that, the PJ bottoms appeared to be decent quality for the money.  Too bad FoL does not sell tall PJ bottoms..."
3.0,The gloves are very smart looking and soft and warm but the white stitching on top is slowly but surely coming out. Poor stitching job. Would not recommend.
3.0,Very thin and flimsy. Does not fit well and I consider it a waste of money. I have not used them.
3.0,Item is nice but ruined the way it was packed the wrinkles ruins the vest<br />A shame to do that
3.0,"Love the denim color to go with jeans. They are smaller and shorter than expected. I wanted crew socks and these are looking more like anklets, they are so short."
3.0,The fit was good. Got an XXL for my tall but skinny 10 year old.<br /><br />The hoodie is sewn on inside out and is too short to be functional. The shoulders come up off his shoulders when he puts the hood on.<br />As the color is fairly similar to the outside color I am not going to bother with exchanging it but quality control needs to improve!
3.0,Fits good but  is not a good quality dress. Its plain and not really  a party dress for  fancier functions but I'd  where it to a dinner out  to casual  restaurant.
3.0,"The fabric feels cheap and it is oversized so I was swimming in it. I typically wear a medium and this medium was huge on me, maybe a small would have fit and looked better. The fabric feels way more polyester than a cotton/poly blend. The lace detail is nice but really all it is going to do is showcase my bra straps and its not quite pretty enough to save an otherwise meh shirt."
3.0,I love these but needed to order the next size
3.0,Very cute color and was so excited but Is completely sheer and see through. Also runs small order 2 sizes up if you want it loose.
3.0,"Nice, light weight multifocal reading glasses, but both lens have several small scratches on them. The scratches do not impair my vision, but who wants to pay for a damaged product. I like the frame enough to rebuy them, but there are no more in stock."
3.0,"It’s small, at least for me. If you carry some extra weight in the stomach area I would probably order a size up. I hope to fit well in it soon so I don’t plan on returning it because it is pretty cute otherwise. Side note, the material feels a bit unexpected but it’s not necessarily bad."
3.0,"They are super cute and seem comfortable to my daughter, but whyyyy is the ankle so tight?  Toddlers are usually chubby, and my girl isn't even that chubby compared to some kids, but the zipper barely goes up over her socks.<br /><br />I got size 4.5 M and they are actually slightly big in the foot part but I worry she will grow out of the ankle part before she really fits the shoe part. We sometimes leave the zipper open a bit and they still stay on.<br /><br />I wish more reviews mentioned this. Maybe that's why the price was so low."
3.0,I order an XL and I'm normally a M.<br />I still was not able to fit in it.<br />It's supper tiny.
3.0,"Meh.  We wanted a shirt with all of the princesses on it to wear to Disney World this summer.  It'll work for wandering around the park and for playing in.  Don't love it, don't hate it.  Not sure I'd pay the same price a second time around.  I've found shirts of the same or better quality for much less in stores."
3.0,I'm loosing weight to fit them...
3.0,"The stress is pretty cute and comfortable. Not too short as I am 5’3 and wore to work. Unfortunately, the stitching  ripped after 2nd wash and air dry 😞."
3.0,Soft and comfy but looks like pajamas so I will not wear it out of the house.
3.0,"I whish Amazon would pay more attention to details, when a customer pays $6K for a product. Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.<br /><br />The bad and very bad:<br /><br />1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.<br /><br />2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.<br /><br />3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K<br /><br />4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...<br /><br />5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!<br /><br />6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.<br /><br />7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.<br /><br />2. Automated diamond search system is very good.<br /><br />3. Looks like the craftsmanship is good."
3.0,The dress was  nice but the fabric is a little too heavy for summer. The bottom doesn't have a slit so the thicker cotton fabric traps heat around your legs. This would be a good transition to spring dress.
3.0,Relatively small
3.0,"i like the shirt and accurate to picture. comfortable. just need to order smaller, don't follow size chart, go smaller"
3.0,"These are great for a glow-in-the-dark party! They are fun, but at least 8-10 of them were already on and did not work."
3.0,"Soft lightweight hoodie. Gave 3 stars only because the color pictured is not accurate. Its a much lighter grey, I wanted the darker color but will have to settle. Size is accurate,  good quality hoodie."
3.0,It's a little hard to put.
3.0,"These were great for the first 2 weeks. Then a lens popped out, and I discovered that the frame had cracked across the top. Unfortunate since I really can see with them. I'd be willing to pay more for higher quality, but not a bunch more since I don't need them very often. If you're in the same situation, you might want to get a few pairs while keeping your durability expectations low."
3.0,Runs pretty big.
3.0,"These shoes were as expected as far as quality goes. They are play shoes so obviously they are made all out of plastic except for the bow at the top. The heel is very small, maybe like a 1/4 of an inch, I liked that because kids are less likely to fall and twist their ankles. I would have given this the full 5 stars except for one detail that was a big deal for me. The suggested age is 3-6 years so I got this for my 5 year old daughter, she wears size 10, which I think is pretty average for her age and these did NOT fit her. They fit my 2 year old daughter better and she's a 5 1/2. It would have been helpful to have an actual size on there, which I think would be around a 6 or 7. If you are getting this for a 2-3 year old it is perfect, not any older."
3.0,leggings came in good shape but I would recommend going a size down. I got a medium but they are too large and i have to pull them up a lot.
3.0,"The top is pretty and the color is beautiful. It did not fit me well, the neck line was crooked from one side and it seemed like it was just pulling upwards"
3.0,This product was used to make charm/zipper pulls for a women's retreat.  The charms worked well.  They can break if too much pressure is applied while attaching them to a ring or something.
3.0,I really liked this watch band. it fit well and was cute. I took it off to take a shower and the band broke :(
3.0,Charms are very cute however I have had to glue 3 jewels back on already with e6000 because they keep falling off definitely need to be reinforced
3.0,the color is alot brighter and runs a little small
3.0,There is not a nose rest and the mask last actually a little wider than it appears but it still look great!
3.0,High quality. Lots of options. Makes my head hot though.
3.0,The jacket itself has a lot of potential however it seems to run small. I can't actually button the large at the bust area.
3.0,"This outfit is adorable, the top is tight and short for our 11 yr. Old. The skirt is short, would need tights, little big in waist, but our girl is thin. Would LOVE this in bigger size, but we bought the largest. Granddaughter very disappointed."
3.0,"My boyfriend didn't want to wear it, but when he did he said it was comfortable and not annoying. It helped with snoring for a few nights."
3.0,Pretty earring but they are pretty big.
3.0,Knives are sharp for being plastic
3.0,Nice romper! A bit too small
3.0,"Super cute...BUT the size is a bit odd. I ordered the 3-6 month size for our 3 month old and it definitely is too big. He most likely wont fit it until 5-6 months, and we have a long & lean baby. Also, the shirt and shorts look like they’ll fit at different times, as the shirt is big (long), and the shorts are smaller. We’ll see when he can actually fit them both. Other than that, it’s super cute and decent quality."
3.0,"Don't fit my ear holes, too thick for regular old-school earlobe piercings. Description should include this information. I wouldn't call them delicate, pretty heavy!"
3.0,Decent for the money. Did not return. Ran kind of large.
3.0,Pretty small.
3.0,its a little bet more the size requested
3.0,"The design is nice and the pants fit nicely, but the construction and materials may not last more than one season."
3.0,I appreciate the craftsmanship however the photo here is misleading. This product doesn't have a gloss or shine finish. Great price however they cost more to finish yourself.
3.0,It's a bit fitted but all in right places.<br />Not suitable for the well hung.
3.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): I agree with another reviewer that this dress is not the most flattering for someone with an apple shape.  After having two kids I have some tummy ""fluff"" and this dress unfortunately emphasizes that.  I wore my usual size (10) and it was very clingy in all the wrong places.  I like the fabric (stretchy and soft) and the overall design of the dress, but it's just not for my figure.  I either need to put on a pair of spanx to help flatten the tummy area, or try a size 12 to see if a looser fit would look better."
3.0,Runs small go one size bigger then your regular size.
3.0,On the smaller side- tight on the kids heads
3.0,Material is very cheap and has like a slit under the dress. Just don't like how it was made.
3.0,Very nice... but to small.  order bigger size... very nice product.
3.0,Super cute and pretty good quality but it didn’t fit right and was very uncomfortable
3.0,"Super cute, but runs extremely small."
3.0,Very pretty but sending back too heavy.
3.0,"Very thin, haven't worn during a real downpour yet so not sure how well it will protect as it's very very thin.  Nice hood and pockets."
3.0,LOOKS LIKE WHAT I PAID FOR IT
3.0,This was a last minute buy and it was for my sister. I did go one size up because I guided myself with the measurements and I'm glad I did. I wanted to give her a little bit of room just incase it ran small. Good material not see through. I can describe it as a thick cotton t-shirt material. Not a fancy dress but casual fun one.
3.0,"One of the masks is great and one is not because it stretches the wrong way - weird!  Because the one does not stretch the correct way, it is hard to get on and it too tight on the nose."
3.0,Broke after a couple weeks but you get what you pay for
3.0,Para trabajo en una bodega fría pero no cumplió la función  aun sentía demasiado frio
3.0,"had previously purchased the navy blue and the charcoal gray ones they were both a little bit heavier , the black ones are a little bit on the thin side"
3.0,"My wife really enjoys them, they fit well"
3.0,"Feels super comfy, but too tight around my waist. It shows every lump in my tummy area."
3.0,"I originally said that this watch must not have been an eco-drive because it required a battery.  The seller contacted me and assured me it was indeed an eco drive.  But there was a second reason why i returned the watch.  I am a small man with small wrists and this particular watch looked too large for my body.  It covered my entire wrist and didn't look good.  I suppose I was wrong about the watch not being eco-drive, but that was not the only reason I returned it."
3.0,The padding inside is bumpy and ridged padding and keeps moving around.
3.0,Much larger than I anticipated (probably should've paid attention to the measurements) which makes it seem gaudy. Shipping was fast tho.
3.0,"Well, the ring is beautiful but it arrived in a smashed box, so the ring is bent. It also seems to be larger than size 9 stackables that I wsnted to wear it with.it ms like a size 10.<br />I believe I will return this ring for a smaller, not bent, version of the same ring."
3.0,Light weight however very small and tight. Too small for 5yr old
3.0,ran pretty small
3.0,i thought they would be shinnier....but love the form of this earing. Big enough for grown ups....
3.0,"The material was thicker than I expected and the color greener than the blue in the picture.  Nice cropped cardigan though, but not the highest quality material and stitching."
3.0,It's got a very long handle so easy to push at the airport. However the computer sleeve is too small for my 14 inch computer. It does fit underneath the airline seats well
3.0,The neck is extremely wide.
3.0,The phrase &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; comes to mind.  About the same quality as $10 glasses you find at the drugstore.
3.0,As other reviews have noted this looks much less cute in reality than it does on the model. I wanted to love it but it was very unflattering on.
3.0,these things are good assuming you don't sweat too much then they tend to loose suction
3.0,Hard for my blind Mom to find the correct button.
3.0,sent back too small
3.0,"👍 The frame is quality, stylish, fits well<br /><br />👎 I’ve got many pairs of readers, different brands, and sadly the lenses on these kinda suck. Some distortion"
3.0,Super tight and bulky. There’s no give to these.
3.0,Love love love this suit but only buy it if you have a small chest anything over a C and your screwed trust me
3.0,they were much bigger than I expected
3.0,In love with the charms nice size but some came broken ☹ I definitely didn't like that other then that the rest were fine
3.0,"I like the bag, but it is already coming apart."
3.0,i thought this was going to be smaller. it is like a brick resting on my arm. otherwise it is a nice watch for the cost.
3.0,"The prongs came silver, not black.  Thankfully it was a gift and the recipient didn't mind, or notice.  If it shows all black, they should come all black."
3.0,Hat ripped at the seam after wearing it one time.
3.0,"I was led to believe these were earrings and advertised as &#34;Danglers&#34; (Plural). I ordered the item(s) and only ONE, piece arrived nicely gift wrapped. I ordered a second time to make my intended gift a pair of earrings and this order was cancelled due to credit card inconsistency? Payment worked the first time so here I am perplexed with half an  earring gift set."
3.0,The product is awesome. Great quality and super cute. IT took forever to get to me though.
3.0,The shirt is more appropriate for the summer. Not a big fan of the fabric for my son. The bottoms however are great. Fit very well.
3.0,"Got these for my CDO brother (OCD in the proper order) who cannot allow shoes on the stairwell of his house. They are a great novelty, they slip off, move around, are slippery on carpet(!), and are an absolute pain to reset for next use. He now only uses them if he forgot something upstairs and doesn’t want to take off his shoes."
3.0,Bought this as part of a Christmas present for my 5yr old. The design of Sonic is really nice and I like thst its designed on both sides but the material looks very cheapy and not very comfortable and it looks small. We will see once he opens.
3.0,It was broken so it was returned.
3.0,"Wisth narrower than expected'; otherwise, just fine."
3.0,"I ended up returning this dress but it wasn't terrible. The fabric was a nice quality, heavy but not hot feeling. print was cute for summer but as a short person at 5'2&#34; the pockets hit me at the widest part of my hips and just made me look that much bigger. If it didn't have pockets i probably would have kept the dress and just had it hemmed."
3.0,"the light is horrible because in complete darkness you cant even see the whole screen. the water resistance on the version i got is not good, the most you can do with it is wash dishes. the screen is very easy to read tho. i like that it shows the day and date to."
3.0,Not big fan . They shrink like crazy after wash.waist area got really wierd too.
3.0,fits alright but the eyes look all funky when it's on your head. i don't wear it.
3.0,Was to big.but nice colors.
3.0,Quality is good but they are too big for my two tweed jackets.  With a caliper I measured them at 23.2 mm and 16.2 mm.
3.0,This material is very thin and not stretchy like a regular swimsuit. There isn't any double layering in the crotch area. The stitching of the thin straps to the thin material makes me nervous that they will eventually tear off. Very disapointed.
3.0,"These are very pretty earrings , but much smaller than the picture leads you to believe. Maybe there was a size in the description that I missed. Be sure to read the description."
3.0,Fast shipping and great size
3.0,They seem to be of good quality but are much too small for most glasses. Best news with reading glasses when one is frankly less likely to need sunglasses at all
3.0,The price of fabric that goes under the back that laces up was too small. If I had ordered a bigger size the dress would be too bid in the bust.
3.0,THE FIT IS VERY NICE. i JUST DON'T LIKE THAT THE TOP OF THE PANTS FALL UNDER BELLY WHEN WORKING OU.
3.0,"This scarf was much smaller than I expected both in width and length (or circumference, since the ends are connected). If you're planning to use this around the neck only, then it might work out for you. But if you want to drape it in any way over your shoulders, maybe it's not what you're looking for.<br /><br />In addition, the material was not at all what I was expecting. It is similar to that of a swimsuit or leotard, stretchy and printed on one side of an opaque white background (visible white when stretched out). Again, perhaps this might be fine for some, but it was not what I was expecting or looking for.<br /><br />I gave 3 stars because the pattern is pretty and the price is low."
3.0,"I am typically a size 7.5 to 8. I am currently pregnant and my feet are a bit swollen but have been fitting in my size 8 shoes. I ordered these initially in a size 9 and they were way too small. I ended up giving them to a friend who wears a size 6 and she said they fit just right. I reordered these in a size 11 and they just fit my feet. Very snug and soft. However, the color of the second ordered pair is not the same as the first pair I ordered. The size 11 looks like the photo. The size 9 looked like the photo but the furry part was much darker. No big deal as I still like them, but it is just odd that they are different. They are cheap so I guess you get what you pay for but definitely size up if you are going to purchase these."
3.0,The seams were already tearing apart when pulled out the pack. I measured to wear a medium but a small would have been better.
3.0,These are very pretty and work well with my phone. My only problem with them is that they don’t keep my hands warm.
3.0,"It's pretty and I like the material (it's not as scratchy as a lot of costumes), but it runs SMALL. I ordered both the 9/10 and the 11/12 size for my 9-year-old daughter (average height, below average weight for her age), and the 9/10 is definitely too small and the 11/12 is shorter than she'd like."
3.0,"I ended up returning the two items I got, though there wasn't really anything wrong with them. I just felt they looked a little less hip in person. Geometry Print J was problematic because it doesn't stay on your shoulders no matter what. But photos show more than what I would be able to explain so here you go."
3.0,Love these boots but cannot figure out the sizes...ordered my normal size 10 and they were too big. Ordered next size smaller 9.5 and way too small.  So disappointed. Cool boots. Anyone else have this problem?  Almost wonder if the 10's were marked wrong.  I've now ordered 4 pairs and can't seem to find any consistency in sizing.
3.0,Cute but buy a size or two up
3.0,LOVED the earrings but they did not come with backs! Is that normal?
3.0,"Such a cute top but it was REALLY short. I wish it was longer, then I for sure would have kept it."
3.0,Nice set - but runs small.
3.0,"Mine came broken. Very cheap chain but beautiful pendant. Plus the smaller chain had twists that I couldn’t remove. So im going to keep the pendant, throw the chain away and just get a different chain."
3.0,"The sizing is perfect, quality is good, shirt is very cute. But it doesn’t fit as the picture described, it is not an off the shoulder shirt. The neck is entirely to small but it’s still cute either way."
3.0,They Zipper doesn't work very well & gets stuck easily. Also There isn't many places to put any type Cards. Other wise it's really Cute.
3.0,FYI:  Have to be assembled.
3.0,I returned it only because I didn’t like how I looked in it but other than that it was a pretty dress!
3.0,"Nice pattern, washes well. Does not discolor. But its very long, and tight"
3.0,"Battery soon died of natural causes......lolol, very attractive, can probably get another battery for it, just haven't taken the time to look for a compatible battery."
3.0,The top half of the dress is a bit too wide and the quality of material used was too shiny. It looks more like a nightgown than a dress to go to an event. I would wear this if I was having a romantic dinner in- as if it was a sweet and sexy nightgown. If it was more Matte and less shiny I would wear it out.
3.0,Way bigger than expected this is not true to size
3.0,"These fleece lined leggings had a nice feel to them but were much thinner than I’d hoped.  I’ve ordered several pairs of fleeced lined leggings this winter and these are by far the thinnest, without any sort of compression to them.  Maybe good for slightly cool temps of spring, but I was hoping for something more appropriate for outdoor exercise in winter."
3.0,Seems a little cheap.
3.0,It's a bit thin but it is cute
3.0,"I am 5'10"" with a full bust. I sized up but it was still too small on top. Smelled like skunk spray. The weight of the material was more appropriate for a blouse than a dress."
3.0,"Items came as described, although the quality of yarn is a little less than comparable items. I ordered this set and another single beanie from another seller and the &#34;real&#34; C.C. brand was much softer and larger. Overall, these are a great purchase for the price, basically 2 for the price of one of the others. You get what you pay for, so if you're looking for a softer, higher quality item, go for another brand. Otherwise, these do the job."
3.0,"They shift down while walking :/ I constantly have to pull them up. They are really stretchy, I’ll have it up to you if that’s good or bad. I am very used to wearing too big sweat pants though. So maybe I’m just not used to stretchy leggings 😗"
3.0,It's soft touch to the skin.
3.0,The bottom seems small for the size.  The top is fine
3.0,The shoes are really cute and my 3 yr old nephew thought they were cool. The charger cord that came with them is split so you can charge both shoes at once but one side of ours doesn't work so we will have to charge 1 shoe at a time.  I think that will get annoying and we'll probably end up just not using the lights.
3.0,I should have known better but thought it would be a cute gift.  Not very sturdy and to be honest looked like a toy.
3.0,Great value. Use it for dog walking in the frozen north aka Connecticut. Would give five stars if lining were not so loose. Almost feels like lining is separate glove and chore to pull on.
3.0,Little hard to put on...
3.0,"I LOVED this jumpsuit. It fits very large though. I’m typically a small and this small fell right off of me. I was able to take in the top and it worked -  for the price I had to try. I took about 3 inches in on the top and just left the bottom flowy. I got SO many compliments. However, if you are small chested and can’t do the alterations yourself, this may not be the jumpsuit for you."
3.0,They  just alright
3.0,"i liked it but it fit me like a night gown.  i ordered based on the reviews and could have seriously gone down 2 sizes.  this sat at my knees like a dress.  this is cuter than pictured and i really liked the lace-type styled detail in the front.  The sleeves were a lil grandma, but overall this is a cute piece. but must return it bc it's just too long"
3.0,"I like it, but it gets caught to all my little arm hairs and it’s uncomfortable when they’re pulled."
3.0,If you buy this make sure you down size.
3.0,Good quality material but didn’t work for me so I’m returning
3.0,Seem like what I wanted. I guess you have to trim them to fit though.
3.0,Not what I expected.. it's more yellow then orange and its stretchy material..  But still cute..
3.0,Get one size bigger the jacket run one size smaller
3.0,"Its okay.  The gold looks pretty cheap, but it is still pretty cute.  I love the layered look.  Have already wore it to work.  Also, when I got it, it took me 10 minutes just to untangle it!!!  But, still... for the price, it is not a bad purchase."
3.0,Earrings are a different shade of gold from the rest of the jewelry and started turning colors after only being worn once
3.0,Ordered a size bigger and still somewhat small.  Otherwise a nice product.
3.0,"After trying on 4 pairs I have tossed them out. No matter how I tried, every pair ripped while putting on. Its as though the had been stored in a very hot place. The gloves were difficult to take out of the box and felt brittle. There was no flex or give to them. Very dissatisfied."
3.0,Didn’t expected what I thought it would be
3.0,"The design and color is prefect, but the material has no stretch to it and the size runs too small."
3.0,"very small, but nice"
3.0,Smaller than expected. Good quality. Love Amanda.
3.0,"These socks are ok.  I was disappointed that I only got 6 different styles out of the 12 pair.  Unless you're giving them away as gifts to different people, I can't imagine while you'd need 2 pair of the same style.  Otherwise, I think they're just fine."
3.0,"Two of the eight are defective. Not worth returning since the others accomplish what I needed. They were a little smaller than I was imagining, but putting two together fixes that."
3.0,Too big and did not really  like the fabric thought.<br />But the seller is great and refunded me.
3.0,"Fit nicely and are comfortable, but they are paper-thin.<br /><br />I expect these to wear out within a month or two."
3.0,Cheap jewelry get what you pay for.
3.0,Fits nice as pictured but awkward neck piece
3.0,This ring is at least a size 8 and is not easily adjustable by hand. We will try to adjust with a pair of pliers.
3.0,Don’t really like how the lace attaches to the bottom of the sweatshirt but it’s a cute sweatshirt.
3.0,"It's a cute backpack. The material might not last too long, but it is okay."
3.0,bottoms fit perfect top couldn’t even get over my head
3.0,"Had to keep taking batteries in and out, in order for it to work."
3.0,Tarnished after 3 wears.
3.0,I'm a slim guy and the shirt was rather tight on me and short in the sleeves. You might want to consider a larger size if you plan on purchasing.
3.0,"Aww, I really really REALLY wished that I could keep this dress! The color and patterns were great, size fit fine, length was perfect (below knee), had pockets(!) and the fabric was thick enough and no see through... BUT the seam around the lower chest was cut so thick and rubbed my skin. After 10-15 min, it started hurting, I couldn't wear it anymore. If they could have trimmed it shorter or somehow flatten it, I would have bought the entire collection! So sad!"
3.0,"These are nice and fit but they are shorts, not culottes. Culottes have a front panel making them look like a short skirt from the front."
3.0,Doesn’t deliver the heartwarming feeling your hoping for kinda weird giving this to my wife honestly lol like “ you a little crazy behind that wheel be careful” plus she has anxiety and I don’t think this helped
3.0,It was a great shirt.  Vivid design but ran small.
3.0,"Received a month after ordering. Out of 40 pcs 10 were nonfunctional. But, the ones working are good."
3.0,But nice material - just runs small
3.0,I ordered this so it could be cool while nursing my baby but it doesn’t really unbutton & the sleeves are more like cap sleeves :(
3.0,It was thin material but it was the right size. It’s a good copy of Made With Love “Archie” it is not good quality fabric but if it’s for a photos it would work. It’s not as flattering in person. The customer service has been really great. They respond and were able to help me return it since I ordered a standard dress size. It’s the affordable option if you want a higher end design. It’s what you pay for. The original dress at the bridal shop was $2300 so if you have a Vegas wedding or something lol
3.0,"The face is ridiculously large; therefore, it will not look natural if that is the look that you are going for, otherwise it's a decent mask for my purposes."
3.0,Washed it gentle cycle colD water laid flat to dry came out nice except the cute little diamond on zipper gone!! For the price of this sorry no thanks it’s the little things like that that make me buy one this expensive thinking it’s going to be better than my $25 dollar ones..NOT<br />Medium
3.0,"Love this, but it’s too big. Tried to shrink it in the wash. Didn’t work"
3.0,Broke within two days of having it
3.0,This was adorable at first until it got dirty and then I tried to wash it and it's made of cardboard covered in cloth obvioisly because now it's all mis-shapen.  Wouldn't let me charge my phone unless I slid it out of the case.
3.0,It does it’s job. Nothing special about the shirts. It’s not high quality but works. Don’t expect for these shirts to last beyond a year.
3.0,Product is sized smaller than average and material seemed a little thin
3.0,"It’s ok, basic material. But again I got it for my 10yr old. So it was nice for her to mess with"
3.0,Nice but it looks inexpensive
3.0,they leak
3.0,The font started peeling even with gentle washing a no drying. First of this brand to do this.
3.0,The keychain is cute. But the colors all ran together so it doesn’t look like the image shown.
3.0,"There is no way to adjust the part of the protector. It is not suitable for people who are 5.8 feet, and it is more suitable for people who are more than 6.2 feet"
3.0,Looked more like a pj top on me. I'm short so maybe that's why...material was nice and comfortable though
3.0,Fit was a little too boxy for my liking
3.0,I ordered a large and it was super tight. Still super cute!
3.0,Great gift for my wife but way too small / short
3.0,My feet were hurting after 4 hours while wearing these. They are so cute though.
3.0,I didn't know the Eagle is in the front.  Wish it was imprinted vs a sticker.  However its a nice gift.
3.0,The short was looks good but to small for me
3.0,"It meets my needs as I expected, or I would have returned it."
3.0,"It's super cute, very stretchy and comfy- most of the time.<br />The way the band was made, it has one end with a flap and that flap is constantly brushing against my skin and it's irritating.<br />However, I realized if I place that part on the outer part of my wrist (top of the watch) it's not as bad.<br />Also don't like that the pins fall out, my other bands don't. Just a little annoyance of having to search for the pins.<br />It's the little things."
3.0,"First off, I'd like to say that it really bothers me that Amazon allows people to rate an item who are not verified customers and leave no comment. That's the case with this dress. Second, the dress had no measurements for the sizes and after a couple of attempts to get answers I took a chance and purchased it. I decided to buy a large and although it fit, it was not oversized as I'd hoped (see model). Third, I wash my garments before wearing and in this case I did not put it in the dryer in case it shrank. Upon smoothing it out I noticed a hole in the front panel. It's not that big but it shouldn't be there.<br />Still, I like this dress."
3.0,if you have much of an arch to your foot you will find the instep is tight
3.0,"I love that it is soft and has my favorite villain on it, but I SHOULD have purchased a small. The large is to BIG for my face."
3.0,"I wear size 7.5 to 8 in women's shoes.  I bought men's size 6.5.  These sandals are heavy-duty (and heavy in weight) but fairly comfortable.  After less than a month of wearing them a few hours a day, the straps have stretched (and I suppose the soles have flattened a bit; I'm not obese), and the sandals now flop around as I walk.  Size 6 would have been better.  The upper soles still have a good texture."
3.0,Not extremely durable.  Seams are coming apart.
3.0,"Its a cute hoodie dress. But, it only provides minimal warmth. When I bought i was hoping for a warmer item. Daughter loves it but its a fall/spring item.<br />Also, it has ears. As though it is a bear or something. Not sure of any depictions of mermaids with animal ears"
3.0,Color on the heart come off just not what I expected especially have it less then a week
3.0,Beautiful--but hundreds of little sequin pearls come undone and rain.  Heavily dyed.  Must be hand washed.
3.0,Super cute leggings but probably the itchiest I’ve ever worn...
3.0,Very comfortable and stylish however it is not very durable. I have only had it 1 month and wear it daily until tonight when I noticed the rubber was breaking off the bar.
3.0,I received the shirt and it was way too short. I tried reading the reviews and what other people said and it's still small. The shirt is only for the bar and club. I wouldn't wear it anywhere else (if it would have fit).
3.0,I work in marine Law enforcement and this key was showing rust within a week. But other than that it's great.  If you work on the water though you might wanna coat it or something
3.0,Its a beautiful skirt but I could only get it o my thighs. i ordered it larger than my usual size too.
3.0,Was extremely big and didn’t fit my head at all. Made my head look super big:(
3.0,"Does not feel very supportive especially for fuller bust. The front needs to be higher, cuts at angle which causes spillage....for the price its just ok, not sure if I will be keeping"
3.0,Es muy oscuro el ser yo las uso de noche ¿me gustaría saber si el sudor las despinta o se le va el color
3.0,"Definitely cuter in person.  I wanted an inexpensive pair of booties to get through the tail end of winter when my two year old had a growth spurt.  I kind of wish I got them sooner.<br />Update.  We've had these boots for a couple of weeks.  The black ""leather"" is chipping off all around the toes.  Also, the zipper keeps flipping over sideways and getting stuck.  I knew they were inexpensive, but I didn't realize how cheaply they were made.  She doesn't even wear them all the time.  They should be holding up better than this."
3.0,This dress is very pretty BUT it fits a lil weird for me. First off I don't know why there two holes on the sides of the dress I know you have to use one to put the strap in but the other is useless and the top part of the dress fits too small in the chest area and too big in the shoulder area. So what I'll be doing is getting it altered in the top part so it has a better fit and I also would have liked the dress to be a bit longer on the bottom. For reference; I am 5'4 and 125 lbs. I ordered a size medium. I wish I could have ordered a size large. To have a more comfortable fit but I'm sure I still would have had to alter it. Which would have been fine with me.
3.0,Not cut true to size.
3.0,"The descriptions says this dress is 39"". It measures only 34"". Five inches makes a HUGE difference on a tall young lady. Too bad, because it was very pretty."
3.0,"Not what I expected, but they are ok."
3.0,"This fit much smaller than the size I ordered.  Too bad, it's very nice quality.  Rated it low because the sizing was way off."
3.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered a size big - I'm a medium and I ordered a large.  These sweat pants are very comfortable, however there are three things you should be aware of - this is why only three stars:<br />1) As mentioned - the sizing is way off - order bigger than you think.<br />2) A minor thing - these grab pretty tightly around your ankles - doesn't bother me, but it may bother some<br />3) Be very careful when you wash them the first time - they bleed dark blue like crazy.  We washed them on the cold water setting, with a non-bleach detergent, but they bled on other clothes - badly.  I'm hoping subsequent washes won't be a problem, but for at least the first wash - be careful!<br />Other than that - they're comfortable, have lots of pockets, and I think look good."
3.0,"I love the style, but it was too tight in the chest."
3.0,The good dress but not good size. I ordered L but too small ((( I need to return it(
3.0,"Cute top, the bottoms-no so much.  My daughter loves the top so we kept it for her to wear with other bottoms.  The bottoms look liked stupid like a diaper."
3.0,"The style didn't fit me like the picture. I think if you are slimmer it would, but I am 5'2 140 lbs so the placement wasn't for me. That being said, the fabric was nice, it looks professional and I have bought about 10 Homeyee dresses so I would definitely recommend their clothes."
3.0,"Says 18 caret? But insert is black too! Will have to give as Christmas gift! Allergic , have to have 14 caret plus?😞"
3.0,This watch got the job done plain and simple. But I could not hold up to the training I was going through. I broke and ripped so I salvaged it with a new band.
3.0,Loved it and got plenty of compliments before it broke
3.0,The length of the socks were a bit shorter than described but they were semi durable for a couple uses but developed holes quickly .
3.0,"The ""progressive"" lens did not work for me.  I would have wanted a large enough clear lens to be able to wear these glasses other than for reading or computer work.  I hated to return the glasses because the frame was so very attractive!"
3.0,This one piece fits great and provides good coverage on the backside - the colors are bright and look just like the photo. The only thing I am not thrilled about is that the fabric on the inside feels a little rough against my skin.
3.0,"Not the best quality, but still cute"
3.0,Texting gloves have special material on the tips for working on screens.. these are a different knit.. not actually effective for texting. Otherwise they are nice looking.
3.0,It still doesn’t fit the way I want but they will do!
3.0,"I'm 5 ft 3 in and 120 pounds - I ordered the size small and it fit perfectly, but the dress is see through and too long to be flattering. The waist line falls at a really awkward place, above my actual waistline and too far below my bust. The dress fit, but I think it is made for a taller woman than I."
3.0,"Super cute, unfortunately not long lasting. Threw mine away after  month or so. The gold lining started to chip off."
3.0,Print doesn’t look great can’t tell what it is
3.0,It was pretty although the stone was white and did not reflect any other color. I was disappointed because I thought it was going to look more like an opal stone..
3.0,Great but small for original Large size
3.0,Disappointed to find out costume didn't have fluffy leg warmers. The costume showed up with some defects that I will have to fix  :(. For the price...definitely disappointed!
3.0,"I love the design, but the small fits like an extra small. I was able to wear it even though it was tighter than I usually wear t-shirts."
3.0,"Too big, not enough shape."
3.0,"These aren't really skinny as described, they are more of a straight-leg pant. That said, the color was rich and the fabric is thick. The fit was just off from what I expected."
3.0,I just wanted these to wear with leggings around the house in the winter and these do the job.
3.0,It's a little too big to use as a face mask I had to hem it  to tighten it up so would stay up on my face it's thin seems like polyester material
3.0,This is a very pretty dress.  It was very small in the top and way too big around the hips.
3.0,"Overall, an ok product. I just had trouble between the case and my wrist, the emergency call kept going off."
3.0,"The glasses were a little bit slanted but other than that, it's John Lennon style so for the price it's alright."
3.0,"Item didn't come with cords in the back to tighten, as shown in the picture and not as high quality as I expected."
3.0,"Product is made with high quality material and it's perfectly. However, the pockets arent sewn between the fabric so they stick out under the main layer making it look like you're wearing an inner tube."
3.0,It is a very cute hat and fits good but it makes me  itchy after a while . So maybe not the best hat to wear for longer periods of time or for people that have sensitive skin.
3.0,"I got this for a COVID19 safety mask, and it's see through. I appreciate the filler, but that's only for the section that has the insert. It's comfortable and easier to breathe through. That also means I cannot use this anywhere where I'll be anywhere close to people which would by why I bought it since my work had us come back into the office. I think if it got a second thin layer it would be safer in my opinion. I did love the graphic and the fabric texture."
3.0,I ordered a 2X size and runs like a medium. Not top happy with the size but the print looks like the one in the picture.
3.0,"It's cute, but doesn't lay flat I'm constantly trying to have it lay nicer, not really worth the annoyance. It tries to roll, not really the look I expected."
3.0,"The recipient who loves octopi seemed to like it.  But, I wasn't impressed. Nice long chain"
3.0,"El diseño es bonito y se siente cómodo. Solo que la tela es algo delgada, y se transparenta<br />Un poco"
3.0,"The price whs right but they fit very sloppy and not very warm. Also, the area about the pom-poms stays flapping down. I wear a 5-6 and bought a small, but they are huge."
3.0,"the dress was nice, but the loops that go around the buttons at the neck broke within the first 30 minutes of my daughter wearing it."
3.0,So it's cool that it's actually metal but it doesn't go on correctly. It works as a regular headband but that's not how she wears it. Wearing on my forehead is incredibly uncomfortable.
3.0,"I needed a slim wallet to keep in my pocket since it was inconvenient to carry a purse/bag with my new job. works for that, but that’s about it. inside lining is falling apart, and i’ve only had it for a few weeks. it’s definitely a get what you pay for situation, but when this one becomes unusable, i’ll definitely be splurging on my next wallet"
3.0,"To be fair, the top is very nice, the material is soft and it hangs nicely.  For me personally, it wasn't a good fit because it is a stretchy fabric...it clings more than I would like and is unflattering on my body."
3.0,When I'm using it I feel dizzy
3.0,"These are very cute slippers that look like they’re described. Great for flat surfaces that are not too slick, such as carpet. I did a great deal of research before settling on these as I wanted something with good grip. Sadly these aren’t it. My son looks like he’s walking on pillows on our hardwood floors, his gait is odd, and the absence of a full rubber sole means the grip isn’t great at all. This just has those little nubs, which aren’t very good. I’ve seen him sliding around on occasion. Certainly when running, which is most of the time for a 3-year old.<br /><br />The thick, cheap foam-like bedding means they don’t flex much and aren’t good for stairs at all. I would go as far as saying they’re dangerous on stairs. If this is only for school, say, with no stairs and limited running areas, they’re fine. If you have a home with stairs and running area, particularly with mostly hard floors, skip these and get something with a thinner sole made of rubber (not the nubs). Both of those factors will give the child much needed grip and safety."
3.0,Longer than expected. Tight at hips.
3.0,"First of all, you are not going to get the designs that you choose. Aside from that, the material is not very breathable, making head hot and hair stink after while. But they are cute. I use them to wrap around a high bun and it looks cute.  Good to throw on when you need a quick hairstyle."
3.0,More of a DEMI cup feel to it.
3.0,Cute dress I ordered two dresses and returned one both dresses had a issue with the button one was falling off. The other the button came off when I opened it it was being held on by one little string
3.0,Decent fit but a little tight
3.0,"Ordered a XL i’m 5’4 210 pounds. Liked the color, the material was cheap and I have a butt so the dress rose up shorter in the back than it did in the front. I returned it!"
3.0,"They're ok, I guess. The pad part is pretty much all rubber (unlike official PS4 thumbsticks, which are solid plastic with a rubbery coating). The only solid plastic part is the lower half. They seemed really nice at first, but now I can feel the edges starting to break already. If the pad part was solid, this wouldn't happen.<br /><br />These are also a very slight bit shorter than official PS4 thumbsticks. This wouldn't seem like a problem, but trying to put any other kind of 'cover' thumbpads on it results in the cover pad dragging against the controller because the thumbstick itself is just slightly shorter. This means once these thumbpads break there isn't really any option to continue on with caps or cover pads."
3.0,"Love the colors, it's beautiful. But the picture shows the length as mid thigh and it was actually mid calf."
3.0,The straps are pretty tight on top.
3.0,The bottom is ridiculously see through and the top is oddly fitting where it connects to the midsection. I'm going to sew those pieces down myself to make it more fitting. Also wearing my Spanx underneath to provide some coverage
3.0,"I have small wrists, so I like small watches. This one fits just  right and is comfortable and easy to read during the day. One of the reasons I bought this watch is because it has a light for night viewing. However, the light only illuminates about one third of the face, so you only see the hour. Also the control buttons are real small and hard to use while on your wrist. That is why I only gave this product 3 stars."
3.0,The colors are vibrant and these are definitely statement earrings. I personally just feel they look a little cheap and flimsy. Some of the threads stick out and were bent from delivery so it wasn't giving a clean look.
3.0,"Ugly material, noticeable zipper in BLACK, why would you create a hidden pocket and then make the zipper BLACK? ok thats dumb"
3.0,the cap is fine was just to big for my daughter the water got underneath it not protecting her hair from the water.
3.0,"Never came. However, I got the same ones from a friend and loved them."
3.0,Small & easy to break
3.0,"I first found this brand at TJMaxx and loved it.  I was excited to find them on Amazon, but the quality is not the same. The fit was fine but the fabric of these pants is more rough/lower quality then the ones I already own.  They are Ok, but I was dissappinted. I decided to return these."
3.0,"The dress is nice and fits as expected. The material is very thin, which for me means the dress won't last too long. I've worn it about 4x and the hems are beginning to unwind.<br /><br />For the price I can handle that + I expected it to be thin materials so had proper expectations.<br /><br />If you qant a dress that'll last many wears and washes, you'll want to look elsewhere BUT this is a cute dress to wear a few times."
3.0,"For the price, this was ok. It’s cute when you put it on but after owning it for a few months it’s pretty much falling apart. The quality of the materials is cheap and seems to stretch out so I have to increase to the next loop hole."
3.0,"I really like this bralette, it fits me well. Ive only had it for a few months and the seams are already ripping. Otherwise I really enjoyed it."
3.0,"I got these because I'm in front of my computer at work for 8+ hours a day. I don't seem to have any eye issues but wanted ti try these out because I figured these would be good for my eyes.<br /><br />They actually look sorta cool and my wife sorta liked it on me. The frames are very light and comfortable. They also won't break very easily as they are quite bendable. The lenses appear to be a yellow color with a light blue reflecrive but transparent coating.<br /><br />After even just a few minutes of use then removing the glasses, I can see how much blue light the monitors are emitting. I really don't know much about if that's really bad, etc.  They seem to be doing well, though I have an issue with the glasses. As some other reviews have stated, there is some glare. I could immediately tell that the glare was coming from inside the glasses. Light was coming through the lenses and bouncing off my eyes and back onto the lenses and back to my eyes. In other words, I can see my eyes as a reflection during the entire time of using it in front of the monitor. I notice if my screen is lighter in color, then the reflection is worse. When the screen is dark, then the reflection isn't too bad.<br /><br />I got these glasses at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I promise that it is honest and unbiased. If I experience anything different with this product, I will return to update my review."
3.0,"A bit more granny panty than expected.  Not horrible, but wouldn't buy them again."
3.0,It's tight around my tummy & the sleeves are long but I have short arms
3.0,"These were really cute, it took a long time to receive them. They did not update the delivery well. They also look smaller then they are. A bit big for a three year old. More like for a six or seven . But they are staying."
3.0,"Cheap looking and way bigger than you think. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, when it came I was very disappointed, I should have believed the reviews, I bought her something different after seeing it. When I showed it to her she decided to keep it but I have never seen her wear it."
3.0,"I am flat footed so my feet tend to hang over the sides, bit other reviews said these were wide. The are not. I'd say medium width. Otherwise, great Sandal, just didn't fit me."
3.0,"Sturdy & functional; works as advertised. Two nit-picky (that is to say 'ultra-minor') complaint: the hat part is thick, heavy fabric (contrary to the hat's intent) + the screws that hold the fan seem inappropriate (they do not recess flush with the plastic housing/flange). Those things aside, it made a cool gift...especially once I had an INTERNATIONAL RESCUE patch sewn onto it..!"
3.0,"This is a really nice dress.  It's the kind you can travel with and doesn't seem to hold wrinkles.  However, the size is very misleading.  The dress I ordered was an extra large and it is labeled extra large but it runs very small.  The design of the dress is the kind I love to wear but too bad I won't be able to wear this one because I really liked it."
3.0,looks so different than the picture.
3.0,Too small. 15” long 31” waist
3.0,These look great on. They are very light weight and fashionable. They do feel flimsy and a bit cheap.
3.0,Earrings look nice but it's a little heavy for my ears.
3.0,"I bought it for my son who is 9 yrs. old. I followed the suggested size for his age and got him 8-9 yrs old size. It fits somewhat small. The slippers covers his feet but no allowance. So sometimes, part of his foot sticks out.  I wish i ordered the next size up. I wanted to return it but my son already wants to wear it. The material is good. But i really wish it wasnt that small."
3.0,"I love a shirt with a unique pattern, and this shirt's geometric pattern is very unique that looks great with jeans or shorts.  With the makeup being 92.5% Cotton, 7.5% Spandex, it's very comfortable and seems to be very durable.  The body of the shirt fits okay.<br /><br />It's a loose fit, much like the description page says, which wouldn't be bad if it weren't for the sleeves.  The sleeves are huge; they are far bigger than 'loose fit.'  I'm hoping that it will shrink the more and more I wash/dry it, but as of now, it is not a shirt that I can wear in public or recommend to anyone that doesn't have large arms: it is just too big."
3.0,Not sure it didn’t fit
3.0,I bought it for church but it was a little too short.
3.0,"My wife loves it. Looks great, and the price is much better than the options available at the Apple Store."
3.0,"Pros:<br />Cheap.  These are a great deal considering the number you get and the price I paid (especially with Prime)<br />3-pack.  As you'll see in the cons, this is a huge pro to off-set the worst con I found.<br />Cute.  I actually think these are adorable.  I got a clear, pink, and gold sparkle set.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Length is too long.  Even at 8 months preggers, the bar is at least an inch too long.  They cannot be cut, despite the description.  If you cut them, you would need to add threading to the bar where you cut it to get the ball to stay on.  So, don't waste one by cutting it unless you have the ability to add threading to the bar.<br /><br />These will ghost you.  Seriously.  I was taking a shower when I realized that I no longer had a bar in my belly button.  After a quick search, I found the bar (still attached to the smaller ball) on the floor in the living room.  I still haven't found the larger ball and I have no idea how it could have come off.  I'd only had it in for a couple of weeks, so the threading should not have worn away that fast.  But, you'll note that I got three of these things, so I just put a new one in and moved on with my life.  If I wasn't so close to the end of needing them, I would have been more upset with the situation."
3.0,"I wear this watch for short periods of time. It looks great but I dont use it often as it is stainless steel. Nonetheless, the quality is ok and looks very nice when worn"
3.0,Perfect for my Halloween costume; but super chintzy.
3.0,The shoe is tight and stiff. I just wore them around the house for 2-3 weeks. Now they are fine and i can do my sports things wearing them. So it all worked out Love the design and color that attracted me to the shoe. They are well built.
3.0,Bought for my 8 year old and they are too small. Got a pair for my 6 year old and they fit her well.
3.0,"Ordered size according to chart, and it doesn't fit as expected, it's a little small.  May need to exchange."
3.0,Well made slipper. Order up a size
3.0,"These are very heavy earrings, so if you don't wear earrings on a regularly basis (which I do not,) these will quickly become uncomfortable while wearing.  I have yet to get through an entire day of wear with these.  They are, however, accurate depictions of the weeping angels, so I gave them 3 stars."
3.0,Lights up very well and is visible even in well lit interiors. Fit leaves a bit to be desired. The riged light up board squished uncomfortably into the nose. Was able to fix it by making a nose piece with some cardboard and foam to affix to it when in use.
3.0,El anuncio es talla M y se recibió talla m/m que es mas grande
3.0,Very light but adequate for the price.
3.0,"Pattern in real life is eh...and the fabric is ultra cheap.  Cut is nice.  Like another said, it feels like a cheap curtain."
3.0,cute and cost appropiate
3.0,The fabric is sheer and it is like a straight t-shirt- you’d definitely need a belt to make this a “dress”. Not my favorite purchase. :(
3.0,It’s way bigger than I thought
3.0,This is a very nice piece of clothing.  Warm and very comfortable and help in standing up better but not as well as I had hoped.  Was received in a very timely manner and well packaged.
3.0,Good fit but it is very thin and see through. One strap over the shoulder makes it hard to cover your chest on that side so be sure to wear a bathing suit under it.
3.0,It is ok . Material to hard.
3.0,This sweater is comfortable and looks good With tights or leggings.I like the batwing sleeves and blue color is great.
3.0,"well, for the price is fine but it came a lil small even though I'm a tiny person. 4.11&#34;"
3.0,"Pros:<br />1. As advertised, double thickness, solid parts including the clasp<br />2. Easy to install - make sur the silver “button” is facing your wrist<br />3. Even with the gold watch, the black clasps are presentable, if not stylish<br />Cons:<br />4. In spite of the “soft” description, the band is very stiff, but is getting better with use<br />5. My major complaint is the thickness of the band - it catches on everything. Not for everyday use, as I was expecting.<br /><br />If you want thick and stiff, this the band for you."
3.0,Too large... I gave it to my sister... She likes it.
3.0,"The print is adorable but they def. run small.  Also, they're see-through.  It's a pretty thick see through material.  I guess could go well at the beach with your bikini under-- like a cover up."
3.0,Beautiful but broke off and got lost within the first few hours of having it. I'm so sad!
3.0,It is a nice quality tank top but it runs small
3.0,"I really wanted to love this because my son has autism. However, I found that the item ran very small and I accidentally dried it, which made it even smaller (drastically so) and now I cannot wear it. I will have to find someone I can give it to. I may order a larger one and be careful not to dry it."
3.0,"Been wearing it for a while. Got as a replacement for my Wyze watch 47 because the stock band was giving me a rash. This band is comfortable and easy to put on and take off your wrist. Now the negatives. This was not that easy putting on the watch face. The little clasps that hold it on are in no way connected to the band itself. They will (and have) fly off if you don't get it connected right, be prepared to hunt them down if this happens. Now my biggest complaint, Its starting to rust. Yes RUST. It's very warm/hot where I live down south and causes sweat around the band area, as to be expected. This band is made for active watches, Samsung watch, apple watch and such for active people to track their progress. It should have had some kind of finish on it after they painted (yes the color is just painted on) it to prevent rusting. But it is very inexpensive, so I guess this was the area they shaved a few bucks on manufacturing costs. Just be aware of these short comings and reflect the price. It's been a couple months and it is only going to get worse so I'll be buying a new band soon, not sure it will be one of these again. Can't wear the neoprene/plasticy rubber ones either."
3.0,"I just reviewed another product that I ordered from the same company.  The backs on those earring were really bad.  These backs again were packed in a separate little package (same at the others).  These do fit the earrings but again it would have been so much better had they put the backs and fronts together to see if they fit properly.  Yes these earrings are bling, bling, but that's why I bought them."
3.0,Nice fabric but is snug through the bust and a little short.  Maybe a large would be better. Normally wear an 8 is dress size.
3.0,"I like the dress, but it fits too tight I wear size 12-14 and that what I ordered size 14 and was too tight can’t wear it. Sucks😞"
3.0,Color is not good.
3.0,Gorgeous dress with a gorgeous material and pattern. Unfortunately at 5'6 it makes me look box-ish. If you are shorter with of a course a shorter torso I'm sure this would look great on you though.
3.0,I should have listened to other reviews bcuz it tore after one use and one wash! The tutu stitching came apart and now I’ll either have to fix it or buy another!
3.0,"these shoes are adorable BUT  the elastic across the top of the foot was too tight and we had to buy a larger size shoe to compensate...so she had more than enough room in the foot area....they were very pretty, and otherwise great.  Luckily they shipped quickly!"
3.0,"Too small for an average adult head,  but still funny!"
3.0,"Due to Covid-19, I was laid off from my bartending job and opted to find other work rather than apply for unemployment. So now I work stocking freezers with boxes of meat. Glamorous, I know. It’s freezing cold and I have to constantly cut open packaging that holds the boxes together, so instead of using the communal freezer gloves I decided to buy these because I also have a tendency to scrape or cut my hands. They work, definitely. They protect from cuts and are pretty warm which is a plus, but I purchased the size small and they’re still to big. I can’t really use them because the extra fabric flopping at my finger tips makes it hard to get a decent grip on the boxes. I can probably give them to my boyfriend so I won’t return them but I wish they came in a smaller size."
3.0,"Product is good just very mad it came in way later than expected to come in, too many delays in shipping 😤. I like when my packages are on time not late."
3.0,"5 year old daughter who weighs 39lbs, ordered a 5-6 and they just barely fit, order size up"
3.0,I really liked this one until it broke..... If you're going to buy it just don't wear it too often and it is best with a dress or really low rise pant so nothing snags it.
3.0,"This shirt is OK for the money. However, it could be better. The fabric is not very high quality, and my biggest problem with the shirt is the tiny, flimsy, strangely-shaped collar. It's not very obvious from the photos but the collar is sort of strangely shaped and small.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a big deal, and this is an outrageous design, so I don't regret buying it."
3.0,"runs large, material cheap.  looks richer in the picture, but what do you expect for the price :)"
3.0,"It is a very nice necklace, I like that the stones are not real big but the chain broke the first time putting it on."
3.0,"Really stylish dress. The Mayerial is very low end. But …. For the price, I should’ve expected that. I will wear the dress but would’ve loved a more elegant material."
3.0,"I never have issues with a bracelet being too small because I have 6 inch wrists. Usually my problem is the other way around where my bracelets will slip right off my hand. This bracelet was made for a child, and I don’t think there’s an adult out there that can wear this. Also it felt pretty cheaply made and the flowers felt like you could bend them easily. So as cute as it is, I cannot recommend this even if you have four inch wrists….."
3.0,"Fits perfect and the dress is flattering. Because of the material, the dress is not as casual as I expected."
3.0,"I had purchased this set before, so I wanted to buy a second one and give it to my friend. However this secod set was lighter weight and smaller  so I coulthan the first one. I just didn't bother sending it back. I wish they are more consistent with their quality and I would buy more..."
3.0,I really like the design of this band but it is very itchy. Not the most comfortable band I have. I only used it for a short amount of time before getting a new band.
3.0,It fits great and looks just like the Triangl bikinis! The only complaint I have is there is no padding in the top so it's a little loose.
3.0,Color and style are pretty. Fabric is scratchy
3.0,Stiff fabric. I ordered another color previously and loved the comfy fabric but the red roses was a different fabric. Love the pockets though
3.0,A little bummed you show a stand in every picture but it doesn't come with 1
3.0,"Nothing great, not bad either just meh"
3.0,"Main issue is I have is it tangles all the time, I can't wear it more than a few hours without it tangling. I've actually worn multiple necklaces that aren't connected that tangles. Also the evil eye does not lay flatly and flips around quite a bit. It is still very attractive, and good for the price. But, I might end up recycling into something else."
3.0,The quality of the dress is not that great. The fit is as expected.
3.0,It has silvery sparkles in it (almost like tinsel).  It does shed a lot.  I took it directly outside and shook it for a bit and it is still shedding.  It had a few red feathers stuck in it which I thought was odd.  I easily pulled them out.  It will do for a Halloween costume.
3.0,"So cute,but small and short."
3.0,"I bought this dress in ivory. The fabric is fairly thing and rather see-through. It is super clingy and shows every lump and bump and edges of my bra, etc. I would not recommend it unless you plan on wearing a full slip underneath. Depending on your body shape, it could look cute as-is, but it might be more flattering with a wide belt or sash. It's definitely a trapeze cut and does not have a waistline. The skirt does have nice flare and bounce for dancing.<br /><br />It did serve the purpose that I bought it for, I needed a white dress as a dance costume to wear for just a couple performances. Though I was hoping it could also double as something I could wear elsewhere, but I don't think I will be, as it's kind of cheap looking.<br /><br />I suspect this dress might be a little nicer in some of the darker colors as they won't be so see-through. I may dye mine a different color, as I only needed the white for a one-time use."
3.0,"Good product but if you don't want to feel like a stuffed sausage, get a few sizes up"
3.0,"I've bought shirts like this in other brands and I ordered my normal size, and usually they are a bit big, this one was a bit small. I have a short torso and it still is too short. So size up, otherwise it is a nice material and the red is a nice color."
3.0,You get what you pay for. Fits as expected but the material is horrible. Not sure I’ve ever felt anything like it.
3.0,"OK. Bought xxl pretty much true to size. Belt was very small though, did not fit."
3.0,It doesn't fit my husband...how can I exchange it for a larger one?
3.0,I had to return these boots because the first ones I ordered were way to big even though it says there is a difference. I had to order a size 2 sizes smaller then it said the US size was to get the correct size.
3.0,For the price it is a good buy. I did not love the unsteady feeling of the cameras and would have suggested maybe a more secure vest piece or waist piece. They just swing a bit too much for my taste.
3.0,The fit on this is kinda strange. The top mostly fits good but the criss cross in the front hangs loose with extra fabric. The bottoms are the same the main piece of the bottoms fits nice but the extra piece with the cut outs at the top is tighter than the actual bottoms.
3.0,"Looks cheap for price paid. The picture on Amazon makes it look like the colors for this pendant are &#34;in&#34; the glass, like true blown glass.  Nope. When I got it, the colors are flat and the back of the pendant is all black, causing me to suspect the colors are really just a colored sticker behind some clear glass giving the necklace a very flat appearance. Bag is as descriped, as is necklace. Still pretty, just just not worth the price. Will keep, but will NOT be buying any other pieces, now that I know just the colors are just stickers."
3.0,"This is nice but it is super clingy. So if you have any lumps and rolls, this thing will show it all.  I normally wear size L and sometimes XL. I bought  XXL and it fits close to the body.<br />* I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
3.0,Way too small. Offered the same size I frequently buy from other sellers but was much smaller than all than all of them. It was supposed to be a gift but it’s still sitting on my dresser in the box.
3.0,"Oh women's sizing, how I hate thee! You just never know what size to order, sigh. But, I shall share my knowledge with you so that you can succeed in your ordering endeavor.<br /> I carry all my weight in midsection (apple shape) which can make buying bottoms even more challenging. If something fits over my belly then I need a bigger size than if I can wear them under my belly. I prefer to wear things under my belly so I went with a size S (usually wear a 6/8/28 for under belly). The elastic waist helps, but they're a little tight. This also means they aren't quite as loose around the legs as they're meant to be. I think a medium would have been better. I like the fabric. They're light and breathe well. I haven't had any major concerns with wear and fading. The ruffles aren't quite as big and full as they're pictured. One side of the bottom of my shorts is higher than the other, but it's not that way on both legs so there may be a bit of a quality control issue. Lengthwise I like where they hit (other than the side that's shorter than the rest). They are not too short and not too long and I say that as a mom of 5 who's bending down all the time and likes to be modest, but doesn't necessarily want to wear Bermuda shorts."
3.0,"While the item ran very small, it is very beautiful. I opted to gift it instead of returning it"
3.0,Color not what expected.
3.0,"I had ankle surgery so I needed lose fitting socks similar to what I was given in the hospital. I wear a size 7 and thought ordering the xl would be a bit lose for comfort just as I wanted.  The socks arrived quickly which was a plus.  Sadly they are way too tight and constricting. The material doesn’t feel like soft terry cloth, it almost looks like it’s some type of knit.  I also noticed the design of the sock in the Amazon site is not the same as the socks I received which was another disappointment.  I would not buy thee again."
3.0,"First off, I do like the color. The font is not the one pictured, buts it’s doable. The thing that bothers me the most is the arm length. I am 5’9.5” and about 140. In the description it does not that they are Asian sizes, so I ordered a size larger. It is very loose and baggy, but the arms are literally 6 inches above my wrist which is a problem because like the shirt reads “Yes, I’m cold. ME 24:7”. I NEED longer sleeves!!!"
3.0,"The neckline is awesome. It is very flattering. The fabric is of quality. But that's as far as I can go with the pros. It's very strangely designed around this bottom. It looks like it would be very cute and unique in the picture but instead, once on, it's awkward and bunchy [for lack of a better word]. The sleeves are also too short for me. I can imagine this would be cute on someone very slim and petite, to which I'm neither. If it helps, I'm 5'10 and 175lbs and all hips so this may be the reason it doesn't look quite right on me."
3.0,The structure of the dress is not quite slimming. It makes your hips wider by pockets and smaller line on the lower part. If you take that into account and you like it anyway the fabric is good and ok.
3.0,"Nice clutch.  However, it needs to be a bit wider at the opening and bottom ... Cwould not fit my HTC one m9 in it.  Was unable to close clutch for that reason. Otherwise, a nice clutch."
3.0,Comfortable. Wished they were longer but like them.
3.0,"I actually love this dress, the fit of it and way it hind some problem areas with the cut is amazing and for the price you can’t beat it. I’m giving a 3 rating only because how low cut the dress is"
3.0,"I first ordered a small and it was super tiny... I could not even put it on. Returned it and ordered a medium. Medium is still a bit tight but I can squeeze into it. It looks cute,  but it’s not that comfortable. There’s not really enough elastic in the fabric. Should be stretchy if it’s going to be tight.<br /> I am 5‘3“ and weigh 105 pounds.  I almost always fit into an extra small normally."
3.0,I ordered this dress for my sister wedding. I usually wear a L/XL but I ordered and XXL because of the reviews I’ve read about it being smaller but with a little waist snatcher it will be fine. But I’m really giving it a 3 star because when I opened the package it had stains already on the dress I didn’t feel like returning it so I put stain remover on it and washed it and all the stains were gone.
3.0,The hooks do not stay in place and the lace keeps popping out.  I ended up using the laces differently than the instructions and it works.
3.0,"I wish i would have coated this with clear coat before wearing it, seemed to tarnish quickly in a humid environment."
3.0,"The first pair I put on tore, second pair one fell off and got lost... overall a bit uncomfy for behind the ears"
3.0,"These leggings lose their elasticity and don't fit as tightly from the first couple of times I wore them. Really comfortable leggings, but I wish these actually fit similar to the first wear."
3.0,Material is way to thin.
3.0,"Love the style, small for my taste. Good quality."
3.0,The yoga pants fit as expected.  They are comfortable and stretch with movement.
3.0,I would've gave it 4 stars if the option to have a large top and medium bottom was available. I'm 34DDD but I got a medium it fits alright but coming out a little from the top
3.0,"I wish I could write a better review, but, overall, I was disappointed with this package.<br /><br />The gaiters were well made and I received what I expected.<br /><br />However, after one wash, the gaiters wouldn't stay above my nose unless I remained silent and didn't move my mouth.<br /><br />Also, I had a hard time keeping the filter placed in my gaiter above my nose at all, reducing the effectiveness I hoped it would provide.<br /><br />I hoped I would like these more, but, in the end, I will probably just stick them in a draw and double up my existing polyester neck gaiters when I go out to the store."
3.0,The strap is nice and so is the watch but unless you’re a 12yr old boy or a woman or willing to put a new strap on it buy something else. The watch strap is very small and the watch itself is smaller making it look very feminine.
3.0,"I am 5'5"" 120 pounds and a small B cup. I liked the dress but found lots of lose stitching and there was quite the gap around my armpits (so it would probably work for ladies with larger B/C). The dress meets the floor and I hope it shrinks a little in the wash. True to color and style."
3.0,"They look great.  However, they are assembled poorly and the wood broke from the metal very easily because a cheap glue had been used to attach the two pieces.  I chipped off the crap glue and put some decent glue on and now theyre great."
3.0,pretty tight in the shoulders but besides that is comfortable
3.0,"This cover up is pretty, but has a really weird fit, the top of it is high and tight but the straps are too long and flap around,. Its chest and neck are also very narrow.  Again, pretty color, but fit me odd.<br />I'm 5""10 , 150 lbs and have a smaller chest."
3.0,Fits great but sometimes my heels pops out
3.0,"Very well made, but too expensive.  Ordered a medium (I'm 5'8&#34; , #170, 40 chest) and it extends over my rear end.  Otherwise it fits me perfectly.  It is very comfortable, and I am going to keep it.  It is not navy blue as the picture shows, but a blue/ gray heather.  Still very nice looking....  for $60.00+  I would not buy it again."
3.0,Very cute but wasn’t going to fit my 9year old
3.0,Not a lot of room
3.0,"Fit my legs and butt great! Was really loose on my waist, but I also have a extremely small waist"
3.0,was too large for a small
3.0,Lunch bag
3.0,"Runs large. I order a small and I'm  8 months pregnant, I wore Xsmall pre pregnancy,  and they are rather baggy. They don't fit like the picture shown. Cute enough though and comfy."
3.0,"The picture was misleading - I thought I would be getting a set of different sizes of the earrings instead of only one pair.  If I had known it would be one pair, I would have chosen a smaller size.  The earrings are pretty, though, and shipping was fast."
3.0,Fits smaller than it should. Should have ordered a size larger.
3.0,I couldn’t wear it
3.0,"The fade at the bottom can barely bee seen.  It doesn’t look like a design, it looks more like a flaw.  I’m keeping it only because it was so inexpensive."
3.0,"These fit perfectly and are quite comfortable. My problem with these is the gusset. Unfortunately, it sits too far back to be of any use at all. The front of the gusset hits me right where I'd expect the center to be, which means most of my discharge ends up on the underwear itself and I have a nice clean strip near the back where I don't need it. In order for it to be centered correctly I'd have to wear these high in the front and have the back only covering my butt halfway."
3.0,Bought as a gift. He likes them.
3.0,Too Big like them somewhat small
3.0,"I wanted to love it, but I can’t get the wrinkles out of it.  I have washed it 3 times ironed it while dry, ironed it while damp, allowed it to lay flat to dry, allowed it to hang dry, and they just won’t come out.  I originally thought they must be from the tie dying process, but the inside if the shirt is not dyed.  I can only assume it is a printed fabric and that these wrinkles came from the way the shirt was packaged.  The fabric is different than most shirts as well.  It is smooth on the outside but the inside of the shirt has a rougher knit feel to it.  It’s a comfortable lounge around the house shirt but I wouldn’t have ordered it for that purpose.  I really wanted to love it.  The colors are very pretty and I like the cut/fit of the shirt.  I just won’t leave my house in it since it looks like I just had it balled up in a hamper for weeks on end.  I have tried everything I know to get the shirt pressed except having it professionally dry cleaned, which is recommended on the tag, but I’m not sure I want the expense for what was just supposed to me a casual comfortable shirt.  I hope this is helpful and perhaps you might have better laundry skills than me.  If you buy this and find the secret to the wrinkles, let me know."
3.0,"Very pretty shoes. Fit as expected. Material does look durable. However, I did not like the metal ring that the top strap goes through. I definitely see that not lasting. And it was difficult for my almost 3yr old to pull it all the way, in order to tie it down."
3.0,"The hats are very thick and appear durable. The inner is lined with a faux fur. It is really high-end looking but unfortunately the hats are very ""long""...definitely way to big and tall for a toddler's head...I don't even know if an older child would be able to use it without it covering their eyes. Returning this one unfortunately."
3.0,"Just as described. Good value for the price I guess though the chain started to lose its gold coloring, rubbing to a bronzey color around where it touched my neck after only wearing it one night...Also does not hang at the clavicle, but square on my chest on the shortest of the fastening options."
3.0,I received the item and it was broke so now I have to try and repair it but besides that I really like the look of the necklace.
3.0,Ill give a 3 because it was very big for my wrist! But very pretty thoe just like the picture shows!
3.0,"Youth large is huge! Compared to other youth larges I have purchased it is much bigger, especially in the length. I would suggest buying a size smaller for sure. Quality appears good."
3.0,The mask was much bigger than I expected.
3.0,We bought this as a gift but when we received it I held it up and it seems to be on the smaller side but it didn't really have inclusive sizes because it stopped at 2x. We were hoping to order it to be big and comfy but it doesntbhave all inclusive sizes for bigger people.
3.0,"This seems like a great product, but a week of using (not daily and nothing heavy) and its tearing. Wanted to share the 6 pk with family members but rethinking..maybe the other ones will last?"
3.0,Confortable feel but quality is just ok. However it does the job of keeping feet warm in 20 Degree..
3.0,The fabrick is nice but the top part is weird. You clip it together. My plan is to take that out and just sew it.
3.0,I normally wear a large and could have went down to a medium in this
3.0,"It was very thin material, almost see thru"
3.0,I used this daily for 2 months and then the top pocket stitching ripped out. That stitching held two pockets together so two pockets are now not usable. Also the weather proofing stuff cracked and peeled away.
3.0,"The quality is not that great.  The stitching is showing and is not a good look.<br />The picture on it is nice,  but the stitching shows; not as it is shown."
3.0,"Nice well made shirt.  Looks exatly as pictured.  Ordered in 24 month size .  My son is 18 months old and it's a bit tight on him.  Well smaller than size advertised.  If possible order size larger if you want to get more then 2 months use out of it.  Please with the quality , not happy with the fit"
3.0,"It's really cute, the color I love it, but it is big from the breast and waist part of the swim suit, so I gave it away...."
3.0,Looks good. Quality seems to be good. Sizing want right. It was at least 1.5-2 sizes smaller than my other hoodies with the same size designation. Really tight around my neck.
3.0,"The material is nice not cheap or flimsy at all. I had to send it back though. It has a high waist which sat right under my chest-  the way it fell, it was not flattering on me at all. I am heavy and It made me look very round."
3.0,"The pants are soft and comfy,  but alot baggier than the pictures shows. I ordered medium and it felt like a large."
3.0,"These are pretty, but honestly I wonder if they are actually wool.  They kind of seem like cotton to me.  I washed, then dried in the dryer with no shrinkage.  And there is no content label in the packaging or on the socks.  Also, they are a bit too thick for most of my shoes.  Oh well."
3.0,The fabric felt weird an the stitching was all wonky. The print was not good quality. It got sent back.
3.0,"This is a very pretty ring, but I have found that I don't wear it because of how obviously fake it looks to me. if that is not a concern for you, then I would recommend it. If you're looking for something to replace a genuine ring, I would keep looking."
3.0,"Umpire waist, not natural waist. Makes all the pleating and bulk land in a bad place that doesn’t flatter my figure. Soft, nice material and color is true to the image. Will keep for a pool cover up/to wear around the house."
3.0,"Sleeves are 3/4 length, not long sleeve as described. Also, the color is definitely cream, not ""bright white"" like the description said. Otherwise it's cute and the size is as expected, but I'm returning it because I wanted a long sleeve white cardigan, not a 3/4 sleeve cream one."
3.0,Somewhat small.  Tight in arms so can't wear it with everything.
3.0,Cute patter and idea but not true to size.
3.0,The breast area is very loose and large and the tank is not long. It is wearable but def doesnt resemble the pic. Awkwardly not form fitting
3.0,"I ordered a medium which is what arrived but based on the fit of this nightgown I need at least a large if not an extra large. It is way too small to be comfortable. I plan on exchanging for a bigger size since I do like the style, but definitely size up."
3.0,"I love the color and feel and pockets, but rainwater appears to have stained the outside... Afraid to wash it to find out if that would clean the canvas"
3.0,"I ordered the pink. Because the product listing calls these “neon” retro sunglasses, I thought they’d be a brighter pink. They are a baby pink - very similar to Barbie pink. Not what I was expecting. Otherwise, they seem fine for the price."
3.0,Not as cute as they look in photo weird shape
3.0,I'm a 36DD and this is not a high impact bra. I do think it's cute as a normal bra - it basically looks like a push up bra on me. The shoulder straps don't stay in place well.
3.0,"The padding isn’t that thick. Also, they are very difficult to remove, even with the tabs. Also, they stretch a lot durning the ride which causes the fingers of the gloves to pull down into the are between my fingers. They’re not awful but I’ve had better."
3.0,I bought this several sizes too large and it is marked appropriately just looks and fits at least 2 sizes too small.  Material is very thin and silky feeling but the sizing will throw off the experience.  I wear lg-x-lg depending on maker and materials and this matches a junior medium not a women’s size.
3.0,I ordered the four pack and only got two tanks. They fit great and look nice. I would give a five star ranking but I only got two in the pack when I was supposed to get four.
3.0,It was less flattering than the picture. I felt like it billowed around me. I returned it because it's not my style.
3.0,"Good quality! But no pockets. Pictures are misleading. I repeat- IT DOES NOT HAVE POCKETS. Also, I am a medium and almost 6 ft. It is long enough for me, but the sleeves are not to my wrist. More like a quarter length sleeve."
3.0,"Just to set a few things straight with self claimed large head description, 160mm is not by any means a large head frame, it's more like very small step up from medium. 160mm is roughly 6 inches wide. I just really hate when companies use titles like this when it isn't true.<br /><br />I am 6'7, the length someone like me would need is around 200mm, ~8 inches wide. I didn't buy these as I try to get details on things before hand and luckily I did. I'm not saying anything bad about the glasses as I don't have them, but this is simply a review in regards to those who don't look into actual sizes or know what they need ahead of time, maybe they will read this and check to be sure. This is why I gave it a 3/5, for neutral purposes."
3.0,I read the reviews before ordering. I wanted something petite and dainty. But this is by far  extremely small and fragile. Hoping it holds up for the price I paid.
3.0,What a beautiful piece . It look rich and the color is very nice. I wore it to dinner and the waiter as me about it.
3.0,"I wasn't thrilled with this shirt. It didn't look like I thought it would, and the material was a bit cheap feeling. I thought it would have more of the &#34;cold shoulder&#34; look, but it doesn't. You can barely see the detail of the straps."
3.0,runs small as plus size shirt
3.0,Good product. Only issue is it came with a hole in the sleeve seam
3.0,Cute. I usually wear a small I should have ordered a medium to get the same look as the picture.
3.0,"the closing could be better, a toggle clasp is hard to work, and the button arrived chipped."
3.0,"The item description says it’s a sweatshirt but it’s really just a long-sleeved tee shirt.  The image also shows a light pink but the product itself is darker.  I’m a bit disappointed, I should have paid closer attention to the reviews before buying"
3.0,Cheap  feeling and stink
3.0,What I didn't like about the bag is that is not a little deeper...that could be my mistake for not recognizing the dimensions. However for the price of the bag it's ok...does the job it was intended to do...allow clear bags into a concert/stadium venue.<br />Not sure if I would really recommend it though.
3.0,Wife liked this but I followed advice that it runs small and ordered next size up and she would have liked the the size suggested! So not sure on the runs small reviews posted but not the case here. Other wise it's a nice product and would recommend it.
3.0,"...and it is not cotton. I actually am the same height and weight as the model in that picture. It doesn't fit like that. The shoulder area is too wide, armpits as well and sleeves are oddly long."
3.0,too big was ordered they wish
3.0,"Hard to see in bright light, functional loses about 2 minutes a month."
3.0,Nice rings but the sizing is off. I wear a size 7 and measured my finger agin just to check and they were still too small. I am sending these back!
3.0,"PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT, ITS THE HONEST TRUTH ABOUT SIZING AND its the most recent commment ;;;)<br /><br />So I'm 5 feet 2 inches, about 35 inches around my waist (I think..) and I wanted sorta baggy overalls, not skinny. But when I read the reviews, people were saying to order 2 sizes up. I'm normally a small so since I wanted the baggy look, I ordered a large. It's TOO BIG. The pictures along with this comment was after I washed and dried them in HEAT and the sizing only went down about half an inch. If you want the baggy look, please order one size up MAX because I'm going to have to wash these until they fit. The waist is about 2 inches too big. And yes, I know I should've read the measurements before I ordered 🙄. The color is more blue than the picture. It's not stretchy, they just feel like jeans. The pants are way too long so I rolled them up 3 times. And they make me look so flat lol. Other than that they look cute 😊 I'm wearing these with converse 💪 Hope this helped."
3.0,"This dress is not bad for $13. The quality isn't as high and colors are not as vibrant as the picture shows, but it is comfortable. I can definitely dress this up or down!"
3.0,"The top part fit good, but the bottom have is very wrinkled and stiff."
3.0,"Product is much darker than the image would suggest. It looks silver in the pictures on amazon, but in reality, is a much darker color."
3.0,"I was expecting the horns to be bigger or the headband to be smaller, but either way I was a little disappointed by the product. Overall though, if you know what you're purchasing than it's perfect for any costume."
3.0,The right boot was more snug than the left one. First time ive had that issue before.
3.0,Although the g in “Chicago” on the back of the hat  looks like a q .. my husband still likes this hat.
3.0,Nice mask but it smells toxic. I’ve been trying to let it air out but I’m not sure if we can use it.
3.0,"The fabric quality of the pants is fine. The design and fit leaves room for improvements.  The crotch to waist area is way out of proportion for the pants. Its very large. On my 8 and 10 year old, the sit on their mid stomach."
3.0,"I really love this bracelet, and like one other review said, the bracelet does tarnish, just not the charms. That being said, you have to be extremely carful with the angel wings because this is pewter, mine snapped in half, luckily I think that still looks good, especially seeing Castiel's condition currently in the show, but it was still disappointing.<br /><br />*Edit: The charms have now started to tarnish too, which is disappointing, though I still love this bracelet. I would recommend coating the charms and the chain with clear nail polish before wearing it for the first time, and be careful with the wings."
3.0,"overall well made gloves, but the lining inside was falling apart so i never use them. they feel like theyd take most of the impact though"
3.0,Polyester!!!!<br />If you don’t like polyester do not buy!<br />The top is cute and very Transparent.
3.0,They didnt stay on very well
3.0,"Cute, but with some problem. One of the candies are broken. I’m also missing 3 gummy bears. And the wire loop on top unscrews easily from all the lollipops and a couple of the other ones. I’ll have to glue each one in before using. I don’t want to be giving these away as gifts and they fall apart. Won’t buy again."
3.0,"I still get some fogging on my glasses, and it feels bulky on my face. The headstrap sometimes slides down when I move my head around."
3.0,"Not a polished, shiny metal like it looks in the pic. It is def more like the stainless steel of a refrigerator or garbage can. Nonethless, it was good quality. So good of quality in fact I cannot bend it to tighten it on my ear and so I'm always worried it will fall off."
3.0,"I laundered and hung this tshirt to dry prior to reviewing.<br />It shrunk a little, but did not fade or lose its shape.<br />I typically wear a M but ordered a L due to some of the other reviews.<br /><br />This tshirt is cute, the fabric is nice and thick, so that you feel like it will last a while.<br />The stitching, hem, and stitching on the cute little pocket is good quality.<br />The color is very nice.<br /><br />However, this tshirt is cut way too small. It simply is not cut true to size. I hope the designers with revisit their pattern, because it's a shame for this cute tshirt to be too small to wear.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful."
3.0,"Size up when you order, it runs small"
3.0,A little too heavy for my ears
3.0,It’s way too big despite following guidelines for size. There’s no way to adjust anything but it quality material.
3.0,It's fine.  Wish the visor was bigger
3.0,It is much too big.  Will need to have it made smaller.
3.0,"Weird fabric, not flattering"
3.0,"The piece looks very nice and its sturdy, but its a bit uncomfortable on the ear, unlike many similar products Ive used. It cant really be adjusted so the tail doesnt quite fit over the earlobe, but its still very worth the price."
3.0,"These sandals were at least one-half size too big. I was able to adjust them for an OK fit, but if I were to order them again I would definitely order at least a half size smaller. There is no arch support, so the jury is out as far as foot strain...I will update this review after a couple of weeks of wear. If the fit was better and these had an arch support, I would have possibly given a higher rating."
3.0,"As an adult, these were too tight and uncomfortable to wear.  Would fit a child much better, I think."
3.0,The clip bends out of shape and doesn't always clamp money securely.  However it works great with cards.
3.0,"earrings are heavy and too big for me, gave them to my niece, she really like them"
3.0,un xl equivle a un L
3.0,They were too small for my glasses and the larger ones were too big. Also they have rubber things on the ear pieces that get tangled in my hair. Should have returned them.
3.0,"The material is thick and the overall fit is ok, but it is much shorter than described.  I am 5'9&#34; and wear a size 8.  the large came above my ankles in length."
3.0,Soft fabric and nice fit
3.0,These would have been nice shorts had they not come with a hole in the pocket. Husband found it after he put them on so cannot return or exchange them
3.0,"Beautiful purse, but liner frays too easily. The color and design of these bags are even prettier in person, and I have received many compliments about the bag looking super expensive.  The point of contention I have is that the liner has already begun to rip and fray...very disappointing. Would love a replacement!"
3.0,"Ordered a large, the bottoms fit, but it’s like the holes for my legs are too small and I’m an averaged size woman. The top is cute and comfy though."
3.0,When washing the product the the ear sizer broke so no longer does it fit my son. He wore only for a week and just looked the return window was yesterday.
3.0,"I have a slight obsession with bulldogs, so I was excited to purchase these earrings. Opened the box to find they were fairly large in size - we're not talking covering your earlobe large, but a solid inch or so in diameter. Keeping them for more of a fun vibe, but I wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a dainty earring choice."
3.0,Love material but too small. Should of ordered a bigger size.
3.0,Fits tight around the band but not for larger bust
3.0,The lens poped out when I cleaned them.
3.0,Not as thick as they look. They’re pretty small and thin. They also don’t fit the one size fits all moto.
3.0,I’m 5’1 and 107 lbs this dress was huge on me. I got the small. The fabric was a little weird for me as well. I’m returning!
3.0,Meh. Not so comfortable.
3.0,",zipper very stiff,expected to be better quality."
3.0,Functions on watch are just for show. However it does keep good time.
3.0,Slides down my little ones face a bit!
3.0,"I bought these pants to keep my son warm during cold recesses. Half of the reviews here say the pants are too big, the other half say they are too small. So I didn’t know what to believe and just ordered my son’s usual size. As you can see, they are WAY larger than other manufacturers’. On the left are a pair of sweatpants from Target in 4T and on the right are these pants in 4T. They are huge. Oh well, at least he can grow into them. But I guess I’ll have to reorder more pants for now."
3.0,Pretty but looks cheap.
3.0,Very long!  Will need to be hemmed.
3.0,"I like the fit of these glasses; snug on my face and don't fall off my nose, even though I don't have much of a bridge.  What I really don't like, that would keep me from recommending them or buying them again, is the reflective lenses.  They are incredibly difficult to keep clean, even after washing them in soap and water.  One of the lenses popped out twice while trying to clean them.  Just too much bother for the price."
3.0,"This was a great outfit. My daughter loves anything with pockets. It was a bit small, next time I'll  it in a bigger size."
3.0,Looks like the picture but doesn't look like a sparkly diamond ring.  Looks like speckled metal.  Not glittery at all unless in direct light
3.0,Not very flattering and the color was darker than I expected
3.0,It's a winter hat that I was expecting to be more for dress up.  I don't like items from third parties.
3.0,Dont like the material.  Top portion fits strange
3.0,"Unfortunately, were a little too small for my 10 year old."
3.0,"I bought this because of all of the card slots. However, when I filled it with cards in mostly all of the slots, it seemed bulgy and didn't want to close. I was really disappointed in this wallet due to the fact that you can't use all of the card slots if you want the wallet to close. Other than that, the wallet was as expected."
3.0,Jacket looks great on my 12 year old son. It is also light weight and good fashion statement to transition to Fall. It is just what my son wanted but it smells fishy. When we opened the package the odor was very strong. We aired it outside overnight but it still smells like fish.I'm giving this 3 stars due to odor.
3.0,Is very pretty now getting on and attached the back part was a hassle I ended up loosing the end of the earring I have to find now one that can fit so I can use.
3.0,"The fit was too big, and the waist unflatteringly high. It’s also kind of transparent (can’t wear dark underwear) but not too bad. I’m returning it; it’s just not for my body type. Flows over the smallest part of the waist and is tighter on hips"
3.0,Love the color and fabric but too tight in the waist
3.0,"I have a lot of tanks this style in different brands, but I didn't care for this one as much. For the price I should have gone with the other brands however I needed this in orange & this brand was the only one I could find it in. The layer of fabric under the top layer is really short while the top layer is very long. It makes you look boxy."
3.0,It's wearable but nothing like the picture. It is shorter and not off shoulder. To be fair I am a big and tall but even so it wouldn't be long and off shoulder on a petite person.
3.0,"The shoes are well made and sturdy, and the light-up feature blows away any other shoes that just turn on when you stomp your feet! BUT, they needed to be charged daily. My 4 year old son wore them a handful of times, and by the 5th time, only one shoe worked. I thought it was the battery but I charged them both and only one held the charge. Now he doesn’t want them anymore since only one works. ☹️ I wouldn’t get these again."
3.0,"I like these socks a lot, they are very soft and the designs are super cute. But they shed a lot - before you wash, after you wash, it didn’t make a difference. They produce a lot of lint."
3.0,"I love the color, length and the weight of the fabric, but it just does't fit right on me. I bought a large because XL in this brand fits a bit big on me, but the buttons at the top of the skirt gap a little bit and it really accentuates the extra tissue I carry in my midsection."
3.0,"It's okay, but won't last through one kid."
3.0,Slightly large for me but most XS dresses are in the waist. I would have kept it the gingham pattern hadn't been so badly off center. May not bother others but visual mismatches like that drive me nuts. Not the highest quality but okay.
3.0,... but I am pretty sure I will lose my watch at some point. The band opened up several times when taking clothes off or putting them on. I can imagine it coming off just by rubbing it inadvertently on something.
3.0,"The arm sleeves are not sized proportionately to the dress. The body of the dress was perfect, the sleeves are too small with no stretch."
3.0,These socks still don't stay on all day. They are better than most though.
3.0,hard to find bikini string panties in  nylon...  ok for the price
3.0,the pants were too  small for<br />me
3.0,loved the bag. Perfect size for a weekend. Classic looking. However long strap handle and zipper broke after one use....
3.0,Really pretty but way off in size!
3.0,Dress was cute but felt heavy. Smooth texture. Didn’t think it looked great on my hour-glass figure (typically wear size 10-12). Just looked as though it “hung” on my body. Returned. Wish this would’ve worked. Had plans to pair it with leopard print leggings. It may work for someone else.
3.0,"I wanted to get this since it was cheap enough and the anime hardly has any merch yet. The keychain came as described, but I’m disappointed in the quality. The keychain came in a small plastic bag that did nothing for the protection of it, not to mention it came with little finger prints all over it :( I tried my best to show some of the scratches and bumps in the design in my review photos. I didn’t use it yet and it already looks worn. I feel like the photo on it isn’t being protected either, so it would only last a few months or so. Slightly disappointed with this :("
3.0,"Just ok...First off this is a cheap fabric, and the print is not crisp and well done.  Secondly, the cut is a bit off for me.  I found this very small for the claimed size 12, I am a size 8, medium and this fit me perfectly.  I didn't find this blouse flattering at all, but my husband thought it was fine for work, so I guess thats ok.  It is easy care, and washed and dried easily.  There is no need for an iron, as the fabric is easy care.  I am 5'4"" and 130# and this is a size 12...I do like the pattern, but it is not quite right in the front.  It doesn't lay right in the bust, a bit high.  The top is a pull on top and the design is the same fabric print on the back.  This is a modest look, although I prefer a neckline that is about an inch higher for work.  The arm holes are comfortable and do not bind, and are not too large.  If you normally wear a size 12 and have larger arms, this would be extremely tight on you, so size up if you decide to buy."
3.0,"The actual pieces are pretty nice quality. They're not as bright as the pictures. They're not labelled so you have to sort them out by eye. Not a big deal at all. The rubber o-rings are mismatched. Some of them don't fit. For instance, for the 4 gauge plugs, the two accompanying o-rings that are placed inside the bag are clearly not the same. I had to find matching o-rings from the tapers. Annoying but not a big deal. The problem is that they gave me three 0 gauge plugs and one 2 gauge plug. Also, I'm pretty sure the 14 and 12 gauge plugs are exactly the same but that isn't a huge issue at those sizes. I'm mostly concerned about the missing 2 gauge plug. This set would have received a 5 star rating if they had the set organized better."
3.0,Product runs extra small. Need two sizes up and does not allow returns or exchanges.
3.0,"I ordered this dress in two sizes...16-18 (pink) and 18-20 (floral black) as I normally wear an 18 but have lost weight.  Both dresses that I received are marked XXXXL.  When I tried them on,  the one that should have been a 16-18  fits and the 18-20 is much tighter than the 16-18.  The fabric is a light polyester, as expected.  The buttons will definitely have to be re-sewn or replaced with better buttons as they were popping open and very loose.  I love the fabric patterns but will only be able to wear one of the dresses until I lose a few more pounds.  I'm 5'8 with a 34"" inseam and both dresses are just below knee length on me. I really wish theses sellers would get their act together and start selling American sizes to American buyers and be more consistent with their sizing.  It's the same dress...how are you off this much?"
3.0,The material is very thin and the dress fits very tightly. You have to have flawless figure for this dress. I love the design and sleeves are amazing but it is not a dress for me.
3.0,clear under water no water gets in good for price
3.0,"Should say ""child's hat"" in the description. I am pretty small, (my head is 22 inches) and when I put it on it was way too tight. I gave it to my neighbor's 8 year old son. It fits him perfectly! Adorable design."
3.0,"I went by the size chart and wish I hadn't.  The shirt is a little bigger than I expected.  My husband likes this top on me, even though I'm not sure I like it.  The material is thick, but is made to last a long time and through many washes."
3.0,"I like wearing skirts while running and trail running. I have mixed feelings about this skirt for running. What I like about it are the colors and design. It has a drawstring at the waist which is crucial for keeping it from falling while running. The skirt isn't tight enough at the waist without it. The length of the outer skirt is great. I love the leg pockets as they are big enough to keep my phone and pepper spray while running. There are also 2 pockets on the outer skirt on the front/sides.<br /><br />There are a few things I wish were better about this skirt. The spandex material on the legs is thin and not high quality. Plus they don't fit tight enough to keep from riding up between my legs which causes the dreaded ""chub rub"". I ordered the medium which fits good for casual wear but I would like the legs tighter for running and hiking. Also, this skirt doesn't look great on me. Not the skirts fault. It's just not flattering on me, mostly because of where the pockets fit. Overall, this skirt is okay though I've had better skirts for outdoor activities. Most likely, I'll end up using this for lighter activity or gym workouts."
3.0,Color was a little off and it was a little tight. BUT I will say it's quality material...good purchase. Order a size up for a looser fit.
3.0,"They were a bit on the small side and the gem screws into the bar, not onto it, unlike others, so it can't be easily interchanged with other jewelry."
3.0,"First off I love Casio watches, especially the f-91w. I've bought multiple. I always put a new Barton band on it. However the last one I purchased, it was IMPOSSIBLE to replace the band. Not sure if the pin system is different but I ended up destroying the side of the watch and cutting myself in the process. Never had this issue before. The finish on the new one seems to be a matte finish, different from my old one. Will try and return but again.. this thing is destroyed after an hour of trying to swap the band. Got one side 50% attached and the other side I could not.<br />*** Update. 2 days of tinkering with it and I finally attached the new band. Wouldn't let it beat me. Last pic shows my old on the left and (this) new one on the right. See the difference in finish?"
3.0,"Both the top and the bottom fit like a dream.<br />However, the top has a weird chemical scent to it that I cannot remove even after washing a few times.<br />Nothing else I own has this smell and while not extremely unpleasant, it is definitely noticeable while worn.<br />I will only be wearing the bottom as a result. Would be a 5 star purchase if not for this smell."
3.0,A bit stiff and uncomfortable
3.0,The top fit perfectly and keeps me very warm. Sadly I couldn’t get the pants past my knees. It’s a bummer because I really like the top! Went hiking in 20 degree weather and my arms and torso were warm!
3.0,"ok  Had trouble getting the back to stay on<br />made well, just keeps coming off"
3.0,Fit great but clarity not fine........... revival of old polarized oakley.
3.0,"hingles loose, didn't fit right"
3.0,While the Momcozy seamless ultracomfort support bra is well made it is way too small. I will say the material is soft and comfortable but too small around and not long enough either. When ordering definitely size up.
3.0,"Look pretty, but most of the flowers were broken on arrival."
3.0,"It is much larger than I thought it would be. This is for someone who wanted a large cross, so if that is what you are looking for, this is your choice."
3.0,The quality is nice. Looks also good.<br /><br />But it is too short.<br />I’m 5.7 / 140pounds<br />Ordered medium.<br /><br />Maybe I had to order XL - and it will fit more interesting.
3.0,Pretty thin but very chic and cute I wore it to a comic Con has storm.
3.0,Good dress for the price. Runs big and it looks like it’s perfect for big bust ladies. Gives you a nice shape
3.0,"So, I was expecting a loose-fitting boyfriend ""style"" tunic that was still more or less cut to feminine proportions and would be long enough to cover my bottoms. What I got was a man's extra-long shirt with pockets. I don't hate it, it's just not what I was expecting in terms of fit and cut. Annoyingly (which is always the case with men's wear, but again...boyfriend style doesn't mean ""cut for a man""), when the shirt is fully buttoned is sits  completely loose (almost tent-like) around my waist but clings to my hips and thighs in a very unflattering way.<br /><br />With that said, the material is very comfortable and warm, and it seems to be relatively well-made, so I am keeping it. The search is still on for the perfect loose-fitting, long and flattering flannel button up for the fall. C'est la vie."
3.0,"Great quality, it does run small...just size up!"
3.0,"Very thin material, cheap feeling to touch."
3.0,These shorts were good but did not last long. The reflective parts peeled off first then the stitching in one of the pockets deteriorated leaving me with basically one functioning pocket within 12-18 months.
3.0,"Cute t-shirt, but insanely small sizes. Anorexically tiny. Don't order this unless you are super skinny."
3.0,Fit is ok. Ordered blue. Received purple. one shoe does not light up. We have a disappointed 3 year old.
3.0,I would have given this five stars except for the fact that the designers added wads of fabric into the hips that completely ruin the lines and serve no purpose. Great for lounging around. I'm married to a Moroccan and it reminds us of how women dress at home. ❤️ Except for those darn pockets.
3.0,"I ordered this being under the impression that it was a tunic (see picture with ad)...it's more like a regular, old flannel shirt...only not quality flannel.  It's thin, short, and not very cute at all.... highly disappointed.  I rated it higher than it actually deserves."
3.0,Nice ring. A little big but very pretty
3.0,Ok shoe. However the cute rhinestones do not stay on for very long. A little disappointed.
3.0,"I bought this when I was pregnant when my fingers started to swell, and it lasted the 4 months I needed it to before the main CZ fell out of the top.  One of the side stones fell out almost immediately, and it did tarnish within the grooves where the side stones are.  The rose gold plating also  rubbed off quickly.  If you need something for short term use, this will work."
3.0,The top part is see through and the make doesn’t seem all that sturdy.
3.0,"Super comfortable and a good length, but it was very wide around the waist. I'm 5'5&#34; and 110lbs, ordered the small. If there were a smaller size, I'd exchange it, but as is, it's comfortable enough that it's worth keeping."
3.0,"These sunglasses are absolutely adorable. They look great on and they fit really well, however, I find that if I wear them while driving I’m almost more blinded by the sun. Especially if the sun is shining in from the sides. All in all they’re cute but definitely just for fashion."
3.0,"The shirt is great, but it had holes all over it. There were no holes in the plastic bag it was in either. I'm sending it back, and had to order another one. Hopefully, I'm not sent the same one again. I also lost the $6 I had to pay for shipping and had to pay it again."
3.0,The height of the socks was perfect.
3.0,I expected all four caps to be satin lined. Only two of the four caps were satin lined! I’m not pleased!!
3.0,A bit cheap material but works for weekly swimming lessons (if you swim more often than that with ur kid maybe invest in better quality that will last longer)
3.0,"I purchased this delicate stainless steel heart bracelet on October 3, 2019.  It still hasn't come in.  It's probably a third party vendor.  The bracelet looks beautiful, but I won't know until I receive the order.  UPDATE:  I finally received the stainless steel heart bracelet, and it is very small, more for a child than an adult.  I returned it."
3.0,"Everything about the back was good. However, the zipper that closes the whole bag wasn't working. I had to return and replace it. Hopefully, the next one works."
3.0,The fabric was swooshy and reminded me of athletic material. The neck was always bending. Its perfect for sleeping or lounging only.
3.0,"I was hoping for more yellow as shown in the picture and because it seems to be this year's color. It's not of a cream color. Simple design, will pair it with something gray."
3.0,Received different color combination than what was shown. Loose strings and bad stitching on all shirts
3.0,"I bought size Large wanting an oversized look, but I think the sizes are Asian sizing. The Large fit like a men’s/unisex medium. The print was vibrant and was on both sides of the shirt which was great, and delivery was fast too! The fabric isn’t very breathable even though it looks like Jersey, it gets a bit sweaty. Still though, loved wearing this shirt to the F9 premiere!"
3.0,"Band fits fine but upon wearing it the band keeps popping out of place on the device. I noticed that it is missing a screw on one side, also the band is turning blue. It does not rub off on your skin though. If it had both I'd give it a few more stars."
3.0,"Watch band is as advertised.  It seems to be well made and has held up well after two months' daily wear.  It is, however, too short for an adult male.  The double D-rings should serve as a redundant clasp after the long end is buckled; with this band, though, the tail end is too short to be brought back through the D-rings.<br /><br />Bottom line, it is exactly as described, it works, but is not any different than a standard watch band with only one buckle."
3.0,Super cute outfit however extremely see through!
3.0,I thought it would be shorter in length.
3.0,"Purchased this for my son, he loves it. I was not happy with the look of the fabric, its like a basketball jersey material. The material that snags and stains easily."
3.0,"It's cute. The fabric feels satin like and is kind of see through. It shorter than the pic though. I'm 5'4""and it came up to my ankles."
3.0,"I really like the style. They are pretty comfortable, but they aren't as well made for what they cost."
3.0,"Too tight to wear! Had to return for larger size. Ordered by bra size, should have ordered by blouse size. If you wear a 2x top, then order a 2x or xxl  sports bra."
3.0,"I bought these earrings a while ago, and I really like them.  I only wish they were bigger, as they are quite small and for my size (height mostly) it is hard to notice them."
3.0,It was bigger then I expected and pockets are tight but looks good and my son loves it.
3.0,It is a gift for my mother for Christmas.
3.0,Only uses them half the season and already have a worn hole in them.
3.0,"I bought the large due to the measurements on the page.<br />They were way too loose on my knees and had extra at the waist.<br />I am 5'6 and 152 lbs. I have Thick but not huge legs. And  hips plus a little bit of abdomen at bottom, no waist<br /> If you are like my size i would go to the MED"
3.0,Held up for a couple months.
3.0,Cute. Yarn/ string comes unraveled. This happened after the first wear. You get what you pay for I guess
3.0,"The design of this kimono is really cute. The fabric is light weight however, it feels like it isn't the best of quality--thin and looks like it will shrink unless hand washed in cold water. My daughter is tall so this summer cover up was a bit too short on her but it would likely fit great on average height women.  This would be perfect for a trip to the beach.  Overall, a really cute kimono but be prepared to give it a lot of TLC to keep it in good shape."
3.0,This is a cute dress! The fabric was light and cool and the patterns on the dress were colorful. Perfect for summer!
3.0,"Beautiful packaging, quick delivery, belt was good quality but too small.  Thought it fit up to 48' my finacee is a 40' and it didn't fit, kinda disappointed."
3.0,"The clip that attaches to your belt or wherever it is worn popped off about a week after purchase. I was able to reattach it but it's loose and I can only wear it on thick items such as belts or layered clothing. Expensive for the quality, probably would not purchase again."
3.0,The picture maximizes the sparkle of the product.  It was not nearly as pretty in person and my daughter was disappointed enough to send them back.  Cute idea without great execution.
3.0,"The fabric and print is pretty. I wanted to like this dress! The dress was cut very small. It was poorly sewn. I assumed there would be lining as was shown in the picture, but there was no lining. I bought the same looking dress (same style and print) from another seller and it was lined and better quality."
3.0,"These are very unique earrings, I really like the spiral pair. The other pair seemed to have a sharp edge on the end, so it hurt when I put them on. And apparently I am a bit allergic to whatever they are made of."
3.0,Were given for gifts.  To runners
3.0,"I wear a women's size 9.5 and am 5'10.  I have never checked my calf size, but based on the shoe size alone, I needed to purchase a size M/L.  These socks are HUGE on my feet. The heel of the sock is near my Achilles tendon which is not providing any compression. Also, the socks are so long they go over my knees, but not far enough to stay up all day, so I have to roll them down which gives me a large indentation and is painful at the end of the day. If you purchase these, you're better off getting a small size, and if you have small feet, these probably won't fit well at all. Good luck!"
3.0,I wasn’t blessed like most women (small A) and the medium was the best fit but was too tight on the ribs. The large was too big on my chest but just right on the ribs. Im 5’2 and 120 lbs. I’m athletically built so it just wasn’t working for me but it was made well so hopefully it will work for someone else.
3.0,Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loved them but the leverback hook is way too short and small.  My daughter does not have large ear lobes and they would not go all the way through!  These look like they would fit a small child and not made for adult ears.  Sadly we send them back for a refund.
3.0,These are really cute but they are really dull. The colors aren’t very vibrant at all.
3.0,"I love the size of this bag and the zippered top and pockets. I was hoping it had a fabric exterior but it's a plastic-like material which makes the bag smell like plastic. Overall, the bag is great for what I needed."
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress...BUT it smelled horrible, like an old moldy basement?!? It came w another dress that smelled even stronger. I wasn’t sure washing it would remove the smell so I returned it. Maybe they aren’t all like that? I was sad bc this dress has POCKETS, had a nice soft stretchy type material and is a pretty blue color. The belt that came with it is useless tho and there was something weird happening w the ruffle at the top where the button is. Part of it was disconnected but I couldn’t tell why? Like it was sewn that way but didn’t make sense as to why? Lol"
3.0,Fits almost a adult head
3.0,"I was disappointed with the style of this dress, and will be returning it.  My biggest complaint is that it is not as full or poofy as it appears in the picture.  It is actually rather flimsy.  It's not terrible (I'd put it above your normal Wal-mart costume), but it does look a little cheap.  It is just one piece of material with a shorter overlay of material on top.  Although this scalloped overlay does go around the whole dress, the pretty gold pattern is on the front only....the back is not very pretty. I had originally ordered a different Belle dress by Creative Education that unfortunately turned out to be way too big, and the smaller size was no longer available...so I was bought this Little Adventures dress....big disappointment.  I would highly recommend the Creative Education version, which is beautiful, three layers of poofy material, and well made.<br /><br />On a positive note, the dress does appear well made and comfortable.  It has no velcro or zippers, it just slips over your head.  The material is actually soft (for a costume).  If you are looking for comfort over appearance, you might be happy with this dress.  I was looking for something different."
3.0,THE FIT IS PHENOMENAL AND SO IS THE MATERIAL FEEL YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WITH SNAGGING IT ON A BRACELET.  A PULLED STRING WILL MEAN AN IMMEDIATE HOLE IN MATERIAL!  ONLY DOWNFALL!  I EMAILED THE SELLER AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE...
3.0,IT is a cute dress it is small around the arms. I'm 5'3 & 214 lbs. I got the XL it is snug on my arms but I have big arms. The closure in the back the pattern does not line up so it looks cheap. the material is thick and I like the pockets overall for the price this dress works!
3.0,"Love the style, but a bit small in the arms.  I am a regular size 6."
3.0,"They are light weight and basic. You can see through the fabric if you hold them up to your face. One shirt, after being washed and dried for the first time, had a finger nail sized hole in it...have no idea how it happened."
3.0,"Looks like in the photo. Wish they were a bit tighter. My only complaint about these were the clasps. I wore one to Disneyland, and every time I would sit down and get up for a ride, the belt would unclasp itself. It was incredibly annoying and I almost lost it a couple times because of it. Ultimately I ended up giving them away for a better quality belt."
3.0,It's okay. The support is fantastic. The double hinge in the back is kind of annoying and hard to reach to top one. It's a little itchy but I expect that may go away after a few washes.
3.0,"Awkward fit, not a loose jogger but more of a loose legging. Very weird. I returned."
3.0,This dress is petite which I am not- I was recommended to buy a size up to accommodate for this but that didn’t cut it. This dress is super tight & super short. I have a larger bust so maybe it’d work for someone with a smaller chest or someone actually petite like directed 😉 Decent material though!
3.0,This is a beautiful top. Unfortunately I have to return it because it’s a little tighter around the shoulders than I would have liked.
3.0,"Let me start out by indicating that I normally wear a medium in tops and size 12 in pants, so how do I choose? The description reads ""We Suggest That You have Your Body Measurements Taken First, And Then Refer To Our Size Chart..."". I couldn't find a ""Size Chart"" in the listing that would detail my measurements and suggest a size, so I went with the ""Large (US 12-14)"" that I saw in the description. Well, I probably should have gone with the medium.<br /><br />The sleeves keep falling off of my shoulder. Also, the sleeves are really bulky. Too much material. The picture in the listing ""looks tight"" in comparison to the actual dress that I received. I am a 36DD and the under-boob seam rides up. You can even see this in the photos at the top of the Amazon listing. Pictures in the middle of the listing are of smaller girls and the seam sits better.<br /><br />I couldn't tell from the pictures at the top of the listing, but the material is baby ribbed. I looked through the description and only found ""This Pink ribbed knit dress flatter..."" but I'm not sure what ""Pink ribbed"" means (I had selected the beige color). After another look at the listing, I saw a few bubble enlargements. One showed ""Knit Fabric..."" and it kinda shows the ribbed texture, but you really can't determine the size of the ribs.<br /><br />Now, when you climb into this dress (I found it easier to pull up versus pull over), it is really long, and clingy. I don't have a perfect body for this type of fit, but as you start to gather the material and shorten the length, it starts to disguise and hide the problem areas. I found that the best way to ruche the look is to put on the dress and just pull the strings downward. I starts the gathering just below the armpit and goes from there. You then gather the rest of the material to match the sides. BTW - The clingy fit was great at the bottom since I made the length just cover my butt and the dress just naturally tucked under.<br /><br />I really wanted this dress to work. If the top was better proportioned, it might have been a winner. I thought about a smaller size to help with the shoulders, but then the under-boob seam would probably come up even more. Ok well, better luck with the next one...<br /><br />I hope you liked my review and I hope it helped with your purchase decision. Please let me (and Amazon) know if it did. Thanks!"
3.0,"Not thick at all. Not made to fit smaller children, my child is 6 and it falls off her face."
3.0,They're okay. They aren't the cosplay &#34;sexy&#34; look that I was going for but they're nice to put under jeans in the winter and they keep my lower leg warm.
3.0,"The heart design on it wasnt very obvious in the picture, if I knew that it was much bolder in real life I do not believe I would have bought it. The material is also quite thin, if you're buying this for another layer of clothing for the cold, you could do much better."
3.0,Cute but per the packaging the face mask is 19cm by 13cm not 18cm by 11cm. The fabric is more like a cloth and doesn’t have filter pockets.
3.0,It’s a cute watch and goes with anything casual.
3.0,Was expecting a shiner silver
3.0,"With the right measurement, this is a beautiful suit.  The top was too snug for me, and unfortunately, they didn't have one in my size."
3.0,I agree with another reviewer looks cheap and feels cheap with a sticker slap on it
3.0,Buen producto pero esperaba una mejor calidad
3.0,I’m so loving the color of this night gown & the fit of this gown. but I’m just going suggest if you order this night gown I think in my opinion you may have to go down a size because it stretches out from wearing & washing it. the top part of gown is smaller than the bottom tho. after washing it to me the color holds real good just don’t do what did i was cleaning something wit bleach in it & ruined it so I had to order another one
3.0,I give this product a 3 because I ordered it for my daughter coming in November and there just a bigger size then expected! My 5 year old is able to fit them no issues! They are super beautiful and would be happy to buy more of the products if they were abit smaller.
3.0,It did the job for what I needed it for but wasn’t what I expected
3.0,"The sizing on this set is odd. I normally wear a size small. From what I could tell, it seemed like it ran small in the top, so I went with a medium.<br />The bottoms fit pretty good. I think a small would have been okay, but the medium still works. The soft flocking lining feels really nice. So for fit, I'm happy with the bottoms. What I don't like about the bottoms is that even though they have that touch of a lining, the fabric is still ultra thin. If you are comfortable with going in public with every little flaw (or perfection depending on your view) for all to see, then you probably wont mind how thin the fabric is. Also, unless you want people to see your panties, I'd suggest wearing a nude thong.<br />The top fits me, but it is a tad tight. I am a 34A in most cases. Occasionally I find I need a 36A in brands that run small. The elastic on the top is very narrow, so it creates a fine line of pressure which is not comfortable. A wider softer band would have been preferable.<br />The manufacture would have done better to sell each piece separately. After all, some of us have a ample backside & no chest (me), some of us have no backside & a huge bosom, some of us have it all, & finally some us have nothing. We woman rock. We are all unique & beautiful in our own way. Clothing manufactures need to figure this out.<br />Overall, if you are able to get the proper fit & don't mind how thin this is, you should be happy. I'm wearing the shorts around my home & for yoga & working out. I'm not sure what to do with the top. I have much more comfortable tops, so I see no reason to wear one that is not as comfortable as they are."
3.0,It's okay. It is made well but pretty thin material they used for it.
3.0,Really too big  it hurt when I wear them
3.0,"I will say that the fit is good and they’re comfortable however, just like a few other reviews I’ve read, pantiliners do not stick. There is no discernible crotch. I am thinking I will have to get some cotton material and sew it into the crotch just so I can wear a pantiliner. So frustrating!"
3.0,Runs big according to the size chart they post.
3.0,The quality was fine but the chain was too short.  I have returned it for the next size.
3.0,Color was a bit off to me .. Sent back for refund.<br /><br />Size was accurate and looks just as pictured.
3.0,"Fit is small.  Material feels cheap.  Cut is nice.  Definitely an Asian sizing.  Buy a size bigger, maybe two."
3.0,Overall it fits just not as loose as what I expected
3.0,"I am use to Columbia fleece jackets. These are less fitting, bulky. They are warm but the fleece is a lower quality."
3.0,"This is a cute bolero, but it is mot made out of chiffon. This is made from 4way stretch mesh. Like what one would make parts of a gymnastic, skating, or dance outfit from. The fit is good, but not really what i was looking for."
3.0,"It's ok, kind of thin cotton, like walmart quality."
3.0,"When I initially received these I thought they were great.  But after wearing these the top seams have become unraveled.  The panties have become loose and easily roll down constantly,  which causes extreme aggravation to no end!"
3.0,"They’re what I expected for the cheap price, but the pants are cut oddly and so short, which makes them look web! If they were longer and didn’t look like they shrunk even with a size larger, maybe even 2 sizes larger, than normal, they still look shrunken and short, even though they fit even a tad loose at the waist, they’re short aka my Dad would call them “floods” LOL!"
3.0,"The strings on this come off all of the time and so the bottom doesn't last long looking very nice. That being said, I still absolutely love it and it is gorgeous!"
3.0,"I have bought chiffon material shirts before and have not had them be this see through, kind of cheaply made, however will do."
3.0,"It's an okay purchase. I expected it to be smaller, and the material seems cheaper then the image shown. the insides were a bit of a hassle to adjust all my stuff, such as my ID, and other various cards."
3.0,Bottle hard to squeeze.
3.0,"It was okay.. I wouldn't recommend it honestly. Didn't wow me.<br />Pattern ends up being weird and the dress is just like I said, simply okay..."
3.0,I went with exact size of the last order. Not a good idea.
3.0,That cap it’s sort
3.0,"Handle carefully.  They need backs, because they slip out easily.  Both earings broke while I was trying to get a back on.....they are pretty tho"
3.0,"I wear a medium but this was a bit big on me so I gave it to my friend who wears a large and worked for her. The only disappointing thing were the patches on the elbows, they are not positioned on the elbow like the photo they show, more like farther down the arm so they look oddly placed."
3.0,The reviews seem skewed. Most of the people writing reviews received the glasses for free. They're cheaply made. I returned them and got a pair of oakleys for $75 more and it's worth the extra money.
3.0,Please note as the seller says that this item uses Asian sizes not American... I ended up with something too small for me because I did not pay attention!
3.0,"Bought this for vacation, and I never took it out of my suitcase. Just too small for the family resort I was at."
3.0,Excellent graphics but very small fit. This was a Christmas gift. After washing it shrunk so now this doesn't accurately fit the gift recipient. Wish I'd ordered a size up.
3.0,"This blouse is pretty, but it is a bit stiff.  It does not hang well on the body."
3.0,I used it once and didn't get impressed. The product is okay to use but just feel like it's a regular material which is being used from the leftover. No offense to the seller but I didn't like the product.
3.0,"I really liked the design of this purse. The pockets are fantastic and functionally it WAS on par with some of my $100+ Bagallini purses--for about two weeks. I initially got this as a cheap accessory to match a dress I was wearing to a friend's wedding but liked it so much that it became my main purse. The problem is, it's a cheap purse. After just a few weeks, the inner lining separating the outside zipper pocket from the innermost body of the purse tore, combining the two compartments. It's still usable, and I like the purse enough that I'm going to see if I can repair it somehow, but the fact remains it's a cheap purse that couldn't withstand daily use."
3.0,NEEDS  a bigger snap belt.  Difficult snapping close once you put your cards in. Also needs to be a bit longer to accommodate paper money.... you have to crunch the bills to get them to fit.....if both were corrected it would be perfect.  But it is smaller and lighter.
3.0,"Cute blouse, the picture does look a little different like it has a purple-is hue to it in the picture, however the blouse is bright white in person. It wasn't what I was expecting but still very cute."
3.0,This top was awkward and I couldn’t figure out how to wear it. I ended up sending it back.
3.0,"The leggings were nice and soft so that is why I give it 3 stars. I got them in the 7-14 size, but they definitely start more at a 10 no so much a 7."
3.0,"Not what I expected, no lining, a bit flimsy."
3.0,"It is nice, but the day I got it, I opened the wallet and the little clip broke off. As in, the leather strap just broke, as if it were extremely brittle. However, the rest of the wallet is great, and has been working very well."
3.0,"Runs very small. Very cute pattern, adorable styled dress, just runs very small, several sizes smaller."
3.0,Site tab about a size smaller than expected and was narrow in the toe
3.0,"this cardign is nice, but it runs big, you have to fool with it to make it look good and also it was missing a tassel so it looks like it has a hole  had to saw together."
3.0,I literally own 6 pairs of IZIPIZI - they're fun colors and great glasses. But why oh why do the frames crack. And I take excellent care of my glasses - I have 3 pairs of readers (one that I keep at my work desk - and yet it still cracked and I barely wear them). And I own 3 sunglasses - those don't seem to snap as easily as my sunglasses seem to be ok. It's disappointing...
3.0,"Nice construction and the waist was the correct size.  However, the legs were way too tight.  For my waist size the should expect larger legs."
3.0,They were thin and silky feeling. You had to put a filter in them that was rough like sandpaper and was up against you face.
3.0,"To small, but I have really thick dreads. If I had normal hair, would totally fit. Artwork is dope"
3.0,This outfit is really cute I’ve washed is a few times without any issues BUT the hold for the neck is slightly small if your child has a lot of hair its going to be a slight struggle to get it on. Other than that we haven’t had any issues.
3.0,Looks great in the picture but super thin.  It cost more to send it back than to keep it.  Money tossed out!
3.0,"I love the style of this dress and it was for a Halloween costume so it really wasn't a big deal that it was too short. But if that bothers you, for sure get a size up."
3.0,"I purchased this dress hoping to wear it to church, but I cannot. It is TOO short. I am 5'9 and 167lbs.<br />The actual fit of the church was great but the length was not."
3.0,Cute slippers. Rather thin and cheap material  Will not last long
3.0,Earrings are fine but took over a month to get here just to see they were from china. Tossed in the trash!
3.0,I like the 18 Karat gold look but they are way too small. It look like they should be for a child.
3.0,"I love the look of it, but it keeps opening on it's own, which is quite annoying."
3.0,I love this shirt however it flares out on a awkward part of my body which is fine because I can have it talerd. All in all it was worth the buy.
3.0,"This item was in good condition, but it didn't fit quite like I pictured. It's a little short and just seems kind of costume-ish. My husband decided not to wear it for our vow renewal."
3.0,it was ok but it was pretty darn short
3.0,These are cute but a lot of them are not centered and you cannot see that it's actually a cat..
3.0,"Way too small, I ordered blue color in size 3/4 120, and it could barely fit a 24 months old.  The color matched the picture, it was pretty, but extremely tiny."
3.0,I got this one really late. It took over a month to arrive but it is cute and a nice mask. Too bad halloween is over and it's pretty much useless.
3.0,"The straps are detachable at the back for some reason (whole strap DOES NOT come off for a strapless look, so...why??) and pop out everytime I put it on.  So far hasn’t been an issue while wearing, but it seems like a dumb product design and it makes me nervous"
3.0,"Again another &#34;not bad, not great&#34; product. I bought this because I'm pregnant and if I wasnt laid back about maternity clothes, I would probably return this one. I got an XL,which is enormous even with my 19week belly but that is to be expected somewhat. the real issue is the color -- &#34;swamp water&#34;? &#34;diarrhea&#34;? &#34;black eye bruise&#34;? i cant even tell you, but if its supposed to be some variation of &#34;green&#34; they missed the mark by a whole freakin continent."
3.0,Meh not too happy with the look on me. Looks super baggy. Not flattering like in the picture.
3.0,"Just ok. Nice that it isn’t totally see through, but for the price I was expecting a lot better quality. These should not be priced higher than $15-20 range IMO. They just are not that nice to justify a higher price-point I paid for them. So yeah a little disappointed and feeling like I got a little ripped off."
3.0,Material stretches out very quickly.
3.0,Got these to use as extra decor for our Easter celebration.. I ended up not useing them. They looked kind of cheap. I only pulled one out of the package and was like ehhh.. probably wouldn’t purchase again. Hope this helps.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:30eed6789126e895c902007da7a6fe5c]] Ordered turquoise, as the sticker shows, and received gold/black. At least the length was the one I wanted. Pretty close if not spot on when applying tension. Seem like they are made of good quality. There isn't too much flexibility/stretchability to the material so they should withstand quite a bit of abuse. Lets see how they fare against constant torching, carbon arc gouging and dual wire feeding on the Lincoln PowerWave S500. Just wish I could be turning heads to get the attention I deserve with the turquoise color."
3.0,Not as heavy as I was hoping for. Another brand was of better quality.
3.0,Claimed to be stainless steel but looks nothing like picture. It came looking dull and tarnished.
3.0,"This shirt is very soft and fits great but this is what happened on the second time I wished it. It’s got a very grungy look to it anyway so I’ll continue to wear it but nowhere in the car instructions did it say how to avoid this. The rainbow is basically melted to the other side and I had to rip it to get it a part, leaving residue on the rainbow."
3.0,This cooler is nice for keeping refreshments during a road trip. It's not big so it doesn't take a lot of space. The cooling system it's on the inside making the cooler small in its capacity.
3.0,For being a 16g its a little smaller in the mm part of the size not like 10mm
3.0,Nice fit even for my big head.
3.0,Not as cute in person.. The color was a bit dingy looking and more old fashioned looking than trendy. Material was decent and not see thru. I sent it back but I suppose if it was worn with the right shoes and accessorized it could be cute. I just found it a bit too boxy and overall not as cute or flattering as pictured. I ordered a small and it was a bit big but fit fine I am about 5'5 and 128lbs.
3.0,"The quality is not so great. When shirt arrived, one side was noticeably baggier than the other. Poor, rushed sewing job. Wanted to mend it and adjust myself, but decided it wasn’t worth it for a $20 top. I could get better quality at a regular department store.<br />The major plus is that seller is quick to ship and communicate, and there’s a range of options to pick from."
3.0,"These don’t have much stretch or give. I normally wear large in spandex workout leggings but these in large feel too tight. I can’t breathe or move comfortably like in spandex. The material is soft but confining and not very stretchy. I like them enough to keep them and deal with them, but they’re not comfortable enough to order again or recommend to others. When I walk, exercise or lounge, I don’t want anything binding me and these definitely feel too tight."
3.0,"The size fits as expected, but it thought it would lay differently."
3.0,Simple<br />Acceptable
3.0,The shirts are sized small. Large is usually a little baggy and it was so tight I couldn't button any of the buttons!
3.0,Not flexible enough to fit 20mm space OR off by a nano of a mm that it would not fit
3.0,"Ordered for work (dialysis nurse). I want to love it; it feels sturdy & high-quality, I like the design, etc.<br />It's unusable for me. It slides down my nose constantly, and if I even slightly tilt my head/lean down, it falls right off. It's way too big - and I have a big head! If I could get it in a smaller size, I'd buy it again immediately."
3.0,Too small but nicely constructed
3.0,"I am bit disappointed at the bangle. First I agree with another review who said there is no way to adjust it. There isn't. Not that I need since my wrist is really thin, but it seems quite misleading.<br />Second, I understand the stones are not going to be all the same size, but on mine, the difference on their height is so noticeable that even my fianc&eacute; could not miss. :)<br />Finally, the clasp is not the easiest or well thought-out, meaning if you want to wear it every day, you will likely find yourself struggling to put it back.<br />I don't think it was worth the price.<br /><br />Update: 06/15: The company contacted me immediately upon my review and offered me a partial refund for the piece. Although it did not solve the issue, I must cumpliment their customer service. I also noticed they removed the `adjustable' entry on the title."
3.0,"The elastic is not quite enough to hold the leg warmers up.  Works ok, not great."
3.0,Cute pjs however the adult sizes are super small so definitely size up. I ordered for my baby and the product is so cheaply made that when I tried unsnapping the buttons to change my baby that the snaps just ripped off from the clothing!!!
3.0,"I bought these post breast reduction and I was pleased with them the first couple weeks. After that, the front zipper would not stay up in any of the three bras in my order. No matter which way the zipper was pointed or situated, it would slowly start unzipping (at very awkward times) and eventually become all the way unzipped. They’re very comfortable bras but I had to stop wearing them since I couldn’t ever be sure my breasts weren’t going to fall out of my bra mid conversation."
3.0,"Although the quality is superb, I ordered a size xx-large (14?). However, what I received may actually be a small, or x-small, but there is no size label on the sweater itself or on the bag it came in, so I don't know what size they sent me. It is also very short not even to my waist. But more striking is the color. They called it rusty red and it is pictured as a lovely muted soft reddish color. However, it's a actually a  very bright vibrant red-orange. It's going back!"
3.0,Had some minor scratches on the glass surface. Over all it's exactly as I expected.
3.0,These are beautiful boots and very well made but they're SO uncomfortable that I had to get rid of them.  I wear boots with similar heel height to work several times a week and have never had a problem so I wasn't at all prepared for how much discomfort I felt wearing these.
3.0,"I love this little music box. It’s cute, compact and a nice knickknack to set on a table. I bought it for my grandchildren. Unfortunately it’s a bit fragile even though it’s plastic. After five minutes one of them dropped it, and the edge of the lid broke. So even though it’s plastic, it now has a bit of a sharp jagged edge. I would not have expected the plastic to break so easily."
3.0,"stylish but not this much i like it ... even it come with a bad packing , howeverfor this price its ok"
3.0,It is smaller that I thought and the fabric is what I hoped
3.0,"The material was not as soft as I would have liked, and the skirt part started higher on me than what appears in the photo, and I'm not a tall person (5' 3&#34;). It is very cute though. I returned it as it was a tad too small. I usually take a small or medium, and the medium of this dress was too snug."
3.0,It fit well looks OK basically everything fine and good unfill I washed it after using two weeks or so. And after first machine washing it discolored right away.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this.  Unfortunately, it was too big for me.  Even at the smallest setting it kept moving around.  The breathable mesh was not so breathable in a Texas summer evening.  My back was heating up quickly.  I finish a three mile jog and the backpack was off my mile two.  Great concept but it did not work out for me."
3.0,While It was leather it looked cheap like “pleather”
3.0,I bought this for my mom (in a 3X) who wears a US 2X. It fits me barely across the chest - I wear a US 10/12. Buyers beware!!! It is otherwise attractive but fails on sizing!!!!
3.0,"Instead of a cord to lace up the waist, like it shows in the photos, it came with a folded piece of material or bias.  This will just wear out and doesn't look proper with the dress."
3.0,"Nothing wrong with the tail so far, just had the wrong impression of how big it was going to be- I read the description of the product but I was still expecting it to be a bit more full like the picture. I intended to use it for a costume I was making but it's really only for a purse or backpack accessory."
3.0,"This is pretty and fun! It will not last a lifetime, nor will it become a family heirloom. At this price you can buy it for the kids for dress up!! And at some point, when a post breaks off, grab the hot glue gun and glue it onto the side of a sword for your son. Fashion jewelry-- at a fun price. Started with the one with the brown stones, and a boyfriend bought me the one with the blue stones, and also the one with the leaves. The one with the leaves required tools to reassemble after shipping. It has an interesting elegance to it that is nice as well."
3.0,Arrived in time. I bought it for gym use which is okay. Medium is little bit went big for me. Overall in this price okay
3.0,"The pattern and materiel are good, but seem like it fit only skinny long legs who is 5’.5” and up .. I’m 5’1” and have big thigh and hip but, I ware Xsmall. Even though,  I can’t even pull the pants up. It stuck on my thigh."
3.0,"The laces are blue and do not really match the shoe. They run pretty narrow, but are cute."
3.0,"I like the design of the dress, as it hugs the body well, is a great rich color, soft stretchy fabric, but I hate the two different pieces in the front that create two different hem lines. Every time I sit, the dress parts and almost leaves my lady bits exposed. I love the top and defined waist, but the bottom of the dress drives me crazy."
3.0,"I love the design and colors of this purse. It's a fantastic statement piece.  I'm not sure but maybe because it's hand sewn it did this, but within the first week the shoulder strap started to unravel. (It was the last one in this color so I couldn't exchange it) I ended up sewing it up and it was fine. But now there are strings coming out from various areas. Again it's a great purse but mine just seems to be falling apart."
3.0,fits perfect and felt good but the front zipper did not last long.
3.0,"XL, fits more like Large/Medium"
3.0,"The material is great, soft. The color is just as pictured. I want to keep this but can't.  Why? The cup size is for nothing bigger then a B. My 34d look awkward. It fits my waist but I'm pouring out in front and especially the sides. Sad."
3.0,"The top is a nice regular black top however the bottom piece is far too small. I'm regularly an XS for bottoms, and this was srill unimaginably tight"
3.0,I’m so sad. I LOVED this dress but the black faded so quickly. I couldn’t wear it as a new dress somewhere now if I wanted and am saving it for errands and home. 😢
3.0,Fits me nice but u get what u pay for cheap material almost looks like under slip very see thru but still an ok casual dress
3.0,Lenses are made of plastic not glass!!! Very very disappointed!!!!!!! Will never buy from this vendor. Must be Chinese or India.
3.0,Super cute and comfy but it didn't take long for the fabric to develop holes.
3.0,I have a very average sized face but these are way too small. Had to take off the nose pieces and they aren't the same glasses without them.  Bummer!!
3.0,"The color was beautiful. Material decent, nice dress overall. I am consistently a small/xs (2/4) in clothes. I ordered a small without looking at the measurements since it says 4/6. I could have worn it possibly but it was SO tight. I went back and ordered a medium which did fit better but was then longer than I wanted. I would warn do NOT go by size, go by measurements listed. Their measurements put me between a medium and large. I ended up returning after I found a dress I liked better. Overall a pretty dress, just be cautious of sizing."
3.0,too tight.  Not queen sized.  Pretty!
3.0,"Bought these for teacher Christmas gifts... They're very cute and they're nice and big, but a couple of them are a little scratched."
3.0,They are too tight
3.0,"It is sturdy, but very plain and looks like inexpensive leather."
3.0,"Not for petite. Not for 5 feet 2 &#34; women. Very long. Quality is good , fabric is good in touch. Yellow is brighter than picture but good."
3.0,"While I loved the outfit itself the first two times I wore it, I was disappointed how it held up.  It looked like it had been worn several times  The white ran and it just looked frumpy"
3.0,Received jacket that was very small. Was suppose to be US large size. YIDI did issue me a refund. I am satisfied.
3.0,"I received the product very quickly but unfortunately the product didn't look as much like the picture as I'd hoped. There was more shading on the ball, obsuring it slightly. and, the t-shirt is fairly thin in quality. Understandable for the price I suppose."
3.0,It's a very nice necklace but it's not the cream color that's in the picture so it's somewhat misleading like another buyer stated. It's nice so I'll keep it I just hope I can match it with things!
3.0,"This is a cute, comfortable ring which I enjoy. However, the glitter that I thought was inside the ring is really almost just sprinkled on the outside and it’s rubbing off at an alarming rate. I’ve only worn this ring once and the glitter is already almost completely worn off. So that’s upsetting."
3.0,"Did not like that the box looked repackaged and retaped/misshapen; because they are individually wrapped, did not return."
3.0,I wore this dress for Christmas. It fits very well. Tight fitting crunches in the back area. The only thing I didn't like about this dress was it was very see thru. For the price its what I expected. So I only wore it that 1 time. But don't get me wrong it looks very nice on.
3.0,beads are falling had to glue them back on
3.0,"I really wanted to love this dress. The pattern was really pretty and although the material was a little strange, it was soft and shiny and looked good for the style of dress. The plunge neckline revealed more clevage than I was comfortable with (I'm a DDD) and the back of the dress featured this elastic which aids in the fit of the dress but also unfortunately created this baggy look on me. The straps are really thin and are more like an elastic cord than actual straps. Overall I'm sure the dress would look good on some people, but it was a miss for me."
3.0,Very very thin flannel material.
3.0,Runs much smaller than expected
3.0,"All the videos you see of this bra is such lies. Yes you can rope then up but if you have breast it will rip after a few uses. Also, cannot wear in the summer or any hot atmosphere because it’s going to come right off. Not exactly sure how to wear this it’s been sitting in my room"
3.0,These are okay in my opinion.  My number one complaint is that they stretch at the bottom where it meets your calf.  And I don't love the material.
3.0,Material is okay but slides down as you workout.
3.0,"If shipping didn't cost as much as the item, I'd say it's worth the cost at least. But realistically, this is not very good quality. The threading strips after 2 uses, and if you don't take it out before eating, you may swallow it. Each time I've forgotten to take it out, I ended up with it broken in my mouth. The only good part is you get 4 of them, and they aren't very visible in comparison to others I've tried. Just don't expect to use this long term."
3.0,This fit as expected but I find it a bit itchy. I've worn the exact same hoodie (or so I think) that I bought years ago in the store but I felt that one was more comfortable. Perhaps this one needs to be broken in or perhaps I've been spoiled by the much softer ones I've bought recently at J Crew.
3.0,"This dress didn’t fit me well and I had to return it. The top/waist was too small and the dress was well past my knees (I’m 5’1”). The sleeves were almost too tight, so i don’t want to order the next size down, because although the waist might fit better, the sleeves will be too small."
3.0,"Style is excellent , good lens protection"
3.0,"The sizing charts are not very helpful.  These tops run small.  Since I was unsure of what size to order, I followed the sizing chart and ordered an XL, unfortunately, it appears that you order in US sizing and they ship a larger size to accommodate for the size difference.  Needless to say the size I received was way too large, so I had to return them.  Still unsure of what size I need to achieve the compression needed for my Lymphedema.  I assume I will order Large the next time.  Other than the sizing issue, they appear to be of quality so I will definitely try them again."
3.0,"I like the material of this shirt, however the recommendation says order your normal size but for me I would say go down a size unless you have a large upper body I.e breast."
3.0,The material is spandex and thin.  But it is a cute pattern.  I am nursing so it was too tight in the chest.  I returned it.
3.0,"Very pretty set, but stones fell out by end of the night and part of the necklace broke."
3.0,It is light for the shape and kind of pinching skin but looks pretty good. Colors are nice. I say it is OK not super great but considering the price... OK
3.0,Cute for dress up but not the best quality
3.0,"Loved the bag when it first arrived, but after only 3 months of &#34;normal&#34; use (everyday to work bag, I carry a 15&#34; laptop computer and 2-3 thick files) the shoulder strap clips are broken.  The bag will not sit upright, no matter how I arrange the items. Otherwise, material is holding up well no &#34;wear marks&#34; and easily wipes clean with damp cloth."
3.0,"Good quality &#34;Santa hat&#34;, but way too big for the average sized head. When I wear it, the awesome Liverpool logo can't even be seen. The top just covers it, no matter what I do."
3.0,Very thin and much more &#34;A-cut&#34; than expected
3.0,"Broke after 2 months, had not been used more than a handful of times. The child opened the arms of the glasses a bit too far and SNAP. Disappointed as these were very cute. The same child plays with our adult pairs and has never damaged them, they’re just too big for wear."
3.0,Good price good materials just a bit long hopefully they will shrink after washing several times
3.0,I cannot rate this purchase because it is a gift for Christmas.
3.0,"The product is nice, fits as expected. I gave it 3 stars because it came with lipstick stains on the front part, had to wash it a couple of times to get them out. Too bad they don’t check the product prior to sending it."
3.0,Did not find them long enough for my taste.
3.0,"I really wanted to give these a higher review.  They look great on me, but after 3 wears, they are ripping at the seams in the crotch area.  A waste of money.  The jeggings at Target are studier and look great too, just not as polished as these.  I do still wear them since they are comfy but I wear a long sweater.  For info purposes I am 5-9, 160lb, and workout 6 days a week,  so perhaps if you are smaller without a bootie, you won't have this issue."
3.0,"Gorgeous frame, looks amazing on my round chubby face!<br />Sadly, the little screw came loose pretty quickly, I lost it and didn’t want to go through a trouble of finding a new one and repairing the glasses. The glasses lasted about 2 months."
3.0,"Very pretty dress. I was disappointed it was too small. I ordered a Large and I ordered a burgundy dress in another brand in large but made the same. Burgundy one fit well. Flowered one is too small. Leaves a lot of my neck and shoulders exposed. Unfortunately, I did not get it returned in the month time and I have to keep it with no chance of wearing it."
3.0,This is for the &#34;Kid&#34; she wants the aviator style but with a twist.
3.0,I was so excited when it arrived  Its not as comfortable as I hoped for.
3.0,"So I ordered this dress for my bridal shower. I wish I would have read the reviews first before purchasing. Definitely order one size smaller. I’m usually a large in dresses I have thick thighs, big hips and a big butt. So I always buy large in dresses. Well when my dress came in it was super baggy and loose. I was a bit sad only because I decided to try it on the day of my bridal shower so I had to try and safety pin the sides. The dress is beautiful don’t get me wrong I just wish I would have seen the reviews first and ordered a size smaller"
3.0,"I bought these right before my trip to Hawaii. They were comfortable and fit well except for the fact that they don't have any indentation for the back of your foot so your heal kinda just slides off and rest at an angle, maybe its cause they fit snugly and the straps pull you foot at that angle so you might want to get a half size bigger than you normally would. It was pretty annoying to walk anymore than just around the house in these."
3.0,Bought this to wear with a backless dress. The cup fit well but it’s not strong enough to support a D size cup. Also noticed that it did shift and move with sweating.
3.0,I ordered the size based on the chart but the dress is a little more snug fitting than I prefer. I ordered a large should have ordered an extra large.
3.0,I was smaller than I thought and was very clingy
3.0,They were a little smaller than I hoped for but then again my septum piercing hole is a little far up so that could be part of the issue
3.0,"Bought these and they are great but needed next smaller size.... I am 6' 1"", 220 pounds, 38 inch waist... I ordered a large and they fit but provide no compression.  I like them, but would have to have a medium in order for them to work as compression shorts... (I have not worn a medium since 9th grade).  I like the pocket - it is on the hip (not front or back) which seemed weird until I got used to it.  I like it... :"
3.0,"It looks really pretty! The tentacle itself has sharp pieces sticking out of the underside of it. I also wasn't able to get the tentacle to fit, the bar wasn't quite long enough to fit."
3.0,"I kind of knew what I was going to get as far as quality based on price. I’m usually a M, but should have ordered L. Not super sheer, but w the stretch, you can def see bra outline/shadow- but not that bad. I purchased these to be undershirts so that doesn’t bother me. Overall satisfied, only complaint is that they took almost 2.5 weeks to be delivered."
3.0,Esta muy fresca pero se cae a la cara muy fácil
3.0,Love the fact that you cannot see it with layers of clothes perfect for what I needed it and love the feel of it. Does fall off after several times using it and need to clean it when that happen afterwards it holds and does what it supposed to.
3.0,"It fits just right, except zipper broke after 2 zips"
3.0,Very VERY small. But pretty. My hands are small and thin and the rings I just serve in the small finger.
3.0,Wore 5 times and arm broke off!  I liked the fit and they looked nice... But should not break that easy... But I sent message to company and they are sending me a new pair:)
3.0,"I really like it, but one thing to complain is the buckle is not flatted."
3.0,The width of these band are narrower than explained
3.0,"It pitches my neck, but because it's too small but the linking of the chains"
3.0,A little too big for me and the strap is too long
3.0,"I love the style & size of the wallet.  It has enough cc slots & compartments, but the interior is vinyl & not a high quality one at that.  I could live with vinyl, except there isn't much give to it.  It is also quite difficult to get my cards in & out of the slots.  Not sure if that is due to the vinyl or that the cards go in width wise instead of length.  All of my previous wallets the card went in length wise & it wasn't difficult to get them in & out.  It should have been mentioned in the description that the interior was vinyl."
3.0,Warm. Comfortable. Zipper malfunctions.
3.0,Awful fabric. Clings in all the wrong ways. Couldn’t get a bigger size in time. My daughter loves it but I didn’t like it at all.
3.0,Too large too long.
3.0,"While it is pretty and delicate, it bends easily where the leaves begin and I can see the leaves getting caught on a sleeve and even breaking off. This can't be for everyday wear and the price seems too high to me for the construction and wearability. (about $26) I'm disappointed as it was to be a graduation gift."
3.0,It gave my baby some sort of allergy.
3.0,The fit was a little loose....nice wide brim though
3.0,"I love this watch, however, after going on a walk my top chronograph button started to stop working every few times that I used it.  I think that this is a great watch, but it just did not end up being for me because of its malfunction."
3.0,The big diamond in the middle gets cloudy fast.
3.0,"The hat was cute, but the ribbon could have been better quality."
3.0,"In the photo it seems to be white, which is the color I prefer, instead of light blue."
3.0,I bought this for my 14 year old and it broke within hours of wearing it.
3.0,My dog's hair is very apparent on these. White hair. They are very thin material. They fit a little larger/baggier than anticipated.
3.0,"As far as headbands go, these are a little on the thin side which means they aren't that absorbent.  But for the price, I guess you can't complain too much."
3.0,I've been wearing these shoes for years all year around and always buy size 6. this time they were loose fitting. did you change manufacturers?
3.0,"Ok. I wasnt expecting too much, given the price. But not alot of feathers and can see the wire"
3.0,The top section of the dress was too tite. The material didnt have no give in it. The bottom or skirt part fits good.
3.0,"Great quality, but the size is too small. I have a 42&#34; chest and ordered a 44&#34; chest and it's still too small."
3.0,I got two of these for myself and daughter and we both have issues with them! The material is very nice and the look is adorable but the cup is almost nonexistent and it bunches you up in the back. We both have a very different body type so it’s not that it’s a familiar it’s just not a very good bra!
3.0,"Shorts fit a little smaller, and the top a little larger than I would have liked. If I could have selected each item individually, I would have had the top a size smaller and the shorts a size larger. The elastic in the shorts is VERY tight. The collar on the top is a bit awkwardly large and stiff. I've washed a few times and it still doesn't help."
3.0,The hat isn't as roomy as it appears in the photo. I have thick hair and chose this hat as it looked like it would not be too tight fitting. Disappointed.
3.0,"Didnt like the fit and finish of these. Didnt conform to my foot well, and it looked like the straps would break from the sole relatively easily. Returned"
3.0,"It's really boxy, not too much shape.  It will be okay under a blazer though."
3.0,Once they are on the glasses the glasses are not simple to put on. It would be nice in different colors.
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:a112fde3ea34ff73e16c4de1f0aa339d]] This chain has good shine, and the plating has not disappointed either.  However, one of the stones is crooked, and out of alignment, as seen in the picture.  Also, I know this is not apparent from the pictures, but sometimes during normal wear, the chain is not showing all the diamonds fully as it flips downward a bit, not completely over, but enough that it affects the chains shine.  For $34.88, I expect better craftsmanship on a small item like this.  That's my two cents."
3.0,"Ran very very large. I normally wear medium/large shirts, so ordered large because I was not sure if this was asian sized, but it was absolutely ginormously tent like. It looked like an xxl sleep shirt. The fabric is fairly stiff and thick. The green color was a little blah in real life. It could still be a cute shirt, but I would order at least a size smaller than your normal size."
3.0,"Like the color of the shirts and the size , I just have to say I should have went larger  going by the description I have to say not completely sure. 😍😯🙄"
3.0,started falling apart
3.0,"These glasses presented themselves with some significant problems. First, the picture shows clear, plastic lenses. When we received them, the lenses had painted letters from the manufacturer on them. A handful of cotton swabs and acetone nail polish remover took care of that issue. It was not easy but completely successful. The glasses were also very crooked. We had to take them to an optician for adjustment. In the optician's words, &#34;there was literally nothing right about these frames.&#34; With these two issues rectified, they are perfect; and daughter is delighted."
3.0,"I got these in the wrong color, but otherwise they're adorable and fit alright. Although the left one fits tighter and narrower than the right which is weird. Otherwise there are a cute buy."
3.0,"This is a great comfortable sweater, however, there is a stripe across the back of the sweater where the pattern changes and stands out pretty clearly. I wish it didn't have this defect, otherwise, would have given 5 stars."
3.0,"I washed the item before wearing, and was quite uncomfortable when I put it on. My entire back itched. I also could feel the nylon elastic under-seam, which made it worse. Very disappointed that it's not the comfort that I expected."
3.0,"Cute but runs small ,  I can barely move in it !"
3.0,"This was an okay pair of boots. I just wanted something to wear once in a while when going out with friends or to look a little less like a casual or work shoe/boot.<br /><br />These boots were a little tight in width and not the most durable of materials. If you plan to do a lot of walking, they're going to start to fall apart in my opinion. However, if you just want some thing that looks nice for a couple hours on a date or hanging out with friends, they're fine for that. They go well with a new pair of jeans, chinos, or khakis."
3.0,Beware if you have a larger face.  This mask is small.
3.0,"Returned, item received was wrong color and size"
3.0,"I am 6 '3&#34; tall and 190lbs. I normally wear 16-34/35 slim fit. I purchased the 5XL because I normally wear XL in US sizes. This fits well in the chest and waist, but it is a narrow in the shoulders. The sleeves also feel too short. The overall length is good, but it feels like it is missing a bottom button. The last button is about the same level as my belly button. The quality is good. The one I received is does not have a chest pocket. I wouldn't recommend this shirt to my tall friends."
3.0,somewhat big.
3.0,"The ZKHOECR tank top, in black zebra style looks better in the picture than it does in real life.<br /><br />This top is some type of polyester blend.  The one I received to review did not have a tag inside so I am not sure exactly what.  This is definitely not cotton.  This is more gray in the solid color part of the top than the picture would indicate.  The fabric looks as if it would pill easily.  The zebra stripe across the top is the nicest part of the top and looks like the picture does.<br /><br />The straps are larger than the picture would indicate and this is not form fitting at all. I'm pretty sure once I wash this a few times the gray color will fade even more, and the top will be barely useable.  I am only giving it three stars due to some people liking a top that is not form fitting.  Some people also like polyester blends, I normally am not one of them.  This shirt was not comfortable or attractive on me.  I would not buy this or recommend this top."
3.0,Mine came with a broken strap but it still works for what I need it for. So overall i'll give a 3.
3.0,"These pants fit but after a few washes they tend to shrink. I only experienced this with the white pants the other dark colors (navy, black) don't shrink after washing. They actually still fit well after numerous washes"
3.0,"I have worn these pairs of underwear several times now. I ordered a large when I usually take mediums. I think that the large's were a little bit big so I kind of wished I had ordered the mediums to see how those would have fit so its a little bit challenging to order the right size. Overall I think that the underwear is a good deal for the money but its nothing special at all. The material is comfortable, but most material is to me. The fit was OK. I don't think that they look great. Their OK."
3.0,The fit of the shorts where to small
3.0,It is very pretty. But it is easy to break if not really careful.
3.0,I like the look but not the engraving of the brand name on the lens😔
3.0,"I bought these boots in a size 7, and I usually wear a 6. They fit perfectly around my feet, but I feel like they taper a little too much around the ankles and calves, and they just don't look very flattering. I don't have very big calves and I feel like these boots just make my legs look thicker than they actually are because they are so tight around the ankle. These boots would be much cuter if the ankle part was not so skinny."
3.0,Shrinks up when washed. Goes from being a long t-shirt to barely covering the waist.
3.0,"Ordered a size larger and it was still too small. It shrinks a little in the wash and the material has no stretchability. Elastic bottom band rides up to my stomach. I recommended buying a really big one.<br /><br />Other than that, it's nice. The color is fine and the inner lining is soft and warm. Maybe if I removed the elastic band from inside the jacket to prevent it from riding up, it could be wearable even after shrinking."
3.0,"These are not boy shorts as advertised, they are a regular bikini cut. But I like the fit."
3.0,"It's cute, but the chest area is not accommodating for a large bust. Due to large bust size, I ordered the size large based on the size chart. It still was too tight, so it's not comfortable. If I had ordered an XL, then the tunic would look ridiculously huge on me... except then the bust probably would fit. I wouldn't recommend for busty ladies."
3.0,"nice top, green is to dark looks almost black, very soft, fabric needs to be handled carefully"
3.0,"Hat is ok. Fit is smaller then expected. Pretty warm.<br />However, after using it for the 2nd time, one of the buttons broke off.<br />Very disappointed and will think about returning.<br /><br />*Update 03/05/2018: I reached out to the seller and inform them of the defect on the hat. The seller responded quickly and offered me to purchase a 2nd hat for $.12. The 2nd hat also had quality issues. I would still recommend the hat as it is very warm."
3.0,Too small even though I ordered a 2x.<br />Did not fit at all.
3.0,"A little bigger than what is pictured.  I'll keep them, but not very satisfied"
3.0,I don't think these were worth the price :/ the cuff hurts my ear and is hard to put on and they're a little chunkier than they look in the picture. I don't love these
3.0,"This dress is beautiful! It’s floor length and has a flowy look. I gave it 3 stars because the color is not what it appears. We ordered the burgundy color and it’s more of a red than burgundy. The color doesn’t look like the picture. We were disappointed because it would have been prefect if it was really burgundy. We were buying it for a wedding, so the color matters.<br />The fit is great. It’s what my daughter usually wears. The sizing charts are very helpful. It has a lace up back so it can be adjusted tighter or looser."
3.0,"I bought this for my almost 4 year old who is wearing 4T. The dress is super cute but way to short, I ended up returning it"
3.0,"I used a dremel to engrave words related to my wedding on the temples for guest favors, and I want to say about 5 of glasses of the whole lot ended up peeling this ugly plastic coating. I had to run to the party store to replace the ruined pairs. Not every pair is the same, so consistency is lacking. I liked the bright colors and variety. I kept a few for personal keepsakes and have used them, but it seems that the screws can easily come out either with warning (if I was lucky to notice) or just popped out and was lost forever. Overall these are low quality, cheap sunglasses and I would not rely on them for long term use, but when they are in tact they are useful. You also would not feel guilty if you happened to lose a pair since they're low quality."
3.0,"Fits small, thought it would be loose fitting but seems to be more fitted then I like."
3.0,waist was not high
3.0,"Very small. I gave them to my daughter. Well made, arrived in a timely manner. Just very small."
3.0,I wanted a packable hat but it would be nice if it came into shape so you could wear it. It is permanently crushed. I can't get it to look anything like the man wearing it has it
3.0,Cute but huge... not what I expected so I've had a hard time wearing it but still cute
3.0,"Not leather as so many reviewers claim. Gave it three stars because the company made NO claims at all that the handbag was leather so it was not their fault I was lead to believe otherwise. Too orangish, so I sent it back."
3.0,"I like the shirt, the texted is just prefect for working out.<br /> My biggest issue is with the hood. It doesn't stay at the back as expected. The slightest of movement and this thing is breathing down my neck, hanging over my shoulders. I can't run in peace with this shirt because of the hood. I'm just about to rip off the hood. And I bought 3 of them 😥"
3.0,This watch is so cute but the metal has that cheap smell to it
3.0,It is comfortable and light
3.0,"Fabric texture was weird for a dress that looked fancy online.<br />If you're short, this will look weird on you"
3.0,Looks better in picture.
3.0,Beautifully mad but I ordered an XXL but it fit more like a M/L.  Very well made and I’ve been seeing since I was 6 years old.
3.0,"This crop top looks exactly as it does in the advertisements. It has a beautiful cut to it that is extremely flattering. When it came out of the package, it had a bad smell, which I assume is from the factory it came from it. I would recommend washing this before wearing. I ordered this top in white, and unfortunately it was a little see-through. If you wear a nude colored bra that fits well and is very close to your skin tone you may be able to get away with it, but I would recommend ordering this top in a darker color because you may not be comfortable wearing a lighter color out."
3.0,"Pants are great, hoodie arms are way short… wish I could just exchange the hoodie, also with they listed arm length in the size guide so I wouldn’t have wasted my time"
3.0,Very uncomfortable to wear and they change colors very quick
3.0,"I loved these at first, but after 1 wear they are tearing at the front, I can see the foam in-between the layers now.  Very cute, until the foam sticks out"
3.0,"the background color is not cream as I expected, is more of a greyish looking, but the skirts are ok"
3.0,"The material is a little thin and the “pocket” isn’t really worth mentioning. I haven’t had issues with them being see through, but these are definitely not my favorite leggings"
3.0,SOA for life!!
3.0,My favorite pair of pants. The new version is super long. I’m 5’4 133lbs. Ordered the small. Very long.. had to return
3.0,Thought this was an adult watch but very small.
3.0,It’s a cute pajama set but a little tight material and material itchy
3.0,unapproved by costumed director because of thin sole
3.0,It's a great sweater to have at the office. The sleeves are long. I ordered a size up and it was a good fit.
3.0,No complaints on how the rings look they're really cute BUT one was missing :(. Kinda upset but can't really do much about it.
3.0,"Wow, the cups were gaping open when I wore it and I was really quite disappointed.  I didn't find it that comfortable to wear, either."
3.0,"The item is beautiful, but I gave it 3 stars because the clasp doesn't stay so it falls off a lot so I do t really wear it I fear I may loose it!"
3.0,Nice pants... run small.
3.0,"It shredded a bit. It looked cute,but I had to get rid of it."
3.0,Wanted to like this but the design was not exactly as it looked on the photos so I returned it. The size was good though.
3.0,cheap pair of sunglasses but that's why I brought them to wear in the beach and not worry if they get lost!
3.0,"Cute and trendy, but I wear an 8.5 to 9 typically, and the 8.5's were big!"
3.0,"Nice size, but quality is flimsy to say the least!"
3.0,Sundress on vacation
3.0,I got my exact size and while it fit in my arms and it could have been larger. I was able to wear it but you definitely want a size larger.
3.0,The product feels good and fits well.  It also works my smart phone most of the time.  The problem is the zipper broke on my left hand glove after about two weeks of average use.  The zipper pull finally cam all of the way off today.  The gloves also are average in warmth and keeping my fingertips warm.  They are worth the price but know they may not hold up to every day vigorous use.
3.0,It is not as long as what I was wanting.
3.0,it fits perfectly it’s just not that cute
3.0,It was much lighter and smaller than I thought. I am ok with the size but wanted it heavier. You cannot even read Air Force on it without a magnifying glass.
3.0,"It was OK, but a little too snug on top, and I am small-chested.  Also, the color is not as rich and vibrant as it looked online.  I returned it."
3.0,They have a strange smell.
3.0,"It's got some chinese text on it, and it seems to work more like a large zip-loc bag."
3.0,Although dress looked nice...the material used looks a bit cheap...but it's cute.
3.0,"Looks nice but cheaply made,an necklace needs longer chain"
3.0,You need one size up
3.0,"What happened with my free gift, everything came but not he gift."
3.0,"i got the yellow mushroom tank top, the material is really weird and cheap and a bit stretchy. it almost feels like the kind of fabric used in costumes. the color is also really off, it's more saturated than i expected. i thought it was going to be a pastel yellow, but it's not. the mushroom is embroidered too low, it looks weird."
3.0,"This is surprisingly comfortable and light. Even though I have a short neck this doesn't get in the way. My only complaint, the paint chips."
3.0,I love this bag and is the perfect for what I am using it for. BUT it does have a very strong &#34;barn/tack room&#34; smell. I have had this bag for several weeks and it still smells. Although the smell is finally starting to fade. I&#34;m keeping the bag because I grew up around horses so I am use to the smell BUT if you aren't then you will not like this product due to the smell.
3.0,"Love the way it looked, but the bit that goes through your nose was rough for some reason so after a couple hours of wear my nose hole started hurting :("
3.0,Shrank immensely. But very comfy.
3.0,This watch band is super cute but very hard to put on your watch. And difficult to take off and put on. I find my self not using it because it’s too difficult. But it is very cute if u have a partner to help you put it on and take it off would be better because I don’t see how any one could take it off by them selfs. Also doesn’t slide to well on the watch gets stuck.
3.0,Not comfortable for a D size cup
3.0,"I don't believe I have a very large nose or an oversized septum but either I do or half these rings are very small. The ones that fit without a lot of pain look great! Unfortunately, that's only about half the pack."
3.0,"So cute, but the sole is separating at the toe after 3 weeks of daily wear."
3.0,I got a Large and am 5’10 and about 195 pounds and they are quite snug.
3.0,Too stiff and bulky...doesn't sit over the ears comfortably and too stiff on the neck !!!
3.0,Had a pair that was purchased 5 - 8 years earlier and wore the soles completely off. I order 1/2 size larger but should have gone a full size for comfort
3.0,Cute. Heavier than I expected. Have gotten several compliments on them.
3.0,"ITS JUST OK, NOT AS CUTE AS THE PICTURE"
3.0,Sizing not as described took one size up and still too small arms cut too deep if taking one size up.
3.0,I thought it was iron free but it wasn’t. The fit is good though
3.0,"Thankfully the ear loops were adjustable and it has a nose wire, but not my favorite mask unfortunately. This mask was too big for me, and I have a big head!"
3.0,"I still like the shirt it's really cute but its more of a belly shirt. It's not long like it shows in the picture. But besides that, u can wear some high top shorts or jeans and it still looks cute. I prefer a longer shirt though."
3.0,I just wish the tassels wouldn’t fall off after one wear.
3.0,"The design is cute, but the fabric is thin and not high quality."
3.0,Cute but very small. It just barely fits my waist and I am a size 8.
3.0,"It had holes in it. They were at the seam, so i can fix easily...but not ideal quality."
3.0,"I had to keep it because I have to pay to return it<br />I haven’t use it and I will not, is too big.<br />Beautiful though"
3.0,"I bought this looking for something different. It is really cute and same in person. For the price it's not that bad. It is a little big, but that is just on me. I am not to happy with the backing on it but like I said for the price is cute and worth it."
3.0,"I returned the product because it was way too big. The blouse was ok, but I didn't think it flattered my figure.  It made me look fat. Sleeves were a little weird"
3.0,"Cute, but not much support if you have a big boobs. I am US size small, I ordered medium, and got XL in Chinese sizing. It was really big on me. I like this swimsuits and I might order smallest size they have."
3.0,This was such a cute top but definitely not a dress. The sleeves were also a bit tight.
3.0,"I really like the quality of these glasses.  They are comfortable and not too tight.  However, because I have a smaller, oval face (female), they look huge on me.  I was told that I look like I have bug eyes.  While I know some women do wear huge glasses, on me, these just don't look very good.  If you have a rounder face, they will look really cool on you as I had a couple people try them on as they have a rounder face.<br /><br />I did received these at a discounted price for my honest review.  Even if you pay full price, they would be worth it as long as you have the right size face or don't mind having sunglasses that are too big on your face."
3.0,"Having put all ten volumes individually in my cart I've found that this pack saves you a whopping $0.14. This is just for the information of those looking to buy, I see a lot of reviews claiming it's a great deal, but I guarantee I could buy all individually for substantially less if I looked for deals.<br />HOWEVER, this manga and the anime are both incredible. Buy this if you want, I just wanted everyone to know the price really isn't saving you anything."
3.0,"Color was off a bit. Padding where? If you're a small cup like me, order a size smaller. Bottoms were tight, not too tight. If you like a little cheeky, order as directed. I'll have work on this top but I'll still wear it"
3.0,"Really like the dress, but it is a little bottom heavy which makes the top half fit awkward."
3.0,"Runs small, but nice material"
3.0,"Shoes are so cute and seemingly decent quality. Sizing way off. I got a 10, my normal size, and I couldn’t even get my foot through the straps."
3.0,Run small. Not made for people with a wide or long face. Not what I expected.
3.0,"These pretty camisoles don't have much give.  The are actually tight on me and should have been the right size.  The length is very good, longer than average, but the overall fit is tight.  I was disappointed about that.  Up side?  They kind of act like a body shaper..."
3.0,Really really long
3.0,Snags on everything
3.0,First off be aware of the shipping time. It took a lot time for mine to arrive it looks like it is available via prime now so that might not be a problem anymore. I mean technically the time it took to ship was not a problem for me but I just wanted to warn anyone that might want this item for a specific occasion and whatnot. I read other reviews that said this item ran small for them but it runs large for me around the underarm area. I am Asian and all these other reviews talks about it being Asian sized and whatnot but that wasn't true for me. I normally wear between a S or M depending on the article of clothing so I ordered a S for this dress and it ended up being quite loose around the under arm area and it does hang low under the armpits as well. I feel like if I don't wear the right bra for this I will be showing a lot of side boob. I think in order for me to wear this I would need to wear a wrap around bra one of those bandeau bras. Which isn't a super big deal to me because I have one but just FYI. The other thing is I think their coloring names is wrong because as you can see the picture of the &#34;red&#34; dress is more like an orange. I thought maybe that was just a photo issue but it really comes as a neon orange color. But overall it's an okay dress. For the price I'm not going to be super picky about it. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
3.0,I like the suit but it runs small.
3.0,"Nice hat but they fool you. It is wool bit YET also polyester. Beware if you are allergic, like most humans, to POLYESTER FROM CHINA."
3.0,meaures smaller than normal
3.0,Cute but turning my girl's finger green.
3.0,The product arrive in an open package and it was smaller than I expected. Gave to my niece.
3.0,I wanted these to match the Shambala-inspired pendant (add-on) item.  They don't.  The earring dangles are larger by 2-3 mm in diameter and not very bright.  The crystals are much smaller.  I may send them back.
3.0,"The mask is very nice, but the size is very small"
3.0,The clasp comes undone easily.
3.0,"They are so tiny! I expected them to be small,  but not that small! Other than that,  they are fine."
3.0,"I am a fourth year college student and it fits my necessities pretty good, but the straps sit high on my shoulders withe adjoining buckle in my face. If the fit of the shoulder straps could be adjusted a bit better, it'd probably make for a good backpack. I might also add that there are considerably large keyring holes making this less than desirable as a waterproof backpack."
3.0,"Not what I thought, was looking for a sweatsuit . Very cute though."
3.0,Interesting novelty item which works...<br />I wouldof rated thia higher but the beanie itself is itchy and uncomfortable.
3.0,"Made cheaper and smaller, even with 1 size bigger..."
3.0,"I have to echo some of the comments on this product (under different listings).  The good:  I'm a size large in dresses, I ordered a large, it fit as expected.  For this cheap of a dress, I was expecting a bit thinnner/cheaper fabric - don't get me wrong, this isn't super amazing, thick fabric, but it wasn't too thin, decent for the price.  With that said, the not so great:  the halter is too long - something that can be fixed, but frankly way too long.  Additionally, the halter straps start under the armpit, more so if you have a small chest- you can sort of see it in the picture, but it's a very weird placement that makes the dress fit oddly.  Overall, it's not a horrible dress, and heck, it was $15."
3.0,Did not look as cute as in photo. Just okay looking but price was low so not too bummed.
3.0,"comfy, casual top"
3.0,The bra was beautiful but unfortunately it was too small and did not fit
3.0,The inside zipper gets hung up or doesn't zip at all. Unfortunately I didn't use this until it was too late to return. But for casual use it looks good and is lightweight.
3.0,Thinner than excepted.
3.0,"Band is long and didn't have enough holes to keep it on my wrist, I had to make another one"
3.0,the bands have a tendency to off
3.0,"I got a us size 12/L. Im 5'6 , this was short enough in the torso I had crazy camel toe and could not lift my arms. I'm a 36C this was not meant to contain a 36C I was squished down to a B cup as if I were wearing a sports bra instead of a jump suit. If you are a shorter lady with a smaller chest this would be a lovely outfit. The material was thin but not see though and is definitely suited for warmer weather."
3.0,"Nice shirt, but I had to return it because the size ran a little too small. Tried buying it again in another size but it looks like it's no longer for sale. Oh well."
3.0,"I gave it a 3 because it is cute, but not amazing. You receive the dress on the mannequin, but not the one on the model.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* I was worried this would be Asian sizing, so I got an XX-Large. It is much too big for me. I am 5'5"" and usually wear a M/L. I am trying to decide whether to exchange for a L or XL. So I'd recommend going up a size or so, but don't overdo it, like I did.<br /><br />* It is also important to note that the dress on the model is different in two ways than the dress in the mannequin pictures, which is the one you will receive. 1) The collar the model has is rolled, creating a more rounded, heavier neckline; the dress on the mannequin, which you will receive, is a basic neckline; 2) the material used on the model's dress is stiff (either lined or uses a more hefty fabric) so the ruffles have structure and stay flounced out; the dress on the mannequin, which you will receive, lays more flat.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Having said that, the pleating of the material and the triple layers of fabric give it some flounce.<br /><br />* And because the price is good, I might even take the chance of adding some fusible stabilizer to the back of the material layers to give them that stiffness.<br /><br />* I ordered the red and the color is nice and totally opaque. The material is good quality, it is relatively thick and has a good stretch to it (another reason I will exchange for a smaller size).<br /><br />* The style is cute and I still like the mid-century vibe.<br /><br /> *It arrived sooner than the estimated 21-33 days. I received it in about 17 calendar days WITHOUT paying for upgraded shipping."
3.0,"I love the way these gloves fit and they are great for sparring. The ONLY issue I had is that the paint or whatever used to color them started flaking off after only one use. There appears to be wear after only a week or so around the stitching and I'm only using them for a few rounds every couple of days. For the price, they aren't bad, I've just never seen wear happen so quickly on gloves in over a decade of hard training."
3.0,Took months to get here. Fits a bit small. My son loves it. I think it’s just ok.
3.0,You get what you pay for that’s all I can say
3.0,I saw the other reviews for this products and was on the fence how I felt about it. The photos don’t show it too well but the top that comes with the skirt is NOT IT. Very cheaply made and it took me back to high school theater. BUT the skirt is adorable. The fabric is comfortable and a little on the smaller size. I went up a size but would recommend going up two sizes if you can.
3.0,"Shirt was cute, but the cut is so strange.  I am 5'4"" and th bottom hem came mid thigh.  Too bad was cute."
3.0,"Cute, but came bent. I was able to fix them myself."
3.0,Did not have pockets as described
3.0,Beautiful but quality not the greatest<br />Hope it doesn’t fall apart
3.0,"Be aware when you buy this sweater there are a few things you the buyer should know.  The color is a lot brighter than the seller advertises.  The fit is larger than I expected and the fit is also kind of frumpy looking.  It is comfortable, but the material is very thin and see through.  You must wear a shirt under this.  It will not keep you warm unless you layer with it.  I wear a long sleeve shirt underneath because the sleeves of this sweater do make my arms itchy.  It is absolutely just for casual wear.<br />I think after a few wears and washes this might stretch out even more or possibly lose its shape, so be careful when you launder it.  There is no loose stitching, but again, it may not be durable enough to last after a few wears.  I don't think it is really worth the price you pay."
3.0,"returned it, wasn't what I expected"
3.0,the stones easily fell off. Wont last long because eventually alll small fake diamonds will be gone.
3.0,If this weren't a very stretchy poly/spandex blend then I wouldnt have been able to fit into it. As is the shorts are a little tight but wearable the top...forget it. These sizings are definitely the chinese version of small/medium/large
3.0,It has made the leather softer but not stretched it kind I had hoped
3.0,I like the gown so I am going to keep it. But it is too tight through the hips for it to be a true woman's size.
3.0,Good product but I could not use because they are too big to use for masks.
3.0,I ordered a youth small for my grandson.  They sent a youth large in a bag marked youth small.  It was to way to big for my grandson.  The shirt is like it was described.  I hope he still likes Beckham when he can fit into the shirt.
3.0,"Sent me the wrong color wanted dark gray, looks funny on my and doesn't stay on at night"
3.0,"Cute throw on piece or house dress. Definitely not off the shoulder unless you go size up, but then does nothing for you figure unless belted. The fabric is awesome though and arrived ontime!"
3.0,"Ordered for a wedding with “cocktail formal attire” looks great in photos, but in person this dress has issues! The neckline looks hurriedly cut, kind of unfinished with the lace edges being raw. The straps and elastic in the back , as well as the slip part of the dress looks super cheap. Overall worth 30 bucks, but don’t expect it to look expensive! I didn’t have to high of hopes since it was just $30, so overall I’m not too disappointed in the “moneys worth” department. Just not sure if it’ll work for what I bought it for. It does look cute in pictures though, so maybe. I ordered a ten dollar dress off amazon as well and we will see how the quality compares. It’s kindof like ordering from wish, does it look like the photos? Kinda. But it’s kinda cheap looking in pictures. We’ll see if I can fancy it up a little for the wedding. Also mine feels a little big, it’s comfortable though."
3.0,"Good looking jacket, beautiful leather. Unfortunately medium size 10 was too small and the sleeves too short. I’m a small size 6, so I ordered medium jacket to have room for a sweater, but it was too small even with a T-shirt underneath!"
3.0,"I LOVED IT, BUT MY WIFE SAYS NOT SO MUCH.  GOOD SHIPPING AND PACKAGING."
3.0,I would say size up at least one
3.0,"Pros: Price and water resistance (good to at least 90 feet down). Oh yeah, the price.<br />Cons: Strap eventually breaks and the light is very dim (light is essentially worthless)"
3.0,"They're cute, but seem to be made too well. Had them a day, haven't worn them and a button already fell off."
3.0,small but nice
3.0,"I love the color choices of the dress and the flare at the bottom is a nice touch.  The fabric seems a bit thin to me.  I typically wear a L but ordered an XL to be safe and the XL was snug.  I would say the sizes run smaller so definitely order a size up.  Overall, it's a cute lightweight dress."
3.0,"Loved it, until the main section lining tore within 6 months.... good organizer, zippers work really well, outer purse still looks great. I use purses much longer than 6 months....  so am afraid to replace this one."
3.0,Nice quality & I can tell they would work good on disposable masks but won't stay on my fabric masks.
3.0,This is a nice-looking belt.  The only problem is that the rhinestone part is not attached permanently on one end.  It is difficult to slip both parts of the metal hooks together.
3.0,"While these may be great for very slim people- I do not recommend for anyone with a butt or curves...  They are somewhat sheer/see through and don't come up high enough for my preference.  I much prefer the 90 Degrees brand to these, for much the same price; I think the quality and fit is better."
3.0,"Me quedo grande, no me gusto."
3.0,"Beautiful, just cut small. Does not match size chart. Size up."
3.0,color more washed out than photos show
3.0,"Nice glasses, but cheaply made.  Good thing they didn't cost much...."
3.0,But love it still . Also vary Low!
3.0,the fabric feels cheap
3.0,I am pregnant but petite I always fit  medium in china style dresses and I’m 5’3  so I went with a large and I’d say it is two sizes too small ... definitely size up one or two ! It is a beautiful dress and cute design the butt area is see through too so you have to size up and maybe put a slip . The color is a pretty dusty pink / mauve.quality is okay not the best but not the cheapest. I have to return due to size so if you’re 8/10  and not pregnant definitely a large !
3.0,They are cute but heavy and not as breathable as I had hoped
3.0,The ankle straps cut into my ankles. They were too high. I returned them.
3.0,"I wear a size 8.5 womens. These are fairly loose on me and don't stay in place very well. They also squeak on my hard floors which is kind of annoying. They are soft and comfortable, but I wish they came in multiple sizes."
3.0,"The color was faded not a true black and the material was not as expected, cheap material"
3.0,Rink was OK but appeared to have sharp edges on the blue spinner section.  Seems like $23 postage for a package costing probably an actual postal charge of $1.25 seemed out of sight.
3.0,"Purchased for a gift so I can not speak to the quality.  I received the necklace quickly, cam in a nice box.  Necklace is pretty but the peral is pretty small."
3.0,"If your looking for a fitted polo, this is not it. Its a very boxy fit shirt. The quality of the fabric is good. A thicker cotton blend. Mostly cotton. This is not a Junior fit. I'm a Women's M and it fit like a larger Womens M. I had to take in the sides about 3 inch total and its slightly fitted. A little more feminine look to it."
3.0,I loved the dress I just ordered the wrong size
3.0,It’s always hard to find things for plus size girls but I made it work. Decent quality.
3.0,"There were rips in the toes area and threads hanging everywhere. If it wasn't such a hassle and if my 5 year old would let me return it, I would have. Instead, I had to finish sewing it  and cut off all the hanging threads"
3.0,Fits as expected but your whole butt will be exposed. I bought in grey and black. The grey has a white liner that rolls and exposes the white liner. The black however is all black and the liner is the same color and material as the rest of the suit so even if it rolls a little you cant tell. If you buy thks probably get the black. I dont remember the size but it fit well besides the issue with the liner rolling.
3.0,"Ultimately, I returned the product."
3.0,Pretty color. Soft material. Good knjtting in pretty pattern. Hat too small. Feels like made for child head. I have average head size also. Dissappoonted cuz it took forever to get here. Deciding if it will stretch over time kr just gonna send to a child.
3.0,Runs Very Large. An XS fits like a normal medium loose fitted shirt. Overall quality good.
3.0,"I love the way it looks, but it keeps breaking on me.... so not sure how to rate it.... probably don't waste your time"
3.0,This kaftan is lovey fits great & my husband really likes it on me. It’s easy to wear because it’s cotton and doesn’t hurt my skin like some materials do. I will say there where small holes all around the neck line but I needed to wear it to an event so I wore a statement necklace and a scarf and will fix later. So just keep an eye out for that.
3.0,"Very nice hat, I wish the x large size could be a little bit bigger."
3.0,Too small but my correct size.
3.0,"I wanted to love this top, but the fabric is so think that it bulks at the seams. It's almost like a bathing suit material, but heavy."
3.0,Retro look....needed for a fifties cruise.
3.0,"This neck gaiter is rough, it does not feel like marine Wool. I will go with a name-brand marine wool gaiter next time."
3.0,"I'm an average sized woman with an average sized head, but the hat is very snug. I think it would fit children better."
3.0,"The ones (2 pairs) that are good are beautiful but, unfortunately many came with black spots in rose gold coating and look aweful .... would have been 5 stars if not for that. They are not dainty in size I would say 1/4 and 3/8 inch length.<br />Customer sevice was excellent though so I have split my rating in the middle."
3.0,This top is beautiful and well-made. The fit is amazing and accentuates all the right areas. The only drawback is that it really wrinkles a lot. Like A LOT. So unfortunately I don't wear this shirt as much because I have to make a conscious effort to wash it and immediately hang it dry. Even then it still looks wrinkled.
3.0,fabric was fine<br />construction was satisfactory<br />color seemed a bit more blue than black
3.0,these are super big
3.0,Listing says 3xl tag on suit says xl. I ordered another one thinking it was an error. But sameness thing.
3.0,"I love these boots, but because the only sizes they had left were not US sizes and no one seemed to be able  to help with what sizes transferred to US sizes, they are too small."
3.0,Good size bag.  I like the color.  It had a fishy smell when I got it don't know what that was about.  In about three weeks or so it subsided or I got use to smelling it - not sure which.
3.0,"Band size a bit small. Great other than that. Cups fit nice, just the right amount of padding and NO push up!"
3.0,Me funciono para lo que necesitaba pero no son de muy buena calidad
3.0,"This worked to wear once, I wore it for a wedding while nursing my 2 month old. But the skirt fabric is very thin and didn't survive a wash."
3.0,"Comfortable but not durable, bought direct w/RX and love them for biking.  Problem I had is lenses are removable and tab that locks them in place broke. Ordered new lens holders and replaced lens (use hot water).  But new lens holder tabs broke again after short time.  Not sure why they break because I don’t change lenses ever?  Super glued now.....yeah $500 ish w/ RX and I’ve super glued them and seem to be holding up.  Hope to get a few more years out of them.  These are large so be aware if you have narrow face they will look funky.  Perfect under bike helmet fit."
3.0,The strap for the glasses was not included...very disappointed
3.0,Nice pin. Seemed a little small. Thought it would be a little larger.  Great for a lapel or tie. I do like the  pin.
3.0,"Tight in the bust, loose everywhere else."
3.0,I wear a size 14 in pants. I read the reviews about them running small so I ordered the largest size they have. One word...TIGHT! To me they are made for someone with a little waist.
3.0,It's small but very cute. Wish I had ordered larger size
3.0,I gave this a 3 star review because I ordered 2 of these dresses. One came with a small stain that wasn't super noticeable and I was still able to wear it for maternity photos. The one I chose not to wear I sent back and am still waiting on a refund. In a week it looks like I'm no closer to receiving a refund as I was the day I shipped it. If refunded I plan to change my review.<br />For those looking for size reference... I ordered xl
3.0,The hat is very square...kind of looks like a Charlie Brown hat.  No amount of bending the brim or adjusting the size seems to make a difference. Great graphics - just fits oddly
3.0,Not high impact support. Works well for yoga!
3.0,The insoles don't retain their cushioning effect.
3.0,Sizing is Way Off. Ordered one size larger than usually wear and dress was still too small. Wife says the material was much thinner than expected.
3.0,The band is just ok.  The band is hard to attach to the watch and you have to tighten thru out the day.
3.0,dislike. belt is too hard to adjust. suspect how long the lifetime it will be
3.0,"They’re cool. Like the one clasp and two bands. Bit thin but, ok. I wear with others so the size adds variety and texture. Good price. I rate three because they are not hundred plus $ items. Good for the price so maybe even a four."
3.0,If you are tall like myself dress is very very short and revealing
3.0,"Really liked the top.  Everyone warned that the top was cut straight which meant it would be tight for anyone with hips to wear.  They were ALL CORRECT.  Get a size up from what you think, unless you are as thin as the model in the picture.  Definitely not a lot of cotton but seems like a rayon blend which is nice.  Had to send it back."
3.0,"Item was as described, the only bad thing that I found was that the big stone fell off and in order to use it I will have to glue it back on the necklace. I guess that's what I get for the price"
3.0,[[VIDEOID:20db9b9cc6885d12badfc4f414a83c3d]] Me agradaron mucho en esepcion de que llegaron con defectos un adornito caido y doblados de la parte de atras y un lado eso no me gusto pero son hermosos
3.0,"I seriously think this may be a copy. Looks the same as my other ones, but the material etc is Not the same."
3.0,"I almost always wear a size 8, but one of these boots fit well while the other one was tight. They were also extremely uncomfortable to walk in for more than a few minutes at a time."
3.0,"The hat quality is fine but the ""Custom Graphic"" is just a home made iron on printed on an inkjet printer. I can do that myself. Would not order again."
3.0,"I figured I'd be between sizes so went up, and they're probably a little big. You may or may not get the colors they promise (I didn't get one in nude.). I find the padding awkward, but it's easy to remove. If you're a little bigger, you'll probably find the support to be minimal - wear them around, I suppose you could wear them for yoga, but not for anything with impact. I've gotten similar products that I've liked better."
3.0,Fits small so buy up a couple sizes
3.0,Too long for my face and corners remind me of poodle skirt attire
3.0,"Ist the pinky ring fits nothing not even a #2 pincel.so its useless ... They look great and shipped quickly ..thum, indext, middle fingers fit ok the fore finger is to big . I have small hands male ...they are heavy but full of stone's.I will try and glue them in place on gloves as to keep them on and not lose them .the pinky I will cut it and try to force it open enough to fit ... Good luck"
3.0,"wrist , broke easy"
3.0,"I really like the watch. The only thing that I don't like is the band material.<br /><br />The rubber silicone just doesn't feel right to me.<br /><br />Others might not find uncomfortable.<br /><br />Just not the right band for me.<br /><br />Box says Made in Switzerland, nice."
3.0,"Frames are nice and light.<br />I returned the first pair because they were really crooked. One side fit nice and tight to the side of my face, the other side stuck out too far and looked funny.<br />The second pair was not as noticeable but a little crooked. I figured out that I was able to bend and ply the frames to fit my face better.  Not sure if the issue is with quality control or the way that they're packaged.<br />I kept the second pair as a backup pair on my boat, but wouldn't recommend them."
3.0,Lovely top but ill fitting..  tried both medium and small..  Would have to be adjusted as they were both big and had lots of stretch.
3.0,"I’m not a fan of wearing a mask, it’s awkward but hopefully it’ll be good for air travel."
3.0,"I'm 155lbs and 5'2"", size 10/12, and the large was too big. The cut seems nice, but it just is too large. Because the cut is too big, it rides up the chest and looks frumpy. I am going to order another one in medium, and I suspect it will fit quite well and stay in place."
3.0,Smaller than is standard for my size
3.0,Kinda flimsey
3.0,Material is well made but too small for a medium
3.0,I can fit but i guess my wrist is much larger than the model.
3.0,Stone is very dark hard to tell iy is a purpke cokor
3.0,Very wide and short. Weeeeird build. For like a real big football player lol
3.0,"The quality is good, however it's made out of a very heavy fleece. It will keep you warm in a blizzard.  I thought that I was ordering the correct size, but it is at least two sizes too big for me."
3.0,"Very cute. I liked the shirt, it was a little small but wearable. I washed / dried it once and now it’s unwearable :( I wish I sized up another size. I went up one size in case it shrunk but should have went up two. Bummed because it’s cute and good price."
3.0,"It's alright, magnet hold just OK"
3.0,Does the job but definitely size up
3.0,It was pretty but did not fit like it should have as was advertised.
3.0,"It looks good and seems to be warm enough. but it stretches out and looses shape very easily and the stitching came undone at the part where the grey felt meets the black knitted part. I like the way it looks and it was cheap so I used the gap where the stitching came apart to flip it inside out and run it through the sewing machine to reinforce all the poor stitching to make sure it doesn’t come apart again. Coincidentally, my brother bought the same exact item and his was also very stretched out. I suppose it is worth paying less if you have the time, skills, and equipment to essentially finish the job of making it. Otherwise, it’s a 1-2 times use item."
3.0,Not pure sterling silver they are 9bly plated and wares off after about 2 weeks of wear.
3.0,"Unfortunately the sizing is way off on the socks.  They initially came in the mail - small and then when they were washed once, they became even smaller.  My daughter won't be able to wear them for long which is sad.  Especially for the price.  Size up!  Wish I had...."
3.0,"If you are expecting modesty, you will be disappointed. This sleep gown is very thin and leaves nothing to the imagination. But I will say for being very thin, it is very comfy and it doesn’t make you hot while sleeping and I like the pockets. I just wouldn’t suggest walking around the house in it in front of the kids!"
3.0,The mask string detached from the mask itself as I was putting it on for the first time. Recommend making it more secure before wearing it out
3.0,Very cute but it’s cut for someone with HUGE tits n a tiny waist. I’m trying to decide if I should pay to have the bra altered to fit or just return the set...
3.0,It was very nice except the sizes are a lot smaller than what they say they are but otherwise I liked it.
3.0,"This product was just ok for me, it had a couple different settings which was good but they didn't light up as bright as I hoped for other than that they were fine"
3.0,I broke after 24 hours. I thought it was the battery but I wasn't.  Beautiful product but not very strong.
3.0,"It's really cute it's just to small. I usually wear a medium or large and I ordered It anyway. It's one size fits all but models measurements were close to mine so I thought I'd try's it's just a little to small, I don't like stuff fitted so if you don't mind that then you'll be fine :)"
3.0,This bag would be perfectly comparable to a pre-schoolers bookbag. For adults a small purse/bag.
3.0,Didn't expect much from it but it OK great fit a bit thin that can be remedy
3.0,"The material is quite stiff and uncomfortable. The pattern is clear though, the size is right, and the construction of it is decent."
3.0,"These serve the purpose. They are a tiny bit flimsy, and definitely skinny. Getting it over your head is a mildly tight squeeze. But it serves the purpose."
3.0,Runs at least 1 size larger..
3.0,These are just below what I would consider novelty quality. The character has an iron on look which does not make me think it will hold up well in the wash.
3.0,So cute. Wish I could keep but the fitted part that goes where a bra band should just does not fit. Would be gorgeous otherwise. I ordered a medium and I'm a 34D for reference.
3.0,Not what I was expecting.  This is really just a long tank.  I picked the black and the picture of the print I picked had flowers scttered.  This has way way more.
3.0,"Totally see-through! I purchased some in other colors previously, so wasn't expecting these to be completely sheer. They are as comfy as the others though; just don't expect to wear them around the kids! :)"
3.0,The sizes are off it runs large
3.0,Tarnished very easily. I loved it until it Tarnished.
3.0,Cute but run small. Xl is a US women size 10
3.0,"The only issues I have are: it is too big, I know it's supossed to be oversized and have flow, but it's huge on me. I'm 5' 9&#34; and 160. Second issue: where the embroidery is there is a scratchy feel all along the inside. I'm hoping this goes away after I wash it. :) it also had a funny smell, but I think that will also be remedied with a good wash.<br /><br />The material and style are cute and I think it will make a good beach/pool cover regardless of size."
3.0,Ugh my 2 year old hates them. It takes longer than he's willing to sit to put these on his little fingers. Good thought though.
3.0,"It fits very well, but the finish on this is not good.  Nose area is crooked. The styling is based on your taste.  I think it looks good.  I have the coffee golden tea color.  The lens makes everything brown.  So i could not wear this as it bothers me."
3.0,But it has a tendency to either ride up your legs or (if you have dry skin) does a static cling to the back of your legs. The color is lovely. The fabric not so much. I ended up returning it
3.0,runs small. i gave them to goodwill.
3.0,"Love the case for my clumsy butt, however the signal loss from the fob to the Jeep is pretty significant. I have to be right on the jeep to unlock, auto start is pointless now and even when in the car it wont always detect the fob."
3.0,"My extra long Manduka Pro mat does fit in this. The bag is very thin and lightweight, a single layer of cotton fabric, but it works."
3.0,Very nice necklace however I would have liked it to be a thicker metal. You get what you pay for.
3.0,"Not a great material but fine, doesn't look like leather but the skirt is made of a shiny fabric,<br />I'm usually size 8 and buyed a XL but it's a bit big and the fabric wrinkles, I think an L would look better."
3.0,Run small and the zipper broke easily. But they are cute pants I would order a size up
3.0,I would say it's pretty good the wheels I got don't roll as smoothly as some other reviews might say but it does feel better than before to move it back and forth. It only rolls back and forth so If you'd like it to roll all directions I say get the 360 wheels.
3.0,"When I first began purchasing these necklaces to give to students in one of our school programs, the pendants were longer and the saying was written in larger letters. The dimensions were the same other than the length. Now the pendants are only two-thirds the length of the original pendants. The printing is much smaller and more difficult to read. These are less impressive then the original necklaces and I am searching for some other product to give to the girls. It is very disappointing because the original necklaces received such positive comments, but now they are simply okay."
3.0,"6XL fit more like a (US) 4XL. Nice thick fabric, very bright color. True to picture. Easy and fast return. Too bad it didn't fit :("
3.0,"It took over a month to arrive and seems to be the same dress I bought twice from wish. Had it been delivered sooner I would have been much happier. I send items over seas all the time to China and other countries and it takes tops two weeks at the longest to arrive, so I’m wondering why it took so long. I do like the dress though."
3.0,Bracket itself is beautiful.<br />I did get the one I ordered. This is def not something I want to give as a gift to my preceptor. Now I am scrambling for a new gift.
3.0,Rough seams and tight fit make these feel like your wearing cardboard. Uncomfortable.
3.0,"They seem well-constructed and wash well, but out of all the masks I own these make it more difficult to breathe than any others have."
3.0,"will stain suede colors, but it does help in the stretch"
3.0,It works well but I expected more.<br />The app works and so does the mask but the LEDs are large so it ends up being clunky.
3.0,No era la tela esperada
3.0,Very  nice  fit
3.0,My husband and I thought these would look really great on him and although they do look great on him they are see-through and it is very cheap thin material.
3.0,The neckline is very low.
3.0,Somewhat CHEAPLY MADE
3.0,For the value you get all the pieces you need includding the tikka...the quality is low budget and some beads come loose but its not hard to fix if you have super glue on hand. Very heavy also. But overall a good value.
3.0,Great item but came broken
3.0,"Nice looking watch.  It has to be by light constantly to keep it charged. When not wearing the watch, keep it in an area with light."
3.0,So cute but hard to keep the purse upright! It always flipped upside down. I used it for a Halloween party at my parents house and I ended up just holding it for the pictures.
3.0,This product is definitely better quality then I expected. Only problem I have is that the cup part is see through lace?!
3.0,"It doesn't look a ton like the product description but it's in the general area. I haven't noticed it glowing, but it was a gift for my daughter who seems satisfied with it."
3.0,"This is cute, but the curved post is too short for my piercing, so the elegant part is tucked away and pointing downwards. It's not that I'm a big girl either, I am 5'6&#34; 140 lbs"
3.0,"I love the pockets, the material is a little thin but would be good for really hot weather"
3.0,90% of them were too small.
3.0,"They are very comfortable BUT they do roll down when walking on a treadmill. For that reason I won't be reordering. I'm not a super skinny person, but do have others that dont roll. Over all they are good for home, but not for fitness purposes for me."
3.0,"These pj pants are not bad for the price. They are super soft and warm. However, they seemed to fit a little tight in the butt. I think they are more junior sized than women's. I also had a problem with a hole forming in the crotch of both pairs after the first washing. That wasn't a huge deal for me as I just stitched them shut again but it really shouldn't happen."
3.0,"Love the cotton, but don't like the inside toe seam! It's way too prominent. I have to wear the socks inside out because the toe seam is uncomfortable."
3.0,Very cheap looking the bottom is see through
3.0,it looks beautiful but it's a big pain in the ear
3.0,Really small. I order the xl and they fit like a large. I love the material of them. But definitely size up.
3.0,Material shrunk when washed. Cut is nice though. Runs a little small. Quality in line with price.
3.0,It is a great fit. But the plastic looks cheep. It doesn't look like leather at all. But I will keep it. its only bucks.
3.0,Cute but sticks out from the face about a half an inch.
3.0,"Thin fabric, not the color option I ordered.  Color bled on some in cold wash.  Not impressed."
3.0,Such a cute top but I bought the size suggested and it fits too tightly through the top.
3.0,"I read through the reviews before ordering and a lot of them said to order a size up, so I did. Bad move on my part. My top is too big and I can't get it tied tight enough to hold the girls up. Other than that, I liked it. It's super cute and I love the colors. I didn't like the pattern being on the bottoms so I didn't wear the bottoms. I paired the top with black miracle suit bottoms and I think it looked way better since it has the black on the top of the bra. My measurements are 45&#34; chest, 41&#34; waist, and 44&#34; hips. I recommend sticking to the size you wear and not going up a size. Apparently, some ladies are trying to lie to themselves about what size they really are!"
3.0,I was skeptical because this had no reviews.  It’s a lot cuter than I thought it’d be.  But there’s a couple issues.  It came with a snag right on the chest so not discreet.  It’s also not shaped like the pictures.  If it was tailored more like the pics it’d be great.  But it’s not.
3.0,I like the glasses but not the fit. I can't get the nose piece right. They sit on my cheeks.
3.0,The underwear fits perfectly but it's too high waisted for my liking. Need to be little more thinner not to have a muffin top when wearing this one.
3.0,The sizing in this is a bit off.
3.0,it is too heavy.... it gives accurate time so far
3.0,Built Solid. I bought these after a “as seen on tv” pair that I lost<br />I wish the yellow was darker... I think doing so the vehicle lights would be dimmer.<br /><br />If they were darker... 5 stars
3.0,Had to take the sides in for my flat belly
3.0,"These have an odd fit to them. Short legs, weird stretched out neckline on the top. The material is wonderful. Soft minky and didn't pill. I was set to order more but after washing the elastic in both pairs I ordered got so twisted up inside I couldn't fix it. The waistband elastic was so wide and thick it wouldn't budge. I ended up having to cut the elastic out completely,  which I dont like. They oddly have elastic on the bottom of both tops which did the same thing!! So now I have to cut out all elastic in both sets or be extremely annoyed. All they had to do was tack the elastic in place to avoid that problem. Takes a few stitches only. I dont have the time or desire to fix them. I would not buy them again."
3.0,Not sure these are the original Lokai beads..I have one from the Lokai company and there's definitely a difference--but for the price it's a good knockoff.
3.0,It does not fit my glasses.It is way too big
3.0,Fiancé didn't care to much for it. Doesn't like the way the material feels. I didn't think it looked to bad tho
3.0,Very nice top. However I choose a small and it's still too big for me.
3.0,"These are really cute but if you have larger calves, they will not fit! Ended up giving them to my daughter."
3.0,"these belts are really cute, but they easily come unsnapped, and because they are so springy, they aren't easy to control and re-snap without some hefty effort."
3.0,I used to love these and bought a few packs in the past. But the pack I just bought I noticed they changed the design and the socks are bigger and now they stick outta my shoes. So now I gotta walk round lookin like a silly silly joke man whose socks stick out of his loafers. Not a fashionable gent who looks like he’s rockin no socks but is but now the secrets out. ;(
3.0,Paintings are cheap. Latex looks nothing like metalic feel but clearly better than making your own mask if you are not good with making things with your hands.
3.0,"I've tried several brands, and they are all a bit long  and after a day of wearing, they give me rings where they reach under the knee...an inch shorter would be perfect, but they maybe sized for taller people than me...I am 5 ft. 4 in..."
3.0,They look cool but they are very uncomfortable. I wore them to a Prince concert and got lots of admiring glances.
3.0,2.  Out of the 5 pair were smaller. Tag says medium.  Inconsistent sizes in one package.
3.0,"I ordered 3.  Two of the three were amazing:  fit, feel, without the sunrays going through it, so not sunburns.  However, the third had the right arm longer than the left arm; I need to return it and hopefully I would like to get an exchange if possible."
3.0,The quality was decent but it was extremely difficult to read the text so I returned it.
3.0,Gap in the piece is too narrow for my use.
3.0,"I read another buyer's comment that this runs small, so ordered up a size on the first order.  Just had to submit another order for XL.  You need to update your product information to state that this shirt runs extremely small."
3.0,Runs at least 2 sizes to small.
3.0,"I wore it to a cowboy party, it was ok... Nothing special, but it served it's purpose."
3.0,"Nice looking vest, however the sizes run small. I suggest ordering one size larger"
3.0,"I purchased a small. I'm 5'4 and 135lbs. FYI-The pants fit me like a ""track suit"" pant and as pictured. I  think if you have a medium to big butt and sone meat in your thighs-it will probably fit you perfectly! Definitely for someone who has a shape."
3.0,I liked the amethyst and peridot colors of this necklace (since those are mine and my wife's birthstones) and the reasonable price. The actual color of the stones is very pale and washed-out. The chain is so short and thin as to be worthless. I guess you get what you [don't] pay for.
3.0,"I use it for my work watch, nice band holds up to snags and tension. However you can barely see the numbers on the face of the watch, still a good buy"
3.0,"I love the feel of this sweater, and the neckline is beautiful. However, the length is a bit too short for me at 5'8"" and the middle section of the sweater is too big for me. It's more of a boxy fit but isn't loose enough to achieve that look. It's okay and I'll keep the sweater because it's so soft, but I'll plan to take in the sides to make it a regular sweater shape.<br /><br />If you want an oversized shape, I recommend ordering up a size"
3.0,tienen mala vejez. se destiñen al pasar el tiempo.
3.0,It was a bit too thin but I will wear it with a jacket.
3.0,"The color was more of an orange-red rather than the burgundy red shown here.  The lace is stiff which I suppose is necessary to keep it from flopping.  Unfortunately, I didn't like it enough to keep."
3.0,They do not stay up well but they look good- don’t feel like the other stance socks— possibly because they were made prior to more recent stance socks this was remedied in later socks
3.0,I love it it’s cute but won’t stay clasped into my Fitbit
3.0,I was expecting a thicker knit. A little disappointing truthfully. My son will be working in extreme cold. Does not seem adequate.
3.0,"Althought the hat fit well, it was smaller than I expected. However for the price it was good quality"
3.0,top of the dress color doesn't match the bottom very well. cute though
3.0,Not quite as thick as I would have hoped and they do have a bit of a chemical smell to them. Airing them out after washing and hoping it goes away
3.0,"Low quality. It is just pretty only, if u looking for quality then this is not it. Packaging box was also cheap looking so to give a gift to someone with such a cheap looking box and a cheap looking Watch strap. Delivery was on time tho."
3.0,This FIYOTE Women Plus Size Strapped One Piece/Bikini Swimwear Swimsuit design is EVERYTHING! But the fit of the top is ALL WRONG.  Its molded cup design did not work for my plus size boobies (42 DD). The bottoms worked just fine. I had to return this item.
3.0,"I wanted this top when I found it. Sadly it is too small. The bag said XL, but it looled more like a medium. THERE WAS NOT TAG, as if someone took it off. I love the fluttery sleeves. Im so bummed i cant fit into this"
3.0,The shirt is heavy like a flannel shirt.  The arms are long.  The blouse does gap at the bra line when I move so I have to use safety pin.
3.0,I got the pink and it is true to the color shown. I ordered it as it was supposedly 95% cotten but does not feel like it? The dress does not really have a shape but it will work for me as an extra just on case summer dress.
3.0,"The dress is super soft, and it is exactly what it is advertised as. However, something about it, (the color, the way"
3.0,"This is great dress, comfortable, stylish. However…after wash it shrunk and I did not put it in the dryer. Sadly, too short now I’ll pass it onto a friend"
3.0,Way too small and not very stretchy material. I would have to lose 20lbs before these fit and I usually fit into mediums just fine.<br />Im 5ft 4 and 140lbs
3.0,Cute necklace  but they did not ship  the bracelet  I paid for. Disappointing.
3.0,Mask is comfortable but the things on the end which allow you to adjust the size fall off after a while of use.
3.0,"It fit and it served the purpose, but I felt that the padding could have been a liilte thinner.  Overall was ok."
3.0,"I actually was going to pair this with a Halloween costume I had in mind, but it was way too large even after I add a belt to the midsection.  I would definitely say to size down!"
3.0,I would rate this product about three. this product was not made as well as I had expected it cute for kids just starting out this way if they lost another big deal or didn’t really like it. OK found better.
3.0,Fabric is a nice quality but fit is very small with little stretch. Neck and arm holes are small.
3.0,A little bummed it didnt have any text like the picture suggested
3.0,so these were pretty good for the price .. great quality .. nice case and everything you would expect from DG ... on thing my client complained about was that they were a tad too big for her face ... but other than that .. they were pretty nice ..
3.0,My big suitcase would never lock. It was broken. But for the money very satisfied
3.0,"Super cute. And very lightweight. However, new material is thinner than I expected it to be."
3.0,The style was great but I use the sizing chart and it was gigantic on me.
3.0,"Though these are 32x32, they are tight and little short.  If you normally wear this size I would suggest going up in size.  I usually can wear a 32 waist but I can't get these zipped up or buttoned.  The material is soft and durable, but I'm not too fond of the slits in the knees or the unhemmed look."
3.0,"soft, long, no hem - you get what you pay for"
3.0,"Disappointed no paperwork with watch, at all."
3.0,"These chains were good enough for the project at hand and such a reasonable price. One can tell that they're not high end chains but very acceptable, shiny and strong. I liked them enough to order 3 more but my second order showed up two chains short. Only one chain was in the package. They refunded the difference to me so I ordered three more. I'm still waiting to see if the complete pack of three arrive this time."
3.0,Fits awkwardly for me. Fabric was decent.
3.0,A lot smaller than I thought. I got them for my husband and they just barely fit his ear. It would’ve been nice to show them in someone’s ear for comparison.
3.0,Fabric is to thin. Not a very good quality
3.0,"Wore on long flight...16 hours; no arch support, but very comfortable and kept my feet warm in flight!"
3.0,This shirt looks exactly as it does in the photo. It is very stylish. The material used is of a low-quality. Lots of loose threading all around the buttonholes. I would recommend cleaning this shirt in cold water only and allow it to hang dry. a dryer even on low heat would probably destroy this shirt. The sizes run very small so order at least one full size larger then what you would normally wear.
3.0,"This dress is huge! I’m a size 4 so I ordered the small. It fits more like a large. It fit like a big T-shirt rather than a dress that’s suppose to form to my body. So if you typically wear a large or xl and can order a small or medium, go for it. Otherwise do not order this dress."
3.0,I should have known this would have been like the other flowy dresses with a smocked top. They remind me of dresses you’d get on a cruise or at a stall randomly in a mall or warm climate tourist event.<br /><br />The fabric is wrinkly and seems shrinkable- though I haven’t washed it yet. The sleeves on this are also chincy. They fall in the right spot but it’s like a strip of fabric not the flouncy look in the pic. I don’t know I just don’t care for this. For a swim cover up yes but not for anything nice or that Pinterest look. It’s too cheap looking imo. 3 stars for a nice swim beach cover up but that’s it.
3.0,Good quality material but it runs a little big..<br />they raise up so much you see them over my jeans no matter what I do and you don’t even notice it because it’s such smooth material.<br />since its comfortable To wear I’ll use them on my “ female” days lol
3.0,"definitely run small, and tags torn out was a concern."
3.0,It’s way too big- however in New England it’s great for wearing in the morning when it’s chilly and I’m getting kids off to school. Very warm and cozy
3.0,"The dress is well made, however it runs very big I believe about 2 sizes too big. I like the dress so I'll have to get it adjusted to fit me."
3.0,"I saw this and thought it was so clever, artsy and hilarious. Unfortunately the quality of the print was rather pixelated and not so crisp. Also fit a bit small, I ended up returning."
3.0,"Very nice bracelets. Nice quality & sturdy. They were too long/big, so had to send them back. Liked them otherwise."
3.0,Too large but beautifull
3.0,Super cute but a tad bit small. I also think the inside was sewn in backwards. Love the shorts though.
3.0,I like the neck opening to be wider on this type of shirt. It was normal size
3.0,Some of the underwear were torn at seams when I opened package. But the price wasn’t bad
3.0,"I loved how these boots looked, but they are very tight. My feet are a true size 7, therefore I ordered these boots in size 7. They fit super snug and after 2 minutes wearing them I could not feel blood circulating to my feet. They are very cute, but if you order them, do so a whole size up."
3.0,"This dress is very stylish. Bought the largest size they had. But it was too tight. Perhaps they need to make a women's size in this dress. Then it might fit someone of my stature. 5'8"" 160 lbs."
3.0,"Overall its not a bad buy.  If you follow the two sizes up, as described, then it fits the way it should.  The only complaint I have is the way the hood fits.  I thought it would be looser, but still not bad.  For the cost, its a pretty good deal."
3.0,These shoes will fit perfect if my daughter had narrow feet.
3.0,"These feel light weight as opposed to the OEM ones. Hopefully they will be durable. The “black” color is more of a charcoal grey. However, they are designed for the 38mm. The TPU case doesn’t fit the 40mm. If you have the 40mm I would suggest finding a product specifically designed only for the 40mm"
3.0,It's kinda cheesy but I may pull itoff
3.0,You kind of get what you pay for. Not the best quality. It’s not overly flattering but I wear it around the house so I wasn’t too concerned.
3.0,Gift was disappointing!  Stones and mounting<br />Very small
3.0,Bigger than an 18 gauge. But not necessarily 16. They're also super noticeable still
3.0,"The items arrived quickly, but didn't fit like nor was the natural shape of the dresses."
3.0,"it is light weight and works ok, so long as you are in constant direct sunlight. not gunna work in the Pacific NW, or even just intermittent cloudy days."
3.0,I love the colors and material but fits too small. I brought the largest size they had but I wished they offered it in a larger size
3.0,"I purchased this hand harness bracelet by Dhnewsun because I really liked the look of it. Shipping did take a pretty long time because it's coming from China I think, so it took almost a month to be delivered. It was perfectly undamaged when received, and came in a simple little envelope. The whole setup is pretty cute, but it really doesn't fit comfortably. The ring can be adjusted to fit any finger size pretty much, and the bracelet is super adjustable too, but the whole thing is just too big. It slides around side to side a lot and it just isn't something I'd be able to wear for a long time. And the chain for the bracelet part is super long so it just dangles there which is pretty annoying. It's pretty and definitely sparkly, but it's not really worth the long wait.<br /><br />I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

3.0,"This is a fairly well-made sun hat that fits my large head nicely, keeps the sun out of eyes, and it is foldable thanks to the wire insert. It's got a nice dotted lining and a bow in the back. Overall, very cute, very practical, and the sort of item I will certainly use in the summer."
3.0,"Got these for children as practice rings.. if they keep these safe then they will be given a real gold ring. One of my boys has skin like mine, and his was worn night & day. Within a week the gold started to chip off. Glad I got the silver plated gold so I can get the remaining off & he has a nice silver ring!"
3.0,"I ordered according to the measurement chart, but this dress kept shifting over my chest, trying to expose my bra. Big boob problems, maybe? But if you're well endowed up there, pass on this dress. It fit great elsewhere, but the tie/bow kept undoing itself due to how silky smooth the fabric is. The dress' fabric is also kinda thin, so you could see the bumps from my undergarments. I got the orange and white one, and you'll definitely need to wear something under it.<br /><br />Did get me a lot of compliments and is very pretty and flattering, especially for my hourglass figure, but like I said - the fabric moves around far too easily. Gonna need to pin it at the side so I don't flash my high school students."
3.0,"the watch is awesome, but it seems to rub the skin off my wrist no matter how tight or loose I have it."
3.0,Brings some humor to the work environment!
3.0,I should have ordered a XL. The stitches were loose in the front. Overall it was ok
3.0,Lovely color though lighter than the royal purple I expected. Fabric on thin side but that's what makes it wearable all year. Pulls across back because of yoke design. and smaller through bust than expected but I do have a DD cup size. Order up a size if full figured. Still deciding if I will keep.
3.0,It fit but thd shirt is really thin
3.0,"So I am going to keep these because I still like them, but I was not sent the color/pattern that I actually chose."
3.0,These are a nice idea but they have one big flaw. They pad your ears alright but since they have no elastic they slip off the glasses every time you take your glasses off. Add a little elastic.
3.0,The top fits kinna weird weird but the skirt is awesome!
3.0,"This does fit smaller than the size I thought would fit, it's quality and price is what you pay for. I bought a Xtra large it fits like a medium"
3.0,There are no steel bones as the product description states. It fits fine but does not control my waist. It doesn't serve it's purpose and was a waste of money.
3.0,I thought I liked the material at first..until it started turning fuzzy if touched to much. And since it was for my 9 yr old the sleeves started getting white fuzz first. Kinda like if it was rubbed to much idk. Not ideal material 🤷‍♀️
3.0,These are okay. Not quite as I was expecting. Colors are just as shown in picture
3.0,"This is really pretty, but a bit awkward to wear."
3.0,"I wish it was a little longer, it look just like the picture."
3.0,"Little bit too thin for my liking, but definitely better than the disposable ones!"
3.0,Good fit and feel. Most of the patterns look very girly in person. I only ended up wearing the more bold colors.
3.0,"this case basically doubles the thickness of my iphone 4S. it's really bulky in the pocket, very annoying at times as your trying to put it in or get it out. also the case does get your phone hot when charging.<br /><br />on the good side, the case's bulk allows it to absorb a large impact. it's a necessary evil if you want the utmost protection. there may be slimmer solutions that provide similar protection."
3.0,smudges easily.
3.0,I got the 2x and I'm 5'7&#34; and it was a bit short
3.0,exactly what I expected.
3.0,comes large.
3.0,"This outfit is adorable, but it runs way big. I purchased it for my son's baptism, but it runs big. I purchased the 3 month and it is the same size as his 9 month clothes."
3.0,"Nice material, just did not fit my body type"
3.0,"Not what I expected. Perhaps,  in ignorance, that’s my fault. Flimsy and permanently creased.  Definitely not a helmet…it’s a mask.  I couldn’t get myself to return it, like I said I just misunderstood the title. The picture makes it look like it has structure. Trust me. Nope. It does not."
3.0,"This was bought as a gift, one of my daughter's birthday presents.  She was very taken with the design and seemed genuinely pleased with it.  Unfortunately, she decided to wear it to work, at which time she discovered that the lobster clasp doesn't open - a fact that has been responsible for other disparaging reviews before mine.  I'm generously awarding this jewelry a 3; it earned full marks for design, but none for workmanship or quality control."
3.0,This dress is so comfortable in hot weather.  Has great style.  It did shrink when I washed it even though I didn't put it in the dryer
3.0,I like the style and how light this bag is. It's smaller than i thought.
3.0,nice sandle
3.0,Pretty from the front
3.0,"i was very excited to use them on a 3 weeks trip to france ,they did hold a lot of clothes but the zipper broke on 2 of the bags ! and by the time i came back it was too late to return them !"
3.0,These are nice.  Would have liked them to be a bit more bulky or thicker.  Satisfied in any event.
3.0,"I love how the bra feels, color is pretty and just as pictured.  Only thing I dont like is it doesn't keep my boobs in place well.. Works better with a tank to help keep the bra where its supposed to be.  Still worth the buy.  Fits true to size"
3.0,Longer than pictured. Hot to sleep in when you were expecting short
3.0,This piece is so beautiful I loved the look of it but the bar that goes through the nose was too short for me😭
3.0,Made for much smaller feet.  I donated them.
3.0,I'm not trying yet .but good.
3.0,They are warm and soft but the touchscreen finger doesn’t work.
3.0,"I purchased this watch band, so I could quickly strap my watch around my ankle when doing kettlebell exercises.  For that application it is great.  I’m disappointed that in day to day life this will fall off.  Removing an item from a bag, collecting a child from a car seat, or when going in and out of a pocket, You might find your watch face down on the concrete as I have, or even scarier find your watch missing.<br /><br />My watch now has damage to the screen.  I’m grateful I still have my watch though.<br /><br />May 2022 update.<br />This thing sucks.  It comes off when I sleep… it comes off when I pick up my child… stays on for workouts but it literally will come undone when putting on sweater sleeve."
3.0,I liked the rimless design but these shades were a bit too small for my face. I had to return them. Good quality though.
3.0,"I wasn't crazy about the sizing on the socks and the fabric tore on first pair I wore.  2nd and 3rd pairs held up better, but were still snug. They will stay on because they are so tight. These are great in theory but lackluster in quality..."
3.0,"Ordered 3x. I wear US size 1x women's generally, and a 40DD bra. I should have gone with 4x just because of the breasts. It fit fine other than the bust. It also has a stitch flaw right in the center of the bust line. The fabric feels like light spring jacket material. It also doesn't relax well, but for the price, it's ok. You pay cheap, you get cheap. If I paid $40 for this, I would be pissed! Also,  torso is short on the dress. Buttons were too high."
3.0,A little big. Not a good fit.
3.0,"High Impact: Perfect. Well supported and had no issues.<br />Fit: Little snug at the bottom of the chest. I suppose the fitting department was only thinking the chest was what increased, but there would be no additional inches in the back to cause fitting problems.<br />Clasps: the meshing that the clasps are attached to are itchy!! I am hoping that another round in the washer will help, but it was not comfortable at all - especially with all the moving around that I do with Insanity.<br />Probably won't get any more of these."
3.0,The cap sleeves stuck out instead of lying flat
3.0,I’m a 7 1/2 and I bought a 7 thinking they would fit a little better. Definitely should’ve sized up to an 8. Love the shoe very cute
3.0,"Too big. I normally wear med this med was too big for the pink sleeveless. 149lb 5,2” dd bust. The light blue was perfect in med."
3.0,"It looks less than quality.  Some of the &#34;toes&#34; are painted black some not.  Upper paw 3 not colored in, lower paw 1 not colored in. It's larger than I thought it would be. That's personal preference, of course.  Overall, it's okay, but I wouldn't buy again and I may ask my daughter if she wants it, but it will not be a Christmas gift as planned."
3.0,"It is a nice looking hat, however the IDF shield logo is screen-printed and not embroidered.  Otherwise it is a good  produce overall."
3.0,"THERE ARE NO POCKETS. STITCHING IS UNRAVELING AT THE WRISTS AND THUMB HOLES, HAVEN'T EVEN WASHED THEM YET. SIZING IS NOT AMERICAN. SIZE 4X IS EQUAL TO A LARGE BUT A SLIM LARGE, NO ROOM FOR ANY TUMMY OR BOOBS, AND YOU WON'T WANT TO BE 40LBS OVERWEIGHT WEARING THESE JACKETS, TWO PIGS IN A BLANKET IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU. THE ASSORTMENT OF COLORS WAS AMAZING. IF THIS BRAND WOULD ADD POCKETS, IMPROVE ON THE QUALITY AND NOT RAISE THE PRICE, I WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN. $14.99 IS THE WINNING PRICE FOR THESE JACKETS, AND THESE JACKETS WERE PRICED ABOVE THAT AT AROUND $17.99. I CAN GET MUCH BETTER QUALITY FOR THE SAME PRICE IN THE STORE HERE. COMING FROM CHINA, THEIR PRICING SEEMS A BIT HIGH."
3.0,Bought directly from CLIC (sorry Amazon).  They are quite small and very tight on my head.  My hat size is 7 1/4 so maybe it is my problem but if you have a slightly larger than normal head size be forewarned.
3.0,Doesn't look that good in person.
3.0,Good construction with nice fleece on the inside. But it's just much too long. I bought this for a very average 19-month old and it fit a 4-year old!
3.0,"Loved this dress as soon as I put it on....hugged me just enough in the hips and butt to make me feel sucked in, then, I realized, as I have so many times before, that I didn't have enough boobage to fill up the top part. I'm a 38C usually and my hips are around 48 inches with a 38 inch waist. This dress is obviously made for a woman way more well than I. I tried every which way to make it look right to no avail. It's so aggravating. Nothing ever fits me right. I'll probably keep it and wear some sort of lace thing under it which will diminish the beauty of the dress, but such is my life with a disproportional figure, I suppose."
3.0,Neck closure is too big for a toddler. I'm going to have to re-sew it.
3.0,Not exactly as expected
3.0,Too small according dimensions
3.0,Very difficult to shorten band. Took me about an hour. Still isn't right but I'll take it to a jeweler next time.
3.0,"/beautiful robe, great for Texas summer heat. my only draw back is the Teal robe I ordered was missing the belt."
3.0,"I paid less than $5 for this, so I don't expect perfection.  It looks pretty, so it's fulfilling.  I love the contrast of the rose colored numbers against the white background.  However, when it arrived, the plate on the back of the face was not connected.  After pressing it in place, it's stayed in place, and I wear it every day.  The color of the watch band is not as vibrant as it looks in the picture, and I have a small wrist, so the band is a little big."
3.0,"It looks good but his bag is not real leather as stated in the advertisement and the two &#34;zippered pockets&#34; on the front are only decorations, not pockets."
3.0,I like the material and all they are just a snug large
3.0,Not  bad.Not a very good quality.Good for the money.
3.0,Dress is too long for me.  I'm 5'2&#34;.
3.0,Small and short fir the plus size
3.0,Not as big as I would have liked. Don’t feel like wool
3.0,too tight at the waist
3.0,"i love it. very nice fitted, not see throught defitnetly a steal for the price. the only complain is they send me the wrong color."
3.0,"The harem portion of these are nicely baggy as expected but I'm on the small side and I'd say the waist is quite small.  The waist does stretch and I pulled them up to a 'high waist' position so they were comfortable.  Otherwise, I'm happy with them."
3.0,too hot for summer wear
3.0,"I bought 6 pieces of this earrings. It is really good. The color is really nice and I got good feedback and my friends also asked me to order this earrings for them. But despite of buying so many pieces, last month when I ordered this to gift my sister the earrings was kind of black and that disappointed me very much. The color of the earrings did not satisfy me. The upper most part of the earring was left to be colored and it looked like black earring instead of gold. This takes a lot of time to get delivered and that's completely fine but we all are passionate about the things that we order and we want it to be good because we r blindly trusting you guys and buying things without even seeing or touching them.So it is also your responsibility to give us good and fresh product."
3.0,The lenses are a little too see-through. I do love the style of these sunglasses. I’m hoping I can find some with darker lenses.
3.0,"These are not flattering and look like pajama pants... so I do not suggest them for work. As for gym pants or ""joggers"", the material just does not seem right. I ended up giving them to my 70 year old mother and she loved them. They were lose enough to help her recover from her knee surgery and for sure lose enough to wear to physical therapy and trendy enough for her to run to the store. For someone who is older, this works fine."
3.0,Here's what I'd say. I think it improves visibility while driving at night by removing glare by about 15-20%. If it's enough for you to buy it and wear it - then this is a good product for you.
3.0,"I was so excited about this coat and when it came I was a bit disappointed. The jacket is large, heavy and rough. Also, The color is not as vibrant as I thought it would be. I do like the design. The picture is similar to the design, minus the purple having more orange in it. Overall, I will &#34;make it work&#34; but am not completely satisfied. Order one size down in the Elf Sack clothing."
3.0,"Ok, runs big though."
3.0,"Just received my corset yesterday, of course I couldn't wait to try on.<br />First thing I noticed was it wasn't as heavy as the waist cincher I  bought a year ago,also it has less bones,the fabric is thinner.<br />Still looks well made though.<br />Once I &#34;season&#34; it I'LL write more.<br />Jeri"
3.0,"I find the fabric a bit uncomfortable, particularly around the shoulder seams."
3.0,They are ok. Very tight to screw in. Should be just a tad longer.
3.0,"Fit as expected, fits true to size- appropriate delivery time and pricing. Would buy from this vendor<br />Again."
3.0,"It’s pretty, but really tight"
3.0,"are soft, comfortable and the bad thing is they are a bit heavy, I thought it was lighter, but I buy them and I'll use the same. good for walking, not tired, generally recommend"
3.0,"Excited to find an Interpol tee shirt cut for women, but was sadly disappointed. The fabric is rough with very little stretch to it and the cut is more of a classic unisex tee; high neck, tight at the bust but loose in the waist and sleeves. If you want an old school tee, go for it. If you’re looking for a fitted woman’s tee, keep searching."
3.0,"Style, length and fit were nice but beware of the thin ribbed material (wife beater like, sorry for the horrible term). It hugs any curves you have. :/"
3.0,"The material is really nice, but runs small. Definitely order a size up from your regular. Other than that, cute dress"
3.0,Not a great material. It was very unflattering for my shape
3.0,Waited a month. Sent back. Nice material
3.0,Not at all long like in the picture. I had a hard time keeping it wrapped around me. It was very pretty though and the material matched my dress well.
3.0,The butt area is to small I had to give it away. I have a small butt and it was still in my crack to much.
3.0,Very small piece. Read the measurements.
3.0,"I love how the style and material is, however, from the day it was delivered, the underwire has already slipped out from the left side.<br /><br />I was not able to return as i had to leave town and was back after a week.<br /><br />Eventually the right side wire came off as well."
3.0,These glasses are Very lose and they came with something smudged on the lenses that I can’t get off completely.
3.0,I just don't see how that's even possible...I had measured my ankle and it's around 8 inches. I can't get it over past my feet and I wear 7 1/2 shoe size. It's not really that large enough to stretch over my foot. Maybe it's small enough to go over a little girl's foot. I'm very disappointed that I can't wear it on my ankle. I'm just gonna have to wear it as a bracelet then.
3.0,It is a bit thin but does the job. Looks super cute on!! My 5 year old loves it.
3.0,Bought crop shirt for grand but Too small
3.0,It was a bit too small for me. I gave it to my sister. The hat is stylish and seems to be made fairly well.
3.0,I thought this purse would be more like a satchel with more body to it.  I do like the color.
3.0,"I was hoping this skirt would fit me even though the product description said it would be too large. Size aside, I expected the skirt to be a little different. I bought navy and the material looked like scratchy denim. The skirt didn't really poof right either. It might need a small petticoat or something if you want it to look like the picture. Other than that, it was alright."
3.0,Very cute<br />Thought card would be larger<br />Would have loved if card was more feminine<br />Too plain<br />Texture of card rough<br />I bought Grandson card with train necklace<br />Card was more cuter
3.0,One small snag on it and the top and bottom half colors didn't match as well as I thought it did online. Comfortable and fits well though.
3.0,Order a medium fit but was still way to baggy of a fit for my 5'6 height and 125lb frame.
3.0,"looks nice, but is very light weight."
3.0,"I bought this as a gift and it looks amazing. It's just as described and looks gorgeous. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come in a box, just bubble wrap so I had to go find a box since it was a gift.<br />---------------<br />26 Dec Edit<br /><br />Before they even took it out of the box the butterfly broke off. She didn't care since it was an easy fix. She absolutely loved it, but I still had to take off a star since it had already started to fall apart before it was even worn."
3.0,This swimsuit would fit fine if it had a longer torso.  I ordered the 1x and it was tight and short in the torso length.  I was so excited about this as it looked like it was going to fit well.  I would say go up one size and that should do the trick for myself it would have.  I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  Very nice fabric and quality just runs a bit small.
3.0,no the greatest
3.0,It's okay but it doesn't look as nice as I thought it would.
3.0,"Beautiful ring, can't wear it other than special occasions because I've already bent it twice getting it snagged on things."
3.0,Overall the satin strings are nice but a few of the claw closures are weak a couple are broken.
3.0,It's a little narrow in the sleeve
3.0,I like the design. Thanks.
3.0,"The skirt on this dress is less full than it appears in the photos and the fabric is a rougher than I was expecting. As other have mentioned, the triple straps are also a bit annoying. Overall, it's a cute design but weighed down a bit by the quality, so I'm giving it an average rating."
3.0,The glasses look great on my daughter. They were a gift and with her blond hair the color was perfect.
3.0,"The quality of the pants is great, the material is perfect. They do run a little large in my opinion. I would like it if they were a little bit more tapered at the waist, but these are a great pair of pants for the price."
3.0,This item works well but it's not easy taking the watch in and out.
3.0,"I use the drawstring to make this as tight as possible, but each night, I wake up and the wrap/cap is not on my head. I don't use grease on my hair, as I use a moisturizer and rinse my hair each nite, braid it in 4 plats (if you remember what they were called in the old days), let it air dry and then before going to bed, I put on the wrap/cap. I don't move around much in my sleep, as when I go to sleep, I cross my arms over my chest on my back, and when I awake, I am in the same position most times. BUT the wrap/cap is mostly off my head and on the pillow. I do turn my head from side to side though, which could be the cause of it not being on my head when I awake. All-n-all, I like the feel, the thickness, and the colors."
3.0,"These tops looks so cute on the model! And they look the same in person, but the sizing is weird, at least on me. The top was simultaneously wide in the body and tight in the chest (and I do not have a disproportionately small waist - quite the opposite). The material and pattern were as advertised. Could be super cute if it fits you properly."
3.0,Very difficult staying together with mask.  Returned .
3.0,"These are my favorite leggings for lounging and for working out! I've ordered several pairs. (I just ordered them again). They are high-waisted and don't stretch out and keep their shape; mostly-- the ones I've had the longest have definitely lost some of their shape at the waist but that's fine, they've been retired to purely sleep/lounge wear. No tears or visible wear along the inseam for my fellow thick thigh ladies.<br /><br />I order them in a medium- I'm 5'1, 165(ish) and carry my weight in my hips, butt, and thighs and they fit perfect and always have, even when I was at my heaviest (175ish)<br /><br />Edit: These leggings have seriously taken a turn for the less good. While I still like them, they aren't nearly as thick and plushy as they used to be. They're thin and have been reregulated to my cardio/hiking pants. Such a shame, these used to be great. Down-graded from a 5-stars"
3.0,Pretty! The friend I gave it to said she liked! Is just so small!!!
3.0,"They were really cute. However, they smelled funky when I took them out of the package."
3.0,I love this shirt and the material is light unfortunately it runs small. Size up!
3.0,"Product is great however it runs small. There's no size chart so unfortunately I had know way of knowing. Upon receiving, I knew I needed a larger size. Started a return process as well as ordered a new size. Sadly, I had to pay to return item AND was charged a restocking fee!!!!! So I lost $28 just to try on a jacket that I thought was my size!!!!<br />Only order if you know this will fit so you aren't out extra $$$"
3.0,Pero muy grande para mi mano
3.0,Looks great not made for busty women.
3.0,Nice bag for daily used
3.0,Nice and comfortable but I wear a 8 and it fits like a 7.5.
3.0,"These sandals were a steal at $26 but when I wore them for 30 minutes they started chaffing my little pinkies to the point of bleeding on both feet...no major medical crisis but just annoying...maybe it is because they are new and i have to ""break-them-in""...or maybe its because they are not as great quality as they claim to be.<br />I originally wanted 9 1/2 but for some reason in England half sizes don't exsist..!??! I won't return them but I'll just band-aid my pinkies and go about my business...slower though."
3.0,Couldn't fit my cellphone through the opening.
3.0,"A nice pair of thigh highs, but not nearly as opaque as I had hopes (I got the black ones)"
3.0,Like it .. Just wish they had different sizes
3.0,"I do really like the Robeez for my baby, but you can buy shoes that are styled very VERY similarly (leather and soft-soled, even look just like Robeez) for half the price at Target. Unless you just *must* have that tiny tag that says ""Robeez"" on it, save yourself the $$ and go to Target."
3.0,Horrible Material
3.0,looked great for my Aladdin themed wedding but it broke very easily.
3.0,fit was tight; had to return.  The next size was too big.
3.0,Fell apart after a few short weeks
3.0,"It's ok, though it was going to be a bit larger"
3.0,"The material is OK, and the size (large) is also OK, but the problem is that the design itself has a problem, that when you bring your arms forward or raise them, you feel the sleeves tighten around the arms. Obviously the arm openings should be redesigned to allow to give free movement."
3.0,"It's a beautiful bracelet, but the one I received caught on my clothes and had really sharp edges.  I returned it."
3.0,The package that I received didn't match the description and the picture. It's easy to get broke when I wear it. And it's shorter than the picture shows.
3.0,I thought it came with a undershirt but my mother loves it thank you came on time and its pretty soft cloth
3.0,Really like the product but they were either too small and the next size up was too big. I like how they offer in petite length
3.0,"The material is awesome, but the cut was just way too short and tight. Really wanted to like this one. Would probably be perfect if you are under 5'11""."
3.0,Like them except the toiletry back is already tearing after only a 3 week tour.
3.0,"Little too big, was looking for something more dainty"
3.0,"The belt is very heavy and was a bit larger than I needed. They should offer S, M, and L options."
3.0,"As they say, you get what you pay for.  These ran small.  Ended up giving to the Goodwill."
3.0,the halter string is awkwardly shaped which makes the breasts look flat and almost come out. Better for someone flat chested. What I did was tie a knot at the top of the breast part so the 2 sides stayed together and now I love it. The ties in the back and sides are beautiful.
3.0,Makes hard to twist hair around wand but definitely much easier than a glove
3.0,"i purchased her normal size. the leo fits her body, however the sleeves are tight when she bends her arms. i wouldn't recommend her wearing this for practice because of the bending they do and that restriction will annoy and inhibit her ability to move freely. she will use this to play in around the house. i might cut the sleeves off since she cannot wear it to practice."
3.0,Ordered 2 pair. One red and one black. Both colors were wrong. Got orange and white. Although nice disappointed that they are not exactly what I ordered.  May just keep them and order a black pair and hope I get that color as the they are really cute.
3.0,The gold finish is faded after only being worn four times.
3.0,"Product fits the glasses, but not real snug. I have a feeling I should have gone for the premium lenses but these will do for now. Polarization is excellent and really opens up the field of vision. I just wish they fit a little more snug to the rims."
3.0,So far the shoes are holding together but the lights quit working after the fist day.
3.0,It just ok not special.
3.0,It did not fit well and was too small.
3.0,I was hoping this would fit! I’m a size 12/14 the xl was skin tight! I gave it to my friend that’s a size 8 & it fit her perfectly.
3.0,this is the second time I have rated this and nothing has changed
3.0,"I was disappointed...I read the reviews and knew it ran small but, it was EXTREMELY small!  I measured my head and fell well within the guidelines.  I don’t have a large head.  I could barely get this on... the tag shows size medium...my granddaughter who is 6 might be able to wear this...but it’s not made to fit adults.  I love the colors and it’s made well.  The company needs more availability on size selection if they expect to sell these!  Unfortunately I did return it and I’m looking for something else with a visor to wear under my bike helmet."
3.0,"These pants are actually SO comfortable. They're light weight and my favorite pants to wear to sleep in. However, the seams are all coming out. I have threads hanging from my ankle and the strings that you tie at the waist. There's a metal ring around where the strings come out that isn't attached to the pants anymore. And I have four pairs that are having all the same problems."
3.0,"The skirt itself was nice. Decent quality. But clearly made only for tiny people! I’m a size 12. Not knowing which to get, I ordered both large and extra large. Neither fit!! And I mean very small!"
3.0,For a 10g it looked like a normal earring ir is a little scratchy though quality and price are not bad. Nothing fancy
3.0,"It was exactly what I was looking for in design & length, but it slid down constantly."
3.0,"Suspender ok.  Not really good quality, but it was cheap."
3.0,Its really big!
3.0,More for prom night.
3.0,"They work but they're so hard to get on and off! especially around the Ankle.<br />The fit is true to size in the foot and the shaft best suited for thinner legs.<br />I don't really like the ties because once you tie them....they really stick out.<br />The sole is thinner but the bed feels like Evo foam and that's nice.<br />If you walk a lot, your feet will get cold, even with wool socks.<br />They do stain if you get them wet...even after applying spray protection. They brush up clean very well - but after one time of being wet for too long they deform and you can see the stain area.<br />The bottom of the boot is good on ice but wearing cleats is a better idea. (especially in Alberta)"
3.0,This outfit is adorable on but the second time my toddler wore it the bows on the sides of the shorts fell off. Very poor sewing. And I have seen other reviews from Products that come from China about how it as soon as people wear them the buttons fall off. I wish these companies would do a finer job sewing things on like buttons and bows.
3.0,Size is perfect to store in small bag and use on bright sunny days.  It was not as easy in opening and had to really press hard up for umbrella to lock.
3.0,"Love that fact that after 50 years the Chiefs won another Super Bowl. The hat it self is small, not very comfortable! I guess you get what you pay for!"
3.0,"Love Stance socks but these got a hole randomly after the first time wearing them.  Might be a defect, as my others didn't have the same problem, but that is frustrating given the cost for a pair of these sock.s"
3.0,I'm small on the top but medium on the bottom so I got both sizes. The medium swimsuit was adorable (better quality then the small) but the top was too big. The small swimsuit didn't look like the one in the picture plus it had a small hole in the strap ...did not like it at all so I'm returning them both. :(
3.0,"Good product, made with quality material just a little too small"
3.0,"extremely big. not flattering. not as expected. wore once, and never again."
3.0,"The fabric is nice and soft and the colors are exactly as shown. I ordered an XXL based on the size chart. What I didn't like about the dress is that the middle band at the waist is serged in place on top and bottom so where I would have expected a firm non stretchy fabric to secure the waist, the fabric stretches and you can feel the serged seem pulling and if you pull to had it will pop.  There is also a gapping at the seam just under the arm pit.  I love the dress color, the  length and that it has POCKETS as it fits my torso length so am going to keep it and fix the side seam and the waist tension."
3.0,Was hoping to wear as outer cover over jeans with tank but looks like a robe. Material is nice though.
3.0,This scarf was small & thin
3.0,"I love this ring, it's so pretty but the band bends. I'm afraid it's going to break if I wear it and that makes me very sad."
3.0,"Fairly well made, the velcro patches are a full inch wide. I have a very large head and these give about 1 1/4 inch of velcro overlap. But they shrink 1/2 inch in the wash and if you dry these with heat the hooks in the velcro will break off and fly up in your face and everywhere. Line dry only due to the inferior quality of the velcro used."
3.0,"The hoops were nice and solid but the diamonds were practically microscopic. Also, one of the backs was giving some resistance when I tried to push it in. The earring butterfly backs were also small and therefore difficult to grasp. These are being returned. Nice idea in theory, but these failed to meet the mark."
3.0,"I love the coat and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. But, after 4 months of wearing it every other day or even every few days, the zipper started splitting - it's just a cheaper plastic zipper. When I emailed the company and Amazon, it seemed like they didn't want to fix the problem and I eventually was able to return it and get my money back. However, getting my money back apparently meant that I would only get a portion of my money back, even though it was a defective product. I did order another coat just like it, but I am having the cheap plastic zipper replaced with a metal one right away."
3.0,"I used the arrow for my daith piercing. The jewel at the end of the arrow fell out after about a week, and after wearing it for about 2 months, my ear is turning green. Probably not the best earring for a piercing that stays in for an extended time. They did send a complimentary extra earring, which I thought was nice."
3.0,Doesn't hold
3.0,bit small
3.0,"Bought these for my daughter, I was reading that you pay for the “oink” sound and neither of them make the sound. Also she walks weird not sure if it’s because of the foam on the bottom of the shoe but her feet always slide sideways if that makes any sense."
3.0,Adorable but pants always ride up
3.0,Was more of a mustard color and dress material was kind of stiff
3.0,Ordered an XL<br />Fits like a M<br />The fabric is adorable though.
3.0,"It’s too large for my average sized head. The “patch” or whatever you call it is a flimsy iron on which no doubt will peel off in no time. I started my return, was immediately refunded without having to return the hat. I’ll be donating it."
3.0,"I really had high hopes for this item, but it just didn’t fit properly. It’s not that it was too tight, it’s just that it didn’t drape properly like the picture. I’m only 5,6”, but I felt it was best suited for someone around 5’2”. It seemed shorter through the torso and legs than expected. I purchased a medium. I might not have had the issue had I purchased a large, but then it may have been too baggy."
3.0,Cute but a weird cut that makes it a hard thing to wear.
3.0,"Wish it would have come with directions so you would know how to put it on the 42mm watch. At the least, put in the part that attaches to your watch so you can have the same color."
3.0,"The ring shipped quick which is good because I need to get it cleaned before giving this as a gift. The downfall of ulcer I suppose. The ring was so tarnished,it was Black. But still a nice ring"
3.0,"Some pieces were absolutely beautiful, others I had no idea what I was looking at"
3.0,"I've only had them a few days. The primary pro here is you get four hematite bracelets at a reasonable price. If you're a male or have arm hair, the bands catch and pull on them. The bands don't look as flush as the photos would indicate. Elastic bands hold the bracelets together, I assume these will eventually wear out and break. Again, it's not a bad deal given the price, but don't expect an out of this world experience. I don't have arthritis, so I can't attest to whether it helps. There's been some mentions of helping anxiety/depression with hematite....I can say that there is no help that I've noticed."
3.0,I love everything about this bra! The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is that I had to sew the clip back on the strap the first time I wore it. Easy fix for a fantastic bra!
3.0,They seemed like a good shoe. The 46 was too small even though I have Bontrager shoes of the same size. Too narrow as well. I usually get a wide shoe size.
3.0,Run a little small especially after washing. But seems to be comfortable and warm for my granddaughter who’s not quite 4
3.0,Runs small and has a weird fit.
3.0,I bought a size larger and it was too small. I guess this is incentive for me to lose weight. I did not see any obvious product flaws other than sizing is not what is advertised.
3.0,"I'm 5'4, 125-130 lbs and I feel the small ran quite large. The elastic in the waist is much too loose so it just hangs and doesn't look as pictured. If I wrap the belt all the way around and not just tie it in the front (I'm assuming that's how it is supposed to be, based on the pictures), it looks better. It's a really cute dress but the elastic waist definitely needs to be tighter."
3.0,The earrings themselves are kinda big for my 8 yr olds ears.
3.0,Wasn’t flattering for someone who’s 7 months pregnant. Was so sad bc the dress looked so cute. Dress seemed of good quality.
3.0,They are alright. A loose thread ended up with a hole in the sock.
3.0,I bought these for my 5 year old grandson and they are way to big.
3.0,Nice design  but the shirt runs small.
3.0,GreatLooking but a little tight
3.0,Bit narrower than another pair I bought that are almost exactly the same. I personally wish I chose another colour as these ones don't pop as much as I'd hoped. The colour isn't as bright as what my monitor was showing me online which is always a chance you take with these sorts of things. Wish they had a wider side available.
3.0,TYPcially wear a medium but ordered it large and still sent back for an xlarge. Very pretty.
3.0,"I bought this for a work costume party.  I was going as a witch.  With that said, the dress worked out ok.  The size was just right.  I am a 16-18 usually, and I ordered an XL.  However, if I were buying this to wear, day-to-day, it would not have been a good buy. The fabric is cheap and see through (very costume-ish material).  For the money and for my occasion, a good buy."
3.0,"It is a little tight around the chest.  I am a 40DD.  I did order my normal size, but their sizing is off a bit and on the smaller size. Should have gone up one size.<br />Light flowy material.  Color is spot on. Very pretty tank blouse.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the creases from packaging.  I can't get the lines out whatsoever!<br />I've tried hand washing it, and letting it hang to dry.<br />Tossed it in the dryer on cool setting, and still lines.<br />Not sure if an iron will take out these deep creases though."
3.0,Watch arrived with 2 dead batteries.
3.0,"Says Dark Grey in the description, but it definitely ended up being more of a taupe color."
3.0,"This product is kinda cheap. Bought for a rain dance, it didn't rain as expected."
3.0,"I adore the shirt, but it runs at least two sizes too small. Sigh."
3.0,Beautiful shirt and high quality. Just fits too tight for the size.
3.0,Took it for my daughter ‘s unicorn costume! Cute idea!  nice white hair but the colorful part was looking ugly... maybe with some brushing it could look better but I am not going to risk it. Also the horn needs to be reglued
3.0,"Great top, but runs small. I typically wear a small in women's active clothing and this fits TIGHT."
3.0,I liked the dress but the size runs small. I had to return.
3.0,It turned within a few days
3.0,"The costume was amazing at first the ganyu one but it started ripping apart after a few tries lmao, the bell too small, the little emeralds on the bow was falling off instantly, the chest part on the costume was ripping off from the string, the zipper isn’t even attached properly to the costume and I didn’t even know it had a zipper until now and once I zipped it down and it didn’t even zip back up even if I wasn’t wearing the costume, the gloves started ripping off fully on one finger and doesn’t even seem fixable now, I’m expecting for a new bodysuit and some new gloves cuz I didn’t pay 90 something dollars on a costume that’s already ripping apart"
3.0,"Got it on orange. Cute, not the best quality fabric, bow hangs funny, had to safety pin parts of the fabric on it back because it was seen with yellow thread on the top and the serged edge showed. If you can tack the bow on by hand, it would probably look better. We just used it for a short period, and it worked well most of the time. The bow had come off its original pin by te end of the event."
3.0,"Seemed nice, but scratch very easily."
3.0,I ordered this because it said there was a pocket. There is no pocket!! Very disappointed!
3.0,"These slippers are okay. My 8 yo son wears a size 4 shoe. I bought him the largest size of these a 5/6, and they are just barely big enough. His heel is all the way to the end. I wish there were more options for boys slippers!!"
3.0,"Really like it, but it keeps falling off."
3.0,"The dress doesn'the looks as nice as the picture. It'seems very stretchy, tight and will look flattering only on perfect hourglass figures, I think.  Thicker, non- stretch fabric should make a better silhouette. Disappointed."
3.0,"Very beautiful and nice fitting first 4-6 uses, then straps come undone a lot and top stretches to belly button after a few uses. I had to buy another a month later so it wouldn't come off in the ocean when I don't notice."
3.0,"Love the shirt overall - soft, comfy- but it fits like a xl and I ordered a small. My husband could wear it."
3.0,Just did not fit me right.  I did return them.
3.0,Much smaller than expected. For the price I expected a larger  dome.
3.0,"Great fit and quality, but looks matronly."
3.0,wasnt the right pattern
3.0,Not quite! It loses its adjustment in a few days and must be readjusted to my wrist. An annoying characteristic!
3.0,The quality is very nice. Only complaint is that the bracelets are wayyy to big. I tried adjusting it on my own with a thumb tack but it didn’t work out too well and I don’t really want to go to a jeweler. Any suggestions?
3.0,"The watch band edges are rounded, but the flaps of metal that have been bent over tend to jab, poke, and scratch the insides of your wrist. Also, the clasp mechanisms tend to pop off rather frequently and gets annoying. Was definitely a cheaper alternative to what I had originally intended to buy. but other than those 2 cons, you get what you paid for."
3.0,"Gorgeous dress but the main issues I had was that it was way to long! This would definitely fit someone say above 5’6 but definitely not someone my height standing at 5’2! Also, it’s only sheer in stretched areas so a nude bra would be beneficial."
3.0,"I thought I was getting a teal tie dye but it’s actually baby blue. I love the color but it’s not what I wanted (not returning because it’s still good quality). Either way, I wouldn’t get it if you’re looking for that blue-greenish teal"
3.0,"The look cute, but the material is not the best. You also have to buy it a size bigger."
3.0,"Nice hat, but too small for a big head"
3.0,Nice jeans but too big. They are stretch jeans but way too much for my comfort. I purchased a 2X but should have gone smaller. I will purchase these in another size and give another review.
3.0,their ok - but a bit small
3.0,Can't say anything really about this item.  I ordered wrong size.
3.0,"One of the arms falls off all the time.  Other then that, its a good product."
3.0,It’s cute but I’m allergic to nickel and this is not nickel free. Just the middle piece is bioflex.
3.0,"The earring posts were a little bent, but the earrings are cute!"
3.0,Needs better elastic top; heels wore quickly.  Nice and comfy until then!  Great for around house in winter time.
3.0,"I usually wear a 10 in womens..these were too wide an half size too big...they are so cushy inside, I will reorder smaller size"
3.0,"They are thin, slide down. I like the pockets but possibly if i had gotten a smaller size they may stay put. Oh well, can’t complain because the price was right!"
3.0,"The suit and matching hat were cute and appeared well made.  HOWEVER, I followed both the size chart (actually would have gone even larger based on the chart) and the recommended size from Amazon and it was huge.  The top sagged - even though it was a halter style - bottom was too long, and tummy area was loose.  Also, NO EXCHANGE option.  Returned."
3.0,Rubbed the back of my granddaughter’s ankles.
3.0,Kind of a weird shape and pretty cheap fabric.
3.0,The torso is short. It’s closer to an empire waist.
3.0,Weird fit!! Way too big!
3.0,"Flimsy, cheap, and runs small. I can't wear it."
3.0,"I think this might have looked better on someone very tall and thin, but then again, what doesn't look good on someone like that?"
3.0,These keep you cool if you have a good breeze otherwise they are miserably hot
3.0,"Soft and comfortable gloves, but don't provide the warmth that I was expecting from Thinsulate gloves."
3.0,Shiny silky material . Shows underwear lines easily . Not as flattering as I would like
3.0,"The sleeves are very tight, the rest of the dress is perfect and just as pictured"
3.0,"I love this top, very cute. Fits nicely.  Im 5.2 125 pounds 34c.  However, if you look close, the black die seems to be marbled. Im  sending it back as defective and see if I get a better one. And the cuffs are too wide. Will see what the 2nd one looks like."
3.0,"I am 5’9 135 and I bought a size small. The material is stretchy and great, however, the waist was massive on me and they wouldn’t stay up. The material is great, however, I may try to shrink them but they are still rather large. TMI but it gave me a massive camel toe and the only way to wear it was with a shirt that would cover..."
3.0,"id add a photo but it really doesnt matter, im 5'10 very slim and this is not long at all in the slightest, it cuts before my wrists and isnt stretchy, rips upon trying to stretch and is very very itchy to wear, i wanted something pretty goth, and the shading is a bit disappointing but it is warm"
3.0,I would get a size down. Runs a little big.
3.0,I ordered a half size up because of the reviews and even with my wide foot my regular size would’ve been fine. The color is also definitely a burgundy rather than a coffee color.
3.0,"Ordered this item as part of my 2.5 year old's Halloween costume. It took longer than expected to arrive, and was SO SMALL, leaving me in a scramble to find a size up in time for the holiday. Overall, it is well made and not see through at all, but my 30 pound, 37 in tall daughter was yelling &#34;too tight!&#34; as soon as I got it on her. When you hold it up it looks like it would comfortably fit a 1 year old, maybe 18 months. The leg holes were very tight and cut into my daughters little chubby thighs. I would think that if your child is very petite for their age, or skinny mini then this would work. I ended up visiting our local dance supply store and purchased the same leotard a size up in a child small. Luckily, Capezio allowed me a full refund without having to send the item back in, which was really convenient and allowed me to instantly apply my refund to the purchase of a leotard that fit. Minus the headache of having to hunt down a child size small, Capezio makes high quality dancewear, and provides excellent customer service. Recieved my refund within 24 hours!"
3.0,Beautiful with a collared white shirt and my jeans....nice look. Get it and enjoy it!
3.0,"Too short, and very tight in the chest (38C). I returned it; besides the material is cheezy.  I tried to make it work, but &#34;uh-uh!&#34;"
3.0,Pink parts need to be sewed on more securely.
3.0,"It’s a super cute shirt and seems to be put together well. But I’m 5ft 8 and the shirt hits just above my belly button. I guess if you like belly shirts it’d be cute, but I’m a 35 year old mom 😆."
3.0,"I get that  this is a low cut shirt but for someone who's not 20 and has some extra skin or weight (even a little bit) this is a total miss.  It is high neck, (not a huge deal), but the side drops all the way down to practically my hip.  In the back its cut same same.  I got it in the light purple color as I don't have any work out tanks that color.  CUTE.  I was trying to think how I could wear it and not be self conscious.  SPIN?  MAYBE  RUNNING?  TOO LOOSE...ELIPTICAL?  MAYBE..HIIT? NO  FABRIC WOULD GET CAUGHT ON SOMETHING.  Fabric is nice and soft though.  5'7 135 32D  Small was too messy and a bit long for my liking."
3.0,"Made me look fatter. Would work well for a person with a small chest, so it doesn't stick out all the way down to your knees and make you look huge."
3.0,night gown...
3.0,"I'm thinking about returning this and ordering a size up, because the actual size is too tight."
3.0,Very cute but absolutely no cushion!
3.0,This was really nice & perfect for the theme to was hoping to embrace!
3.0,"Very bulky for my wrist (which is thin but not super petite.)  Also, it seemed to over-record my steps and activity as compared to wearing it on my waist. I've gone back and bought a replacement waist clip from the same company (which works as well as the original manufacturer one.)"
3.0,"These pants fit comfortably around the waist and hips, but the legs are much too wide, much wider than what the picture shows.  I found the overall look unattractive."
3.0,I've had better ones but this isn't bad.
3.0,A bit low cut even for a mid- Some times I think I will pop out
3.0,"This is a cute dress but if it stretches too much the black parts will start to turn white.  I ordered an XL and it is a little on the small side but I can make it work.  I wear a L-XL/14-16 in dresses.  Just keep in mind that the dress will give somewhat, but it isn't super stretchy."
3.0,other than the plastic showing it's ok
3.0,It is okay because it is little lighter that i thought it would be. It is more like an extra layer than a full protection against cold weather ( of course for the leg)
3.0,I normally ware a size 10. I ordered 11 and were slightly small. I returned and order 12. Nice quality.
3.0,"The cuffs are way too tight to wear over the knee for me, so I wore them below the knee and folded over the leftover in my boots where no one could see. These were cheap and I only wanted them for a costume, not everyday wear. They worked for that."
3.0,"Cute romper, though not for little girls with long legs. Be sure to hand wash as recommended. We used the hand wash cycle on the washer - the seams unraveled and the straps ripped from the seams."
3.0,"I ordered a medium and at 5' 7&#34; 130 pounds, this dress was too big. The hip area was especially large and awkward. It seems disproportional."
3.0,"The dress was definitely beautiful, but was worn by someone else because it smelled of bad body odor.  I am going to have to take it to the cleaners to see what they can do."
3.0,Just your everyday cheap old school aviators. Could be a little bigger frame wise since i have a large head but still fit comfortably.
3.0,Looks very professional but the zipper doesn’t stay up. The material is very soft but grabs to leggings.
3.0,Nice and small umbrella but I returned it because I didn’t like the handle. It was short and stubby and felt like I couldn’t get my hand around it properly so I returned it and bought a Tote brand instead.
3.0,Good quality shirt but the sleeves were too short.
3.0,"I bought these for my daughter and her friend, they like these and they're cute for preteens."
3.0,I sized down as suggested and they fit great!  I have a hard time finding patterned jeans and was excited for these.  First wear was great.  But then after the wash… these are fur magnets.  I tried laundering with dryer sheets and fur catchers to no avail.  I have to brush them down every time.  I kept them because I do like how they look but if you’re like me and want low-effort laundry I would skip these.
3.0,The material feels like umbrella fabric and it was not a very flattering fit.
3.0,"It's ok.  A bit small but look ok on my ears.  The posts are perfect but the pearls look a little plastic to me.  I'm not sure I want to purchase  anything further from Cat Eye.  However, to be fair, at the price that I purchased this item,  I should not expect much.  May be a good present for kids."
3.0,"Was a present for my daughter - she actually hasn't used yet but it is WAY short (she is 5'8"") and came way above her knees.  So if you are on the taller side I would recommend looking at something else.  She did say she like the texture of it though.  I told her to donate and I will look for one that actually will at least go to her knees."
3.0,These are so cute but run really small!
3.0,Decent nose ring. Fair price.
3.0,"Great way to quickly find your bag after a flight in a sea of black bags.<br /><br />I did get a crack in the case after 3 flights, that is why it lost 2 stars.<br />The warranty that came with it is why it didn't lose more stars, they were willing to give me a replacement since it was still within warranty."
3.0,"I can wear a medium to large in sweaters, I ordered 2 Xl because I don’t like things too tight and I think sports bras can run tight. However this was super tight! The gray one was better, as was a bit bigger. Someone mentioned order a size up. So I thought I was safe ordering one up. Nope!  Disappointing. Quality made though, great price. Most likely will only keep as gray one is tolerable."
3.0,Cute but the strings are pretty long and it looks really fake haha
3.0,"I got these for work and was super excited to get them. First impressions were that I liked the hat it fit nicely, but disappointed by the fact that I would have to sew on the buttons to attach masks and weren’t already. Besides the buttons not being on I like them"
3.0,"These look nice, but not very comfortable and short in the back part.  My heal kind of hangs off but my toes not all the way to the top."
3.0,"Nice and warm very comfortable,  just dont like way look on me ?? But works great in winter cold days its windy out anyway"
3.0,Arms are narrow cut
3.0,Washed few times. Nice material but little tight fitting.. Order one size higher.
3.0,"This is the perfect bag for work travel and commuting. It's just the right size for my Macbook Air, it is lightweight, the shoulder drop is a just-right length, the pockets are many and varied, and it looks durable yet sophisticated. There's just one catch. The brown color is less of a traditional cognac and more of an orange-light brown. Because of that slight difference in shade of brown, I'm not sure if I can match this bag with my current shoes, belts, etc. I added a side by side pic of other items I already own so you can see the color difference. Someone also mentioned the leather is a bit on the shiny side, which it is. It is very pretty but I am debating whether to send it back. Maybe black is my perfect match???"
3.0,Cute sandals but after two hours of wear the pink paint is coming off the strap and it’s a bit of a letdown. Maybe the other colors hold up better but this pink paint is flaking off easily. Disappointed for sure.<br /><br />UPDATE - the company was really great about responding to my review and making sure I was satisfied once again with my purchase. I really appreciate the customer service and the care they showed for making their customers happy. Will keep an eye out for other products from this company for future purchase.
3.0,These are easy to use masks and they are washable which helps. They seem to allow a lot of air flow around the mask
3.0,Very disappointed that this very expensive north face jacket is not water proof or even water resistant. Light London rain did it in.
3.0,"Not sure how to dry this out after use. No directions on packaging. Wish I would have purchased blue or red, not such a light color!"
3.0,Hard to insert
3.0,It’s fine and will do but was hoping for something better.
3.0,"Dress fits as expected, very well made and great material."
3.0,Kind of felt like a night gown
3.0,My boobs are not at my waist. I am 5 ft and the dip in the neck area went below my breast line. After some sewing I was able to get it at a decent fit.
3.0,"The band is good looking,but I have a small wrist so that makes the band to long for my wrist."
3.0,"Great for holding a kitten of a sphinx cat like mine, but it’s THIN fabric on you - nice thick pocket for kitty"
3.0,These worked. Smell weird if it gets wet.
3.0,Was kind of taken aback when I saw the bright white neck next to all of the mostly dark colored stripes.  I wonder why they didn't make the neck from one of the stripe colors?
3.0,"I liked the socks, very cute and comfortable. However, I only received 3 pairs of the 6 pairs that were ordered. I reached out to the seller twice, they never responded. Amazon refunded half my money, which I felt was fair."
3.0,It IS costume jewelry after all but its pretty
3.0,"I bought these for after a c section and they did not work. The band is too tight and uncomfortable around a postpartum belly. I also got my normal size and they were too small. I’m 5 weeks postpartum and still can’t fit in them. The actual material is pretty soft, definitely not very stretchy though.<br /><br />Edited to add: the company reached out to me and was very nice and made it right. I don’t recommend the underwear to postpartum moms but I will say that I am impressed with their response and feel better about my overall experience with them."
3.0,"These glasses are interesting to look at and very light weight - the thing that gives them 3 stars only is the fact that they let the sun in from the sides - top and bottom of the frames - My regular sunglasses block the sun from the sides well, but these sit off of my face in such a way that the sun shines in around the frames -<br /><br />The frames are light weight and interesting to look at with the cut outs, but they stick out on the sides away from my face and they do not block the sun - the reason I wear sunglasses in the 1st place - I took these with me in vacation, but they do not block the sun from my eyes.<br /><br />These sunglasses are fun to look at and light to wear that they feel like nothing on your face, but the sun gets around the frames = this could be from the shape of my face -"
3.0,"Very... very small for the size, the material is ok."
3.0,Doesn't even spark much less start a fire but they are a nice strong buckle.
3.0,Rugged work pants that fit just right
3.0,"I own a number of pieces of Fjallraven technical clothing and this is the only one that has left me disappointed.  It's barely water-resistant, it has a plastic feel to it (in a bad way), and it does not seem to be very wind resistant either.  I tested this during a Halloween light rain and I was drenched inside and out.  I will say this, it looks nice, but it's not trail-worthy.  I would stick to the G1000 jackets.  The Anorak is the most versatile technical softshell you will find."
3.0,Slippers were to narrow.
3.0,The two  I got was way hard to attached at first. but now I've gotten the hang of it.  I have had no  problems since  getting these  bands. great fit especially since I have a large wrist (8in)
3.0,Not as nice as they look in the picture. Stretchy and a nice maroon color. The fit was alright. I think the buttons draw more attention to wrong areas.
3.0,"This watch came without a manual.  With 8 functions, a manual is necessary.  Please email or mail me a copy of the manual"
3.0,Flimsy and were bent - but we only needed them for one night.
3.0,"I ordered the colored variety but only got silver. I don't mind too much but a but peeved that they didn't send what I ordered. Other than that, they look and feel fine."
3.0,"I had a ten dollar gift card so I decided to buy these. Very uncomfortable to pull the whole thing through my ears. I had so many compliments on them. But a week after I bought them, the needle part completely separted from the chain part!! Unwearable anymore."
3.0,"I was hoping for a creamy white - as the description says, but got more of a golden brown. Asked the buyer about this and they said some mis-coloration is normal from the photo. They offered a rebate which was nice. I kept the product b/c it's a nice soft fabric, and I'm hoping it will work on the project I need.<br /><br />Still wish is was more white...but overall, it's a nice scarf."
3.0,Cuteness 5/5 - only in pictures.<br />Quality 3/5 - Fabric is transparent.<br />I'd have to say after washing its probably only good for 5 times wear. Walmart fabric quality is probably better. 😔
3.0,"After the first couple days I've had it, the one line with the birds Broke but I guess that's what you get for something this cheap."
3.0,"Super squished and missing insert. Shoes look and feel more like slippers. But that's not even that bad, they're missing the show insert on the bottom of one shoe!!!"
3.0,Too short but it looks nice. Thanks
3.0,"I bought it for my 15 yr old, she loves it"
3.0,"This product looks very well done and very beautiful. I'd be 100% satisfied if it wasn't slightly smaller than the average. So if you buy this product, make sure to order a greater size than what you wear."
3.0,A little small but the color is perfect.
3.0,Runs small. The dark Grey is very thick and feels like polyester. The side split goes 1/2 way up leaving open gap even when tied.  Not flattering at all. :(
3.0,"the cut and sdesign is very flattering, I really think it is dynomite quality for the price....but i bought an XXXL and it is still too small. Im 5'6 and 155 lbs and It it tiny, wont even connect in front!!"
3.0,Looks OK but a bit small.
3.0,They are soo cure! But.... they are not true to size order 2 sizes up!! So sad i loved these!
3.0,"Liked the style and decor of this hat. Unfortunately, it wouldn't fit onto my head past a 1/2 inch, or so. Had to return. First breeze would have carried it off."
3.0,It is a beautiful jacket. It does run very small however.  I live in Minnesota so I got the jacket with the intention to wear it over a couple layers of clothing. To do that I ordered it two sizes larger than what I would normally get. Sadly even just to try it on without a lot of layers the jacket was too small. The shoulders were to tight and the jacket did not reach around me to button. I am in the process of returning it to get a larger size. I love this jacket the meterial is soft and it’s got a lot of character in it. Unfortunately the sizing it just very small.
3.0,"The bottoms were too small and the top was too big. I made the top work, though. I just wear it with a different bottom ."
3.0,"It's not PU leather, but it's not top quality leather either. The leather is soft, but thin, and it has a coating. However, it's relatively well made -- stitching is clean, and the bag keeps its shape when set down. The style is retro yet trendy and versatile. The crossbody strap is way too long for petites, even if you use the last hole in the strap. I had to punch more holes with a leather puncher, cut about seven inches off the tip, and finish the cut part with thread, glue, and a black Sharpie. It comes with a good number of pockets for my purposes, but I would've liked a softer lining. It's a small bag, but I got this just for my essentials and that's enough. I'm not thrilled with the gold line in the logo. It's tacky and the embossed company name would've sufficed. It's a good bag with a designer look. Just don't expect designer quality."
3.0,Top almost too big while the waist on this color is kind of tight.
3.0,"I bought this bracelet for my mom, she didn't like it. I thought it's cute."
3.0,"Run small , digs in my cooch and the fabric stinks like chemicals . I don't wear these now"
3.0,It runs VERY small I had to return it.
3.0,It feels like I am wearing a nightgown.
3.0,I liked them a lot. Didn’t love them but I like them. I guess I wasn’t expecting them to be so sheer. But they get they job done. Over all they are good.
3.0,Good material fits perfectly !
3.0,the diamonds are falling out where it hits the counter
3.0,Was not pink metallic.  Delivered silver metal.  Not what I wanted.  Looks too cheap with silver metal
3.0,Horsehead came off the first time I used it.<br />I epoxied it back on. Otherwise good.
3.0,"Ok bag with some design flaws.  It looks better than it is functional.  First, the strap is designed in a such a way that after you shorten it, there is no good way to manage the slack.  I had to use a paper clip to secure the slack to the strap loops.  Also, there are way too many flaps on the inside that makes it hard to put things in the bag because they tend to snag stuff.  I use it for my boxing equipment and putting my gloves in the bag takes some finagling.  Overall good value for a item.  To me it's a disposable item."
3.0,Charm rusted after a few hand washes.
3.0,I bought this shirt as 2xl because my husband wears that size and when he wore it he felt it tight on him and that's his size current size. So if you want to purchase this shirt get it a bit bigger and check to see if its good he loves the design but he can't wear it.
3.0,A little to Big for my wrist and turned colors
3.0,"Had potential. Not shiny, duller than dull. I wear it every day, never received one compliment. Other jade I always receive compliments."
3.0,"This small astronaut is cool. But the material feels cheap, sort of like a thin nylon. It came wrinkled. And it took about 2 weeks 1/2 to come in. It’s imported from China."
3.0,"First one I ordered came with a fluffy pillow that I really liked, I ordered a second one it just came, in a hard box with no pillow it smells like a weird odor and the bracelet came slightly broken so can't really use it. Very disappointed wasn't expecting quality to go down like this!!! ☹️"
3.0,"This is not the worst dress I have ever worn, but I turned right around and got rid of it. It was baggy under my arm pits and instead of hitting me on the smallest part of my waist, the lace stopped right under my boobs. I would not recommend."
3.0,"I like the leggings, but for some reason they keep falling ( not too much but enough to annoy me..) . I prefer Nike's leggings for better fit."
3.0,"Seem like a good bra, however, I ordered according to size chart and fit too small, and I had to return.  I advise ordering a few cup sizes up."
3.0,Fit snug on her. I got her the 12-14 and she's barely a size 12 normally and is very thin. It was good otherwise.
3.0,"Only 3 months ago I wore a size 6 at 119lbs. Somehow, I have ballooned to over 170 lbs and while working diligently to lose the weight, I thought I would try a shaper. I'm embarrassed to have to do this, but I'm also embarrassed that I gained almost 40lbs in less than 4 months....<br /><br />I'm 5'10.5 and 162lbs. After reading the majority of reviews, I ordered an XL. I almost killed myself trying to put it on! Seriously. I almost toppled right over into my glass coffee table.<br /><br />One leg in, okay. Both legs in and up to the shins, okay. As I attempted to pull it up my thighs and past my rear, I lost my balance. It's kinda hard to stand straight up when you've restricted your legs so tightly that you're knee knocked. I shimmied and I shook and pulled and turned until I finally had it around my stomach. It took about 10 minutes to get it on, if not more.<br /><br />It's extremely confining and certainly holds you in place; however, it's so tight, I'm afraid that I may never get it off again. In fact, I just meant to try it on, but I'm scared of risking injury by taking it off - I'm still wearing it three hours later! Heck, I may even sleep in it.... Who knows.<br /><br />I don't plan on keeping it. It was far too difficult to get on and, as it turns out, far too tight to try and take off.... That is, without risking bodily harm. I mean, there's no way it can be rolled down while sitting down and when standing - once your legs are bound together.... Where ever you land is anyone's guess."
3.0,"I love this! BUT, the fringe is shedding pretty bad, but I still really like it haha. Everything other than the shedding is perfect. I ordered it a large while I usually wear a medium because I wanted it to be oversized, and its perfect!"
3.0,Good product.  Met expectations.  Probably needed to buy another and stack them together.
3.0,"The ring runs small, size up!"
3.0,My cats played with it but it didn't float in the air as I had hoped because that makes my cat super excited. One cat was really excited the other you had to coax a bit more to play. It's okay if your cat isn't too picky about their toys' abilities.
3.0,Very heavy!!  Look good if you don't look at the back.
3.0,"I don't have a big head, but these glasses are a little tight. The hinges are also very stiff and the glasses leave marks on the bridge of my nose. Super cute and stylish, but they wear like dollar store glasses."
3.0,"This hat came folded up, UGH!!  I have books on it for the past couple of weeks so hope to take to the beach with me.  We will see."
3.0,Arms too short!
3.0,material heavy for warm weather
3.0,"These bands were huge, could not take off enough links to make it fit.  No issue with craftsmanship."
3.0,"It is a nice cosmetic necklace.  The price is cool, now I know I like the fashion and will spend a little extra on similar necklace with more quality."
3.0,Size way too small
3.0,"slightly larger than 20... didn't fit my watch, and the &#34;return window closed&#34; 7 days ago. :(  If I could exchange it, I'd be happier; it looks like a nice band."
3.0,"very cute styling, but way too small when it arrived."
3.0,"I like how they look, not sure about the fit i want to say they feel loose around the ankles. They are comfortable though."
3.0,"I chose this style of pjs, buying 2 pairs, rather than other styles of PajamaGram pjs, because it clearly stated in product description “drawstring, elastic waist”. My granddaughter is very tall, but with a tiny waist and needed the length but with the ability to cinch the waist. Other styles used language “faux drawstring” which is what these really were. Quality of pjs seem fine though."
3.0,"It is a cool looking watch, however it is very big, wide, and bulky.  I am not a small girl but this thing was huge on my wrist.  It needs some of the excess strap taken off. The band is very thick and rigid.  Hopefully I can cut some of the strap off and after wearing a while it may get softer."
3.0,"Good price, good buy!"
3.0,"Love the style, and sweater itself. However right arm was sewed crooked making it hard to put on. Sweater seem to have imperfections."
3.0,I love these they came fast and were absolutely perfect. So many compliments. But one of them chipped so quickly. Within the first 2 weeks the edge that is more so touching the inside of my lobe chipped. It's upsetting but still wearable. It's not that noticeable visually. But it feels not so great after a long day of work :/
3.0,It’s comfortable but the fabric is not great
3.0,"The belt is very cheap and can’t go through pant loops without taking it apart. These are quite thin so they can’t be worn in colder weather. Overall, they look really cool and my daughter does like them."
3.0,I ordered a larger size per the instructions from the seller. They barely fit and are tight.
3.0,"Instead of ,""I ♡ my soldier "" the charm said ""I love music""."
3.0,"Looks just like the picture advertised. Loved it only Downside is that It runs small .Got an XL im 5'3 about 180lbs it fit like a medium i usually wear a large. It's stretchy , soft material and comfortable even though it runs small. If I put my arms up or even if i zip up this romper i would get a camel toe . If the bottom half was a little longer It would be perfect."
3.0,Design is great but could do a better job with their fabrics. Cotton not too comfy and a bit itchy
3.0,It was pretty small...but for the price it was ok
3.0,Very thick fabric and the legs are more than one inch longer than the usual length for 32.
3.0,LOOKED MUCH BETTER ON THE MODEL
3.0,"This is an enormous shirt. .  I wanted this to be an oversized, light shirt for layering over a camisole in the summer, but it is so enormous it will not stay on without adjustment.  I took a tuck in the neck and back so that it would stay on my shoulders and I will have to adjust the front somehow.  All that said, the color and the fabric are really nice and I will be able to make it work for me.  I am 5'3&#34; and normally take a medium."
3.0,"It has a bendable band. It isn't shiny or natural looking! Dragonfly catches on EVERTHING! For a girl that hasn't ever come across anything &#34;Dragonfly&#34; and not immediately fall in love, it's very blah. I guess I got what I paid."
3.0,"Lightweight, long bill. Just what I wanted for fishing on my boat. Wishing I could get one in Grey!"
3.0,"It's ok as a tunic, but it's definitely short for a dress. I am a 34 ddd top and usually wear a medium. I ordered the large and it is snug. I can probably still wear with leggings."
3.0,The fabric is really stretchy and does not hold you in well. They are alright so I kept them but not what I expected for these type of shorts.
3.0,A bit pricey for the two. But really can't find it in stores where I shop.
3.0,"These gym shorts are of really high quality. They are decently breathable for the thick high quality design and look nice overall. They do have somewhat of an unusual fit since they flare out at the end which isn't the most flattering look in the world, but they are comfortable and fit nicely otherwise. I am 5'7"" and 140 lbs. and I went with small."
3.0,"It's an okay bag, but in my opinion, it is not large, and I would not classify it as a tote bag.  I can only fit about half the items<br />from my regular purse in it.  It appears to be pretty well made, although not genuine leather."
3.0,"Appears like a tactical military-grade shirt, but isn't. The elbow pads are in the wrong place, the velcro won't last more that 2 washes, and it is way too tight."
3.0,The print is really bad.  Blurry.  Only good thing is this is a comfy mask.
3.0,cord is not long enough to go over even a child's head.
3.0,"Very beautiful and light weight. However, It gets tangled easy"
3.0,"Fabric was not what I expected for what I needed it for.  It fit perfectly, but I have no need for it so will be returning it."
3.0,"Works well, the ends curl pretty harshly ruining the affect. All-in-all I would recommend if you don't care for the style too much."
3.0,It says size 17 but the neck looks and feels like it's 17.5.
3.0,"I really liked the way this dress looked and fit (for the most part). You must follow the size guide!!! For someone who is 5'10"", 200 lbs, and a 36DD, the XXL fit best (I normally wear a large, folks); however, the seam connecting the skirt and bodice didn't hit my body right. The seam hit under my chest an inch or two before reaching my body. If you look carefully, you will see it in the picture. It's not a big deal and the dress still looks nice, but I prefer to not emphasize how big my chest is with a seam running right across it. I planned to wear this to work, but I know I wouldn't be comfortable in it. If you have a C cup or smaller, I would recommend this dress for you."
3.0,Very disappointed when I opened box. It's not the same color. It's very flimsy.
3.0,It is as expected.
3.0,The band is stylish and appears well made. It is heavy but I'm sure it will be fine after I have several of the links removed to customize the fit.
3.0,"very small,was going to take 2 of the chain and make earrings to match necklace,instead gave 2 to great nieces and added 1 to ""charm bracelet""I made out of other mermaid""under the sea""charms,great price for a child's gift,for this price they would be cute in birthday swag bags"
3.0,I would like to return this sweater. It is too small.
3.0,"I bought this product because of the price.  I didn't have high expectations because of the material.  However, it looks very nice on.  The length is perfect to wear with leggings.  I only gave 3 stars because I had to cut loose strings off the sleeves."
3.0,"It's made with good fabric, it also makes me look elegant, and it is very versatil to where, it looks great with a blue jean and high heels."
3.0,Very disappointed that the item doesn't indicate where it was manufactured.  It is the law that it has to be indicated.  Will be returning it.
3.0,Cute as heck but if you are needing support for your chest you won't find it with this suit.
3.0,very comfy but cotton is thinner compared to the other brand that i bought in amazon too
3.0,"Love the design on these socks; however, one of them developed a hole after the 2nd or 3rd wear. They're not very expensive though, so the price is right !"
3.0,I returned this item the fit was crazy big
3.0,"could not see the other side, so it didn't work for me"
3.0,"Nice cut to the shirt. Does slim but the fabric is see through and due to the cut, difficult to layer well. Also the ad. said white but because of the type of fabric, it looks almost blueish or dirty white, not at all like the photo would lead you to believe. So somewhat dissappointing."
3.0,Nice and comfortable if you like boxers but the softness like  a comfy T shirt type of material
3.0,"Ok.........we bought these for out of the country travel.  They are secure and very sturdy.  The problem with them (if that's what you call it) is that when you fill out the information on the card and assemble these to your luggage, the only thing that displays is your name.  Pro:  Nobody has your phone number and/or address.  Con:  If you lose your luggage, is anyone going to know to disassemble your tag in order to find your contact information?  Help me out here.  Am I missing something?"
3.0,Warm sweater but made way too small. I wear a size small so I ordered a Medium because I saw these reviews. I need a large! Sleeves are short and sweater is a bit tight.
3.0,My kid loves them but the right one dies within an hour
3.0,Wanted to love this dress but it was very sheer (white) and the neckline was too high. I’m sure the darker colored dresses are just fine.
3.0,"I wanted to give it to an 11year old and it was much too big for her.  Otherwise, it was nice."
3.0,They look adorable on. My daughter however did easily pull off one of the bows the first time she wore them.
3.0,"I did not like the way it looked on me.  Neckline was too restricting and it was too long for me.  I am 5'2"" ordered a small.<br />Nice quality soft material."
3.0,This product was okay. The crosses themselves were messy (some of the ink leaked out onto the beads). In general it looked sloppy and it was uncomfortable to wear at times.
3.0,Runs small. I usually wear a small but ordered a medium. Nice cut but thin material.
3.0,"Pretty but weird sizing, bottom crunches in middle area, top loose !"
3.0,Cute enough for my costume
3.0,Snags very east
3.0,"This was overall a pretty nice body suit. It's holds you in and almost feels like it has a built in body shaper! The thing is the material<br />Is really strange, it feels like a swimsuit!"
3.0,Material felt strange and it didn’t fit well.  Disappointed.
3.0,Overall good shirt just to wide at the bottom.
3.0,"I'm a truck driver and am often in and out of the cab. I've used Saxx underwear for several years and they're the only brand of panties I wear. I am hoping to find a brand that continues it's support well after initially putting them on.<br /><br />These don't do it.<br /><br />I've cooked dinner, had dinner, and left the table. So, metaphorically, have my boys. However wonderfully comfortable this pair is, they don't fit the bill. Fwiw the boys are low hanging and large."
3.0,Left fuzzies everywhere! :(
3.0,"I bought the 2XL and I wear a &#34;street size&#34; 10 in jeans.  I guess when I lose some weight this will be good to try, but for now, it is too tight to even close it."
3.0,"They aren’t very glowy and the flare is bigger than expected, but good quality besides that."
3.0,The light switch and charging connection is slipping deeper down into the shoe. Not a good thing.
3.0,"This is such a pretty skirt, and very true to the photos. I bought the pink, which is a baby pink sparkley material underneath with a beige tulle overlay. I love the look of it. I wish they had sizes however. I am a usual size small/medium at 5'8&#34; and about 140, and while I could wear this skirt, it's pretty tight and uncomfortable--I can't imagine anyone bigger in the waist than me wearing it comfortably."
3.0,It was cute but not what I expected.... the heart was a little too small... you need a magnifying glass to see the letter on it... could of been a little bigger heart and letter on it..
3.0,The dress looks nothing like the photo. The material is cheap and it shows in the dress
3.0,"I liked up until the point it untied itself. I'll look into how to retie it.<br />It is as described. Very pretty. It also fit very comfortably on my wrist, there's also a way to adjust the length.<br />I am happy I bought it, I just wish I knew how to retie it."
3.0,"Very Nice and lightweight, ordered a xs in red, received the burgundy. May return it."
3.0,Stays on but it’s quite small on the cup
3.0,I thought they would be a little bigger
3.0,Nice and simple. ...thnks
3.0,"For me, these were not a keeper. Did return it, texture was soft but when wearing them seemed to be very loose. Loose clothes can be easy to wear also comfortable but these had a different way of wearing."
3.0,"Love the fabric and general cut, just wish it had a higher waist"
3.0,"I didn't really mind these tights at first. They fit really well and looked really classy, but after about 3 laundry loads, they started to slacken. It's a good thing I bought two. The extra one is now my back up, and I guess it will be gone in about 3 weeks too."
3.0,"Received this sweater today, thinner knit than I was hoping for, sleeves are very long and the shoulder seam feels weird,I ordered an XL but beware if you carry weight in your mid section as it barely fits. It will do for some work days but won't be enough for really cold days."
3.0,The cut goes all the way through from outside to inner. Looks really cheesy like one size fits all. $5 gold Eagle spins freely and will not tighten up. Screw is not jeweler grade and has missing threads. Good luck!
3.0,"I love how the bracelet looks although I am sad to say it came with one crack all the way through, I would recommend some sort of safety wrap so others dont have this happen as well."
3.0,Not as brightly colored as pictured. More muted. I was disappointed but will keep it anyways.
3.0,"Loved it until today.  This is a good minimal type wallet.  However, as you can see with the pictures, it is now in pieces.  All 6 screws came out at once this morning and we're all in my jeans pocket.  I'm disappointed, by that, because it is a good product, but I can't have the item that holds my credit cards, identification cards and money falling apart."
3.0,it started to fade and look bad on my girl a week after wearing it... she doesn't wear it any more.... very disappointed
3.0,"About a full size too small, the hoodie itself is a bit thin, but the material on the inside is comfortable"
3.0,no me gusto me quedo grande
3.0,"Dress is way too short to be worn as a dress (I'm only 5'5"") and the material is just meh. I will be keeping to wear as a tunic over leggings."
3.0,Pros: price was right and my daughter wanted this style locket. Packaging was OK and everything looked just like the picture.<br />Cons: The word spacing on the daddy's girl background just looks weird.
3.0,My big toes just don't like the feel. They feel too hard for my feet
3.0,"Items such as this are hard to purchase online because you can “see” the quality until it is in your hand. I was disappointed with this because it looked really cheap (like for a kids play costume), not something I’d want to wear to a fancy event. I intended to wear it as a piece of bling on an infinity dress but I returned it and instead opted to buy a bridal belt instead."
3.0,"I really like the tee but it is really small. Great color, fun design but it just does not fit."
3.0,"It is nicely made dress. The skirt part of the dress could use some improvement as far as the material goes.  The top and back shimmer area is made with strech material, so it feels comfortable when you zip it up. However, the size seemds to run small. We bought small, which according to the chart should fit size 4/6. But it is more like small size 4. Also, if you are gifted with small chest, the cup is going to hold whole lot of air. The color shown is very close to the true color. Overall,  I like the design since it is stylish yet modest, but I did not like the skirt material and the fitting."
3.0,"I wear a 46 Regular.  I couldn't even get my arm in the x-large.  Other than not fitting, I liked the look."
3.0,Looked better in photo
3.0,Too difficult for young child
3.0,"Smelled great and was cute, but the powder doesn’t last even 30 minutes and its easy to bust sadly."
3.0,Nice suit just wrong size. Definitely size up.<br />I’m usually a 12/14 but it fit more like a 8/10.<br />Suit material was thick bummer you couldn’t adjust the straps.
3.0,"I bought these pants in size Small, which has been the right size for me in the past with Dynama pants, but the size Small has big baggy hips and thighs.  I tried ordering size XS and the hips and thighs fit ok but the waist band is too tight to comfortably get over my hips; there's very little stretch in the waist band. Too bad. I really like that the pants are lined.  I am returning the size XS but will keep the size Small and just wear them baggy."
3.0,I gave them 3 stars only because the metal is cheap and not heavy as I expected it and some of the pearls have damaged surface. The metal has a rose orange gold color not a yellow color like real gold. The flowers are nicely executed and overall it has a nice look.
3.0,"Seemed like good quality, but sat really high on my noes. I have a long face so it didn't work for me. This resulted in a return. If it wasn't for that one feature I would have kept them"
3.0,It does not fit as it was described
3.0,I guess my legs are bigger than the average man. My pants fit like tights.
3.0,"Quality is good for the price, but it fits really large wrists. My husband had to remove all the connectors and it's still pretty loose."
3.0,"Loved this top initially when I tried it on. I actually wore it today for the first time. It’s kind of tight on my boobs, but fit is otherwise good. I bent over to grab something off the bottom shelf of the fridge and the button in the back snapped off instantly, had it on less than 5min. Don’t wear if you’re going to be moving around a lot. I’m 5’4 120lbs and 34D fits my body really well but not enough room for my boobs, hence the snapping. Definitely not for girls with larger chests."
3.0,"These are ok. They are very thin, cheap cotton, but that's to be expected for the price. The colour ran in the top on the first wash so the background is very grey now. Size-wise, the 3T is a good fit for my 3.5 year old. Overall, I'm disappointed with them but my son loves them."
3.0,"It is a great product for the price I paid( $9 +$10 shipping), but is not the same quality like the one in the picture"
3.0,Run very tights
3.0,Those fit small. They are a “Chinese large”
3.0,"There's nothing to write home about these gloves. They are white, they are cheap, and just barely pass the ""are they gonna rip when I put them on"" test.<br /><br />They suit the purpose that they were purchased for (keeping oily finger prints off acrylic display cases) so I'm good to go. I'd recommend them for light duty wear once or twice and toss them. For sure not for bands or military/police/etc use. They're not even close to nice. Useful just not quality."
3.0,"It's made by the material that similar as stocking, nothing is like cotton or cotton/synthetic blend.<br />Photo info:<br />Wrist: 15cm<br />Upper arm: 27cm"
3.0,"It wasn't as long as the picture made it seem. It came right below the knee. The material was stiff, therefore it didn't lay the way I thought it would. Also it has elastic on each side of the waist band, which is not flattering."
3.0,"They look good, but the waistband is too stretchy and tends to slip down somewhat. Also the tags are incredibly uncomfortable so I had to cut them off."
3.0,"Beautiful, but the sizing is weird. I had to return it, unfortunately."
3.0,"theyre really nice, except order two sizes up not one"
3.0,the arms were loose and the neck is awkwardly cowled but not the way a cowl neck is supposed to be (and in the image it doesn't look like it is supposed to be cowl neck at all). Its ok for the price.
3.0,Junior size
3.0,"I don't like that the seams were not finished, seems like it might fall apart quickly, but I love the print"
3.0,It's cute my daughter loves it. The scarf is long enough to double wrap. The gloves are thin and one of the balls came off of the scarf on the first day I had to sew it back on.
3.0,Is ok as expected.
3.0,"Looks cute. Runs small. I usually wear size 5.5, ordered 6 and fit, a little tight."
3.0,"As warm and comfortable as they are, the metal loops to place them up with are cheap and come out/bend easily and are a pain to keep in the shoes"
3.0,"My daughter is a size 6 and this is a woman's 7. Her feet can't get in the boot. Otherwise seems to be good quality, although the neoprene isn't very stretchy."
3.0,"Cute but product is grey, not white like the photo"
3.0,"Cool concept, not the best support, the results are kind of droopy. Look for something with a better panel design around the buttocks to lift and smooth"
3.0,OK but they are very small and are clearly very cheaply made. They're OK as disposable glasses for the day. Wouldn't buy again.
3.0,The color of the hat in the picture isn't really accurate. I received a heather grey hat. It's still cute but not amazing quality. The material it's made from is not super soft and the hat is very large. Will be cute when my baby is a toddler but it will be a while before she can wear it.
3.0,"The quality of the coat is average, I bought it when it was on sale and wore it casually as a coat."
3.0,I’m about 5’6. I weight about 168 lbs. The fit was ok. The dress received appeared to be a cheaper version of picture advertised.
3.0,This dress is made with a Junior/Petite cut.  I am 5'5&#34; and pretty evenly proportioned and the waist was way too high for this to sit correctly.  I didn't care for the light weight/skimpy quality of the fabric of the skirt.  Otherwise the colors are as vibrant as pictured and the top is super cute.
3.0,really love warmth need to sew button on better so i don't have to do it for you.Other then that i love them
3.0,"I went by the size chart, but it was still too small. It is very nice though."
3.0,"The hat looks great, lights all work...but.. it is<br />not made of material with any stretch at all, wasn't large enough to fit our grandsons. These were needed for the ""Santa hat"" day at school and just didn't work for them. I will attempt to reconstruct them for next year. : ("
3.0,"They're really cute and look so nice, but they constantly fall out of my ears. So they're also very annoying because I have to keep vigilant whenever I wear them."
3.0,"Fit fine, but my wife returned it out of safety concerns."
3.0,It looks cheap in person and my daughter didn't like it all - and she loves everything ice skating.  Just doesn't look pretty - colors are dark in real life and not shimmery.
3.0,"I just received this purse in the mail. It’s beautiful, but the color is in no way purple.  It’s light to soft mid- blue. I wish I would have known that because I was specifically looking for a purple purse, and spent a lot of time making a decision on which one to buy.  I haven’t decided if I want to return it yet or not because it is so pretty.  Just extremely disappointed that it’s not actually purple."
3.0,"I loved how these look and felt. I got lots of compliments. Unfortunately, they broke just the second time I wore them - the two bottom tassels detached and fell on the floor while I was just standing, talking to someone. I'm considering ordering them again for their beauty, but am concerned about the quality."
3.0,I liked the look but it was small to fit. It also had one or two runs before I put it on.
3.0,Oh how I love IKEA bags in all shapes and sizes. I want everyone to be aware this is NOT the small size! It is the medium size! Happy ordering!
3.0,The color and style is really pretty but they run really small and are much more fitted style than I was expecting.
3.0,"Pro - Perfect size, Good Quality, looks great<br />Con - The face of the watch itself I was thinking was PINK however, I would call it more rose then pink. I am a gal who LOVES pink of all shades so I'm not complaining per say just doesn't look as WOW PINK as the picture"
3.0,It wasn't horrible but for some reason the chain was tied in a knot.
3.0,Leather is not of high quality as described. Looks decent but there are better options available.<br />Also size was incorrect. Would recommend order bigger size and cut accordingly.
3.0,"Cute dress, but definitely see through. Had to wear a slip underneath. I'm 5'3&#34;, 140lbs, 38-29-40, 32F bra, and I purchased a Medium. It fit well, but the armpit area gaped a little."
3.0,Update: after my review the company reached out to me and is sending me a new wristband for my watch plus another one that they chose for me. I am waiting for it too arrive but for the customer service being great I gave it one more star!!<br /><br />This wasn’t as nice in person as it looks online. Very cheap looking and bulky. The colors were not what I was expecting. Tried it on and took it off. Didn’t wear it more than to try it on.
3.0,"This fleece is good quality, but unfortunately the fit was uncomfortable. It is an athletic fit, and unfortunately that no longer describes my body."
3.0,"Nice shoe, but makes my feet sweat to much due to the plastic."
3.0,Las tallas son chicas. Recomiendo una talla mas
3.0,The print is beautiful. Fabric is light. The fit/cut is a bit boxy uptop did not hug my curves. I am also 5’’1 and felt like the length was off.
3.0,"So pretty, got so many compliments, but snagged on things and ended up falling off within the day"
3.0,Very nice but sizing is too small
3.0,fits more like a t-shirt and not like a dress
3.0,They came bent up and small for adults.
3.0,"Definitely more pinkish and brownish colors for the leaves.  Fabric feels nice, thicker,  durable material. Has a nice sheen to it and an added plus for the pockets.  I wasnt a big fan of the waist band though."
3.0,"im a size 14 and 5'11""<br />the dress wasnt as long as it looks in the pic. I was worried about crotch shots when sitting. I would order a size up next time It looked pretty and sparkley, just didnt fit great"
3.0,"Quite small, doesn’t really look like the one pictured."
3.0,"Pins look delicate, very pretty"
3.0,"I think I ordered a size too big, but waited too long to return. They do what’s expected, just know that if you’re like me and a DD it’s only gonna do what’s the rest of the strapless-lounge stuff does. That is what I bought them for though."
3.0,gets whetever sore after a bit of wearing.  and the black started coming off. Not a good representation of a nose ring but good for lip and ear.
3.0,This shirt runs small. Other than that it is a very nice shirt
3.0,"It is a very cool looking wallet and it is definitely built tough as nails and for that I am giving it three stars, but the unique nature of the wallet I received was so small it would not hold more than two credit cards.  The search for a slim wallet continues."
3.0,"It's a good product, people hear me very clear on this. The only thing is that the zipper inside stops the beanie from streaching. It will fit better on smaller heads."
3.0,"I would have to take a lot of the dress in to be able to wear it.  And, I could not return it."
3.0,"Mine weren't matte black, they were a gloss finish, but they're definitely a nice pair nice for $3 and some change"
3.0,When you wear it shrink from knees
3.0,Our baby is 1 and she has tiny feet not even 4 inches. Usually she’s 3-6 or 6-9 on size charts for shoes. After reading reviews and looking at the chart we went with the 6-9 they were a little big but were so cute. However the grips don’t work at all so our baby was sliding all over the place. For a walking baby these aren’t a good idea.
3.0,"I used these hoops for my ears, since my hair kept getting caught on other piercings.  Every time I brushed my hair they came apart.  I may have been using them differently, but they didn't help my needs."
3.0,so thin
3.0,"I ordered this thinking to have is as a nice occasion dress. When it arrived and I tried it on, it fit pretty well. The thing about it is that the material feels more like a house dress/nightgown than a dress to actually wear. The lining is white which looks odd when wearing it and the slit moves. Cute dress and color is nice but don't get if you want it to be dressy."
3.0,"Ordered these as a gift and was slightly disappointed. They look cute. But the backs were bent and they looked a little worn. But for the price compared to other places, they were the best deal. Perfect example of you get what you pay for."
3.0,PANTS ARE NOT A SIZE 10 AS ORDERED
3.0,"I initially ordered these shorts for myself. I wear 18s for jeans, so ordered the XL, which should have been my size according to the description. When they arrived, I could tell immediately that they run very small and there was no way I’d be able to wear them.<br /><br />Luckily my daughter wears a 10-12 for jeans, so I had her try them on. They are even snug on her! Luckily they have a lot of stretch to them, so she’s able to wear them, but they are form fitting and not as comfortable as other shorts she owns.<br /><br />Overall the shorts look nice so I think they would work well if you can get the right fit, but that will be challenging since they run so small."
3.0,"It looks great. I don't use it , my husband does, but I haven't been overly impressed with the quality. He is super careful with his things but the back zippered pouch, he had put his wallet in and it left an impression in the leather. Then one of the front pockets, the little strap that holds the buckle is already breaking. 😕"
3.0,"Great colors they were as expected. But poor quality on the durags, they’re pretty thin and has a long line in the middle."
3.0,Llego sin funcionar las luces de la zapatilla izquierda
3.0,Gold was very chap looking. Band was awkward and hard to secure.
3.0,"This is NOT one size fits all.  If you are under a size 8 it will git, the arms are a bit short too"
3.0,it's too small and does not permit to store a passport easily ...<br /><br />so that is not as useful as I intented to.
3.0,"nice for the price, but doesn't hang quite as nicely as pictured."
3.0,"It's ok at best, nothing special"
3.0,"I'm 5'6 130 lbs and it's slightly too loose on me. The quality is also not perfect, but overall good for the price."
3.0,"The ring came separated, apparently the attachment pin broke. Since it's from Singapore and will cost me more to return/exchange it, I will try to wear it although the two-rings now look like one ring because of the broken pin.<br /><br />It's still pretty good tho for a $4ish ring."
3.0,"Pretty ok shoes, but the lace system needs an upgrade so they will stay one a bit better. It would be 5 stars when the lace system is upgraded."
3.0,"I love the look of this pendant, but the chain is much too long and it cannot be adjusted."
3.0,"When I pulled these out of the package I was a little alarmed that the “heel” was made about halfway up the sock—but wearing them it isn’t a big bulging mess so I’ll forgive it (see photos, it’s just above my Achilles’ tendon).  What I’m not thrilled about is that I am 6’ tall and these are not knee socks like pictured, if you were to judge by where the heel cup was — this is built to be a short crew sock. On me it comes to mid calf which is not a flattering cut, nor will it stay pulled up at that height.  Reading the reviews now I see that the size and fit of these things are all over the board.<br />I’ll keep them, but I initially wanted them for running in cold weather paired with shorts, probably the only marathoning I’ll be able to do in them is Netflixin’.<br />Pro: they’re soft and the design is spot on.  If you’re a tiny 5’4” girl they’ll probably fit you just right (except the heel cup which will be on your calf)"
3.0,Don't fit around your ears like 3 centimeters to wide look kool though
3.0,Really cute dainty piece. Though it did turn my skin green after the third time worn.
3.0,"The product description is not just mis-leading, but it's WRONG!  Even the package it came in claims that it has 5 pages of double sided windows for a total of 10 'windows'.  It actually only has 4 pages and 8 'windows'.  The fifth tab is not a window at all, but the interlacing tab that holds the windows into your wallet - it has no slot to put anything into.<br /><br />Since the sleeves I'm replacing in my wallet has five pages, I was looking for a direct replacement.  This one is lacking.<br /><br />Since I haven't used it yet, I can't speak for the quality of the sheets or how well they hold up, but they appear to be acceptable and typical of others that I've purchased from brick stores."
3.0,Too stiff and bulky with credit cards.
3.0,I Thought I ordered one pair of the Large night glasses and instead I got the 2 pair of clip ons<br />They are ok but the regular large pair are much better
3.0,"[[ASIN:B01DNSZCR6 Marolaya Womens Plain Sleeveless Strappy Swing Dress]]<br />I'm only 5'6&#34; and this is NOT a dress unless you want your hoo-hah hanging out. Where it Vs at the top of the skirt, the top of the lace hits right at the bottom of the hoo-hah.. meaning &#34;YOU CAN SEE ALL!!&#34; These models must be about 5'2&#34; for it to hit them like that. I can wear as a top, but I needed some dresses. It is cute, but disappointed at &#34;dress&#34;"
3.0,Smaller than i thought it would be. At first I could hardly fit my cards in there. It's okay now.
3.0,Sleeves were small for the size
3.0,"These are fancy and formal.  I do like them, although one of the studs is missing a small pave stone.  That's ok, as I use these with other stud earrings. (Have to, as the pear studs don't match with the missing little stone)."
3.0,It fits good my only issue is the bust area.  Not everyone has the bust size in a high position.  I did take the foam cups out and it helped a bit but it would have been better if there where no seems &#34;where the bust should be&#34;.
3.0,"These are definitely not &#34;luxurious&#34; gloves, but they are definitely pretty good for the price.  I would be pissed if I paid the original $88, but at less than $30 they are definitely fairly priced.  They look a lot nicer than they are, so they are good for looking somewhat formal on a budget"
3.0,Not warm at all but great for florida Christmas
3.0,To short in the back to wear with leggings unless you don't mind your bottom showing
3.0,"Pretty colors, decent fit. Hard to find a reasonably priced 36 DD in the stores so I was happy to find these at such a good price and with a decent fit.One reviewer noted a difference in sizing in the bras she received; all the bras in my package were a consistent fit.  I bought these mostly because I wanted color coordinated straps and backs for camis, tanks and tops with cut-outs. I was worried the lace would be uncomfortable and scratchy but it is soft.  These were a bargain.  The reasons these did not get five stars: the fit is not perfect and the colored lace overlays the beige-ish padding giving the cup a sort of two toned look and making it appear as though the lace is directly over your flesh.  Not a problem really (although it diminishes the pretty factor) except for the white bra - you can see the two tone effect when you wear it with a white shirt."
3.0,"This was okay for me. The fit was a little off for me. I think it is going to depend on your body type. I usually buy dresses in this size, and most of the time, they work. This one was a bit right on the waist, but was pretty loose on the top. So it kind of looked okay. The fabric was light and thin. It did seem well made. The pockets were cute, but the problem is that it made the skirt a little fuller, and this was not very flattering for me. So for me, it just didn't work. I think if you have a different body shape it may.  btw I am 5'1 and 135lbs"
3.0,"Even though the dimensions were given in the description, it was not as delicate as I imagined it would be. The glass was much thicker and not very delicate. Overall, it would be better for an adult and not for a child as I had hoped."
3.0,"A seem split in the glove the first time my wife wore it.  I sewed it up and it works fine.  she uses it to signal truns for me from the back of my motorcycle.  It is a great prop for a costume, which is why one would by it anyway and it is a good buy at, I think I paid, $5.99, less than 10 bucks with shipping."
3.0,"The shoes were super cute and fit my 7yr old son just fine. He got them for Christmas and loved them. However, the second time he wore them they ripped. They were practically brand new. I don’t think the brand typically make products of poor quality so I’d have to say this pair was defective...I don’t know."
3.0,"My rating is based on the band.  Sometimes is opens, sometimes not, plus was unable to remove links."
3.0,Fits snug at the bottom.It is shown loose not fitted
3.0,They come undone very easily
3.0,This ring looks good. And it is a size 8.But it feels like a size 7.
3.0,"The only problem was the letters where not white as the picture showed, Its like gray"
3.0,not small around the head its just not very deep. but its still the division. my trophy for getting in the top 8% on skill kills on the leaderboard.
3.0,"There is no lume on the hands as advertised.<br />The bezel is cheaply painted, and rotates fairly easily.<br />The cyclops over the date is hot garbage. You can only read the date when directly overhead b/c of this.<br />The holes in the lugs are also drilled real close to the case, so replacing the band with a NATO-style strap will be difficult. I had to force the spring bars down on a NATO strap, rather than just weaving it through like normal.<br />They should call this a &#34;dive-inspired&#34; watch, because it's not very functional. It's pretty apparent the designer was told to just make the thing look sporty, with a budget of whatever spare change was found under the reception desk's couch cushions that day.<br /><br />The kinetic quartz movement is by Seiko, and it's been pretty reliable. The only drawback is like the Seiko 5 series, there is no manual winding with the crown. You have to shake the watch to get it started. On a full charge, you'll get about 2 day's worth of battery backup time. That being said, paying $50 was a tremendous value--most watches carrying a Seiko Kinetic go for about $100.<br /><br />Given the garbage design elements, I'd recommend this watch to someone who wants to add a kinetic quartz to their collection at a low price; or for someone who wants a sporty-looking watch they won't feel bad about banging up.<br /><br />I originally would have given this a 1 star because it's so poorly designed, but it's grown on me since I got it. It's a lot like a cheap looking car that got its racing stripe stickers, spoiler, stick-on side engine vents, stick-on window tint, and fuzzy dice from Walmart. Sure it's ugly af, but then you check under the hood and realize it's got something special underneath."
3.0,"It fit great before washing.<br />It shrinks up a lot when washed. It’s too short in length now. I would definitely have liked  it to stay longer.<br />(Washed cold, dried on low)"
3.0,"I am 5 ft 6 in and thin, and the length came to the middle of my thighs.  I purchased it because in the picture it goes down to the models knees I don't know what size she is but I'm pretty average and thinner than most and I couldn't even stretch it to my knees."
3.0,"I love this style of mask, but these are quite small for a full grown adult woman. The neoprene like material stays away from the face, but it would stay on better and look nicer if it were just a smidge bigger"
3.0,I was disappointed in this top. The lower portion did not pull to the side. The 3 buttons where just attached on side seam. Will wear after removing stupid buttons.
3.0,it doesn’t look like the picture
3.0,"The quality and design are good, but it fits tighter than I would usually pick for a shirt to wear under a suit jacket."
3.0,"Everything I have is more flat than round, like a wallet, my phone, keys, passport etc so every items needs more of a flat space rather than a wide space which ended up making this model a bit less functional than the other model with the flap top. Also, the metal part of the clip of the strap was jammed so I couldn’t attach it to the bag."
3.0,Very cute but very stiff & uncomfortable
3.0,The sizes run small and the fabric is like an Under Armor type of shirt.
3.0,Odd fit. Torn between somewhat large and somewhat small. Legs are very long and waist is pretty tight.  My daughter is a very tall 2  90th percentile for height but 65th for weight so she's a pretty slender kid. She's got long legs but these bunch down at the ankles and they leave an imprint on her waist. Unfortunately not many options for ballet tights for the toddler set.
3.0,"Very disappointing. In the photo you can't see that this is a one-sided charm. Of course I wanted a completely 3-dimentional charm. It is a pretty horse, though (as you can see.)"
3.0,"I ordered my normal size but this dress was WAY too small, couldn’t e en pull it up over my hips. I’m an XL so hopefully the XXL will be a better fit. The dress is beautiful though"
3.0,"Too small and tight, unable to get it on my foot."
3.0,HUGE lenses. Would be cute if they were smaller
3.0,Love the mug- sadly the letters have started to wash away. I've only had it a few weeks. :(
3.0,"For ladies that are 2x ..fyi.. they are a bit see through so u would have to use dark shorts or something to cover up the see through, plus they feel like they run a bit small."
3.0,Fit great. Great color. Look good.<br />Wear down super quickly and are low quality! I will need to replace them very soon (and I'm probably already overdue)
3.0,The sleeves aren’t bad. The material over the hands degraded quicker than I would have hoped.
3.0,"I really like the delicate feel to this parasol and would call it a umbrella more than anything since that's what it really is. On the part of both umbrellas where you press the button to close and open it, there is a very sharp edge that I cut my finger on and had to sand it down a bit so it was safer. Still hesistant because was like a needle prick. Cute design though, fix the sharp edge and  I would of given it a 5."
3.0,"Got this for a Halloween costume.  Very pretty but a little scratchy and the ribbons kept slipping out of the bow, so I had to keep fixing it.  Still neat though."
3.0,"When I received this shoulder necklace it came broken. It was too much trouble to fix it myself, so I returned it for another one. That one came broken as well, but luckily it was an easy fix. It was an inexpensive option compared to other bridal shoulder necklaces out there, so I was happy with what I got for the price. However, it’s a bit small to sit on my shoulders, so I have to add rhinestones/pearls to elongate it."
3.0,"I love PattyBoutik clothing, but this particular sweater is a bit shorter than the picture indicates.  I love the feel of the sweater and the color, but I don't like wearing it with leggings as it does not provide enough coverage."
3.0,So I bought two of these. One leaks really bad.  Love the one that doesn't though.
3.0,To tight.  Thin material and wrinkles easily.
3.0,The chest area is much too small. I wear a 38 DDD and this did not even come close to buttoning.
3.0,Only the lenses are oversized. Fit very tight on large heads.
3.0,They do not stay hooked on the upper earlobe like I’d prefer but cute
3.0,Muy bonito aunque más pequeño de lo que se ve
3.0,Fabric isnt very soft and has a weird smell even after washed.
3.0,"Way too big. Fast shipping, nice quality.  I returned it the day it came in bc it was so big.....also, it's hand wash only. Who has time for that?"
3.0,it's a really cute necklace.  up against clothing it looks really nice.
3.0,"The fit is a little tight on my mid 90's DW-5600, but overall it is worth the money.<br /><br />One tip before you purchase: attempt to remove the 4 screws that mount the shell to the case. One of my screws broke during removal. If more had broken, this purchase would have been for naught!"
3.0,I just received it.  It looks ok but I have not used it yet so I really cannot review it
3.0,"I ordered according to the directions and these would not even come close to fitting. Definitely not plus sized. Also they were not the color that I had selected. However, had they fit, I think that they would have been great as they were a nice material and cute."
3.0,I really like the shirt except for it being a little snugger at the hip line than I would prefer. However it fits well enough to keep and I really like the length and pattern.
3.0,It ran huge and it turns out because I got an Xl instead of a large even than I feel i should’ve ordered my normal size and not sized up to a large. Xl was HUGE on me. It was super cute I ordered another one in size medium hopefully I get my normal size shipped correctly!
3.0,Sent two different sized socks.
3.0,Everything was great except it's see through sheer. Have to wear under clothes. More like laungerie than dress to wear out somewhere.
3.0,"The pocket squares are large and  a nice array of vibrant colors. My only complaint is that the box that they were in arrived open and used by a previous buyer. We know that Amazon recycles previously purchased items and charge you full price. The surprise was that there was a birthday card inside that was addressed to a ""Chris"". It even had an extra note on the card and signed by the person giving the card. Now these pocket squares was a gift for my husband, can you imagine the look on his face & mine when he looked inside the box and found a birthday card addressed to someone else!. AMAZON, do better with quality control!!!!!! 3 stars for poor quality controll"
3.0,"Unfortunately, I didn't confirm the size of these before ordering. I was wanting them for Tshirt clips. They are too small for that. Might work fine for a scarf. I sent them back."
3.0,"So wanted to love this bag, but the handle kept breaking making the bag unusable."
3.0,Ordered larger size based on recommendation of other reviewers. They are too big- wished I had ordered “true to fit”
3.0,"I am reasonably satisfied but the straw brim is not strong enough to carry the weight of the plastic visor, so it flops. The straw needs some stiffener applying, to make it stronger."
3.0,"The shorts are comfortable, not see through, good for working out. However, the stitching is terrible. The seams are uneven, unfinished/string was hanging from several seams etc. these work well for home workouts, possibly would wear them to a gym but unlikely. Definitely only worth the few dollars I spent on them on sale."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:7f8135c9b165f1e94e547f93152a376f]] Love the dress, arms are too small"
3.0,"I absolutely love the feel of these leggings! The material is so soft, stretchy, and form fitting but not compressing at all. They are so comfortable to work out in and breathable. I'm obsessed! The length is also perfect for my taste (it stops right at the ankle so not too long and not too short) and the contour line on the butt hits nicely. I am 5'6"" and 118 lbs and ordered a small in the steel blue marl color. My only complaint is that the waist is too big!! This is a huge drawback for me since I always wear crop tops with my leggings to the gym and it looks so awkward. I could wear a shirt that falls over the waist or fold them down but I don't like the look of that plus it just unfolds. I ended up just tying a sweater around my waist (which I always do on leg day anyways) so that hid the huge waist but I would like to wear them without doing that. I tried throwing them in the wash to see if they would shrink around the waist a little but no luck. I just ordered an extra small to see if that would fit the waist a little tighter. I'm hoping the rest of the legging still fits just as nice since they are very stretchy and form fitting."
3.0,"I didnt notice before i got this as a gift for someone, how small it is.<br />Beware it is tiny"
3.0,Fit is great.  The quality is bad.  You get what you paid for.  The thread is already coming a part.
3.0,Fit alright but the material was too thin to be flattering
3.0,"They wear really well, except for 1 of the 3 pairs. After 1 day of wearing, the capris had weird holes begin appearing in them (at the calf, front of thigh). They were comfortable and the other 2 pairs are fine, so it's hit or miss if you'll get a pair you can trust. Be sure to inspect them closely before wearing."
3.0,"I have mixed feelings. It is pretty dang cute, but I feel like the skirt is too wide and the waist is a bit tight. I'll still wear it, but it's a bit more cheaply made than I would prefer."
3.0,Wish sections were smaller. But overall is okay. I will wear it.
3.0,Earrings look pretty but it doesn't long enough for my ear. Wish they little longer
3.0,Nice fit but kind of thin and see-thru
3.0,Material was poor quality. It did not fit well.
3.0,"Quality was great, fit was weird. I wear a 7.5 and they slipped on my heal and the toe box was quite large. Another lady in my office wears the same size and when I told her the sad story about needing to return these boots and what a great price they were she wanted to try them and maybe buy them from me. They slipped off her heal too as she walked in them."
3.0,It works fine.  Like the calendar feature.  Just didn't realize how BIG it was going to be.  Almost returned it but decided to keep it.  Personally I would prefer a smaller face.  Guess I didn't realize what &#34;boyfriend&#34; meant. It was the size of a mans watch and not a womans.
3.0,"These are larger than I expected. Normally it wouldn't bother me but my ears are pierced quite low. So these sort of just hang off my lobes a bit. But the posts are long in my opinion so not really good for a small person or younger. I like to sleep in my earrings, and these twisted at night and poked.<br />HOWEVER..the colors are nice for an inexpensive glass material.  So I am keeping them but not wearing them at night!"
3.0,Does not fit like my other Coofandy shirts in the same xxl size. Way too short. Will return this one
3.0,Very pretty but broke easily.
3.0,I expected a little better quality but they look great
3.0,Such a beautiful piece but easily broke. :(
3.0,not impressed
3.0,Love these! They are just a bit smaller than I expected
3.0,"The white and black tanks were form fitting and the appropriate size, but the grey one was substantially smaller and not form fitting at all. I ordered size large and being 6'3&#34; the white and black ones were perfect length."
3.0,"This jacket is very warm, however, it is already starting to look a bit cheap with little bits of fabric balling up on it."
3.0,Little bit bigger then expected. Really have only wore it once.
3.0,Sadly item is extremely see through. Nude undergarments a must.  Material is VERY thin so everything shows.
3.0,"It comes from China so takes very long to ship!!  Material was nice.  But the neck is weird.  The collar stands up so tall that it scratches and rubs chin...and I actually have a long neck.  Not sure whether to button it or leave some buttons undone, but both ways that outer layer is awkward.  Would not order again."
3.0,"i will buy others in other colors but white is a bit too thin -you can sort of see through it, not good for work, but will get others"
3.0,Cute and works as a good mask but a little too small and too long. It could do the same job 1/2 the length
3.0,IT'S OK. Not exactly what I was looking for.
3.0,After two washes (hang dry only) it has started to fall apart! I love the fit and design
3.0,It broke easily in one use
3.0,"I followed the seller’s size guidelines and they fit really well. These pants are very comfortable, nice stretch, I like the pockets, and you can’t see through them, but the stitching is awful and they’re not as thick as more expensive brands. Overall, they’re ok. I haven’t had them that long and have only worn them a handful of times for light hiking and doing stuff around the house. The stitching is already failing. The seams haven’t come apart, but I have a lot of loose threads and places where loops of threads have pulled up. They look like I’ve had them for years. The yoga pants I *have* had for a few years (much better quality) look newer than these do. They’re not too tight or anything like that, it’s just bad stitching like you normally find on cheap clothes."
3.0,"Cute, but ran way big which made it look matronly. Returned it."
3.0,"It's cute, but bend it VERY carefully,  because it is also easy to break."
3.0,Not very exciting.
3.0,I love how compact this is and that it holds so much. But after a month the strap broke
3.0,"Fast shipping.  I was excited to have a screen prorector along with my order.  Description for the case color says light green on the one I ordered, once recieved the description on the packaging says apple green, but the actual case is a bright neon yellow green.  Not what I expected and think the color is a little obnoxious.  So far, other than the color, I have no other complaints."
3.0,Walking was a big weird and they do run small
3.0,"Super cute dress but not the best fit.  I ordered a size small (5'3, approx 110 lbs) and the dress was rather short.  Also, the waist was quite large, I could have taken it in almost 6 inches.  Overall, it worked and was very cute but just not the most flattering"
3.0,"Very soft and nice-looking but material is cheap. They are NOT anti-skid/anti-slip. Started to look old after a couple uses (gently worn). My little one's feet would get sweaty after a short period. IMO, best to use when not walking yet."
3.0,"Compared to another brand belt I bought last year, this belt is only tight if I really stretch it out. It looks like the belt is too big. My waist is 37&#34;, this is a Medium."
3.0,"These Charter Club Fairisle Booties look cute and are warm and cosy. They should have been a winner but... they are more like a sock with a thick spongy sole without enough support around the foot, my feet rolled around in them and my heels tended to wind up beyond the sole and on the sock. I have bad hips and knees tho so I do have special needs."
3.0,The earrings are really cute but unfortunately they did not hang right. One of them was actually facing the wrong direction and I turned it around but it's still only hanging partly right and neither one of them is completely right. I probably won't wear them much for this reason.
3.0,The material is pretty but very scratchy.
3.0,"Cute outfit, but fades after one wash"
3.0,"I bought this blouse in black and  I liked it so much, I bought a second one in a different colors. Same size (L), but they do not fit the same. I'll have to return the second one i bought so I can size up to an XL."
3.0,They were too small<br />Nice quality shoe
3.0,I ordered a small and it’s a big baggy in the bust area... I’m a 36C so I’m surprised it’s a bit loose... the waist area is also loose... The material is the dress and the color is what caused me to keep it. I’ll make it work..
3.0,Nothing special...denim color is very faded
3.0,Loved the style and color but it was to small
3.0,These pants are great for what I was deciding about what I wanted them for. They fit true to size and were not see-through. I would recommend these shorts.
3.0,"Not sure what I expected, but it's a little cheap looking, the neck in front especially. I'll keep it to bum around the house in."
3.0,"Pretty shoes, but they run really small."
3.0,"It's possible that these socks are suitable to wear for sports, but do not buy these socks if you are looking for actual compression socks for swelling. As mentioned in some previous reviews, they are very thin."
3.0,The dislpay picture misrepresents the actual size. Its smaller than you think. But it will still serve the purpose I need.
3.0,I wish I had listened to the other reviews. The shirt is lovely but it is just too small in the bust. Might fit better for someone with a flatter chest?
3.0,"Kid didn't like at all, the style was much more casual than I expected"
3.0,This did not fit as expected. My suit coat measurements and their size chart are much different. Suit coat is consistent. Overall nice shirt and good value. But fits too large I’ll return and order a size down.
3.0,"I got 2 pairs of these for my daughters because I thought they were polarized. They are an ""Amazon Pick for kids polarized sunglasses""...... I'm super disappointed that they are not indeed polarized..... despite that they're nice but I could've got the same thing cheaper at dollar general...."
3.0,"I am happy with the bag, but it is not like the bag I ordered.  I ordered the one in the picture ...red with black handles.  The one I received is red with gold leather handles. I liked it enough to keep it, but it makes me nervous ordering on line if I am not going to get exactly what I order. I hope this is the only time this will happen."
3.0,It is very pretty and the patterns and colors are vivid and nice. It is however a little uncomfortable material that would not be very comfortable to sleep in.
3.0,I wear an 8.5 and ordered a nine for comforts sake. They're a bit tight. May be returning.
3.0,"The pajamas are beautiful and was exactly what I'd thought it would be... however, when you wash them they do shrink. The kids won't be able to fit their Christmas pajamas Christmas night, they are hilariously small after washing. Just kinda sucks I spent $50 on pajamas that they won't be able to wear."
3.0,"These are the style that my son wanted, just a little too big.  The 5 mm are perfect."
3.0,love the ombre.  Simply beautiful
3.0,"I ordered the Pink top, but it's actually orange. The material is some kind of shiny fabric. I didn't care for the shiny fabric at all. I returned the top."
3.0,"The shorts are good quality and a pretty red.  But, I ordered Gloria Vanderbilt denim shorts thinking it was the same thing but the fit is not flattering."
3.0,The size of this item runs small.  Order a size up.  There is no size chart to compare with so I thought I was order a size I normally order.
3.0,Cute style.  Too small.  Not loose and Flowy.  Will return would buy 2x if it were available
3.0,"super comfortable, but way too long for me.  I am 5'3"" and 115 and ordered size 6.  Tag says tall which I didn't order.  Wish they had a short.  Not sure if I will keep.  Would have to hem"
3.0,"not as black as pictures, more of a off purple Sharpie black"
3.0,"You sent the wrong unit with long sleeves who need in the water with long sleeves, a MORON must have sent this JUNK, I am too busy and tired to sent it Back"
3.0,Nice necklace. Wanted for Halloween but got here way after.
3.0,These are comfortable but are a little snug. I also got them in black which fit a little better. Go figure. I wear a 6 in shoes and normally have to get a small in slippers. I got the 6/7. The next size up I think would have been too big.  I've been wearing them for about a weak and hopefully they'll stretch out.
3.0,"It's comfortable yes, and very light. But mine ripped when I got it. Easy fix just inconvenient."
3.0,sent back was really big
3.0,"Shrunk in the washer, but good for the price"
3.0,"I ordered this on May 4th and it arrived June 1st, with Prime!<br />While I like the top, it is a bit of an odd fit. It slips down in the back and the front of the collar rises high. Almost like a choker. I am constantly adjusting it, which is a pain. It's a cute top, but the style makes it a bit of an irritation, too.<br />Too bad, because it really is cute."
3.0,Love this style/ colors but item ran much smaller than typical size
3.0,Comfortable jacket but the material and zipper feels cheap for the cost.  Can buy a comparable product for cheaper.
3.0,"Its ok.. Very small print I did not like, I wear it all the time its been months and has not tarnished."
3.0,Pretty but looks a little cheap
3.0,"I bought the leopard print (I say that because sometimes the print or color has different fabric content) and really hate the fabric.  It’s supposed to be viscose but it feels and looks like polyester.  It’s scratchy and lacks the silky feel of my other viscose pajamas.  The fit is wonderful, though, except I wish the shorts were 1-2 inches longer.  They need just a tiny bit more inseam on the plus sized for comfort.<br /><br />Ultimately, they’re just pajamas and look fine so I’ll keep them.  Just will not buy more and can’t recommend."
3.0,Order 2 sizes larger than you actually wear
3.0,Super cute vest with knitted pables on the side that you can't see.  Was a little too 'Grandma' for me.....Super bummed because every other aspect was exactly what I was looking for.....return was fast and easy.
3.0,Time will tell if this product is going to hold up.  Have been wearing Birkenstocks for decades and the sealant that I have always used in the past is very thick and clear.  This product looks more like Elmers glue and goes on quite a bit thinner so I used two coats.  Time will tell if it holds up
3.0,Nice looking and keep glare done.
3.0,"Its cute, but it broke two days after I bought it"
3.0,Watch was a very pretty color and looked really good. It was too heavy for me to wear at all and I sent it back.
3.0,Too small to fit anything.
3.0,These are a bit small but decent for what I paid.
3.0,"My husband liked this dress on me but the material was just so thin and synthetic/rough feeling, I couldn’t keep it. If you’re ok with cheap polyester, then you shouldn’t have a problem."
3.0,"I think there is something wrong with the shape of my head because I can't find ANY headbands that will stay in place. These are fine at first, but towards the middle of my workout, they start slowly creeping up and then it looks like I'm wearing a crown. However, I think they are some of the best ones I've tried just because it takes time for them to slide up."
3.0,"I bought this for a gift, but the stem that adjusts the hands of the watch broke."
3.0,"The bracelets are beautiful and nicely made,  but huge!! There’s only a few I can wear that don’t fall off. Bummed because they are so pretty."
3.0,Nice sash but the pearls were more yellow toned than I expected
3.0,"Ordered this jumper in a small and it fit except for the straps on the sides. My torso is too small so the straps keep poking out. The shoulder straps are a bit loose as well. I would definitely do the same style pants without the straps and tube top. The pants on this jumper was the nicest/sexiest part! Unfortunately, I will return it but, hopefully I can find a pants only in that style."
3.0,"love this,....except the sleves gap out a bit too much!"
3.0,"The corduroy fabric is substantial and warm, but the skirt style would be most suited to a young girl whose figure was not yet fully developed. I returned this item."
3.0,It's nice. The kids liked it for their craft projects
3.0,"I liked the dress. It fit well, the material was nice and it wasn’t too thick or too thin. The bottom was a little too small for the skirt. Unfortunately, I wore the dress once and a seam ripped."
3.0,To big uncomfortable.  Thick hard to breathe.
3.0,small bags.  They fit a small seedless watermelon perfectly.
3.0,"Something about the design of this dress made me look outrageously wide in the hips (you can kind of tell based on how big the woman's hips look in the preview picture), and I'm somewhere between a size small to medium... not very big. I don't mean a &#34;round bottom&#34; look which is fine and I like, I mean wide when viewing from the front. It wasn't flattering. Returned it."
3.0,Like the material its nit thin but the split at the back is too high not for people with big but.
3.0,"If you want this to look good with your costume I'd recommend lots of starch and an iron.  The fabric is a little flimsy, but as far as value for the money it's ok."
3.0,This kit has a variety of nice looking toe rings but only a few fit and they hurt compaired to another type i bought earlier. They are a thicker metal with sharper rougher edges. If your are use to toe rings you probably wouldnt notice something like this. For the price i believe most buyers would be very happy.
3.0,I bought those for my phone cuz he likes those two characters
3.0,Chain broke within the first week of having it
3.0,Bought this as just a hospital bag for labor and although I did look at the measurements before buying I felt like it was still a bit too small. Color is slightly off and is a bit lighter than what the picture shows.
3.0,The dress was different colors than what was advertised. Didn't like as much as the picture but decided to keep as a beach cover-up. Fit was true to size.
3.0,Cute band but not suitable for someone this skinny/smaller wrists.
3.0,"The Baggallini Flip Phone Organizer is a good idea -ALMOST! The rip stop nylon makes for a very tough bag. A Good Thing.  I wanted something small just for the essentials and this bag turns out to be ALMOST right.  The pocket for the cell phone is too tight so my phone turns on with every tiny bump.  The change section can't hold more than 4 quarters.  The pen strap is a great idea but tell me - where am I going to find a pen that is less than 3"" long?  The pocket where I wanted to put my driver's license cuts off the corners making it really hard to zipper the bag closed. The tag states that it's also good for keys but I can't imagine where I'd fit any key larger than a virtual one in there.  Good ideas may come in small packages but this is just a tad too tight to be useful"
3.0,I bought this bracelet for my  grandaughter 15th birthday and she loves the charms but the bracelet is way too big and no way to make it fit better.
3.0,They are not as binding as others I’ve tried. Had they been long enough to reach the knees they would have worked better and probably have been less binding.
3.0,"the fit is a bit odd. it's ""reversible"" which I think is it's downfall. the material on top is too thick with it being two layers of stitching. I don't hate it... but I don't love it either."
3.0,"Floats around my torso and doesn't really cover anything.  Also oddly only came with padding on one side of the chest.  The material is already so thin that it is see thru when dry,  so I'm left with the option of ordering pads for the other side."
3.0,"Construction seems to be well done and materials are of good quality.  However, I got the lg/XL size and I can not quite get the ear flaps to completely cover my ears.  The bottom of my ear lobes is only covered if I stretch the band really hard and then it retracts after a minute or so to uncover that area again. The band that makes up the ear flap is just about 1 inch too small.  I do not have an overly large head.  (hat size normally 7 3/8)."
3.0,"Poor worksmanship, but I guess it makes sense because it's so cheap"
3.0,"The post bends so easily you will eventually break it off. Putting the earring in is easy, getting the back on is a nightmare especially with a post bending like it’s not a post. Also, very uncomfortable to sleep in. Those points can be sharp. If u want pretty and don’t care about price or quality this is totally for u."
3.0,Too small anfd material is of poor quality
3.0,Nice jerzee sweats...expect shrinkage after washing. I'm 6'3&#34; 206 lbs. and the XL fit fine before washing. Now they fit like a large. Hope this helps.
3.0,This is a really cool looking piercing however it is very heavy and pulls your lip down by the weight.
3.0,They ride up the thighs when active.  Not the most comfortable.
3.0,That it was not true to size of a plus size 2X
3.0,very attractive but the back part of the legs are loose.
3.0,They are adorable but very small and don't stay in your ear very well. I lost them the first day I used them.
3.0,"It was way too small. I got the largest size available and it would not zip up. I’m a size 10 in dresses. Otherwise, it was a cute skirt. The material didn’t seem cheap or bad. Too bad it was too small for me."
3.0,A very light weight raingear.  i  use this for gardening;  however the zipper does not attach effortlessly.
3.0,"Talle y envoltorio, super prolijo. Etiquetas y bolsa ok. Articulo nuevo, diseño hermoso"
3.0,These are beautiful but the cuff doesn't stay put. The gems are sparkly and nget tons of compliments.
3.0,"I got medium and they looked like extra large, the lnseam length was also loo long."
3.0,I did not have high expectations but this just looks beautiful and fit me nicely
3.0,"fits weird but, good customer service."
3.0,I was not impressed with the quality of the beads. And they were shorter than I had expected.
3.0,cool Idea just way too short. fit more like a shirt. returned it
3.0,Liked the shirt but runs really small. Gave it away
3.0,"I bought the red dress in size small and it fit beautifully! I am 5'5"", weigh 160 lbs. I wear size 8 pants and Small or Medium tops (36DDD). The dress is comfortable, soft, and it has pockets! I'm buying it in another color as well!<br /><br />Update: I was so happy with my red dress that I couldn't understand the negative reviews. I ordered the black with white stripes also in a size Small. That dress is completely different from the red one! The red dress is made of soft fabric that drapes beautifully but the black fabric is stiff and draped awkwardly with the pocket area  and the area between the waist and my butt sticking out. The red dress was just below my knee. The black one is almost 6 inches longer! The red dress had nicely matched stripes. The black one had a terribly crooked waist seam! I was so disappointed! I wanted another dress like the red one and I can not understand how they can be THAT inconsistent! I'm returning the black dress for a refund. I guess it's hit or miss. Some of the dresses are great and some are terrible."
3.0,We purchased several cloth masks for our cruise. The king and queen ones seemed perfect because they even matched our outfits for one of our dinners. But they were the worst masks we brought with us. I'm an asthmatic and I could not breath at all in these. I wouldn't recommend these at all.<br /><br />The Nautical themed masks were great though. Those were lightweight and comfortable. Got a lot of compliments on them as well.
3.0,Runs a little big. Very light and thin material which is perfect for indoors.
3.0,The hat and the scarf are great! The touch screen gloves don’t seem to work. Smh.
3.0,"It lasted me a few months before it fell apart. I managed to fix it, but fell back apart again later."
3.0,Returned . Didn’t like leather
3.0,Looks wider in the photo.  Nice but I perfer wider ties
3.0,"Looks nice nos made of shiny fabric. The quality is not the best, you will have to inspect the tie and cut some loose threads."
3.0,"It helps, but remember - such is only EVER meant to be a &#34;LAYER in the onion&#34; & NOT the entire thing."
3.0,"Super funny, but the print is that kind of print you can tell will start to peal off. So it looks a little cheap."
3.0,"I bought the small, and it seems more like a large in other brands.  Really long and wide.  Nice material and well made, but there isn't a smaller size that would fit me.  I usually wear medium shirts as well."
3.0,"They arrived individually packaged with mostly Chinese writing on the package.  Thankfully, I didn't need to read directions to put on a sock.  However, I was quite surprised that there were only 3 instead of the 8 as listed in the title.  While I was ordering I did notice that under the color part it says 3 pack, so I was very interested to see what arrived.  Even though I saw that when I ordered I was quite disappointed when only 3 showed up.  That is a huge discrepancy that needs to be taken care of immediately.<br /><br />They fit as expected and they were actually quite comfortable.  I purchased these to replace the thin nylon ones I desperately grabbed from CVS with my boat shoes were giving me blisters.  These are quite the step up.  They stay hidden and help guard my feet against blisters.  I especially tend to blister on my Achilles and these do cover that part of the foot.<br /><br />I do wish they were a little thicker, only because they feel like they will wear out quickly.  I took off 2 stars because of that and the fact that it says  8 pairs in the listing and 3 arrived.  Also it says unisex in the listing and there is no way these would fit my husband when they barely fit my size 7 feet.  I really hope they take the time to fix that title!<br /><br />I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
3.0,"I love the idea of this dress, a simple yet trendy item to throw on when planning an entire look is just too much. The tassels at the bottom are adorable, cute touch that elevates this basic Tee-shirt dress to something special. You can wear it with boots and a sweater in the winter or sandals and sunglasses in the summer. It’s extremely versatile and I’m all about that! My only issue with the dress is the quality of the fabric. Eve though I didn’t put the garment in the dryer it is pilling (those little balls that form on cheap fabric). I washed it per the directions on the tag and still ought a few wears out of it now I need to get the pilling off in order to wear it. You do get what you pay for though. It’s cute, I can get the pilling off and still wear it. This would be the perfect dress to travel in too, was it with a belt, a denim jacket. (Or even a leather jacket and flats), aNd you’ll breeze through the airport looking so chic that people will ask where you got such a cute dress. You can simply coyly smile and say something witty (I’m not witty in the airport but maybe you are, maybe you can say the perfect witty thing before jetting off to your destination)."
3.0,Funky waist.
3.0,"Is beautifull, largue innthe eaist but I almost can not raise my arms. Chisese measures are wizard"
3.0,The hat has less subtance than pictured.
3.0,These underwear are nice but they do not fit the same as the ones previously purchased from Walmart. I ordered size 7 what came was 14 but they were even smaller than the seven.
3.0,"Love the pendant but the necklace makes my neck itch, not sure but suggest wiping thoroughly before wearing. Otherwise a perfect fit."
3.0,"Beautiful and soft leather wallet with lots of pockets and inserts.  There are, however, a couple of issues I have.  I wish it was a bit bigger because it is difficult to fit some cards, photos and ID comfortably in without either squashing the contents or leaving some important stuff behind;  there are not enough clear photo holders or easy to empty pockets for often-used items like driver's licence, auto registration card, medical ID card, credit cards, etc."
3.0,Rings are nice looking with the carbon insert. I wore one to work for less then 2 weeks and the edges started rippling. I work as a mexhanic and typically where gloves. Theses are great if your just doing stuff around the house but i cant recommend them for blue collar work.
3.0,Super chte
3.0,pouch is somewhat small
3.0,"Bought this watch band for my daughter’s Gizmo2 watch. Cute style, but not very comfortable because the flap goes into the wrist and not on top of the other strap like most watch bands."
3.0,IDK. It's just ok...It feels more light a nightgown to wear around the house ?<br />Not as bad as hausfrau but up there IMO.
3.0,"The tie came as advertised in design, but the blue appears to be much darker than the photograph would make you think it is. It's blue, but a VERY dark blue, not like the Royal shown in the photo."
3.0,"Cons- Cheap, uncomfortable material.<br />Pros- looks as pictured<br /><br />Overall- wouldn’t buy again. They are semi alright and I’m not gonna worry about sending them back but I definitely am gonna look for a pair that look like these with better quality. You can tell they’re cheap looking at them on"
3.0,"First off the packaging is 5 stars for sure. They come in a nice carrying case, with an elastic band (bracelet?  Kind of large on me for that) and a guitar pick,<br /><br />The lenses are super dark which is good.  The glasses are very very lightweight which makes me very antsy as they feel very weak. My biggest issue with them is they just don’t look good on me.  I usually go for oversized ones because they look best on me but I love love love the vintage cat eye, that’s the look of my regular glasses.  Sadly, here it just didn’t work for me.  If they were a bit larger maybe.  Never seen my hubby with such an obvious that will not work for you face as he made when he saw me in these.<br /><br />Disappointed that they didn’t work out for me, but I suspect for the right face size/shape they’d be fine.  Also I goofed getting black.  I’d go with the white or red instead.  The black ends up looking like cheap old plastic glasses and the cat eye doesn’t feel like the star with the plastic and lenses both being so dark."
3.0,"The colors where bright and vibrant. My usual is that after wearing it two times, the inseam by the pockets started to open. The pocket area came off on top. I had to have my friend restitch the inside of it so it doesn’t happen again."
3.0,"Cute shirt, but Shell is misspelled.  It is SHFLL instead of SHELL. Disappointing."
3.0,"It’s ok, it fits fine. I bought it for a wedding or a night out but it looks too cheap. Will be returning it."
3.0,the top fits like a med not LG the bottom fits great tho top is way my shorter then it looks in pic but it is the same outfit u see to a T the sizes are off tho top not gonna match the bottom in size and I don't have triple D's Brest lolol but it is a nice sexy outfit tho and it came fast too so that's a plus
3.0,"Let me first say, My wife like the look and style of the Bikini is very different from what is sold out there. She really like the idea of how they place a semi shirt right in front of the bikini, it hides the stomach area, It's a good product specially for woman who have had several pregnancy and want to hide life's signatures. Now here are the negatives; when the bikini arrived she was excited and pumped until she tried it, the upper and lower part of the bikini ran too small, we were under the impression that this wasn't going to be an issue because we order the largest size available. My is 5'8 and 170 pounds.  I hope this review help make your mind."
3.0,"This is a cute shirt and it does have potential, but it didn't really work for me. I think the ruffle and the strings at the top of the arm are fun and that part looks nice. My main issue is the fabric. It looks cheap, it snags easily, and it's super thin. Since it's so lowcut, I wouldn't wear it anyway without an undertank, but one definitely needs to since you can see right through it(unless that's what you're going for). As far as sizing, I'd say it's pretty true to size.<br /><br />This shirt doesn't have long term potential, but if you're only wanting it for short term use, it might be worth a try. It's not for me, though."
3.0,"I'm smaller/average build (size 5) and this looked ridiculously poofy for a crop top.  I'm small chested so I can't imagine it looking better unless someone is stick thin. Good quality material though and really cute,  just won't ever wear it unfortunately."
3.0,"I got this backpack as a stylish day pack for traveling abroad. The straps were very slippery when it arrived so I rubbed the inside of them with rubbing alcohol to remove some of the wax. The backpack doesn't have great support (like on of those chest straps) so it isn't the greatest on my back. I also had to anchor the straps at the buckle with rubber bands because they would slowly loosen and provide even less support. Five stars for looks, 3 stars for support design. Also the magnet on the front buckle fell off so I can't close that pocket anymore."
3.0,Fits rather big
3.0,So the reviews said it ran a little small so I ordered up to a medium and it was true size so it was too big for me. I’m returning. Also had a strong chemical smell when opening the bag I’m sure it comes out with a wash though. Just saying that for me (120 5’3 about a size 26 waist) the medium was too big and I would have been fine with a small.
3.0,Kind of disapointing because of the pockets. They are there but they are useless. I guess I have shorts for around the house now because you cant fit wallet or your cellphone in those pockets - you will loose them
3.0,"Okay, but material could be better."
3.0,"Can't tell the right from the left, but wearing them now."
3.0,Looks good but doesn't fit faces that have no nose bridge.
3.0,I am 5'6 and I bought these shorts for running and they are loose compared to other running shorts. They do have a drawstring to keep them.
3.0,the pants runs small and the fabric a bit see thru the good thing is the fabric is very soft
3.0,"it fit me awkward. great material, everything fit well except tight on my arms and chest. and im only a 32B."
3.0,"Im 5'6, 180, 34D. The biggest issue with this dress is it's really, really, short! My butte cheeks were showing. I had to buy a slip with lace on the bottom to go underneath (not pictured) to add some additional length. If you have a booty, it will probably be shorter. The fit was pretty good and the color was spot on. I ordered an extra large but could have ordered a large but then it would have been even shorter."
3.0,Love the pants. But they stain easily. I am in able to get oil out of them. Sad because the material and cut are great.
3.0,"The slippers did not have the little tail on them as in the picture. My daughter picked them because the bunny with the tail was so cute in the picture. It is hard to tell what critter it is in reality, especially when the hat bit slides down over the critter’s face...  but she is happy with them so I did not return them."
3.0,Magnet holds well but watch comes aloose often.  You have to manipulate watch and loosen it through the strap every time.  The color is great and looks good but it is not easy to get on and off.  Would have preferred either a stretchy arm band or a different way of attachment.
3.0,I really like the watch itself but the band is too long and doesn’t look good lapped under plus it’s uncomfortable and difficult to put on<br />Too bad cuz the watch is very nice and an eye catcher.
3.0,"It it a real pain to get this thing on, but once it is on it looks very pretty! Unfortunately because it is larger it felt awkward leaving it in for extended periods of time and now I am lazy about putting it in again"
3.0,Order a size up. It was very small.
3.0,I'm a 9.5 so I had to order a 10.  The boot is a little long which I could deal with but it's so big inside that I could wear 5 pairs of socks and still have room.  These were also advertised as J Adams but I actually received Sodas.
3.0,I like the shirt but it’s very see-through
3.0,Too big in the top (I'm a b cup)too small in thighs (size 10 jeans) my thighs feel like hams tied off with string lol
3.0,Very thin material almost see through
3.0,"These are just ok.  They are super cute and sparkly, but each ball is made up of a bunch of tiny little gems/beads, and some of the gems have fallen off."
3.0,The socks looks nice and feels good. Little bit too heavy for my taste.<br />I wear size 11 and the socks are tight in toes when you wear it the first time. Hope after laundry it will be better.
3.0,It is an awesome product.  Very well made.
3.0,It could’ve been a little longer for me. I wanted floor length.
3.0,"The skirt looks exactly as it does in person but it was way too large for me around my waist. For reference, I’m 54, 33 hips and 24 waist — I should have gone with the extra small because the small was about 4 inches too big around my waist. Really cute skirt though."
3.0,"Overall this is a cute dress. The sleeves were a little tight for me. However, this is way more &#34;see through&#34; than I expected. I considered just keeping it but I'm going to return it."
3.0,"I sent the dress back. Overall great value for the price, but the split was too high in the front for me."
3.0,"The cups were a little too big on me (36-C, 150lbs, 5’4”) in size medium and the cups slid down in the suit without enough to keep them up. Just didn't quite work for me. Love the style though!"
3.0,"It's pretty small, but nothing a Hat-Jack could not fix. It appears to be reversible, but it does not do so very well."
3.0,"They are so so cute and I was pleasantly surprised by the neat packaging. However, I must caution the slippers are not soft or cushiony; therefore while super cute, they are hard almost like a clog shoes. I prefer soft but I will keep them."
3.0,"It's cute, thin material with the same pattern advertised. I think I expected an actual maxi skirt rather than a cover-up wrap bc of the item title, but it's definitely a &#34;wrap and tie&#34; cover up skirt."
3.0,"The beige color is great with blending into skin color and looking very natural. However, the material has a strange feeling - not like any other pantyhose I've worn. Being that they're one size fits all, I did have to adjust the size by tying the bottom under my foot to make them tighter. Also, they are not good for extended wear because of their thin denier. The first pair I tried teared after one wear."
3.0,"The insert is of poor quality, I will not stay attached to the frame."
3.0,"Print was not very clear, and distinct."
3.0,Meh- not bad for the price
3.0,Nice colors but it runs small
3.0,"I received these as a gift (I picked them out), and they are pretty, but the biggest issue I have is that the back end is flat, not rounded (at least the 8g size is). I am in the process of stretching my ears, and it is difficult to get the flat end into my ear. If they were rounded, I feel like they'd be easier to insert, and I'd definitely give them more stars. If you're already at the size you want and are just looking for more jewelry, they're great, but I can't recommend them for stretching."
3.0,you dont get the gift box with it as shown in picture.... brooch is VERY FRAGILE... CAN BREAK EASILY
3.0,They are nice for what I paid and I will wear them so I am happy.
3.0,"These are not for thick-ankled gals, unfortunately. I thought the laces would be functional allowing you to loosen the top, but no. The laces are purely decorative and don't even go to the top. And the opening is far too small for women cursed with cankles. I can't zip these up and will need to return them. It's really a shame, because they're a striking pair of footwear otherwise."
3.0,"I have very small wrists, and had to return this because the holes don’t go small enough for me to wear snugly. Looked like decent quality for the price, though. Slightly more orange than I expected, but looked like it would wear beautifully."
3.0,"Be aware that the material blend advertised is 95% cotton, 5% Spandex, however when I received the item, it was far less breathable and light than I wanted.  When I looked at the actual dress label, it is 65% cotton and 35% polyester.  This might be okay for you, but you should know that you're not getting what you think you're ordering.  I bought this dress to wear in the middle east where it is 108 degrees and I wanted something lighter than this."
3.0,It does it's job however like most reviewers my zipper has a hard time starting. it also is strictly for in doors as strong wind comes through the jacket. At 12.99 it's worth trying.
3.0,"I rated it tree star because it was not worth the price in my opinion, the metal of the brooch looked like one dollar quality... but then again maybe it’s just me..."
3.0,I washed these . They shrank to a tiny size. Really not great !
3.0,"Doesn’t matter how loose you make the belt, it’ll still ruin your loops. Even for the cheap price, not worth it. Just get a normal belt. I guess only positive is not having to undo a buckle to go to the bathroom.<br /><br />*edit* originally gave one star. Customer service should get 5 stars, they fully refunded me and I didn’t have to return the items. So I met in the middle with a 3 star!"
3.0,"was far to large for my nose, but very good quality otherwise. I think would be more suited for septum than as nostril piercing jewelry"
3.0,"It's not a bad necklace, the quality is ok for the price I guess. but mine doesn't lay flat in place like it's supposed to, kind of twisting. I see on some pictures it looks really nice and is laying flat. Maybe those people can share their &#34;secret&#34;."
3.0,Arrived ahead of schedule delivery....a good thing.  Recipient says looks too small.  Will have to wait until washed a couple of times in cold water..Design is very cute.
3.0,"I was disappointed because the jeans don't rise high enough--I thought they'd go just below waistline, but they're hip huggers and are too low.  This makes it difficult for the skinny jeans to stay up--and there are no belt loops to help with that, just an inner string to tie.  The quality is good, but I am disappointed in the fit."
3.0,"These are good sunglasses, but I have a couple of problems. The big one is the tiny screws that hold things together. After wearing these for a couple of days, one of the screws fell out. I checked the other ones and noticed a few were loose. I'll keep and eye on those, but I need to find a replacement screw for the one that's missing.<br /><br />The other issue is the gap between the lenses. These seem to be made for people with a more narrow nose. Since mine is on the wider side of normal, these glasses sit a little higher than I'd like. That's a personal preference, though."
3.0,The hair is too crazy and long for a child. Hair is straight texture and not African American hair.
3.0,These do not fit my 4 month old. They are too big. I am just going to keep until she grows into them. Definitely don't think they should be advertised for newborn and up as they are too big.
3.0,"These are smaller than I was expecting. I was hoping they were actual size. That I could have looked over, but the back of them are plain wood showing and doesn't look good as the earrings don't stay to one side"
3.0,Material is too light.
3.0,Ok wrap bracelet. Can look a little cheap. I prefer the velvet wrapped one with rhinestones
3.0,A little small and poorly made.
3.0,for grandkid
3.0,Sleeves were entirely too tight.
3.0,Look good but hurt like a bitch
3.0,item ripped the first time I tried it on
3.0,"Words from my girlfriend:  LOVE the color, love the slits up the side and it feels wonderful.  The downside, it wrinkles like crazy... scrunch with one hand for less than a half minute and it wrinkles.  Still I wore it around the house as a cover up at night (the kids were not home).  I'm guessing this one will need to be washed in cold and hung up to dry."
3.0,This would be a great band if it wasn’t so thin.
3.0,It pinches my skin so I cant wear.
3.0,Picture shows unique color. Mine is navy. I like it enough not to return it.
3.0,"Fit in waist but to long in length. Also, buttons were hard for my daughter to unfasten/fasten."
3.0,Faded in the sun after 2 months in it
3.0,"Cheap, thin and not the quality I’m looking for, but everyone is different"
3.0,Most worked great. But there were several that didn't. It's a good thing they were so inexpensive
3.0,I ordered XL just to be safe and figured I could wash in hot if it was too big. It was absolutely nowhere near an XL. I compared it to a size medium shirt of mine and it was smaller.
3.0,The material was very soft & thick but it seemed to run small. The sleeves were about 2 inches too short. The buttons are also very large and heavy and not sewn on well so they just hang and look like there going to fall off. I will be returning mine.
3.0,"Runs small, and the straps are delicate so be careful taking it on and off."
3.0,Shifty material
3.0,"Christmas gift for sister, she hated it.  But I am thinking she wouldn't have liked a gold Cadillac!  Can't please everyone."
3.0,Color was way off.  I thought it was chocolate. Came looking like taupe. I would need a medium even though I wear large.
3.0,Very sexy glasses when you wear them low. I have mine to my nose. But glasses are quite small and squeeze your face when worn properly. I can still see out the corners of my eyes when I have them on properly. Weird
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter when I found out I was pregnant.  It was our way of telling her that she was going to be a big sister.  We loved it because it was super sparkly and perfect.  After we told her, she was so excited to wear this to family occasions.  After one wash though, the sparkles and color faded really quick.  I recommend this, but I recommend not washing it until you know that you're not going to need it for a special occasion or pictures."
3.0,Loved the styling but it runs narrow and a bit small. I felt like my toes would almost hang over the top edge. Wanted to get the same color in a bigger size but they ran out in Amazon (they had them in the company website but I wouldn’t get the shipping benefits of Prime)
3.0,"The style & make is not what I expected, it is almost like just an imprint and not a design."
3.0,cute but not the warmest gloves you'll find!
3.0,"These sumglasses are pretty good for the price. The first time I got something for a little of nothing money, lucky me. Could be little more heavy and  steady in the lense area. Not complanting because the glare is gone."
3.0,tight around the middle...seems to be cut for athletic build.  Fabric is soft but does not feel as warm or comfortable as most cotton fabrics...would not purchase again.
3.0,"Cute dress, but cut small across the bust.  I am a 36C/D and the medium fit throughout the body but was gaping across the bust.  For $30, it wasn't worth altering or putting up with."
3.0,Cute but tiny and pearl just fell off 2nd day I wore them. They really are for little girls.
3.0,"great shirt, and very rugged.... but the sizing is way off and is too short...."
3.0,"I usually take a Large/Size 12. I bought an X-Large and it fit like a size Medium, maybe even a Small!"
3.0,They are very cool to look at but they hurt when I wear them more than ten minutes.
3.0,"I read the reviews and ordered an 11 for 10.5 shoe size.  Size seemed fine and I decided to wear the shoes inside for a day to check the comfort.  After a day my feet were very soar which I didn't have with Merrell's or Skecher's.  Sides and back of shoe were stiff which was fine, arch seemed to create instep pain and front side pain.  Obvious after 6-8 hours so returned.  I'd try before committing if you have any foot issues.<br />The pad is pretty arched and that may be an issue for some!"
3.0,"This is a cute nightgown and my husband actually likes it on me. It doesn't quite work for me, though. I normally wear a large for a looser fit, but sometimes I'll go up in nightgowns, since I like them looser. This XL is still too small for my tastes and it's not overly breathable. While it's not tight, my underarms are irritated when I wear it. Since this doesn't work as a nightgown for me and I wear dresses at home pretty much all the time in the summer, I've tried this one a few times around my home. The underarm irritation happens every time and it makes me sweat worse when outside. (I wear dresses to stay cooler when outside.) The material isn't my favorite either. It doesn't hold up well in the wash and it's not as soft as I'd like. It's a cute design, but it's not the best nightgown or even summer dress if your tastes are like mine."
3.0,"Perhaps it's my tendency of judging based on the fit on the model that disappoints. Perhaps it's just not my style. I love long, wispy dresses...this is definitely that. It also feels as if I'm wearing my grandmother's drapes. The length is great...the waist is a bit loose. The top is just too much. I'm in no way trying to showcase cleavage...the coverage is just so wide. I think on a tall, extremely thin woman, it would work great. I'm 5'5, 120 with a C cup. I'm going to play with it on my sewing machine and see what I can do. I'll post before and after if I'm any good. (I'm not)."
3.0,pretty but the post broke the first time I wore them
3.0,Smaller than I thought they would be.
3.0,Order a size larger than you need!!!! Cute pullover just disappointed it runs small.
3.0,The box was smashed when it arrived and the right shoe has a crack on side of sole
3.0,It works for all intents and purposes.  It need some alterations.  When based on the size chart but I should have gone a size down.
3.0,These are ok for a person with a long neck.  They hit my shoulders.  Not a fan.  Have them away.
3.0,I ordered an extra large bag lol it’s very small but it will be ok for what I need it for
3.0,it was much smaller than i had expected
3.0,These are okay but they run somewhat small and there are threads hanging off of them...but for the money they are acceptable.
3.0,Collar itself is very cute and affordable! Unfortunately my neck is just a tad too thick for the &#34;one size fits most&#34; dimensions. Will need some kind of clasp to extend the length. Keep that in mind if you're not quite on the petite side
3.0,"Came smashed in the package. If this was for me, I would have sent it back. For a 5 year old, he didn't notice."
3.0,This is very pretty but I am worried how it will last as it it so thin and delicate and I bought it for an everyday wear chain.The leaf design is barely visible but looks nice under a magnifier. But I guess the price is for what I got.
3.0,"Super soft, stretchy, but does rum small. If you really want a comfy waist I'd up size 2."
3.0,I didn't like material or colors once I got.
3.0,They look nice but too thin and run a little bit large. If you go with smaller size they would reveal your skin and anything underneath due being so thin. I wore them at gym and all the time I was pulling them up! They’re good to go out with because of being comfy and nice but certainly not good for gym!
3.0,pretty...but kind of heavy to wear it...
3.0,"This was a really fun product and great shine. My only concern is how thin the fabric is. On the one hand it is good because it does not look like a breathable material, but on the other I worry it will rip easy."
3.0,"They are comfortable, lightweight and durable, but they don’t stop the glasses from sliding down your face if you look down. I have found that the ones with hooks work best!"
3.0,"My husband thought this would be good for when he wanted to just carry a few cards in his wallet but also wanted to keep them safe - the RFID blocking is a nice feature. This is slim and fits well into a pocket (well, most pockets - men's pockets and some women's pockets), but the first impression upon seeing it is 'it's a bit on the cheap side'. It's lasted so far, but you get your money's worth, as the saying go, based on materials. That said, it holds three credit cards on one side, a place to put some cash (not a lot, but some), and three slots for coins (helpful for Euros and the like) that would take some time to get all of them out if you filled them up. He's using it more for the credit cards/ID and some cash. Oh, and a little hook I guess for keys, or maybe to help pull it out? But it's not the strongest."
3.0,"Runs very small, I would say that the XL is more like a medium. I can wear the bottoms but I’m not going to be able to wear the top unfortunately."
3.0,These panties were a little small and that makes them less comfortable.  I have similar styled panties from other brands that I would wear before I pick these out of my drawer.  Otherwise they were fine for the price....
3.0,"Fairly cute, but not high quality at all.  My baby gets these off in no time.  And since there's not much to the soles, I don't really use them much."
3.0,Couldn’t fit
3.0,"Cute dress, but after one wash, the seams were already coming apart!"
3.0,"I wish these would have fit, bc they are really cute and well made.  I could use them around my ankles but definitely not around my calves. :("
3.0,Canvas picks up dirt and is difficult to clean.
3.0,I am not able to wrap them as they are shown
3.0,"Despite the various reviews indicating that the costume ran large, I decided to purchase the size that indicated the exact measurements necessary. I was disappointed to find that the reviews were accurate when the costume arrived. Thankfully I am able to make the necessary adjustments myself with the help of my sewing machine. However, I would caution future buyers (that don't have the benefit of sewing skills) to purchase a size smaller if you fit the lower measurement of the spectrum. I will have to engage in significant alterations despite the detailed sizing information. Otherwise, the costume is sufficiently made and attractive."
3.0,"Love the fabric, but it is a lot shorter than it looks.  I am only 5 ft tall and it is 4 or 5 inches above my knees.  It also seems a little small and there is no inside tie to help keep it closed .  May have to return it."
3.0,"Price was great, however these are very cheaply made.  They work for what I ordered them for... around the house.  I am 5' 9&#34; and they are way too long... like 3-4inches too long.  The waistband string is awful and is unravelling already.  Work for lounging pants.  You definitely get what you paid for."
3.0,"Was a little bigger than expected but not by much, cheap thin fabric matariel. But it's worth it for the money, makes great costume"
3.0,Definitely not a sports bra. Little support and the sizing is off. I followed the sizing guide and the band is tight but the straps are very loose. I like the idea of it being a longline bra but it rolls up when you move around. The material feels okay and the color is nice. Good for lounging and not much else. Gives yours chest a real mono-boob look.
3.0,"It holds necklaces and does it’s purpose, but if the necklaces are too dainty and light this clasp will pull to the front. It tangled my necklaces more than when I don’t have it on, luckily it’s easy to untangle them with the clasp on. Mine is starting to look discolored and I’ve only wore it 4 times for 4-6 hours at a time. I wanted to give this 5 stars, but honestly I could live with out this thing. Not worth the buy."
3.0,Nice fit and quality but the clasp digs into my wrist and gets quite annoying. Also the band get caught on clothing because the piece that secures it does not stay in place.
3.0,A bit long..and wished buttons were black.
3.0,Very nice but disappointing in that it’s very hard to see any rutilation in the stones. Would buy again in a different gemstone.
3.0,I love it but the Neck is top wide
3.0,I ordered the pink slippers not the booties. They’re super cute. I love the way they look. However they fall off her feet. They seem to be wide.  I ordered the 6-12 months and my daughter wears a size 3 shoe. And these just come right off. They’re not horrible quality. However if you’re ordering these for the purpose of a non slip type slipper for your child I’d look elsewhere. These have ZERO grip.
3.0,"Dress is very dark- looks black,  not green. Their sizing chart is way off. Dress was huge."
3.0,Very nice dress just a little too short for me.
3.0,Wear to church it’s just ok for me.
3.0,"It does the job but it turned out to be more a child's pair than an adult pair. But hey, it did the job, so I'm okay with it."
3.0,Fit perfectly until washed then was smaller than I preferred
3.0,"The band is huge. From what I could tell it was one size. I have a small wrist so it wraps all the around to the watch. I have it on the second to last notch and will need to go to the last notch if I run with it.<br />The colors are also not as bright and pretty as the photo indicates.<br />To be twice as expensive as many other bands, I was somewhat disappointed."
3.0,"It's OK, but definitely not heavy duty"
3.0,got it as a gift..
3.0,"The shirt runs small, but it’s cute."
3.0,The gloves didn't even work
3.0,The blouse is completely see through its a lot more sheer than described also the front of the shirt is shorter than the back of the shirt and does not state that or appear that way in the photos.
3.0,I really LOVED the dress ... Tried it on looked perfect but when it came to the the night to wear it 😵 the under slip kept going up the back kept twisting to the side it was just a disaster!!!! But the dress is cute BUT CONSTANTLY FIXING IT!
3.0,I bought it for my 5 yrs old daughter. It was a bit small for her. She loves it but would have liked it a big larger.
3.0,"Looks cheaper than the pic, bit a nice small size, not too long"
3.0,They are warm but not waterproof...  Ended up return due to they were tight on me and the huge writting on them looked tacky.
3.0,Quality is what I expected but it would be nice if the purchase included​ the lens bag. They came with no type of case at all. You probably should mention that in the description.
3.0,"I ordered one set of the silver earrings to see if it would be good for my bridesmaids. The earrings are pretty if u see them from the front but when you turn them, they stick out in a weird way that I personally didn't like. I felt it made them look less elegant.<br /><br />The size is exactly the size I wanted, I would say they are big earrings. I will be keeping them for myself, for another occasion."
3.0,"My toddler (2.5 yrs) LOVES Sesame Street, and he got these as a Christmas gift (2018). When putting them on, the 4T size was more like a 2T/3T on him. He normally wears clothes that are up to 3T, so I thought going for 4T would be a safe deal. After wearing just a few times and a couple washes, the pants started getting holes on the inner leg, butt, and crotch areas; I’ll be fixing these soon so he can try wearing them again. Really bummed they didn’t last as long as I had hoped. I also couldn’t find a way to contact seller directly, otherwise I’d let them know first before reviewing."
3.0,"I like that it is light weight and will fit even very large people. Not wanting to sound mean. Quite the opposite. I bought these for my first paint party, and I didn't want anyone to be embarrassed if the apron wouldn't fit them. Very pleased to say it fits bigger people too! Biggest thing I didn't like was the placement of the pockets. Two small pockets right square in the center of your belly. A deep, slotted pocket that reaches from one hip to the other would work better. It was awkward reaching for my most used item in a tiny, tight pocket, located in my front & center. I gotta say though, they washed up nicely. I painted my logo on them with textile paint, and it went on quite well. I hope my logo will last a long time, as well as my apron."
3.0,"I normally wear XL, but ordered the multicolor in XXL. It fits like a XL, so size up if you have curves.<br /><br />The multicolor print reminded me of Bohemia, but in person the pattern and the material makes the shirt look like a 1970s disco shirt. I’ll have to play with accessories to see if I can pull it off without looking like a disco queen, lol"
3.0,Ran a little small.  I ordered 3 shirts (different styles) in same size.  This one ran a little small.
3.0,Cute but the lettering started to peel after the first wash.
3.0,The material is very wrinkled no matter what you do!
3.0,Much larger than expected for an XS
3.0,"This shirt was way too large for me. I like things pretty baggy, but this was not the fit I was expecting. Didn't like the shirt enough to purchase a smaller size."
3.0,Not exactly as I had expected. A little thicker then I had hoped. But not a bad product. L
3.0,Most of them are cute but material is so cheap that most have been casualties
3.0,I wear size 12 and medium fits fine.  Its very thin and can easily see through.  Wear with leggings or slip
3.0,"Is beautiful, but I gave 3 stars because I bought Champagne for bridesmaids, but it’s color is like a peach ou light pink"
3.0,"It’s really short, more like a shirt but it’s really cute"
3.0,Shows too much side boob
3.0,More like men's sizing than women's.
3.0,"I liked these put they shrank in length as soon as I washed them, I had to give them to a shorter person."
3.0,Wanted to love this but not enough bust support.
3.0,"Not that I was expecting to much for the price, it is a very cute design, my daughter loved it but ripped in the back, underneither where the strap meets the garment, after my daughter wore it for the 3rd time. After writing my review the company reached out to me to appologize that I was not satisified with thier product. They offered to send me a replacement and assured me they'd be looking into the quality of the products in the future. I have to say I'm very happy about this sellers communication and customer service. They went above and beyond to make sure I was a happy customer. Thank you."
3.0,El grosor está bien pero demasiado cortas.
3.0,Way tooo small. I ordered a large and it fits snug on my sister who wears primarily Smalls.
3.0,Too thick to wear for very long and very hard to get over head
3.0,"Item was too small to fit around my wife's ankles, no big deal she just uses it as a bracelet"
3.0,"Nice quality and cute purse that fits my iPhone 7 plus, but I can't use my phone through the clear back. It doesn't allow me to use the home button to access the screen."
3.0,it's way too long for me
3.0,I was hoping that the elastic would help mask my height but the suit bunches fairly bad I am fairly short 5’2”
3.0,"The pink was fine but the black one was too small. When I ordered, I had the impression that both would be adult sizes. Therefore I was fooled. I am only able to use one although I paid for two."
3.0,It fit good but it was torn from the sleeve like when u open boxes it had a slash on the sleeve.
3.0,Very cute and comfortable! The torso is really short though so girls over 5'5 probably would have some difficulties keeping the top from slipping down. The bra wire comes out after a few washes.
3.0,Its pretty but fit odd and not the same pattern.
3.0,"I have feet that are a bit wide, but not wide enough for a wide width size. I found these boots to be just a bit tight. Guessing they would be less tight on the average foot. The soul, although lug, is a hard plastic. They were very slippery when I first wore them. Will take some time to scuff them up. There is not much cushioning in the foot bed. The upper faux leather creased very easily. But they looked great and served the desire I had; to wear with leggings and cover the sock area. They fit tight to the ankle and moved with me. These are kind of a 50/50 purchase. If you are looking for high quality, long lasting, these might not be the boots for you. If you are looking for another pair for your closet which you will wear occasionally, these will be good. (I purchased these boots at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review. Unfortunatley I was not able to wear these boots long or on both feet. I suffered an injury and am on crutches.)"
3.0,"I like it though wish the black part was gold with black letters. Wouldn't mind paying the same price asmthe &#34;Trust No Bitch&#34; necklace if it were in gold, but none the less it's very good and stylish"
3.0,Update: they broke at the velcro strap after a few weeks of wearing. Sad outcome. We bought these for my 4Yo Halloween costume and she loved them! No blisters after 3 nights!
3.0,"I got this for one of my sisters for her birthday. I felt it represented her, as a mother. Both her daughter and son play on teams that use blue, as well as her husband an avid Gator fan. Looking at it, this charm is a great deal, and if the 'jingle' is told by the individual getting it, the importance grows to an even more person level.<br /><br />I only wish I could have had the same, with two balls, slightly smaller, with two separate charm sounds.<br /><br />I was given this item at a significant lower price for trying out, and giving an honest revue."
3.0,"It looks nice, but was smaller than I expected, so we sent it back."
3.0,"Very pretty, but not as shown. Much shorter - will not wrap. Will only cross in front or tie in back."
3.0,"I don’t really have a opinion on whether I like or dislike this item. Also, I haven’t wore it yet so hopefully it will be fine."
3.0,Much smaller from what I expected.
3.0,"We bought this for my 2.5 year old and ordered it in a 4t, hoping it would be a little big and would last a while. Unfortunately, it fits him pretty tight and I don’t see it lasting through spring."
3.0,I am 5.2 and 120 pounds pants  to small I had to return it
3.0,36DD smaller than I had expected. I decided to keep this and have worn it to see if it was going to &#34;relax&#34; or stretch out a bit. I think it has slightly but for me it is pretty tight even on the last hook.
3.0,Not a nice workout fabric. Felt heavy and cheap
3.0,The shirt is cute and very soft but has zero moisture wicking capability. Wore it on a run and was soaked. Maybe better for a gym workout or yoga.
3.0,"Bought this for my rehearsal dinner and wedding. It was super cute, but it broke the day of my wedding and it was only the second time I used it. It got me through the event and thankfully didn't break during it, but it eventually shattered. Nice if you don't plan to use it again."
3.0,It was just a little tight but it will be ok
3.0,Perfect Glasses in every way except that are designed for tiny asian heads not Large American Heads
3.0,"So I got mine today and was super happy, couldn’t wait to try them on. BUT the freaking barbells are too damn long. They r as long as the one I got when I first got my tongue pierced. Had to swap the top with an old barbell. Super cute but waaaay to long."
3.0,It's plastic looking but still for the price it's right
3.0,Disappointed. It doesn't quite look like the picture and the pockets aren't really usable. I should have read the reviews a little more thoroughly.
3.0,"Fabrics nice, colors great, however the seam in the middle connecting the top and bottom is a bit annoying, would be way better if it was one piece."
3.0,[[VIDEOID:140aa7bacd32a5ca758e54572bb685ca]] The black with blue things fell apart easy.
3.0,"Its a little smaller than I expected, but otherwise very nice.  The glass dome is clear and the wood base fits nicely."
3.0,"She has another pair of these.  She likes the color, however the lens on these do not provide a lot of protection from the bright sun."
3.0,Wish it had a liner
3.0,"While these bands were affordable, i could feel as if they should've been even cheaper based on the ones that i got. the metal adapter on the leather one had already been damaged by the time it got here, and the quality of the leather itself was very flimsy. the other red white and blue band seemed great though, that was in good condition, although the material had irritated my wrist after a few hours of wearing."
3.0,"Fit is OK, but the nightgown is very short."
3.0,"I expected an elastic waist. It has a zipper and no stretch to waist. Not what I wanted, but otherwise as expected."
3.0,"Love the glasses, fit perfect, very stylish. Only issue I ordered these in silver n got gold. But still like them jyst not as happy as I could have been."
3.0,"I bought these for a friend because amethyst is her birthstone.  The packaging was okay, but certainly nothing special.  The stones themselves are darker than I expected (certainly darker than the picture).  In fact, she wore them to my house the other day and they looked black (she has long, dark hair).  I only recognized them as the ones I'd given her because of the shape."
3.0,Length is short
3.0,"Beautiful dress, good quality but not true size. I wear L size and this one was too small, seems like M rather than L"
3.0,Granddaughter was elated to get them. Wore almost every day. Lasted 45 days and lights stopped blinking and pink wearing off tips. Too late to return
3.0,"With the reviews given I was under the impression that I should size up when ordering this shirt for my friend who is a slim and short guy that normally wears a size small. It came in and it's most definitely a very true to size and perhaps even a little larger than that medium. I'm going to keep it and throw it in the wash once or twice and hope it shrinks down ( which people indicated would happen ) but this is one instance where reading the reviews was the least helpful thing I could have done. ALL THAT SAID HOWEVER, it's an awesome shirt!"
3.0,These were great for the first day I wore it............but as soon as it gets moist (from sweat) it stetched out to the point that I had to keep retightening it.  It is also a bit large to begin with and I had it tightened to its smallest length.  They need to make some that are shorter length!!
3.0,These are a little on the flimsy side for larger gauges. I have 1 inch and they kept rolling up. I'm sure they would be perfect for smaller sizes. They're very thin but the colors are great!
3.0,"Bought for my 5 year old and it was way too big, this is only for adults"
3.0,I loved this ring. Then I washed my hands a few times with it on and the stone has a white spot now.
3.0,"I have a small head compared to most reviewers so the fit isn't bad to me, I can see how it would be uncomfortable for most. The craziest thing is the box and paper that comes with it has preachy religious Jesus talk. Not what I expected at all, and conflicting because it's really in your face. If you like that stuff cool I guess... But if you hate religion being pushed in your face avoid?"
3.0,"Purchased for a friend but they are not great quality, cheaply made. Gave to my daughter instead, they are great for  when my daughter plays dress up."
3.0,Shipping was fantastic. The earrings are beautiful but I wanted an ivory pearl like the picture shows and instead got a bright white one. :(
3.0,The dress is cute but the straps are way to long. It would be better to have adjustable straps. I fixed them  and now I love it.
3.0,"WAY too small! I would definitely advise anyone to SIZE UP! I brought the 8/9size, and my daughter is 7yrs old and it’s small will not be able to wear it next year it’s a super cute design and color but the shorts are super tight and hike up, the top fits okay but still too snug."
3.0,"Me encantó el modelo pero la tela es un poco cheapy. Ya tiene bolitas y la he usado unas 5 veces. La lavo a mano por las dudas. Eso sí, tienw buena caída y vuelo."
3.0,Liked the style. Looked good.<br />Difficult to take on and take off. Magnets rusted very rapidly and the holding capacity did not last a very long time. 4 months.
3.0,Smaller than size but they were easy to work with.
3.0,Very cute. Just wish the carrot ones were  placed a bit differently.
3.0,"Sent it to my mom for mother's day but she states the headband broke and no barrette with it. Had to find one herself. Otherwise, she states the hat is pretty."
3.0,Looks great. Too small to fit over my hand so I had to give it to my girlfriend. She seems to like it.
3.0,"Normally I wear a large, but my hoodies I like as Xtra-Large because I want them oversized.  I ordered an Xtra-Large in this and it hits right below my waist.  Not really happy with this."
3.0,"ordered size small and even though the tag said small, don't believe it."
3.0,"I ordered this for my preteen granddaughter, it was short in the waist, but large and ""baggy"" for a medium size..."
3.0,"These are very pretty pendants, but it is very obvious that it is not the best quality. But hopefully the rhinestones don't fall off so easily for me. I'm use to wearing my necklaces everyday, day and night and with these pendants I know I won't be able to do that. But other than the quality, these are very pretty pieces for their price."
3.0,It's a great dress for taller ladies.  I love the color and style but it was a bit on the longer side.  Asked tailors to see if it could be shortened but it couldn't.<br /><br />I still wore it a little long.
3.0,Definitely not for your casual Neko girl cat ear wearer. Perfect if you want ears for a kids costume
3.0,The protectors did their job but they only lasted for 2-3 hours before my heel poked through the bottom of the plastic. I got the protectors for my wedding since my ceremony was in a garden. They prevented me from sinking the ground but when I went to switch out my heels for flats I noticed the heels had gone straight through the center of the protectors. Expect only one good wear out of each pair.
3.0,"Very cute outfit. The reason I’m rating 3 starts is because it does run small. Also, the fabric doesn’t stretch at all like it should being a costume for infants. Babies can be chubby and long like my son. This outfit is made for babies who are slim."
3.0,This boot is beautiful but very uncomfortable. I ordered my normal size and it was too big. Above the toe dents into your feet.
3.0,"Cute dress! I feel that the fabric, while thick, might pill easily. I ordered a small and it was still a little too big. It was just big enough that I probably would not wear it. Sent it back. :/"
3.0,"Really cute. Not as big ad I thought it would be, but I'm happy."
3.0,Fun to wear silly shorts
3.0,"Fit well, however it was very thin. We made our own mask as the one that comes with it is inaccurate and too hard to wear. The costume itself - it's spots and the suite wear easily and is already losing its color."
3.0,Very nice but again had to take up the hem.
3.0,Smalll.....more like for a toddler than a 10 year old.
3.0,If you're between sizes choose a size up
3.0,"Not sure how people are saying they're made with quality. Very cheap and the back of one snapped in half the first time I put it on. Love the design and still think they're super cute. Came in a super cute box and nicely packaged, but the actual earring back is cheap.<br /><br />Edit: customer service is great and sent another pair. Quality still isnt amazing, but they didnt snap immediately. Still feels like they wont last past a few wears. Very pleased with customer service."
3.0,"Son likes, but the ankle strap is not sturdy. Was expecting it to be thick like the straps on crocks. It is flimsy and one of the straps appeared more stretched than the other. Will do for the pool, but wouldn’t wear out and about while running errands."
3.0,"Pretty dress, I really do like it! But the top was constructing my boobs! It was so tight, I had to return it. Otherwise beautiful and classy. May reorder a size M instead of small in the future.<br />I’m [almost] 5’5 and about 125lbs"
3.0,"It was too thin, light, really could not stand up too cold"
3.0,It was as described. I felt it was a bit cheap looking. Granted it wasn’t expensive by any means but should have probably been half the cost it was. Wish it came in a box.
3.0,"I really wanted to like this dress.  Unfortunately under the arm is really loose making ""wings"" under the arms. I tried adjusting the strap length but it only moved it closer to my armpit. Going to have to return."
3.0,They are beautiful! But they are SO heavy and really pull down on my ears.
3.0,It runs bigger than what it says.  I returned them.  It was a nice try.
3.0,"The only thing I hate about this band is the connector pins. They ""jump"" out of place all the time because they are spring loaded. So if you catch your watch on anything the pins are immediately going to fly out. It doesn't happen terribly often but it still happens enough to annoy me. I often find myself not using my right hand as often just because the pins fall out all the time. Otherwise I love the band it's super comfortable and really easy to make bigger and smaller."
3.0,Art work starting to peel after less 10 washes
3.0,"Bust cup size is either (a or b) rest of bathing suit great. I took padded cup out,<br />Had no support so I wear a bra underneath it. I wear a 42d bra.<br />Wished they would make theses Asian made bathing suits with purportedly size busts, American women have boobies."
3.0,I dislike  - Made in China -
3.0,It's kind of cheap looking and is not actually Grey at all. It's a light purple. Sent it back because I needed grey.
3.0,Cute dress. I'm normally a medium but I got a large after reading all of the reviews saying it ran small but it still fits like a bodycon dress. Keep that in mind when buying
3.0,Stylish and cute! Unfortunately it stained the collar of hubby's shirt. He's not wearing it again.
3.0,"It's kindof plain from the front, then fun in the back. I'm VERY long waisted, though, so the back looked a little odd (and also makes it look like I have back fat). You can't see in the pic, but the straps on the bottom are about an inch away from my body. I also have a very round, sticky-outy butt though. I read in the reviews that someone else detached the straps from the bottom and turned them into a to-up halter. I thought about doing that, but decided to return it since I'm not in love with with it and I don't think changing the straps would change my mind much."
3.0,These earrings were not what they appeared to be:  the color of the stone was “off” and the earring was small.
3.0,"Nice, thick material. Not a super formal style shirt. Ran very small; had to return for a larger size."
3.0,"I take back most of what I said. I'm considering returning this because this wasn't worth my money at all if you decided to be lazy with the package and not even care about trying to fix this. There was nothing connecting the smaller finger on the far right of the picture, it was just stuck there. When I tried to check it out, it immediately fell out as there wasn't any keychain/circle (if you don't understand) connecting the finger with the hand like the other fingers. This is a bit angering as this was 21$, if it's going to break because you were too lazy to put it back together, why do I have to spend 21$ on this? Horrible."
3.0,Colors were good.
3.0,"The style of this dress is cute, And the length is good, but it runs large. The skirt gaps open in the back because the elastic there is too loose and there is no way to adjust it. Essentially, the waistband is too large for my skinny daughter. The armholes were also too big. Maybe a smaller size would have been better. The fabric is also quite thin, nice as a lightweight summer dress, but thinner than I was expecting. It also wrinkles very easily."
3.0,"Don't expect it to look like the picture when you get it! This is a picture of it glowing in the dark looks fancy but is not, fine for small girls"
3.0,super cute print but ripped the first time I wore them and are more of that not so soft legging material... :( bummer I really wanted to love them but I will probably end up throwing away since the stitching didn't stay.
3.0,It's a nice shirt but the size runs a little small.
3.0,"the pattern and colors are cute. however, the fabric is cheap and sort of scratchy on the inside and the buttons feel like they're going to pop off at any second"
3.0,Cheap fabric. Weird fit.
3.0,"It didn't fit me right. I sent it back. This dress would look great on a taller, slimmer person. I am 5' and 120lbs. I looked like a blob."
3.0,"Love this pattern! Unfortunately this pair was too big, so hardly ever wear this one. I did order a different pattern from this same co though and that one fit great."
3.0,The fabric was a little too thin.
3.0,I didn’t like that the description didn’t show the Bees on the end of the arms of sunglasses.  Not a fan of the Bees icon for men.
3.0,Was disappointed the look was cheap. I returned it because the creme color was darker than the picture. Chose another Kate Spade bag.
3.0,Very cute but the calf part of the butt is very undersized I have chicken legs and they wouldn’t zip order in wide calf if your not 120 lbs I’m 5”6 size 16
3.0,"Not a true size, fit a bit snug and my breast was overflowing."
3.0,Nice design but fabric is thin so it's not for keeping you safe from the virus as a mask but will keep your neck warm on a cold weather as neck gait
3.0,turned copper from wearing it
3.0,"The material was too cheap for a “semi-formal” dress. This is something I’d wear to brunch or the beach, not a wedding"
3.0,They were not as pink as they look in the picture. They were much lighter.
3.0,"The shorts goes up when I run, so it is great for strength exercises. Not so much for aerobics"
3.0,These were way too big
3.0,My boobs made me return this dress.
3.0,Much too big to wear as a ring and i wish there was a way to keep it open as it's always trying to collapse in on itself but once you find the right spot to get the chain in it makes for a decent necklace.
3.0,"Excellent squirrel ears. Totally meh tail. It’s not bushy - almost looks more like a rat tail. It comes with a clip, but it’s impossible to clip onto something because of the way it’s attached. I’ll jazz up the tail and come up with an alternate way to secure it."
3.0,very comfortable . stylish.
3.0,Didn't realize it would be so huge
3.0,Skrunk after washing.
3.0,The material was good but the cut was too big. They were shaped like mens pants more then womens with a very low crotch.
3.0,Sizing isn't correct so they are pretty tight
3.0,"The dress material is soft and smooth. The top of this dress barely covers my nipples (DD) and provides no support. The length is good, skater dress style. I wish the top of it for as I really like the material and style."
3.0,"They fit the description, and they're stretchy. I just didn't care for them too much once they arrived."
3.0,nice looking billfold but there is a small flaw in the front.
3.0,Clasp broke immediately
3.0,I don't know if it's just me but this dress looked weird on me. It had gapping by my arm pits and just didn't look flattering on my curvy figure. Probably look better on a tinny woman.
3.0,gave it away..... way too small.
3.0,"I love comfy skinny jeans. These are cute. They have a clean look, with a little fray in the front that makes them look fun.<br /><br />Unfortunately the sizes are off for me. I normally wear an 8, but in skinny jeans if they are even a tad too big then when I bend over the come down in the back and show my undies. I have a size 30&#34; waist and according to this size chart that's a size 6. I reluctantly purchased that size hoping they would fit. The size chart says that size 6 is 28 1/2&#34; to 30 1/2&#34;. I figured I'd be safe. The pants showed up and the tag reads &#34;6/27&#34;. These are a little tight on me. I can still wear them, but they aren't comfy like my other skinny jeans.<br /><br />These are very cute though. There's a little fading on the front and back with a few areas that are slightly frayed. It gives them a more fun, youthful look rather than some boring old mom jeans. I wish the waistband weren't so skinny. I think a little thicker of belt lines are more flattering.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent pair. It seems I'm the only one who has had sizing issues so far, but I wanted to bring it up for any shoppers out there. I can still wear them and will wear them when my other pair is in the laundry, but this isn't going to be my go-to pair unfortunately. I was sent these for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of the pants, this is my honest opinion."
3.0,"Well the moment it came in I HATED it. The material is painfully thin, and the cut on the bottom of the dress is really weird. Super short in front (I'm only 5'2&#34; and it comes to lower shin) and the front drags on the ground. I wore it around the house a bit (because I wasn't going to wear it outside in public) and over time it actually expanded to the point to where it started to look cute. I do love the pockets, but this thing is IMPOSSIBLE to keep de-wrinkled. So if you're into the SUPER casual look (or just need a cover up for the beach or the pool) this will do."
3.0,Thought I was getting a sweatshirt it is not sweatshirt material it is a slinky polyester
3.0,"The arms run small. I ordered an XL, the the top was more of a Md fit. So I couldn't wear it. I passed it to my neice."
3.0,"Small, not for adults, not well made"
3.0,"I liked those, nice texture but there was a pocket in the inside that was scratching me :( returned."
3.0,Love this item but the length is too short for a dress and loo long as a top.  Quality and color good.
3.0,"My only complaint about these were the back fell off of the earrings a lot, i even lost the earring because of that few times. Good prduct though"
3.0,"Well I ordered the black and I got the blue.... i have the black in another pair of glasses and they fit, look perfect, the blue on the other hand don't clean easily, and also the blue starts to come off after cleaning the classes too many times. This order again was suppose to be black and not blue, air hate returning things so thought I'd try these out....not impressed, that's why less stars for the review...but If I actually got the black ones I would have given 5 stars!!"
3.0,Really really not Justable and it runs big. There’s uncomfortable
3.0,I ordered the 10 and 12 long grey pants and both were too small. I normally wear a 10.  Fabric was good and fit was good besides the waist.
3.0,"Basic navy tie was just what I wanted. Cuff links's are just as pictured. Big surprise was the tie bar though, IT'S A SPOON!  I'm not wearing a spoon for a tie bar sorry."
3.0,"I thought it would be bigger, but it is nice material."
3.0,"Pattern is super cute! I wish the sweater was softer, tho! It’s a bit more on the itchy side with this material!"
3.0,The logo lettering is all messy and the zippers are tough but for a dudes beach bag its perfect.
3.0,Love the hat design. The threading of the embroidery makes the hat look cheap and uncared for.<br /><br />Shipment ruined it with a dent because they shoved it in my tiny mailbox. This should be handled as if fragile.
3.0,"Not what I expected, gave it to my daughter"
3.0,They fit well but stretch out when wash them
3.0,Was shorter than most maxi dresses and I am only 5'-4&#34;.  Thin material as well.
3.0,"I am tall and heavy set and this shirt just isn't flattering at all.  For some reason it hangs wrong.  I thought I was going to really like it and maybe a shorter waist girl that is smaller might fit into it better.  I am 5'8"" tall."
3.0,"Bought these for my husband and noted they run on the small side.  He normally takes a large and an extra large or 2X, would of been a better fit. The fabric is definitely to be worn under another piece of clothing i.e.ski pants/jeans/slacks or sweats. He can't see running in them with temps of 32 degrees. Although, he does like the fleece lining.  If you are looking for running tights,these are not it! Go with something heavier and with fleece lined."
3.0,I really did think the outfit was cute and I did buy the work in the week was very cute it just took a long time to get here because it was from China but I am a size 0 and purchased a large and it just fit
3.0,Rough finish. Indic not know what to expect for the low price.
3.0,Love how cute these are but they do run a bit small! I would order one size up!
3.0,Not as long as picture depicts. Runs small.
3.0,Very disappointed with the kind of watch band on this watch. It did not have a clasp for you to open and close. You have to slip your hand through it and the magnetic closure does not hold together. I had to return this product.
3.0,A funny smell in the shirt. wouldnt even go after washing. didnt like texture of material.
3.0,"I really liked the look of this jumpsuit both on the site and when I received it however, it is very uncomfortable to wear. I agree with another reviewer that it is itchy at the sleeves and very restricting on the upper part because of the lace. It is a beautiful pattern but does not have any give. The sleeves are too small at the wrists even for me which mine are very small. I don't know if this was just a defect of this particular item or if this is standard of it. The material for the pant is very comfortable."
3.0,Overall held up pretty well. They are a good sport shades. Paint is peeling after heavy use.
3.0,Not flattering for larger natural chest
3.0,"The shoe fits well, appears to be made well, and is very comfortable.  BUT the description says “leather.  It is not.  As soon as I opened the package I knew this; the odor coming off the shoes was it the smell of leather but plastic.  They are PU “leather”.  I am getting very tired of this happening.  Say vinyl if that’s what they are, don’t lie and call it leather.  Vinyl does not hold up as long, so I am suspecting I will have to buy another pair before this dance season is over, and they won’t last long enough to be passed down."
3.0,Cute dress but very snug. I’m 5’8 and weight 160 so I ordered a large. Definitely gives off a Wednesday Adams vibe. The dress is shorter than I wanted but it does poof out like the picture. I had to wash it because it was very wrinkled when it came in and my iron broke. It was basically the same size when it came out but I don’t think the material could withstand multiple washes.
3.0,Nice but too clingy. Should  make it in cotton blend
3.0,I do like this surgery cap. I work in animal medicine and it keeps my hair clean during surgery and dental cleanings. I like the sweatband material on the forehead area and the satin lining inside. The print is lovely as well. I received 1 cap not 2 as listed in the title.
3.0,"Fit  a little tight, but I am losing weight so I will keep because I like the cut."
3.0,It is not 100% cotton
3.0,I surprised that the band comes without watch band pins. Returning.
3.0,"Came from China guess sizes there are different than the U.S,"
3.0,"Good fit and color is exactly like the pic,  however,  I thought it would be a warmer fabric,  but it was freaking cold,  and felt similar to sateen. Not very useful for a sleep shirt in the winter.  Kept it, but cant use it for what I wanted."
3.0,"Wooden base has not been well sanded or varnished.  For the money, I expected a little nicer quality."
3.0,Beautiful case. Not for 100's cigarettes....
3.0,"Very comfortable and stylish...UPDATE-after wearing these 1-2 times per week (and not all day), the rubber soul is starting to come apart form the leather.  Just in a tiny section, but enough to worry about quality."
3.0,"It is not cotton, just polyester knit."
3.0,"This is a really really nice swimsuit. Material is nice a thick, however I feel like it is for women with a short torsal. It does not do far enough up the back."
3.0,"It's a little heavier than what I thought it would be, with my stuff in it it's almost to heavey"
3.0,"I love the fit, but material is so thin you will need to wear a slip underneath.  Overall pretty good for only 10 bucks. Probably will order another one in a darker color."
3.0,Sizing is off. I normally wear a large or xlarge depending on the brand and material. These run huge and had to reorder a medium. They are also very long for someone with a shorter torso.
3.0,"My daughter loves it, except I didn't know it wasn't waterproof and let her take it in the bath. So on watch #2 the step counters doesn't count correctly. My watch says 5000 he's says 1600...🙁"
3.0,It's a through over your shoulders not like a sweater but the material was very comfy for cool weather
3.0,It was a little long and there was no bow as the picture show. All and all I like the skirt.  But you should tell the customers the picture is not true to form.
3.0,"Bought these for a family Christmas party. They were such a disappointment...seams not sewn completely, stray threads and cheap looking."
3.0,"I like it, and I can make it as tight or loose as I want, but it's very magnetic."
3.0,Looked cheap and wasn’t smooth
3.0,I had the chord about a week before the clip that latches to the badge broke.  This is substandard just for that.  Every other piece operates as top shelf
3.0,"It was very small, the sizing on here is confusing bc there is xl, 0x, and 1x. The actual shirt says xl on it but I ordered 0x, thinking it would be bigger but it's not. It has no give so it's pretty form fitting. I reordered in a bigger size so we shall see!"
3.0,"Would not read sd card (32GB, 16GB, 8GB) have not tried 4GB, 1GB."
3.0,"The color and the design is very nice.  Fabric soft and hopefully it will wash ok, will see. It will probably need ironing.<br />It needed small adjustment to the chest area.  It does not look as advertised. It is ill fitting. Before it can be worn it needs few adjustments to fit well. I am keeping it because I was able to make it fit but I would not buy it again."
3.0,I liked the material. The size was a bit wrong
3.0,The shirt is a little on the thicker side and the sleeves are stitched in the rolled up position which I don’t particularly like! But the main reason I give it 3 stars is the fact that I ordered an xl and it fits like a tight large 😒 the color of the shirt is beautiful and would def order a size up if it was available.
3.0,"i bought it as a gift for one of my best friend, hope she will like it, is nice and cute"
3.0,"They look great on, but they slide out of ear hole easy when you don't want them to.<br />I do still love them."
3.0,These glasses are extremely lightweight. I bought them for working on my computer and watching TV at the same time. The quality of the lenses are not as good as other readers I have. It takes some getting used to when switching from computer to TV because the top of the glasses have n frame. I thought that would be easier but for some reason it is not. I don't use them too often. Nice case though.....
3.0,Fits very small! The material is not what I expected either- it doesn’t feel like a material I would work out in.
3.0,"Fits perfect except it runs very looooooooog.  I am 5'4&#34;  36, 30, 40  usually M fits me well. this fit perfect except it was about 10 inches too long and because the material is stretchy and I'm not a great seamstress, I returned it."
3.0,These pants aren’t as loose as the picture shows. They are very clingy and see through. The clingy-ness isn’t a deal-breaker but the see through I can’t get with.  I guess I wear these around the house only. If you want that loose leg look then get a size or two too big. The waist is drawstring so you don’t have to worry about it being big in the waist.  If you prefer the clingy look then get your actual size.
3.0,Well I do like this product it never stays on the right side. It shows the backside of the necklace quite often. Other than that is extremely cute!
3.0,Cute but thin.
3.0,So disappointed in the skeleton feet.  The other ones are cute but it is so obvious in wearing two right feet 😢
3.0,The quality is definitely not the best and it is not leather at all but it does the job. I wouldn't recommend paying more than 5 bucks for this.
3.0,You definitely get what you pay for! These are super cute but did tarnish.
3.0,"Ehhh, it's ok I guess"
3.0,"I have extremely sensitive eyes to bright light and they did not help as much as I thought they would.<br />As some have reported, the weight is a bit heavy and tends to pull my glasses down.  I find it hard to get<br />used to seeing everything in amber."
3.0,"I was expecting glasses with a bit more fit and finish for the price I paid ($24).  I certainly wasn't expecting high end for the price, but something similar to Foster Grants at CVS or Walgreen's.  These aren't quite up to that standard.  Ive been wearing them off and on for about three weeks and so far so good.  They are super cute and ive received a couple of compliments on them."
3.0,Good sun protection. Great for my Asian face! Doesn’t touch the top of my cheeks when I smile.
3.0,"This top is as described, but I found it too flimsy and small for the price. I am plus size and I feel this would fit better on a thinner person."
3.0,The length of the shirt is all wrong width is fine but comes up to high in the front
3.0,"No black was sent, I ended up with a blue, silver, and 2 gold with no black...Seems to be good quality"
3.0,I bought cause it was supposed to fit plus size however once I got it an tried it on it was a joke I normally wear Torrid clothes size 0 which it equal to a size 12 this must have a size 9 I returned it cause not keeping something I can’t use. The shipping time was good.
3.0,"The dress overall is cute. I bought a large, and it still rides up on me. Constantly having to pull it down."
3.0,This ad us deceiving... you only get one...NOT three
3.0,Exact as shown on display but never was expecting both chains to be combined into one
3.0,It fits me well but is kind of fragile because of the thin band...
3.0,It's in the correct size but it it didn't fit like a 2x should… it was slightly smaller than what I'm used to.
3.0,"I bought this in October. The backpack itself is fine. However, the cart is a little too foldable. It won't stay locked in the unfolded position, the the backpack keeps falling forward. There seemed to be some holes made to put in bolts to lock it open, so I did. That worked for a while, but it's only December and it's already an issue again. I'll try to figure out how to make do, I guess, but I wouldn't get this backpack again."
3.0,A dress for church. Or casual events. Fits nicely.
3.0,It seems on thin side for for a hoodie in my opinion with average quality fabric and stitching.
3.0,"What it does is help any hat, cap, etc for more snuggly and prevent wind or other other factor that causes a hat to fall off or not for properly. I have a small head and having this product offers me the opportunity to select hats that I like even if it's a little too big. On the other hand, the paper that covers the tape is VERY difficult to remove. The process of trying to remove the paper takes too long and it's frustrating.  Somehow the company need to figure out an easier process."
3.0,Very soft and thick. Friend loved them.
3.0,"I love this top, so much so that I ordered one in each color (XL)...sadly, it was still too snug and form fitting!  My form just foesnt work well with snug and fitted..."
3.0,"This is not really the item from the picture.  It is two separate pieces and the plastic piece ties and fits over the hat.  It was hard for my son (5) to keep it in place and wear it at school so he now just wears a mask.  Great product in theory, but what was sent didn’t match up to what it looked like you were getting."
3.0,Ok and will suit my need
3.0,We bought the newborn size and it was quite large for our little one
3.0,Glasses look nice but fall short on several levels. The glasses have a real &#34;plasticy&#34; smell. It is hard to explain but it is almost too strong to even wear. I'm hoping the smell will wear off. The lens quality is not great.  The orange color distorts the color of things through the lenses. For the price they are a decent clone with several flaws.
3.0,Nice if you are conservative. Earrings a little too small
3.0,Not big boobs friendly
3.0,The adhesion didn’t last too long but the lanyard was very useful though!
3.0,This is a beautiful ring but make sure you order the right size. Its to much arguing w the seller to return it. 😡
3.0,"This item was not the same color pictured, also fit rather large, tight on my body but long in length. It does not fit the picture at all. However, it is comfortable and turned into a sleep shirt rather than a swimsuit cover-up."
3.0,"Not the best ones out there, but hey, they are the cheapest! Served the purpose to make some little guys happy."
3.0,"Ordered size XXL but in US size it is approximately a 10/12.<br />Beautiful dress but runs very small. Bust material is rigid, polyester 35%, cotton 65%, with a stretch band waist."
3.0,One of the shirts had deodorant on it like someone had tried it on or wore it?? Kinda gross
3.0,"Wow! These are really cool, soft and silky! Unfortunately the sizing is all wrong for American sizes. This was way too small. I usually wear an XL, but would need a 4 or 6x to be comfortable in this...sending order back, but sure would have liked to keep due to the fabric and the vivid colors!"
3.0,"Hate the Gators, it was a gift... but it was nice"
3.0,One of the gloves had a large hole in it.
3.0,Cute top however tight elastic around the arms
3.0,"Material was definitely cheap and plastic-y. But for the price and the ease to purchase, not the absolute worst. Fit was really boxy so I returned it. If I didn’t order 10 other suits to try on, this would've been fine in a pinch."
3.0,The material is very thin and runs large.
3.0,I did not like that it was so small that I couldn't fasten the choker on my neck.
3.0,The sweater looks beautiful but it's a lot thinner than I thought it would be.
3.0,It looks real it feels real but it’s magnetic and it faded within 2 months but I wore it every day but I have very oily skin
3.0,"Overall we really like this leo, but at the crotch it is too wide, so it bunches up. I plan on narrowing it so it fits a little slimmer."
3.0,I thought it would be thicker.
3.0,"Nice, gave it to my daughter."
3.0,"Dress is beautiful, but bulge in the front makes me want to break down and cry. Dress needs to be altered majorly. Please if you are a curvy women shop around first, before making purpose to avoid paying for alterations after."
3.0,"I was very excited about this, but when i got it i must not have read the height and stuff information because when i got them they were way too big for me, they completely rested on my shoulders and honestly looked kind of funny. I really wish they did fit because they were so beautiful. If you really think that the size will fit for you then you'll love them."
3.0,"I was expecting a different type of fabric, and I did order a size up as the reviews stated. It fits, but its not baggy, which is the way I like my sweatshirts. Its still a really nice sweatshirt, and the design is well printed. For those considering this, it is more of a &#34;slick&#34; silky fabric, not like regular sweatshirt material. More like a track suit.. And definitely order 2 sizes up if you want a loose fit, one size up for a slimmer fit."
3.0,Material feels hot
3.0,BEAUTIFUL Jacket but WAY to small for the size listed. an XL fit more like a Md.
3.0,"Very tight in the armpits, so much so that it will chafe."
3.0,Is a beautiful design but runs very small. I followed the size chart but when it arrived it didn’t fit as well as it should. Order a bigger size
3.0,were cute but broke
3.0,It's beautiful but it came broken. One of the little clasps was undone and the pieces were hanging. It wasn't anything I couldn't fix. The necklace itself is great but I gave it 3 stars because I had to fix it
3.0,Really cute but cheaply made.
3.0,Purchased for my 12yo. Cute but cheaply made. Guess that’s what you get for the price. Took a few weeks to ship (comes from China).
3.0,Way too short.  I for sure can’t wear this to work.  Not sure where to wear it. Not cute enough to wear anywhere but work.
3.0,Cheap made watch. Looks great only
3.0,It’s a cute top. Well made. But I didn’t like the fabric. It’s not a soft touch. More rough material. The size small is very big.
3.0,"The chain seems to be a cheap chain that comes out of quarter toy dispensers, but the pendant is what I actually wanted, so no biggie on that. The letter &#34;y&#34; wasn't fully printed, but it's still cute."
3.0,Really cute and comfy. BUT... this style is best for women without hips.  Not so flattering for hippy girls like me.
3.0,"These looked better on the picture. They were packaged nicely, but were dull and faded."
3.0,Overall the dress is comfortable and somewhat stylish.  However the bright white buttons on the front made it look so cheap.  I purchased new copper toned buttons and it looks much better.<br /><br />fits fine.
3.0,Do not keep my fingers ssfm grip ok
3.0,I realize you get what you pay for but these are so cheaply made i doubt that I will be able to wear them more than once. As soon as I put them on the seams started to split.
3.0,I thought they were adorable! But the glitter started wearing on the toes after her very 1st day of wear. I don't think I'd buy them again
3.0,"Unfortunately, these shirts run a little small for my liking. I ordered it for my daughter in a large and it was still too tight."
3.0,"Did not like this shirt, ended up returning it."
3.0,My favorite part is that they are not see through. The tummy control is kind of non-existant and they roll down. You can move easily in them. For the price they are decent but I wish they had real pockets.
3.0,For my boys.  They came overnight which was a welcome surprise.  Both boys complained of tightness in the toe area.  They cannot be loosened up too much either like you could losen them if they were laced.
3.0,The quality of this looks pretty cheap and it was waaaaaay bigger than expected. Otherwise ok though.
3.0,"These are too long and cheap looking, may be good for the price for some people but not for me."
3.0,The bracelets are what I needed but it is small like for a child. If you have thick wrists/arms these won't fit you.
3.0,Gaudy
3.0,"I like Coolibar products, but this bathing suit did nothing for me.  I am 5'3"" and weigh 135.  Maybe it is right for you.  The color is nice."
3.0,Its ok for the price
3.0,"Extremely long 28 inch inseam. I'm just under 5 ft tall. This is more like a 29 or 30 inch inseam to me, depending on how you measure through the bunches. I was hoping the bunchy adjustable part could keep them from dragging too long. Not even close.<br /><br />This pant is thin ligtweight cool summer type pant. If you are like 5 foot 2, the 28 inseam would probably work well. I'd say the XXL is like a women's size 14 or 16.<br /><br />Please make these in petite short size (26 inseam)."
3.0,This was bigger than I expected and because of that seemed a little cheap. The flower was more yellow than creamy.  It's about 1 1/4&#34; in diameter.  The detail was nice otherwise.
3.0,One fell apart but nice rings
3.0,"The gown is nice overall. Thick material with an inner liner. It can be dressed up or dressed down. I personally liked everything about it, however, I disliked the slit. It was more of a ""U"" than a nice slit that sits well within the fabric with an appealing opening. It could have just been a fluke with my dress, however, I did not like the look due to the slit. Otherwise, everything else fit nicely. Form fitting. Hourglass enhancing. I got the pink and it was a nice deep bubble gum pink. Due to the slit, I'm returning. If the design was better, I would have kept it."
3.0,"Frubi shades are super-cute, functional, affordabe and they fit a wide array of ages (our 2 year old and 5 year old wear them). The foam is flexible and comfortable for the kids, but it just cannot handle being pulled on by kids. Our 2 year old broke a pair within an hour of them arriving. We were able to super-glue them, but they broke in another spot the next time he tugged on them. And our 5 year old broke hers while taking them off the second time she wore them. The foam just isn't that durable! It's a good thing they are cheap! We'll be sticking with our virtually indestructible Julbo sunglasses. While they are more expensive, they can take whatever our 2 year old can throw at them! He's been wearing the same pair daily for over a year!"
3.0,These fit right around the waist but when it hit the thigh it’s suddenly super super tight like a rubber band that’s wrapped around the wrist.
3.0,feathers fell off within a month. they are adorable but can't keep the feathers on them
3.0,Pretty but one of the rhinestones is missing
3.0,Returned. Felt like rayon type tights. Not what I was looking for or expected
3.0,Two out of four came off
3.0,The only reason for 3 stars is that this bag was smaller than i expected..other than that i would have kept it..ballet is a pretty color..material is soft but holds shape
3.0,"So i don’t actually think i can put a photo of me in the top because it might be a bit to risqué, but i mean it’s a swimsuit, that fits kind of. Okay so it’s small, i thought i ordered a medium which would be a size up for me but i guess i clicked large and i am so grateful for my mistake cause the medium might have covered one boob with both covers, but i mean hey i like looking like a whore and this swimsuit does just that so im not complaining to much, one pro i will say, once you tie it and get it on right, it’s not moving, i did like hardcore jumping jacks and she stayed right where she needed so she works, i like her enough<br />34D btw"
3.0,"I had been searching for glasses online and came across these.  Great price.  Nice material, but they are too oversized.  If you wear a bifocal lens, it will cause you to have to push your glasses up higher than you probably wear them to keep from having that room moving effect as you turn your head<br /><br />The glasses themselves are nice, lightweight and unique"
3.0,I love this ring. I'm glad I know how to fix this but not everyone can. I think the makers need to add a bit more to the holder so the stone does not fall out.
3.0,used it for a year and the strap broke. Expected it to last longer. Just used it inside the house.
3.0,Makes me look fatter hen I am because it’s body Hu gging with no liner
3.0,Really upset that they color is more of a blue color then it is a hunter green. It looks like a aqua color not a green. A great shirt really comfortable will order more in other colors
3.0,"This garment has not a single tag, so apparently Amazon in not required to adhere to US garment laws. The neck is uncomfortably tight.  Prolly half the price on AliExpress. Would not buy again"
3.0,Depending on the size of your feet they may be tight. I wear a size 11 and could just barely get my foot in. Would not have bought if known they were going to fit like this. A sizing chart from the company would have been nice.
3.0,"I'm very short, 110lbs ordered the medium, just a little long in the neck, but the print totally makes up for it"
3.0,It's super cute but quite large and doesn't fit smaller keys. Should work for an older car key (not fob). I figure I'll have to get a rubber circle or other type key cover for the keys I wanted to use this for.
3.0,"My daughter loves rainbows and puppies so this dress was a winner in her book.<br /><br />She doesn't care, but one particular puppy is printed multiple times with a blue dot on its  forehead and it bugs me"
3.0,"My chest measures 43”, I bought a large based on the size table.  Fits perfectly in the body but arms are very tight - this is definitely not sized to be an overshirt over anything other than a T-shirt.<br />It is also much scratchier than other merino clothing I have but it doesn’t me.<br />Also was extremely disappointed to find this shirt was made in china, pics of tags in the listing made it seem like it was made in USA - that’s a pet peeve of mine, I hate when companies aren’t upfront and honest about where their products are made.<br />Overall it’s not a horrible shirt, but it’s not anything to write home about either.  With hindsight being 20/20 I would have opted for another product instead of this one and would return it but I have already worn it (trying to convince myself I liked it) so I can’t really return it."
3.0,"Nice ring, but sizing is off. Can’t wear it, way too big."
3.0,Neck too open & wide
3.0,Got this for my husband on his 3rd time using the mask one of the ear loops broke we sewed it back together other than that it’s a great product my husband loves it big Star Wars and snoopy fan
3.0,The crystals keep coming off
3.0,"They do the trick, definitely hide the piercings. On the cheap side, but expected as much, and they seem to be irregular in length, some being a bit longer than 5/16."
3.0,"This is very pretty and probably one of my favorite earrings while it lasted, the ball stripped out from just normal wear and tear, I don’t fiddle with them or do any contact sports or anything in them, and lost the ball and after that every replacement ball only lasts a couple of weeks before it too gets lost. So unfortunately, this beauty has been retired just for looks now"
3.0,Solid quality and looks great. But i needed a .5” pin as advertised for a project but the pin is actually .76”.
3.0,Very pretty and feminine but there's simply no room for large breasts.
3.0,"Definitely not narrow, unless your head is the size of a basketball. Decent quality, but hardly &#34;narrow&#34;."
3.0,Did not flatter my figure and very little tummy control
3.0,not my favorite material
3.0,"Flimsier than I expected, but son still loved it."
3.0,"It's pretty effective at keeping your face warm. Unfortunately it's hard to get it to stay put, and hard to wear glasses simultaneously."
3.0,...
3.0,Nice quality but the musical symbols are upside down. Drives musicians crazy.
3.0,It's a little short and runs on the baggy side. Not fitted. The material gets pilly after one wash
3.0,You get what you pay for.  These aren't anything special.  Simply pop beads.  No more to say for your 15 word requirement.
3.0,The product shipped quickly and arrived as expected however this will be the 3rd time we ordered it. The sizes are rediculously small my husband wears a U.S. Medium now I’ve had to order a triple XXXL for him.  Maybe they could let us know it runs very small.
3.0,The suit seemed to be of good material and lined well. I loved the color. I have a big chest and that part looked ridiculous all squished in like a sausage with skin popping out. Fit great everywhere else but had to return. Nice suit though.
3.0,Very cute but the fit ran small
3.0,the top itself & quality are very nice but it runs extremely small so be weary :)
3.0,The fit was fine. The super thin material was a total disappointment. Why would I buy a thin long sleeve shirt? No reason at all. Was supposed to help get through winter. No dice there.
3.0,Broke down
3.0,"Not exactly &#34;cat eye&#34; stones, less flashy in person, took almost a month to be delivered, but cute for the price I paid."
3.0,"Ladies this dress is lovely please order your exact size when ordering this dress there is no need to go a size up , the hemming seemed a bit off however it's an  overall lovely gown."
3.0,I find these bracket for the face a small.
3.0,"The last button stops well above the belly button, literally like right below the breast line (where my index finger is, on the second pic). The shirt gapes open when tied, because their should clearly be like 2 more buttons on this shirt, but there isn’t. The shirt itself is cute, but the manufacturing is dumb. I don’t know who thought this shirt was okay, with the buttons stopping where they do. Prepare to have to safety pin the shirt closed, as you can see from my pics; I pinned it, but you can still clearly see that the shirt is open"
3.0,It was okay.  Looked a little cheap - and had to glue back on couple of the pieces.
3.0,"These are great gloves. The reason for the low rating is that the package is ONLY 6 PAIR, not 12 pair as described.<br />Customer Service was quick to resolve the issue.<br />The thumb doesn’t flip open just in case you were looking for that detail."
3.0,"These are comfortable and fit great. The only issue is strap  that buckles around the ankle. They pucker out as you walk, like the strap is coming undone. I have Velcro so I'll use that to modify the strap so it stays down."
3.0,"Sandals are good quality, from what I can see, and fit as expected.  However,  the strap across the toes caused pressure that was painful at the widest part of my foot. I'm sure it has a lot to do with my foot and wouldn't do this for everyone, especially since I only had pain with my left foot and not the right (all my problems seem to be left foot). Cute sandals, but won't work for me.  Sending back."
3.0,"Pretty happy with the necklaces so far, but wat im not happy about was that my phone number was printed on the outside of the package for anyone to see. I will NOT be ordering from this seller again b.c of this"
3.0,"I’m 5’9” 125 lbs and lanky. I bought a small. I do not have hips so I am swimming in the bottom of this dress. Which is a shame because the material was nice, great packaging. Just made for a woman with larger hips & buttox than I have."
3.0,Not the compression as stated
3.0,"beautiful product, but my &#34;new&#34; item had someone else's monogram on it LOL. I didnt want to deal with going to the post office to resend, wait for another, etc. so I just kept it :)"
3.0,I'm disappointed that it is much shorter than in the picture.  Looks like it will just be a house dress.
3.0,"I like these tank tops, Unfortunately, you have to order three sizes larger than you actually wear due to the fact they're not in US sizes."
3.0,The buckle comes undone easily.
3.0,Cheap plastic jewelry. Broke days after opening. It’s cute and exactly what I expected.
3.0,Isn’t comfortable at all. Really long but arms are tight. Isn’t correct in sizing. I’m usually a large. Bought an XL and still wasn’t right
3.0,Cute earrings but two of the balls were missing from one of the earrings. I had a jeweler turn the bell around so the missing bart is in the back and won’t be noticed. They were very inexpensive so not worth returning.
3.0,I expected if would have a softer feel.  The medium size was more like a plus.
3.0,Very cute but way too small!
3.0,"I ordered a large, fit like a small"
3.0,"It's a nice fashion accessory. With delivery added, it's a little more than I expected, but nice."
3.0,Pants fit perfect jacket is a different story
3.0,It's ok.  It's what I expected.
3.0,"Very pretty.  Purple is one of my favorite colors.  I ordered this set bcuz I like to have an entire matching set like this.<br />While these pieces are oretty, I only gave them 3 stars bcuz they are not the same quality jewelry ads my Qiance & bamoer pieces.  But they are fine for casual days."
3.0,very stiff
3.0,The center stone is pretty but too large. Could you make them more in the 1.5 ct. size?
3.0,"This is my first pair of Brooks Running Socks. They're not great. They feel fine, but during a run they don't hold on my feet well. They slide down on my feet. These are my back-up socks and not my primary running socks. The L and R seem weird as well as the lip at the top of the ankle. Won't buy these again."
3.0,the low part was made out of a different material than the shirt but she looked super in it once we embellished it for her costume
3.0,The track suit is nice but my cousin  and I ordered the same one and we both have different materials. I was expecting the fabric material she received but it still fit as it should.
3.0,"Very bulky, good if you are looking for that"
3.0,I'm not sure yet as I haven't started the repair yet.  The sole supplies are big enough to fix sasquatch 's shoes so i'm sure I'll have to cut them way down.  I'll update.
3.0,It is not bad for the price though.
3.0,A lot thinner than I thought it would be though.
3.0,It is a nice concept belt however getting it fastened is bit of a trick.  I usually wear a 1X or XL belt and this one was a bit to snug for my taste.
3.0,Beautiful but they broke easily!
3.0,I ordered the one with the mesh top. I ordered a size L and received a Large top and SMALL bottom. Top is SUPER cute and luckily I can pair it with a different bottom so I am keeping it.
3.0,I really like this necklace the only thing is it doesn't look as rose gold pink in person.
3.0,"So I bought this product in my size, which is a xlarge. Which all ways round, was a horrible idea! It was extremely large! It was poorly put together, and the pads slip down to under my breast... Nope, nope, nope! Not worth the money."
3.0,Beautiful dress to small had to give it away
3.0,"This product heats up quickly. You need to provide a power source such as an external battery ( NOT INCLUDED) but that’s not a big deal- the problem I was having was that it’s quite small. It must be Asian sizing . So order up ALOT! Otherwise it is comfortable, has different warming levels and Kees me warm in the cold mornings when walking."
3.0,Shiny fabric. A little weird in the bust area.
3.0,They were very heavy
3.0,It was too thin for me.
3.0,"It’s a nice shirt, good warmth and style.  Delivered quickly and in good shape.  Only advise to check the size chart and possibly go up one or two sizes from your normal size for the best fit."
3.0,"I ordered the proper size, but these are so short in length they hardly reach my bicep if I use the thumb hole. I own many many pairs of arm warmers so I have a lot of experience. Quality & material seems high, but sizing seems too short."
3.0,Pretty but fits very small
3.0,I bought this bracelet for myself and I loved it. So cute and fit perfectly even though I do have small ankles. however it did not hold up at all the quality was very disappointing. I wore it for about four weeks and the metal connectors started to pop out I reattached two to three times until finally one of the two chains just broke and I had to throw it away. no worth the money and disappointed in the making of this bracelet.<br /><br />The shipping and packaging was very cute!
3.0,No small adjustments on the watch.
3.0,I actually love this top but it is in no imaginable way a compression top as it is listed. It is a great layer for wicking sweat and fits nicely.
3.0,"My wife's review - I am 5'5&#34; and 135 lbs and ordered a medium.  The top half fit well, but below the faux belt it &#34;poofed&#34; out a bit in a way that didn't look very flattering on me.  The zipper is up the back.  Bottom half is fairly heavy polyester fabric, which made it a bit uncomfortable."
3.0,"This is just an ok bracelet. It could have been better even though the price is quite reasonable.  The key issue is the construction quality which isn't great.<br /><br />I'd say that it is good for kids to use.<br /><br />The lock mechanism offers some flexibility of length which is a good thing.  The colors are also nice and the gold looks quite good. It's decent looking overall.<br /><br />The links between metal cuboids appear fragile and looks like they would break easily even with moderate use.  Tried wearing it through the day and it's not the most comfortable either as the metal encasements with sharp edges caused a bit of discomfort while wearing.  So they can't be worn for a long time.<br /><br />Overall, its decent value for money, though you can certainly find better quality in this price"
3.0,Dress style very nice. Fabric not so nice. Sewing good
3.0,Disliked the fact that this dress had no stretch. The style of this dress was great.
3.0,"Panties was a lil too small, but overall fits ok. Next time I'll order the next size up"
3.0,It’s very hot inside the mask. I cut out sections to create some air flow.
3.0,It's a good race that is very good looking but we'll just a little bit small for my wrist other than that it's a good bracelet
3.0,Arms too short for taller person and appears cheaply looking.
3.0,"This shirt resembles linen, but it’s actually cotton, it’s an ok shirt. This shirt feels cheap, not like linen at all.<br /><br />True to size, light and airy, it’s on the thin side so you can see through the shirt. It is easy to wash. I recommend hand washing although it does say machine washable. It wrinkles easily.<br /><br />Overall, it’s an ok shirt. This color is light blue and has a different pin stripe pattern than the description photo."
3.0,Great box to start. Then the felt lining inside of the box started to peel apart. Cheaply made
3.0,Nice shirt to large
3.0,Let me start off by saying that outfit is darling and is well made and good fabric but I was disappointed with the dullness in the color of the clothes is not bright like the picture shows matter fact I had to go back and look to see what I had ordered and match them up the clothes wasn't bright at all they were dull but if they look like the picture they would have been beautiful
3.0,"I found these to be &#34;hot&#34; and a bit too stretchy and made of thin material, not very impressed with the quality. The colors are cool and they are fun and inexpensive, but I would have rather bought a few of a better quality product."
3.0,"It's really pretty and light weight but the pom poms are not secured properly, so they started falling off as soon as I put it on."
3.0,Poorly tailored.
3.0,"I was hoping these felt a little more cotton-y, but they do fit well."
3.0,"These pants were fabulous out of package. Washed very carefully in cold water and hung to dry. Did the same thing again. Third wash, I ""fluffed"" pants in dryer and hung out to dry. Now, 1.2 to 2 inches shorter in legs, and tighter all around. Not as nice. So, beware. This fabric does not say it is pre shrunk. Obviously it is not pre shrunk. Have not had any other clothing shrink like this .... wanted to buy a second pair, but not sure now."
3.0,this is a beautiful piece of jewelry but breaks very easily. one of the lines of jewels detached from the entire thing 5 minutes into wearing it. becare and carry around pliers if you buy!
3.0,There nice.
3.0,"They are very pretty, and true to the photos. However, the snap backs don't seem very sturdy in craftsmanship. I worry about losing these earrings whenever I wear them."
3.0,Very cute but not very well put together. Took it out of the package and one eye on each reindeer came off.
3.0,"I bought these in November and they have been fantastic for the past 5-6 months I've had them. However today, I wore them out sailing and got them very wet for a few hours, as conditions were pretty rough. When I took them off I found that the polarized coating was flaking off quite badly as you can see in my first picture. They were originally a solid reflective blue as shown in my second picture (taken just 2 days ago) and there's now very little blue left. They were great beforehand and for the price I paid I can't complain too much, but keep this in mind if you are going to be out on the ocean in these glasses and keep them for poolside/driving only."
3.0,These run in the large size and the padding is to large and thick you can barely walk in the shorts. I retuned for smaller size and still found them to big. I'm now returning the smaller ones as I found pair at bike store that work perfect.
3.0,They came in broken.
3.0,Was made with thin material
3.0,All the faces are basically the same.  Just the top symbol is different
3.0,This ring tarnished really bad within two weeks and finish is coming off
3.0,"I just can't seem to get it right with Shimano.  My feet measure close to a US size 11, which usually works for me if there is a 'wide' option available. Normally, I wear an 11.5 in tennis shoes.<br /> I have a pair of Shimano road shoes which I ordered in size 46. According to the shimano size conversion, their 46 is equivalent to a US 11.3, so I figured it would be a perfect fit. The 46 actually felt somewhat large, and I could fit two fingers behind my heel. So with this pair I decided to try a 45 because I prefer a more snug fit. This time my toes felt too crammed. Had to send back.  I went with the Giro in 45 and they're a perfect fit."
3.0,It was way too small.  I had to send it back
3.0,"Bonitas y comodas ,preferible para pies anchos"
3.0,Fits pretty tight and is VERY thick fabric. Would be ideal to wear during a snowstorm in Buffalo and still look fashionable. But I kind of doubt I will wear this very often.
3.0,Love it my niece loved it too she wears it everyday and has not tarnished yet !
3.0,Bought it for my 6yr old son because I though the sizing read as under 15yrs. It is very small. I'd say it's for under 4yrs.
3.0,"My daughter is just now fitting into the 0-3 months size at 3 months. They definitely run large, and the legs are pretty wide. The fabric feels really nice, but everytime I go to undo the snaps it feels like it's going to rip because the snaps are so strong and the fabric is thin. I wish the snaps would undo a little easier, because it's nice not to have a heavy pajama and I love the prints!"
3.0,Just ok looks better in photo
3.0,Dress runs large....  Very cute but I would order I size down
3.0,Nice necklace if you don't mind having to untangle it a million times.
3.0,I thought it looked great however it rubbed on the back of my neck constantly and I just couldn't deal with it. I gifted it to a friend and they look incredible in it.
3.0,I wasn't super crazy about these leggings the pictures makes it look like it's white inbetween the pattern but it's a ivory weird color not so flattering. Or so I think anyways. They fit but they are pretty tight for a one size fits all.
3.0,"I love the Charm & the Chain is good quality However the Small metal piece that connects the Charm to the chain is cheap and the Next day it Came apart & The Charm fell off. That piece of metal is Cheaply made, not fastened well enough and literally is the piece that takes away from the quality of the overall necklace. Shame because I really liked this jewlery. I bought in recognition of my loved one who passed from Cancer earlier this month."
3.0,Material cheap. Close fitting. I wear 3x pear shape hips 49-51 bust 36DDD  5 8” 257lbs
3.0,"Runs small and not very sturdy. My finger went through the thin mesh on the 1st time putting it on, now it has holes in the side."
3.0,These pants are being sold as a professional basic. That is not my experience. There are yoga pants with back pockets. They are very comfortable and the stretch is nice. They are not a substitute for trousers.
3.0,"They are pretty, but they are also much smaller than shown.  I liked the color variety which is why I bought them.  And although I don't want big sized carat studs, these could have been alittle larger.  I would guess they are slightly bigger than 1/4 a carat, but certainly not a 1/2 a carat."
3.0,on own a bunch CASIO’s  this one does the job looks great just a little too cheap.
3.0,The material is very soft and perfect for hot days & nights.<br />I found the fit very baggy and not very flattering
3.0,"My first impression was pretty horrible because it was shipped in an envelope instead of a box and arrived really crushed and wrinkled. Thankfully I was able to pop it back into shape and it worked out well for my 4 year old's Zorro costume. He loved it and it was of an okay quality that it worked for his costume and I could reshape it after it was crushed, but the seller definitely needs to work on their shipping and packaging choices."
3.0,"This purse is pretty standard issue. It looks nice and stays closed. You can use with or without the chain shoulder strap. I bought this ""Black Patent Leather"" purse to go with a pair of Black Patent Leather shoes. They were NOT the same.  The purse has a deep embedded ""GLITTERY/DIRTY"" look about it and doesn't match other patent leather items (shoes, belts and headband) I've already purchased. Beware!"
3.0,"I normally wear a L in tops and XL in Patty. This jacket is much thinner than I expected. It is more like a t-shirt weight. I had hoped it would be thicker and not show all the lines of my clothing and imperfections underneath, but that isn't the case. But the major flaw is that the fabric at the pockets where the zipper is stitched in gets stuck in the zipper. I don't know if this is a defect only on mine, but it seems like it could be a problem on every jacket due to the design. I don't know if I like the jacket enough to exchange it to find out. I do like the shape and length - it is pretty much everything I wanted except for the fabric weight. It's not worth the $50 I paid."
3.0,"This dress was way too large!  It was cute and very well constructed though I must say, that is why I gave it 3 stars.  Beautiful color green.  I ordered a medium taking into account the reviews.  Just for reference,  I am 143 lbs, 5'6 and a 38C.  This dress was super loose and to my knees!  I wanted something that clung to me and was very short and flirty.  I would definitely say this dress runs big.  I had to give it to my cousin.  She looks great in it."
3.0,These boots are cute but not very well made.  The strap is really flimsy and looks cheap but I only paid 10.00 for them so I got what I paid for.
3.0,Looks sharp. My son loves the suite. It runs big. The pants are way to long. Will need to be hemmed and my son is in the 98th percentile for height.
3.0,"Way bigger than other XS of the same brand. Huge chunks of fabric hanging off my arms, not even close to fitting around the waist. Soft and stretchy, but not good for anyone needing a smaller size."
3.0,"I loved this top - it looked great, fit good, and felt nice - BUT the print color ruined it ... it's a really dull shade of gray - bleh"
3.0,"Much bigger than I expected and the folds hide most of the design. Obviously when they are on and you are wearing it, it's pulled apart more, so you can see more of the design, but I just overall really don't like the look of these or the feel on my face."
3.0,Cute dress but tight in the arms. Make sure you don’t have to lift your arms up when you wear it
3.0,I definitely liked the pictures of the dress better than I liked it in person. It's a cute dress just not exactly what I wanted.
3.0,"This chain, while nice and big and sturdy, is not my style. I thought there were three options in the order, a small medium and large.  But after receiving it and inspecting my order further, I actually ordered the wrong one. Such is the way of the Vine, but I digress.<br /><br />Preparing for a Christmas party, it occurred to me that I could really enhance my Christmas suit with a mock turtleneck and chain! In a flash, I was Philly and NYC rolled into one!<br /><br />I actually like the chain - for what it is. I would never wear something like this on a normal day so to have it in my arsenal of party going goofs and spoofs and gags - this fits right in!<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this chain to my friends and relatives who wanted one for a specific purpose, like a costume party, other than wanting a nice cuban link chain, and rate it three stars."
3.0,If only it had been the proper size to button. Cut way too small for the size. Very disappointing.
3.0,"We took measures, but it was smaller. we should have bought a bigger size"
3.0,Love the print however the weave has some irregularities in it...like something you would expect as a “second quality” product. Hence a three versus a five star rating. Fits a little big.
3.0,"Definitely an attention getter, but the largest, bottom 'feather' doesn't lay properly and I'm always fidgeting with it to turn it right side forward.  Looks like it was assembled backwards, but not a big enough issue for me to return it."
3.0,"The print is pretty, but it is not a sweatshirt. As others mentioned, it is a long sleeved t-shirt with a small crew neck opening. I am still able to wear it as a normal long sleeved t, but I ordered it with the impression that it was a sweatshirt. There are some loose strings on mine, but I have seen worse. It did appear really small when I pulled it out of the package and I was honestly surprised that it fit me. I'm pretty short though. I would definitely not recommend this for someone with longer arms."
3.0,Smaller then I thought but still awesome.  Went to the wrong address but found it's way to me.
3.0,2nd pair of these I have purchased as gifts...both times they were 1-1.5 sizes too big (even though ordered in correct size).  Cute and well made but beware of extremely large sizing! My granddaughter will hold onto them until next spring when they will hopefully fit her.
3.0,"I brought a 4x & I’m usually a Large, it fit but it wasn’t as snug as I wanted it..."
3.0,Lasted about 16 months before it broke. The locking spring mechanism snapped in half.
3.0,"Small for a man's watch.  Appears not to be adjustable re: wrist size.  I have a very thin wrist, and it just fit."
3.0,This product was great in quality but was slightly big. I ordered what I thought was light pink but when it came it was hot pink which I was not expecting but I will still wear it.
3.0,"Too Big or something fell off while running, and I don't have a small head"
3.0,xmas gift seemed well made
3.0,It's not as thick as expected. Definitely size up.
3.0,"One of the gems was missing from the bracelet. I ordered 2, one was perfect and the other was not."
3.0,"Quality is good, but just didn't think it was actually 2 left sides 😅"
3.0,"Bought this to display, however it could have been made better, and for what it is and the price it was an alright deal.<br /><br />First thing i noticed about it was the embossed AEW logo on the belt was upside down from  the championship plates on it. fortunatly for how i am going to display it so this was not a big issue.<br /><br />Secondly inside of 24 hours of having recieved this belt one of the snaps that would hold the belt on, should you choose to wear it had popped off and I am unsure of how to get it reattatched but again not a major issue because i am going to display it.<br /><br />However if i had any intentions of taking the belt anywhere or wearing it these would become some major issues and possibly decrease my overall / individual ratings of this AEW championship belt."
3.0,Ordered a size small and it’s pretty loose. ( how I wanted) the colors aren’t the exact same as the pic but it’s still cute.
3.0,Did not receive the colors pictured - just be aware if you are looking for a specific color!
3.0,Was not satisfied with this one.
3.0,"Bought the extra large, too small. I wear a 12 usually. I liked the dress though..."
3.0,"It's very pretty, fabric is soft, but I'm giving three stars because when it arrived there was a hole in the torso that I had to repair."
3.0,Not lightweight. ok product
3.0,"got large , could not zipp it up so it hit the trash , looked like it was made ok , I am average size for an American . so if I ever purchased another  it would be 2xx  or 3xxx and not just large in men's size  .  If I could get cold weather gear here I would have not mail ordered something so important to health ."
3.0,I’m usually a medium. I ordered a large and it was too tight. Thin material but good for summer. Came with what looked like a belt that was too short but then I realized it’s a tie to loop around the ruched fabric across the waist.  I will reorder the xl because it’s very cute.  The light blue is a grayish blue.
3.0,"The top was loved by my granddaughter but the skirt, in pictures I was sent, looked a little big and sloppy<br />not a full skirt like order looked and was long considering my 3 year old granddaughter is tall for her age.<br />Would not work for an Easter church outfit at all but will make a play outfit just fine. Get what you pay for I guess."
3.0,I think it is a great looking shoe.  I didn't like how much of a point the toe came to so i returned it.
3.0,Material is super thin not soft and runs small
3.0,I'm only giving it 3 stars because it is really too early for me to determine what benefits I'm receiving. I don't really feel anything when I wear it over than a tight shirt not similar to a man's spanks top. The sizing chart is different between Amazon and AlignMed. On Amazon it was suggested that I get an xl but that proved to be too big. I called AlignMed and they suggested the large which seems to fit fine. Unfortunately because I bought it on Amazon I had to purchase another one and return the other. I don't feel the burn or heat described. As mentioned I will try this for a while before I make a determination on the benefits.It looks to be a of good quality.
3.0,Worked fine for about three uses and then the adhesive started bubbling up and eventually fell off.  Disappointed in this product versus adhesive bras I have purchased from Amazon in the past.
3.0,This pair was not quite as described - smaller than all others sold on the market.  My grandchildren have not played with them and it became necessary to purchase a different item sold in stores.
3.0,Definitely will not work for heavier chest. Not a deports bra. More of a tank that’s padded. Runs small. Doesn’t offer support. Would not recommend to work out in.
3.0,"This product is very nice! I would recommend but also has room for improvement on build. I purchased two of these and both have broken. The first, the slack holder ripped and eventually fell off. Now the second has broken where the metal clip attaches to the watch. One of the screws has stripped out and I cannot get it to tighten back up."
3.0,Looks good on my Pandora bracelet.
3.0,after a year they turned into a weird copper color
3.0,"Cute dress, but loops on the dress ripped during my first wear (so  negative on quality).  The style is nice.  Length is about mid thigh in front, but longer in back on my 5'4 frame.  Can't wear the dress opened like the model unless you want your bra showing.  I was able to tie it closed and make the loop cover the opening. Overall is okay, but not great.  Required a lot of ironing before wearing."
3.0,Too small had to return.  Pretty dress though.
3.0,"A clever idea, but two problems: it barely fits over my husband’s big head, and it certainly is a pain in the butt to store."
3.0,"For the price I can not complain, I love Disney and the little mermaid:) I have not been in the pool get with this, really got it for fun and if I enjoy I will get a better made one. This one is actually just to see before spending more. I am 6ft tall and it fits ok. Reason for 3 stars is because it's just not one of your daily swim ones, but it is cute, mine seems well made and if anything I will take some cute pictures!"
3.0,Was listed as a regular fit and it is a plus size!! I'm very small so it's too big
3.0,"The print of the dress is so cute, but the material is so cheap… it’s not soft at all, almost feels like a super thing windbreaker material."
3.0,Bought this for my boys right before school started especially for my youngest starting kindergarten. Was a good thought but they told me once tightened it would always come undone throughout the day so they just put it in backpack. Loved the idea just wish it stayed.
3.0,"Glad it came with 6, since they're flimsy and will definitely snap with a light tug. Still, they're cute, and for the price, I can't really complain."
3.0,It's a little see through. Especially the bra. I use training jacket always to make it not weird.
3.0,I'm 5'4 and 152 lbs these are pretty sheer on me.
3.0,"It's a nice shirt, but way over priced! It's very thin and you must buy bigger! My son is 3yrs old and he fit nicely in a size 6. I bought this for a monster truck show, so I only paid the $21.99 as I didn't want to go through the hassle of going to every store to look a monster truck shirt. My son loves it though. I wouldn't have paid this amount had I seen it in person."
3.0,"I bought the orange/white one and the print is beautiful and material is super soft and comfy. However, not for large chested folks. I wear a size 14 and I got the XL, but the sleeves were too tight for my arms and the top looked awful over my 38DDD chest. If you are smaller on top, I'd say go for it. The dress is super cute."
3.0,"it's okay,  barely.  it's really REALLY teeny tiny petite - stones are like small lil' rhinestone from the drug store  lo  it's okay but very tiny stones.  :(  kinda bummed out.  but i am wearing it,  adds just a hint of bling,  lol  NOT AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE THOUGH so i added it with another bling type bracelet,  had too. for teeny stones they are pretty - with a magnifying glass,  :p  ... (and this is David's step-mom,  not him)  lol"
3.0,I thought this piece of jewelry was really nice and cute. It def doesn’t fit as a nose piercing at all. The Bar barely goes through your nose. I was really disappointed.
3.0,I bought a normal size for me. The dress was very fitted and too small for me. Nice color
3.0,"These laces took over a month to arrive, they were expensive and didn't work"
3.0,I didn't have high expectations so I wasn't disappointed. The only thing I don't like is how the t-shirt sits on my shoulders. It's like I always have to pull the t-shirt down and adjust it because after a couple of washes the design sort of sticks to itself it's wonky. Will never lay flat again.
3.0,Comfortable but too big and baggy. Ordered normal size
3.0,Only good for casual wear.  They offer minimal support for hiking.
3.0,Too heavy - I should have bought the plastic one
3.0,Fits small try to order 2 sizes up.
3.0,Not an ideal value compared to other costume-jewelry shipped from China.
3.0,"These held the twins for a minute.  While I rushed to get ready I became a little glistened and this began to slide 🤔 Needless to say I was disappointed.  I used some body tape to support the sides and cooled down. Then it was supporting me and worked well with my backless, sideless, amazingly sexy gown.<br />❤️💙"
3.0,"Quality seems good and the color was pretty. I likes that they don’t have a fluffy lining.  If you can wear slip ons these might be what you are looking for.<br />But they aren’t for me. From the picture I thought there was a deeper rise on the heal. My foot kept sliding out, I need something against my heel. I’m returning them."
3.0,This is a gift & the size was wrong.
3.0,"I think the size fits as expected, which was really nice. They are accurate to the Demon Slayer show which I lOVE. However they are HORRIBLE to walk in. What would make this product better is better straps for the back that will make them stay in place. I also loved how they came with the black socks."
3.0,"Meh, I just wasn’t jazzed about how this fit, and I wouldn’t call it cute. Maybe it’s for lounging at home? I have a curvy figure and while the size was fine the fabric is cheap and the cut is not well thought out. It will be great for laundry day or errands but not outside the house."
3.0,"I currently have a pair of swimming shorts from this brand, and I really love them.  We took them to the beach and I had no issues with them being uncomfortable or being too thin.  These ones seem very thin and with the color I am worried they will be see through when wet.  I will still try them out when the weather changes (will update).  They also just feel to fit a little differently than my other pair."
3.0,Shorts a little tight one me. I ordered the medium and I’m 5’8” 145 pounds. Shirt fits good. Not a fan of the print up close it looks like its been washed a million times. Cute though overall.
3.0,"Wanted for an easy to wear summer dress. However, the cut is meant only for thin figure; no room for a few extra pounds.  Delightful print and light, summery fabric."
3.0,Very cute but somewhat small! Quality is a little less than expected.
3.0,"Not really a boot more like indoor outdoor house shoe slipper boot, for that use was okay + I bought them on sale."
3.0,I like the quality of this bag including the sturdy straps. It's just not very comfortable material on my back or when I wear it on my shoulder.
3.0,"These aren’t worth the price.  They are just like the things I get in stores, just cost more!!!"
3.0,"Smaller than anticipated, does not fit a standard chain. Had to rearrange a lot to get it on my current necklace, but seems to be holding up fine. Corners aren't sharp like some larger ones, is super unobtrusive."
3.0,"I like this dress, but I had to return it bcos it was too small on me. Very tight fitting although it was so pretty. I will have to choose a medium next time I buy it."
3.0,Pretty but overall small. It also wouldn’t lay flat and the CZ stone flips and faces inward. The stone is also sharp on the backside. Would have kept though if it fit better.
3.0,It fit a little smaller than I expected.<br />Glad I ordered a size bigger than normal.
3.0,I'm returning this as I'm sure my son would have it ripped in the first 20 mins.  The fabric is so thin.
3.0,"It's bulky and the straps are impossibly annoying. You can't tuck them out of the way anywhere. Unfortunately, this vest is only suitable if you are staying at home. The chill factor is great, though, and feels great on your back and shoulders. I didn't notice weight change from this, but do believe in the science behind it. I just couldn't deal with the straps and how bulky it was long enough to really test the weight loss theory behind it. However, if it's hot outside, this would be great for cooling you down while you had to be in the heat... I really wish the design was a little different on it so that I could wear it in public. There were no options for a female vest in another design at the time of my purchase of this item or at the time that I returned this product. Now, months later, I still see no other options for me. That's a pity, but I'll keep checking periodically to hopefully find a better vest design for women."
3.0,"Not completely what I was expecting, 2/3 pieces are unusable but workable for my gifts.<br />Thank you 😊"
3.0,"So disappointing that it didn't fit. It was super cute, seemed well made, my daughter loved it, and it was huge! Return was very easy."
3.0,"Material too thin, and color not as white!"
3.0,Nice colors and fits exactly. Shrinks after washing
3.0,The mask looks nice but runs a little small.
3.0,It works but I’m not sure how much I trust it.
3.0,Looked to cheap
3.0,"Very cute, but material is pretty thin."
3.0,XL is too small for size 16/18 person. XxL was grayed out. The rainbow isn’t as cute in person. It’s like a fabric piece is attached.
3.0,Ordered a size up and they’re still on the small size.  Keeping them because I’m still on a fitness journey.
3.0,"These look very cute, but fit very small. I had to return the first ones and reordered a larger size, and even they fit snug. They are super thin too so you can see through them easily."
3.0,I like these shirts! Very comfortable and warm. Giving 3 stars only because after I washed one of the shirts one time I noticed a small rip at the seem by the shoulder.
3.0,Initially I would have given this ring 5 stars but I'm glad I waited to use it for more than 2 weeks because at 1st it was a great fit and feel but after some time I noticed it kept getting too expanded on my finger just from every day normal activities. Even brushing my hair would cause it to stretch out and I constantly have to tighten it around my fi nger. Not to mention how many times I scratched my face with the little leaf part the initial is on since they made it almost like an arrow. The ring is beautiful just poorly designed unfortunately. I would recommend if youre going to wear it here and there not as an everyday thing
3.0,"It doesn’t look as advertised. Go larger in size for a baggier fit, also none of the colors are heathered and all solid colors. The neckline is a bit awkward and sits a bit odd. I’ll add a picture later."
3.0,"Very cute and high quality, but it's too small. I bought a size 3 for my daughter who just turned 3 and is by all means average sized, and it's too small and too tight on her."
3.0,Cute but shorts were sized too small
3.0,The lowest quslity
3.0,Not the same as the Pic...bummer!!!
3.0,"Nice and compact even with five cards inserted, but it gets bulky after five cards and some paper cuurecy. However its good for a night in town or quick mini vacation get away."
3.0,Pros - Work as advertised.<br />  Warmth right to the tip on her fingers.<br />  The charge appears to last with plenty of charge left.<br /><br />Cons - No instructions were included. Was not able to get them to work until I emailed the company.<br />  Then I only got the one answer as to how to turn them on. No more instructions.<br />  Extremely difficult to fit batteries into glove pocket.<br />  The wires are bend very tight and appear to be at high risk of breaking over time.<br />  Gloves (liners) do not produce enough warmth to be worn alone. You must use an exterior glove.
3.0,Thin and doesnt meet standards. Cute.
3.0,"I was really excited for the attipas for my 5 month old but since first time he used start loosing treads, now have a used and old looking"
3.0,Very cute shoe but the clicker that lights the shoe up will not stay concealed.
3.0,I gave this 3 stars only because my response to the seller was quick.  This L is really as small.  For the price and time I waited wasnt too impressed.
3.0,"They definitely run small.  I typically wear a size 9.5-10, and I ordered a 10.  My toes just touch the end. I wish they had a size 11 because these are super cute boots."
3.0,It’s a little too big but otherwise good quality.
3.0,"Doesn't work properly unless there is exactly 6 cards inside. With four or five cards the mechanism jams and/or does not properly eject cards. I like the finish of it and with six cards it works well most of the time, so I think it deserves three stars."
3.0,"Beautiful, but I have very sensitive skin which it made my ear red and itchy still love though!🙂"
3.0,"we shall see over time how the coil bands hold up, but for now they are serving their purchase"
3.0,"I wanted a check book cover that I could use with some cards, no go, no checks fit when just partially full with cards."
3.0,Stone was good quality but necklace and fairy charm were not.
3.0,"For the quality, this really shouldn't be ten dollars. For the style and flower pattern yes, but the quality is what makes the price. I will say, however. My favorite part is how it is, it's a perfect length in the front, not Corp top short, and not long, just right, and it bridges to the back and becomes a little long, hiding the butt. So the way that sits is beautiful. The pics are probably difficult to tell because it came very wrinkly, but when I steam iron it, I know it'll be beautiful. I'm planning to wear it to church, so that hiding the butt area is a super plus👌🏻 I wear a size medium in shirts and smalls fit too, and this shirt does not fit me bad. The idea of these baby doll shirts is flow, and you definitely capture that essence with this shirt and fit. The sleeve area is just right too, not small. Not big. In the end, gorgeous shirt minus the nicks and imperfections throughout it. And btw, the leaves look a little mustard yellow, but they're really like a murky mustard green"
3.0,I wish they didn't have such a hard of a bottom and it would be more comfortable on the feet feels like you're wearing rocks on your feet
3.0,I should have read a little more because I didn't realize the material of the brown dress would be almost like a speedo swimsuit and the dress is incredibly incredibly long. Oh well!
3.0,Nice shape
3.0,The dress was longer than I expected! It went down to my ankles!. The neckline isn’t too revealing. The arms were a little tight.
3.0,The shirt fits a little in the smaller sides and the pants are too big.  Heavy material.  Material is good wood quality.
3.0,"This dress was not what I expected or imagined.  Not enough was specified about the dress.  It has gathers in the waist, which was not mentioned.  I did not like the material, it was lighter than expected.  Too much material in the dress due to the gathers."
3.0,Product was good until first wash and dry then shrunk two sizes smaller! Great value but order big !
3.0,Not what I was wanting
3.0,I love these they aren't too hot or too cool but they are very thin. You definitely want to wear something long enough to cover!  They are super comfy to!
3.0,"I bought these to put in my second hole on my lobe. They were cute and in reality they are not that large but for my second piercing they were too large for me. Otherwise, very cute and sparkly."
3.0,Nice quality runs large
3.0,OK turtleneck. It fits a bit on the small side and I don't feel comfortable wearing it out of the house. I'd size up if I were you. It will work for a pajama shirt so I'm not going to return it.
3.0,"I got an XL..... it runs extremely small. I hav3 a 38B boob size, and it was to small. I got it to fit, but a bit uncomfortable. Yet the boustier is very pretty"
3.0,Returned to small no very warm
3.0,"This was a cute phone case, only problem is it does get dirty really fast. I have yet to find a case that lasts prestine during normal day to day use."
3.0,Did not come boxed
3.0,I have several pair and this one has a tiny little piece of electric at waist while others are wider.... disappointed.
3.0,I've had to update my review as the first time I tried on this sports bra I loved it. But when I looked in the mirror my nips showed right through and I was planning to wear this under a rash guard at the waterpark. Also I found this to be a little bit low cut I kept having to pull it up to make sure nothing was showing. I will continue my hunt
3.0,"This is a good value for the money....however, not All of the acrylic plates snapped into place when inserted the picture.<br />Please note, that you can not put two images back to back for front/back view .  The acrylic cover will not snap into place.  We ended up printing on double sided paper, which helped a lot , but we still had 1 out of 10 that did not snap into place.  The actual ring itself isn't very strong.... but if you are giving as an event item,  it works out well."
3.0,TOO SMALL- I love this shirt. I ordered 3XL I got in on but skin tight! Always order 3 sizes bigger.
3.0,"Not very soft, maybe better after a few washes."
3.0,They look and fit well. But they do fog up with a mask on.
3.0,"watch the wind,  it blows the dress straight up.  Could use some heavy pots of gold at that bottom to hold it down lol This is a great dress, I just wore to work for st pattys day.  I'm 5'2 and 140lbs. Large fits pretty good."
3.0,When this sweatshirt comes out of the drier there’s a hair brush worth of hair and lint stuck to it. It’s so gross. And it won’t all come off.  This was my first Northface purchase and I am really disappointed in the quality for the price.<br /><br />I am 5’ 168 and I purchased a large. It’s only slightly baggy. I could’ve sized down for a more fitted look.
3.0,My size in number but they were too tight and uncomfortable for me I thought they were going to fit because of the size number. I guess you have to get a 1/2 size bigger but Im not sure if they come in 1/2 sizes. I dont feel fooled that they did not fit me but the sizes should be the sizes. maybe get one size bigger. But if they were my size they would have fitted very comfortable.<br /><br />The material on these slippers is very warm and cool dont know how that happen but it did. The way they are made are great. Great<br /><br />sewing on these. But one catch you have to wash them by hand which they dont explain it in the discription of the product.<br /><br />Be blessed
3.0,"These slippers are just OK; nothing special.<br /><br />-The top design is put on backwards from the normal so that I mixing up R from L<br /><br />-There seems to be no cushioning between the sole and the lining.<br /><br />The color is nice though. The lining is not holding up particularly well, I must say."
3.0,Did not fit my Pandora bracelet as stated.
3.0,"The dress did not arrive in the color that my daughter had originally picked out and I purchased. It arrived in baby blue rather than the aqua that was purchsed, however my daughter is not to picky and was very excited that her dress had shown up. She look like a princess and felt like one to and as her mom that's all that mattered. The size fit she is a size 7/8 and a 8 fit her perfect."
3.0,The material is very clingy
3.0,"The fishnet pantyhose looked nice despite the rip.  It's unfortunate it was a one-time use pantyhose.  The positive side is, no one noticed but me.  I'm surprised since it is a plus size pantyhose.  It lasted all of 30 minutes until it ripped.  By that time I was on the way to the Halloween party and I wasn't going to turn back around."
3.0,"As cute as it looks, one ear ring broke as it slipped off my hand. It is not made well."
3.0,Looks nice.  Just wished the cotton was softer
3.0,It was very cheap made
3.0,They give excellent support but are still not easy to put on or take off.
3.0,Very cute top. Just runs small. I suggest ordering up two sizes.
3.0,"These are very comfortable and have a cooling feel to them when you put them on.  I am 6'2"", 175lbs and the medium size fit me perfectly.<br /><br />I would have rated them 5 stars, but the '3 pack' only contained 1 pair."
3.0,"This skirt is beautiful. The problem is that it is very small. It almost seems like it is meant for a child.<br /><br />The waist line does stretch quite a bit, but the length is much shorter than it looks in their pictures."
3.0,"It nice but if you are in a field that requires a<br /> constant movement, the thickness of the mask plus a filter will make it a little difficult to breathe. But its not that bad"
3.0,Good goggles  more for teenage kids not adults.
3.0,"Beautiful ring..if it had all the stones in it. My ring is missing 1 stone, and it looks ridiculous."
3.0,Pros: nice color<br /><br />Cons: very Thin material<br />Slit comes up very high and leaves a wide gap on curvier women<br />Can’t even wear it with pasties- not for bigger boobs
3.0,We bought this for our daughters ballet class. It is very pretty but although the fabric is nice it's a little see through.  We decided to keep it but she might have to wear something under.
3.0,They are not as long as they look in the picture.  They fit my little Girl but not me.
3.0,Average.....
3.0,"This necklace is ok, but it is a much lighter, but not as beautiful, I only give it three stars because I have to tie it around my neck and it hard to take it off."
3.0,It durable just..
3.0,"It's a decent bowling shirt for the price, but too big.I'm a 44 chest 200 lbs and this lg size could fit a 250 pounder,so I'm sending it back for a medium."
3.0,"On the small side, not able to store as many deposit slips, receipts, ATM card. Nice looking, great color."
3.0,Shirt was really short in length.
3.0,"Was hoping these would work, unfortunately they were WAY to small and there is not much give to the material. I ended up giving these to my sister that only weighs 100 pounds and they fit her perfectly."
3.0,"Runs very short, have to size up. My son is 11 ( just turned) and will need at least a 14/16"
3.0,"Pretty but it is one long strap piece, so it doesn't lie flat.  You wrap it around but where you fasten it - it will have to overlap at the buckle, so it won't look like the picture."
3.0,Wife said material was short.
3.0,"I was looking for a replacement for a shoe recently discontinued and gambled this one would do the trick.  The skip on was tight at first, but with breaking it in with regular arch support inserts, it soon worked well with the high arch support inserts I needed.  They work for me and I will order again.  - I did order again and the second pair was not so good.  You need to work on your consistent quality.  Will not order again."
3.0,Cute pants but they sent the wrong color
3.0,"Cute dress, but waaaaaay too long. Sent it back."
3.0,Not as large as I'd like.
3.0,"Pretty, but definitely not one size fits all. Too small for larger sizes."
3.0,"The biggest size barely fits on a 34A.  But if you can put it on, it looks great.  Asian size?  Most Asian people are not that small!  I don't get why these are so tiny."
3.0,"My wife, a full-figured older woman, tried it on, and it simply was a little tight, even at XL.  Mainly though, it simply didn't look good on her, so we returned it."
3.0,Very flimsy but it's cute
3.0,Extremely big. The material is soft and nice though.
3.0,Light weight which is good but too short in the rise which is bad. Not for me.
3.0,"So I rarely order clothes online but when I do I rely on reviews so fair warning this thing is kinda a trap.<br />I only just started waring bodysuits so when I found this one with only a 5 star review I took a chance. This thing arrived on time and was well packaged. But as soon as i opened it, red flags.<br />The tag for what brand this top was and what size had been cut off. There were no sale tags on this. The material is a bathing suit material but the sleeves are lace and are cute. The neckline has this wonky ripple in the scrunching part like the elastic is old and lost its shape. I held it aganist me (I ordered a 3xl and I'm bra size 36d 5'8"" 250lbs) and it was too short. Sure itll stretch because of the material, but it would mess with the sweetheart part in the front if it stretches too much. Dissappointed in that because I loved the look on the model.<br /><br />Some good points- and how it got 3 stars rather then none lol<br />It arrived with no holes  or damage (minus the stage being cut out that days size and brand) and with snaps in the crouch. It is true black my camera just made it look grey in the pictures, and if your petite with a shorter torso this could work for you. I needed something a little longer and in a different material so I'll be returning it if possible with the seller. I'll update on how that goes"
3.0,"Nice pants but was not the usual fit. Too big, baggy below the butt. Had to return them."
3.0,"The quality is alright, but the shape is a lot boxier than expected. I just turned it into a sleep shirt, rather than something I would wear out of the house"
3.0,"This hat is warm with the fleece lining. I was happy that it arrived in time before our snowstorm this weekend. However; it seems a little small for an adult hat. It was tight on me & started to give me a headache. I tried it on my 5-year old, & it for him perfectly! I guess my child has a new hat this winter."
3.0,It's very pretty but the clasp unlocks very easily and slips off my wrist all the time
3.0,"Since I did not buy it for myself, I cannot vouch for fit or comfort.<br /><br />I bought this for a lady friend, hoping to at least have it modeled for me...and was let down.<br /><br />Fit, comfort, and quality: ? Stars<br /><br />Enjoyment: 0 stars, but not the fault of the manufacturer."
3.0,"Fixed a little on the large size for my head, but I love it and would buy again."
3.0,"I love the product itself, but the inside magnet is now lost."
3.0,"I bought these with the matching shinguards and handwraps, so I'm bummed that I'm returning the gloves since my shinguards won't match, but the gloves I got just won't work for me.<br />They look great on the outside, they punch well, and they're nice and snug, but... The inner lining is so loose that my fingers don't go all the way inside of the glove. You know that feeling when you wear socks that are too loose and they bunch up around your toes, making it really uncomfortable to walk? Imagine that between your fingers.<br />It's possible that I just got a dud pair, and I COULD deal with it, but for the amount of training I do per day, I don't want to be frustrated every time I put them on.<br />I included a few pictures so you can see the inner lining bunching up in the middle of the glove. That fabric should be sewn into the tip of the glove, it shouldn't be loose enough that it tries to come out with my fingers when I take the glove off."
3.0,Decent material but I ordered the set with one standard camo and one digital camo and this is what I got.
3.0,Pretty and I love the look and how many keychains I can fit on it but the hook comes undone often on my pant loop or what ever I attach it to and that’s a HUGE issue for me risking losing my keys while I’m out and about is not a good worry
3.0,The lock isn’t secure all the time. So that’s the only thing I see wrong with this watch.<br /><br />If the watch has a better way of locking in place. It’s great
3.0,"The sweater is good, kind of a felt material with elastic at the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the sweater.  However, we didn't receive the wig at all. It wasn't in the package. We weren't really planning on using it, anyway, but we didn't exactly get everything we paid for.  Since I was just after the sweater, it'll do."
3.0,Seemed a little juvenile when it arrived and I saw it in person. May be good for a teen.
3.0,"Not gift packed at all..., in small zip lock bags for each piece..., taped together in a blob..., which is disappointing and inconvenient.  Seems like a good value not sure why no box"
3.0,"Love this dress! However, I am large chested (DDD-F) MY breast fall out no matter what type of bra, fashion tape, ect... I used. I sadly ended up returning it because I couldn't get my breast to stay in it."
3.0,Not really slouchy or baggy which is why I gave it a 3
3.0,"This will do. I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a large. I am definitely a medium, bordering on small. Large is slightly too small but it will work. Extra large would have been better. The adjustable straps are the only reason I'm able to make the large work. I had to let them all the way out."
3.0,The fit was too tight and the color wasn’t what I was expecting. I thought the cotton was a little thin and was wanting something more durable feeling for hard wear at work.
3.0,"I got this in yellow and dark blue. The dark blue is good, but the yellow stains so easily. I dropped regular water on it and it has a stain...lighter colors are also see-through, while the dark blue is fine.<br />This is a very light dress, not for formal wear at all."
3.0,"Very small. If you can find a wrist it fits, its pretty."
3.0,They change color
3.0,not very good fabric. runs little large
3.0,Not the best craftmanship but they will last for at least a season.
3.0,"Bought this in white, fabric is very thin and translucent."
3.0,Little shorter than I expected and they don't seem to wick as advertised
3.0,"These pants are great for hiking. They have a fabric that dries quickly and repels dirt too. They are convertible so you can zip them off and have shorts. There are plenty of pockets on these.<br /><br />The sizing on these is really confusing. Usually a size 30 means size 30 waist but apparently a size 30 is for a 32 inch waist and we should have sized down to a 29. These are too big for my husband. Also, if you have small legs, these are big in the legs. My husband also doesn't like how they fit around the ankle and wishes they were a little more fitted around the ankle. Overall, if you can get the sizing right on these and have bigger legs, these would be a great pair of outdoor pants."
3.0,I was expecting them to be more of compression fit but it’s not.
3.0,"Watch is over designed.  The display is too busy, too much detail makes it hard to read.  Silver characters against black is unreadable in the sun.  The strap pins are not spring loaded, and constantly back out."
3.0,Necklace too large
3.0,Height was too tall for my leg and flared out.
3.0,Thought this was way too long
3.0,Don't like the material but the dress is okay
3.0,"I purchased the largest they had and they were still a bit tight. I wouldn't call my arms extra ordinarily large, ripped maybe, yeah I'm going to go with ripped. My ripped biceps were squeezed a bit in these, the pads were good though. ;)"
3.0,Great charm but wish it was hanging instead of mounted it makes it hard to see the design.
3.0,"Update: After having it a few weeks I found it runs fast. I don't recommend this watch.<br /><br />Bought it just to see how it was. Its really not a bad watch, just cheap. It looks pretty good and the dial is actually very nice. The case is light, I almost think it is chrome plated. The band was folded metal and on the flimsy side. I placed it on a NATO strap. I cant give it 5 stars because there are other watches that have been a great buys at diffrent price points. Even as cheap as this was, I do not believe it is a good buy."
3.0,"Super cute, but the metal part that goes into your ear is pretty thick which makes my ears uncomfortable. Might switch out the charms onto different hoops"
3.0,Really cute but it has no stretch and fits kinda off.
3.0,"Fits kind of large at the top, I like the sweatband but the cap makes me hot. Really love the print."
3.0,I love the relaxing look and feel of this dress. It is very BIG
3.0,"Simple body chain, nothing special. Cute for some outfits."
3.0,These compression socks are kind of odd. I think my mistake was in buying one with a pattern because that pattern imprints into my legs everytime I wear them. A solid color may serve a better purpose or a bigger size. I don't know.
3.0,Received today I do like the hat but there are so many creases in it that I need a dummy head to put the hat on to remove the creases I hope that in time they will just go away but I cannot wear it the way is it now maybe you should package different just saying
3.0,Beautiful color but not to flattering. The way it was cut landed across the bust. Made you look pregnant.
3.0,"I realize I didn't pay all that much for this item, but it is super cheap material. It's really really thin. Although it fits, it's going to be really hard to wear. All in all I wish I hadn't given it a try."
3.0,"The quality of the material and stitching felt better than I expected. They materials all felt strong and like they were likely to hold up to frequent use and washing.<br /><br />The material felt a little scratchy compared to other pants. I'm not sure this would have been noticed in usual work-out conditions but in my hands the material felt rough.<br /><br />I did end up returning the item that I ordered because the tights were too small. I wear a L or XL in most things, and purchased this item in an XL. They weren't long enough for my legs and were too tight for comfort. Similar ""compression tights"" from other companies fit me correctly at an XL."
3.0,"Bought these for my daughter who can guarantee same day loss of any earrings she wears. I couldn't detect any difference between these and the regular earring backs she wears, and yes, she lost an earring the day she wore these. Back to the drawing board."
3.0,"Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, but its too short so she doesn't wear it."
3.0,Nice fit. Quite short. But the white is just completely see through. I haven't even been able to wear it.
3.0,Nice variety of colors and they are the type yoga socks I was looking for. However they say shoe size 5 1/2 to 10; I wear size 7 or<br />7 1/2 and these are quite snug.  I cannot imagine an 8 or larger even being able to get into them. Hoping they will stretch out just a little bit to be more comfortable for my size feet.
3.0,"When this bag arrived it was a little smaller than I wanted but it was a nice bag so I kept it but before I even got a chance to use the bag,  it started smelling like fish. You seriously can't open this bag in front of anyone because of the odor."
3.0,The outfit was not true to size but it’s cute and quality was good
3.0,Pretty but ineffective unable to pull a zipper without coming apart
3.0,It is a leather bag with a zipper down the middle and a lining on the inside.  If that is all you need then it will work fine to hold your soaps and such
3.0,"It worked out for what I got it for, but wouldn't purchase again."
3.0,"Not as cute in person, very snug."
3.0,"I like the variation and look of the necklaces in this set. However, the chain links break apart too easily."
3.0,"Not good for keeping germs out, to thin."
3.0,Cute and comfy. Took a long time to get here but I love it.
3.0,"This dress was perfect for my bachelorette night out. Just the right amount of sexy and conservative. I'm 5'5&#34; 110 normally a small. I bouht and XS and had to take it in on the sides and bust. Very stretchy fabric and made well, just runs large."
3.0,I like this top but it definitely runs small.  I ordered a size large and its a big snug on me (I'm a 36B for reference).  It is basically a cami with a built in shelf bra that has removable padding.  I found the padding to be flimsy and didn't retain its shape very well so I replaced it with some I already had and I like it better that way. It is otherwise comfortable and I like it.
3.0,Super cheap but cute
3.0,"Don’t get me wrong I am in looooove with these earrings AFTER I fixed them. When they arrived they were in a flat shipping envelope, I opened them to find that the backs were completely bend down. Super cute but that was disappointing"
3.0,"The sizing for this sweater is reallly confusing. Here's what happened to me. When you choose a size from the drop-down menu, the description of the item changes to then say one size SMALLER than what you picked. I typically wear a small, so when I chose &#34;Medium&#34; from the drop-down menu, the item description said &#34;Short Knit Length Cardigan Sweater (US-S).&#34; So what size did I actually receive? I got a medium, and it was too big. So, lesson learned, you will receive whatever size you pick off of the drop-down menu. Sending it back!<br /><br />I don't think I will reorder a small in this item because it also has kind of loose, casual fit. I was looking for something with more of a tailored fit that could be dressed up. The fabric is actually quite soft and feels nice. Lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy. But it has more of a loungy look than a dressy look. Nothing wrong with that, it just didn't fit the purpose of what I needed it for."
3.0,"I am 5'7"" so I am not a short person but these pants were much too long. I am not accustomed to wearing 4 inch heals with pajamas or lounge pants. I had to hem them before I could wear them."
3.0,No se mantienen en su lugar y sin muy pesadas y grandes
3.0,Great pjs however my gripe is with the price.  I spent $25 on them and the tag said $12.88. Not happy about that.
3.0,Cute and soft. Ok quality.
3.0,"I ordered the size the chart suggested for my measurements, it fit big."
3.0,Not sure I like it.  It's too large in parts and just right in others. And it looks a lot like a scrub top 😏
3.0,"I like the look of the dress. Unfortunately it's so huge I didn't look even remotely like the model. I'm 5'4"" and around 130lbs. It was three times the width of my body. I wanted to be oversized but it felt like I had drapped a sleeping bag over myself. It just looked strange."
3.0,"I love these, the get laughs at work! WAY TO expensive for one pair though. they are very thin though and wears holes easily."
3.0,I like it but it always twist
3.0,This is a very nice necklace only down side was that a piece of it was broken when I got it
3.0,"Thinner and lower quality than the citizen loops they replaced, also just a bit too large despite being ordered for the correct size."
3.0,They were too small other than that I liked them for a gift.
3.0,This handle makes pulling your SporTube a lot easier. It is well-made and easy to clip on or remove for flight. I rated it three stars instead of five perhaps unfairly - the product is great - what I am reacting to is that this should clearly be included in the original SporTube purchase. The only reason I can think of not to do that is to add a hidden cost to the SporTube purchase. 100% of SporTube owners would want to have this handle if it wasn't an extra thing to buy.
3.0,"My boyfriend has a large noggin and this hat was big on him.  I think it made him feel good about his big head, though.  The front is pretty pointy, and it didn't look right on him so we are returning it."
3.0,it did not last long<br /><br />the stick was not long enough for my growing belly
3.0,"Love the shirt, just wish they sent me the right size!!!!"
3.0,Really thin chains that tangle easily.
3.0,Runs small. Unable to wear unless I lose wt.
3.0,These insoles worked well but they didn’t offer a lot of cushion. Very supportive but they should ad more cushion to the insole.
3.0,Runs big. Try to downsize at least one size
3.0,"Comfortable, however water entry is accessible. Same with other reviewers. Overall not much to recommend, as long as water entry is a problem."
3.0,"Very comfortable, but the small, while it ""fits"", is a little too big.  It could just be the cut, but they just seem a little too big and are very stretchy, so it feels like they get looser throughout the day.  For reference, I am 5'4"" and 126 pounds and got a small.  It is fine for some cheap comfortable underwear, but it won't feel flattering.  At 49 I am looking mostly for comfort anyway, they just feel a little loose."
3.0,My husband wanted a different style
3.0,"It provided great compression. True to size. However, after washing it in the washer, threads started coming out from its seam."
3.0,"The item is attractive and seems to be well made, but the strap is thick and hard to ""pin"". Maybe it will improve with time and use, but initial attempts to get it on is like trying to thread a catchers mitt. It's not supple at all."
3.0,"The badge look good but the box/case for them is just a cardboard box, would be better if it was a hard cover of sorts"
3.0,These things are very flimsy - work well otherwise
3.0,"The product itself is very cute. Fits how it should I think, lol, since I don't typically wear halter tops. I'm still getting used to how the sides ruffle out on the bust part and that you can wear it bra less. Aside from getting used  to that it's great."
3.0,Material is fine but these fit like baggy jeans.  Size is way big. Ordered a small and could have used an xxsmall.
3.0,"I really like the actual hammer, a little bit longer handle might be nice.  Chain, however, is much too short.  It should be a foot to 18 inches longer.  It might fit a female neck much better but it would still probably be more of a choker than a pendant."
3.0,"ordered a large, they sent an XL...normally a medium...it looked smallish and it was.....washed it, shrunk  some, arms a bit short (I am tall)<br />kept it because it was cheap and mostly made of cotton...thinner than most sweatshirts and cotton quality the hard kind...kept cause I needed a black hoodie...but beware of the sizing..."
3.0,"I bought this dress hoping it would be more of a date-esque dress, however, it is a cute work appropriate dress. I have a hard time getting the dress on as I have broader shoulders. I am 5' 1"" and 110lbs. I ordered a small and cannot put my arms very far forward without fear of ripping the seams. Because of this, I also need help removing the dress as it constricts my arms' ability to lift it over my head to pull it off.  It is a cute well made twenty dollar dress. Due to my own proportions and the dress proportions, I likely won't wear it as much as I had hoped.<br /><br />UPDATE-- it broke at the shoulder seams when I was driving and reached toward the steering wheel. Just too small."
3.0,I wished these worked out for us. My daughter is the sock Houdini. She still manages to take these suckers off at 8 months. What has worked for us is socks on. My daughter hasn’t taken her socks off with those...and they are cheaper.
3.0,"I am not sure if this actually works or not and it’s been 2 months. I would maybe try a different method. If not, go a size smaller."
3.0,like the watch but band is too short and i have small wrists.
3.0,"This does the trick, I guess. It fits the device and all, but is clearly a generic and not as comfortable as the original wrist band."
3.0,I ordered a size up the sleves run short and shrink when dried other wise they would be half up the forearm if I hadnt ordered a size up.  I do like the colors and flow of the mid section of sweater
3.0,Love these but the seam at the tush unraveled after one wash. No way to raise a complaint.
3.0,"The skirt was a bit long for me being 5’3 the ties on the side only helped a bit, I haven’t worn it out because I’m afraid I will step on it and it is also very thin almost see through and might rip easily. I ordered the Red one but the color is more burnt orange like."
3.0,Cute but make my ears hurt because they are thicker than a normal gage.
3.0,"I’m 5’2 & 175lbs short & thicker in the bottom part of my body, ordered a medium based on the reviews. They aren’t as form fitting as I was expecting & extremely long. Returning for a size small will update the review once they arrive. But overall the quality of these is amazing super cute & light weight so perfect for spring & summer. The length was the only thing that killed it for me."
3.0,"Okay jacket. Not the highest quality. There are no buttons, only a clip that frequently comes undone. Cute jacket for the price."
3.0,This was a gift but the small size was tiny and the others were too big for what I was wanting. Otherwise they look fine.  I cannot wear them to give better review.
3.0,The XL is equal to a women’s small or smaller medium.
3.0,"I normally wear a medium. Not in this shirt. I had to send it back because it just was a little too small. However, I think the large would have been frumpy."
3.0,"It was a bit on the small side.  Seller was awesome about issuing a refund, though!"
3.0,Loved this outfit but the zipper broke the same day. The material was very thin. Was so sad because it was gorgeous.
3.0,"This watch has already stopped on me and I just recently received it. I don't think I will return it because it was cheap to begin with; however, it is a very pretty watch. I may change my mind. I noticed under bright lights that the watch really shines. It is also well balanced on my wrist and even though it was a little large for my wrist it did not turn or twist."
3.0,"I've gotten a couple of shirts similar to this on Amazon, but this one the sleeves are a little shorter.  Returned."
3.0,I loved the colors and the burgundy last for a while but the others broke after a day. So disappointing! Was really looking forward to rocking the tangerine. So the sum up only 1 was worth anything.
3.0,Didn't like it I returned it
3.0,Not bad for the prince. Not comfortable to wear all the time. Only one of the wings on each screws off and sometimes they don't line up perfectly.
3.0,Seems quality but material is different..heavy like but soft. Not necessarily bad but I wouldn't buy again with this kind of material feel.
3.0,It doesn’t grab on that good
3.0,"These glasses only became anti-fog when I rubbed Dawn dish soap into them.  They broke completely after 4 months of wear.  I do not know how long these should last, but this felt short."
3.0,"Great product, but I had to order it 3 x before I got one that worked properly."
3.0,"The product it's self is OK.  The material is a lower stitch count than I expected for satin material.  There is not much room it the front and not enough give to provide room for larger men's parts, however the waist fits fine."
3.0,The shoes look not durable...
3.0,"Larger than I thought it would be, although, I didn't pay much attention to the measurements  The handle cannot be tucked inside the bag to carry it like a clutch.  The beading is very nice but with this handle the style looks a bit old.."
3.0,"It is OK for the price and I expected for it to take time to arrive however, the pendant was attached backwards!  Easy fix; then it looks nice."
3.0,quite long had to have altered
3.0,"I dislike the way that the blue earring looks in my ear, but I do like the &#34;diamond&#34; one. However, the earring is loose in my ear and often gets stuck in my hair. Many people have commented that it looks like I have several piercings, which is what this earring is supposed to look like, more or less."
3.0,"First off, it is Miami University (THE).  The mug is very attractive and keeps coffee hot as promised.  Do not, however, immerse in water when cleaning as the seals are not tight, and water will enter the insulation space.  Shape is good for stability, but won't fit in most car holders."
3.0,"We got these for our daughter and she only likes them okay.  The quality is good, with a nice lightweight denim that's stretchy and comfortable.  The waistband too has a good amount of stretch, and the belt is cute and plenty long enough for a bow.  The front flap of the skort, however, doesn't come around very far and falls awkwardly right in the front middle.  It would like better if the flap came farther around.  Some might like it but my daughter isn't crazy about it.  Nice enough skort but a little funky."
3.0,"Way too small so much so it is uncomfortable. ""Extra Large"" men must not weigh much over 100 lbs in your world!!!"
3.0,Cute piece but size did not fit her
3.0,"Fits ok, i have a small head so a big hat looks tall when adjusted to fit.  Nice camo, looks good, will put my battalion patch on it and wear the sh*t out of it."
3.0,Good material but it had broken with in 2 weeks.
3.0,These are gifts for a couple homeless people. I imagine they are happy with the caps.
3.0,Doesnt quite sit on your hand like the picture. Hard to figure it out.
3.0,So tiny you can hardly tell it is a koala bear. Otherwise it is a nice little necklace; just wish it was bigger.
3.0,"This is better than 3 stars but it is see through. I love the comfort of it, the fit, the way it hangs and it has pockets. The only thing is the material is see through so you need to wear something under it or not care that people can see you through it. I got a light blue sleeveless and long sleeve black and adore them both. The black I sometimes wear something underneath but the light blue I always have a super long tank top or slip on underneath"
3.0,i was dissapointed that it was not a full  metal peace and two the horns are made of foume they arrived all squished and deformed
3.0,"I got it mainly because 2022 is Chinese Tiger Year, and I’d like to wear something with a tiger image . Not bad, not good."
3.0,"I use both,the little one cover more the big one is not worth it."
3.0,Very awesome and sleek set of earrings! Once you put them in and adjust them right you'll barely feel them in you ear.<br /><br />Update 9/23/2017: had to take away some stars due to the fact that one of the earrings broke in half only after a few uses. Very disappointed.
3.0,I returned this purchase because the coat looked yellow.
3.0,"Like the TSA locks and large amount t of space,  but the two larger bags cracked on our first trip with two flights.  On our second trip with two more flights,  a wheel on the 28&#34; suitcase became unusable because the suitcase cracked in two places.<br />Bcauae of this I just had to buy new luggage for my next trip."
3.0,It fit as expected and supports well. The lack of a lining means the thick seams on inside are not only visible on outside but kind of chaff a little. Also the straps dig into should more than any sports bra I purchased made by this brand. But it was cheap and does the job.
3.0,I like it but the way it is sewn you can not see the wording . Which is the only reason I wanted this mask. I don’t think it is worth the $12 I paid for it . I cut the sewing so that the words are easier to read like in my pic.
3.0,"It's comfortable and being able to adjust and move the weights around to different pockets is nice, plus it comes with little Velcro bags to hold your weights (I filled each with roughly 2.5 lbs of steel shot). It's fairly easy to take on and off and having two larger Velcro straps on the bottom let's you get it ""just right"" so that it doesn't bounce a lot during workouts.<br /><br />I went out on a limb with the though that spending more would mean better quality, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case... I've had the vest for less than 10 months and three of the pockets have ripped and the front of the left shoulder has begun ripping. This in less than 10onths with pretty infrequent use during CrossFit (probably used it 15-20 times so far).<br /><br />I'll probably end up taking out the stitches and resewing with double stitching as the vest only uses single-stitches throughout... That or I'll give another vest a shot... Maybe both."
3.0,Shoes are cute but not very comfortable.  Price is right and shipping is great but price for shipping is too high.
3.0,I received these in time. I got 1 that didnt have the top to it so I only got 15.  I got all different colors so if thats what you like then you you would like this . Worth the price I paid tho
3.0,Too small and the quality was not exactly what I expected.  It did not have the body I had hoped it would.
3.0,"A little confused with these ""wool socks"". How come something can be called ""wool socks"" when the main fabric is only 3%?<br />I mean they are nice padded socks, thermal ... not so much. I have tried a few other thermal socks and these ones does not keep my feet as warm as other brands."
3.0,"I love the style of the dress and I fit pretty good for Amazon clothing. But the dress was very thin, almost see-through and it felt like wrapping paper. And the straps had very messy stitching some of the string was coming out. I wouldn't waste your money on something so expensive and feels like you're walking around in wrapping paper."
3.0,I keep getting asked to review a product I haven't worn yet. I like the color.
3.0,I have to say that these earrings are really nice. I had a problem wearing the small side on the front. The bigger pearls in the back showed on the front of my ear lobes! I had to send them back for that reason. Nice quality tho.
3.0,Very pretty and I get compliments on it but it has lost some of the silver and is turning.
3.0,Good bag with lots of space......
3.0,Unfortunately the sewing is poor.
3.0,"I was kind of disappointed by this item because I knew that the pendant was pretty big, but in the picture the rose is a cream collar and in reality it's more of a gross yellow, so between the size and the color it looks like a child's dress-up piece, which isn't bad if that's what you're looking for. I didn't mind the size because I was going to make some steampunk piece for the stage, so the size would have been fine, but between that and the color it doesn't quite suit my purposes."
3.0,Only dislike is...well...it’s a different design than advertised. The “Troop Loops” has been replaced with “Whoopsies” for some reason. And the cereal changed from loops to...whatever that is. Very strange. Technically the same shirt but a different cereal name. Very confused.
3.0,"It’s a bit small, but will look so cute if I ever get to travel again! So I’m keeping it!"
3.0,I actually love this .. it says stainless steel but it keeps giving me a bad reaction
3.0,quality is not the best
3.0,Shrank significantly after drying.
3.0,"It looks like more of a mustard color, but the length, size & style is as you see it in the photo. I’m 5’1 so it goes about 4 inches below the knees but if bring it up and wear heels it looks better. Hope this helps."
3.0,"Runs small.Bought a large and it fits like a medium.In my case,that was fine because my kid normally wears a small but likes hoodies a medium so theres room.The material is thinner than most hoodies.It does say handwash only so concerned about washing it any other way."
3.0,"It’s not the soft stretchy lace you’d like but it is durable and strong, I am 5’11” and the length was perfect. However the bust area is too small, for someone who has a smaller chest, it’s great. I’m only a C cup and t was mushing my chest, even without a bra. I ordered an xxxl (5,11” 240lbs)"
3.0,"These boots are very cute looking and stylish.<br />However, they are made out of vinyl<br />which is good for a waterproof feature, but probably won’t last very long.  There wasn’t any arch support and your foot is flat inside. The toe area was wide and provided lots of wiggle room, and room for heavy socks. The heel in the back of the boot is thin cardboard under a thin cotton lining. These didn’t provide any support for my foot, and fit like slippers, but were not what I expected for a winter boot. Gave them to my granddaughter who loved the look, but we both knew these boots would not last very long."
3.0,AUN NO ME LLEGA A MI PAÍS DE ORIGEN. COMO PARA DAR MI OPINIÓN Y PARA PEDIR DEVOLUCIÓN.
3.0,Again thought they could be a bit larger.
3.0,Too big to stay up on average size mom!
3.0,"I think the scarf is very pretty, but In the picture it seemed like it was suppose to be bigger and wider than what I though. It will work, but I was a bit disappointed. Not what I pictured I would receive. Other than that it is nice."
3.0,I really loved this dress... until I washed it a couple times!!! There wasn’t any label inside with washing instructions... I guess I should have hand washed...
3.0,It’s so cute still. It does run extra small and the color is off.
3.0,"What I received doesn't actually look very much like the photos. The photos don't show that the outer material is actually some kind of weird lace. The body of the blouse is lined in the chiffon that shows at the hem, so it's opaque. But the sleeves are just lace, with your skin totally showing through (which isn't depicted in the photos at all). I can't really speak to the size, because I can't find anywhere in my order a record of the size I ordered! I would say that the sleeves are so extremely long that I won't be able to wear the outfit without alteration. If the sleeves had been opaque as pictured, I could have folded them up. Overall, I'll give this a &#34;meh,&#34; and put it away until warm weather returns."
3.0,Loved this bracelet until the &#34;sterling silver&#34; started peeling off and leaving s black mark on my wrist. Working on a fix for it.
3.0,Cute but it's big. Doesn't fit your average nb I'm assuming maybe 3 months n up
3.0,The material is funny. But it is still a cute sweat shirt.
3.0,"Nice, just too big."
3.0,Not the quality of the old sun clouds but they work
3.0,"The clip on feature was not actually clip on. There is no hinge lever to easily clip them on your glasses. It takes two hands and great patience to apply them to the glasses. I did like the look of the glasses, a clear flip up feature and the lenses were really nice."
3.0,The product looks fine but the finish is very crude.
3.0,The details on the earrings are not as sharp as in the photo.  The coloring was dull but otherwise they were fine.
3.0,"If you want a hat that covers just your skull, these caps are for you. Doesn't come down over your ears, so think about it an then make your decision. Gd luck."
3.0,Well made and nice looking product
3.0,But runs small
3.0,Fit somewhat smaller than expected but still works. Beautiful springy color.
3.0,"For reference, I am 5’4”, 135 pounds, 34D. The medium top fit me perfectly, however the leggings were a disaster. They were way too long and tight and not flattering at all. The lines did not line up well with my butt, either. I wish I could return just the leggings because the top is super comfy and supportive!"
3.0,"The overall quality of the hat is good, but the picture and the hat that came look nothing alike. The hat is glittery and gold."
3.0,"Purchased and arrived very quickly. Very cute and looks exactly like the picture online. Unfortunately, after only having for a couple of weeks the glasses have already come off."
3.0,"They were a little small and I hate all the bright colors.  I would have been happy with black and dark gray (as it appears they are based on the picture) but they came a s a mixed batch of mostly bright royal blue with neon yellow trim etc...If you're a male stripper, likely a good purchase for ya.  For us every day guys, you might want to pass..."
3.0,"This is a cute apron if you're looking for something lightweight and water resistant for a messy project. And the large pockets are handy, too. However, the material feels thin and a little crinkly.  If you're looking for something more like the retro cotton aprons that are so popular lately, this is not it. You should also know, the straps in the back of the apron are not fully adjustable- only the one that ties around your waist is.  Overall, I was just looking for something to keep my clothes protected, and I was offered a discount to try it out.  This has a cute dog design printed on it, and it will do the trick, but just know what you're buying."
3.0,The lace is better than expected but the proportions were off. The waist of the dress hit way above my natural waist and I don't have a particularly long torso. It also wasn't high enough to then be more of an empire style.
3.0,Not a super big fan of the clips on these. It is very difficult to get a mask on and off. Hopefully they loosen up with time.  It is not possible for my 5 year old to get her mask on herself. The colors are nice. Quality of the lanyard itself is good. The clips are terrible.
3.0,I ordered a little larger just to be safe and that made for a perfect fit. Works great as a t shirt bra or just everyday work bras!
3.0,It is huge on me. I bought it larger because it states the sizes run small. I will send it to a tailor for proper fitting
3.0,There was absolutely nothing wrong with the product other than my bird looking at it like it was an alien. He wanted nothing to do with the green leather gloves
3.0,It runs a little small for a large size.
3.0,Not as thick as advertised
3.0,"These were cute and fun, but not well made, most of the feathers on the headbands came off, the others were okay. We used them anyway."
3.0,I did not get the phone finger holder attachment thing and the buttons are def cheap quality but the keychain itself is nice.  Really? Just buy the keychain and skip the accessories. Not going to return because it is a Christmas gift
3.0,"Got it in great time.  The picture is Beautiful was a little disappointed in the material, thickness and how it fit."
3.0,These pants are nice enough to wear to church or work. They came extremely wrinkled and it took a while to steam them out after washing. They then wrinkled when I wore them. They run a little small through the hips.
3.0,Good buy if you have smaller kids you'll get more use.
3.0,used size chart and product was like 4 times too small.  Was able to give to my niece at college for lounge pants
3.0,"I was taking the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a larger size than I normally wear. I was so looking forward to getting my cozy comfy shirt but was disappointed as soon as I put it on. I normally wear a small/medium so I ordered an extra large thinking I would have plenty of spare room. Nope, not the case. I think it runs really small and it is much shorter than I would have expected it to be. I threw on my leggings and the darn shirt doesn't go but midway of my bottom! (and I don't have a very big behind)"
3.0,"It's tall, I can't reach the tilt button (I'm 5'9&#34;) — would be nice to have a way to have it a bit lower. The up/down arrows on the crank are the wrong way round. There's no little velcro strap to keep it slim when folded."
3.0,The jumpsuit was very nicely made but was at least 2 sizes smaller than the medium clothes I have ordered in the past from Amazon.
3.0,"Fit is tight, so depending on how you want it to fit, maybe order size up if you want any wiggle room."
3.0,"Cheaply made.  6 year old loved them though.  I guess it was worth it, but don't count on them being around for more than a couple of weeks."
3.0,"I’m a size 6 in women’s shoes and I feel these socks are a bit short. They’re a bit slippery on hardwood and does not stay up very well either, although I have very small ankles. Would not recommend for men or anyone with larger feet than mine or they may become ankle socks. Haven’t washed yet, so can’t speak on quality. Overall, ok."
3.0,Muy lindo pero chico talla. Comprar talla mas grande por corre pequeño
3.0,The pins that hold the shoe together coming out
3.0,legs too high and elastic a bit too tight
3.0,slimmer and smaller than sized. Cute print. Will have to give to someone smaller
3.0,My son is a size 6 so that's what I ordered. It is a gorgeous sock-shoe. I love the grippy sole. But my son's feet barely fit in them as his heel goes over the edge of the sole. I got the impression the soles need to contain the feet a little more. These run somewhat small as even my small size 4 twin barely fits in his.
3.0,"style with fold just on belly did not look good on me. May on very slim women. I am 5,3 134  p. so I did return dress."
3.0,Sending back to get a bigger size. The look is good but the jean itself is a bit thin. They need to use a thicker material.
3.0,I was soooooo excited when I saw thisssss! I had wanted a longgggg teddy coat for a while  now. Guess I was too excited cuz I totally overlooked the NO POCKETS..NO HOOD..&&& NOOOOO WAYYYYY TO KEEP IT CLOSED. But nonetheless I was going to return it BUT kept it just to throw on when I take the dogs out or run to the market 😉
3.0,Nice pattern.. fit my daughter a Little snug but ok.
3.0,"Not a true rose gold look. Also, very heavy. Pro:the little locket charm is cute. Not super happy but need to add to a late gift, otherwise would return"
3.0,"Absolutely loved the color and fit of this shirt! I'm usually in between a small and a medium but got the small. I am not a fan of the fabric used at all. It feel like a cheap canvas tote bag that you use for arts and crafts. But after a wash it did smooth out a bit, so over all its FINE. I like having it but wouldn't buy again."
3.0,Remove the smell from the product!<br />It is used to the human nose!
3.0,"Nick's wife here:<br />I was gifted this wishlist item for Christmas.  When I unwrapped it, the earrings were undoubtedly cute, but we returned them because of their size.  Despite estimating their size based on the description, they were simply too large for regular wear.  Attractive, but impractical-borderline-costumey."
3.0,"Nice glasses , a little challenging to keep clean!"
3.0,Cute and small. A nice addition with a simple necklace and little black dress. The piece that holds the back of the earring was rigid on mine. But that was the only issue.
3.0,These are way too small. I usually wear a large and  i have pretty skinny thighs and these (size large) barely fit over my thighs. The waistband does stretch so that is a plus.
3.0,"I like the fit and color of this shirt. The material is soft and feels good. However, the shirt arrived without any tags and smelled like cigarette smoke and deodorizer. I’ve hand washed it once but can’t get the smell out. Going to try machine washing next. It’s a shame because I really like the shirt but won’t be wearing it unless I can get the smell out."
3.0,These are a lot smaller than I thought. As you can see in the picture one is big enough to hold part of my thumb. The other is slightly larger. I will just have to buy crystals that are smaller then what I have. They are made good and strong and pretty.
3.0,The frame cracked in the provided case. They were ok while they lasted.
3.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend. Unfortunately the material looks cheap, the dress model is not as it looks in the pics. Runs small"
3.0,XL=medium I have small hands and the XL fits me as a medium of any other glove would. only get the XL.
3.0,While I am pleased with the overall look and fit.. was disappointed with the amount of loose threads and with some thread discoloration.
3.0,"These are ok.  Pretty small, but okay quality.  There are better sets and there are way worse sets on Amazon."
3.0,Waisy fit.  Bust was huge
3.0,I needed a new wallet and got this one. Upon putting my drivers license in the slot it tore due to such a tight fit. Then putting my credit card it that slot tore too. The stitching seemed to just rip. Wasn't the happiest but it still holds them securely. Also the front IH emblem doesn't seem too securely attached but it hasn't come off yet and I've had it a month.
3.0,I love the look of the top however the fabic and lenght has ne giving this a lower star.  I have to wear a tank top under the shirt other wise hello tummy no one needs to see.<br />It fits well across the shoulder and the tie adds a extra to a plain top
3.0,The sizing was not accurate. The buckle was a little hard to clasp shut. Not complicated just needing a lot of hand strength.<br />Otherwise a very nice belt.
3.0,"I like to wear socks to bed, but any tightness and it causes foot cramps in the early morning hours. These socks were very comfortable, but a little large....kept coming off in bed. I'll just keep looking and trying others."
3.0,They were ok if I had not bought to give as a gift.  They arrived all in one plastic bag and the backs to them in a separate bag. One of the blue earring's post was bent and one of the purple stones is coming out. No way I was going to give them as a gift like that.  I had to go to Khols and buy some more. Disappointed in these.
3.0,very pretty ring but after 2 days it turned my finger green
3.0,This is really attractive but it turns your wrist black
3.0,It was cute but broke the first night I wore it.
3.0,"I like the sturdy construction and optics. The glasses are a little narrow for bifocals. The readers take up the bottom 40%, so they take some getting used to."
3.0,Too hard to get to fit
3.0,"A bit disappointed in the fit.  Snug at places and long.  I am a petite so it did look like a dress on me, but I am still wearing it. If the arms weren't tight, I would be wearing it often."
3.0,I purchased this as a game prize. It will be great for that but may not work so well for daily use unless you are used to carrying a larger wallet.
3.0,It's alright. The dress is a little loose on me. And I got the smallest size. I'm  5'4 .. 115 lbs. Slim. It probably would look good on me if I was a little bigger or if it was made smaller. I put pictures up. The first two pictures it's loose on me by the waist area. The top part fits good. There's elastic on the top part. The last two pictures is of me with a tied rubber band on the back of the dress to make it tighter. To show it is a pretty dress. But for tiny girls it might be loose .
3.0,My grandson loved them. He likes to play soccer in the yard and he wore a hole in the fabric on the side of his foot where he kicks the ball. Fabric is soft but if you are not ruff on them they would be fine.
3.0,"The design of the scarf and pattern is really nice. It had a medium sized thickness and great length. The only downside was the scarf fabric was a bit rough on the skin. Unfortunately, I returned the scarf since my dad didn’t enjoy the feel of the fabric."
3.0,Was looking forward to getting these shorts and they were to small. I even got a larger size. I am in the process of losing weight so I have kept them and just hope I can wear eventually!!
3.0,The fit was 2 sizes to small
3.0,Just ok quality
3.0,"Not bad, not good. &#34;Tail&#34; has to be dog fur or something"
3.0,The sleeves and shoulder were so tight<br />And small
3.0,"Very beautiful but had to have one of the jackets hole opened up, it came closed."
3.0,"Love the texture, but the mask itself is very large and I couldn’t keep it on my face. Hopefully they will fit my husband"
3.0,I like the color. I don't like that I ordered 2 sizes larger than I wear. Past experiences with orders has taught me to order larger. The knit is cheap. I would expect at least a jersey knit for the price. The dress doesn't look or fit like the one in photo.  I will keep it because the cost of sending it back isn't worth it.
3.0,Length runs small. Order a size bigger.
3.0,Fits ok but attracted lint
3.0,"Great beach wear, but shorter than expected. The length is about mid-calf."
3.0,Way too big. Size down
3.0,These are so cute but way too tight at the base of my calves. Really wish they would’ve worked. If you have larger or more muscular legs I would not recommend.
3.0,"I had purchased this watch a few months back and have been wearing it for  6 weeks now.  While it IS an attractive looking watch and keeps good time it keeps falling off my wrist because it gets unclasped so easily!  Also, the band's mesh has separated a bit  at the corner and because of this it catches onto the fabric of  my long sleeved coat/shirt.  I must say that I'm  somewhat disappointed in this purchase and came close to giving it just a 2 star rating.  Thanls."
3.0,"I usually wear XL so according to chart size I order XXL but it was to large send it back I got L. the arms was a little tight. but if I bought the XL under neath the boobs it will be to big. the L is not tight at all underneath, is just the arms. I am loosing weight so maybe it will get better LOL still wear it all day at work under my clothes."
3.0,"Sorry, tone did not retain."
3.0,"The ring is very nice, detail is great and it fits well. The stone often just has a streak of color instead of the entire stone changing color. Love the ring, just wished the stone was as nice."
3.0,"I liked these shirts overall—quality was good but the fit was very small.  I typically wear a size 6-8 or medium and ordered a large for a roomier fit and it was still very small.  I don’t think xLarge would be much better, as it ran so small in general."
3.0,"The dress fit alright but I didn’t like the color. In person, the dress (floral print) was a dull blue color. The floral print was dull as well. I returned it because it didn’t look like the advertised picture."
3.0,The Chin doesn't fully cover making the mask look kind of awkward. Covers the mouth well and comfortable though.
3.0,"too small, bought size 5 years old and fit my 3 year old son !"
3.0,Size is not correct
3.0,"I wanted a light weight rain top for some winter running - here in Seattle we get a lot of drizzle so this top sounded well suited,  I think it might be better for summer days though as the fit is pretty tight with narrow arms so wearing a sweatshirt underneath is pretty uncomfortable."
3.0,"It's a one-size-fits-all so the fit was exactly right.  The sleeves however are a bit strange.  (BTW, when you first look at it upon receipt, you'll groan because they look to be cap-sleeves.  Not to worry.)  The fabric is not particular attractive, IMO."
3.0,nice colors and very light weight.
3.0,"I typically wear a large so -- since this is made in China -- I ordered an XL.  The blouse was so small I could barely get it over my arms, let alone smoothed over my boobs."
3.0,It is a polyester material. Can shrink some when washing/drying. I wish it had been cotton.
3.0,Not enough cushion on bottom
3.0,"Not what I expected, thought it would look more lifelike shape, but not at all. In person, hard to tell what it is."
3.0,They were tight on the feet and did not notice any warming capability as advertised.
3.0,They do not open up like the sunglasses they carry. If you have a small face then these would work.
3.0,I actually really likes this dress and ordered the largest size they had and it was to tight in the bust area.  I normally wear a 2-3 x shirt. People are right when they say to order 2 x larger or better.  I would have loved to order it a size larger for my trip.
3.0,"I have another bluetooth beanie but I was getting sick of it and it was a bit too thick for warmer days. I bought this one to use for the warmer days, but it was so big on my head, and you cant roll it over because of the headphones, that it made me look like a conehead. Also, the material was much thicker than expected, and didnt really feel how it looks onscreen. So I had to return. But its a quality product if you're looking for a thick grey beanie, and have a somewhat larger head."
3.0,Wow I'm 5'5 and these are about 4 inches too long on me. Very comfortable but pretty see through.
3.0,Beautiful but HUGE. Sort of like the gangster- clock necklaces of the 80s. The ruby slippers are over 2” long. But they are absolutely lovely and so sparkly. As a necklace I’d assign a grade of 1 star but the artwork is a “5” so overall I’m giving it a “3”. For the price I can use the slippers in an art project of some sort to make it a worthwhile purchase and gift for a Wizard of Oz fan.
3.0,"This was really pretty, was.....only put it on my daughter one time and the clasp broke. I was able to replace the clasp but it's been hanging on the jewelry stand since."
3.0,"I bought a medium, which turned out to be really loose in the thighs, hips and waist.<br />I am 125 pounds at 4 ft 10 in., with 39 in. hips and a 27 in. waist. Medium is my go-to size for lower-body garments. It surprised me that these were so big.<br />The fabric was also somewhere between matte and shiny. I'm not a fan of the latter, or else I might have tried to make these work as lounge pants, but the size issues just made it seems not worth it. Ended up returning these."
3.0,"The mask is very pretty but the material it is made of renders it ineffective for virus protection. It does come with two filters, which is nice, but the material slips easily."
3.0,"Other than being a Macho Man product and kind of funny, this is not worth the money. It is small. Could not tie it around my head. It might work as a bandana around a neck.<br />Material is scratchy."
3.0,It is a beautiful color and fits well. My only complaint is that it came with wrinkles and they don't wash out.
3.0,When the package came I noticed it had a hole underneath the armpit
3.0,I sent this back because it was a little too small
3.0,"The jeans were cute; however, after washing and drying, they were extremely wrinkled and needed to be ironed, unlike most jeans!"
3.0,The size of the facial covering is not consistent with the size of the ear loops--covering large and loops small.  The mask leave an opening around the nose and under the chin.
3.0,Wish it wasn’t so easy to knock of my wrist
3.0,"The case for the key fob was perfect but when I had opened the little bag that contained the contents the pink Buick band was pretty dirty and had black stuff on it right after I pulled it fresh out of the package. Which I had attempted to clean some of it off , and some of it did but I’m still kinda disappointed about the product because this was for my girlfriend."
3.0,"This is cute, but the zipper is not so good, so I have to fix it."
3.0,"Nice size bag, but I was disappointed with the color.  I wanted the color red pictured, but this is burgundy,  not red."
3.0,This is a good cloth that does a wonderful job polishing silver and jewelry. I gave it three stars because I don't feel it is much better than any other jewelry cloth on the market.
3.0,Very cute but run small. I'd say the size is more like 0-3mo.
3.0,"We had high hopes for these as earring bases but alas our hopes were dashed upon arrival.  They are molded on one side only.  The picture shows the front but the back is hollow.  We will keep them as they weren't that expensive and might work for necklaces but if you want earring foundations, look elsewhere."
3.0,Material is beautiful but the Quality is just not that GREAT!
3.0,Slightly smaller then expected
3.0,Little small but love it..will definitely order from this company againi don't have any thing else to say omg really
3.0,"This is an open shoulder hoodie dress with a kangaroo pocket. It is oversized and wears that way, except for the length. It was a good few inches above my knees but the shoulders fit just like those on the model for me. The cut out starts after where the shoulder curves into the arm and has a nice seam around the edge of the cut out.<br /><br />The fabric is disappointing. It isn't super soft and suggly like I want with hoodie but instead a little scratchy. It probably with soften a bit over time - but that means I have to wear it as it is before getting to that point. The hood is nice sized and the kangaroo pocket is unlined.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't love this but could be perfect for someone else who loves the cut out shoulder look."
3.0,These are too big! Order a size down...
3.0,"Bracelet is very pretty, but leather has a very bad odor.  Fits true to size."
3.0,Ordered the green and the color is not a vibrant as shown but it fits. Im a size 16 and 2x fits great
3.0,"They were not very durable and the wave cap colors didn't match durags,"
3.0,Very small key chain
3.0,"it took a number of weeks to receive, but it's nice."
3.0,Thought it would be embroidered and not heat printed but all in all a nice shirt
3.0,"Charm is adorable. The chain was extra long, too long for child to wear it. ( charm hung below the waist of tall 5 year old."
3.0,"Ordered this necklace as a Christmas Present. It was cheaply made, it broke within a month. Very disappointed...will not buy this brand again."
3.0,"Very plain boot design, looks better in the picture. Overall, has a cheap look. Expect the heel to wear very quickly"
3.0,the top is much smaller than expected and it’s weirdly firm
3.0,"I like this company's (Joy Susan's) merchandise a lot: purses and bags of smooth, supple faux leather. They offer lots of nice styles and I was interested in a purses that are like small tote bags. The only problem is that none of them have interior pockets. The company tries to get around this by including a small, removable interior bag with each larger bag. But that just clutters up the interior, and I'd much rather have a cell phone pocket AND a secure zipper pocket on the *inside* of the bag.  I hope Joy Susan will consider a style with built-in pockets in the future."
3.0,"I didn’t need this, but thought I would.  Very expensive and the zipper ends are uncomfortable against my skin."
3.0,"I order size M and it fits like size large. The material is not for cool whether, so I returned."
3.0,Don’t like that it is screen print numbers. Was going it was stitched.
3.0,"looks ok, may be a little to long for my need. I have to try on my next flight."
3.0,"These were cheap, but I expected them to be a bit more comfortable. The memory foam is too soft, so it just gets crushed and you're walking on the sole directly. They do keep my feet warm enough and are fine around the house. But I wouldn't want to walk int them too long. I have pretty small feet and they're still a little tricky to get my feet in. Also a little hard to get my heal into, slippers should slip on, right?"
3.0,"Got these to go with neon green gloves, but they are way more yellowish."
3.0,The elbows are not sewn on well<br />And first one ordered was suede and loved and second one was plastic leather type :(
3.0,If your think that this set is super good material it's not . The pants are fine but better if you have curves or else it looks a little awkward. The top or (hoodie) is cheap and thin so be mindful also the zipper is cheap as well if you have big boobs the hoodie may not zip all the way. it's a 7 out of ten a
3.0,"the fabric is great , great quality , but i get hot so quickly wearing this<br />i am living in a 100 degrees weather i cant bare this , sorry"
3.0,These Gel-Pod insoles make my tennis shoes feel like brand new again. I was out shopping for over 4 hours at the mall yesterday and when I came home my feet still felt great. I wear a size 9.5 Wide and these fit right in and I did not have to cut them at all.<br />But they are very expensive so I had to drop 2 stars.
3.0,"The dress I received looks SIMILAR to the dress pictured, but it's not.  If that's the dress you want, you should buy the more expensive dress that uses the same picture...which is what I ended up doing.  The dress I received is not shaped the same on the top at all - the front and back of the tank are cut much fuller and baggier than what's depicted (the tank doesn't curve in at the shoulder, it's straight), and the skirt is short and somewhat see through. :(  Also, an unpleasant surprise, what I thought was just a gathered seam that tapered the waist - nope, it's an elastic waist, which kind of poofs out the top part of the dress, and it doesn't lie smoothly the way I wanted it to.  You know, the way the picture depicts?<br /><br />The dress itself isn't that problematic.  It's just not what I wanted because it's not what I pictured."
3.0,Good price for two  You only need two if you tend to misplace things as they are well built
3.0,Up size by 2 for a good fit
3.0,The top isn't secured enough I can feel that I could possibly flash someone
3.0,They fit great and stay on - even on skinny legs. the length is as expected - not too long and not too short.  They can be a bit scratchy on the inside so I would wear knee high socks with them.  One thing I really disliked about this product is all the shedding!  I doubt these will last more than a few wears.  I did wash them in the washing machine and they survived that but I don't think they will last too long.
3.0,"I know my size and it works great for my foot and heal problem, but my feet are all rubbed red and sore, you put the threads in the back right where my heal is and I got blisters, fixed it by tapping my heal. They are warm and water proof."
3.0,The slits were way too deep for my liking so I sewed them.  The material made it easy to move but Looked a little on the cheaper side. However it’s a good buy if you want to glam up with a Little bling without breaking the bank.
3.0,The  zippers on the  pockets  snag the arms of the jacket  and with this  material  it leaves a nag and small  rips. Really sucks cause I really like the jacket..
3.0,"I can't wear these for long lengths of time because they are too tight and will give me a head-ache. One day I plan to heat them with my embossing tool and see if I can stretch them open a bit more, but they look nice."
3.0,Size runs huge.  Dress not top
3.0,I wanted this sweater so badly that I did not see the remarks that I needed to order a size up. It was beautiful straight out of the pack. It broke my heart to return it.
3.0,I wear an 8 1/2 or 9 sized shoe which is within the size frame for these slippers. I thought they could have been a smidge longer but the width was oddly large.  I have regular width feet and it isn’t even that I was rolling around in them but they just looked REALLY wide.  Fine for an extra pair to have by the door to step out and get the paper or let the dog out but probably won’t be wearing them regularly.
3.0,"The sizing was good, although I tend to have a wide foot, & these shoes are somewhat narrow. Overall they are a very good shoe!"
3.0,Very thick material. True to size but sooo thick it's not float.
3.0,Small over my boobs
3.0,The color fades fast
3.0,"Just the way I like it, long in the bill to protect my face from the sun."
3.0,Great socks but too small (short)
3.0,"These are pretty nice looking, but mine cracked on the back when I was trying to put the card back in? It's not super noticeable unless the light hits it just right, but it did make an audible crack sound and leave visible cracks. Flexing it even just slightly made more cracks. I suspect this is the paint or whatever they've coated the leather in and if this is how fast it starts to crack I have doubts it's going to stand up to travel unfortunately."
3.0,"It looks great, just don't expect to be able to move your fingers."
3.0,fit is good.  lens is a lot thinner than original and more translucent.  we will see how they hold up.
3.0,"You get what you'd except for the price. They look cute and realistic, but the problem for me is getting them on. The earring itself is about twice as thick as a normal earring would be, so it takes a lot of time and a decent amount of pain just to get them through your ears. I'd imagine if you were able to keep them in for an extended period of time your ears would just widen enough to accommodate them, but for me, I have to take them out often due to work, so I eventually gave up on wearing them just because I got sick of my ears being sore for hours every time I put them on. They also don't stay together very well. The earring unscrews from both ends and as a result it's easy to lose pieces, and if you screw it in at the wrong angle, it's easy to break a part of the earring."
3.0,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. The hoodie is beautiful. The colors are amazing, but the size is snug and is usually baggy on her. It is definitely not true to normal size. She was disappointed because she hates snug hoodies, but loves this character."
3.0,"I purchased this skirt as a part of a DIY Mouseketeer Halloween costume. I am a 5'10' and 165lbs. I normally wear a size 12 pants. The smallest part of my waist is 32"" and this skirt fits snug. Thankfully it will work but be aware of the One Size."
3.0,Was okay but not secure fit
3.0,Tight at bodice.  Not accentuating the curves; more like sausage.  The motif is nice.  The cross cross is flattering.  Sent back.
3.0,Posts are short<br />Screw backs are teeny tiny and hard to screw on or off<br />Plastic inserts are painful<br />Look beautiful in the front.
3.0,My daughter liked it but it was a bit small. Will probably order a diffrent one to fit her.
3.0,"The colors were great, but be careful of the size your ordering."
3.0,precious tee shirt but smaller than expected.
3.0,I didn’t like the fact that the product I received wasn’t anything close as the picture.
3.0,"Tank quality was not up to par, but the skirt was fine."
3.0,Cute but too heavy so it sat wierd can't wear it
3.0,"GREEN:<br />I really liked the colors. Colors are very true to picture but the material makes the clothing itself very loose. Poor fitting and makes ones shape look horrible. The material alone ruined this outfit<br /><br />BLACK/WHITE. Very pretty. Fits very well. Good material<br /><br />I am 208lb 5""6 and ordered a XL"
3.0,They slide down after just a little while. : (
3.0,I liked it because of the design but the material seems cheap and there are many little wholes within the scarf. Its ok just to look it but it doesn't protect you at all.
3.0,Not sure what to do these are too big in the length of the finger.<br />I am a small fingered women
3.0,I haven't yet used the glasses but so far not exactly what I expected it would be (robustness and actual colour). Will wear it out and see what the experience is.
3.0,"The picture showed this item as being tied under thechin, which is what I wanted. It actually had a band to attach to your forehead. The band is tight and uncomfortable, no adjustments available.<br />  If you don't mind the tightness, it's a pretty good piece."
3.0,"Really nice quality and appearance, but it's way too small."
3.0,Not as nice as picture.
3.0,It does tear and should show both ends as one end does not have a handle for storing-lifting.
3.0,It’s a cool hat but the lid of the hat is all bent and looks weird. Definitely not wearable.
3.0,Nice and fit as expected but the strings are coming apart
3.0,They look great but you have to take them off to read anything because it is distorted or blurry.  A killer for me.
3.0,"Nice looking watch but I do have concerns over the quality. The band is nice and when it’s set the time stays true (at least for the few days I’ve owned it). My only quality concern is when I was setting the time I had to constantly pull the on the mechanical knob or else it would adjust, perhaps that’s just the design. The band is easily adjustable. Over all a very nice low cost dress watch."
3.0,"Personally, this dress was not flattering at all. Tried it one time, disliked it so much I requested a refund almost immediately. Some body shapes can pull this off, mine is not one of those. I am a size 12 sometimes 14 jean and I thought this added a lot of extra fabric to areas I cannot afford that to happen to. This is a very heavy dress not recommended for warmer weather. The tool underneath adds a &#34;poof&#34; effect. This looks nice on the women in these review photos but on a personal level this was not too flattering."
3.0,I have small hands.  They were too big so I am unable to use them
3.0,Found the neck to be a snug fit -- the way I like it.  Too bad the material is itchy on my skin.  Had to send it back.
3.0,I bought another pair from this company and I loved them so I bought this one next. They fit great. However the pattern is off balance. The two legs don’t match up.
3.0,Really nice but runs VERY SMALL
3.0,I ordered a medium and it fitted small 🙃 should had ordered a large. It's very comfortable. The length of the pants was 3/4 above my ankles
3.0,"The clips bent the first time that I used them. Luckily they included the buttons and after a domesticated minutes, they looked great. I only give 3 stars because the clips are low quality. However, I would buy again because I liked the look of them when the buttons are sewn in versus the clips."
3.0,not what I expected for my self so I gave it to my niece and she loves it.. it arrived on time and pretty box.
3.0,They are just a little loose but I still like them
3.0,"This bracelet is a nice gift idea. However, the one I ordered came with a big scratch in it. I gifted it anyway because there was no time to get another one before my student’s graduation."
3.0,"It works as expected.  I had to get past the overpriceness for the flimsy material.  Now that I see how it is constructed, it would be less expensive to make my own next time."
3.0,"Like the skirt overall, but wish the shorts were a tighter compression and didn’t ride up.  Length is perfect."
3.0,Super thin in width and the material.  Another 59 inch tie that I can barely keep tied.  The catch in the back has no use because the tie is so short it misses underside by 3 inches.  Why do they market ties that fit people who are 5'5&#34; to everyone.  I'm 6 feet and the length is ridiculous on this tie.
3.0,I ordered a medium for my granddaughter. The bottoms fit ( they actually run big but it's fine) The top however runs small and the cups are very small.  We had to actually add an extender to the back hooks.
3.0,"I'd like to love this gorgeous watch but it hasn't been telling time accurately, I have to  manually adjust the time every 2 weeks , it goes about 2 minutes slow every 2 weeks, very annoying. I've had swiss watches before , consistently accurate, but this watch doesn't do it."
3.0,"These frames are so, so cute - I got tons of compliments.<br />My biggest issue with the soft, gooey nose pads tearing after gentle adjustment.<br />I've worn tons of blue light glasses, but never had that happen before.<br />Other than that one spot, they seem to hold up alright.<br />I'm looking into a way to repair them? Or possibly see if it's worth ordering another pair?<br />Here's hoping."
3.0,"[[VIDEOID:fc56c72cc1c81d2d672afc7a718f801]] This shield is a decent version of the Shield Made famous by Marvel Comics hero Captain America. Ole Steve Rogers used a shield that looked like this but his was 2.5 feet across and made of Vibranium, This is good for a kids costume and is not flimsy as a plastic one would be. It has 2 straps inside and a hook for wall mounting. Their Welding technique needs a little work as it causes a slight blemish in the metal where the straps are hooked on. But for a kid this would be a great shield for any kid who is a Captain America fan or even the adult who would just hang it on the well."
3.0,These gloves are so sturdy that they hurt your hands when dishwashing. Not useable
3.0,"So far, I've worn two of these earrings. Both times, one of the dinosaurs fell off. I'm going to set them aside until I don't need to wear a mask and cut my hair. Those two things killed off the dinos faster than the Ice Age."
3.0,I really enjoyed the geta but sadly after about a month the left one cracked in the middle. However this was with every day wear.
3.0,"It's not as nice as pictured. I think the waist may be shorter, but it's still a great coat for the price. Colors are beautiful."
3.0,NOT the set of 3 colors I ordered. All 3 were supposed to be lined. The odd one was not lined!! Quality on the black & light tan is great. Not happy with the grey at all. 😠
3.0,This is not what I expected.  It is a nice shirt and I like it but it is a little shorter in the front then I expected.  The fabric is nice and it clearly stated that it was silk.  I guess based on the picture I was thinking it would be more a jersey or heavier weight.
3.0,"Its ok, not a huge fan of the material it feels a bit cheap. The shape is cute but it doesn't look great with a strapless bra making it difficult to wear."
3.0,"this shirt was pretty cheap cost wise so didn't know what to expect.  it was pretty color wise,  but it came with loose strings and very see through.  I was not happy but when contacted seller they got back to be every single time to help.  they gave me half a refund and I did not have to send it back.  I was pleased at least they gave me half my money back for a shirt I was not happy with and did not have the hassle of sending back.  it was a pleasure to get a seller who at least did what they could."
3.0,"Way too big, wouldn’t stay up. Constant fighting with it. I don’t want to get into the bad habit of touching my face."
3.0,"Very cute suit, I bought for my Granddaughter , I handwashed it in cold water and it shrunk, I also ordered the size 4-5 which is bigger but I should of went up a size even from that"
3.0,They fix me just fine. I'm planning on getting a few more.
3.0,"As expected but nothing to write home about.<br />I don't think I would buy another one.<br />For the price, it is ok."
3.0,Was perfect color and style but was too short on me.
3.0,"I had to give this 3 stars because I had to send the first dress back. It fit perfectly, but had a chemical stain right on the front of the dress. I sent it back and recieved the replacement dress today. Instead of coming in a box and nicely folded the first one, it was thrown in a bag. I don't really mind that it came in a bag, but honestly I think it was one someone else returned. And the belt is missing. I made sure to return the belt like the nice little card they included, in case of needing to return. I do live the dress. The color is beautiful and does fit nicely. I'm just not pleased with the hassle."
3.0,"Let me start by saying that the bead/clip looks great.  I bought two of them to be used with my Pandora bracelet.  One of them closed perfectly and the other was a little loose and the first day I wore it fell and I lost it.<br />I should have returned it to be replaced, but they looked great so I just wanted to wear them.<br />My recommendation is to buy it because of the quality of the bead itself, but if you notice that it is a little loose, return it ASAP."
3.0,Not women/ girls size
3.0,wish you could pull and tighten like a Patagonia friction belt
3.0,"I rarely have a problem with hats being too small.  This fits really snug around my head, almost to the point of being uncomfortable, and there's no way to adjust it.  It's okay looking but not amazing.  I was hoping to use it for an upcoming vacation, but it's not going to work for me."
3.0,very see through.  you will need a shirt under this.
3.0,"I really loved this band. Thick but not uncomfortable. But…after only 2 weeks of intermittent wear, the metal bar the connects the band to the watch broke off. Don’t know if it was a fluke, but I’m sad I can’t use it."
3.0,"However, the recipient wasn't happy that it took a special $7.00 tool (one use: to fit the band to his wrist)...."
3.0,I purchased this item to seal the cork on my Birkinstocks. It did help to seal the cork after 2 applications. However it made my cork separate from the rubber bottom.
3.0,Ok the rhinestone fell off one of the
3.0,Impractical
3.0,"Although I was pleased with the fit and length (I am 5'6 at 180 lb.), the kimono was not the design ordered.  The sash was missing (not packed in the sleeve as advertised).  The material seemed stiff.  I was disappointed in this item and did not think it was a good value for the exorbitant cost."
3.0,"These glasses look exactly like the picture. Dark black with a hint of silver. I love the look of them!<br /><br />Sadly, for me, they are big. They do fit well but are larger than my face so I only tried them on once. I do not plan to wear them but they might be exactly what someone else needs.<br /><br />They do seem built well and would last getting outside in the summer.<br /><br />Received from company in exchange for an honest review."
3.0,Great size but the chain strap breaks very easily
3.0,These are really nice but would recommend a size up because once you wash two times they a size down from your normal size.
3.0,This band looks and works well and is easy to take off and on.  The issue I found are the edges get sharp and begin to cut into the skin.
3.0,"The costume is cute overall but is pretty cheaply made.  My son has worn it to two Halloween events so far and it is starting to rip and fray at the bottom of the legs.  Also, the muscle portion is not attached to the striped portion and keeps coming untucked from that striped pants.  Seems like a piece of well placed Velcro could fix this problem.  The barbell is not included but we made our own out of some foam balls from a craft store.  Everyone gushed about how cute our little guy looked in the costume (that part I love) but we have two more Halloween events to go and I am worried it won't hold up for both."
3.0,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. I gave it 3 stars though cause it has a decent size flaw (bubble looking) on the front that I am not too thrilled about.
3.0,I like these glasses with the exception they are tight on the temples. The spring hinges are not very springy.
3.0,"So first things first, this is a very cute shirt. The saying is hilarious and totally fits my life....unfortunately. The color of the shirt matches exactly the color that is shown in the photo which is good. I'm a preschool teacher and I bought this for a themed week that we had to wear green, so I'm glad the shirt was actually green (not teal).<br />The reason I took two stars off though is because it's a very boxy shirt and it's cut very short. I'm a short girl so boxy tops make me look very heavy, so the shirt wasn't the most flattering to wear. Also, again, I'm short. If you're a tall person, this is not the shirt for you. It will definitely show your stomach. Heck, you can even be average height and if you put your arms up into the air, you may see your stomach. Being a preschool teacher, I bend over a lot so this was not something I was happy about. I considered returning the shirt, but in the end, I decided to make it a weekend only shirt instead."
3.0,Very thin and sizes aren't correct. The large is about a 6/7 in kids.
3.0,Good enough. Not wild about the feather
3.0,"Too small for Medium Size Male hands. They feel like they are going to rip when I put them on or take them off. I see others mentioning they are too big, I personally wish that were the case for me."
3.0,"This is a really nice necklace!  The pendants are gorgeous.  The only issue I had was how short the chain is.  I had to use an extender to wear this necklace, so that it fell lower than my neck."
3.0,Best kaleidoscope lenses! They fit small because they came a little bent. Can't unbend them because they are hard plastic frames.
3.0,Love the style gave to mmy daughter it fit her perfectly
3.0,Cute dress runs big
3.0,"This feels like it's made of tin.  It is SO light.  In person it is very thin, very yellow, and cubic zirconia are invisible and only a couple on the front of the ring.  I don't like it, and it doesn't stack well with any other rings I own."
3.0,The screen was still very dark even with the brightness turned at the highest setting.
3.0,No era lo que esperaba por el precio
3.0,Love the style the material is thinner than expected but workable ...
3.0,These don’t work
3.0,Only give it 3 stars cause the material other than that and the bust area being a tad bigger it’s overall a cute lil top 😍 got a lot of compliments tho !
3.0,You have to have a large bust to fill it out!!
3.0,"Screen protector itself is awesome but the extra back skin does NOT stick at all on the sides. Ended up in the garbage, kind of disappointed..."
3.0,"The double magnets do make it more secure. But the 42/44mm band doesn't fit small wrists. They say down to 5.91"" but my wrist is over 6.5"" and the band is a bit too loose even when tightened as much as possible."
3.0,I got this hat for my husband last christmas and it's okay but not high quality. Over the year it bleached in the sun and now looks brown- was originally black. I'm going to invest in something nicer that hopefully looks better.
3.0,"I bought this as a cover up for our beach vacation.  It is nice and thin, so I didn't feel stifled by the long sleeves. But it's a linen-type material, so it wrinkled really badly.  And because it's thin, it is practically see through.  It did protect me from the sun, though, and it's cute and comfy.  I'm usually a 14 in pants/dress and a large in tops.  This was loose and flowing on me.  It did it's job, was cute, and for the money was just what I needed/wanted.  A note on the embroidery, though: it can be a bit scratchy."
3.0,Short length... more for workout or lounging around house. Not a formal short.
3.0,Very nice for the price but often problems with the zipper.
3.0,Such a beautiful shirt.  I ordered the size per the sizing recommendation.  The sleeves are really tight. I would recommend going up a size.
3.0,"I love how they look but i dont like them and i wouldnt wear them more than a day, to start the metal part is way too short, one pair came  with one of those with the metal part even shorter those i cant wear,  and that pair is the one i tried to wear for more than a day, i shower with them and the wood part fell off and the clear coat  was gone, i wont use them again, the other ones i just wear them a few hours and i try not to wear them if its raining or going to the beach or swimming,  again i love them even tho they are a little too big  but the quality is really bad, the adhesive  is terrible and the clear coat too."
3.0,"The outfit is a jersey material and very clingy, it doesn’t flow. So for $10 it’s fine, I won’t be buying it again."
3.0,"The red color is bright & I liked that, as I liked the style also, but did not like the chiffon material after all.  It was kind of &#34;clingy&#34; and I felt this might be a problem for me."
3.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a very tank top with the lace trim.  The fabric is good quality, nice and thick.  Unfortunately it just does not drape well on me.  It is too box.  It's fine with a blazer or cardigan on top."
3.0,"I purchased the 38/40 Apple Watch band and the as you can see where the band connects to the actual watch it sticks out on both ends and gets caught on things like my shirt. I selected the Green, Grey and Blue bands. The Green and Blue are nice rich colors as for the “Grey” in the photo it looks more like a Sage Green and not Grey. My pants are Grey and this band is not any shade of grey. I will be sending this back."
3.0,I love the concept of a reversible purse but the brown started flaking off and then it looked cheap. This happened after about 6 months.
3.0,"These are a little small and uncomfortable if you wear and 8.5 wide show and although I got two sets I am sending<br />one back.  That said, I did wear one pair in some flats and danced in them for 3 hours and they did not slip down at all.<br />So for those with a little smaller fit, I highly recommend them."
3.0,Bigger than expected. Small scratch on belly is visable.
3.0,"I really want to like these, but they're a bit too big and the fabric is really stretchy. I don't think of myself as a small woman, but these often feel like too much fabric that gets sort of bunched up inside my jeans. I wear a size 6, 8, or 10 in jeans depending on the fit/brand, and I bought a size medium of these underwear."
3.0,Beautiful shoes but the quality is poor. My daughter wore them one time and one of the flowers came off.
3.0,"The color is a bit brighter than I had hoped for but it was still burgundy. Starting with the top 1. It doesn’t really have anything to specify what is the front or the back 2. If you bother at the seams it will tear 3. It rides up 4. The material feels thin but still keeps you just as warm as a full cotton crop top would. Now the bottoms 1. I got a medium, I’m 5’2 and 152 lb and these pants go all the way up to my armpits. 2. The material and the seams are the same as the top 3. It does make the butt look great when fitted properly.<br />I rolled the pants and stuck a thin waist belt around it and it looked real cute. Would not order again though."
3.0,Would of really liked this but the top was too small. I’m 5’3 and about 120lbs. My boobs either spilled out the top or bottom of the swim suit top so I will have to return it.
3.0,These are really thick. They feel more like winter tights. Not what I expected. Don’t feel like doing a return for a $10 item.
3.0,Some of the eye shadows were cracked
3.0,"I like the shape and overall look, but just two days in, the nose guard fell off.  Also the frames are a heavy metal and it holds heat if you leave them in your car."
3.0,So what you're not told is that the leaf on the front is plastic and is held on by these sharp clips on the inside of that hat that poke your forehead.
3.0,Comfortable and soft material. Fits well everywhere except the length - they are way too long.
3.0,Overpriced. Not worth the money for the quality.
3.0,The tunic is very nice.  The only complaint I have is that it is a little small across the chest.  I wear a 36C and it is a little tight.
3.0,This pair is much smaller than others I have purchased
3.0,They are small even for older kids. They smell funny so be sure to wash before wearing. They got lost in the mail forever I was ready to get a refund but they showed up today in time to give them out for Halloween. I ordered several all different designs. I got what I paid for I guess only $1.99 ea
3.0,Its so nice but unfortunately it runs small should of got it a 2x normally im a extra large .
3.0,"Thin material, if it would have cost more I would have returned it. The friggin belt is waaayyyy too small!? Like how the dress fits but the belt can't even touch end to end around my waist??? I bet there's a skinny girl out there with a belt that wraps around her waist twice lol. I will be requesting a new belt since that's part of what i paid for and not a free gift with purchase."
3.0,Just looked better in the pictures than on me.
3.0,pretty tight.
3.0,"I bought several sizes larger than I normally would because others said it ran small. It still didn't fit my top. It looks great on my sister, but I bought it for me. It is very pretty on her though. It is not made for anyone with large breasts."
3.0,It is an all right watch.  It is smaller then I expected but does the job that it was design for.  I did not like the band that came with it was is is kind of small and I have large wrist.  Over all it is a nice small wrist watch.
3.0,"I was really looking forward to these.  I got the set that is multi colored with the different kind of thinner material at the top.  I thought they would be so cute.  I did not expect that thinner material at the top to go up very high over the knee or stay up well but I thought it would look cute bunched up right below the knee.  But they do not go over the knee at all.  When the sock is fully stretched, the thin material barely reaches the bottom of the knee.  I can use these pushed down so that the top material will scrunch up down lower above my short boots.  I will most likely keep them but wanted to leave this review so that other people will know that they are not as pictured.  They do look okay warn as a regular sock and the changed color at the top looks cute.  Just don't expect them to be over the knee at all."
3.0,Pretty but didn’t realize was a maternity blouse.
3.0,The saying goes you get what you pay for.  My daughter was disappointed when she tried it on because the skirt was on backwards & the bows were way off center.  Luckily she had a home ec teacher that was kind enough to fix it for her.  In the end she was happy & got to where it to Noka Kon.
3.0,I've been XL for years and this dress was too big for me - a pretty dress and the material is very soft but it was just too big. I suggest getting a size smaller than you normally wear.
3.0,I didn't like the materials and returned it!  I don't think this would enjoy going into the water.  The shape was also a little weird.
3.0,Super cute and stylish. I have a larger head I guess and they were a little tight and uncomfortable. I ordered a couple random pairs of sunnies and these will definitely be returned. Not an every day pair of glasses but would be good for a pool day or Vegas. Came in a super cool case!
3.0,The size chart provided in the product pictures isn't accurate at all. It says an XL should be the equivalent of a size 16. However I wear between a 14 and 16 depending on the manufacturer and yet this is way too small. The XL is more likely an equivalent to a size 10 or at max a 12.
3.0,Flimsy quality.
3.0,"Is a great band but quickly fades, because of that,  not worth the $$"
3.0,"Very heavy and somewhat thick, not horrible. Just came with a small chip in the paint handle."
3.0,Fit weird I don't like but everyone has a different style just not for me but thanx
3.0,The pin won’t stay straight when you put your glasses in it
3.0,"Runs really small, which I do not like in a t-shirt. So cheap I will not send back but will probably give away."
3.0,"The material it self is soft and stretchy, but forsure a XXL would be a better size and im typically a Large or XL. Unfortunately they only carry up to XL. It kept rolling up because of the material was really stretchy."
3.0,"The dress was super cute but was kind of large around my busy area so I was constantly making sure nothing was hanging out.  It wasn’t very comfortable either, the material is super rough and scratchy on the skin.  I ended up returning it."
3.0,Coming apart in front
3.0,Cute but straps look and feel cheap ...going to replace the strap b4 i give it to my guy
3.0,Runs very small and not the quality I wanted.
3.0,"I purchased, but returned. It was way too tight. I would consider myself a medium (ladies 8-10), but this was an XS.  I did however like that the buttoned down front was entirely stitched and just for decor. I may consider rebuying in a large or xl. The back is also very low cut."
3.0,"I ordered a small due to running large, I usually wear a small or a medium in a swing dress. This was not loose at all, I probably should have ordered a large to fit the way I would have wanted it too."
3.0,It’s not a sturdy belt.
3.0,Color of rhinestones is not the same as the photos. There is a pink iridescent undertone to the stones. Still pretty just not what I thought I was getting based on pictures.
3.0,This watch is a little small and the strap is very short for a man.  The watch is very light and ok other than the size.
3.0,I loved the shirt!! Sadly it had 3 holes in the back of the shirt and I tree away the box so I couldn't return it...wish It could be replaced<br />The black one I ordered was perfect!!!
3.0,"The product picture is misleading...i thought the beads would be the size of a pea, but are smaller than I expected."
3.0,Very thin fabric.  Excessively thin.  Runs a little on the small side.
3.0,The appearance in the picture makes it look longer
3.0,"I love this dress but I think the collar is sewn on wrong! It it was inside out, the collar would be perfect & I would buy all colors! Pictures 1 & 2 is what the right side looks like. Picture 3 & 4 is what the collar looks like with the dress inside out which I think the collar should look if it was sewn on correctly.  If you are able to do this I will reorder or you can bill me and send me one.  Thank you!"
3.0,Rubber rings do not stay on. Lobe width is very thin so the earrings get very yucky and if you swell any they will be too tight
3.0,"These are okay. Not see through like the leggings I bought her from Old Navy, but they’re not going to keep anyone warm. Luckily we live in California so she’ll survive."
3.0,The material is kinda yucky.  I ordered a Medium based on other reviews. I have a larger bust and its tight in that area. Also the dress was falls above my ankles and I am 5'3&#34;.  I did get a lot of compliments on it though.
3.0,"While I love the idea behind these bracelets, they are very small and the rope isn't durable. With the product being pitched as a thing for couples, you would assume that at least one would be sized for a male wrist. These are very small and even when you've adjusted them to the maximum size, they still aren't even going to fit a male preteen. The magnet is strong, but it's only held in place by a small bit of glue and the magnet is stronger than the glue. The bracelet itself isn't made of very good rope as after a few days it started to come unraveled. Again, it's a great idea on paper, but the materials here just aren't up to snuff."
3.0,Lenses easily popped out of the glasses
3.0,"Weird fit, not flattering for me personally, and the fabric wasn’t very soft"
3.0,They were good-looking but I found that the bifocal style just isn't for me.
3.0,It's a very pretty dress but very cheaply made.  It does look like the picture but there is no hem; the fabric has thread sewn around it at the hemline but no actual hem.
3.0,Jewels were sharp and pulled my grand daughter's tights.
3.0,"Really works as advertised, delivery takes quite long"
3.0,Post were bent
3.0,"These are obviously very cheaply made, which I expected for the price. I wore them for a whole day last week and had to pull them up every ten minutes. The lace doesn't sit flat like it is shown in the photo, it rolls down and then the whole stocking will fall down."
3.0,"I actually returned this item. The fabric was too thin for what I wanted, and the straps were very flimsy."
3.0,Large gap between clip glasses and prescription glasses create reflective glare to prescription glasses.
3.0,Pretty but very thin material my daughter wears a 5t I got the 5t-6t and it was too small fit like a 4t.
3.0,Would have received five stars but the one mask that states I am an august woman is a bit frustrated since I didn’t know it said august when the order was placed. Should give the option to pick the appropriate month if it is going to specify
3.0,Looks nice but the belt latch seems to slip at times.
3.0,"Belt is just ok. The buckle is a bit uncomfortable and it feels cheaply made, especially for the prices. The style is nice however."
3.0,Flimsy and cheap. Appearance is good but there’s reflection at the back of the glass.
3.0,They are good and came on time. I bought them for my kids for school.  It does not work with girl and long hair as a face covering. But would make a great headband!
3.0,they don’t glow in the dark & balls easily come off
3.0,"The picture of these ear rings are is not at all an accurate example of the actual color of the product. They are a light blue/green color. I decided to keep them,  only because overall they are cute., They are flimsy and cheap, but that seems to be true with most everything  we purchase on Amazon."
3.0,Smaller than I thought and chain if very very thin
3.0,"Wonderful design but faulty product, the zipper was broken upon arrival. I will be returning this backpack and receiving a new one and holding it will not be broken as well."
3.0,Bought because reviews said would be good for slim child.  My daughter is a 6x athletic with a slender waist.<br />Legs fit great. Inseam long but looks fine.  Waist to big.  Since there is ample room with the 7/8 inseam i Ordered a 5/6 to see if they fit better.
3.0,For this being advertised as an adult sized mask they where a little tight on my face. Graphics where great.
3.0,Very thin material. Love the dress just not a fan of the material quality
3.0,Nice necklace but mine came with a dent in it.
3.0,like the design of the product but is not very sturdy
3.0,"color of the socks are fantastic, but it's a bit too thin and the material of these socks is not so sweaty, so that the socks will wear a foot smell for a day."
3.0,"These are advertised to fit up to a size 15 (US) foot; however, I wear size 12 and these are too small. Additionally, the fabric is very thin -- not much substance."
3.0,I wear a C cup and what I received is NOT a C cup!<br />I advise ordering a size or two bigger than what you actually wear
3.0,Dress was too small and very short.
3.0,The wallet came with a free one but lasted a good 2 weeks before breaking to the point of all the cards and ID falling out. It’s worth the price paid for it but not good for longevity
3.0,"It's cute, but weird cut. It's too big around the waist and too short on the length. Cute with jeans or a jacket, but not as a stand alone dress."
3.0,Bows are tiny. Snaps are hard to snap. Inserts inside come out easily. I would not buy again.
3.0,"It is alright.  I wear a 38B typically and this is somewhat small, my breasts do not fit in it very comfortably, although I make it work.  It is more like a swimsuit top (the feeling, texture and back clasp) than a bra.  But for the price and on amazon prime, you cant really go wrong"
3.0,after I fixed the loose stone that was floating around the bag.
3.0,"The description said the Medium was 31"", and was not the case. I had measured it from end to end and was about 29 3/4""."
3.0,The top is the largest  size  offered and it doesn't  fit well. It rolls up while working out.  I expected it to cover the entire muffin top. Not
3.0,"Not having a separate compartment for the eye glasses, can get scratch by keys, etc."
3.0,CUTE BUT I WISH THE BRACELET WAS LONGER INSTEAD OF IT BEING MOSTLY THAT TIE UP STRING
3.0,Fit and feel very comfortable but the glue is making a sticky mess under my hills
3.0,Poor quality & sewing!
3.0,"I used this as a slip-in case for my eyeglasses, kept in an outside pocket of my purse. The quality is good but it's quite flat, so the glasses don't just slip in easily, you really need an extra hand to open it so you can slide your glasses in."
3.0,"Size 36DD, 175 pounds. Xtra Large. The top barely fit my breast however I still looked sexy! One of the strings ripped off from the bottom but I quickly grabbed the needle and thread and was good to go. I was on vacation in Jamaica and loved it. You get what you paid for."
3.0,"The dress is very nice. The fabric is very nice, not flimsy or see through. The only downside was I thought the cardigan came with the dress. It stated so in the details and I also see others with photos reviews with the cardigan but mine never came with one."
3.0,"I bought it, and i'm happy I did, the color is closer to a dark sea foam green than teal, but it's still pretty.<br /><br />The chiffon part is perfect, but the slip underneath leaves alot to be desired. The quality of the dress is alright, but the main problem is the length of the slip under the dress. I'm a curvy girl (40-34-39) 5', 170lb.  I knew it was going to be shorter (and that's fine, I have another dress where the slip is shorter than the chiffon), but this shift barely covers my butt. And it consistently rides up, causing me to constantly be pulling it down, lest my bottom be shown to the world. Which as someone who is 5' tall, I have never had a problem with.  Additionally, while the dress is stated to be 44&#34; circumference, that is only for the chiffon, which is not clarified. The shift underneath fits me like a bodycon dress, exacerbating the issues. Again, I have a similar dress where the slip is shorter than the dress, but it's also loose like the dress and longer, negating the issues. In the end I ended up putting a waist trainer over the slip which helped a little. But I shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />tldr - don't buy if you're curvy and if you are, try putting a waist trainer over the slip to keep it from riding up too much."
3.0,Three stars for my love of Danganrompa and my appreciation for the fact that these exists. Even though they probably don't have the creators permission to use the images. Knocked a couple stars off because I CAN HARDLY BREATHE while I'm wearing them. It hurts to be beautiful.
3.0,"While I can certainly see how these pants fulfill a purpose, for me they didn't quite work as expected. The thighs are a bit tight for me, and the position of the pockets is such that I couldn't get everything to fit without competing for vertical accessibility. It was a bit cumbersome accessing the two main pockets on either side because I kept guessing where I put my wallet vs passport, constantly getting into the wrong pocket. As a result of the tightness, it seemed it was too obvious I had stuff stored in the pockets so I ended up switching back to my military style cargo pants. Overall, the fabric seems very durable and attractive though. High quality pants."
3.0,Although the size said (China fits small) it is very big because I took a 3XL and I usually Wear L-XL
3.0,Pretty outfit  but a large which is supposed to be a size 12-14  is way to small... Sadly I will be returning it.
3.0,……..()((;;;
3.0,The helmet itself is good but the inside was just glued instead of riveted and secured. For the cost I felt it should have been better constructed. Outside good inside needs improvement.
3.0,"They fit pretty well and are comfortable enough. The front pockets are deep, which is nice until you run, then they flop all over. The rear pocket is not deep enough for my phone and can't zip with it in. So I have no where to put my phone while I run. My other shorts seem to have a bigger rear pocket that lets me cram it, but this one can't handle that. I suggest getting an arm band or a small bag if you insist on these pair."
3.0,"These earrings are fun and decent quality despite their cheap price. The look nice in, but my one complaint is they don't hug your ears like more ear climbers. They have a traditional earring back and so (at least in my ears) the front of the earring is too far forward on my earlobe. Not a huge deal, but based on this I will probably not order again."
3.0,They feel nice but are much smaller than expected.
3.0,Run little big i am size 10 my is Lbut I love it anyway
3.0,Very pretty — color and embroidery. However the cut is straight and doesn’t leave room for hip flare. Runs small.
3.0,"This cell phone case is super cute, but the strap is too long in my opinion. I bought it to use with my purse. I was tired of digging in my purse for my phone. I have seen other women with cell phone cases dangling from their purses, and I thought that this would be the solution to the endless digging into the bottomless pit for my phone. But the strap is too long, and I had to wrap it around my purse handle several times to make it an acceptable length. With a shorter strap, this would be perfect!"
3.0,"Cute, but very few colors that actually go with my child's clothes. Some very off the wall color combinations. I think she's only wore two of them more than once that we received out of the set."
3.0,Very cute but I ordered a size up and they were still too small.
3.0,"I was able to make use of them by taking off the ear loops and sewing it on to another mask.  So if you're up for some craftiness, it works out.  but the were too scratchy even worn over another mask."
3.0,"with an active child this show keeps slipping off, do not recommend if child likes to dance a lot, shoe slips and the heel part bends"
3.0,Looks well build but it says that xxl fits 35 to 38 waist an I'm a 36 anti barely fits making It a lil uncomfortable. So I would need a xxl which they don't have
3.0,The dress fits large on my body but is oddly too tight on my arms. I own a similar dress from another seller and didn’t have this issue. I don’t have extremely large arms...not small but not massive. Over the fit for me didn’t work.
3.0,I work hard and needed gloves for that reason....Didn't take long for these to get holes in the tips.
3.0,"Usually wear a medium, but based on reviews I ordered a large and I'm glad I did.  The material is not the greatest, but it was inexpensive, and shows it."
3.0,Don't think it will last long! Extremely thin band!
3.0,It causes a little bit of pain and it holds ok
3.0,Soft but low quality
3.0,Sleeves are a bit short
3.0,"I truly believe that this skirt is actually meant for a young girl, or small junior size at best.  Which is a shame because the pattern on the fabric is really pretty.  I was going to return it, but decided to hold on to it for my daughter.  It should fit her in a few years."
3.0,"I do,like the scarf, and for the price I will keep it. However, I was looking at lots of options before I bought this and I wanted to wear this with white tee shirts.  And the picture looks like the white is fairly white. But in reality, it is VERY aged and yellow, and looks almost brown. So this would look really bad with a white tee.  So can only wear it with maybe navy."
3.0,"I'm 5'2"" and very petite. This coat fit great in the waist, and I adored the coat from the bust down. The shoulders, however, were too big, and I didn't like the poofy part of the top of the sleeves, which isn't as obvious in the photos. Otherwise it's an adorable coat. It won't repel rain, however, so don't purchase for that reason."
3.0,easy and cheap
3.0,"I am 5’5, 221lbs and this 2xl runs big. I could have worn a large. It’s just a very basic above knee shirt, type sleep gown. It’s washing cold, but the tag says not to put it in the dryer. I’ve seen similar at Walmart for half the price. In the photos I hadn’t washed it yet, but I did soak it in water and hang it to try and get the square pattern out of it as well as the static but it didn’t work. I definitely would not buy it again for this price. It’s Made well."
3.0,Item runs too small for an adult
3.0,"Very soft, filter sleeve should sewn up on one side so that the filter is secure. The picture is fine not great just fine. And when you Breathe it collapses into your mouth if that made any sense. Definitely needs a breathing guard shield and it’s satin"
3.0,Top doesn’t fit.
3.0,its so cute! just super small and is really quick to give you a headache
3.0,"If you have wider hips, may not fit well. Order size up."
3.0,"The glasses are ok for the price , be aware they come in a plastic bag they do not have a case or anything like that."
3.0,"Band is not big enough, no option to make it bigger"
3.0,It's a cute hat but the material is rather thin. It don't keep your head very warm but it's looks cute.
3.0,"The earrings are nice, but I thought they where larger."
3.0,"Cute dress, it was very small in the bust."
3.0,The support is amazing but the cloth has fallen apart already! The toe area must not be secure. I've only worn it for a week and it's already falling off the insole.
3.0,"I liked my assorted color ankle socks. So I ordered the three black/gray combination, a little higher up the calf. So disappointed!! These are a different material, different weave, hard on the skin (they can itch), and murder to pull on and off if you have arthritis in fingers. These three pair are a loss to me."
3.0,"I should have listen to the reviews that the shirt was super short. Beautiful top, but it is a crop top. The shirt may fall lower on someone with a smaller bust line. I kept the shirt because I was wearing it under a sheath dress. I love the wide tie neck and it ties into a large bow."
3.0,Son loved the cleats but the soles from the bottom ripped after only 2 months of playing soccer!
3.0,"Came with a little rip in the front stitching, some white spots (prob from handling) and had a weird smell...like pickle juice. Going to wash it and fit it."
3.0,"I just opened this pack of white ankle socks that I ordered as a Christmas gift for my son. They look used already with ANIMAL HAIRS on the bottoms and a little dingy color! 🥴<br />This is my second order from this company, but may be my last."
3.0,The watch is very good.... just only that it come in function ..... the watch not bring it the seal of off in the dial ... I do not how much it longer last to me before to replace the battery
3.0,"For $98 jeans - I was disappointed.  The wash was lighter than I expected.... I would've liked a darker wash like the picture, but they were more of an indigo blue, not a dark blue.  Also, they fade very quickly, do not wash them often.  I ordered the size suggested based on the size chart but didn't feel or see much of a slimming effect - they fit like normal skinny jeans with an elastic waist.  They were comfortable, but I wish they would've been MORE spanx like.  I was expecting these to make me look tighter, firmer and thinner like they advertise."
3.0,The horn was smashed upon delivery. With the smashing of the horn once worn it would not stay up and within an hour of wearing fell off.
3.0,Very very small I got these for my girlfriend who has average sized nipples and they were to small. Product is very beautiful she feel in love before she realized it didn’t fit. If there wa another size available I would definitely buy it. In closing only buy if you have really small nipples like no bigger then a number 2 pencil eraser you should be ok
3.0,"Way too tight, broke my nails trying to get them on! But once on, they were ok."
3.0,"this costume was beautiful. the problem was it was slightly too big. i bought a small-medium cuz i generally wear medium clothes, i had to take it to my seamstress to have it taken in. also another problem was the hat somehow did not look right to me so i had to re-figure my costume. I bought a tiara/crown and some costume bling and decided to go as an ice princess instead of a white russian and it worked out beautifully as well. a friend suggested that i get a veil and go as a bride which i will consider for the next costume party i go to."
3.0,Love the idea but its really cheap.
3.0,"The pushup bra did not fit me well at all.  The cups are very stiff and were too large.  The bottoms fit ok, but the material seemed a bit thin.  I had to return because of the ill fit.  Price would have been great otherwise."
3.0,"Its somewhat small but its sexy. I had to make adjustment for it to work but I love it, the only reason for the 3 stars is due to the fact that size matters and when advertising a product its important to take that into consideration so as to prevent unnecessary stress."
3.0,"Works ok, but being paper it is super easy to rip. Still functions somewhat even with a tear, but it's getting unsightly as a result."
3.0,"This hat from Jeff and Aimy arrived slightly crushed from the box and I haven't been able to get it to fall nicely. It is not a firm hat and it has soft fabric and brim. I'm sure it is because it is meant to be packed and crushed when traveling. It certainly can be packed, but the result afterward was not acceptable for my wife. It has a wide brim with a black bow in the back. Also, at the bottom of the bag it came in was an adjustable string. However, I have no idea how it attaches to the hat. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this hat I would have loved a hat that was packable and retained its shape better."
3.0,"The graphic is only on the front of the sock, that is a little disappointing. They are comfortable though."
3.0,Works wonderfully over my shoes. Best part is that it feels like 2 different pairs of shoes with or without them on.
3.0,"Run small, rubber dots fall off, but my son still likes them. They'll only last this season though as he has to shove his foot in already."
3.0,"Very thin material and a bit large. I'm 5'8"" 128lb. No x small option"
3.0,for what it is we loved it BUT thats alot of money for it i think if it was half that i would be happy
3.0,"the gold is starting to unravel, beautiful color just wore them once"
3.0,"UPDATE: The strap that I loved broke off the purse, all the zippers broke. I am so sad . I had to change my review. it is falling apart.<br /><br />Exactly what I was looking for; a medium size purse/backpack big enough to carry my tablet, wallet and sunglasses case. Love the handle strap! When I wear it as a backpack and need to pay for something, I can pull the strap and wear it on my shoulder while I reach for my wallet, then turn it right back into a backpack. It also has the built in handle on top which makes it easy carry by hand.  As other reviewers complaint, the smell is very strong and I had to air it for a few days and even then I can still smell it, hopefully it will dissipate soon. I just love the purse design and looks so I had to give it the 5 stars!"
3.0,"Fits more like a dress! Way too big and the color is more lavender instead of a deep purple. The 1x fit like a 2x and the 2x fit like a 3x. After trying to make it work for an hour, I decided not to wear the top."
3.0,Ran larger then expected and it's very see through.
3.0,"Product quality is good, but definitely runs small.  I recommend ordering at least a size larger if not two."
3.0,It only has one size and it's very small
3.0,I love it because it’s so adjustable and fits my small wrist but the little beads that hang down to make it adjustable irritate my wrist
3.0,Didn’t look good on me.
3.0,"Probably return it, as it's too small around breasts and under arms, but the bottoms are perfect!"
3.0,The charge sometimes doesnt hold and i have to leave it on the charger for an extended amount of time.
3.0,I bought this for my neice for Christmas. My brother called and said it was super cute but kinda snug and she will grow out of it quick. So if you have a smaller framed child this would probably be perfect. My neice is average. So I really mean small framed child.
3.0,I order an XXL. I am a 38D/40C . Size 14 to 16 Too bad I have to return it because the top was a little too tight.
3.0,"Decent quality overall, Bu a little large for me. I'm not certain if it 's just me or if that is the way it is normally for these. Since they only come in the one size, there is no way to make a comparison. Still, they are a good value for the price."
3.0,"I got these pjs in the mint star print and loved them on my baby, so bought the outer space ones for her. I felt they were a little pricey for light pjs, but love the patterns and how soft they were (plus, the material is better for warmer nights. You definitely need a sleep sack over these for colder nights). However, this pair arrived and one of the seems near the foot already has a hole in it, & some of the other seems (especially down the legs / side) are already looking close to ripping. You can see the thread pulled between the two pieces of fabric. Also, there was some blue dye (like runoff from the pjs) inside the white clouds which is clearly not supposed to be there. I paid what I consider a higher cost for these expecting quality clothing that is decently well made, but this second pair disappointed. Like I said,  loved the first pair (which is why I have 3 stars), so expected consistency of quality with this brand but did not get it. Can't return them because we've washed them. Unfortunately, I don't think I can give this brand another shot due to the quality. Too bad because I really loved them at first!!"
3.0,They are ok I suppose they were bent though so yeah
3.0,Im still getting used to the high waisted bottoms. Colors as beautiful against my tan skin. Nicely made. Over all I like it. Very comfortable.
3.0,Nice colors and it fits well.  It doesnt have any stretch to it like a regular cotton shirt would but the material is still comfortable
3.0,"I am a female, 5'1"" and 125lbs and the small was way too small for me. I just ordered a large as based on how small the others were, that's what size I am in their measurements. Material is very nice, fluffy and warm"
3.0,"The listing is somewhat deceiving. When you choose your size, the list does not specify that the sizes at the bottom of the list are medium width rather than men's size. DO NOT ORDER IF YOU NEED ADULT SIZE! These only come in kids sizes. Aside from that the listing is pretty accurate and they are what you would expect, a cheap kids shoe with cool lights."
3.0,"Narrow, run small, fingers are far too long and there is minimal flexibility in these gloves. I’m a pretty big guy (6’1” 225 pound weightlifter) and I would need a XXXL for anywhere near a comfortable fit. I used the sizing chart and it’s a waste of time - my hands are 9.25 inches around according to the chart  the XL souls fit me - not even close. For $8 I’ll keep them but they are hard to get on my hands - better suited for women or guys with small hands. There’s a joke here but I’ll pass.<br /><br />Bottom line is that If you have small hands, order 1-2 sizes larger and if you have big hands, keep looking for a better sized pair of gloves. They do work on touch screen phones but they are so stiff it’s hard to have any dexterity when using a phone."
3.0,Little to small for what I expected.
3.0,"The size on fits all should say nobody  that wears size 14 or above can wear this item. Otherwise, very cute. Had to return it."
3.0,"Really cute, but was really short length wise on my daughter."
3.0,I got these to replace straps for my little ones glasses. They look almost the same except for the part where they attach.  It has this weird hook thing that occasionally comes out.  Also it some times loosens up on its own.  It seems comfortable and the size is just right except when it loosens.  I guess u get what you pay for.
3.0,This pretty necklace arrived very fast and appeared to be in great condition when it arrived.<br />The very first time I wore it it fell apart. The links are weak and it detached in two places. It was not pulled on or caught on anything. It just fell apart.
3.0,"Great glasses, but don't leave in car on a hot day. I would have gave these 5 stars, but I bought 2 pairs and both broke in the same spot, when I left in my car when it was about 100 degrees outside. Maybe i got a bad batch of plastic for mine, but these only lasted a week, but i guess you can't complain too much for the price. Other than that these are great looking glasses."
3.0,"I know these are supposed to be baggy, however, it isn’t baggy everywhere. It’s a bit tight on my thighs and butt, which is fine. But since they are designed to be baggy the pockets are made lower in the back and it looks really weird. I took them off and moved them up to wear they “should” be on a normal pair of pants. Also, the stitching that’s on the front waist where the belt loops are do not go all the way around. I also found that to look a bit off."
3.0,"It was pretty but had to return, it runs small."
3.0,"I was hoping for this cloak to suffice enough to use both in public walking around outside, and as part of my costume for Conventions and such. It’s nice enough I suppose. The cut certainly is strange, and it really is just a large piece of felt. I suppose it’s slightly more durable than a velvet cloak, but with the strange cut it falls in a way that makes it difficult to see your costume underneath. It's cute when the hood is down, but when you put it up the whole thing looks weird. I'll be returning it, but I think this is the perfect cloak for someone who wants to do a low-commitment costume for a Ren Faire."
3.0,"I do a spin cycle class three times a week. Yes I sweat and hoped the wider sweat band would help keep sweat from traveling down the arm of my glasses and into the corner of my eye. The band a larger then most, soft and comfortable but really do a poor job of absorbing sweat. Hope that after a couple washes they would improve, didn't happen. Not much better than the smaller sweatbands I already had."
3.0,Pretty blouse but it was too big for me. Will give away to a friend
3.0,Fabric is soft but the whole set just does not feel that great on skin.<br />Baggy.
3.0,"This suit is super cute, but the top seam running across the top of the cups started coming undone after just 2 uses. Also, the underwire is beginning to slip out of both sides of both cups.<br /><br />As far as fit goes, I followed their size chart and it fit nicely."
3.0,"I'll wear these from time to time but really don't fit me all that well.  I ordered the size that Amazon suggested for US markets vs Asian sizing.  So I ordered up a size and they sent me a large instead of the medium.<br />Fabric nice, Color nice shipping FAST!<br />... Impressed... mmmm so so."
3.0,Cheap quality of fabric in skirt and zipper is janky
3.0,"Cheap material.  Item as described, fit was good, very cute.  Just cheap material that will unravel if you wash and wear a lot."
3.0,Nice...  But the top of the lettering was at the top of the ring and somewhat cut off a bit.
3.0,"Very cute dress I have on a size small however, this dress is not for going out you will constantly have to pull it down & fix the ruffles on top. This dress is just for sitting and looking pretty."
3.0,"I absolutely LOVE these boots. They are perfect, except for their life span. I bout them in March and already the heel has broken down into pieces. I attempted to fix them, but no go. So they only lasted about 5 months."
3.0,"Shorts are great looking and fitting. The only thing you have to look for is what I noticed , which is the threading on the waist band.  My first pair I ordered were and still are perfect.  The second pair I noticed the threading was coming undone. I will have to fix it."
3.0,Material is very thin. Dress is a little shorter than I expected. A couple inches above the knee.
3.0,It is big and roomy just like I like my beach wear.
3.0,"This is a maxi jersey tank top.  I  really expected a dress of jersey material that got wider as it  got longer.  or a jersey dress shaped like a triangle (tapered at the top and bottom and wide in the center where the pockets are).  This dress basically straight up and down.  Not at  all the look I was looking for. It is not thin. But if the sun is bright, you will be able to see  your undies.  I am 5'7&#34; and it comes to the top of my ankles.  So it will become a knock around dress. Not something I will wear out.  I could not wear heels with  it. I know it says beach  dress, but the  picture  iludes that it maybe worn casually out."
3.0,This skirt is the most adorable skirt ever...but the sizing was not right. I went by the sizes that were in the description but I should have gone with my gut instinct and went a size up. I hate that I had to return it...it comes in a large but isn't available on Prime.  I try not to purchase anything that has shipping charges. If your waist is maximum 25 inches the medium is perfect for you. Once again MOST ADORABLE skirt I've ever seen but gave it 3 stars because of the incorrect sizing information.
3.0,"Nothing to write home about. Was a little too big for me, but I made it work."
3.0,"I am 5'1&#34; at 125# with a 34C bust and a short torso. I ordered a size L because I have 39&#34; hips but the suit was too small. My C cups looked funny in the B cup pads, the midsection was too short for even my short torso and the bottom piece was snug. I'm torn if I want to return and try an XL or if I'm going to give up and try a different suit."
3.0,Tabs around the neck and waist are too short.  Prefer previous velcro tabs.
3.0,I wasn't unsatisfied but I was not satisfied either. The kimono was a bit smaller than I expected. Also the sleeves are not loose they have a cuff on the end. I ended up not wearing this.
3.0,Little smaller then expected but good colors
3.0,The Samsung Galaxy Gear Charm was light weight and not obviously a tracker. Which is what I was looking for.  But I have doubts about its step count accuracy.  Doesn't matter now because it fell off my wrist last night and is long gone.
3.0,Got my daughter size it was way tooooo small. I’d say get a size or two up.  She’s a 11 in little kids
3.0,"I ordered an XL, and it fit me like a medium! It was way, way too small."
3.0,The ordered an XL put it fits like a Medium
3.0,"I read the reviews religiously here to see how this would fit on me...i typically wear a size 8 in dresses and have 36DD breasts so according to the reviews, i got an extra large but it was too big...def would have gotten a large!"
3.0,"The dress was okay, however, the sleeves were not exactly as pictured. It was more of a trumpet style sleeve. I like the one from the photo more."
3.0,"The elastic straps fell off almost immediately (so don't rely on the strap if it's hanging on your purse or key chain).  The button also broke off of one of mine.  I'm handy so I put a new one on.  These mostly stay in our vehicles, so for very little use, they did not hold up well."
3.0,"I like the quality of this band, but the length is too short.  I can barely get it over my wrist unless I release the clasp."
3.0,"Bag is soft not strfuctured, it will collapse if not full."
3.0,A couple of the clip were really dirty but all the others were cute a.d worked well on my Pandora bracelets.
3.0,"This just wasn't for me.. Also it doesn't come with any instructions on how to use the lock.<br />If it comes locked, just zero all out and then push over the key entry piece. It will open. Took me awhile to figure that one out."
3.0,Tarnishes within a week. It's a pretty necklace and good style.
3.0,ID card and a credit card is about all that will fit. Broke pretty easily after about a month.
3.0,"This was WAYYYYY SMALL, but was able to give it to a small friend. No size larger 😟"
3.0,"I have no problem with the silver earrings in this set. Unfortunately, the gold-over-silver must have nickel in it, because they irritated the heck out of my ears. I tried using anti-itch cortisone cream, anti-histamine cream, then finally tea tree oil, thinking they had gotten infected somehow. This went on for three days. Ugh.<br /><br />When I gave up and took out the gold-over-silver earrings, and just put in the silver earrings, my ears stopped being red and itchy. So it's clearly whatever is in the alloy used in the gold-over-silver, or whatever is used in the electroplating process. I already knew I had a nickel allergy; I can only buy non-nickel sterling jewelry.<br /><br />The function of the earrings, though, is fine. I like that they are hinged. They never come apart when I'm brushing my hair, even if I catch the brush on one of the earrings.<br /><br />The hinges stay shut because they're toothed. Despite them being hinged, the hinge is not big or bulky; it's about the same width as the hoop itself. So you can turn the entire thing all the way through your ear hole and not notice it.<br /><br />Next time, I will just buy the silver earrings and not the gold-over-silver. Normally I wouldn't have bothered with the gold-over-silver pair. But the per-earring price for this pair was cheaper than a single extra set of hinged silver earrings. I only needed one more pair of silver earrings to complete my hoops (I already bought a set of 2 pairs of silver-only hinged hoops, and I needed 6 total), so I thought I'd go for it.<br /><br />Not being able to wear the gold-over-silver pair, though, makes them just as expensive (in terms of the money I wasted on a pair I can't wear because I'm allergic to them) as the single pair I passed up. :-\"
3.0,I like it the jacket fits perfect but the pants can’t be xl they are so small maybe do sizes up the jacket fits perfect tho
3.0,Bigger than I expected. Also these earrings are very heavy and I can only wear them for 3 hours tops
3.0,It's ok not what I expected very thin not weather material
3.0,"It's pretty, the clasp feels secure, but the necklace part keeps sliding so that it doesn't look right. The little hexagonal piece where the rest of the chain is supposed to drop from keeps sliding down to the cage with the Fitbit in it, and I keep having to adjust it, and it's annoying. I want to like this better, but having to constantly fiddle with my jewelry isn't something I ever want to have to do."
3.0,The bra is very big and underwear fits very tight for some reason the tops size and bottom size does make sense
3.0,I was just appointed in the level of support that this offers. I did not expect it to be a compression sports bra but I did expect some support. It's OK to around the house and underneath my tank tops but I would definitely not recommend for working out in
3.0,this was a gift for my very tall toddler grand. I bought a size 4 or 4T; she received a pair of cute tights labeled size 9! She wears them rolled up. She gets compliments on them.
3.0,Light and fits good but not breathable
3.0,No the real red .... like in the photo
3.0,If you have an athletic build they are too tight around your calves.
3.0,You get what you expect for the price! Do not recommend taking apart often as it’s not very durable
3.0,Don’t like the material.  It’s too thin for a blazer
3.0,Very cute they just get faded the first time you wash. The black turns more of a brownish faded color.
3.0,Changes your skin green
3.0,They seem really big and fall off my face and are a weird material kind of like cheap spandex or something I just didn’t like them not my kids of thing but the designs are really good just wish it was a different material.
3.0,Cheap not worth the price and short
3.0,The title speaks for itself. Definitely not wool in any way
3.0,"Beautiful dress. However, if you are busty, don’t get this. It doesn’t allow room for bigger chests."
3.0,they way it is shaped it kind of sits uncomfortably in your nose
3.0,"These pajamas are very beautiful and well made, but they were way too big for me. I followed the suggested sizing provided by the seller and still I received a set that I will now have to alter.<br />I am 5’4, 119lbs, and ordered an L (which was supposed to fit me like an S). Instead I received a XL tag in the pajamas, and an L mark outside the package.<br />Very confusing. Little bit disappointed."
3.0,One of the petals was broken off but I was able to glue it back on. Was going to use as a gift for my granddaughter but kept instead and gave her a different pair.
3.0,I love the color & the way it fits
3.0,These masks are great quality but they are very big. It says kids mask but maybe like a 10 year olds face could fit. The colors are fun and vibrant.
3.0,4th of July party earrings got compliments!😘
3.0,"Beautiful but fell apart, have to keep fixing the clasp ."
3.0,"If you are heavy chested, order a size up.  Downsize, I did that and the bottoms aren’t fitted and the shirt is still a little snug but doesn’t stretch the lettering."
3.0,"I bought this dress, among a handful of others, not knowing what would work best for me for a 20's party. Overall, this is a cute dress though it didn't end up being the one I chose. One thing to note: the skirt was fairly see-through so would require a slip or well-matched undergarments...."
3.0,This fits as expected and it's a great dress but don't wash it because soon as you do the red is going to bleed on the White
3.0,"Covid made me buy this. I, all-of-a-sudden, had to become a barber for my three year old triplet boys, and they hate getting their haircut. Some of the good things about this product are the size being plenty big which allows for full coverage and the bright colors interested them right away. The band that goes around the neck is soft, which is great for comfort, but hairs stick in it and are impossible to remove without throwing in the washing machine. I’m not able to use it for all three one after the other because the second and third child complain immediately about an “itchy neck”."
3.0,A little cheap material but cute
3.0,"I'm 5'3, around 150 lbs,  ordered an XL,  it fits pretty well, could have gone smaller.<br />Cut is great, but I'm disappointed in the material, fabric looks cheap and feels rough."
3.0,Great casual shirt and something a little warmer for the fall!
3.0,It was a bit too large and long.
3.0,"I use these to secure my robe. They are so cute, but the closure is not tight enough. They all loosen throughout the day and I have had many occasions where they randomly come off."
3.0,"Looks like normal beads you buy from the craft store. Bracelets are heavy, not what I was looking for."
3.0,It was very bulky so not flattering.
3.0,It's a little big for my wrist but still a very cute bracelet. Beautiful turquoise color.
3.0,These are not black. I know the colors are never the same but these are blue with flecks of other colors. They look  like plastic.  They aren't ugly and although on the small size are cute for my teenage daughter. I would not buy these again.
3.0,"I am only giving the hat a three star  rating because when it was received the puffball that is on it was not on it it was hanging around it in the box and not attached. While this did not make me happy it was not a dealbreaker for me because I was mainly getting the hat or the warmth and not the little bubble on the top.  I made use of  puff my kitties play with it daily so it was not a deal gone bad.<br /><br /> Now the hat it's self is extremely warm and comfortable, fits amazing I had it skiing with me walking around in the snow and I am very happy other than the one little mishap it's a very very warm  fashionable hat and I do recommend it if you're not worried about that puff"
3.0,"This is a great looking watch and I love the style, however it feels very cheap.  The automatic winder is very loud and sounds clunky while wearing it.<br /> In addition, the movement is very inaccurate and runs about 30s fast every 24 hours."
3.0,"The pole is exactly as described.  I should have checked to be sure the  measurements provided worked for my table. I assumed, incorrectly, that all umbrella bases were of standard height<br /> This one is far too short for a standard  table and umbrella. Again this was my fault as the exact dimensions were provided in the product description."
3.0,Product runs at least 1 size smaller than advertised. The 3x fits smaller than the chart shows
3.0,The black tips are shorter than they appear in the pictures. This made my application time longer than usual due to me only being able to put a minimal amount of product on the spatula. I ended up buying directly from Sprush and I've been happy ever since.
3.0,The colors aren't  as vivid as the picture...also...the picture will make you think there are different textures being used...but it's not...it's all the same material and texture
3.0,Seems to rip easily causing me to buy multiple pairs
3.0,Color is way off that shown in photo. Very dull dirty tan. Sending back.
3.0,This is a very tight fitting jacket. It’s definitely not something that would look flattering on if you’re NOT going for a “I’m heading to the gym” type of look.
3.0,I was really excited for these but atleast 5 sets of duplicates is a little bit horrible.
3.0,"I was impressed with the quality of the stitching given the price, but the material was too stiff and the fit was unflattering. I'm 5'5&#34;, 145 lbs, bought a medium; it was a decent length (not too revealing) but made me look larger due to the waistline and voluminous skirt. Moral: you get what you pay for."
3.0,the skirt in the back could be a little longer
3.0,"I like the way it looks because it justs looke awsome!!! But the material is really cheap, in the picture ytou can see it , but in person is like really cheap.. it fits perfectly tough."
3.0,"5 star rash guard. Love the blue Scubapro logo and it looks great with the blue Scubapro leggings I bought to go with it.<br />But... the rash guard was dirty when I received it. It was packaged perfectly but when I unfolded it there were white marks all over the shirt. I've pretty much summed it up to deodorant marks. There was also a hair tie that fell out from one of the sleeves. From what I guess, It seems like someone tried it on, sent it back, and it was resent to me without being looked over again."
3.0,BOUGHT AN XL.  IM A US 12 BOTTOM AND 8-10 ON TOP.  WHAT'S FRUSTRATING IS THAT THE BOTTOM WORKS OUT BUT THE TOP IS A LITTLE TO BIG.  I HAVE TO CUT THE BACK STRAPS TO MAKE IT TIGHTER.
3.0,I will order a larger size
3.0,They are pretty but the tunnel is a pit long and I have thick earlobes. I found myself pushing them back constantly
3.0,"Not the same in product as in advertising. Size wasn't indicates on sandals, they barely fits. Quality also far away from good. I would say quality  very so-so."
3.0,"Definitely more red than maroon, my nail polish shown for comparison. Also, they’re tight"
3.0,"I am 5'10"" and these were way too small on the legs. Bummer. The shirt material is very thin and cheap but the pants seemed to be nice quality if they would have fit!"
3.0,"Loved the look, but it was too small."
3.0,Color did not match with what I got. It was supposed to be navy but it looks more like black.
3.0,Very pretty to wear at home. Not very comfortable to wear in bed. The velour prevents moving freely on the sheets during the night.
3.0,"Not very high quality, the onesie is at least a 3-6 if not 6-9 month size and the pants are tiny in comparison"
3.0,The top was beautiful but the bottoms didn’t fit at all it was like 9 year old bottoms but other then that I love it
3.0,"The product fit VERY tightly on my adult sized noggin.  I'm talking ""all edges flush against my skin"" kind of tight.  For a child, it'd probably fit perfectly.  Probably.  Edges are rather sharp and cut into my skin a bit.  Padding on the inside is cheap and tends to fall off frequently.<br />  If you want a better fitting product and you have an adult sized head, I'd recommend using something on the inside that will stretch the material out and a really hot blow dryer.  Shove said something into the product so that it's pushing against the insides of it.  Especially around the edges.  Then take the hot blow dryer to the product and get ready for a long and boring time of heating your helmet.  Once it's stretched out and heated, allow product time to cool down.  Then check sizing adjustments by shoving onto the old noggin.  You might have to rinse and repeat said technique again for a better fit.<br />  If there's any length of time between sizing and wearing, you might want to ensure you stick something back into the helm so that it'll retain the new stretched out dimensions.  Otherwise, there's a good chance it'll slooooowly go back to it's original ""I'm going to smash your skull/face"" size."
3.0,Cute and as pictured. I suppose your size may be OK. Slightly big in the band. Coloring and make as pictured. More cute than supportive. smaller bust sizes probably better.
3.0,"These are thin, loose tank tops. There is no compression or shaping. For reference, I’m 5’6”  a 36 DD and 170, ordered a medium and it was baggy in the mid section. Gave to my daughter to sleep in."
3.0,nice laptop but the keyboard sticks and is annoying.
3.0,"You can walk in them, you can skate in them, but you can't do either very well... I got these for my 3.5 year old and I worry about him hurting his ankles wearing these,  especially in skate mode.... I will only let him have one wheel out at a time right now until his ankles get stronger. If we have both wheels out I have to hold him up or his ankles and knees will collapse inwards,  since there is no support."
3.0,The size is not for full fit...the legs are not long enough
3.0,"The band is very cheap quality, it was cracking already when wearing it for the first time. You will definitely need to replace the band yourself. The face itself is nice."
3.0,Does not appear to be a durable product. Have worn only twice and wear is already showing.
3.0,the dress part was cute. the material is nice. but the sleeves were too big and slouchy. looked disproportional to the small figure of the dress.
3.0,These fit like cowboy boots at the top. I wanted to love these so badly. The leather is beautiful they just aren't slouch boots.
3.0,The leggings are a nice material but no matter what size I wear they roll down. The small fits well but it rolls immediately.
3.0,I really think the sweater is cute and I bought a size up from what I thought I would wear  - I wear an XL - XXL.  I bought the XXL and it just fits a little small still.  I will wear it but I have to wear a tank top under it.  No way to wear a long sleeve shirt under it.  Looks great with jeans.
3.0,"I really like the shirt when I first got it. But after several times in the washer and dryer, the letters are starting to curl on the edges. So I imagine they will be falling off soon. I really wish this was screen printed rather than an iron on. I’m really disappointed in the print."
3.0,These glasses aren’t that bad. For 13 dollars you can’t really be expecting amazing quality but they get the job done. They do make a lot of “creaking” noises when you handle them. They were a little crooked but I was able to fix it using a little force. I tend to lose sunglasses pretty quickly so I didn’t want to spend too much money. Just be aware that they are not top-tier sunglasses. Just maintain that perspective when you buy them and manage your expectations. I guess I would consider buying another pair once I lose or break these.
3.0,"It's a very attractive coat, out of the package, but the detailing is subpar, things like pocket sides and trim are barely tacked on. After one wearing  multiple bits of trim on my son's coat need to be repaired.  It is also cut very narrow, if you are a stocky build, this coat will not be sized correctly for your shape. This is very much a coat for long, slim bodies."
3.0,"From a distance it looks real nice, but up close the beads are obviously some kind of plastic. Luckily the string covers the seams from the mold on the sides. I still like it but if your buying this as more than a costume piece I'd say its worth the couple bucks to buy the real stone ones."
3.0,Picture makes it look like it is very roomy but it does not fit this way.
3.0,Love this dress but so disappointed that some of the red flowers ran in the wash. It was washed alone and in cold water but the colors ran. So disappointed as the dress is so comfortable and cute.
3.0,Love the thickness of the shorter but I don't like they roll down on your stomach.
3.0,"Great size, fits my laptop and then some. Seams began to unravel after 6 months though, and edges are losing their red coloring."
3.0,Band really small and board like. Design nice.
3.0,I got three pack the yellow one is not good is very dirty fabric looks like someone try one with makeup very sad blue and red is okey
3.0,The sweater was great but I'm disappointed it didn't come with the hideous man shown in the picture
3.0,Shorts are very comfortable.  Very short though.  Don't fit as long as the picture.
3.0,"It's cute, but it looks more like plastic than I expected."
3.0,The color and material is great but it runs small.
3.0,Runs small and it really scratchy. Already falling apart after one wash
3.0,A little awkward in the mouth but looks good
3.0,Too short to cover bum. Great quality tho. Very soft & warm.
3.0,"I love these socks, but I specifically wanted green and pink and I got a different color way."
3.0,Buckle was not easy to use...good quality but stiff.
3.0,Recognize they are smaller than expected and appear to be casted. They are very small.
3.0,"This sweater fits me, but I ordered a 5x so it would be really big to lounge around in and out fits me like a 2x. I wear 2x so it fits,  but not the way I wanted"
3.0,"They fit a little small. If you have a good sized butt, I would suggest not wearing these. I don't have much of one and I find myself pulling the over my backside quite often."
3.0,"As others have said in their reviews, these are fine from the perspective of size, the case is good for travel, etc. My big complaint though is that they are tinted despite saying that the lenses are clear. They are not. Yes, I realize they are blue blocking, but you don't need to tint lenses for that to be the case - they can be perfectly clear and blue blocking (I own many other lenses that meet that criteria).<br /><br />If you don't mind or want a slight darkening tint to your readers, than knock my review to 4-stars. They lose another star because one of the plastic bits at the end of the arm is loose. Kind of annoying."
3.0,not sure would buy another
3.0,Very cute too but ran too small
3.0,It is a cool looking scarf but very bulky
3.0,"I loved the color of this purse, got it and the zipper on the smaller handbag that comes with wouldn't zip and the zipper pull on the pocket on the inside of the purse fell off and wouldn't reattach itself, granted I was given a refund but very disappointed I really wanted to use this purse"
3.0,Pretty disappointing. Picture and description show this to black. The one I received is blue.
3.0,Cute dress but sized very small. I even ordered above my regular size and still wasn't enough. The lower stars are only because the sizing is way off otherwise the dress is really pretty.
3.0,"Get at least 2 sizes smaller!!! My daughter wears an 11, but needs a 9 to fit"
3.0,The straps were too long it did not fit like the picture.
3.0,"Based on other reviews, I ordered this two sizes up, and they fit okay. Then I laundered them in cold water on hand wash cycle & put them on a hanger to dry.<br />They shrunk."
3.0,"This fit perfectly and had the best flare in the tutu part- stuck straight out! But it was soiled with some kind food or something and appeared to have been worn (which was obviously the case with the way it was soiled). So gross. But otherwise, great fit!"
3.0,Not good quality..
3.0,"This was an impulse buy, I live in the tropics and not sure if I'll have a chance to wear it. The product itself did come flawed with a little dent in the front (looks like moths did their thing) but didn't return since there's no option to get this product on my size anymore.<br /><br />Having said that, I did try it and like to model it every once in a while just to play with the camera. I still love it, though the material is super itchy."
3.0,My foot is to thick for this style.
3.0,"Pockets sag, seams pucker after washing, sleeve length is good. will be serviceable for spring/summer. replacing a beloved soft cotton robe that is just worn out and does not measure up!"
3.0,Runs a little on the small side
3.0,"I gave this as a gift. When it was opened, the spring doesn't flip the front open like it should."
3.0,"Made well, the material isn't too thin, a little larger than I hoped for but my biggest problem is that the shade of black is not as dark as it appears on the picture."
3.0,"This bra is way too small. I ordered my typical size, 36G and even on the loosest band, it's extremely tight and digs in. If you're going to order, I'd definitely order up for band size. I was really looking forward to this bra but I'm really disappointed. Additionally, the straps that come with this bra are difficult to get off. The quality for the price overall is ok.. I may or may not consider getting a bigger size in the future."
3.0,"LOVED THIS VEST! It was so amazing. Worked perfectly for the first month. But after a month, it just stopped working. I never washed it, so it wasn’t that. It just stopped staying on after about 5 minutes. Tried other batteries and same issue. BUMMER because, honestly, I loved this vest and had recommended it to other people AND got it as a gift for a person. So I just hope I had a defective one. Wish I could have a replacement instead of returning it."
3.0,"nothing special, no inside pockets, looks cheap"
3.0,"You have to wash in cold water and hang dry. Or else they will get those little fuzzies all over... my navy pair actually started to do it, the first time I wore them :/ I really like these. Going to try to find another brand elsewhere."
3.0,Kinda snug but she wanted to keep it 🤷🏻‍♀️
3.0,"If the torso section was a bit longer, it'd be perfect. I could still wear it and it just looks more low-cut. I am 5' 5&#34; and about 160 lbs. ...Hides my pooch (belly) well!!"
3.0,Unfortunately this one didn’t work out for me; the off-shoulder sleeves were thinner than I expected and the armpits gaped a bit too much; it just wasn’t a flattering look. The color and fabric was pretty and it was very easy for me to return the dress since it didn’t work. It would probably look better on someone more petite than me.
3.0,"It is what it is.  A large cheap looking ring.  Beyond that, I'm not sure what to say."
3.0,"I got the Hunk hoddie thinking it would be not orange, but a yellow-orange color. I know it said orange but I thought maybe it would apear yellow. But no, it’s orange. I wouldn’t get this hoodie if you wanted to look like Hunk but the hoddie does fit well."
3.0,There was no instrustion or adheseve to put this together with. You got like a oval glass marble(rounded) like piece that fits into the metal but no way for the picture to adhere to the glass or to the metal. No recomendation on what to use. I used hot glue very carefully as i didnt want to warp the picture. It turned out ok so its useable.
3.0,It was nice but had a weird smell when I opened the package
3.0,"I am 5'4"" and about 125 lbs. The shirt is much shorter and tighter fit than the picture. Also, the shirt I received is a very light blue vs the darker shown."
3.0,Cute but the zipper doesn’t work very well.
3.0,Loved it! It's too cute! I purchased it for a friend (female) who's a large but it's too large! Probably should have thought to order a medium since it's unisex.
3.0,These were the only insulated shopping bags I could find. Size is good....can fit one in cart and one under. I am a little worried about the quality because there are threads hanging out but I do not see any unraveling of seams so I won't worry about it yet. I like that they zip closed for warm days to keep frozen items cool.
3.0,Comfortable on the skin Has a pocket for inserting a filter.
3.0,A little tight across the hips.
3.0,"Tunic portion fits as expected - it's loose and looks cute with leggings. Sleeves are ridiculously tight, though, and look comical on anyone like myself who has larger arms. Anyone here figure out a way to stretch the sleeves a bit, to avoid the straight jacket look?"
3.0,More a child's size.  Triangles are too close together for it to fit and average sized frame.
3.0,3 stars bcus the material of this dress is so cheap but cute otherwise.
3.0,"I used it for a small phone/ purse, it is not long enough. The length"
3.0,"Doesn't look anything like the picture once you put it on. For what you pay its a decent dress, just would need a lot of altering to look anything like the picture shows. I'm returning mine bc I'm a size 0 & ordered a small & it fits me like a potato sack. It's BAD."
3.0,It was fine. Nothing special. I liked the photo better
3.0,Got it. Looks nothing like the picture. I’ll still probably end up wearing it though.
3.0,"They don't look as good as you would assume.<br />However, great price."
3.0,"I got these for my husband, who's a big astronomy fan. Unfortunately they're a bit large for him. I love the idea of the universe on earrings. I may wear them myself. I'll still look for something more suitable for my husband."
3.0,"Man, I loved these.  So stylish and comfy.  I'm 5'8&#34;, 135 lbs, ordered the large.  This became my weekend uniform.  I ordered 4!  Now, one by one, they are splitting at the crotch : ( I've reinforced them on my sewing machine, but I fear I'm fighting a losing battle.  Sigh."
3.0,"The LED not perfect ,"
3.0,"Material is good. But this is a Pancho. There is nothing to hold it together on the sides. Doesnt look like picture. It is not fitted at all. Im 5&#34;3 , 145 pounds. It was way too big."
3.0,comfortable but rise up a little bit
3.0,"Way bigger than I thought a small would be. Black skirt was completely see through, hung really low on chest, and was not what I thought it would be. Still a nice dress if you’re the right size and get the legs figured out."
3.0,"Love the item, but not the price.  Granddaughter is spoiled."
3.0,From the picture the stones look more purple and that was what I was expecting.  I did not expect it to be pink as I did not see the color in the description until writing this review.  I bought this as a gift for a young lady who likes purple and am hoping that she likes the pink instead.  Please post a better picture so that people know the true color!
3.0,"I ordered a size large and pretty sure I was sent an XL because that's what on the label and on a sticker on the package.  The Amazon label said L, but I think it was mislabeled. I love the sleeves, but it's tight in the arms. I ordered an XL to see if there's any sizing difference.  The ruching made my belly look huge,  so not flattering without a corset."
3.0,The strap broke in a short amount of time.  It is an ideal size and fits the phone and my cards perfectly for work.
3.0,"It is a little hard to slide on back of earring, but it works."
3.0,A fair few of these were broken
3.0,Really small.  They are cute but the size is very decieving.  Wouldn’t purchase again.
3.0,"Its super nice but runs small , i couldn’t use them :("
3.0,"It's a thin stretchy comfortable material, but don't buy if your kid has sensitive skin. Breaks my 5yr old out with a heat rash every time. Buy cotton if kids are sensitive. Color is nice."
3.0,"Material feels thinner than I expected for a sweatsuit, but may be nice for early fall."
3.0,Thickness is not as I expected.
3.0,"These are low waisted which I don’t like, otherwise very comfortable!"
3.0,Very easy to put on. Unfortunately the springs do fall of just as easy.
3.0,I absolutely love the look of these mask. What I hate is the gems make the mask heavy. It weighs down on my nose which makes wearing the mask very uncomfortable
3.0,she said there ok
3.0,"For the price, these are not a bad deal. As fast as the kiddo is growing, we don't need 'hand it down to the next kid' quality. I recommend sizing up one size, as the material does shrink. For $6 delivered, I'm not disappointed in the purchase."
3.0,Cute little pieces but not subsanable  or  substantial
3.0,You get what you pay for but these earrings tarnished within a month of purchase.
3.0,Light and very cheap but used for a mud run cause I knew I would throw them out after. Don't get these for normal outdoor activity!
3.0,"Although the quality was great, I unfortunately had to return them (at my expense) as the size 4 liners just didn't quite fit into our size 4 boot."
3.0,"The way it is pictured on  the website it  looks much larger than it is/ Look at the dimensions; probably even smaller than what is reported at least it looks that way. It's a  minuscule christmas tree, most suitable for a small child."
3.0,Material is not soft
3.0,"I was very hopeful when I ordered this skort for running as I am looking for a more modest length skirt that will be cooler to run in during the summer months. The skirt fit as expected and looks great, but the inner shorts rode up immediately when just walking. I do still intend to wear the skort over some of my other leggings, but I will continue my search for a longer skirt with stay-put shorts."
3.0,I loved everything about this costume especially how it fit but unfortunately the top is extremely sheer and I’m going to have to add a liner to it so if that’s not something you are willing to do I would skip!
3.0,I wear these under my scrubs. The material is very thin and has begun to come apart in the armpit region. I've owned these shirts for only a couple of months but I do wear them on a weekly basis. I also normally don't get sweat stains on my white clothes but these shirts are noticeably yellow in the armpit area even when treated with Oxiclean. I wash these shirts cold cycle and hang to dry.
3.0,"I have been wanting to get a lace choker for a while and I saw this one and got it. It is simple and edgy. It is lightweight and fits nicely. It is not tight but it is not too loose. Lace can be a bit uncomfortable so I am glad that it fits just right. In terms of quality the lace looks great but I was not please with the closure. It was not apply evenly and the closing clasp were not working correctly when it came in. Although fixing it was easy and quick, it was disappointing. This piece of jewelry is easy to make so I was expecting it to be made well. Aside from that it is a nice choker.<br /><br />****FTC - I received a discount for this product in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review.

3.0,The chain around the waist is too long and there isn't a way to adjust it.
3.0,"Very soft material, but VERY small and VERY short in length. I even sized up to be safe. I'm 5'5&#34; and would require a tank under it in order to not show midriff. I'm hoping it will work for a shorter friend of mine."
3.0,made for men and I knew that but tried anyway.  not for females
3.0,It was for my son but it was tight and he is 12 years old but he is tall but is a nice looking jacket.
3.0,It’s really nice only thing that made me give a lower review is that the top is hard to stay on properly. Needs a button on addition to the belt.
3.0,"The watch looks great, but it would look great a little bigger.  And a little heavier... and a little more substantial!<br /><br />I keep forgetting that regardless of how attractive a Seiko 5 is, it’s not the same quality as a traditional Seiko watch.  You definitely get what you pay for, and while you get a better quality watch than most competitors, it is still a significant step down in craftsmanship from a Seiko."
3.0,A couple beads look like they cracked when they drilled the holes but they used them anyway...no quality control!
3.0,Material too thin too narrow and too long
3.0,There are ribbons for the back of the dress.  One of the loops was broken and the stitching is mediocre
3.0,I love these! They are a great fit and dont ride up like other similar products. I like that they stay in place and the design.  Very satisfied. They did fall apart in the washing machine after about a year.
3.0,"a bit small, but I love it!"
3.0,I thought it was going to fit more like a waist trainer but it doesn't. It doesn't flatten the tummy as much as it should
3.0,"Shirt is softer than it looks, but very boxy looking.  Great I guess if you like your shirts roomy, but for me it doesn't show off any kind of shape...just sorta looks like a sack.  Lace is pretty though!"
3.0,"These are ok, but not great. They are a little bigger than I expected, but it really is hard to gauge sunglasses when ordering on line. These are for use at the gym in the tanning bed, so I am glad they are a little bigger. My eyes feel protected, and the glasses are hanging in there in my gym bag."
3.0,"I needed some nightgowns at the last minute for Christmas Eve (forgot to buy Christmas Jammies!) and these came quickly.  They look really nice, but don't wash well.  Washing really aged them.  I'd recommend hand washing."
3.0,"They are reasonably price and do the job. But being made of cast plastic , they are stiff and remain so."
3.0,Bigger and baggies than I expected. Fabric is thin enough that a camisole is important underneath
3.0,They run very small.
3.0,I anticipated these pants would fit too small - I bought a size up and they fit just right. Zipper fly broke within 2 weeks though. I love the pants enough to get the zipper fixed.
3.0,"It's OK for the price. I wouldn't have purchased it had I tried it on in a store. There's just something a little blah about it. Bought it for my 14-year-old, and she hasn't worn it yet, which speaks volumes."
3.0,I loved these pants when they arrived. But they’re about 4” too long and following the instructions I washed them first and now they look faded. I’m a bit sad. I really love the cut
3.0,"The fit of the shirt is fine, it's a little big, but super soft and comfy, and it does have pockets (major plus for me!) so I'll keep it. I usually wear a size 12/14 in clothing, so I ordered an XL. If I wanted it more form-fitting a Large would have been completely fine.<br />The one problem is the color. I ordered the ""Purplish-Red"" color, I got pink. Not a neon pink, a dark kind of pink, but, pink nonetheless. It definitely does not match the color in the picture."
3.0,I lost mine but it was cut while it lasted They are clearly not worth a buy. I don't even plan to replace them
3.0,Cute. Like alot good quality
3.0,Fits a bit odd and is much shorter than shown in the picture.  Thong is useless for a larger size woman.
3.0,It was very small. The color and detailing was great
3.0,they are cool minus that the came easily apart and not fixable.
3.0,"It's okay for a cute small bag, fits nicely over the shoulder for my little Tinkerbell lover (toddler). But for the price plus shipping and tax not worth it."
3.0,This is a pretty shirt and the green color is nice. It's a quality product but didn't fit me as expected.  It fit more like a junior fit and showed all my imperfections as it was more close fitting.  I didn't exchange for larger because I felt that the material would still show the lumps I don't want shown and the larger size might then not line up at the shoulders.. I was disappointed as it looks so nice in the picture and on the models
3.0,This was a tad bit bigger than a normal youth extra small so for the price I wasnt too pleased. But I washed it a few times on hot and it came out perfect. My 5 year old loved it for his sonic birthday party.
3.0,"Have a small work out area in my basement that I use- these weights are affordable and fit well into a small area like mine but the are a bit combersome when actually working out with them and it’s also in metric, they aren’t ideal but for the price u can’t ask for much more. I would deffenetly recommend this to someone with a small area to work out and a small budget."
3.0,"The photo makes the three colors really pop. When received - not so much. They are pretty and delicate, but subdued. If I had ordered for myself, I would have kept them, but as gifts, they just didn't make the statement I was hoping. Returned."
3.0,I thought it would have a drawstring but it is a decent pair of shorts for the price.
3.0,"Bought this for my daughter’s cat birthday party and she absolutely loved it. Worked great for that purpose. However after only a couple of wears and washes, the bands on the edges of the arm holes began to tear off. Would only recommend as a one time use dress due to the many unique designs."
3.0,I was hoping for a somewhat geeky somewhat cool Mandalorian hoodie this one just looks like a really cheap holowheen costume you get what you pay for other than that it is soft not to heavy not too light
3.0,The bags are made of quality material. It arrived on time as posted. The bags were quite smaller than anticipated.
3.0,"Overall happy, material is kind of thin, but I was expecting that. I just wish they were a little more true to the size of regular aprons. They barely cover the necessary body parts/clothing that need protection when doing something messy"
3.0,"Disappointed! First wear on a run…. Big ole hole! Second sock is right behind it.<br />I really like these socks everything about them the thinness the thin fabric they didn’t make my feet hot, the colors were fabulous. Really wanted to give these a five but the hole on the first wear that kind of did it for me. I’ll go through the rest of the pack and see how they do."
3.0,This dress is very thin which is great for the weather but it look nothing like pictured. It's so thin even beige under garments show. I'll take a picture on the forth. I just ordered a white body suit I'm hoping that will help. The straps are thicker then expected and the f<br />Dress doesnt flow as a cocktail dress. Its basic flat dress
3.0,"Not terrible, not amazing..its just alright. It works with what i need it for but this top alone isnt amazing but the fabric is nice a cool which is a plus."
3.0,I like the shoe . I have 3 other pair . For some reason this pair ran small. I returned them .
3.0,I like the bag I just thought it would be bigger.
3.0,Back light doesn't work?? But love every thing else
3.0,You have to make sure it's snugg on your head or it will fly off!
3.0,"It seems to shape well but the crouch, WAY  TOO BIG!!! I don't know what or who would need a opening that large."
3.0,It's a lot thinner than I thought/from what it looked like in the picture. It also sheds A LOT.
3.0,they chain looks great just that it doesn't close back so good... some flaw in the design.. a little disappointed
3.0,"Chess pouch is good for holding chess pieces. However, the grooved section at the bottom is not long enough to cover synthetic flexible chess boards completely allowing for dirt or dust pickup."
3.0,"The strap that goes around your leg is too thick, which can be a problem when wearing slim fit dress pants. This product is more ideal for loose fit pants."
3.0,I ordered it for my 24month old and the pants are too small. The pants barely fit
3.0,The gloves are comfortable and they keep the water out BUT they're not good when it comes to colder weather. I'm talking wind chills below 0. I used them a lot this winter and when the temps are above 0 they do a good job. It was below 0 a few times and my finger tips got numb after about 10 minutes outside. Saying they're rated for -30 isn't accurate. Overall though a decent glove for the price. Just beware if you live in a climate that experiences windchills below 0.
3.0,Very pretty but the top is made for a taller and slender figure or a very full figured top. Made me look like a peach box
3.0,"Not quite what I expected. I’m 5’6”, 130 lbs, 34B. I ordered the medium, and guess it fits okay tight wise, but the armpits seem too big and the sleeves are too short. However looking at the product photo that does seem in line with it, I guess I just didn’t realize that before. Also, the fabric is soft like fleece on the inside, and shiny like spandex on the outside, which makes it pretty warm. I ordered it as a dance top, so the warmth is a little impractical for that. But maybe others would like it. Overall not quite what I was expecting."
3.0,Good quality. But the brim is not something you can bend and mold. It's just a thing plastic strip that stays straight.
3.0,cute but cheaply made.  u get what u pay for.  it does what i need it forthw price is fine.very flimsy though
3.0,The ear holder is not long enough to stretch all the way back to my ears. Otherwise these are nice. It's probably the right size for a very small head.
3.0,Ok product . Didn’t hold together very well
3.0,Fit well. But see through. Material looks cheap.
3.0,"Super cute, but the hat came off the headband immediately. I was able to fix it, just don’t expect a wonderful quality item."
3.0,It looks pretty close to the picture. The seam around the waist bunches relatively strangely. I plan on making alterations before wearing it
3.0,"Haven’t used it yet, but is very sticky"
3.0,"Has no lenght. Fits at waist. Because of that its not worth $40. If u have a wash board stomach, this shirt is for you. For bigger guys SIZE UP 2X. Great quality material."
3.0,"Way too small, I looked on the sizing guide and it says that my 12/14 rear end should fit the L/XL, nope. So my size 6 daughter got a new pair of comfy shorts that she loves.  They fit her perfectly."
3.0,"It's a nice hat -- if it fit my head, I'd give it 5 stars. It's probably OK for up to size 7-1/4, maybe 7-1/2. But if you have an XL head like I do, keep looking. There is a snap-back for adjustment, but the crown isn't big enough for anything larger than 7-1/2, even if you leave the adjustable back completely open. Disappointed, but they are nice enough that I gave them to my hubby -- they fit his size M head."
3.0,"Actually a nice dress, but the XL was a little too wide and definitely too short for my 5'9&#34; frame.  You will have to wear a strapless bra to avoid a bra strap from being seen. I returned."
3.0,"It's pretty cute, but cheaply made. What can you expect for the price. Stones are small, but a nice blue color."
3.0,"Did not like the feel of material, and the strap reminding me of a camera strap. Others might like it, but not for me."
3.0,"The stitching looks like beginner sewing class, I had to cut several threads and untie back stitching knots on the front of the blouse just above the pockets, after that it was okay. The shoulders are a little wide and the bust area won't fit anyone with a C cup. I am barely a C and the button on the bust, puckers.  It's unfortunate, I like the look of the blouse."
3.0,You can not breath with this fabric. It’s cute and light weight however the fabric clings tightly to your mouth with each breath. You can not talk because it sucks into your mouth with breaths. Overall not worth the money. Unless you don’t breath or talk. For show it’s really cute. I ended up using it as a headband.
3.0,"Didn’t realize they didn’t match, I thought it was 2 pair. I look dumb wearing non matching so they were taken apart and used for other stuff."
3.0,"Love the idea of these matching swimsuits, but the material is a little see through, especially the men’s shorts. Fit was as described."
3.0,"They’re not the best, but I do like them. The paint is a little cheapy, mine came with a scratch on it, but it was small. The paint is also only on one side so they only look good from the front. They’re lightweight which is nice and I wore them for a couple hours without getting an allergic reaction so they’re POSSIBLY nickel free (that’s what I react to). They’re a little bit bigger than a quarter of you were wondering about size. I ended up taking the metal bar thing off of them to make them dangle a little less, which worked, so they’re easy to work around with things you don’t like.<br />Overall, I’d say it’s pretty okay for your money. Maybe I’d spend a little less, idk."
3.0,Not comprobable to size
3.0,The color is a little off.
3.0,"I was originally looking for a matt yellow leather tote bag.  This is way more lime green or what I would call chartreuse color.  As far a it being a Large leather tote.... the leather is not soft but stiff and it will also take time to break in the hard stiff handles.  For those of us who are regular LARGE TOTE users... this is more like a big purse... I would not refer to it as a tote.  Also, the inside has a really cheap plastic lining and phone slots on inside are small.  The top zipper is very stiff and difficult to close... perhaps with use it will get smoother.  Overall, for the money, I am going to keep it.  Not what I really expected or wanted, but I can beat it up for causal weekend use.  Doesn't really meet my needs for a large tote and definitely not yellow."
3.0,I love them I want more colors but they are showing they don’t have any available at the moment
3.0,"I love the colors and the stretch, but they show way too much cleavage. A little is good, but these are too low."
3.0,"I am sending this back.  Not as described.  Looks like the other cheap shiny ones.  This one was supposed to be a nicer textured fabric (as posted in the photographs).  However, it's not as photographed.  This is the same old cheap fabric.  It's obviously a reproduction of a nicer (designer) skirt."
3.0,Ok so I was the brave one and got these even though they didn't have a review. I wanted to wait a few weeks before I made any comments. It's been 3 weeks and I like them. They're super light and modern style. Overall you get what you pay for but if you don't care too much about brand or style these are for you. I gave 3 stars cause my feet get sweaty in them but that could just be me. If they last a while I'd definitely buy again
3.0,"The blouse is very cute but not very flattering, the mid section bunches up for a very unforgiving look.  In the image it appears it would hide midsection but it actually accentuates it. If you have a little belly or muffin top to hide, this is not the blouse for you, it will accentuate the very area we’re trying to dress away!"
3.0,"Great item, material and everything I was looking for. Unfortunately the sizing was larger than expected. With contact from the seller SUPREME DEALERS, they were willing to replace the item which is great right? WRONG. They didn't have the size requested, but the next size up. So because it's adjustable I agreed. The day before I am to recieved the item, it is cancelled. Saying they didn't have it, and now offering me another item, smaller than request, with a different description. Since they were not able to fulfill the replacement, I was charged a restock/return fee stating it's in the description. Where it says for used/damaged items. The communication was clear between me and the seller, bad business practice.<br />Be careful of the sizing, or you just may have to bite the bullet."
3.0,"I ended up returning this. I'm 5'4, 112 lbs and petite build. I ordered the small and even though it wasn't baggy on me, it just wasn't flattering. The dress fell below my knees and because of the pockets, it made my hips look bigger instead of being more form fitting. Thick material though."
3.0,"This is a beautiful purse, nice soft leather and roomy interior.  But it's just too big and the soft leather makes the bag collapse so finding anything in it is difficult.  It's just too awkward and I rarely carry it."
3.0,Could not understand how to charge itand how to set it up.
3.0,Grandson LOVED these shoes BUT didnt get to wear them as often as we hoped. 1 shoe kept dying before the other and then eventually (a week after purchase) 1 shoe would not charge. Had to send back but the concept was cool.
3.0,"87% Polyester 13% Spandex<br />This seems to always happen to me even though I’m not a giant at 5’-7.5”.<br />They are on the shorter side, about 1.5” above my ankle."
3.0,Ordered an extra large got a small.  I will use this product to create something different.<br />Other than that it looks good.
3.0,"i returned it, it was very big, and i didnt care for it when i tried it on , i do think it would look good on a smaller person"
3.0,The image is off center and slightly crooked. I will not be ordering from this seller again.
3.0,"They look great, but when we got them they were bent. My husband had to try and bend them back before my son could wear them."
3.0,I bought this to use as a diaper bag/ purse. I like it but the straps don't stay on my shoulder very well and it's really heavy even with the same amount as stuff in it as my other bags.
3.0,This item was quite eye catching unit it got wet.  It bled on everything. I will update this review when I used it again.
3.0,It's ok for a snowman prop. Not quite costume quality.
3.0,"After reading so many reviews and watching so many YouTube review videos on these leggings, I had such high hopes. They are cheap compared to other leggings out in the market and received them the next day. These are not “squat proof.”I bought a pair of navy and black leggings, thinking it would have the opacity when bending over of any sort - it doesn’t. But it does have great coverage when not bending.  I would probably just wear these for at home workouts but not for the gym. They didnt “wow” me at the end of the day."
3.0,This product is beautiful but it runs at least 2 sizes small.
3.0,It looks fake
3.0,The magnetic tabs are difficult to insert and remove. 😞
3.0,The sheer portion of the stockings caught within the first five minutes of wear and shreded by the end of the night.
3.0,They were very chunky in design.
3.0,"Enjoyed the socks...delivery date changed after I placed my order, so 3 stars.  I would order again."
3.0,Just ok. Not a big deal
3.0,"stones are heavy, concerned they will weigh the scarf down."
3.0,"Very cute purse. The size is just right. The things keeping it from being a 5 star are the shininess, It makes it look cheap. Also, the zipper that closes the whole purse is ill-constructed. I am used to my zippers completely covering the material of the bag. This zipper seems like an afterthought, and it was just thrown on it last minute."
3.0,"So I have to say,  I really liked this product up to the 1st time I actually used it. The 1st time using this was unfortunately also the last time. The strap broke right off. I was so upset and of course the way it broke there's no easy way to fix it."
3.0,I thought it was a perfect fit for what I wanted until it bent shortly after I got it.  If you don't get it in your shoe exactly right it is way too easy to bend.
3.0,I took a shot on these Free People joggers due to the reasonable price point. They were cropped but way too big. The brand runs big anyway but this XS would work better for someone who wears a S or M.
3.0,"Unfortunately I returned both colors in this  top I purchased, while the top is soft and for the most part flattering the material is more see through than I was comfortable with and it does not drape off the shoulder as naturally as portrayed and the neck line looked awkward not off the shoulder also. It does run true to size."
3.0,Its not the same as the Picture but Its cute. The material is a little more cheap looking cute. I would buy again. It looks big before you put it on
3.0,"Meh... is good enough for what I paid, they are very comfortable and the elastic waistband feels very well made but it doesn't look like a casual pair of pants, they look like pajamas."
3.0,Smaller than expected based on picture but pretty. Like it!
3.0,"This a great item, it's quality meteral. Smaller then what I was expecting for my Lincoln Town car hood ."
3.0,"Missing a button, i suppose to close the collar. Wear a high waste bottom."
3.0,Way too long for someone 5ft2
3.0,Good for the price. Not a long life product if used daily. Good thing there were three of them!!
3.0,Good sweatshirt
3.0,Beautiful shirt. Read the reviews and ordered two sizes up...still a bit snug.
3.0,Weird fit. Cute design. Quality fine
3.0,This dress was beautiful but am very disappointed with the color!  It was purple (lavender) more so than the rose pink it's showing here.
3.0,This is thin material.  Perfect for working around the house and getting sweaty or for a personal workout at home.  I would not wear it out of the house because it just feels too thin for my comfort.
3.0,"They're soft. I like them, but I got a medium and they tend to slide down. Not sure if it'll work for running, but as long as you're not running, you can probably do other stuff in them."
3.0,"I like the color of this scarf, but it is much thinner than I thought. Also, be careful to not snag it because it runs easily. I would skip this scarf if you want something that will last."
3.0,one pair ripped between toes.  Would not purchase anymore
3.0,"have not used these boots yet, but I can tell they are going to be heavy to walk around in."
3.0,"Nice mask.  Smelled chemically at first, but was much better after washing.  No filters came with this though.  Shipping took a very long time."
3.0,Fits smaller then it says..
3.0,Didn't receive the clear cover I paid extra for. Will be returning.
3.0,"The gloves arrived on a timely fashion. They are beautiful. The only problem is that they don't run true to the sizing charts. I can't get them on, and my daughter(who has very tiny hands), had a hard time getting them to fit also."
3.0,its little to small for my neck
3.0,These glasses are for adults but they are tiny. Made cheaply. Very thin frames and scratch extremely easy. They'd be adorable and perfect size for a kid.
3.0,"Loved this bracelet, but it was so delicate, it broke after 5 days"
3.0,ok..
3.0,Great pants but the damn zipper opens by itself all the time.
3.0,Very bright mustard color. Fit very large. Bought a medium. I am 5’9 and 145 lbs. this dress was very long and very large....
3.0,Get Caught in your hair too much
3.0,Im a fat girl and this thing is huge! Not a bad quality though it's gorgeous
3.0,Pretty. Chain a bit small in length
3.0,Very Tight
3.0,I received this today
3.0,the color is getting dull
3.0,The color isn’t as dark as the one in the picture
3.0,"Bought a medium, when she unwrapped the gift we all realized how tiny they looked.<br />I told her I'd reorder and we can give the tiny ones to the 9yr old 👀 they were too small for her too."
3.0,The actual item is good quality but the clips are trash and came broken.
3.0,jacket isnt bad...has alot of storage pockets with zippers. my only question is whats up with the hand pockets on the back of the jacket? am i missing something here??? my hands dont bend backwards to put inside my pockets?? is it just me???
3.0,"El tamaño del reloj no se compara para nada en la foto de la descripción, es extremadamente pequeño y no es para un adulto, quizás una chica."
3.0,"Nice, but almost no stretch to the gloves."
3.0,I was in shock when I got them.  I didn't realize how small they were going to be.  I will have to give them to my 8 year old grand daughter.  They are beautiful though.
3.0,Very nice and well made but it was for my son and ran big.  Too big for him to wear unfortunately.  We will keep for next year.
3.0,The shirts are short in the back with shapeless bodies. You may want to evaluate your  imported products.
3.0,Slides around on my toe...was afraid that it would come off so I only wear it out when we wont be doing a lot of walking
3.0,"These necklaces are so cute and on trend! I ordered this one and it's so so cheap. I have a boutique myself and work with wholesalers, let me say that there's 0% chance I would sell this to my customers. It weighs almost nothing and is super long, not at all what I expected."
3.0,"the leg warmers fit OK, but they start to 'wear' very quickly, build up pills, which cannot be removed, so they look worn. I'd pay more for a better quality product."
3.0,I like the design - I just wish they made one that is half the width and the pony tail hole(even that could be half the size).  I  have a small head  - this is very wide.
3.0,Not bad but bend after long time for use
3.0,Pretty but very narrow
3.0,"It's very cute, but go at least one band size up from what you normally wear. It is quite tight around the ribs"
3.0,"The only reason we returned this item is because they were too large, otherwise we would have definitely kept them."
3.0,Hard to put in case because they don’t fold well.
3.0,Ok...but a little too much stretch in the fabric--did not have an authentic jean jacket feel to it
3.0,"They are pretty, but too small for my neck.  Most chokers I have worn were stretchy.  They are very beautiful though.  I would buy again if it came in bigger sizes."
3.0,Very thin.  I wished I had gone to a store to see what 1 mm meant.  It is beautiful though
3.0,Sturdy but chain is a bit long.  Gets tangled up  in other things.  Chain is good quality.
3.0,"Beautiful shirt, washes, dries, and travels beautifully, but it has incredibly long sleeves, too long. Way too long. And given that the sleeves are what draws attention to all the pretty lace and buttons, it looks weird if rolled. I don’t have unusually short arms, but anyone with long limbs would love this."
3.0,"Light, flimsy shoe. Looks nice but the elastic snapped within a week. Waste of $."
3.0,I love the colors but one came unglued all ready.
3.0,"It's more see-through than I wanted, but I can work with it via skin colored bra. The snaps are very difficult and very low quality, I'm worried they'll break pretty soon in."
3.0,"Graphic is slightly faded, but still a cute sweater. Order at least 1 size up."
3.0,The beads are not stone there like a weird material
3.0,"Inside of the shoe came out, the strap material is rubbing off. Only had these for a few months and they weren’t worn every day."
3.0,Just can't seem to get these on with out them slipping off before I can gwt them tight.  Will keep trying because I love boobies but so far having trouble.
3.0,"The band did not fit the watch I purchased it for, I was able to dye it black and use it on a different Skagen Watch. I matched the numbers on the back of the watch and it was a no go?"
3.0,Material is not very pleasant to touch feels cheap. Otherwise fits as on the picture
3.0,"Looks good, just a tad tight for me. But I still like it. Hate that they sent in a envelope and not a box. Luckily, no damage, thus the 3 stars."
3.0,Cute but smells awful and is super stiff and boxy.
3.0,These earrings were much bigger than expected. I will probably just give them away. They look very cheap.
3.0,"This is my third pair of Ft. Knocks but the other two were version 1.0.  I love the frames, am fairly neutral about the changes they made to the hinges, but detest the logo on the lens which could not be removed and can be seen in my peripheral vision.  Small issue but annoying."
3.0,"Too big, sent them back 10 days ago when will I get new ones?"
3.0,Nice but ones of the thumbs is longer than the other and it makes me want to burn my house down.
3.0,A bit fine  or thin chain for active young lady.
3.0,"Fabric was flimsy, thin, frankly very ""cheaply"" made. Too bad as the style very cool."
3.0,"It’s very cute. The color is just not very vibrant. And the color stops at the watch face, so a line of white shows."
3.0,Not impressed with the quality for the price.
3.0,Material is too thin. Doubtful these will last long.
3.0,Loves the design but it was just to big for me
3.0,"Barely fit, cute but wouldn't recommend for actual Pandora bracelet"
3.0,"Classically patterned, lightweight material,  and warm.  Would have liked it more if it had a button or two to prevent it from fitting too loosely."
3.0,These pantyhose fit perfectly everywhere except for the seams in the crotch area. They seem to be too tight and make my thighs flow over in a very unflattering way. This makes them very uncomfortable unfortunately. I really like these pantyhose except for that one fact and unfortunately and I'm unable to wear them. If this seems weren't sown so tight in the crotch area these would be the perfect pantyhose.
3.0,this hat is thin and works great in the summer
3.0,"I really love these, great support, soft and flexible. Only problem I have is I have a very small bust line I'm a C cup with a 30-32&#34;. Finding a bra is really tricky. But these are alright but lose. I do recommende them though!"
3.0,"It is beautiful and my class officers were excited to look at it (it's for the prom queen).  But as we tried it on, three of the small stones fell out.  We found two of them and were able to glue them in, but we need to replace the last one somehow.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because if you need it immediately and the stones fall out you may be in trouble."
3.0,"This would totally have 5 stars if the garment had been constructed correctly. The neckline folds strangely where the fabric won't lie down and its an obvious flaw in sewing. The design, however is gorgeous and very flattering."
3.0,I ordered this for my 4 yr old and i followed the size explanations they put on the reviews and it is NOT accurate.... i ordered a M for my son and it was too big! I ordered same shirt size S this time luckily i'll get it before xmas.... the shirt itself i must say is pretty nice quality and vibrant color true as in picture! unlike some others he's received as gifts.....
3.0,I bought the pocket less style in the same size and they got fine. These re way too big on me. Sending them back and getting a size down.
3.0,"I love this brand of jeans and I wanted to order more. They are very comfortable. I ordered two different color washes of jeans and neither of the pairs I received were what I ordered. The pairs I received are also destroyed/distressed. I did not select this color or style of jean. Both pairs are exactly the same. Again, I love these jeans, but not what I ordered."
3.0,"okay what I expected is all cotton simple style, wrinkles easily"
3.0,its cute but pretty small size up
3.0,Way too small and we measured my husband.
3.0,Ir ordered a medium. The bottoms fit perfectly but the top feels a bit too small. If you have large breasts it will probably be hard to find one that fits without compromising the bottom. The pattern is pretty though and it does seem like good quality.
3.0,Good fit but pockets design reminds me of a clown.
3.0,This sandal looks more on the boy side than girl. It was a little clunky looking on.
3.0,"I love the colors and print of the dress. It feels great. However, I'm a 36DD and my boobs did not fit well in this dress. So if you're big chested, this isn't the dress for you."
3.0,"Cute shirt, but is really small."
3.0,Less elastic in the waist than expected.<br />Description reads 90% cotton when they’re only 60% cotton.
3.0,Watch stopped at times and I had to reset it and the coating started to chip a week later.
3.0,"Was cheap, looks cheap. Good for stocking stuffer but took FOREVER to get (coming from China, always good to know before ordering)."
3.0,"Cute all around top.<br />In the back of the neck there is a small material button loop to go over the little button.<br />Mine loop is so small it is even hard to button before I put this on, so far I can’t!<br />The sleeves are different, and in the ruffle part is a bit tight on me, and I have thin arms.<br />I was hopping I could wear this with leggings. I’m 5’2, wear a size 10, and this is almost long enough!<br />I think for me a size large would have been a better fit.<br /><br />The color is not as bright as what shows on my screen, and is like a gold, brown.<br />I like the color yellow gold on the model better..<br /><br />Washing instructions;<br />Wash with like colors.<br />Do Not use fabric softeners.<br />Do not allow to lay on itself when wet.<br />100% Viscose.<br />Made in India<br /><br />Makes me wonder if I can put this in the dryer, or just put it on a hanger to dry!"
3.0,Doesn't look as good as the picture on the website.  It would be nice if they provide some kind of stand for displace purpose.
3.0,I needed a purple dress for an event..the dress was just not the right shade..needed darker purple..other than that nice dress
3.0,It was too skin hugging
3.0,"So I ordered these before for my Monroe. 18 months later (I know that because I had to go into my Amazon order history lol) I reordered them. I ordered 2 (so 4 altogether). These ones are definitely different then the other ones I ordered. The stud is gigantic! The old ones were tiny and cute these ones are just huge and frankly I hate it. I will be sending the one set back since I already opened the other set. 3 stars for shipping, price, all that good stuff. But these are so not for me. I thought I would be getting the exact thing as before, but obviously not."
3.0,The soles are already coming out. Ok quality
3.0,These run a bit large and the filter is right below the top seam which makes it hard to form on your nose with out a metal band to form.
3.0,"I returned this because the color was not close to the picture - it was gold, not orange at all. There was nothing really wrong with it -the quality was good and the fit was good and it was cute. I had ordered it specifically because I needed burnt orange (football season!) and the gold just would not work."
3.0,too tight on the calf's. but that could be  my calf's.  feet feel great
3.0,Overall I decided to keep. The split opening in the back made the neckline lay a bit weird.
3.0,I use mine as a shawl when the weather is cold to replace my coat because I hate wearing a coat.<br />It kept me nice and warm. I also use it on my settee as a mini throw. Do not let the picture of the woman modeling this item fool you into believing that this is huge.  I wear a size seven so it's big but it's not enormous. I love the colour and the mohair isn't itchy.<br />I definitely plan to purchase this item again.
3.0,I thought this would be much bigger. It is more of a small purse than a bag.
3.0,I quite liked the product but the fabric could have a bit more elastic to support the chest
3.0,Cute but a lot smaller than we expected.
3.0,I wasn't aware that I was allergic to the fabric that they were made out of. Make sure you check that before buying.
3.0,"Although this is a great price, the initial pendant is tiny any slightly irregularly shaped."
3.0,Colors were not as expected.
3.0,"Straps on the top are not as thick as this picture would have you believe. Also, being a plus size bikini I kind of expected it to cover all of my boobs. I am a 34-DDD and I got the large. It was a tight squeeze.<br />Love the pants."
3.0,I like the style but they were much bigger than I expected.
3.0,"Does not look like the picture.  I ordered the appropriate size, but it’s snug - even the shoulder holes.  It’s not cute and drapey like in the picture.  Maybe if you order up 2 or more sizes ..."
3.0,"Love the color.  The fit is snug, but, they are leggings after all. Just would have liked the material to be a bit thicker as these pants leave nothing to the imagination.  I had to return them."
3.0,I want to love these so much the fabric is amazing and so comfortable but when we took them out of the package to try in they already had a hole near the cuff by the ankle. Otherwise these are fantastic pants I just wish the quality control was a little better.
3.0,Not great quality. Lots of flaws.
3.0,"My bad did not realize the printed words ""one day expo"" on the front. Does not make sense. Not great for a gift. Not adjustable."
3.0,Went completely flat and hard within a week. I guess you get what you pay for.
3.0,The shoulder straps are so long they come down to my waist
3.0,"Cute, but the ribbons are too short, too hard to tie on. Really disappointed. I have a tiny head, so I feel sorry for someone with a bigger head."
3.0,"Well, these linen pants feel good, have a nice waistband, and nice pockets. The length is just right. However, they're about 2 sizes too small. Linen pants are summer pants, and summer pants should be loose & comfortable. These pants have that linen feel - a little rough, but if you've worn linen before, then you know it softens up a little after wearing. Ideally if you're slender and then order a size or two up, I think you'll really like these.<br />*Attached is a picture of these pants on top of an equivalent sized pair of jeans (size 12). There's a visible difference in the waist."
3.0,Runs large in the torso
3.0,These are nice earrings for the price. We only got 105 earrings when we counted them out.  So buyer beware.
3.0,They are clown like much to large....
3.0,"Fits well and length is good.  The legs are too tight, narrowing at ankles, I have thin legs.  I would not buy these joggers again."
3.0,Runs a little big and shows lots of side boob but very cute bathing suit
3.0,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT DENIM AS DESCRIBED. DENIM IS A MATERIAL THAT IS USED FOR BLUE JEANS - SIMLIAR MAKE AND TEXTURE.. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A DENIM. IT ALSO RUNS EXTREMELY SMALL... IT IS NOT STANDARD AMERICAN SIZING.. THREE STARS BECAUSE THEY ISSUED A REFUND AND TOLD ME TO GIVE THE SHIRT TO SOMEONE ELSE.
3.0,"First of all, I loved these little nose rings.  They are delicate and unobtrusive, and easy to wear depending on your nose and the location of the piercing.  I easily got it in, but the problem was keeping it in, so I deducted a star for that.  With a little twisting, I managed to bend the end of the wire just enough to keep it in without it migrating too much.  It still does move a little, but it hasn't fallen out.  Normally I wear my nose rings to bed, but because of the small size, I am afraid of losing it.  These arrived in a huge box with a lot of packaging, and when I took out the packaging, the jewelry stuck to the end and sailed across the room.  Initially I thought the box was empty, but I did look around and found the jewelry.  It was packaged in some kind of sticky tape or cellophane, that was difficult to open.  I was not especially rough with it, but one flew out of the package and as of 24 hours later, I still have not managed to find it.  I have no clue where it went.  You try figuring out the angle of incidence and possible trajectory of something light as a feather.  Normally I am pretty good at that, but not with something almost weightless!  Despite the problems I really liked these, and I recommend them, but with reservations.  I reordered another pair and will see if I have better luck with that pair.  I am wearing these during the day, but because of the fragility and small size, and the wiggle factor, I am ordering a pair of closed hoops to wear at night."
3.0,Looks ok; sizing was off; I had to return it
3.0,"Although I measured my grandson before ordering, the uniform was way too large, and had to be returned to China.  The postage was over $50 so if anyone is ordering this item, either plan on major alterations or a huge shipping bill.  The material quality of this item was very good."
3.0,well i have chubby thighs it sucks everything in but it gives me jelly knees. I am 200 pounds. kind of disappointed....
3.0,"I’m 5’7” and XL was way too long,  the Large- it’s  perfect length, but too tight in the bust."
3.0,I like them but iPhones won’t recognize your face when you wear them. I’ve tried resetting my Face ID and doesn’t work.
3.0,quality so so. kinda looks cheap
3.0,Buy a bigger size!
3.0,"The jeans are made well, they will last- but, they are not low rise- more mid rise goes to belly button"
3.0,I like this shirt but was sad that it isn’t old looking like in the picture. I was just a plain blue shirt.
3.0,This came in and I wasn't expecting much. It feels kinda flimsy but will head to the gym with it and see how it holds up. I think it will protect the watch Ultra if It drops but don't want to test it. I would recommend if you just need something to protect your watch.
3.0,"The hoop part is eally big, not wires, and it hurt my ears to put them in. Otherwise, they look nice."
3.0,"The medium size is tighter than I expected. I'm a small person, but I didn't want a sock that felt too tight, so I expected the medium to be just right for the level of comfort I wanted; however, it's a bit on the tight side (but not uncomfortable). Good quality, stretchy material, no manufacturing flaws."
3.0,"This is really small, the picture appears much larger than the product then was. I was a bit disappointed."
3.0,I love this top. It's to small in the shoulders. Its kinda of tight.<br />So if you are a big girl or have big shoulders go up<br />In size.
3.0,"The socks are really cute. However, very poorly made and the thread will easily fall apart. once i opened the package there was already threads on the socks. bought them as a gift but will have to buy something else now."
3.0,Bought a small had to do alterations it<br />Was way too big still battling with it
3.0,"Pretty and unique, the bit of rope it came on was nice and adjustable to a good length. The metal was not too sturdy and could be bent easily"
3.0,"The ring was great in theory, but unfortunately it is so thin that it bent on my finger, and when I managed to get it back to shape, the band snapped."
3.0,"It was way bigger than I expected, but other than that, it’s ok."
3.0,Pretty but needs fixing. The pearl came apart from the pin.
3.0,Not very durable material and fits much smaller. My son is an XL so I ordered a 2xl. It was still very small.
3.0,The product looks exactly like the picture but it looks like it could be used. I was expecting more for the amount I paid.  And it was too small for me. I was looking for a large tote.
3.0,"Shirt and cape is very cute, my grandson loved it; unfortunately it's too small. Since my grandson is barely fitting into a 5 (most 5's are too big still) I ordered a 5/6 but it was too small. Of course he doesn't care so he's running around the house with a tight shirt Lol"
3.0,I returned because it was too small and my size was not available
3.0,Fit & sized way too small. Had to order several sizes up and still not happy with fit. Returned for refund.
3.0,I think this is the size of a child
3.0,"Yep, pins fell out."
3.0,Did receive these earring so i can't give a review
3.0,"Much lighter weight fabric than I was expecting based on reviews. I am 5'4"" 125 and got medium. probably should have gotten small but it is ok. Great print, nice cut. love the yoke detailing. great length, just below knee. but will need a slip underneath. darn it."
3.0,We thought we were ordering a purple dress but received it and it was Fuscia. The lace on the back is kinda cheap so we heavy starched it to make it lie flat. We added a rhinestone belt for the perfect touch. My daughter wore this for homecoming.
3.0,"The sweater itself is made very well with nice stitching and quality yarn, but what I don't like is the overall fit.  It is not at all bulky and oversized as advertised.  The sweater does not have the length of a bulky sweater nor does the sleeves have the full, long, oversized feel I love in an oversized sweater.  Also, the cowl turtleneck does not have that nice, low hanging design.  It is actually like a turtleneck rather than a cowl neck.  I ordered and XL figuring it would be very large and comfy but unfortunately, it feels like a  size medium.  Overall it is a nice sweater, but not a nice bulky sweater and that is what I wanted."
3.0,"These seem to be of decent quality, but they are quite long. They last time I wore them I actually pulled them up to their full length and wore them as above the knee (3-4”!) socks. They did stay up without a problem and my knees may have benefited from the compression."
3.0,"Really like these, but stone came much darker than I expected.  Not like what’s pictured.  Stone looks almost black."
3.0,MY zipper popped off very easy and i cant get it back on track
3.0,0k-nice
3.0,Shirt was much longer on me than I anticipated. It fit otherwise but came to almost mid thigh. I returned.
3.0,The quality wasn't what I expected. Seems kind of cheaply made for the price.
3.0,Looks like flat plastic printed
3.0,It’s not as soft as you’d expect. Not very fitting and came a little small. It’s comfy and warm but I wish it were softer and more smooth to the touch.
3.0,"This is such a pretty set...BUT, upon arrival both earrings and the necklace were all broken. Chain links broken.  I would post pictures, but this format does not have a way for me to do so.  I am hoping I can fix it myself in hopes I don’t have to return it.  So disappointed."
3.0,"It is very beautiful and delicate. Only bad part is that the chains get entangled while you are wearing it,bwhich takes away from the look you are trying to achieve."
3.0,I would advise to go a size up with this product. Most of the reviews state that this dress is short that is a very accurate statement. I'm 5'4 and it is basically the length of a t-shirt on me. This is also not a good dress if you have a larger bust area. I was really excited to get this dress but I'll be returning it.
3.0,I normally wear xsp/xs.  base on the review and the information provided through the website.  I orderer a large which was tiny bit big for me but still fits well.  If you just want something you can throw out after a few wear to use as a tennis skort then this is good buy.  the material is thin and quality is not great but overall is a cute skirt.  You won't be able to tug in tennis ball into those undershort as they are too thin and no hold.  I think wearing an extra pair of tight short would work ok.  if you use it for running this is perfect.  even though it is cute but I don't think I will buy it again because of quality.
3.0,Will return for a larger size.
3.0,"It's not the kind of flowy-soft pima cotton I was thinking it would be, much heavier, and very plain jane. The pockets on the front are not big enough to hold a smartphone. A key, maybe, and a Kleenex. I'm keeping it as an in-a-pinch quick-wear skirt, but would not buy it again."
3.0,"cute,but run too big"
3.0,"Bought up one size to accommodate for possible size shrinkage after laundering. Top shrunk two sizes, bottoms still up one size after I laundering."
3.0,"Its a very nice looking hat, good quality.  Having said that the only problem is that it is extremely large.  An adult head is even swimming in it.  It would probably work well if you were wearing a wig.  I even inserted styrofoam inside to make it smaller, it's still way too large.  Landed up buying another hat at Wal Mart for 5 bucks.  Plan on making it a lot smaller or wearing another hat inside it or you will swim away. Unless you want to look like Baby New Year!  I would have given it 4 stars except for that."
3.0,"While the style and look of this bag is great, it is made of a cheap material easily worn down."
3.0,I might have just gotten the wrong size or something? But they look to be very comfy.
3.0,"Definitely runs a bit small, and it's not long in the torso like the picture suggests"
3.0,Love Cobian flip flops but these were way small. Definitely order one size up. Easy return process though.
3.0,Good for flats or perforated shoes. I wish they had a little more stretch though.
3.0,I liked the glasses but the lenses where a lot bigger than I thought. Too big for me.
3.0,Cute but some of these rings hurt your fingers and I'm worried that the first time my hand comes in contact with water these things are definitely going to change color.  For cheaper trendier jewelry their great!  Love the stones and designs on the rings!  Wish they had a variety pack meaning that some fit your lower finger and some your upper because you can't wear all these in this set at the same time
3.0,The hat in the photo is not what was received. I received a different Kawasaki hat with a patch.  Kept due to it being close to the holiday
3.0,"I just received mine today (June 25 after ordering in end of May). I found it surprising. I tried to show in the pictures—they are a set of pants with a side zip to waist, then the “skirt” part is a shaft of fabric on each side that you tie together at your waist. The material feels very ditto that of a windbreaker. I am 5’3, 163, size 10-12/large, 31 waist 42 hips and the xl fit me like a glove. There is no room for error there, so just be aware of your measurements and check the size chart"
3.0,These are not sweats. They are pretty thin and a little see through. I ordered the grey but they are more like brown. They’re super cute though!
3.0,These are  very pretty and I have worn them twice.  The second time I noticed that one of the stems was quite soft and seemed to bend slightly when putting on the back.  Will be a return if the stem breaks off.
3.0,"I love the idea of this bracelet, unfortunately a few of the &#34;pearls&#34; are oddly colored and look exceptionally cheap."
3.0,Nice piece but larger.  Too large for me. Sent back.
3.0,"This is NOT a sweatshirt.  It is a tee shirt, which was fine, but not what I expected.  Emblem on shirt faded a little upon first wash.  Still ok, though."
3.0,"This set is as pictured; twelve great colors.  However, these ARE NOT scarves.  Each is a piece cut from a larger supply of crinkled nylon (?) of a slightly heavier gauge than nylon stockings.  They are not hemmed or finished in any way, and I found that many of them are fraying at the ends.  It was my thought to use two or more together since they are so sheer.  If you treat these delicately, you may not have too much trouble with fraying, but they will not last very long if used regularly.  I think I will always have to check for fraying ends before wearing these, but the colors are really very nice.  Had I known they were unfinished, I would not have made the purchase, as $12.99 is way more than these flimsy &#34;scarves&#34; are worth."
3.0,"I love the design and material. These masks are comfortable, but are way too large for me. I have big cheeks and these masks were still hanging off my face. 😭"
3.0,This leaves my wrist blue every time I wear it.  None of the other colors do this.
3.0,Cute but too small for a man's wrist. I will return these.
3.0,Plus side: adjustable ear loops are great<br />  Full face coverage with filter<br />Down side: very hard to remove film from<br />  Eye shield portion<br />  Very hot to wear for any length of time<br />Semi- fix: rub the plastic eye shield with a little shaving cream and it fogs less
3.0,Fits weird had to give away
3.0,I like this dress. The only thing I don't like is the snitching of the dress. I wore this dress for the first time 9/1/18. I purchased the dress sometime last year. I felt the lining underneath and the lace wasn't stitched very well together.
3.0,"I like the look, the earring post are slight big. So if you don't wear earring's daily they may not fit comfortably (the earring hole can shrink slightly)."
3.0,Not really a soft feel it’s ok. Light weight and comfortable.
3.0,This is a stretch hat. It wasn't specified as that in the description. Not identical as the black Acura hat.
3.0,The material is not as strong as I was hoping. It feels loose in the places it needs to hug my son.
3.0,The bracelet is very pretty but it says it is 7.5 inches but according to my ruler it is 7.25 inches.  I was so excited that I found such a good buy on a bracelet that would fit but will probably be sending it back as it is not accurate on the size. If you wear less than a 7.25 in bracelet it is beautiful.
3.0,It's ok but not what was expected. Fit at first then washed hung dry and shrunk a little bit. But great product just suggest order a little bigger size.
3.0,"Beautiful. BUT:<br />-1 star for early wrinkled material. The pictur looked like a knit/ sweatshirt material, which is not the case.  It's very thin, and wrinkles easily.<br />-1 star for skinny arms. If your arms... full, these aren't for you. I'm worried the next size up will be too long."
3.0,Too much material at the bottom. I feel like I should be going square dancing instead of to bed.
3.0,I am going to buy another and put them together
3.0,First off it is a cream/ off white not white. The size10 fits like a tight medium at the top with xl bottom.
3.0,"i like the idea, but the material needs to be lined. it would hold the shape better, not show as many flaws and the pink is not light weight, but you would need a long slip. fine for $20 bucks. I gotta return it. would buy it again with different material.<br /><br />i am 5'11 and i wear a woman's 8, 36 DD. this is a large."
3.0,"They constantly feel like they are falling down, other than that I like them."
3.0,"The dress is just like in the picture and I like it, but the fabric is heavier than I expected and although it's wide at the waist, it marks the belly due to the fabric."
3.0,The pin is actually .75” in diameter. Couldn’t use it for what I purchased it for.
3.0,"I bought the white one, and it's sheer. Usually, it's not the case with the colored versions. Since I dislike wearing slips, I'll be returning it. Otherwise, the fit is as expected."
3.0,Wasn't the quality I was expecting but satisfactory.
3.0,What I liked is that they have a ribbed raised bottom of foot. They are comfortable but odd thing is they are really narrow in way when I tried putting them on I really have to force them. They are tight. Not as stretchy in a way like cotton socks I think it’s the sock itself made that way and not as wide as a standard sock. I have another brand of bamboo socks and they do on just fine like any other but this one was as if I’m using a compression sock. Once on I hadn’t noticed it being tight. So far ok but I dought I’d get more. Material is soft can probably b work with dressy shoes since on the thinner side
3.0,Very cute but noisy and they swivel around so sometimes they are backwards
3.0,small in the chest area and lace rips really easy.
3.0,"Good material, runs really small!!"
3.0,Chain breaks to easy . Lost mine in a field mowing
3.0,The gloves themselves look great and seem like they'd be great but the sizing is too big.  I ordered the size listed as 1 & 2 years but my 18 month old will not able to wear these this year.  They are just too big for him and I should mention that he is on the smaller end of 18 month olds.  The tag on the gloves themselves say that they are a size S/M and I've seen other similar gloves list this age group as XS/S.
3.0,"I wear a US size small, always. I ordered a medium based on the reviews and OMG, this was small! So tight around my actual waist that I felt like it was strangling my abdomen. The quality was good though, and so was the length, so I'm thinking I'll try a large, maybe that will fit like a small. Better yet, maybe an XL."
3.0,Smaller than I thought. But looked good on.
3.0,A bit tacky and very big. Fun for a bit but will not wear it often
3.0,"A bit smaller but worth the price, cant complain."
3.0,"The quality of the hat I received is very good & the inside is SOOOO SOFT! I don't know what size my head is, but it felt tight as I pulled it down, but when I looked in a mirror, there was that dang 2 pointy things on top. No matter how much I yanked on it to pull it down, it would just pop right back up. It reminds me of a cat's ears-one on each side of the top. I wore it around the house for about 10 minutes and had to take it off. It was pressing on the nerve on the back of my neck & was giving me a headache. It's a well made hat, but just not for me both in looks and in comfort."
3.0,"Nice hardware and weight, but the 'champagne' version that appears pink on this page, actually looks like yellow topaz. Disappointing, and did not match other pieces she already has."
3.0,Not change for me in night driving
3.0,Pretty shirt. However very short cut scoop in length at front and back. I do not like exposed belly when lifting arms. If very flat chest would fit ok I guess.
3.0,"I really liked them, good quality and super shiny (Like a real mermaid tail), But i didn't realized how short they are. Im 5.9 with a long legs and they awkwardly short on me. The only way to wear them with my boots on :)"
3.0,Not wool! This is a nice hat but this is made of acrylic
3.0,"I love the color of this top and I love the design.  It is somewhat smaller than I expected and I ordered 2 sizes bigger that I normally wear.  Other than that, the material is awesome and I would otherwise say I love it.  At the least, it has encouraged me to lose more weight to fit into it better!  LOLOLOL"
3.0,It's okay. Not bad as a free gift that came with some earrings.
3.0,"I bought this dress knowing it might not fit super well. I have a hard time finding dresses that fit me, so I was taking a gamble ordering this.<br /><br />The fit for me was just kinda strange. Arms were a bit tight, but the rest of the dress was loose in odd places( sides, neck..) Still wore it for my bridal shower and got tons of compliments on it, fabric was soft, zipper functioned perfect, the scalloping on the bottom hit just where I wanted it to."
3.0,Does not come with display box and picture nor description mention they are held to finger with a rubber band. However they do work well.
3.0,"Great fitting for Asians, except there is distortion on the lens. I don't need prescription lens and yet while wearing these, I notice quite a bit of distortion that results in a floating/dizzy feeling and felt quite uncomfortable. I think due to the shape of the curvature, they can't quite get it distortion free. Also there is quite a bit of glare because these lens are not coated."
3.0,Really small jewelry
3.0,"the screws and lace eyelets are plastic and seem to attach well. The fittings do not seem to add too much additional weight and work effortlessly when compared to the standard eyelets in the shoe itself.<br /><br />Although it has not happened yet, I am concerned that the plastic screws will strip out after repeated use due to applied pressure on the fittings. the screws in my opinion are the weak link as they are prone to stripping with the fine pitch plastic threads.<br /><br />If the product fails I will update my review."
3.0,"I ordered this for my wife who normally wears a size 7 1/2. We ordered a size 7, when she tried them on it looked like a size 8-8 1/2, way to big. Other than that they were nice shoes."
3.0,"they are of good quality, but not comfortable.  tops roll down when sitting"
3.0,It has a hinge but doesn't stay open.
3.0,"I made my own mistake in ordering it. The information is there in black in white, and I guess I just mistakenly ignored it. I thought they were going to be large enough for my earlobes. Boy, I was wrong. Notice that these are 1/4&#34; wide! These are tiny! I don't even know WHERE someone would wear this tiny thing. Where would it possibly fit??"
3.0,Product was a great color and great material but too small.
3.0,Too small. And 8i followed the size chart.
3.0,It wasn't as comfortable to wear as expected.
3.0,Its a nice bra made well just aluttle to big its says to order a size up so I did and to big
3.0,No era lo que esperaba. No me parecen que sean térmicos. Mis pies se mantienen fríos.
3.0,"These would be a lot better if they were as described, straight leg. They are definitely boot cut so the description is not accurate, I kept because they are comfortable. I will shop else where for the proper ones."
3.0,"The gems and metal fastenings are really nice, but the actual fabric the necklace is made out of is really cheap feeling! Make one yourself and it will be better!"
3.0,I expected the material to be of a better quality
3.0,"The rings them are a great quality. Just make sure you double check the side you need and don't order the wrong ones like I did! The seller won't replace them if you do, even though I received an email saying they would when I emailed them asking for help I was told &#34;It's a blanket email they send to everyone that buys our products&#34; great ring, great price. Just don't get your size wrong."
3.0,Not a Downeast shirt. Says penny candy.
3.0,Ok. Little tight and see through.
3.0,Didn’t really like how big I̽t was but the overall concept is cute
3.0,Came as it appears but fabric is thin and poorly sewn.
3.0,The dress is beautiful but I will have to put much more $ into it by taking it to a seamstress to get it altered in order for my daughter to wear it. Beautiful work but very disappointed in the way it (doesn't) fit.
3.0,This shirt is super cute and comfortable but the iron on is already lifting after just one wash on the corners of the letters.
3.0,"The shorts are cute, great mid length BUT they roll up if you’ve got any sort of shape to your thighs and the camel toe is creates is so big, the three wise men could have used it instead of the star of Bethlehem. All in all I got what I paid for, color is cute, fit is cute, sizing is good, but the legs roll up and there ain’t a thing you can do about the camel toe except dress it up."
3.0,"The material is odd, like a cheap tablecloth. It fits nice though and is soft."
3.0,"Nice look but the size was too big, even after I carefully following sizing directions. I'm returning."
3.0,I do not care for this sweatshirt at all. The material is very thin and the shape is boxey.
3.0,These leggings fit good but really unhappy that it states it will fit and iPhone plus which is the reason I ordered these and the pocket is really small maybe fit an older standard size iPhone like the 4 or 5 but definitely not any iPhone plus
3.0,"Its a great watch. Especially for $20. I have really been wanting a watch that doesnt run off batteries, so i was very excited to find this. Well it got here and, it is not a ladies watch. Its huge ! It has to be a mens watch. I do understand that men sized watches are,in style but it didnt work out for me so i am returning it. Im pretty disappointed that it is being advertized as a ladies watch :("
3.0,Returned it because it had a strange fit. Super tight across bust area.
3.0,Made well… durable. My grand daughter loves it. Keeps it’s shape well. Giftable!
3.0,Smaller than advertised. Returned.
3.0,lol am i the only one that didn’t realize these were like 3d pearls and not polka dots on the sleeves? belt could have something that actually keeps it attached to the dress. definitely wear a slip under this because it gets staticky as haaaaaale.
3.0,This dress is BEAUTIFUL I'm 5'10 and 210 and not top heavy ..I got a large and it was a little baggy on me .. I'm scared if I get it to fit my body the color may stretch out. Overall it's a must buy
3.0,They stop about 3 1/2 inches below my knee (I'm  5'7&#34;).
3.0,"It's made really well and design is cool, but it's a bit oversized for a motorcycle keychain."
3.0,"Way too small and tight, scratchy material! My daughter immediately took it off complained it was itchy! Not soft at all not like a cardigan should be, sent it back"
3.0,It was hard to listen to people
3.0,My son saw this in a catalog & wanted it badly for Christmas. I don't see him getting two winters out if this thing but he loves it & that makes me happy.
3.0,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loved it but after about 10 wears its has some discoloration. It is very light weight and easily bent. If you are looking for a specific necklace for a specific outfit or occasion I would recommend purchase but not for long term use. This did not cause her any discomfort, skin irritation or discoloration on skin. It was beautiful for first few wears but you get what you pay for."
3.0,"It's a good cheap watch, I got it because the writing is a more dull color then the original F91. You get the same terible backlite, same amazing water resistance. The timer doesnt display the time when it is active but it keeps track of it when you switch screens. I like it because it is thin so it doesnt stretch out hoodie sleeves. Very comfortable watch but gets very irritating after prolonged use. Mine also shipped broken and the straps don't release to replace with a nato strap. That's why I gave 3 stars."
3.0,"This shoe is almost everything I expected but you can't wear for an extended period of time. I wore them while I did my hair and makeup. By the time it was time for me to leave, my feet were on fire! The shoes are so cute, that I wore them anyway...lol."
3.0,"I wish I would have seen there’s absolutely no amount of padding in these bras. Not to “push” me up, but just so I’m not self conscious if it gets cold :( Other than that, they are okay."
3.0,Quality was not as expected but what you get for what you paid.
3.0,Very cute dress. Unfortunately the small was too big. I'm 5'6 110lbs. The whole dress is loosely fit and I didn't mind that however the neckline came down too low and when I tried to pull it up to cover my chest it would fall off my shoulders. I had to return it because it was the smallest size and it was still too big.
3.0,I love the feel of the fabric and the style is cute. Unfortunately it's a bit too large. I ordered a small and when i tried on it fit like a medium if not large.
3.0,"It's cute and doesn't irritate my ear but the rose gold coating wore off almost immediately,  now it looks silver"
3.0,"I was looking for winter socks. My toes get really cold in the cold winter temps. I came across these. The price seemed right for the amount of socks I was getting, so I decided to get them. They were thinner then I expected, but they were warmer then the socks I was wearing. The only thing is the socks are tight to the point that they cut off the circulation to your feet. If you wear them too long your feet go numb. Not recommended for people with large/thick ankles or calf’s."
3.0,"It would be cool, but it's way to big wrapped three times, and way too small wrapped four times. wish I could tighten it just a tiny bit more. Probably won't get worn ..."
3.0,"This is a darling dress.  The material is soft and the cut is true to size.  I feel really comfortable in it. The elastic belt, however, detracts from the outfit.  If it were replaced with a higher quality material, it would look a lot nicer.  Overall, nicely designed dress but the belt needs an upgrade"
3.0,Cute dress for the beach. The material is a little heavy. Having pockets on a dress is always a plus.
3.0,"I’m skeptical of buying plus size clothing garments online due to sizing deviations among manufacturers, and this lounge set is tight on top and fit weird on the bottom of my plus size body. The seam on the pants appears to be a bit off too. Yet, the material is soft and comfy. Nice deep pockets. Just be mindful of NO tumble dry instructions."
3.0,"After reading reviews I purchased my normal size, but when I received them, they were about a size and a half too small.  I ordered a size 10, but could not zip them up comfortably and I don't have a wide foot. I ended up giving them to my best friend who normally wears a size 9, but she couldn't even wear them. I really liked the booties so I was super boomed that I couldn't wear them."
3.0,"They are OK, I wish the waste was a bit higher. Love the material."
3.0,Didn't look good.
3.0,"I thought these were clear with butterflies.  But still super cute. But the design is printed larger than in the photo. I only have one whole butterfly showing on the pair, but I still like them."
3.0,"This bra is okay. There is no padding, it is just EXTREMELY tight around the band. Also one of the hooks came out and I haven't been able to hook it back in since because of the bad sewing. Overall I really wouldn't reccomend this bra. I was going to attach a photo but for the sake of my dignity I chose not to."
3.0,Didn't come with a bow tie and if it wasn't for the reviews I would have gotten a size 2T but a size 18 fit just right for my 2 year old he's also a tiny little guy so maybe that's why it fit so well
3.0,I really loved this blouse. It didn't fit perfectly on me but I can still wear it and it looks great.
3.0,"It's really nice looking. Love the way it looks, but it is made with cheap plastic."
3.0,I bought these once before but they weren't nearly as thick.  I don't want a heavy headband.
3.0,Pretty way to big
3.0,"Looks exactly what the picture shows but its slight too small. Great material and slightly see through; however, its manageable with a tub top or camisole (for me at least)."
3.0,"I love the band, but there were no instructions on how to make it smaller."
3.0,"I brought this for my niece , order the wrong size to tight on her. Had to reorder she really like the dress but i thought it was too short and the material was to thin. She can wear some legging under it."
3.0,"Had a different one before that I loved, it locked in place, this is two parts and is a hassle to put on every day. It works but will not buy again."
3.0,"I can usually suck it in when a large runs snug, but this was skin tight. It fits my 13 year old daughter  pretty well"
3.0,These are really soft but smaller than I expected.  We mostly use these when we are out and about.  We use the blankets from the hospital they swaddle the baby in for more coverage of our clothes and shoulder
3.0,"When wearing, there were a lot of distracting reflections off the inside of the glasses.  I live in a sunny area at altitude, so it may be more of a problem here than some other places."
3.0,"I purchased several of these for Christmas gifts. They NEVER wear them. They are big and will hold a large phone, which I don't own, or I would have bought one for myself."
3.0,it is bigger than the picture
3.0,"Soft, warm, cute socks, but too snug on my size-9 feet. If you have any mass to your calf muscles at all, you will find these socks are just not comfy on the legs either. ."
3.0,"The top of the dress fits really well, I am 5'9"" and this dress is about 3"" too short."
3.0,1 of the bras was EXTREMELY itchy. The others were fine and fit really well with a nice shape.
3.0,I'm missing rhinestones. They fell off in the eyeglass holder.
3.0,"Very nice product, but I wasn't expecting the size and some other writing to be on the bottom in white (on the black sock).  That was very disappointing, but otherwise they are very cute."
3.0,"This is very cute, but slightly smaller than expected. The photos gave me the impression that it would be really flowy (to kind of wrap up in... but it only overlaps a bit in the front), that the sleeves went to the elbows (they stop a noticeably shorter on me), and that the arm-holes were very wide (they aren't TOO small, but they are smaller than ideal, so when I raise my arms the wrap shifts with my arms).  I am plus-size (dress size 18-20, or 2XL).  I researched a lot before choosing this one, and ended up a little disappointed.<br /><br />However, the price was right!  And I do like the fringe at the bottom, as well as the fact that it is long enough easily to cover my rear end.  No worrying about that.<br /><br />Overall, it probably won't be my go-to cover-up, but it's cute enough to keep.  I am sure it would be perfect for someone who normally wears an XL or smaller."
3.0,I don’t particularly like the spandex material persay almost kinda swimsuit like but it is a gorgeous dress I ordered the medium I should have went small I’m 5 3 and a half and 145lbs
3.0,I was kinda disappointed when I tried it because it was large on me. it was just a straight dress; the belt didn't even help.<br />May be somebody with a small waist and large hips with make it work.<br />I was hoping to look just a bit like the person in the picture but it wasn't working for me. I have to return it.
3.0,"Even though shrinking should not be an issue on synthetics, this shirt still had an issue after it’s first gentle cycle.  The stitching shrunk and it obvious on the front of the shirt where the colors change.  Shirt doesn’t rest flat any longer, instead has waves on it along the stictch lines.  Easy quality issue to fix my manufacturer, but will it buy this brand against."
3.0,I usually wear a 13 got the xx large was way too small
3.0,"Beautiful, but after a month the part that says &#34;organ donor&#34; started to peel off, so I had to glue it back on, and the silver has already started to fade off, leaving the brown underneath."
3.0,Based on the sizing guide I expected it to be less tight. It’s very fitted.
3.0,"Very cute, but small"
3.0,Lindo pero se porte muy rápido
3.0,"I  picked a large and a extra large both fit alittle small , lots of compliments from people for the style tho."
3.0,Love this set but the mushroom are much larger than I expected.
3.0,Large for a women's small face.
3.0,"Love the jacket! Would give it 5 stars but the hood has a defect. One of the elastic band snaps is broken and won't latch onto the elastic band. Emailed the seller and hoping to hear back to get another hood mailed out. If I don't hear back I guess I'll have to return it. Other than that, great warm jacket!"
3.0,"I’m in between sizes, but had though I could wear a small since most of my existing tennis skirts are a small. These were like a junior small. I should have ordered up. I ended it up giving it away to a friend as exchanging /returning it was too time consuming. I was needing it for a July tournament and my size and delivery times wasn’t fitting for my timeline."
3.0,The sizing it way off. They assured me it's a kid size 1 but too big for my 6 yr old! I actually fit it. I'm a women 7.5/8!!!!<br />Other wise a cute good quality pool shoes.
3.0,It did not come as picture showed..it came flat as  picture showed it twisted.
3.0,"Nice buckel, leather not as flexible as expected"
3.0,"They fit and she doesn't mind them on, improvement could make them a 5 star, if the height length was increased by 2-3&#34;inches."
3.0,"The top was ok ,"
3.0,Más pequeño de lo que parece es como para una adolescente o muy joven
3.0,They dont work well at all if you wear glasses
3.0,very casual
3.0,"This is an impractical key ring that will quickly pick up any dirt in your bag..I think that young girls will love it, however."
3.0,To small for my big head. Cheep plastic lens means they shine in your eye if you look anywhere near the sun. Too bulky to stay tucked in your shirt color if you bend over at all. I would not of bought them if could of tried them on first like in a brick and motor store.<br /><br />Very dark and little gaps around the face for light to get right in your eye.
3.0,It's nice but sits very short  and I have a short torso. Nice cheap shirt I wore to a concert but had to wear a long black Cami underneath
3.0,"After one wash they shrunk enough that even though I bought talls, I can only wear them with flat shoes and they still feel like 1/2 "" too short.  I am 155 lbs. and 5.9 1/2"" tall."
3.0,"We really like these bracelets, but the men's bracelet clasp doesn't hold very well.  It's come undone on many occasions and he's afraid one day it will come undone and not catch it before it's lost.  Mine hold's a little better, but I don't wear mine every day like he does.  In the few times I've worn it, it has come undone twice, but both times I was able to catch it before it fell off.  Otherwise, I'd give these 5 stars...if only for the clasps."
3.0,"I ended up having to size up which is fine. But even after sizing up, they were not flattering. They were eaten up, if you catch my drift, and they rolled down often. Otherwise they were comfortable and pretty squat proof which was unfortunate. If I went even bigger they wouldn’t look right"
3.0,Very thin through the middle. A little baggy. The arms a a little tight but I like it. It’s really pretty and soft.
3.0,"I will follow up when I get the XL, but I have never received a NEW item that smelled like Gain laundry detergent. It is a distinct odor that always reminds me of my SIL and neice. I am now worried something gross was going on and it needed to be laundered. Really pissed off!!!!"
3.0,I ordfered 2 pieces. I received 1 piece.
3.0,"Very cute skirt. Material reminds me of workout pants. I bought this for my daughter, she seems happy with it."
3.0,"Much smaller than I expect and it shrunk when I washed it. I wear medium (5ft8)and ordered large. looks like a long top, not a dress and was tight around armpit area. Model must be like under 5ft tall.<br />But I like the design , the material is good for the heat. .just order 2 to 3 sizes up if you want the  comfortable roomy feel and careful how you dry it."
3.0,Shrunk significantly after a couple of machine washes.
3.0,"Product shipped fast , super comfy but im 8 months pregnant and ordered a medium and still too large!"
3.0,looked exactly like the photo except for some of them were broken when I received it.
3.0,"Let me start off by saying my boobs looked great. Very sexy, pushed them up, but the band was way too tight yet the straps were way too loose. So I can't even order up a size because then it would definitely be way off. I ordered an XL Which is what I normally wear 38/40-C"
3.0,soaked it and stretched it out a bit to fit.
3.0,Cute mermaid pants but started cracking after one use.  I’m afraid to wash them.
3.0,"These earrings are super cute and it’s a nice small size. I don’t think they are sterling silver though, I’ve never had an issue with sterling earrings before and these make my ears very sore when I put them in. My ears feel fine after I’ve worn them so I’ll probably keep them, but not happy they hurt to put in."
3.0,"Its beautiful to look at and sturdy, but the longer links interfere with the chain's ability to stay flexible; it easily twists and clumps while being worn. So if you plan on wearing this only sparingly, this chain is a great option."
3.0,"dont stay on that well, lots of re-adjusting throughout the day."
3.0,The material super sucks. It's like nylon. Super thin and super see through. Not what you want or expect. I like the style and colors. I will wear it. But it's not the wow factor that I wanted. It's ok
3.0,It runs big. Honestly you get what your paying for. Still kind of disappointed. The material of the sweater though is pretty good.
3.0,"The bracelet themselves are cute but we had a couple volleyball mixed in with our softball pack so we were short of what we needed. I needed 30 softball, not 27"
3.0,I love the texture but they slide down because they are to small
3.0,"I am 5’4” and about 110 lbs. I ordered the green in XS. The jacket is cute and the color was awesome, but the fit was odd. I looked like a Minecraft or roblox character (in other words, like a green box). It wasn’t too big…it just didn’t look right. Sad to return it because it’s cute!"
3.0,"I am 5'6 174lbs. I purchased a L believing that it would be flowy, however it is tight in width. The length is accurate and the neck/sleeves/chest are accurate in size. I did not return because if I went a size up, it would have been way too long and too large in arm/neck area. I was excited about this dress. I love flowy dresses with pockets, however I've never gotten to wear it. Expect a tight fitting dress with pockets. It's awkward."
3.0,The shoulders are capped and VERY baggy which make it look frumpy. I will probably have to have it altered to wear it. A line backer could wear this. Other than that I really like the fabric and quality.
3.0,See true fabric :(
3.0,"I really wanted to give this item a 5 star review since it is absolutely beautiful! Unfortunately the stones fall off easily and I gave these as gifts as we are true crazy cat people, I was super embarrassed when the recipient of the gift told me a stone had fallen off in a matter of days and light wear. Very pretty but the ring could be improved especially for the price atleast adjust the stones better please."
3.0,The product was wayy to big around the mid section. But the length was to short. The shirt looked very off. I would exchange it for a smaller size but the don't offer that. I'm large too girl and this size was still to big on me.
3.0,I liked this hat until I accidentally washed it and it shrunk. Now it is way too small for my head. I am thinking about attaching a zipper to the opening in the now shrunken hat and turning it into a cool pouch. From now on I am sticking to acrylic beanie hats. I have shrunk too many wool hats.
3.0,A nice statement necklace!
3.0,"These socks are very cute but their quality is substandard. Not the most comfortable socks and I'm sure there will be holes in them soon. They look exactly as pictured though, and they cover your feet just fine."
3.0,Typical north face quality. Unfortunately the sizing of this vest is not very good. It runs larger than it did on previous versions of the same vest. See photo. Both are a medium.
3.0,"I really have liked these glasses, but after a week a screw popped out - I can’t find it so I tried to replace it with a screw from an eye glass repair kit. And that screw won’t stay in place. I have one pair at home and one at work. The work pair is fine - I haven’t used them that much. Like the concept but not this pair - I don’t have packaging anymore so I guess returning them won’t work."
3.0,It seams to be smaller than an 18 inch. But overall an okay item.
3.0,Not as effective as advertised
3.0,"The quality is OK for the price. I did however asked if the length would hang on everyone like it does on the model. I was given a terse 30 inch chain measurement. Be warned the girl pictured is small and the pendant hangs below the chest area which is what I wanted. On me and my C cup breasticles it hangs just below the breastices and I used the extension chain all the way to the end. Hmmmmm it does not exactly hang on my 5'6' frame as it does on Miss Teeny there. As far as tarnishing goes, I plan on storing it in the bag it came in."
3.0,I love the lens but the frames are too tiet.
3.0,Produced seemed to be a bit bigger than expected. I would go down a size.
3.0,"Be careful if you're thinking of ordering this - the bracelet I received was somewhat as pictured EXCEPT for two things.  The herkimers, the feature stone since it's in the middle, had a bunch of dark spots in them, really don't look nice at all.  Also, there were fewer labradorite stones and more iolite.  If I had seen this bracelet in advance I'd have never purchased it.  Live and learn I guess."
3.0,two of the stones came off.  I was going to return it but then the seller is now charging for shipping so I just opted to keep it.  I love the design.
3.0,"The quality is good, but I am solid in my size with every other shirt.  This shirt runs a size too small, so get a size larger.  Also neck is smaller than standard for sizes too"
3.0,"love the shape, but the prongs that hold in the stone snag on everything. will have to be replaced because it's a struggle to even wash my face."
3.0,"Beautiful project. Was not the size i ordered. Didn't fit my phone, was too small."
3.0,"Purchased as gift for tween, not as sparkly as other item purchased from this vendor (noticeably so)<br />Dainty necklace either for the young teen/adult or could be layered with other delicate chains."
3.0,As an avid runner averaging 16 miles each weekend I needed headgear in hand gear for the cooler temperatures.They set is more than adequate For the moderate winners in Southern California.
3.0,"These are very narrow. They are a tad more than 7 ½"" wide and only 12"" tall including the sealed bottom (see pics 1 and 2). I believe next time I will buy dog-poop bags, which are closer to the food-storage bag size I need. Also, THE FIRST TWO BAGS out of the box were scraped in some way that put holes in them. I find no issue with flimsy boxes. These were in a nice sturdy box which should last through the use of 200 bags (see pic 3). The dispenser is a diamond-shaped punch-out that seems to be working (pic 4).<br /><br />UPDATE: After the first 4-5 bags, the perfs don't work any more. The bag bottom (sealed seam next to the perfs) gets torn and the bag no longer holds air or moisture. I am having to cut these apart now in order to avoid waste.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE: when I use these to store cheese in the fridge, the cheese dries out. :("
3.0,Love the shoes but too small
3.0,"As I just said, graphics on hat were not up to expectations, smallish and not vibrant enough."
3.0,I would have preferred it be longer in the body and arms.
3.0,"Fit is true to size and material is soft. They're a little thinner than other Time and True leggings I have. I bought these to wear when I go out but because they're thinner than I wanted I'll be returning. They would be ok for just hanging around the house, or as pajamas."
3.0,Snug all over and long. I'm 5'2 and like to wear heels and it's still too long.
3.0,I think I would like this product if I got a smaller size.
3.0,"I love the size, the fabric, find the colors, but the quality of the stitching is not great! I was reselling them in a shop and I had a customer call me who was very disappointed in the fact that right after she washed them to him came out. That is why I will have to give it a three-star."
3.0,Not too shabby for a cheaper boot. Works for limited use. Definitely to be worn with thicker socks. Semi-waterproof.
3.0,"Nice material, love the color but too big. I usually wear M, ordered M and fit is WAY sloppy on me. Back it goes."
3.0,"As others have mentioned, the torso of this suit is just too short. Even with a smaller chest and what I consider an average length torso, the top of the suit was stretched to capacity and too low once I tied it around my neck. Had to return for this reason. Otherwise it’s a nice suit."
3.0,"These are pretty earrings... but very tiny, very tiny"
3.0,"Well I guess you get what you pay for… Unfortunately, one of the straps is already breaking where it is attached to the bag. I have only used it for a total of about six days. I do like the size though and the outside pockets. If it weren't for the strap breaking I would probably give it five stars"
3.0,"It was nice, but not the size in product description in either place on the page. Also, each description gave conflicting measurements!  I ordered it anyway hoping it would be close, but it was too narrow at the top."
3.0,"Very cute but verrrry tiny, even the post and backer are so tiny!"
3.0,It was okay for 1 wearing.  Broke the second time I wore it!  Not happy!
3.0,"My wife wore this as part of a funny Halloween costume where I was hugh and she was a bunny. She of course is plus size, so we chose this piece. It is beautiful and colors are great. However, there is practically no boning and therefore zero support. She a large cheated woman and it didn’t matter how tight we tied this, it just kept slipping down, folding and bunching. It served its purpose for shock value at our party, but only last about an hour before she changed into a t-shirt because it became super annoying for both of us to continuously pull up and tie over and over. May not be an issue for someone with smaller chest. My other complaint is about the feathers at the top. They also lacked support and did not stand up as expected."
3.0,The top is good but the bottoms are very small.
3.0,"I was trying to match this tie with the Biscotti bridesmaids dresses we purchased at David’s Bridal and they were NOT good together. The “taupe” is definitely more like a tan....very yellow undertones. Oh well, it’ll make a nice tie for my husband now. Quality of tie was nice."
3.0,It's really pretty but not spacious at all. I feel like taking out the middle portion would allow you to put more stuff in it. The material is also very hard.
3.0,I do like the watchband. Very cute. My issue is it appears to be tape over a standard watch band. And the tape doesn't stay. I had to glue mine.
3.0,Buttons are falling off. They have not been run through the dryer. Stitching coming out. I bought 3 colors and 2 of the 3 are messing up. I bought the $20 Amazon basics one and they are holding up better than these and for half the price. I am not happy with the quality. Save your money.
3.0,"First off the shirt is soft and looks cute until it is put on. My wife is 5' 11"", and these types of shirts usually fit below her belly button, but this shirt hits her about 4 inches above. She said the material is soft and feels good, but she will not wear it out of the house because of how high it hits her. If you have a shorter torso, the shirt will probably be long enough, but beware if you have a longer torso."
3.0,"It's a quality product, well made, good materials but I found it to be too heavy for my purposes. I don't plan to carry it with me during my trips. I gave it away."
3.0,"Received my item fast but the stone part is smaller then what I would have liked. It""ll be hard to see the blue color."
3.0,"Cute dress but very short, even with tights I was uncomfortable all day."
3.0,"not in love with it, but don't hate it either."
3.0,I expected the material to be thicker and soft but no it’s very thin is seams cheap the color was was nice but the pants are to long I got it for my daughter she is 5”5 and it fit her very long from the pants it was a medium
3.0,It is not soft nor does it provide any coverage. Who cares? It's cheep and durable enough to survive a wild Halloween.
3.0,"Really wanted a g shock , but I used my Apple Watch for everything kinda a combination."
3.0,"Pros: Super Comfy, Good Fit ( I did order 1 size larger than their size chart suggested as recommended by others), They definitely are like a second skin as mentioned earlier meaning they cling to your legs like tights but that was expected after the reviews, They are warm<br /><br />Cons: I can't tell the front from the back ( Silly I know), They are see through folks. Not terrible at first glance but I have a high standard. I went straight to the mirror and bent over and you can see my skin show through plus the underwear very clearly, You can see your legs through them as well especially when sitting because it stretches them a bit. I was suprised by this because of the fleece but the fleece is very light inside of them and looks a little pilly. It's not really like a a full second layer of another fabric. They aren't like tights exactly so they do have better cover but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them without a tunic or dress, or just around the house.<br /><br />I am keeping them because they are comfy and warm. Great for the house and good under clothing or with long shirts, tunics, dresses, etc. They also seem to be the type of fabric that will not fade but time will tell. I will not be purchasing them again because I am looking for the non see through pair."
3.0,"One of the cords rubber holders already broke, hard to believe rubber could break so easy"
3.0,Large variety. Some cute but others were stained. You take your chance for low cost.
3.0,Pretty but with three wearings the black coating is coming off to reveal the metal beneath.
3.0,"I bought this for my girlfriend and it does not fit. If you have very skinny legs and small hips this might fit you but if you have muscular legs you will not enjoy it. The material is great and I can see that if it fit well they would last a long time, the fit is just not ideal."
3.0,It is alot tighter then expected. Hoping it will stretch after a few uses.
3.0,Better suited for skinny girls.
3.0,Don't really like the material... Looks cheap
3.0,"These earrings are great, but huge.  And I love statement earrings, but a 5'-2"" these swallowed my head"
3.0,"I ordered the green and yellow pants. The yellow isn't as bright as the picture. The tag inside the pants says they are cotton spandex, but there is absolutely no stretch and therefore no spandex in the product, so they're mislabeled. They worked well enough for our Halloween costumes though!"
3.0,These appear to be really sticky until I try to put my foot in the shoe.  They come right off.
3.0,"I mean, it’s okay. A little dull and has some rough edges but it’s lightweight and serves its purpose. Kinda looks like something you’d get out of one of those quarter machines."
3.0,"Not too small, I mean it's just too short !"
3.0,My wife says that fit a little small. Or it's actually the band around the waist. She said it made it feel like a rubber glove. If the band was made the same way as the panties it might work. The band is very thick. The rest of the material feels amazing. We dont think they're sexy other than the fact that you can see through them.
3.0,"The photo makes it look like you can see through the colors to get an effect much like stained glass. In actuality, the colored velvet squares and rectangles are opaque. The only way the colors can be seen is to make sure a fairly bright light is shining right on them."
3.0,Fit was good for me but material is very thin not a winter cover. Tried to use as a mask for covid but would not recommend!!
3.0,You get what you pay for...it's ok.
3.0,"I tried it and had to return it. The color was not what I expected. The arms were right, I was afraid that I might bust the stitches so I didn't even try to pull it all the way."
3.0,Pants are super cute but if you have big but and thigh these jeans aren’t for you !!!! There’s no stretch order size up ! Need help with sending these lovely jeans back
3.0,"I really liked this top but the thumb holes are not on correctly so they're more like pinky holes unless I twist the sleeves,  which makes it really tight."
3.0,They are ok for the price. Almost disposable though. Minus two stars because after one wash they unfold held by just one central stitch. I can’t see why that would be by design to unfold the multi layer design advertised. I tuck it all back in once in my head and it’s ok. The size is ok. Of couple of stretches if too right will relieve tightness. They do the job for a workout but I’m disappointed with the unfolding thing after they are washed. I see this same comment on other nylon headbands as well regardless of the price. I think these are all the same mass produced in China anyway regardless of branding and price. Basically a swatch of nylon stitched in the back to crimp it.
3.0,The sweater is soft material with a lot of stretch but definitely much shorter than how it appears in the photo.
3.0,Nice comfy coverup. See through so not appropriate for what I was hoping as a work dress. Funny how the pictures shown with woman wearing them describing them as good dresses are ALL in dim lighting. You can see your braw and my tatoos straight through.
3.0,"It could be made out of better fabric. Faded after first wash because its cotton. But it is a cute hat, co-worker bought six of the same design because she saw it on me."
3.0,Fits somewhat small on my daughter.
3.0,Ordered a large but it fits like a medium. I'm afraid to wash it cause it might not fit anymore.
3.0,"It's &#34;OK.&#34; I bought two of these, a light gray and a blue. The quality is decent for the price, but the texture is itchy and the &#34;slouch&#34; of the hat is very long--much too long. (Almost comical, I think!) Wearing this hat, the slouch touches my back between my shoulders (just below the base of my neck). The weight of the slouchy part of the hat, because it's so long and heavy, tends to pull the hat off. It's awkward and causes me to have to hold my head forward somewhat, making it uncomfortable. The size of the hat would not be too big if you have a mess of long, thick hair you wanted to put inside of it. I bought these because I have a shouchy hat which I love and cannot find again. It's also a very thick hat. I would not be able to wear this any time of year except very cold winter days. I am not returning them, but I would not buy them again."
3.0,"As expected, the earrings are lovely. I'd like them to also sell larger ones."
3.0,Other than the fact that it was to small. It is a very nice kimono.
3.0,Surface fir foot rough and not comfortable
3.0,"Bought a XXL when I would normally buy a L or XL in most clothing. They are pretty darn baggy on me but, expecting them to shrink up a bit in the wash.  Nice lounging outfit for gardening and pulling on over swim suit etc. I'm 5'10 and 190lbs these come down to my ankles when worn on the first button... but super saggy in the a$$. 😜 When I button on the last button the pockets sit up on my lower back. They look cute cuffed.  Maybe not worth the 22 bucks."
3.0,"If you like huge earrings then this is for you but personally, they were way too long"
3.0,Christmas gift for my daughter and she likes them a lot! She said they can however rub the ankles and make them sore. Easily fixed with some fabric!
3.0,"The jacket is really cute, but too small. I ordered it a size up and it was still too small. I ended up giving the jacket away."
3.0,"Overall not too thrilled with this. The color is beautiful. The fit is just right. However, it fits awkwardly. Where the lace stops and the sheer solid portion begins, it meets just above my belly button, so I feel it makes me look like my hips have disappeared. I ordered a XL because the recommended size chart says to go up a size. Traditionally I am a large. I would not recommend this product only because I feel the fit doesn't fully compliment me as I wish it had."
3.0,"The option with the strap going through the handle on the top mentions it has a headphone port in the front to allow your headphones to come through a small hole in the bag. However, the headphone port is completely fake on the bag with no access into the pockets and the spot where it would enter into the inside of the bag is completely inaccessible from the inside so making a hole yourself would not help as you have no access into the designed pockets in the bag. Buyer beware."
3.0,Loved it but was top short and gave me a major wedgie front and back. Returned
3.0,Not high enough on the waist.
3.0,gave to my daughter size 6
