5.0,"good value, nice product"
5.0,Love these socks. So comfortable
5.0,I usually wear large but ordered xlarge for lose.  It was more like a medium
5.0,Good value and product. I'm glad they offer a better price by not including the cases.
5.0,hilarious and comfortable.  Great shirt
5.0,Haven't had a pin fall off my shirt since I installed the backs. Only tricky thing is keeping track of the key to tighten the backs.
5.0,Really nice pewter pendant.  Neck-cord can be sized automatically just by sliding the knots up or down... such a great idea!
5.0,These earrings are so pretty and different. I got several comments when I wore them to church. Love that they can be separated and just the crystal part can be worn.
5.0,These earrings are super cool and trendy.<br />They are shiny and glittery and they look like the real thing.<br />I haven't had any issues with peeling or discoloration so you can buy these with confidence.<br />They are made to last and they look great!
5.0,I asked for this backpack for Christmas and I actually got it.  I wanted it to use when I went to the paintball field with my Planet Eclipse GX Gear bag.  It's not very big but will work for a minimal amount of things.  You can make it bigger by unzipping the bottom of the bag.  There are not a ton of pockets but it is a nice compact bag.  Being that it's winter right now I have actually been using it to carry my shoes and a couple shirts and a pair of shorts when I go run at the gym.  My big GX bag actually filled up really quick so I will use this back pack to hold 2 markers ( in cases) and some barrels.  The zippers all work really well but the very front opening of the bag is a little hard to open and close due to the hard black material.  I am hoping that overtime and more use that it will break in and allow the  zipper to close easier.  I just hope it doesn't break before it breaks in.  I guess only time will tell but so far I love the blue color and print design.  All the Molly webbing is good and will allow you to attach a ton of items with carabiners.  Overall I would recommend it even with the high selling price but then again Planet Eclipse doesn't have anything that is inexpensive.  You will like it other than the hard to open zipper in the front
5.0,"These work great! No fogging, and no leaking. So glad I bought these! Will be buying more for the family!"
5.0,I suggest you order up a size if you have a belly like me and don't want attention on the belly and for better room in the arm I am a lrg dress size or 14/16 normally and I am 5 3 (heels on in this dress and it's still very long)It is definitely a bodycon so it is designed to fit snug like a glove and it still will by ordering a size up (as I did in the pic) I added a belt but I loved the dress and I received lots of compliments! I got this for Valentine's 2021 so I accessorized it with red I will order other prints because I loved the fit!
5.0,I love it.!!
5.0,Super.
5.0,Legging fits as expected and is exactly the product that was advertised. Thank you.
5.0,Baby gift mom loved it
5.0,Love it. Perfect size to carry basic necessities for an event. It's good for its price especially if only used once or a few times.
5.0,Beautiful! Exactly as pictured and great quality. Just what I expect from a Betsey Johnson. LOVE IT!
5.0,Very nicely packaged and beautiful scarf. Nice quality and good price. Highly recommend
5.0,The metal is of very good quality
5.0,"Got these yesterday and immediately tried them on to see what the hype was about. They fit perfectly and were the perfect length which doesn’t happen often with leggings for me (I’m 5”2). These are super slimming but not tight and uncomfortable, they feel really high quality but not too thick to where they’re not breathable, and the secret pocket is way bigger than anticipated. Might buy a second pair!"
5.0,"My nieces loved them to wear in their play kitchen.  The fix was a little big, but they will grow into them."
5.0,Classic. Simple. Durable. Affordable.
5.0,"I love this headband. Rarely comes off my head. It is super stylish, and well made. AND A GREAT PRICE."
5.0,"These earrings look beautiful online so I ordered them in the apple green Jade and the Orange Jade. They arrived quickly and just in time for Mother's Day! I gave the orange one to my mom and she loves them! They are lightweight and on the smaller side so you can wear them for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. They can be dressed up or down and will work with any outfit, big plus in my opinion!! The problem that im having with the green Jade is that while the description does say there will be a hole through the stone (like a bead) that is unnoticeable when wearing, on this pair the hole is on the side where you can see it from the front. While looking closer at the hole in my Jade green stone, I noticed glue. It had strings of a clear adhesive around the edge of the stone and where the metal parts meet, like you'd get with a hot glue gun. This pair definitely didn't look as well made as the other I bought. I haven't decided if I'll keep them or not yet! I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I will Update my review if I have this resolved somehow and need to change my rating.<br />5/15/16: the seller contacted me via email and appologized for the defect on the stone and sent me a new pair that are beautif! The customer service is outstanding and I love my new earrings!"
5.0,"I've been searching for a new no show belt for a few weeks now and finally decided on this one, so glad I did, it's perfect, and does not bulge in the front!  I ordered two more for my other jeans!<br /><br />UPDATE: I now have order 7 or these belts in various colors and just leave them in my jeans/pants until it time to wash!  I love them."
5.0,I got a ton of compliments when I wore it.  I'm a mature woman and I love the length was at my knees (its not too short and wore leggings because I would be going up and down hills all day and it worked great. Shipped fast.
5.0,"Nicer than expected. I bought this for my wife in recognition of her getting her CWP (concealed weapons permit). All in all, nice"
5.0,Fits great great boots
5.0,"B cup over here, so fits perfectly ! Loved wearing this over the summer. Definitely a head turner."
5.0,A tad smaller than Expected
5.0,Dress came as expected! Great quality and the correct color. I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly!
5.0,Ordered up one size. Great fit and so cute!
5.0,"I loved the look of this jersey and in the Southeast, it is HOT!  I still like to ride, even though it is hot out, so as you would expect, I need cool breathable jerseys... This one is awesome and excellent...  I normally wear an XL or 2XL, but on this one I wear a 3XL and it fits me perfectly."
5.0,"This is my second pair of Teva boots. Bought these to replace the De La Vinas I had that looked worn out and were no longer comfortable. These are a little narrower than my De La Vinas, and they slip on, but they are more waterproof. The dark color looks great. I wear them almost every day and they are wearing really nicely. I'm an 8 in regular shoes, 8.5 in boots. Ordered the 8.5 and they fit great. A little tight along the sides at first but never uncomfortable and wore in during my first walk in them. Also, can't beat the Amazon price on these! I got them for about $56 which was such a deal."
5.0,Great product! Highly recommend.
5.0,Te hay are pretty good quality
5.0,very nice and good quality display. Love it

5.0,"This silk set is beautiful and looks perfect with my husband's new suit.  He has received many compliments on this set.  Actually, he was really surprised when he opened this gift.  He could not believe that such a beautiful set was available on-line.  Thank you Amazon for making this set available at a reasonable price."
5.0,Love this hoodie. Fits well and have gotten multiple compliments. The logo is awesome.
5.0,Looked exactly like it was shown in the pictures. I still wear them every so often. Worth the purchase for me🐍
5.0,"I received my order and opened the box to find 4 pieces. 1 necklace, 1 bracelet, 1 pair of earrings and 1 ring. The color is vibrant and looked very nice. I haven't tried it on it but it's beautiful. It is gold plated, so I don't know how long the finish will last but when it arrived, I was in awe of the craftsmanship."
5.0,"Muy bien echa la forma. No muy grande ni muy pequeño, esta muy bonito."
5.0,This is the only gaiter my son will keep on. Comfortable and tolerable
5.0,Looks and fit snug
5.0,Turned into my everyday handbag. Great quality and price!
5.0,My teen daughter LOVES how cute and soft these are!
5.0,"This was gorgeous and well worth the price!! I attended a wedding in Ireland and my cousins spent over 50 euro for their fascinators!! I got a ton of compliments!!  It was comfortable to wear, barely knew it was there!! You will not regret this purchase!<br />P.S.... side note ... when it arrived,  the netting was a bit bent from shipping  but I used a hair dryer to re-shape it and it was fine!!"
5.0,"I love this jacket! The black color is dark and beautiful and the cut and fit are perfect for my curvy figure. This jacket is perfect for all seasons, and can be worn with so many outfits- daytime to nighttime, casual to dressy. The fabric is comfortable and breathable and not scratchy. It doesn't feel or look bulky or bunchy. Washes easily in my garment bag and I hang to dry."
5.0,"Super cute, well made leotard. Fits my kind of small 2.5 year old well with a little space to grow. She wears 2t clothes typically. Would happily buy more!"
5.0,Lov lov lov
5.0,I love that these lanyards have the option for clips or elastic ends for glasses! The quality was also great.
5.0,Much better than the original clip.  Makes the fitbit 1 as cool as the new watch styles and all the different colors are great.
5.0,was a great Christmas gift
5.0,"It's lovely but I don't see how it's been labeled big. It's quite delicate. In fact, I wish the stone beads were larger. I like layering my malas so having something small will be good for the purpose. I got 3 other malas from this vendor and am pleased with the quality."
5.0,No more star light at night.
5.0,I love this coin purse.
5.0,"I've bought probably 8 different kinds of masks since COVID hit.  They were all uncomfortable in some way - too loose, too tight,  too small, made my glasses fog up, etc. etc.  These masks are a perfect fit, do not move around on my face, and the nose wire is strong enough to stay put even when I put my glasses on top of the mask to avoid having them fog up!  Super glad I found them!"
5.0,I really enjoy this band. Very durable and manly<br /> (for lack of a better word).
5.0,"The only thing I can get my toddler to wear. They fit great, they are so soft and wash well. I bought a second pack and will continue to buy these."
5.0,"Pretty, feminine, unique, and well worth the price. Pretty when layered with other bracelets"
5.0,Beautiful dress. Good quality material. My little girl looked like a princess in this dress!
5.0,"Spent $1,200 at the eye doctor for basically the same glasses. I had cataract surgery in both eyes and these glasses work perfectly! I work with numbers all day so my vision is important!"
5.0,This is one of my very favorite beads ever!!!  it goes so perfectly with my sea green/sea blue tropical bracelet!!
5.0,Great quality and price!
5.0,I have really sensitive skin and the silicone bands basically rub my skin off! This is even better if you get it wet all the time it stays put! Drys fast! Still going strong!
5.0,Good looking on!
5.0,"Great price, easy to use.  Soft fabric.  Was helpful to use after rotator cuff surgery or shoulder surgery. Very helpful and convenient."
5.0,This item is absolutely gorgeous!! I love it!! I can’t wait to wear it to my special event!!
5.0,"I am very picky about my underwear, and the Madeline Kelly cotton briefs really surprised me. They fit perfectly and the elastic is not binding but soft, perhaps due to the wider style. I find myself reaching for one of these first when getting ready each day. They have held up well over months of washing and drying, and still look as good as the day I opened the package. Highly recommend!"
5.0,"This jacket fit well, and was comfortable and super light."
5.0,"This dress is really pretty. I love this style and I always opt for this type of dress when I can find it. Although I this dress fits pretty well in the body, and I do not want it to be any tighter, I do feel like the chest area is a little baggier than expected. I have a somewhat large chest and I went by the measurements posted, so I expected it to fit a little better than it did-more curved to my body in the chest area. It seemed a bit baggy in the top which affected the look of the neckline. Even so, I am giving 5 stars because it is very comfortable and the looseness in the neckline does not make a terrible impact on the look of the dress. I am still very happy with it and it can probably be fixed with a push-up =-)<br /><br />The material is stretchy and has a liner in the top part of the dress. It comes down to just below my knees. The zipper pull is small and not very noticeable, but glides easily and did not jam or get stuck. I was able to do it myself and not need assistance to pull the sipper to the top. The bow is pretty cute, but it is sewn on after the fact so if you are thinking you like the dress but not the bow, it appears like it can be easily removed by cutting the thread holding it on. That does not mean it is likely to fall off though- it is very secure when I messed with it, but looks like it can be easily removed if the wearer wants it to be (and knows what I mean about cutting the thread for the bow, and NOT cutting the thread for the dress!).<br /><br />I am still really happy with this dress. You can see in the pictures what I mean about the chest, but I still think it looks good.<br /><br />I received this dress at a discount in exchange for my honest review of it."
5.0,Shipped super fast! The product is as shown. Very well packed. Really great for the price and the different styles are lovely!
5.0,These earring are very pretty. I can't wait to give them to my daughter in law for her birthday.
5.0,"Lenses are CLEAR, so do not expect anything but a decorative lens<br />But the overall quality is fantastic for the price"
5.0,"Nothing cheap-o about this cap. A quality item. 6 panel crown, embroidered front and back. Perfect size adjuster band--NOT plastic or Velcro.(Actual cloth and brass clasp system).&#34; Irish Green&#34; trim, nice Golden Harp on green shield patch. Really a great looking cap."
5.0,"Lovely! I'm 5'10 and like dresses like this to hit just about the knee and this one delivered. Not only was it very flattering, but the length was perfect for an event. I washed the dress in the washing machine and it came out looking brand new. Very pleased."
5.0,Great coupons.
5.0,Came exactly how it is shown on site perfect
5.0,"Okay so I normally don't wear pants like these because I don't think I would like them for my body type. However, these were very comfortable. I do however recommend to size up if you've got some chubbyness like me. I got an XXL, and they fix about how a L or XL would fit. I also wear the shorts in the same size. The fabric is nice, and the waistband doesn't roll down. (Perfect for sitting for a long time if needed to. I would order again."
5.0,comodas
5.0,I usually wear like a Large but I went up to a 3 xl. I have a 32 waist
5.0,Awesome dress. Fits beautifully.  Is a bit thin so will need a slip and cami underneath. I ordered a xxl so I'd have the flowy affect.  I'm 5'10&#34; 200 lbs.  comes with a belt made out of the dress material which is nice. Really excited to wear it to the bridal shower ..
5.0,"Great skirt, wife loves it. Fits great, quality is great and looks really good on her. Fits her just like it fits the model in the picture. Would buy again!! Thanks!"
5.0,Super durable and great for everyday wear!
5.0,These are amazing-little snug but medium was too big so I will stick to small-love these! will be ordering more for a few more fingers- can grip my hair and curlign iron easily (n slippage or burn)
5.0,Hilarious and comfy!
5.0,"Maybe the most uncomfortable running shoes ever. I have ran in mizuinos my whole life, and these were a game changer."
5.0,It’s a perfect... my height and weight match the size perfectly
5.0,Nice quality he loved the quick release buckle
5.0,"Excellent and solid case. Easy to hold, fits phone perfectly."
5.0,I initially wanted to return them because they are similar to another pair but these are cooler
5.0,perfect jersey
5.0,I love this piece. It is heavy (in the best sense of the word) and sturdy and I have no fear of losing it because of a cheap clip. It hooks securely to my purse loop and makes the pouch I hooked to it easy to reach to swipe my Metro card. I highly recommend it.
5.0,I love how cool it feels and very light fabric. Definitely a must wear during hot seasons.
5.0,great service and product.
5.0,Was beautiful
5.0,The colour of the product is superb. The material is also very comfortable. Overall a very good product.
5.0,Good deal and look great on white shirt<br />I got them for my groom mens<br />Like them!!!!
5.0,"Super cute! Got mine in the blue color and I absolutely love it! You can either dress it up or wear it casual. It's not super thin, so you can get away with just a bra underneath. I got a size up and ordered and XXL since I have a big bust. It's not super big on me, it fits just right. I recommend ordering a size up whether or not you have a big bust. Definitely love this shirt and I'll get a lot of use out of it."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous authentic costume!
5.0,Came in really late but overall it is absolutely beautiful.
5.0,We live maps - and this is so intricate and beautiful and the chain is pretty as well - just as shown in your ads!
5.0,"Great hat! Adjustable, great fit!"
5.0,FUN STUFF. VERY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT
5.0,"I love this sweater.  Nice quality, and the colors are nice too.  The bit of spandex makes it very comfortable, and yet looks  somewhat fitted.  It is hard to find a cardigan sweater with roomy pockets, and this is just right.  I bought 4 of them!"
5.0,Very fine detail and quality.
5.0,It is perfect!
5.0,It has pockets so it's already a win for me. I like it for &#34;bloated days&#34; but I expected it to be a bit slimmer in the waist. It's comfortable and cute.
5.0,This jewelry was packaged<br />properly and it is has advertised in the pictures. Two anklets arrived!!
5.0,Good quality and washes well. What more can you ask of a sock?
5.0,"So beautiful,  perfect for me! I'very always loved the Tree of Life motif, the Triquetra details make it just that much more special. Fits well on my Charmed Memories bracelet."
5.0,"I am 5'6"" and 185 lbs -- got a medium.  I usually wear an xl... I probably could have gotten a small but it's comfy and I love it. Buying more"
5.0,"Heard it runs small, but it was good news for me since I always have this issue of things usually fitting me too big on my head. Fits great, I'm putting in a hook and eye clasp on the back to have it close better and cutting some near the eye and around the nose to flatter better but I'm mega excited to wear it with my Catwoman costume this year."
5.0,These came out beautiful. Thanks so much
5.0,This is a x-mas gift but from looking at them they are very well made. I am sure they are going to<br />be perfect.
5.0,"Gorgeous dress! I bought this dress for my daughter’s birthday. Got many compliments!!!<br />True size, perfect for the little princess to show off!! I will definitely recommend. The only thing is I feel it’s overpriced."
5.0,Love this dress - i want it in every color. It is very comfortable and relaxing. Can dress up or down. I received lots of compliments when I wore it.
5.0,"It's really nice, although the actual colour is slightly different then the photo. It's more of a blood red rather then a bright red. That's wasn't a problem for me though."
5.0,This shirt got here way faster than I anticipated and it will be perfect for my husband! I can't wait to see his face when he opens this Christmas morning!
5.0,"1.  Very Durable and Reliable<br />2.  They will last  10 Years... except the strap. ( $3 bucks)<br />2.  Battery last 5 years.  Then it is probably best to buy a new watch.  Price of battery +  Strap is as much as the watch.<br />3.  VERY INEXPENSIVE $ 15<br />4.  The most lightweight watch out their.  Very water resistant.  I shower, bath, swim with it on.<br /><br />5. Casio make at least 10 models of this watch.<br />  I prefer the one with the backlight,<br />  But bought this one for the gold like looks and a little more variety.<br /><br />6. I've got about 4 of these... the bands go and I just buy a new one, since it is easier.<br /><br />7. Casio has been making this watch for probably 30 years.<br /><br />I have other nice dress watches, but you  have to wind them or replace the batteries yearly.<br /><br />You can't go wrong on this watch.  For the cost of 3 Starbucks you've to a go to watch for any sport .  I also have a Polar."
5.0,"This is a great charm! (just fyi, someone is making a knock-off of this that I have seen; I recommend buying this real one for the quality of the details, for anyone who is looking for a souvenir of St. Basil's).  Thank you!"
5.0,Great length.
5.0,Love the color. It's a tad lighter than in the picture but still a nice lavender color. I gave it to my friend as a gift coz she likes purple & she was so happy! She uses it at work & they're asking where she got it coz they want one too. Nice plastic - durable & a good size with a bonus zipper on top.
5.0,I'm 5'3&#34; and 125 pounds. I'm in that in between size of small and medium. Bought these in a small based on other reviews and they fit perfectly. They come to about mid calf and fits right above the hip. I thought they would be too small when I first opened the package but they have a nice stretch without being see through. I would purchase these again in other colors.
5.0,Honestly i dont usually like to buy leggings online because i am afraid of bad quality. You can tell that these are very well made with lasting material that wont show my undies!
5.0,So cute and very comfortable
5.0,"Love! Came way earlier then expected, looks and fits perfect! Also matches my green pants perfectly."
5.0,Stunning! A must have!
5.0,Comfortable !! Perfect fit
5.0,So soft! So cozy! LOVE!!!
5.0,"Super cute, flows, fits great, good quality"
5.0,"very sparkly, glad i ordered them"
5.0,"I can't say enough good things about this backpack, it essentially solved a lot of issues with organization when it came to gym gear and university books. The pack's many compartments allow me to carry a full change of clothes (everything from socks, t-shirt, pants, underwear, etc), a shower towel, a face towel, my non-workout shoes, my water bottle, an extra bottle with my protein powder, a note book - plus a couple of thick class books, my usual leisurely reading material (a hardback novel usually), and toiletries (comb, shampoo, soap, etc), my cell phone, wallet, mp3 player, and locker combination lock. And this all fits fine, I don't have to cram it in - nor is it over stuffed at the end of it. Carrying everything in this one bag is super convenient, and frankly very comfortable. The designers of the bag made it pretty ergonomic. Overall it's a great product, well worth the price. I got the gold one because I like a little colour on my backpack, all black is too boring."
5.0,"In love with these earrings, very trendy. I bought these solely based on the reviews and I have to agree these are a great deal for the price!  Can dress up any casual outfit or add to any a dressier wardrobe."
5.0,"I loved this dress, and so did my friends when I sent them pictures! Totally recommend!"
5.0,Works Great!!
5.0,"Cute bunny, but the obsidian is much darker than pictured (almost black instead of brown). I got two, and they were both very dark. They do have a special sheen though. The necklace is beautifully made. I loved it."

5.0,"Fits perfect! I ordered a small and I’m 130lb 5 1 and a 35 D. Stretchy and soft! Perfect length! Church worthy, if that’s your thing!"
5.0,I LOVE these pants. You need to follow the size chart the company provides and the fit will be as expected. I am 5&#34;10 and a size 16 the XXXXL fits me perfect The material is not see through. It hangs nicely on the body and is so soft.
5.0,these ear muffs are great. they worked well at the shooting range.
5.0,Very soft! Great buy!

5.0,"Ran a little snug in the boobs, but otherwise fit according to size.  VERY CUTE!!!  love it!"
5.0,Very comfortable but large for me. 6 2 190. Should have ordered a large.
5.0,"I ordered a small, in pants I wear a 00 or 0. I could’ve ordered an xs and they would’ve fit fine. But, I ordered up because some of the reviews. They fit great. Hang off my hips the way I like. I don’t like clingy sweat pants.  And are so comfortable!! I had high hopes but honestly didn’t expect much. They’re warm and soft. Though, these aren’t made thick enough to wear outside in the dead ass of winter. I love them. I ordered 2 more pair, at the price it’s really worth it."
5.0,Very well made and it looked great!  Everyone at the party loved it.
5.0,a little hard to get fastened but once on they are fabulous!! I have in my cartilage piercing.

5.0,I am 5'-10&#34; and 145lbs. The size small fit perfectly. The legs were not too short (half way up my calf) or too tight. The fabric is of good qualify too.
5.0,Very comfortable fit to size
5.0,I love these earrings!! They are a perfect size and weight
5.0,Comfortable and long lasting
5.0,Has a nice adjustable fit for all head shapes. My glasses never fall off during basketball anymore! Like them so much I'm buying another one
5.0,"The installation was simple, feels very secure & stable.  True leather feel and break in time to form around the wrist.  The tan band it a true caramel color and the rose gold matches back to the face well.  Our package included a few extra connectors for pins.  I have nothing bad to say about any portion of this set.  Very pleased - buy it now"
5.0,"Just what I was looking for. Very soft fabric and great length for wearing with leggings. Fabric is delicate, but I think it is good quality for what it is, and it is thin enough to wear under other tops without being bulky. The straps are not adjustable however. I got the natural color and it is a little darker than it appears in the picture."
5.0,"Got this as a gift for my wife, she is a big HP fan and she loved it. She says that people complimented her on several occasions and she has to tell them it’s not an expensive piece."
5.0,"This is a superb quality product for a an extremely reasonable price. It feels good, fits around the wrist well and I like the push button release clasp. Like others have said, it can be a bit of a challenge to get the spring bars to fit even with the included spring bar tool but if you take your time and be patient it will eventually click into place. I used the spare bars that came with the band... they are slightly thinner than the originals on the watch and have some flex in them to get the bars in place and the band nice and snug up against the watch.<br /><br />Having said all that... if you are not used to using tools and small parts then I would suggest that you be prepared to take it to a jeweller or watch repair place for them to fit but given that the initial cost of the band is so reasonable that would not add greatly to what is a very nice enhancement to an excellent watch / band combo.<br /><br />I am a regular volunteer fireman / stoker on a heritage steam railway and the watch and band feel very secure and it means that at the end of a long, hot day I can just wash the watch and band in hand cleaner, rinse and hang up to dry."
5.0,A little more expensive than most but worth it. Quality material. Super comfy
5.0,I was shocked that this was a super comfy cute dress.  I wanted something different for a wedding that I needed to attend with my boyfriend.  It turned out better than I hoped.  Who knew.
5.0,"Everything about the watchband is perfect!  I love it!  However, I’m not at all happy with the price!  The silver color does not match my Fitbit watch, and still cost $50.  The black watchband that DOES match the watch sells for $80.  Really?  For a watchband?<br />After the disgusting shock of paying that much, I love the watchband!"
5.0,this scarf is beautiful and good quality. I use it to cover my hair when sleeping.
5.0,"So far, I've went swimming at the beach, twice, while wearing the watch. Still functions properly. I'm confident that it'll survive showers and other normal water activity."
5.0,"I really liked the plastic-lined section for wet items and the zippered part for shoes. Its great for occasional use and short overnight trips. The color (grey) is nice. I would like the logo on the front to be smaller. I think it could be bigger if you were to use it as a gym bag, but I pack extra clothes and I carry bathroom items like shampoo ect. to my gym."
5.0,This is a beautiful necklace that I bought to go with a red dress I was wearing on a cruise. It looked great and I received many compliments. It's a little heavy but not uncomfortable. It matches more then that dress because of all of the colors in it. I really like this necklace.
5.0,The ring was just perfect..
5.0,"I was unsure whether to buy small or medium, I wear a size 8 pants. After reading the reviews I ordered a medium and I am glad I did. They fit but would have liked them just a little fuller/looser.  When something is described as harem pants I thought they would be really loose, these aren't. If you want them loose, buy a size up."
5.0,This is an amazing product that your child can wear even after the event for dress up purposes. The sizing seems accurate and I had no issues with it. The material is also durable
5.0,These slippers are very comfortable and fit is as expected. Nice quality. Good value for the price.
5.0,Está muy cómoda
5.0,This was exactly what it pictures and size was spot on.
5.0,This item was bought as a gift for someone and they loved it.
5.0,Enjoy
5.0,"These are cute pajamas and made well unlike some other reviews, I am 5’8.5” and 174#, normally wear a size 12 bottom and 8ish top. The large fit perfect, I haven’t dried them yet but overall I like these pjs. The top is a crop top."
5.0,Pleasantly surprised they are actually cuter in real life. Great price
5.0,Comfortable fit.  Right amount of padding. Seems to be holding up well after numerous rides and washings. Looks good too
5.0,Great for playing in the pool and sun protection
5.0,keeps sand and rocks out but light weight and comfortable. No blisters or rubbing from the start.
5.0,"So glad I found this brand! It's intended as oversized - like the photo - and falls lower in the back with subtle pleating in the front. A tip: It came out of the package very wrinkly but I was afraid to iron/steam out the pleats...I ended up tossing it I the dryer with a wet washcloth and it fell right into place. I was so impressed, I bought another dress from this brand almost instantly!"
5.0,"Love this top, fits great!  I get compliments every time I wear it. Love the feel of the material.  Would love to get more but unable to find them now."
5.0,Pretty and well made
5.0,nice laces
5.0,I looked way cute for Christmas
5.0,Great.  Had a pair and lost one.  Replacement pair.
5.0,"Elvis loves you.<br /><br />These fit well for someone who has a bigger head. Like myself, if you tend to get smaller glasses, don't get these or you may look like a small child."
5.0,"The quote is what my daughter and I saw to each other, so when I saw this on a key chain, I knew it was the perfect little gift!"
5.0,"Great fit, very comfy and soft, cute and simple. I hope to order more in other colors."
5.0,This is a really pretty necklace. It would be perfect for a statement piece. It also has a jingle to it that is really nice to listen to. The silver finish is bright and the blue stone is a lovely focal point.<br />I received a discount for my honest review.
5.0,Very stylish and looks good on my hubby.
5.0,"I purchased these boots for myself and I'm a mother of two grown men. I wear a size 4 1/2 boys and these are perrffeccttt!  Roughish, stylish, warmish and comfortable! 👌"
5.0,My legs don't hurt at work anymore and my feet don't swell! I only wear compression socks to work now.
5.0,This is a great costume!!  I was really impressed since there was no size indicator and I'm a size 14.  It fits!!  Tights and the tutu!!  Love it!!
5.0,Must haves at this price!
5.0,My husband wore it for a party. Fancy but still masculine enough for him to feel comfortable.
5.0,"Nice coat but again runs small gave as a gift, but the seller did give a option to buy another at a  discount price! Win win"
5.0,"Love this shoehorn, it is a fun conversation piece right at my doorstep. Most of it is plastic though, not sure how long it will survive for."
5.0,ADORABLE
5.0,Looovbeveeeee it
5.0,Small and cute.
5.0,"Skirt has a great, flattering fit and perfect for any occasion."
5.0,I'm loving it and adding to my collection
5.0,Stones are Aug-May-Feb-Oct. size 8. Beautiful realistic stone color. Sturdy ring. Ecstatic with purchase.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. I went to my local piercing shop and they were asking for 120 dollars for the same ring. I have not experienced any problems with it.
5.0,I love the colors and the way it wears
5.0,Split the order between our 2 daughters (13 and 8 yrs old) before our Disneyland trip.  They had no problem trading them and even kept a couple that they really liked.  Some pins were very rare and got many compliments.  We purchased pin locks for several of them so they would not get lost.  I would order them again and again.  Great way to get into trading for much cheaper!
5.0,So cute! Seem to be well made.
5.0,"I love this dress! It is a fantastic style, comfortable, and the pattern is so cute. I wear it with above-the-knee suede boots and a Bowler hat:) I do wish the fabric was less polyester and more cotton; however, I can live with it."
5.0,Wear it on left pointer finger. Classic look.  Love it. Ordered 3.
5.0,They're bandannas.  Nice sized
5.0,Would recommend. Have been wearing these shoes for awhile and very comfortable and durable. I will buy again.
5.0,Nice mask - well made
5.0,"I’m pleased with my selection...nice color, good fit."
5.0,"The only thing I can say is had I known this sandal was so comfy, I would have ordered two pair."
5.0,I got a large in this dress and I am usually a medium or a large. It fits great and it is really cute!
5.0,I love my purchase
5.0,These were the first gloves warm and waterproof enough to keep my boys outside playing comfortably.  They fit so well.
5.0,"Received my Unisex Polarized Sports Sunglasses and I am definitely satisfied.  No use in overpaying for expensive name brand sunglasses when these do the trick.  They're comfortable, stylish, and light on my face.  The interchangeable lenses, hard cover and soft nylon cases are a bonus as well!"
5.0,I love this bathing suit! Very flattering to waist line and gives me shape but covers my trouble areas which is even better.  I'm 5'5&quot;  250lbs  normally were size 16 jeans.  I ordered a 16 and it fits perfectly. Material is good quality and I love the pattern. I usually dread shopping for swim suits but I'm looking forward to wearing this one on my cruise in few weeks.
5.0,Great great tie for the $ looks great on as well!
5.0,I got so many compliments on this dress. I normally do not like to purchase online clothing but I was more than pleased with this dress for the price and the occasion I needed it for.
5.0,Love the fit and feel.  I wore them to Hot Yoga last week and they are now my favorite pants! Like the high waist and the design i got is so awesome (sort of like snake skin).  Wore them all day and was comfortable! They also are very slimming.
5.0,My son loves them<br />Fit perfect
5.0,I loved this dress! The only thing is that it was by random ao I didn’t know what I was getting I wished I would have gotten a less noisy pattern
5.0,"Really nice, soft inside and out. Definitely order a size smaller, as most here recommend. I'm a standard size large (6'0, 170lbs, 16-34/35 dress shirt). The medium fits me perfectly, fits like a standard large size does. Very reasonable price, and no logo (just the V stitching at the neck, which is nice)."
5.0,Perfect fit and fabrics is very soft.
5.0,I love this set it went great with my suit I was the hit of the party!
5.0,These are the best leggings that ever ordered. They are so soft and comfortable. I want to buy all the colors.
5.0,Ordered as a birthday gift for my granddaughter and she really likes it.
5.0,"I bought this dress based off of the positive reviews, and so glad I did! the dress arrived very fast and was neatly folded. The bottom has a lot of volume, so perfect for a dance or formal occasion.  definitely worth 20$ . Fits my 2.5 year old perfectly."
5.0,Above expectation
5.0,"Very pretty and fits well, however it is a little more on the snug side."
5.0,"Product fit true to size, is not cheap material and is very flattering"
5.0,I've bought a shirt from this seller before and I was happy with it so got another one. This is a very nice shirt. The colors are so pretty too. It is made of a soft material so it is super comfy. I like that it is a longer shirt so I can wear it with my leggings.<br /><br />For size reference: I usually wear a medium in most tops so that's what I ordered. I am 5'4&#34; and about 145lbs.
5.0,Ordered a size 4 in stone.  I'm 26/27 waist and 5'4.  Skirt fit perfectly and looks great for casual.  Nice alternative to shorts.
5.0,Can’t wait to use.
5.0,I LUV this hoodie it fits just as I expected. It looks Great. Have gotten lots of compliments.
5.0,Muy bella tela y queda muy bien
5.0,It fits good.
5.0,I need to order more. Worn for a few weeks now and haven't had any slip down my foot.
5.0,"Read here for measuring information for Atlas Nitrile Elbow Length Gloves——<br />Ordered size medium for the Atlas Nitrile  Elbow Length Chemical Resistent Gloves and measured length of hand size from middle/longest finger tip to first bend in wrist and it measured 7 inches (a little less to be exact). The instructions tell you that 8-9 inches is a medium and I found it did fit me perfectly (at 7 inches length). If my hands were any longer, however, I would order a size large and I believe many reviewers are saying it tends to run small as well.  For this item to be returned in its original condition, there is a 20% restocking fee, and if you want to exchange the item or size, there is a handling fee of $10.00 and the merchandise difference. I ordered from Just for Fishing so I am not sure if this is true for all shipping options, but you might want to check before ordering, as I was not aware of this policy when I placed the order and it was fortunate that they just fit. See photo for chemical glove selection chart."
5.0,Love this dress. The bust size is a bit off but nothing a tank top can't correct.
5.0,Super cute.  My daughter loves it
5.0,This necklace is a good quality and is much cheaper than similar items at other online stores. Very pleased.
5.0,"I AM CLAPPING MY HANDS IN MY HEAD AS I TYPE THIS.<br />I'm hyped over how awesome this wig is. I'm stoked to be the first to review it.<br />I love it, plain and simple. The color is on point to the advertised photo. It's fits my head well. The ponytails are big and curly and bouncy and sooooo cute. There are a few thin spots on the top of the wig but they're easily remedied with some adjusting.<br />Excellent quality for the price.<br />I'm freaking impressed. 💕"
5.0,School mascot is the flash. Absolutely perfect!
5.0,I am still getting the hang of putting them on.  I am wearing them only every other day.
5.0,"Good transaction, earring were just as promised, received on time and easy transaction.  Purcahsed for my grand-daughter who is fussy and she loved them.  Thanks!"
5.0,My son loves these pajamas.  Very comfortable and stylish for a 10 year old.
5.0,"I just received this bag. I like the simplicity the design. It smells a bit at first but the scent has slowly dissipated. Good addition to the bag is a small packet of lavender. The straps are a rather slim, which is expected from the pictures. I hope it would hold up for a long time. I have tried changing the use of straps from shoulder bag to messenger bag style, and I am a bit worried that if done frequently it will ruin the straps. I think this is just my concern. It is a perfect size for going out. I gave it 4 stars as I have not use it yet. Also, it would have been even better if the pouch in the bag is of a different lighter color for easy visibility of stuff. I have bought the black one and so any thing black would not be easily visible.<br /><br />update:<br />After I posted this review, I immediately got a response from customer service stating regarding to contact them if I ever have trouble with straps and took note of my suggestion. I think that speaks volume of a company that takes their customers' needs in consideration.<br />I have now use this bag for a whole day, I really like how it stays on my shoulder, and if I need to take some stuff from the bag, that I can easily reach it without having to dig deeper a.k.a mary poppins style. I am used to bigger bags (and thus carry unnecessary weight) but with this bag I am able to bring the bare necessities without suffering from the weight. The bag is very lightweight. It's easy to find my keys and ip balms now! I have enjoyed this bag and this will be my go to daily bag now. Thanks S Zone"
5.0,This is a beautiful bracelet and I can't wait to give it to my friend for Christmas.  She will most likely love it.
5.0,"I am thrilled with the quality and fit of this dirndl blouse! I needed a new blouse for the dirndl I purchased in Munich, Germany and I'm so happy that this is an authentic, high quality blouse, and not a cheap imitation. I would highly recommend this for anyone who needs a high quality piece to go with an expensive dirndl. I will order more pieces from this<br />store!"
5.0,"This is a cute little change purse to hold all those annoying coins you get when you get change when shopping. I learned to keep change in the car area for when I would get change when out and about and money was short. I was always glad when found enough change to grab myself a coffee at Dunkin Donuts. It would be good to keep change or even medication in so you can take it on the run for errands and appointments and picking up the kids, etc...I attached mine to the ring that holds my house keys and it makes it easier to find quickly. There are a few different colors. I chose the Lavendar color which is my personal preference in colors. It is soft to the feel and it is a definitely a positive addition to your purse with it's nice size. I found that this serves my needs and is not only beautiful, but serves the functions I need it for. I love the soft leather and the color has been perfect for me."
5.0,I’ve only had this wallet for a few months and it’s already better than the one it replaced. I accidentally washed it the first week I got it and it didn’t break or frey! Definately a good wallet for the price!
5.0,"Much has been said/revealed about the authenticity of the Power Balance bands. Take it for what it is....a casual arm piece. You can now get these very cheap and are a cool addition for everyday wear. Call it a placebo, if you think it works then it does. And that is what matters the most."
5.0,Bought it for my wife. She loves wearing it on a regular basis. And the fabric seems to be of a good quality.
5.0,"I love this bra. So much that I have bought two now. I got the pink/purple Camo and the grey/black Camo. It’s comfortable and gives enough support without an additional bra. The fact it’s a crop top means it works well enough to wear without an additional top and looks great with high waisted bottoms. I got the XXL and I typically wear a 42DD/E bra, 45” inches around the fullest part of my chest, 38” under my bust. I’m not the best at measuring for bras, it’s always confused me.  My complete measurements are 45/36/41"
5.0,"love love love this shirt. buying them in every color.  fits great. ventilates great. even when I sweat in them, I don't feel gross.  Great for cardio and weight training."
5.0,For the price tag you can't get much better!! Material was study enough not to see through. I love this dress
5.0,"Love the color choices and patterns, it's very comfortable much more so than the silicone band my watch came with. Great stretch, drys fairly quickly, and very easy to change out. Love it!"
5.0,"Loved the cut of this dress and softness of the cotton. I bought the XXL, I'm 5'4, 225 lbs. It fit perfect. I think the XL would have been too snug. The dress fits at knees or a little below. I would definitely buy again."
5.0,I absolutely love this band. It is so lightweight and doesn’t even feel like you’re wearing your watch. Also super easy to get on! I would consider measuring if you have very small wrists and a larger faced Apple Watch.
5.0,Perfect fit for my daughter. No complaints!
5.0,I recently got these for my wife as part of a set she wanted to wear for special occasions. They're absolutely beautiful and feminine. She's already asking for a second pair for her other set of ear piercings.
5.0,Great fit and style for spring and summer office dress. I have to wear business casual Monday - Thursday and these pants will be cool in the warm weather yet are not see through at all. Highly recommend them at such a great price! I am definitely getting more!
5.0,"Soft, stylish and a great fit."
5.0,"arrived in one day, nice!<br />pretty comfortable as it is quite elastic, especially i like sleeves up and tight.  the color is accurate as description.  the button and finishing are done with quality too.  i recommend it."
5.0,"Excellent quality patch, bold bright colors.  Very nice and good price."
5.0,"I am very happy with my purchase of this wrap front sweater.  I love the gray color, which is just as it appeared on my screen, and I like that the band around the bottom and the wrists are soft and stretchy, kind of like a sweatshirt.  The fit was perfect, and that I am very pleased with as I was afraid it may be too small according to the size chart.  I am generally a size 18-20 and it fit right on.  The V neck is not as plunging on me as on the model, and that's a good thing. This sweater is very comfortable, and appears to be well made."
5.0,Jaws Fan enough said!
5.0,LOVE THESE!!!! A TRUE HIDDEN GEM!!!<br />all 24 of these came in a cute drawstring bag and all have cushions on the back. there is no pain or rashes and they are very lightweight and easily adjustable. if you want cute clip on for ur money these are the best!!!! get these now!!!!

5.0,Received a lot of compliments. Fit perfectly.
5.0,"absolutely love these. I can wear them to fit a ponytail or sown. I sleep with the one that has a zebra design to keep my hair from getting knotted. I can wear a bike helmet with it and my hair doesn't get pulled by the helmet. also, because of the different colors I can match my outfit. Love them."
5.0,"Fits perfect, looks good and gives my ‘64 Dan Henry chrono a retro feel."

5.0,I love love LOVE this robe! My boyfriend and I fight over it. So soft and cuddly! I can’t believe something so luxury was so affordable! I can’t wait until mine gets here!
5.0,Bought these for my mom for Christmas and she loved it
5.0,"This is my 4th Chisel bracelet purchase and hopefully my last as I now have bought 8 bracelets in the last year lol. As far as looks the piece is stunning. Brushed and Polished as the picture. I was a little disappointed that it was 10 mm wide and not around 12 mm but I knew that before I purchased. It turns out the 10 mm is perfect because the thickness of the bangle from your arm up is thicker than most bangles. It's got a really cool design that you can kind of see in the picture and is about 3-4 mm.<br /><br />As for fits, ,my wrist is about 7.3 in and it fits me perfect. It's pretty bendable and can be sized to your wrist. The bangle could easily be fitted up to 8 in and can be sized down as low as 7 in. It's also got a perfect oval shape for your wrist.<br /><br />Overall couldn't be happier with this piece."
5.0,Just what we needed for a Dr. Seuss themed baby shower! Sturdy and worked great!
5.0,Perfect size! Bling too!!
5.0,"Very nice fabric, was a too small but I am in the process of weight loss and I am able to button it up now, Yea!"
5.0,Fit nicely and it is a cute sexy little dress!  At first I was a bit confused on the top strap-  after looking at the picture -  it all makes sense .<br /><br />I’m 34A so it’s nothing difficult to cover but I really liked the style and flow of the dress.<br /><br />I liked how it’s open back so my tan is not as weird
5.0,My husband wears these all the time
5.0,Very nice. Daughters really Liked them

5.0,"Love the dress, will be wearing it on my cruise"
5.0,"Such a pretty little necklace. I bought it for the Summer and to wear with my other Mother of Pearl jewelry. Some other reviewers said that the clasp was too small. It's small, but not too small to join together. I love the dainty chain, it looks liquid if that makes sense. The pendant is a nice size not too big not too small. Nice shape, pretty."
5.0,Goes great with the genuine Greek leather cord necklace.  You just have to attach a larger ring to the heart pendant to properly use it on the cord necklace.
5.0,Seems like fine--no surprises.  Large and easy to manipulate.  Will need a good stand.
5.0,These attachments are for mole stripes the go on a Military Type pack. They are ideal for this and have a million uses. I like them a lot
5.0,"Comfortable, sits mid waist (like it's not high-waisted and it doesn't fall down!) It's not too long, and it's flattering in the back!"

5.0,Me encantó se ve muy lindo y de buena calidad
5.0,"I love this comfortable jumpsuit! It fits me perfectly I had a little extra length on the bottom which is great for wearing high heels. But if not it wasn't to long. You can adjust it at the waistband if needed to pull up the pants section of this jumpsuit. It's extremely soft no binding no tightening anywhere in this jumpsuit. It has an elastic waist band to hold it securely in your mind section allowing the legs of the jumpsuit to flow elegantly. It's sleeveless which makes it wearable in Fall, Spring and Summer months add a little jacket, shaw or even a long sleeved shirt underneath and now it's also a Winter time outfit. You can wear it all year around. I'm very impressed with the comfort of this jumpsuit it's super soft. It's size chart is right on the money too! I hav'nt had any issues with wrinkles which is always a plus for me. It comes in several different colors you can chose from."
5.0,"Its a gift for a daughter, I know she will love it !"

5.0,"I bought two sets as a gift for two sisters at he beginning of summer.  They wore them all season, mixing and matching, and had them on the first day of school."
5.0,I brought this for my best friend for a Christmas Gift and I think its gorgeous. Very affordable. Quick and easy gift preparations!
5.0,I use these for working on Bombardier watercraft so I don't get the fiberglass in my arms and they work great with the cooling effect when you sweat.
5.0,My 5 year old daughter reports that these goggles fit her perfectly and she loves them. I will add that the quality appears to be top notch.
5.0,"The pendant is solid metal and quite heavy.  Feels like a quality item, and looks good as well."
5.0,"AIMPACT Running Shorts are the best running shorts. Period. Featuring innovative design, quality materials and excellent workmanship, every running man should wear AIMPACT Running Shorts.<br /><br />The photos are intended to showcase what makes AIMPACT Running Shorts unique. The first photo shows the ergonomic design, double stitched waist, breathable inside lining, tapering for full range of motion and AIMPACT branding. The second photo shows the inside of the shorts where the inside is designed to support where it’s needed most. Excellent!<br /><br />I highly recommend AIMPACT Running Shorts to everyone."
5.0,Liked it!<br />Pouch for filter inside mask. Which it came with one.
5.0,Perfect for those rainy weekends where you can’t do anything else but binge watch shows… LOL! This are extremely comfortable
5.0,Exactly as advertised. The sizing chart was spot on and the images match what I recieved. Really happy with the quality and the service. I'm very active and forget it's on when exercising. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Really cute jumper; I ordered a L and it fit slightly loose, just the way I wanted it. I'd definitely recommend!"
5.0,"I was a little hesitant to buy this after reading the reviews because I wondered if it would be too small. I'm 5'6 and weigh 160 lbs, and usually wear an extra large size shirt (I like things a little loose). I got the XL in this and it fits perfectly. Wore it to a luncheon today and got tons of compliments and &#34;where did you get that?!&#34; inquiries. It's really cute, and forgiving if you're carrying a little bit of extra baggage around your midsection. Glad I went ahead and got it."
5.0,My field hockey playing daughter loves the bracelet. It looks just like it did on line. I am extremely happy with the purchase.
5.0,I've worn it once to work out. It fit well overall but definitely accentuated the cleavage. This would make an excellent everyday bra because of that.
5.0,I bought this Cpt. Marvel pendant as a gift for a young girl. It is solid and the colors are vibrant.
5.0,As advertised. My wife loves them...
5.0,"Great bag for any situation, I use for clinical setting. Lots of space and storage options."
5.0,My kids and I wear these for both school and work and they are great. I don't even know mine is on but I am thankful because it means our masks won't hit the ground. It keeps me from touching the mask itself as well which I see as a huge plus wearing it all through the day.
5.0,"This is just the ticket for folks who want to carry their smartphone with them, but who don’t want to wear clothing with pockets.<br /><br />The only thing that could make this more impressive would be leather.<br /><br />Five stars out of five."
5.0,This is supposed to be compression gear so I can understand why the sizing is small.  I purchased a Mens M for my son who is 5'1 and 95 pounds and they fit loosely but could still be worn under a pair of jeans or snow pants. The arms were long for him of course but he is growing so fast. I'm hoping he can keep these for a few years.  The quality and feel are excellent with a nice soft fleece inside.  They washed well in warm water with no special treatment.  My husband is 5'11 and a muscular 160 and the fit was more like compression gear. He said they were very comfortable.
5.0,I LOVE this dress.  I am 6ft tall and 260lbs.  The dress fits beautifully.  I got so many compliments.  This is my 3rd dress from this group of dresses.
5.0,"Theres more padding on these shorts than I'm used to.  I have several black pairs, so I really like the navy color and they fit great."
5.0,"Great product, Gi is durable yet light, will definitely buy more of these!"
5.0,"Saw some pictures about this, and decided to buy. It is just amazing, you can mix several stuff and grid in different ways!"
5.0,I've already received compliments on this jacket and I've only had it 2 weeks.
5.0,My daughter loves her infinity scarf. Thanks!
5.0,The dress seems to be perfect for all occasions.  Have only tried it on.  Very comfortable and most importantly my husband really liked it.
5.0,"Beautiful bracelet, very sparkly but the stones don't look fake at all."
5.0,A very nice bracelet for the money. Would have expected to pay more for this item.
5.0,"This is little longer than I thought it would be, but that worked out fine. The chain is smooth- I have longish hair, and it does NOT catch in it.  It's holding the glasses well- as in, not slipping. I will order from this company again."
5.0,Ok so if you like shoes that hurt when you wear them. THIS IS THE SHOE FOR YOU. I got these for my aunt (she loves shoes that hurt) but she can only find slides of these kinds of shoes. I thought they would arrive in 2-3 weeks (as said in the delivery instructions). But they came the same week I ordered them. They look like they will last a LONG time. It seems a little small so order a little bigger. They came in perfect shape and not like the pictures of the other reviews. THEY LOOK EXACTLY  LIKE THE PICTURES. BTW I ordered a black and grey shoe.<br /><br />SO SORRY FOR THE LONG REVIEW.
5.0,ADOREI
5.0,So cute and protected my arms from the sun. I have lupus and I get tired of long sleeves. These are so much cooler than long sleeves plus they are fun! No fading when washed either!
5.0,"I'm in love it's so pretty and looks so good! Fits perfectly, maybe a little tight trying to get it on at the shoulders but really not a problem. I would buy 50 dresses just like it"
5.0,"Easily applied, adjustable,colorful, worth the money"
5.0,Very durable and long winter socks.  Perfect for Maryland winter weather.
5.0,Comfy<br />Throw it on over my bathing suit in the summer!
5.0,I love it. It's a great unique and cute necklace and it's cheap. A win win in my book.
5.0,This is very nice quality and is a lovely scarf. It was a gift and was very well received.
5.0,Super cute and durable!  Great buy.
5.0,Such a cute skirt
5.0,So cute!!!  My 1 year old is going to be an 80's workout instructor for Halloween.  Fits perfect (stretchy for larger children).
5.0,Perfect fit! Beautiful dress!
5.0,Very cute for a good price
5.0,The jacket fits great. it's warm and light weight.
5.0,These boots are beautiful and very comfortable to walk in. The leather smells amazing too. :-)
5.0,I am surprised at how comfortable these feel.  I like the feel and that I can put a filter in.  The cor choice was perfect for me.
5.0,This make the perfect Santa belt for our Santa suit.  Not cheap looking.
5.0,"I love this shirt. I received it today and am really excited to wear it this winter. I ordered the XL for a looser fit but this fits like a Large. That is ok because large is my normal size.  So I would say this runs a bit small. Gorgeous colors, super soft inside and out. Love it!"
5.0,Love the protection this hat offers.  And love that I can tie my hair in ponytail
5.0,They're comfortable and fit as expected
5.0,I bought this for my boyfriend. He called me this morning and didn't think anything of it since he calls every day. He told me he was using his cap. His voice was as clear as I have ever heard him. He said the music sounded really clear also. He is very happy with it.
5.0,"Stunning , great size and very well made."
5.0,These glasses are awesome for a Sophia costume (Golden Girls)!!!
5.0,Even though for men/boys I ordered them for myself because you just can't find women moccasins without the fur!  I ordered the Small and they fit perfectly for a woman who wears between a 8.5 and 9 shoe (even with swollen feet they are comfy).  Keep feet warm. Well made.  Fast delivery and packaged very well.  My only complaint would be I wish they came in a Extra Small because my daughter keeps stealing mine!  Would definitely order again.
5.0,"Does not scratch easily, good material."
5.0,"nice gloves, warm and a very nice color  and look.<br />they work well."
5.0,Way better than the silocone band that came with the watch. More breathable and dries better.
5.0,"Insane how cheap this is! Took over a week to arrive but who cares for the price. Got two for me so I sometimes layer the length of each for a cool look. Got one for my sister too.<br /><br />Obviously not real silver, but again worth it for the price. Also one necklace was kind of bent, but its barely noticeable so I still wear it a lot. Found a matching pair of earrings.<br /><br />Love cheap items that turn into a favorite! Had mine for several months and I'm kind of surprised it hasn't tarnished."
5.0,"Active AF, why did i get this belt? Because it makes wearing blues more comfortable."
5.0,"I absolutely love these pajamas.  They wash and dry very well and are extremely comfortable.  I highly recommend these.<br />However, the top runs a little big but not enough to return them.  I plan on ordering another set but will order a medium instead of a large.<br /><br />Pat Googe"
5.0,kinda see through at the bottom but besides that it was PERFECT!! So sparkly
5.0,I love the fact I can change my watch band ever day. Or wear to color coordinate with my clothes
5.0,These earrings are extremely BEAUTIFUL and very high quality stone and metal. They are Onyx and Rose Gold. They shipped fast and in a pretty little box. The store owner is very nice and professional. You will not regret making a purchase from this store! Very high quality jewelry. 5/5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💜
5.0,Surprising quality and value. I have not had any issues with it ripping or breaking. I alternate this bag with one other bag and I have had it for some months now and it's just as good as new.
5.0,"Perfect for airport travel, city touring.  Don't overload the pockets!<br />Good quality, not too baggy, or too fitted. Could be too warm over 70 degrees."
5.0,"I haven't had a chance to use this yet, but I know I will like it when I don't need to take the kitchen sink with me.....although it might hold it. Lots of space in a smaller bag.<br /><br />P.S. I now have 2 of these and I really do like them for the space available and because the are lightweight."
5.0,It is a great hat. I ordered blue but changed my mind to black and they came through and shipped black. I love it.
5.0,"Like this key chain very much.  I like the brass, and it fits on the edge of my purse beautifully."
5.0,fits perfect !
5.0,"Cannot give this enough stars! Comfortable and flattering. I've worn it casual and to work. Cannot beat the price, either."
5.0,Beautiful thanks
5.0,"Really well fitting and comfortable. They are very sturdy and stylish. I really liked the contrast between the yellow and black soles. Excellent value, as eell"
5.0,Comfortable and rugged replacement bands for any 18mm watch. I have found these quite useful on an old Timex Ironman.
5.0,I will be getting another one ...This is great
5.0,"looks super real, just have to adjust it right. it does hurt a bit after having it in for a while."
5.0,"These toddler tennis shoes are an excellent find and purchase! My son wears a size 8, but his feet are growing rapidly, so I bought a size 9. These are a little big, but actually fit well and now he can grow into them.<br />What I most like about these shoes is how light-weight they are. My son says he can run &#34;super fast&#34;. These are also easy to put on since they have no laces. My son is three, and he can put these on himself (which he really likes!).<br />I recommend these shoes!"
5.0,Most awesome and handy bag! Finally I found my match! One bag that I can use to carry all my stuff! I love it and it withstands glamorously a lot of weight and expansion! Thank you!
5.0,"I am extremely happy with my purchase of the [[ASIN:B01E75HXSK &#34;Felix&#34; Women's Designer Retro Round Cateye Sunglasses with Mirror Lens (Tort w/ Blue)]]! I got the Tortoise w/ Blue Lens. When they arrived, they were packaged nicely in a black little bag, wrapped in bubble wrap. Please note that the quality of these glasses is reflected in the price. You are not getting top of the notch sunglasses, simply a fun/trendy pair to wear around town. I tend to lose sunglasses pretty often, so I am fully confident these will last until I either lose them or want the new trend next summer. I love the style of them and how fun and beachy I feel when I'm wearing them. I also love the fact that they have the nose pads. I have a smaller nose/face so when I wear heavy sunglasses without nose pads I can easily get headaches. These are lightweight and comfortable! I will note that one of my lenses had a tiny nick on it (something that must have happened in manufacturing and pre-shipping) however it is so small and doesn't affect my viewing through the lens that I am still giving these 5 stars. They are slightly larger than I was expecting, but the oversizedness makes them that much more fun! Definitely recommend. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
5.0,Great beanie! Looks good & my brother  loved it
5.0,THANKS!
5.0,My Grandson likes them and they look so cute on him. Very well made and fit perfectly.
5.0,"Bought them on based on the reviews here, and am glad I did.  We used them for a Halloween costume, but they will be great for dress up for several more years.  My 3.5 year old loves them!"
5.0,Fits funky in my mouth
5.0,Just received jacket very pleased with fit and finish good quality zipper is a pain but you can get use to it
5.0,"Bought these for myself.  Opened the box, gave all 4 a 'short wind' and each mechanism worked as it should.  Haven't worn them yet, but they seem well-built and work as described.  So far, I really like them and think they will look outstanding."
5.0,"I love to layer and this vest is great.  Lightweight for spring and summer.  Runs a little small, so I ordered 1 size bigger.  I am ordering another color right now."
5.0,Great fit. Comfortable. No giant seam in the toes.  Holding up well in the wash.
5.0,Once I wore them in they’ve been great boots.
5.0,Super soft awesome fitting shirt
5.0,"Fits like a glove. The material is stretchy. I ordered a size L, Because M wasn’t available and I’m expecting. But them M would’ve been just fine."
5.0,Size is as advertised.  Socks are comfortable and wearable all day long.  Definitely will continue to use and purchase again
5.0,I love these shoes wish they would make more like this.<br />It's nice as an adult to wear fund shoes.

5.0,So convenient to use.  I workout on the way to work and take the blender with me to have a shake after my workout.  Holds its charge for a long period of time and mixes very well.
5.0,My husbands new favorite shirt! I call it the shirt of many colors! Its very thin and light. Great for the summers here in Florida!
5.0,Great Christmas Present.. she loved them
5.0,"These pajamas are absolutely adorable!  I love the green stripes and the cuffs on the wrists and ankles.  My son is almost 6 but very slim and this 4 is just a bit small on him.  The fit is very snug, as the company states in the description for the safety of the child.  The length seems a little long for a size 4.<br /><br />The quality of the pajamas is what sets them apart.  They are 100% organic cotton and you can feel the difference.  They are thicker and very soft.  The price is a bit more than I would spend on a single pair of pajamas, but for the quality of product and material used it is understandable.  I would definitely recommend this brand and these PJs."
5.0,These are well worth the money and perfect for the skateboarder enthusiast! Item arrived as scheduled and is exactly as described.
5.0,"Washed it before my son wore it and it  still looked brand new. My son gets hot easily, so sometimes he'll change out of it. I don't think it traps sweat or heat too much. The material is somewhat thick but good quality. It also has the minecraft tag on it to make it legit."
5.0,Great bag. Good quality andi’s the perfect size.
5.0,overall a good buy
5.0,I loved the way it fits me!

5.0,Beautiful necklace and fast friendly service!
5.0,"The length of the dress was perfect for me. I’m 5’5” and 170 pounds. It was perfect for our friends outdoor wedding. I did wear a black tank top under it, since the material was a little see through."
5.0,"This dress fit perfectly, my new favorite!! Perfect for summer"
5.0,High quality product. Great for my daughters sports! We will be buying more.
5.0,These are packaged really nice and are made well.  Giving as Christmas gifts
5.0,"Present for my grand daughter who just loves anything &#34;SNOOPY&#34;, she was thrilled to have this unique necklace for her collection and to wear."
5.0,"I was somewhat hesitant to buy another dress from amazon because the last one I bought was absolutely terrible. The worst material, super tight in the chest area, I couldnt move in it and it was a horrible decision on my end but I read all of the reviews for this dress and I'm no size 5 so I purchased the large and the shipping was great as always, the packaging was simple and the dress was super clean. Once I put the dress on, I was in love! Great material, super comfortable, I'm 5' 3&#34; so it was a little long but once I put the heels one, it was perfect. I will definitely buy this dress again in the green and gray because I purchased the black! Ladies, this dress is amazing. And this slit makes you feel absolutely gorgeous when dancing. I was complimented all night long at my friends wedding. Buy this for sure!!"
5.0,Love it thank you
5.0,Super nice and beautiful!!!
5.0,"I purchased this as a Valentine's Day gift for my guy and he carries it regularly on trips. It's true, originally when it's brought out of the packaging there is an odor due to the dye. I aired it out in my closet for a week with fabric softener inside and that fixed it. I like the appearance, quality and size. Another bonus was no leather (cruelty free) as it's made with a strong canvas."
5.0,the light is wonderful .. I love this cell phone cover to use when there is not much light!
5.0,My daughter hasn't worn them yet but they fit her perfectly.
5.0,"Buen producto, buen costo"
5.0,A lil tight next time I will get a size 12 instead of 11
5.0,"My daughter out grew size 10 in kids for Disney and she wanted pjs. These are an XS, a little big on her but I assumed since she is a size 12 in kids. But great feel and my daughter loves them."
5.0,Super cute.  Fit was a little loose like I wanted.  Wings on the arms are really fun and added a lot to the costume. A little itchy but not bad.

5.0,Roomy fit.  Nice fabric and screen print has held up well after lots of washes.
5.0,I love it! The colors are bright and rich. The beads are strung together very well. A high quality piece at a great price!!
5.0,"Perfect fit, but I’d recommend wearing a slip, to hide panty lines and bra lines.  It’s lightweight, but not see-through."
5.0,It was exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,As described!  Genuine leather!
5.0,"If you just had a baby, or you have a little extra bits to hide, buy this bathingsuit!<br />I'm 5'10"" and around 170 lbs and this bathingsuit was great when I went to visit my family this summer! I got so many compliments on it! The over all quality is really good as is the material. In real life, the color is purple/blue and should go with just about any skin tone.<br />I felt good wearing it. Its classy but also made me feel beautiful. There is a built in bra type thing so I didn't have to worry about anything ""escaping"".<br />Would recommend."
5.0,I love these glasses! They really do look real. I have people telling me I didn’t know you wear glasses?!? I love to change my look a lot and these help me with that.

5.0,"Good product...<br />This is a gift, so I can’t comment anymore, at this time.."
5.0,Product As Described. Would Reccomend.
5.0,My 9 year old daughter loved these glasses. I was able to bend the ear pieces a little bit so the glasses fit her head tighter. Would totally recommend.
5.0,"I've ordered a dozen of cheaper gloves/mitts trying to save a bit of money - ended up returning all of them (too bulky, felt cheap, some had really strange membranes, which felt like a piece of plastic).<br /><br />These feel great - premium leather, great cut. They were a bit too warm when the temperature went above 30, but felt great between 10 and 30. My hands get cold easily, so I might get something heavier for colder weather or will try these ones with a pair of liner gloves.<br /><br />I'm usually between L and XL and in this case L were a bit too short and XL was a perfect fit with a bit of room, but not too much."
5.0,True fit and comfortable but would not encourage long walks on hard surfaces.
5.0,So cute and casual. Nice quality.
5.0,"Very cute, matches quite alot of outfits."
5.0,"I absolutely love these Boho tassel earrings! Not as heavy as they looked. Comfortable to wear. Thinking about purchasing more in other colors, but red is my favorite. 🥰"
5.0,"I ordered this on a in pulse buy since it was only $9.99! What a great deal, I've been wearing this dress all day and it fits so comfortably.<br />I'm a size 12/14 and I ordered and L, it fits great.  I received so many compliments and people thought my dress was super expensive given I was at a business reception during lunch with many execs.  I paired it with a sparkly necklace to give it a fancy touch.  I just ordered another color today!"
5.0,What I was expecting. Easy to adjust size using provided tools.
5.0,My boy only likes these underwear. They are comfortable and soft.
5.0,Family member stated they liked the warmth and comfort of socks.
5.0,"I got one in Mauve and another in black. Both are beautiful, soft and perfect fit. Love the length too since I am 5'8."
5.0,Pretty for what I wanted. Looks like pictured.
5.0,"My son loves the pants. They’re a little big, but have adjustable cinches at the waist. Very nice colors."

5.0,Love my red boots. But I through that the were bright red doe. But I still love them I can walk in them all day conformable<br />.
5.0,"Glad I ordered a small. Medium would be too large. I'm 5' 3"" and it's just above the knee.  Weigh 134lbs and a 34b.  Not real form fitting but that's what is shown in picture."
5.0,Great item. Fabric is nice and soft which I greatly appreciated especially on the first few months where my breasts were always sore due to engorgement. Helped me a lot. Definitely recommended.
5.0,"Fit perfect, and are comfortable."
5.0,"I love the glasses, they cut out the glare. When I fish I can see clearly in the water and see the fish. They are very light weight, so you can ware them all day and not have lines where the nose pads are on your face. They are very flexible so they will not break if they get bent or twisted. They cut out any glare or bright light that can hurt your eyes. I will be getting another pair, they are worth every penny."
5.0,The only thing you need for cleaning jewelry! Works so well. Makes you want to clean jewelry. A quick wipe on this and all my jewelry is shiny again.
5.0,Awesome for the price. My daughter loves it.
5.0,"Absolutely love this Best Friend Satchel that I own five bags!!! Better prices on Amazon!!! These bags keep you organized and if you're not into big handbags then this isn't for you. I love the watch and flashlight and small mirror that comes with the bag. The zipper on the outside of handbag is convenient for keys and cell phone. I love the size of the bags and the make of the bag. I own aqua, whiskey, blue, tan and rose quartz (pink)."
5.0,"I'm a big fan of these sunglasses. The shape and style is very hip and in right now, and I'm surprisingly a fan of the brown fade on the lenses. Others CAN see your eyes when you're wearing these, so definitely be mindful (to be honest, sometimes I like dark shades, so I can people watch and stare without being rude haha). But I've had no issues with the make or quality of these. Overall, very pleased!"
5.0,So soft. I love their feel. A bit loose. But I can roll the top down and they sit perfect.
5.0,Very cute.  The green top is heer and sexy.  Looks great and material is nice.
5.0,Awesome breathable my son loves them draw string on them are perfect
5.0,Fun Keychain for our son's car we named Sonic!  Good weight and durability!
5.0,Bought this item as a Christmas gift. It made a very nice addition to my son’s keychain collection.
5.0,"These earrings are high quality and the luster on pearls is fabulous,"
5.0,Cute fits my daughter as expected. No significant shrinkage after the first wash & dry.
5.0,Everyone wants my bag! I got mud dolor.
5.0,"I decided to go with these because I work out and knew that after my flight I'd be able to use them in workouts. They also have the same grade of compression as all of the ugly medical socks I saw posted on here. My husband and I were moving from Hawaii back to the Mainland, and I was about 29 weeks pregnant, so the doctor told me to wear compression socks or hose to help avoid swelling and cut down on the risk of blood clots. I had flown a few months earlier at 12 and 15 weeks, and I was shocked at how much my ankles (which I'm not a sweller normally) blew up. Since I was further along, I chose to heed the doc's advice and get some compression socks. These worked like a champ! I took the same flight from Honolulu to Atlanta, and this time while wearing the socks, I barely had any swelling at all.  I'd definitely recommend if you're a pregnant person looking to keep from swelling on a long flight!"
5.0,Love these sports bras! The adjustable straps are great and the front zipper makes it super easy to take out after a sweaty workout. I took out the padding and it made it even more comfortable.
5.0,STURDY!  Clerks tend to see how much and how heavy they can fill these bags -- but they take the abuse AND the straps make moving them from cart to car to kitchen easy.  Really DO insulate so cold items STAY cold in SEALED container.
5.0,This belt is very good especially when you are losing weight!
5.0,"Those three are for my husband. And I received mine, and they're great!"
5.0,Super cute and comfy! My daughter wears them all th3 Time!
5.0,"Was very happy with the fit, color and fabric!<br />I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, lightweight dress!!!"
5.0,Great price and selection for teen.
5.0,These are great some are smaller then others but I love them. I will definitely order more !
5.0,Perfect weight and stretch. So comfy and does not hug any bulges. Love this dress. Going to purchase another print right now!
5.0,"I adore the bright colors!!! Comfy,  cozy and keep my feet warm and stylish."
5.0,"They're comfortable,  pretty and nickel free."
5.0,Very soft and well made for the price. Nice colors and VERY warm. Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,I bought this scarf to wear with a black coat and a red coat. It looks fabulous with both and has a blanket-like coziness. Beautifully made!
5.0,Very well made wallet and I'm delighted with the security features.  The size is just right and the leather is a nice quality.<br />Highly recommend this wallet to others.
5.0,"Got for my wife as an anniversary gift. It was smaller then I expected, but my wife liked it very much."
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it. It's the perfect size and can hold a lot!
5.0,A bit larger then an actual 1 x but works and looks good on me
5.0,"Absolutely love them! I have sunglass specifically for running, and these are just as great! I am a highly active person, and these are perfect. Whether you want to sport them casually or workout in, they're perfect. Durable, classy, and fun."
5.0,"Good quality for the price! The keys holder bag was a little smaller than I expected, but overall a very good buy."
5.0,Fit like a glove! I looked great. Bought it in nude and black.
5.0,I used it for a Dooney & Bourke bag
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:55b6db9c0fa16d6e2d3adec24f51de29]] Product arrived as advertised. I had seen reviews from previous users so I knew what to expect. Band feels sturdy and has a matte texture which I prefer from shiny bands I normally buy. Matched my black apple watch 7 nicely and throughout the day the bands feel very comfortable and love the rugged look, but at the same time it's not too bulky. Product is highly recommended for the price tag (you get two for less than 15$, can't beat that)"
5.0,This hat is amazing! It’s my 2nd one from this company. The buttons for my mask are in the perfect place which is super hard to find with medical caps. I will be back to purchase more !
5.0,I read they Rand small so ordered a 12 for child that wore 10. She loves them!
5.0,My cousin has a French Bulldog that she Absolutely Loves. So for her Birthday I went on a French Bulldog Amazon Shopping Spree. I got her this tan colored Frenchie keychain with someother Frenchie gifties. It's Absolutely Adorable. She Loved it. Looks just like her Frenchie Fur baby up to the Black metal collar.
5.0,"Love this band. Matches all watch colors and protective cover colors. I got the red watch, but didn’t want a solid red band. Pics are after wearing about 1 months, every day, all day. It stays in place after you adjust it. When it gets dirty, I just wear it into the shower and suds it up. The texture is much nicer than the plain elastic bands, but still so soft that I don’t even know I have it on. I also get lots of compliments."
5.0,"Great item, I bought two. Very soft and well made."
5.0,Awesome bag
5.0,Russell sweats are premium clothing. You can’t compare them to other brands like Walmart.<br />I’ve bought several sweats from this company and they are great.
5.0,"Very cute dress, great colors and fits well, my only complaint is that it is see through, but otherwise I Iove it!"
5.0,"Really good quality, considering its made in china.love it!"
5.0,"Love the rectangular lenses.  Also, the lenses are not super dark, more of an amber, which I think is very stylish.  I get compliments on these sunglasses every day."
5.0,Got this in a small fits on me like a medium. But it works for me. The lining is thin so its kinda see through so you definitely have to wear a dark slip underneath.
5.0,Shoes are comfortable and I love the heel.  They also make your outfit look dressy too.
5.0,well worth it
5.0,Color is true Wine - sublime.
5.0,Love my new socks!!
5.0,Was hesitant about this top b/c I'm not a small woman and rather thick around the middle. It is extremely flattering on. Have washed it twice so far and recommend doing so on delicates so as not to damage the trim. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"So glad I had these for my wedding! They slid right on and stayed there, so I didn't have to worry about losing them as I walked, and it kept me from sinking in the grass or stumbling over gravel and uneven stone pathways. (It also helped keep me stable on flat ground, since it provided extra surface to walk on and I'm horrible in heels!)"
5.0,Very roomy and cute! Absolutely love it! Thank you for a great oroduct!
5.0,This umbrella is cute and my granddaughter wants to use it even when it's not raining!
5.0,"They are a lot nicer looking than I expected - very shiny, and the perfect size for my smallish lobes. One earring came broken, and I had to call them to see what they could do about it. I got right through (no being put on hold) and they were so kind on the phone. They told me to go ahead and discard the first pair, that they would triple check a replacement to make sure it was perfect, and send it out immediately at no charge. They arrived about 2 days later, and, as promised, were perfect. This company has the best customer service - I would go out of my way to order from them again."
5.0,Muy hermoso y de buena calidad
5.0,I've only had them a week . great for driving so far . Going golfing in Myrtel  next week and to the beach after that hope they work.
5.0,"I ordered this blouse in Size: Large and Color: Aqua blue. For reference, I'm 5'1&quot;, 125 lbs and measure 34, 29 and 35 so basing on the size chart I got the large size. Turns out large is a little loose on me but it doesn't look too bad because the style of this blouse is a little loose.<br /><br />I didn't expect much from this blouse. I thought it's going to be similar to all the cheap chiffon blouses but this turns out to be different. I was so thrilled when I saw this blouse and tried it on because the chiffon fabric that was use was really a good quality. I also like the style of this shirt. I think it looks great in a skirt, shorts and boyfriend jeans.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice chiffon blouse and very well made.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,I used these for a maternity boudior shoot. They were super cute!
5.0,"I love this bag!  It is beautiful and great quality.  Plenty of room for all of my stuff including my 15 inch laptop.  I love all the compartments!  I was able to combine 3 bags into 1.  The only negative, I also read in another review, is that it does not stand up on it's own. I have to prop it against something."
5.0,Quick shipping. Item seems durable and fit is as expected for size.
5.0,Fits glasses perfectly
5.0,"In less than 24 hours I am SOLD on this litter for life!  A) My house doesn't stink anymore!  B) My cat 'Smokey' jumped right in and did her business straight away, I think she really likes it!  C) NO DUST!  Not what I was expecting from the tiny granuals but was shocked at no cloud of dust.  D) Clumping Crystal Litter?!?!  This stuff blew my mind, clumps were solid and easy to clean this morning.  I'm very happy with this product and have already added it to my cart for my next purchase.  Must try - 5 stars of PAWSOME!!"
5.0,"Very nice watch, I'm glad I ordered it."
5.0,Order on Friday and received on Sunday.  The material is like a satin but truly not Satin. I love this skirt.  My thighs are extremely big so I couldn't step into it.  I placed it over my head and pulled it down.  It came packaged nicely.  I ordered a long one as well in blue and gold and I can't wait to wear it.  I have received so many compliments on it!
5.0,Turns out they have memory foam inside that doesn't go flat when you wear them. The fit amazingly. And hold up good too. And are amazing for the price.
5.0,Love ❤ fabric. Style fits nicely.
5.0,I love these pants! I'm obsessed. I ordered 2 more pairs. The other patterns fabrics are slightly different but they are so comfortable and they are super fashionable.
5.0,Awesome Product. Just as expected!
5.0,"I can imagine overloading the backpack and the top stitch for the back straps becoming loose. However I was also born in 1979 and well duh.... custom stitch it with friggin fishing line or whatever for 85$ it's a big lightweight backpack some modifications are necessary like more pockets on the outside. Likely only the owner will be using it so ""mod"" the hell out of it sew on patches glitter, and of course duct tape."
5.0,Very beautiful with the beautiful box and special thank you card.
5.0,Such a good looking watch!!

5.0,"Love these pants! I’m 5’9” and wear a size 16, and based on the reviews saying to order up, I ordered the xxl (usually I’m an xl) and while they are a bit big in the waist, the legs and length are perfect!! Nice stretch and material, and they kept their shape all day.  Just ordered another pair in a different color."
5.0,"Best dress 👗 from Amazon ,<br />Color, length, material still<br />Size ….everything!!!"

5.0,"I love this product I currently work in the health care field and it goes very well and it does the job. very durable, comftable, good quality"
5.0,"Shipped quickly,  well packaged. It was exactly what I ordered and is super cute. There is a left and a right strap so keep that in mind when changing them. I kept the orginal cardboard packaging to store my extras on so as not to mix them up. I love these shoes and the extra straps!"
5.0,I was very pleasantly surprised by how nice this dress is. Fits just right. I am 5”8 224lbs I got the XL. Can’t wait to wear it to a friends wedding.
5.0,Very hip sunglasses Moschino out did they self with the sunglasses
5.0,"I bought these boots as a gift for my adult daughter. She says they were comfortable out of the box, and even more comfortable a couple of days later. Frye boots are the best. I wore Fryes and introduced them to my daughter years ago. And it seems like I’m still buying them for her."

5.0,"Super cute, true to size"
5.0,Perfect for the 4th.
5.0,"I suffered compartment syndrome in both legs (run over by loader), severe muscle damage, dr prescribed me full length compression stockings (which I hate with a passion, uncomfortable, hot, itchy, plus being a man I don't feel right wearing them lol).  these socks are amazing, and comfortable, plus keep the muscles from swelling just as good as the prescribed stockings,, price is very reasonable (I forget to use coupons when ordering new) but compared to the 100+ my ins payed for the others I don't mind fitting the bill for these"

5.0,"I’m 5’3” and 180lbs. The length is perfect, just at my knees. Most of my weight is in my mid-section. It’s a little loose around my mid-section but I like it. I probably could have gotten it one size smaller, a large (I got an extra large). It’s soft and warm though."
5.0,"Comfy!  Fits well, intact w working buttons and zipper, love the length, perfect for cold days!  Looking to see if you have other colors!"

5.0,"this is super adorable but it is somewhat short for a scarf that i'm used to (i usually buy big scarfs that reach to my bellybutton or longer and this one is just around my breastline). probably intended for kids but still adorable, would still buy again at this price!"
5.0,I love that it's adjustable it's not too tight.

5.0,I love this dress! It fits my body perfectly and holds everything in place. the material is amazing- it’s thick and stretches enough but not too much. The slit goes pretty high and it doesn’t manage to expose anything when walking. Perfect for the summer!

5.0,"I bought two of these for me and my boyfriend. These are great and don't look<br />Overly masculine or feminine they seem to be stitched very solidly and the fabric is thick so they're decently warm. I ordered them in a size too big for layering over other jackets in the upcoming cold weather. Could be worn by itself if its chilly, or layered over other clothes if its really cold."

5.0,Purchased as a gift. Arrived well packaged. Picture is accurate and scarf seems very well made. Would order from this supplier again.
5.0,"Honestly I don't even really wear regular bras anymore. These are so comfy! I'm a 5'7"" 150lbs 36DDD and I bought an XL. Usually the band on an XL is too big for me, but if I go smaller then the bra won't cover my boobs. This is perfect. Only downside is support- I don't go running in these bras! But maybe an easy jog!"
5.0,These amethyst gemstones appear authentic and are very sturdy.  Beautiful for necklaces and I use them as an addition to my macrame products.
5.0,I love these glasses I bought these for my niece/daughter for Christmas and I know she too.will love them.Thank you

5.0,For the price this is a phenomenal scarf
5.0,This Jiji sweater is cute and fits well.
5.0,"I LOVE this bag!!! It is a lot bigger and better quality then  I ever expected. It is very deep inside with multiple pockets. The outside material is solid,not cheap, will be able to wipe down easily. Only complaints would be the  strap is a little thin, and the inside is brown ,gold hardware on zippers and strap, but  grommets for eyes are silver, a bit odd. Still super cute though!"
5.0,"Purchased for CMA fest in Nashville.<br />Great quality!<br />Sturdy plastic with large adjustable strap.<br />Fits all of our daily needs.<br />Able to put a small water bottle in (however, can't zip it closed)<br />Highly recommend for concerts/festivals/games"

5.0,I love it. I ordered another shade also

5.0,So happy with the glasses I bought for my son he loves them
5.0,"Great Quality<br />Tapered fit could be a bit more<br />Ordered this for my husband who is 6ft 170lbs<br />Was way to bit ,he has long arms so that's why I ordered  the 17.5 neck 37&#34; sleeve  and it says it is slim fit so I thought it would fit him fine<br />Well it didn't It was way to big<br />Not a seller's issue Mine taking a guest on the size due to the description stating that it is a slim fit<br />I live the quality so much for the price that  I didn't want to return it, so I thought of my brother and it fits him perfectly!<br />SEE PICS , notice the removable caller pins, nice square buttons on the cuff, really nice fit .<br />my Brother is 5ft9 and 180lbs though it is a bit long the Shir fits him perfectly and he was so happy to have it !"
5.0,It’s so unique and fun. Family loves it!  I highly recommend.
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much as the photos don't do these shirts justice, but I ordered one in black and one in maroon and they look fantastic!  Unlike MANY of the clothes on Amazon, both colors were the exact same size.  The material is stretchy and thick enough to be forgiving but not so thick that your curves are washed out.  I would definitely buy these again, one of the better clothing purchases on Amazon!"
5.0,Good product !!!!!
5.0,"These shorts are comfortable and the liner provides a measure of modesty. The rear pocket is ideal for driver's license and charge card, just what you need while out. Need XL even though I've got my waist size down to 34. Unfortunately, only medium was available today for reorder."
5.0,The material is excellent...the pants are a touch small but fit me pretty well (I am an XL). I think it would be way too small for 2X.
5.0,"Perfect fit, came in time for Christmas party. I enjoy a little plaid this season."
5.0,They were packaged beautifully and gift box was inside a lacy bag. They look stunning on and made a beautiful gift for Christmas for a friend. Thank you so much
5.0,Very lovely necklace. Dainty but durable. Love the color. Matches wonderfully with the rest of my day-to-day jewelry. I've been wearing it for two weeks straight even in the shower and no issues so far.
5.0,"Love this dress! Very sexy, yet wearable. The material is quite thin so it shows off my imperfections, but not too thin to where it is super see through... But it IS light pink, so nude undergarments or a slip are good ideas."
5.0,weeoeoo!
5.0,Loved the variety of designs
5.0,"I have given this umbrella (love all the designs!) to dear friends, and bought one for myself as well.  I LOVE it!  So easy, brilliant design and works beautifully while giving me a happy view despite the rainy day!"
5.0,"I just got this bag, and I love it so much! Backstory: I have a standard size Re-Kanken that I love, and I’ve been eyeing the minis for a while. I have a couple trips coming up, including Disney, so I finally splurged on a Kanken Mini, thinking it would be a great carryall/purse/personal bag. When I got it the front and side pockets were so small I couldn’t even fit my phone in them. Then I saw this, and I am so happy I ordered. It seems really durable, and I honestly like the material so much better. The straps are adjustable for all sizes (this one does not have the snaps that some other reviewers complained about). The front pocket is roomier & a great size for a phone + multiple small items, the side pockets are big enough for water bottles, and the main compartment has several organizing pouches. There is also a small zipper pouch on the back for cards/cash/valuables (it’s a tight squeeze for a phone there). The overall size is only slightly bigger than the Kanken mini, but it holds more and is better organized. It’s a bit too small for a MacBook Air 13 in., but it fits an iPad with room to spare. Due to the size it’s not going to work as a school bag for standard sized textbooks, binders, laptop, etc., but I think it’s going to be great for travel. I also plan to use it regularly for knitting and crochet and to carry water and snacks to my son’s ball games. I still like the Fjallraven brand, but I’m pretty happy to find this awesome dupe for the mini. For reference I got the Maroon color, which I don’t see listed currently, but it’s pretty true to what was pictured online."
5.0,Bought them for my husband and he loves them. Keeps his hands nice and warm.
5.0,"Finally my hands are warm and gloves are roomy I can bend my fingers with no problem. The color is just the right shade of dark brown to go with my coat. Well worth ordering them, love them!"
5.0,"It is so cute! I've had comments on it from cashiers when I pull it out of my purse and open it up. It is soft enough to live in my purse and just the right size for 2 loaves of bread, a carton of eggs, and a small bag of chips. And, even if the bag itself falls apart, it would be easy enough to sew another one and attach it to the coffee cup.<br /><br />Update: I've received so many responses for my original coffee cup, I got a few more of these to use for Christmas gifts."
5.0,Love these little snow guys. Great add to our Christmas decor.
5.0,Super cute! Fits perfectly! So excited to wear it out!
5.0,"Super cute bathing suit, fits as expected."
5.0,Feminine earrings. Pretty pink color. The pink is not overwhelming. We'll made. I wear with dressy outfits and we'll put together business casual outfits. The earrings catch light when I wear for a night on the town.
5.0,Love the quality and the fit.
5.0,"Softly structured, nicely weighted material, silky smooth feel, flows nicely, closes/covers completely at bust and hips, falls to my ankles (I'm 5'5""), rich colors, the belt is a generous length, and deep pockets are at the seams.  Exactly what I wanted."
5.0,"Very cute, is a little loose. I ordered a M, was unsure if it would shrink & it did not. Soft material. I recommend."
5.0,"Got this top for $6.89. I love the print so much! First, I thought, this top for $7?! I bet the materials were so cheap, so I gambled. I got the item sooner than I expected, and when I tried it on, I'm in love! It is somewhat shear looking, but you can wear it with white cami or white bra. I got the small one, and I didn't regret it. I'm usually small to medium size(120 lbs, 5'4&#34;) depending on the brand, but I'm always size small in Forever 21, and this one is not really fitted on me. After I all, it's worth the gamble."
5.0,I LOVE THE SET AND IT LOOKS GREAT ON ME AND I WILL PURCHASE MORE SILVER AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER THANKS 😊
5.0,Very pretty earrings. Wore them a couple times with no issues so far.
5.0,It looks and feels great for the price!!!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Thank you!
5.0,Well-built.
5.0,Amazing shorts for the price!  Felt so trendy but fit was amazing - not too short and definitely not “Mom” shorts!
5.0,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,They are very nice and what a great price. They were a little uncomfortable wearing them to walk around for a long time because they dont have the best insides but I purchased a cushion shoe insert and now I Love them. I have these in 3 colors so far
5.0,Beautiful purse for a little girl. Somehow I thought it was a backpack.
5.0,perfect for front pocket. cutouts allow easy access. band great for folded bills.
5.0,Love my flag mask wear it all the time
5.0,Perfect gifts.
5.0,I was very impressed with the earrings and can not wait to show them off.
5.0,"The length and width are true to size.  The straps are a little snug over the top of the foot.  This allows for a more secure fit than other flip flops.  If your feet have more redundant tissue, they may be a little too tight for comfort.  Arch support is very good and soles provide plenty of cushion."
5.0,Nice hat fits well....
5.0,Durable. Long lasting. Nice color.
5.0,"As described, works, and is well stitched."
5.0,Fits great.  And I have a small wrist
5.0,Odd sizing and is very long.
5.0,"fits great, looks great, nice fabric. I did sew up the slit since its a bit too much and when you seat you will have problems lol. Other than that no complains."
5.0,"I ordered these to wear with short ""booties"" -- they really don't show when I wear the boots and they are just tall enough to cover lower ankle so short boots don't rub and irritate my feet.  And they really do not slide down into my shoes.--that it what I like most about them.  I wear them with tennis shoes also--comfortable and thin.  Very good purchase."
5.0,quick and easy thanks
5.0,I have been looking for this floating stimulated diamonds necklace for sometime and happy to purchase this one.  Good length and fits me nicely.
5.0,I would like for the top to be a little bit longer otherwise it fit good
5.0,"Very pretty boots, super soft leather, uniquely cool look with red smooth leather turned-back collar, and great price compared to other prices I saw for the same boots on the internet. Grab them while you can!"
5.0,It’s good quality looks cool
5.0,They are sick they fit
5.0,Great scarf. Think n long.  Not bulky.
5.0,"I gave it 5 stars for cuteness, however, I haven't ordered yet. I'm reading the reviews and seeing the customer disappointment. It may not have shown it in the description when they ordered it, although, right now, today, it is clearly stated under the picture ""black-sister"" showing that the selection has been limited to one choice, and perhaps the ""black-brother"" outfit is either no longer available, or out of stock.<br />I wouldn't have expected much anyway if I'd just paid $16.95 for 2 adorable outfits. Now that would make me suspect shoddy quality. I do appreciate the effort that was made to even leave a written review, because it means that this was an important matter that deserved attention.<br />And, what's the deal with the adult sized height & weight? That one totally left the party."
5.0,This is a very pretty necklace.  It comes with a nice velvet lined box with a padded lid.  The necklace itself comes in a double zipper bag to keep the pendant itself untangled from the rest of the chain during shipment.  This is very nice.  It also comes with a polishing cloth square to help keep the pendant clean.  The display board in the box is high quality and makes for a great presentation for giving the necklace as a gift.<br /><br />The chain on this necklace is a bit thin with very small links.  The lobster claw is also on the small size which makes it a little difficult to put on although it doesn’t make taking it off difficult.  The chain length lets the pendant sit just below the throat.
5.0,Excellent product and excellent seller.  Best price I could find but I wish they were cheaper in the industry.  Am very grateful to have them due to immune deficiency issues in family.
5.0,Love this dress !
5.0,HAD TO ORDER A SMALLER SIZE AND THIS ONE FITS GREAT
5.0,I have a wide foot; these fit perfectly!  They have excellent support and I can adjust the width if I need to. I have a hard time finding shoes and slippers because  of the width. Stores tend not to carry many  extra wide shoes or slippers.  I am so happy I found these. I received them right away and they are worth every penny I paid for them.
5.0,This was actually bought for my daughter who loves stars. She loved this when she first saw it!!! I do believe she love it!!
5.0,"fits very well, was as expected - received quickly."
5.0,"Great product, got exactly what I expected."
5.0,"Cute dress, that is true to size. Wore it to a wedding and it was comfy and cute and worked for its intended purpose. Got it in black and it was fine."
5.0,"The XL fit a teensy bit tight so I ended up returning these for an XXL for 44 inch hips.  If you carry weight in upper thigh/hip area, size up.  I tried 3 different manufacturers and MEATHY was the only brand that I feel runs true to size.  I had originally ordered an XL in the black floral and returned for the aqua floral.  Hoping the sizing runs the same.  I will review the aqua when I receive it, but plan to order in each color as these shorts are well made and comfortable.<br /><br />It would be nice if there was a full inner, mesh liner.  These shorts do NOT have a liner."
5.0,My order was described perfectly and arrived at my door sooner than expected... Absolutely beautiful necklace!
5.0,Works good keeping the sun out of your eyes while driving and not too dark wearing them inside places if you want to look like a creeper or a douche bag!
5.0,I wore this yellow skirt for engagement pics and got many compliments! Super cute !
5.0,"I'm glad I ordered a large, even though I'm a medium. Fit just right. Order one size up. I'm 5'4 tall and 130 lbs."
5.0,This is even more impressive in person.
5.0,Great packaging great product
5.0,Very unique design and good quality.
5.0,"Got different colors of these for all of my friends. They love these a lot.<br />PRO:<br />- they look good if you like dress casual<br />- they mix good with watches<br />CONS:<br />- if you move your hand very fast, you have a slight chance to loose it."
5.0,"With the limited availability of brick and mortar stores near me, purchasing anything online in regards to proper fittings makes me somewhat hesitant. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well constructed and snug these boots were for my purchasing satisfaction. With price and quality in mind for purchasing, I’m not a disappointed online shopper."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my 17 y.o. daughter. She has such tiny delicate fingers, a size 5 will fit her index finger.  It’s difficult to find anything to fit her.  She loves kitties, and when I saw this fit 4-6, and was adjustable, I just had to get it.  She absolutely loved it!  And it’s the first ring she can wear on her ring finger.  She wears it all the time, and loves the little ears and the paw detailing."
5.0,"Looks just like the real deal, great find"
5.0,"I am in love with these boots. They are my new country music festival boots. Perfect amount of cute but also sexy. All my boots are 9.5 as are these and they fit perfect. If you're on the fence, don't be buy these you won't regret it."
5.0,Very nice dress belt!. Works well with various outfits.
5.0,SHIPPING WAS EXCELLENT AND FITTED PERFECT!
5.0,I love it..so delicate and fits my wrist perfectly..could not be happier..
5.0,The jeans fit perfectly.
5.0,fits me  and my 9 year old it just forms to your body.  well made.  son loves it . even wears it when watching TV!
5.0,"We bought these for my dad, and these are the only slippers he will wear. As soon as he gets home from work he changes into them and ABSOLUTELY love them!!!"
5.0,"Very useful, I like them!!!"
5.0,ACCORDING TO MY GRANDSON THEY ARE VERY NICE AND COMFORTABLE
5.0,A little see through but I love this dress is amazing for a beach cover up or add a jacket and going out to dinner.
5.0,I haven't used my socks for travel yet but I had ankle fusion surgery in July and the swelling in my ankle and the top of my foot was miserable. These socks immediately kept the swelling and discomfort down. On a bad night I also wear the sock to bed. Recommend them highly.
5.0,Better then expected LOVE Love Love them
5.0,Daughter loves it. Looks good on her. Not a bikini fan. Wife thinks so as well.
5.0,"I’m really impressed with the quality! I thought they would be like those cheap glasses holders you get at the dollar store, maybe just tough enough to hold a mask. But I believe they will work for my son’s GoPro too. The ribbon is thick and heavy and the clips seem to be too."
5.0,"Really great, thick material. Exactly what I was looking for!"
5.0,"Got these for work, working out in the elements!! Very Warm. Nice and thick! Very good quality! I will buy more!"
5.0,"The color is exactly as pictured and the same as my wedding color! I am using these as bridesmaids gifts. Nice quality, zippers are smooth and I love that it’s foldable to be used as an extra travel bag for trips. This bag is deep with extra storage spaces inside. I would not use for air travel but definitely great for road trips."
5.0,"I ordered this for my sister, her birthstone is pearl. It was such a great experience to watch her excitement as she opened the oyster to retrieve her own cream colored pearl."
5.0,"Love, Love Love them.  My kids love the bright yellow color and the cute smaller than most size.  They are perfect for soccer or school bag or to give as a gift to a friend.  The chain is strong and the color is vibrant.  They want 2 more sets.  Very quick to receive.<br />Thank you"
5.0,Great material. Cute shirt. Fit as expected.
5.0,This is my gift to my granddaughter for her 16th birthday. The photos do not do it justice.  This is gorgeous piece and i will order more.
5.0,"I love this watch! It's bold yet reserved and possibly on the edge of tacky without going over that line in my opinion but other may find it too much. The type of thing you don't notice until you do and then you cant stop looking at it! Never the less, I think its a perfect edition to anyones attire, holiday season or not. Seller shipped quick and it arrived in less than a week during black friday weekend! Must be a Christmas miracle lol"
5.0,So pretty very pleased with this item.
5.0,I've worn it several times and I like the sparkle of the stones.
5.0,So beautiful and well made! I’ve worn it almost every day since it arrived.
5.0,My son got this for his sister and she loved it.
5.0,"Gave it as a gift , she loved it"
5.0,"perfect for quick jaunts to the store, lightweight and colorful, nice print design"
5.0,Great sweatshirt for a very affordable price. Very comfortable.
5.0,Great price & great look!
5.0,Very comfortable material and fits nicely. I’m 5’6” 135 pounds and ordered a medium.
5.0,I wore this for my wedding shower and received a million compliments! Really nice fit and material!
5.0,"Plastic bracket keeps the face mask out of your mouth. Works great. Smells funny, but that's what you get when they're shipped from China. I had to wash them good and hope the smell dissipates over time. They make your face sweat a little, but still better than having face mask material right against your mouth."
5.0,Hat was a huge success. Purchased as Christmas gift.
5.0,"I love these shoes! They are cute, comfortable, and durable...all of which I need as a busy mom! I wear a size 9 and ordered a 9, and the sizing is spot on."
5.0,This is a very good belt. I bought it for my husband and it fit perfectly. It is packaged nicely and is a good quality for the price.
5.0,"I've had this band since February.  It is extremely comfortable and so great to look at.  I have not had any problems with it coming apart on my wrist, very secure unlike some others I've tried.  Just ordered one for a friend who loved mine.  I waited to write review to make sure it would hold.  No rash like silicone. Really would recommend this to anyone."
5.0,It worked perfect for my Halloween costume for work.
5.0,Absolutely LOVED this dress.
5.0,They're really nice
5.0,Me fascinaron muy buena calidad quedan hermosos y cómodos estoy ansiosa por usarlos .me gustaría poder comprar más estilos como ese en plataforma se que me preguntarán dónde los compré ..gracias muy contenta con el producto
5.0,Really could not use it
5.0,Best gift for a ten year old
5.0,Nice weight. Nothing cheap and/or thin. Sizing is to be expected. Excellent sweat shirt.
5.0,"fits well, it was a Christmas present"
5.0,"I have multiple pairs now because these are my favorite shorts ever. I wear them doing yard work, swimming, paddling, shopping, they’re great for all activities."
5.0,"Love these hats, purchased multiple colors and have ordered more. Having long hair and being able to wear a pony tail and hat is a must in the summer, this hat helps to take the weight off my head from my hair and gives me a nice full looking pony tail.<br />Highly recommend these hats, they wash great too."
5.0,"These twill shirts are very nice classy shirts. If you dry them with just a small handful of clothes or like I do, by themselves, they dry in minutes. Take them out and hang them, they really need no ironing. Great shirts. Fantastic variety of colors. Sizes are all true to life sizing. I own about every color. I'm 6 foot, 195, muscular, and wear a 16.5 34/35 or Large.. depending on which page you see these on.. but the poplin twill are the best looking and easiest to maintain, and no iron. Great for summer."
5.0,The material is excellent but I could of went a size smaller because it stretches
5.0,I love these as casual pants since I can’t stand wearing jeans anymore. Great length. I am 5’2 and it stops right above my ankle.
5.0,Matches my Rolex submarine pefect
5.0,My wife loved this bag as a Valentine's Day gift.  Neat pattern.
5.0,GREAT COLORS THE DRIVE IN AND THE CARS.<br />VERY COLORFUL
5.0,"Backstory and how we found Freshly Picked-<br /><br />I am a busy mom to two active boys. When my second little one was born he was perfect! But his pediatrician couldn't help notice his feet. His toe nails were ingrown, badly. His pediatrician have him 7 months to grow them or a referral to the podiatrist would be needed. Time is out and a visit to the foot doc is made. I wont be going into detail about this, he will need surgery to correct his nails and other issues. But in the meantime his doctor recommend Freshly Picked!<br />I was a newbie to this brand and moccasins in general and a bit of a steep for baby shoes had me skeptical. But doctor recommendations should be put to the side so I gave them a try.<br />His first pair came around and he took them for a crawl. I was surprised they stayed on his chubby cute feet perfectly without slipping off. Fist pair was Ants. So cute. I was hooked. Not only my baby was moving perfectly, he wasnt complaining about his feet he started walking but only when he had his moccs on. So another pair followed and another and another. We are now full of Freshly Picked. Even my older son wears FP with their next step shoes. Which are adorable and durable for a preschooler. So worth the money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />•They stay on baby's feet<br />•Doctor recommend<br />•Soft so they dont create obstruction on natural foot movement when learning to walk<br />•soft and durable, they rub off from the bottom leaving a perfect footprint of baby's foot, cute for keepsakes<br />•colors for all outfits and neutrals too<br />• the next steps are amazing, preschooler approved!<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Measure your baby's foot, some moccs run a bit smaller / bigger then advertised. Which is normal for hand made feet. My baby measures at around 4 1.4 inches and wears a 3 but will be moving to a 4 when he hits a hit over 4.5 inches.<br />•the next step seem to measure small to try on well and size up if possible.<br /><br />I recommend FreshlyPicked to my friend and whoever comments on his &quot;cute moccasins&quot; which happens alot! I have convinced many of my mom friends to try them out, great results! They are hooked!<br /><br />They make great new baby presents as well!"
5.0,The fit of the dress was perfect
5.0,Love them so much!!
5.0,Perfect Mask...3rd time ordering this style from CC 😉👍
5.0,"Excellent pajamas,  great quality, fast shipping!"
5.0,Watch face is small but looks sleek.
5.0,"Bought the mask for my daughter to take to school,it fits perfectly she loved it!"
5.0,Great pattern for a lawyer
5.0,I bought this for my nephew for his birthday and he loves it.  He has had many compliments on it asking where he got it.  Thank-you Amazon for offering this on your site.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:bff1eaa57e7ef976743c8bc2a20be6da]] I love my new Bracelet.
5.0,"Fits true to size, really comfortable, love the pockets in the shorts!"
5.0,I’m really happy I bought this.  I saw it on another site and loved it. Then I found it here.  It was everything I expected it to be.  No clasp issues or ugly stones.
5.0,"I ordered these as a gift for my daughter in law, and she gave rave reviews to me about how well she liked them."
5.0,"Never heard of puncture earrings.  I figured the earrings in the picture are cute!<br />Basically, they are earrings where the backing and front piece both have designs on them<br />which cause the effect of looking like it's 3d and jumping at you.  So cute.  Almost like<br />having gauges without having them!<br /><br />My earrings took about a month to get to me.  They look exactly how they do in the<br />pic and are about the length of three fingertips.  Nice size.  Love these!<br />Also, the company was very sweet!  They constantly emailed me to make sure<br />my product was coming or to see if I got it yet and if I liked the quality!<br />5 stars alone just for the respectful customer/merchant relationship."
5.0,These glasses got me laid Friday night...buy em!
5.0,Super cute choker. Fits just right and I love the double straps.
5.0,As described. Great utility work glove.
5.0,"Bought these for my daughter mostly, but there were a couple I wanted to try myself. They are very nice quality and super cute! My daughter has already worn two of them. For the price and quality these cannot be beat!!"
5.0,So so so pretty.
5.0,Nice quality set.
5.0,"Really cute touch to any outfit! The chains are a little smaller than I expected, but cute nonetheless! Not too heavy, but not super light to the point it feels like dainty jewelry. 100% would recommend!"
5.0,Works beautifully I'll never buy collar stays again!
5.0,Fast shipping true to size wonderful seller !!!
5.0,Very cute!! It looks sexy on my hand!!! I got a lot of compliments!!
5.0,It was for my mother and it fitted her wonderful and I will be buying more of the Marc Ecko sweaters soon I hope before Christmas.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my dad and he loved it!
5.0,"Bought these from my birthday dinner and they were great! I wish the earring was flat on the part that touches your ear, instead of round, but that’s minor"
5.0,This is a beautiful dress that is super flattering.  The only caution I would add is that it is much lower cut than it looks in the pictures - you will need to wear a cami or tank underneath unless you want to show a LOT of cleavage.  The dress is gorgeous and well made though!
5.0,"very nice product, just did not fit my small frame."
5.0,Great addition to my wardrobe.  Thanks!
5.0,My teddy bear hasn't complained.
5.0,my gf said that i look like a bee but everyone loves bees...or should love bees... so it's a yes from me. stylish as hek (refer to picture) n it encapsulates a bit more than just the eye socket outline but not obnoxiously.  lens color can only be described as piercing. good quality n the frames are sturdy.
5.0,Perfect workout shirt!
5.0,"I love this dress but wasn’t sure about sizing. I’m 5”6 and 140, 32B. The medium fit great."
5.0,"Best workout tank I’ve bought to date. Extremely breathable, fit well and looks good!"
5.0,"In looooove, I'm wearing it for prom and I couldn't be more excited!"
5.0,Sits low on the waist
5.0,So cute - So perfect!
5.0,so very comfy to wear
5.0,I have one of these shirts .  I got it 1 size larger than normal and it fits great.  The body doesn't hug too tight like some other shirts I've bought elsewhere.  It really is a great shirt for the price.
5.0,These are very pretty. Remind me of something you would find at anthropologie. The ladybug is a different touch and good luck! They have a back but they're not really necessary. Light and non irritating
5.0,Beautiful dress! I love everything about this dress. I received so many compliments and the picture didn’t do any justice. I will order other colors.
5.0,I hike 2-3 times per week and managed to sprain my ankle coming down off of a mountain one evening. It put a kink in my plans until I found this brace. The support is phenomenal if you get the correct size. My ankle feels nice and secure as I have slowly gotten back into my usual hiking schedule.
5.0,"This set is adorable, super soft, and very comfortable. Nothing like being able to look a little cute/sexy for your partner and be comfortable. I always fall between sizes and opted for the large for a slightly relaxed fit. The material has some give so a medium would have worked as well. Just depends on the fit you want.  Straps are adjustable too!"
5.0,"This is a very thin scarf, just a heads up. It looks exactly as presented, but like I said, a little bit thin."
5.0,So nice needed something that would fit on a plane as personal item and this was great!
5.0,Love these!! My phone fits perfect in pocket. Nice material too!
5.0,"These are really great socks! So soft and cushioned, and just the right compression, very comfortable"
5.0,"Bought for boyfriends Halloween costume, but I still wear it all the time. Very comfy!"
5.0,The cutest little cosmetic bag! The bag is made very well and strong. The material is very nice and you can wipe it off if it gets dirty. The print and colors are very pretty & vivid. I love that they put scripture inside of the bag which is a nice touch and very inspirational. I'm definitely ordering another one. Please make more items and sizes!
5.0,The only size that fits my face.  Great size for larger faces
5.0,"It's beautiful, confortable, fit as expected, i love it"
5.0,"This key chain does just what I wanted to accomplish. Most of my keys are on the rings of this key chain. The 2 keys I use the most often (car & house) are each on a separate ring cinnected to the key chain in the end that ""opens."" This allows me to easily remove a key so that I don't have to carry all at once, i.e. when I go in to work I take just the car key."
5.0,"I bought this dress to have something cool and comfortable to work from home in. It's exactly what I wanted! Soft and comfortable, cute print, and it has pockets! I usually wear a size 20, and since I've been somewhat inactive during lockdown, I ordered a 3X. The 3X was a little roomy, but still looks way cute. If they restock sizes, I will probably order more in a 2X. I love this dress!"
5.0,I can ONLY wear Vionic/Orthaheel.  I'm glad there's starting to be a wide selection in their flip flops & sandals because I have a couple other foot issues in addition to Plantar Fasciitis and most shoes with a back or enclosed toe shoes are torture for me.
5.0,Bigger than I thought it was. Very nice over night or travel bag roomy live the look
5.0,Excellent wallet.
5.0,My 10yr old son loves this robe to put on after his shower.  We bought up a size to ensure he can wear it even if he grows some.
5.0,Amazing my feet after a 12hr shift feels great!
5.0,This was a great inexpensive dress for the summer.
5.0,Love this! It tells everyone I love DA and it looks and feels good! What more can a gamer ask for?
5.0,"The shoes are beautiful but unfortunately they were too small. I typically wear a 10.5 and ordered the 10 since size 11 shoes are a no go for me leaving too much room. I wish they had half sizes so I could have a pair for myself. Overall the shoes were really nice and would go well with pants, skirts or dresses."
5.0,This shirt met all my expectations.  A good shirt at a great price.
5.0,Works good. Doesn’t fog glasses
5.0,"Great fabric, nice feel. Would buy more, in different colors."
5.0,Excellent book
5.0,Love the color and it's so soft to the touch.
5.0,Love this sleeper! It fit perfectly and my husband adored her in it.
5.0,"Very cute and convincing. Quite decent quality for the price. You’ll need to trim a few loose threads around the red bows and lace appliqués, but that’s no big deal. I also recommend steaming out the wrinkles in both layers of the skirt. I wore a short petticoat underneath for extra fluff. Very beautiful, got a lot of compliments. Umbrella and boots purchased separately."
5.0,Ordered as a Christmas gift.
5.0,"Bought the belt for use by a Boy Scout on scout campouts.  Have had it for over a year and 10 campouts.  Heavy duty, solid, wears well - great purchase for the price.  Looks official for scouting events."
5.0,Perfect !!
5.0,"More than a year after I purchased these sunglasses, I still have them... and they've been abused. I'd recommend them. Great for hikes and some sports, they're very light and almost unnoticeable."
5.0,Read the reviews and took advice to order true to size. Fits well. Very sexy
5.0,"Well mad, sturdy and stylish straw hat. The first thing I noticed is how sturdy this hat is.  Turned a few heads with this."
5.0,Lenses are crystal clear<br />Like the color and especially outdoor wear gives tremendous<br />Variations.Reasonable price
5.0,Got these for bridal shower and wedding activities and they're just what I needed. Pretty and soft!
5.0,this is incredibly well made and really sharp looking. I have had tons of compliments.
5.0,"Perfect for a mom! Fits my phone, money, cards, and lipgloss. I use it to toss in the diaperbag or just to run in the store."
5.0,"Works well, it gets really cold.  I just need to remember to use it more often."
5.0,This was perfect for a Thing 1 costume and so much cuter than a wig!!!
5.0,I bought this set for a wedding and it was so much prettier in person. I recommend this to anyone that wants a simple statement piece.
5.0,"Bought this and it came with a loud motor but the company offered to fix the problem! They have amazing customer service! Their product (watch winder) is great and keeps my watched wound with the correct time. It is beautiful and works as advertised. The extra compartment comes in handy too which is great!<br /><br />Overall, super satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,"I love this suit! I have a long torso and it fits very well on me. The little skirt is definitely shorter in the back and doesn't cover up my rear end... but that works for me, because my &#34;problem&#34; areas are in the front."
5.0,High fives all around! Merica!
5.0,"Better then expected! Real wood, great quality, look shape and amazing dark lenses. My husband was very impressed!"

5.0,"I wish they had more colors of this shirt in my size, I'd buy a shirt in each color"
5.0,"It's a cheap strap, it's comfortable and your guitar doesn't fall off. Perfecto.<br />I could do without the little pick pocket thing, I'd prefer to have no emblem, and it seems like the picks are always falling out when I take the guitar off."
5.0,Great capacity. Strong straps. Multiple pockets and division options. Annoying initial packaging.
5.0,I LOVE these boots. I get compliments everywhere I go!!! Very fashionable
5.0,"I love a house shoe. I love a memory foam, hard-bottom house shoe. These are super comfortable with bare feet or socks, and they're holding up after months of use. Definitely would buy again!"
5.0,these are absolutely amazing for the price...no slippage and once screwed remain tightly in place...the material doesn't appear of the kind that will tarnish but time will tell....
5.0,My husband really loves the Army hat that I got him.
5.0,Sooo beautiful and great quality but because of A storm it took almost a week after 2day shipping.
5.0,"My wife loves her Monogram necklace.  I can't verify it's gold quality other than the appearance and feel seems authentic. Very classy looking, well machined and she's consistently getting complements on it.  The 1.2&#34; was the perfect size and the 18&#34; chain keeps it just above her neckline of her shirts.  Highly recommend"
5.0,I exercise outside a lot and this allows me to take my mask with me and easily take it off and put it on as needed.  They have two options for attaching it to the mask which I liked.  It's attractive and durable.
5.0,Great quality and price
5.0,Gorgeous and true to size
5.0,"It's very beautiful, many ppl asked me where I buy my dress :)<br />I'm 40 yrs old, I'm 5.8"" and 180 pounds<br />XL was perfect for me..."
5.0,Very cute.  Look good.
5.0,Awesome great fit
5.0,"Great product, my daughter loves it!"
5.0,The swimsuit looks and fits great!
5.0,"I srsly love these socks.  I am a sock lover and where them all the time, I dont do shoes.<br />So if a pair lasts more than a month, it get great reviews from me.<br />I have 7 pr now and love them."
5.0,Gave as a gift and she loved it.
5.0,I love this product because it is lightweight and very comfortable. Very breathable and soft.

5.0,I gave it as a gift and the person hasn't stopped wearing it.<br />All good.
5.0,"Fits well and material is quality made. I thought it would have had more of a scooped, rounded bottom but it’s just the same length all around."
5.0,"So perfect, I bought another one!"
5.0,Awesome look and feel. The fabric is breathable and not at all irritating. My GF liked how the back of the tank is cut.
5.0,"3rd one I've bought, and I will probably buy more as needed.  I'm 215, 5'11&#34; and the large fits perfectly:  Not too tight, nice and roomy."
5.0,Excellent ponchos. Saved us when our Florida vacation became super rainy. The hoods have drawstrings and the end of the arms are stretchy so it keeps the water from getting your sleeve wet.
5.0,So cute! Well made - my daughter loves it!
5.0,"I liked most was the feel, kangaroo-pouch, & the tag; easy to remove. I liked least was expecting a 4-pack (per description), yet the picture indicated the 3-pack received. No big deal; I ordered larger than expected & it was needed."
5.0,"As many others have said, in the past I've had issues ordering clothing that run in asian sizes. However I took everyone's advice and sized up, and in return the dress that came was completely perfect. It is flowing and doesn't cling to my body (something that is a personal pet peeve of mine). The material is surprisingly nice, and I believe when the summer comes it will be very nice to wear on hot days. Somehow despite being loose in shape, my figure looks great and it doesn't entirely my form. Overall an unexpected surprise, will be ordering from this company again."
5.0,"Just ordered this yesterday as a Christmas gift. The package arrived today. For $8.99, I was not expecting to be amazed at the excellent quality of the crystal and the light.<br />In fact for 8.99, I was not even expecting the light to work as the picture said. Well, this is a fantastic beautful gift. The colors are great and show off the beautiful crystal. Amazing and great value."
5.0,Very comfortable and great support. I own several pairs of hey dudes which I love but I think I loving these more now. Looking to buy more now
5.0,The material feels like a scrubs diving suit but it fits great and is very very cute.
5.0,Great for thin mask.  It is breathable.  That’s what I wanted.
5.0,This is a very comfortable bra. It has great support and I like the extra coverage so it feels like your wearing a tank top instead of a bra.
5.0,Just the way it normally is
5.0,Pretty awesome for the price! Is stainless and hasn't turned as of yet. I like the size. It's big and bulky which is what I was looking for.
5.0,"this took a while to ship from China but the seller provided tracking and I could see it every step of the way. This ring is gorgeous! Fits a little loose (6.5) but not bad, really a very pretty ring. Well made too!"
5.0,Very nice.....purchased for my toddler but I'm wearing them tooooo cute! Packaged well and clear instructions with easy return if need....very professional
5.0,"The XLT size provided a nice trim fit for a guy who is tall and in shape (most XLT's seem to be cut for guys with a big beer belly).  The material is lightweight, cool, comfortable and stays nearly odor free."
5.0,"I love this dress because it's so beautiful and comfortable. I can also dress it up or down, or it casual wear. Or it can be evening wear."
5.0,the shirt i bought is a great fit . the design is vivid and powerful.a real eye cather for sure!!!!
5.0,"So far so good. Super cute, seems like good quality, and it keeps my little dry."
5.0,"This shirt looked exactly like the picture and fit similarly to the model. The quality of the fabric is great and looks like you bought it at a Macy’s store. The material feels very soft and is something you would wear in the summer. The only thing wrong with it is that, my bra lines and curves were more visible on the back of the shirt since I prefer these to be unseen. A cami might fix this problem."
5.0,Loved the material so soft
5.0,"It's great. Doesn't come with any filters, but you can cut your own filters and place them on the sides (2 large circles), and in the front (2 small circles). Fits well. Smells a bit like chemicals, but you can get the smell out with disinfectant."
5.0,The ease of use - looks great
5.0,This dress is so comfortable and perfect for lots of occasions. I wore to an end-of-summer party and felt great. It wasn't as fitted as I expected so I should have ordered one size down so it was a little more fitted.
5.0,Love them. They are so soft. They fit perfectly. They move with me when I am in yoga class. Plus... Pockets! I bought 5 pair! So awesome!
5.0,Such a beautiful set! My daughter is going to love these!
5.0,"These casual pants fits me perfectly.  I received a size Medium, which is my usual size in pants.  I am 5’3” and 120 pounds.  I will say it is meant to be slightly baggy around the buttocks area.  The waist has a 1.5 inch wide elastic band and sits at true waist.  It doesn’t feel restrictive.  There is a drawstring at the waist, also.  Since I’m only 5’3”, the length of the pants is perfect for me.  The measurements for Medium in the description matches what I’m measuring.  I like that the material is comfortable, and the two front pockets are perfect for carrying a smartphone.  Phones always slip out with side pockets, so these are better.  The pants is comfortable to move around in such as sitting down or walking.  These are great, because they are pull-on pants.  The material is 97% cotton, so I would wash in cold water.  These pants are perfect for shopping and travel."
5.0,Worthwhile purchase. Very forgiving hinge that works with your face shape. The wood frame is striking and comfortable.
5.0,It is a perfect cuff bracelet and looks fabulous on.
5.0,It arrived in a week.  It fits beautifully. perfect!

5.0,My 10yo loves it! Glad it adjusts to different sizes. So cute & fun
5.0,I like this band because it is lighter than others I have tried and the price is great. It is easy to use the clasp. The only thing frustrating is with the white band can’t be cleaned when it gets dirty.
5.0,Very cute light weight nice bright tree green color as shown.
5.0,"This dress is so amazing! it definitely has the texture of a halloween costume but it fits beautifully and is perfect for wearing down to the beach! the leg slit is a little off, so i have to turn the dress a bit, but it’s great for the price!"
5.0,"Legit 14KT gold , very good quality! Love it!"

5.0,Just love it completely. Looks unique and expensive.
5.0,"I like this purse.  It's  a little smaller that I thought, but it has lots of pockets to keep things organized.  Love the front pocket/wallet to keep my cards organized without having to carry a bulky wallet.  Love the camel  color too. It goes with everything"
5.0,Masks are nice for the price.

It’s very sturdy and light weight at the same time. I would absolutely purchase this again. Get it before they’re out of stock!!
5.0,"I was a little skeptical since there were no reviews on this product, but I made the right decision. I ordered these for my ushers at my wedding, and the color is a perfect royal blue - very vibrant. The fabric is nice and smooth, with a subtle shine to it. They even came in nice black gift boxes.  I would definitely recommend this tie."
5.0,These are my favorite style of flat boots.. i buy again and again!
5.0,Love this purse. Plenty of room in it. Like the 3 outside zip pockets. The biggest outside zip pocket is perfect for a cell phone. The 2 separate compartments let me put my most used items separate from other things so I don't  have to search for them. It is very pretty. I think the price was fantastic. I am very happy with my purchase. They have a great selection. I will not hesitate to buy my next purse from Scarleton. Their purses are very nice looking and well made.
5.0,Very comfy and fits well. Want to see how it launders! I hope well
5.0,"I fell in love with it the mi ute it got here. It's my main lanyard, and even added DC universe buttons!"

5.0,Great case. Looks good and is very nice. Hard so it will protect my glasses in my backpack which is great.

5.0,it a nice top love the fabric

5.0,"I've worn this three times and it always gets me compliments.  Very cool, comfortable and flattering.  Easy to care for.  Going to get a few more:)"
5.0,"I really did like this dress, however I ordered a size too small.  I think even the correct size would be too short and too short waisted for me.  The fabric was wonderful, although heavier than I could wear comfortably in Arizona summers.  I am returning it."
5.0,The girls loved them.  Highly recommend.
5.0,I love this product because I love marvel superheroes and I was able to use them on my crocs and they look very good.

5.0,This is the best product ever!
5.0,My daughter loves this scarf - these are very difficult to find in clothing stores - Amazon came through after months of shopping without success
5.0,"I completely love this! I had another baja jacket bought in Mexico and this one is just as nice and warm. The size is accurate, too, if not a smidge larger. Great colors and feels so good! I completely recommend."
5.0,Love it very comfortable
5.0,"I'm 5'6&#34;, 160, and I ordered a large. I have a little tummy, and sometimes this style of dress makes me look pregnant. The cut of this dress is extremely flattering. LOVE it."
5.0,"More of a fleece than a jacket....absolutely love it though. Looks like a rough fabric, but its actually quite soft and fuzzy. Fairly stain resistant I must add....spilled a zinfandel on the sleeve and didn't notice immediately, thought it ruined, but cold water and a wash brought it out! Like it so much I found a 1/2 zip model and got that too!"
5.0,"This dress is hands down adorable ladies you will love it . I’m 5”2 170 lbs 36DD and I have a hard time because I have small waist Big hips, small ribs big breast so if you have that shape this is perfect! I ordered a medium"

5.0,"I love this blouse fits nice, and is flattering to the body, I like a blouse to hide my middle where I carry my weight, which this blouse does. Thanks!"
5.0,This set is so soft and fluffy. I expected it to come in a huge box like usual but this came in an envelope inside of a vacuumed shrink wrap.
5.0,Fits just a tad bit small but not by much
5.0,"Very nice, my mother loved it!"
5.0,"I love this clutch,its got good quality to it.very nice."
5.0,Gift<br />I
5.0,"Soft and cozy. Excellent fit. Can't say if it's ""true to size"" because I'm not sure of the size. This was sent as a gift. Love it though"
5.0,looks great on my panerai
5.0,This is easily my favorite dress that I have bought off Amazon. It came quickly and my daughter loves it. We did end up pairing it with a white cardigan so she could wear it to church and we got tons of compliments.  *note: you will need to steam the dress since the tulle will be wrinkled from shipping.
5.0,Loved it!  Fits perfectly.
5.0,"I bought these for my wife and she gets compliments on them all the time. She wears them pretty much every day and so far, they've held up well. She was surprised that the lace was so sturdy. Despite going through the washing machine and her walking 1-2 miles every day, the seams of the socks wore out before the lace did. We would definitely order more."
5.0,"Received on time, decent quality for the price."
5.0,I like the portability of this bag big enough for my 9.7 inch iPad with a thick rubber case on it nice room with the back pocket and the front pockets. Love the print on it too I kinda wish this was waterproof but I cant hopefully fixed that problem myself
5.0,"Meets all my front pocket wallet needs... the bare essentials and then some and the cool factor... big plus.  A little pricey, but worth it."
5.0,"I LOVE this shirt and I have worn it all summer. The color is great, fits true to size and has washed well (I hang it dry to make sure it doesn't shrink).  I've gotten a lot of compliments when I wear it too."
5.0,"I love these leggings and have multiple! This color way seems to be the thinnest but not see through. The waist band is super thick and compressive which I love, and overall my favorite leggings!<br />Size M<br />Jean size: 6-8<br />(If you typically wear medium in bottoms, get medium it’s still really compressive)"
5.0,"I bought three of these in different colors not knowing what to expect. I am on a weight loss journey so I figured if I was out a few bucks it wasn't so bad. These are really cute on. They drape where they are supposed to and that little flash of silver brings some fun to them. I was and hang dry, but I  would recommend these t shirts"
5.0,My son in law was very happy with it.
5.0,This has become one of my go-to tops for work.  It goes with any style bottom and it always looks professional.  It looks great after several washes.  I might buy another in another color.  Great top.
5.0,Love this dress. Comfortable & sexy while being classy at the same time.
5.0,Very cute. Fits my watch perfectly. I love the blue one. Nice combination or colors.

5.0,I love it. Worth the price
5.0,"I wanted a product to keep my shirt from sticking to my skin when I sweat and as a light weight insulator in the cold. Other products were fashion statements, I wanted something practical. This was the only product that I could find that was what I wanted.  I will not wear this as an external garment."
5.0,"Just arrived and I tried it on. It fits me well,not tight and not loose.For a men's L . I had thought it might be too big for me but it isn't. I'm 5'6 and around 180 but look thinner.Slightly curvy,althetically built, medium frame body,But with some mucsle I am happy with my purchase.Love the color and thumb holes too !! It's not too thin and not thick. Perfect for spring and summer.It also has a media pocket inside for a thin music player and hole for your earphones. That was a plus. Love it.Iys my favorite hoodie.<br /> It does leave a little lint on your shirt,but,it's not a lot."
5.0,"I bought this for a onesie Halloween costume as a joke but have quickly started to love it. It is very soft and great for sleeping in. Everyone loved it and wanted to buy their own. It is a bit baggy in the crotch area, but I think that added to the hilarity of it. It’s good quality, feels good, and is a real show stopper"
5.0,"Our granddaughter love these pants, and I am happy with the quality."
5.0,Beautiful necklace. The quality is good.
5.0,"I loved these out of the box. Now it's been a year, and I still love them. Not all silk knot links are of this quality; I had a (more expensive) pair from J Crew that unravelled within six months (though, to J Crew's credit, they did refund my money)."
5.0,"Fits a lil too loose but I do not mind, love the shirt."
5.0,"Good design, high quality. They are big. Would like these in 22&#34;"
5.0,"Looks good, taste great, and less filling.makes a good  looking guy look even better."
5.0,It's beautiful!!  Just what I have been looking for.  Very nice packaging.
5.0,"I bought this for my son’s swim lessons. Water resistant and fits a large towel and easily 3 more pairs of shorts and tees. There is still room to spare. Zippers at the sides are useful for creams, lotions etc."
5.0,"This sweatshirt was a little larger than expected,  but still fit my son. Sleeves were a bit long, we just rolled them up.  Love the material.  Soft, but still heavy enough to be warm.  Will work well for our chilly fall evenings."
5.0,Very comfortable. Got exactly what I expected based on description and the reviews of others.
5.0,Love how the socks stay in place.
5.0,These do run a little bit. I would size down.
5.0,These have now become my favorite leggings!! They fit perfect & I love the pockets! I ordered the navy & im going to order a pair in black now! These fit very well and are I love the higher waist and how slimming they are!
5.0,They are so shiny and really eye catching.
5.0,I used a piece of silk tape to cover the slick &#34;silver&#34; bottom & it works perfectly! thank you.
5.0,It’s a great navy color and love the extra tummy control…but it’s not too much. Very comfortable and runs true to size.
5.0,Totally the right size and function
5.0,I had to return I got the wrong size. My Dad loved them I going to replace the right size.
5.0,"I feel like I’m about to go whip up a magical meal in the kitchen, yet I work in the hospital. The hat gives off chef vibes but… it is functional, protects my hair, is very comfortable and has a nice set of buttons to protect my ears from mask fatigue. I will continue to be the best chef nurse in the ICU 🤣🤣🤣"
5.0,"Great summer dress! Good for work (might be a little too short for the dress code, if you have one). This dress is feminine and very flattering. It shows the girls pretty well, the band around to waist is not tight at all, flowy and flirty! A must have for summer"
5.0,This sweater is just like what you see in Irish shops And you don’t have to lug it back from ireland
5.0,These pants are perfect for me when I go to the gym .
5.0,Love these! So cute in person.
5.0,"The dark green is a lovely color. The dress is adorable, fits me well, it is comfortable and does not look cheap. My measurements were on the border of the size up, but since the fabric stretches, the smaller size fit me perfect. I wanted to look sexy but elegant, and this style was perfect. I ordered the design that has the plain flared skirt because the lace sleeves were long enough to disguise my chubby arms. I have a 40-inch bust size, but the medium fits nicely since the lace is a stretchy fabric."
5.0,Great gift came earlyer then dated thank you
5.0,"Very soft and silky feeling. I tried various ways of styling in my hair and it kept slipping out, but around my neck looks cute too. Got lots of compliments on it!! Very good quality for the low price."
5.0,Great service and quality product!
5.0,"Bad ass bandana, Came in the mail fast and came with a dope sticker"
5.0,Very soft and adorable robe.  I bought it for my grand daughter. She loved it. Was super excited her doll got a robe to match.
5.0,I love them and the are so light
5.0,"Fits great and very comfortable, not too heavy on the face"
5.0,"This pullover is very comfortable & it’s also a loose design. He will be wearing it exclusively for golf, to this works for movement!<br />[SIZE REFERENCE]:<br />He’s 6’0”, 172 lbs, & prefers his tops fitted for casual or dress so wears Medium & more loose for sportswear so goes with Large. I ordered this in a Large & you can see the fit in the photo - it’s generous in the torso & the sleeves are plenty long as well. This works for golfing in!<br /><br />The white zippers pop on the Corn Husk Blue color & the collar is designed well to stand up or lay nicely, depending on how far you zip it.<br />Since it’s 90% cotton (+ 10% Tencel), it may shrink or tighten up a bit which will be fine for him.<br />Bottom line? Classic design + well made + generous fit = recommend!<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this & I hope that it’s Helpful!** 😊"
5.0,Very stylish with a great fit. I get many completely on these MCM frames.
5.0,These are exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful yet functional.
5.0,"nice color, good compression and easy to put on"
5.0,"A comfortable night dress, my favorite."
5.0,We ordered one of these for both of our kids and they love it!  Other brands we had found seemed to be too long and bunch up too much or were way too big to be labeled as a kids size
5.0,Simply beautiful...
5.0,Love the smocked top and flowy bottom
5.0,"As a southern belle, I LOVE camouflage! I've been wanting some camo leggings for a while, and I'm so happy that I found these. They are so comfortable and soft, and I almost forget I am even wearing them. As a 5' 8&#34; and 121 pound girl, I was a little nervous about how they would fit me, but they fit perfectly! I love that the top of the leggings can stretch over my belly a little to help give my post-baby tummy a slightly flatter appearance. These leggings are perfect to dress up and be cute in, or to just be casual and relaxed in. The material is perfect for all year long, it's warm enough for the winter, but light enough for the summer time. I'm also very impressed with the quality of the camo print on these leggings. A must have for any camo loving girl!"
5.0,Love  the color. I had ordered the light pink. It was as described. The shirt fit true to size for me.  Awesome  product and will not hesitate to order again from company.
5.0,"Fits perfect , I ordered an xs and I’m 5ft2 120 lbs, chest 36 b if that helps, looks and fits just like the picture"
5.0,"Love this t-shirt!!! It fits perfectly, extremely comfortable, and you can't beat the price!! I'm very happy with the fact that it isn't see through! It seems like every soft lightweight material nowadays is also see through, but not this t-shirt. My new fave. Will buy more."
5.0,"excelent ,my son loved"
5.0,"I'm tall and a plus size (1x) and was able to knot it above my bust. The length is good (below the knee). Has a nice &#34;hand&#34;. I have been looking and looking and LOOKING! for a plus size button front terry cloth (50's style with pockets) swimsuit coverup to no avail. Not a fan of flimsy see-thru coverups (though I own a couple), or using a towel, or my husbands t-shirt. Then I saw a woman wearing one over her suit and thought &#34;What a great idea!&#34;. I don't know why it never occurred to me to do this before. Duh. I ordered the Black'nWhite Palm Leaf pattern, and it goes with the black in my bathing suit pattern (not matchy matchy). It washed well in a large lingerie bag in lukewarm water in the washer, and I put it in the dryer for 5 minutes (literally) with other dark clothing to tumble out any wrinkles, and then hung it to dry the rest of the way. Came out perfect. Looks exactly like it did straight out of the package, and now with no manufacturing odor. I am going to order a couple more from this company in different patterns/colors. Very happy with purchase. It does come with a coconut shell buckle, but I prefer not to use it."
5.0,I like it style.

5.0,These are the most comfortable industrial barbell ear rings I have ever worn! At first when I seen these I was like idk how these will work or feel but once I got it....I was completely amazed on how comfortable these are! I can't even tell that its in my ear! I will be buying more for sure!! My only complaint is need to make more ear rings like this with different designs...coz I have now found my favorite type of industrial bar to wear.
5.0,"This Bulova chronograph is a beautifully elegant and and understated watch; it is an instant heirloom. Bulova is a proud and century-old American brand that represents the absolute pinnacle of the watch-making art. Over fifty years ago I was presented as a graduation gift a Bulova stainless-steel 23-jewel self-winding watch. That watch, disregarding a few dings, remains as beautiful and functional now as it was then. As the mechanical watch is replaced by the quartz crystal watch as the mass-produced and popularly worn watch, the mechanical watch, characterized by this Bulova, moves into the province of the luxury watch. In a few weeks I will have the pleasure of presenting this Bulova as a gift to mark another graduation. Although I will not see it, I have every confidence that in fifty years hence this Bulova will replicate the performance of its 23-jewel predecessor."

5.0,They fit well and are very comfortable.
5.0,"This romper is SO cute and better quality than I expected. I am a size 16-18 and ordered a 2XL. I was SO sad when it was just a bit too snug. Actually, at 5'5&#34;, I was even more surprised to find that the torso wasn't very long. Anyway, I wish they had a bigger size, because I would wear the crap out of this thing."
5.0,"I'm very pleased with this lightweight but warm for around-the-house shawl.  I don't like to wear sweaters and even though this is made with 100% acrylic, which is a sweater-like fabric to me, I really like this.  It's easy to drape around my shoulders and adjust unlike sweaters that seem to generate static electricity when I pull my arms through the sleeves.  The collar and front sides of this shawl have an attractive ribbing that keeps my neck warm - a bit like a scarf.  The fabric is limp so the collar does not stand up on its own.  The front around the neck/collar ribbing falls to a point on the chest.  I'm 5'3"" and on me, the bottom point of the neck/collar ribbing is about at my waist.  The front of this shawl also ends in vertical ribs on the bottom 5 inches which hang at a slant.  On me, the bottom points of the shawl on each side come to just below my knees.  The back of this shawl drops to about mid-thigh on me.  Besides wearing this as a basic shawl, it's easy to toss one of the front ends over a shoulder although perhaps best to clip some way to keep it in place.  I'm sure there are other ways to drape this shawl as desired.  The instructions state that this shawl is hand washed in cold water and then laid flat to dry.  Because it's lightweight, I suspect that it's easy for the fabric to snag. It's a nice color that goes with anything.  My rating is 5 stars for this versatile cozy shawl."
5.0,A simple bonding gift to my girlfriend. Quick shipping and reasonable price!
5.0,"I loved this beanie! The detachable fluffball is awesome and so stylish, cant wait to get another one in a different color!"
5.0,"My daughter oozed over this dress from the moment she saw it.  She was very excited about how pretty it is and can't wait to wear it out.  To her, it is really special."
5.0,These shoelaces are so great and a lifesaver! These laces have helped my preschooler share in the morning routine by being able to put his own shoes on. They are great hybrid as we are learning how to tie our shoe laces. We own 4 pairs and would buy again! My only con is that they are slightly difficult to remove compared to standard laces but this is not a deterrent.
5.0,"This garment was beautiful and so, so soft. The styling was just what I was looking for. BUT, it was way too big. I’m 5’2” and 100 lbs and ordered the “Small”. It really fit me like a medium/large. It was just too big. They didn’t have an “XS” but they didn’t have any. I’m still looking."
5.0,"Love all of them. Great colors, patterns. Don’t slip when I’m working or moving my goggles on or off!"

5.0,Excellent product; Excellent Seller; Great Price!
5.0,"I purchased this jacket through Amazon marketplace using a gift card to off set the price. I love Fjallraven rugged quality jackets. This one was no exception. I am not easy on my jackets, and since I am always cold, I wear them practically all day long! I have quickly worn out jackets/parkas from other brands, but Fjallraven.<br /><br />This jacket fits me closer to a mid-thigh length parka, but at 5 feet tall, I am used to it. I went for a size larger than some of my usual Fjallraven size of a small (their jackets already is sized in a way to accommodate for possible layering), because I may want to layer it over thicker clothing during the colder days/months and have more room in the shoulders (which mine are broad). However, after trying on the jacket, I shouldn’t have worried, and should have kept with my usual size of small instead of buying the medium.<br /><br />One of the biggest reasons why I purchased this jacket was the fact it had so many pockets! Since Covid, I have completely minimized the amount of things I need to carry with me on a daily basis, and put them in my pockets as you can wash jackets, but necessarily the leather and special materials on my purses. It is also great to go out hiking/walking around in the woods with a bag.<br /><br />The other reason I purchased this jacket was it’s incredible ruggedness, and that it will protect me from rain showers (to a point) and wind as it is water and wind resistant. I do have a bar of Fjallraven wax at home, and I know I can apply more layers of wax when needed…or get it done at the Fjallraven store for free. I am happy that this jacket is so solid that it can take hits and tugs from tree branches, sudden bursts of rain and wind, and rubs against trees/rocks/dirt/mud…all in stride. The color I purchased was a dark olive, which is very dark brown, and I love it. So many women’s jackets are in such bright colors (which I own my fair share of), it is nice to have something more “earthy” instead of the usual black or navy colors."
5.0,Is comfortable to wear and looks great
5.0,Gave this as a gift to my daughter. she loves it.  It is strong and not like most of these purses that hurt sometimes from straws. Very happy and she loves it.

5.0,"I bought the goggles for my husband and he loves it. Comfortable to wear, easy to adjust. Clear to see underwater, eyes are covered totally. The seller also notified me about their 30-days guaranty refund but we pretty much won't need it :-) I would recommend this product to family and friends!"
5.0,I returned it because I changed my mind about the color but it was an awesome vest.
5.0,"Based on their sizing I got a large, I typically wore a medium shirt before pregnancy, and it fit great from when I got it in the 2nd trimester till now due any day now. The material is very soft and stretchy. I bought a second one for my best friend who is also pregnant. We have completely opposite bodies. I'm 5'6 and pushing 200 after a 50lb weight gain, and she's 5'10 and maybe 140lbs now. I ordered her a medium and it fit her tall and slimmer frame well."
5.0,Love it!! Comfy and warm.
5.0,Perfect belt for people that don't like real wide belts. Also came with a leather punch to make additional holes if needed.

5.0,I buy at least one for my daughter every year - this is the third or fourth year I think.  Just know what you are buying.  These do not last the whole season. The seam between the tulle and the top rips every time. It's a play dress here at our house because my girl likes to be frilly and play in the dirt so the price is right!  Read the sizing info - it has been fairly accurate for us.
5.0,Put it on had no problems
5.0,"I love this hat so much. The material and quality of it is excellent and is great for any weather. I ordered this hat about 2-3 yrs ago and I still wear it to this day.

5.0,Great undershorts for wearing under a dress or even workout. Soft and very comfortable. Great<br />Customer Service w this seller as well. A+
5.0,"Even when the temperatures plummet my dogs expect to be walked for miles. A good pair of socks is imperative. These more than fit the bill. The merino wool is warm and soft. it wick moisture, keeping feet comfortable even when encased in heavy boots or hikers. They are very supportive and you can feel the compression not just on the foot but up the calves as well. they are knee high and stay up even during vigorous hiking. The gray and white pattern is interesting..The medium fits women's shoe sizes  7-10.5. with plenty of cushioning and compression, these socks are quickly becoming my favorites. Machine wash inside out on the gentle cycle in cold water and dry flat."
5.0,"These are really nice socks. When I first opened the shipping box, I was impressed with them immediately. 3 pairs of socks came in their own box, as if they were some designer item. Then once I actually took out the socks, they are very thick and luxurious feeling. The lil woman is using these nd says they feel as nice on the feet too. Super absorbent, support and padding where you need it.<br /><br />They are a nice length as well. Not too long, and not the bootie type socks that everyone seems to be into these days. They go good with her hiking/work boots, and she really loves them."
5.0,They are awesome!
5.0,easily fits and looks great
5.0,"My two year old is very picky about what she'll put on her feet.  I think the sparkliness appeals to her visually, and the comfort makes her want to keep them on."

5.0,"This ring fits well and feels great, heart beat looks great, very nice ring"
5.0,"Wow! I collect Seiko, Orient, and Citizen watches and I have to say that this is probably one of my top watches.

5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is the first nightgown I've bought like this (I usually just wear big t-shirts) and I'm completely in love. The fabric is super soft and the fit is both flowy and sexy. I love the high-low hem, and it comes just low enough to hide the goods. My boyfriend thinks it's incredibly sexy and is always asking where it is when I'm not wearing it. For reference, I am 5'5&#34;, about 130lbs, 38-29-40, and I bought a small."

5.0,It's a beautiful well made piece
5.0,Good quality hoops for my piercing
5.0,This show stretcher is much more than I expected.  The description said plastic so I thought it would be light and I'd have to be careful with it so as not to break it.  I was wrong.  This is a heavy duty shoe stretcher with good weight to it.  It is solid and works much better than the wood stretcher I used to have.  It's also much easier to use and the parts are of good quality.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.

5.0,Excellent service<br />Pretty item
5.0,"This dress is pretty, practical, and comfortable. The cross front design is perfect for nursing and pumping, though there was a little cleavage that I needed to cover with a slip for my work as a teacher. That said, this was a favorite… until I forgot to hang it to dry. Now there is SO MUCH cleavage showing. Like… so very much. All of it. I may try to rescue the dress with my sewing skills but am disappointed that it’s necessary."
5.0,"SUPER comfy, and if you're tall (I'm 5'11'') you can choose to not fold over the top so that it's longer/fits better."

5.0,"I like the boots very much, how they close, especially.  However, I wasn't sure of the size to order.  When I read the reviews, someone remarked that the boots run true to size.  So, I ordered my regular size.  They are way too small.  *** Oops!  Found I ordered the wrong size.  So, it was my fault.  Returning to get right size."
5.0,"I bought this as a gift and had it shipped to her directly.  I was a little worried about not seeing myself first but I read the reviews which were all good.

5.0,Used it for my fem kaneki cosplay. It's really good quality and made out of some sort of rubber. I don't particularly recommend for women or lin shaped faces since it has a large jaw.
5.0,"I love Yellow Box Flip Flops....they are so comfy....the sole is thicker than most flip flops which makes them wearable for many hours at a time....I also love the zebra print....and the thicker straps don't rub the top of your foot, which is nice too...:)"

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:73b77a09f303e1473e3aa46166e1200e]] This costume was exactly what I was looking for! It’s was an absolute HOOT! It was super easy to put on, it stayed inflated, and was comfortable to walk around in. FIVE STARS! 😂"
5.0,"I was surprised at how well this fit my daughter. We don't usually buy clothes online, but decided why not? We didn't realize the necklace was actually part of the dress which is a nice surprise. She's 5 foot 3 and normally wears a 2x, but went up a size to be sure and it fits just right. Its not too short at all and in fact is the perfect length. With and without shapewear it fit comfortably. The fabric is super soft and stretchy. I would suggest going up one size to be sure you're getting the best option for you. I'd buy it again."
5.0,"Perfect, colors are as shown. I have big head and a lot of hair, even snapbacks on the biggest size dont fit sometimes but this one exactly what i was looking for. Now if only i could find a fourstar snapback thats black with the skull and cross skateboards"
5.0,"Buy it for your daughter ! 100% satisfaction guarantee , so nice , so adorable , comfortable and true to size"
5.0,"Nicely made, fits well"
5.0,These earrings are stunning statement earrings! Loved these for my recent maternity photos on the beach
5.0,Just got this for my mom she loves it fits her it’s beautiful it’s everything like in the picture
5.0,"The fabric is really lightweight which I love. I have a little bit of a hard time trying to figure out putting it on each time, but it looks great once I succeed."
5.0,These are so adorable. I love them
5.0,my daughter loved it thanks for the great gift :)
5.0,"This hoodie is awesome. Very comfortable and a die hard KTM lovers ideal hoodie.<br /><br />Be advised that it is an extremely dark navy blue / borderline black. However, I did contact the seller who went above and beyond to contact the manufacturer and ended up finding out that it was in fact navy blue but that the manufacturer ended up getting a darker navy to put the printing on for this year of hoodie.<br /><br />I love it though. Again, the seller went above any beyond to take care of my questions/concerns. I commend MXATV  and recommend buying from them if you are going to buy an item. Christy reached out to me and explained that they desired to focus their attentions on the customer in their business."
5.0,"Perfect. It’s beautiful and the material feels really strong and durable. Not a huge ass bag but serves my purposes. Also has a handy inside pocket for pads, coins whatever. Ignore my iCool water and peasant ass coins, I’m Jamaican lol."
5.0,Took this on a 2 week trip-first to NYC then on to Paris. Would highly reccommend. Great for international travel.
5.0,very cute. looks just like picture.
5.0,These are so cute and fit my daughter just right. She really likes them. Great price !
5.0,LOVE them so much fun to mix and match. Wear as many as you want too at one time.
5.0,sturdy. hasnt ripped or anything. use regularly
5.0,I prefer another brand. Didn't like these.
5.0,"Super cute, comfortable, & durable!"
5.0,"Great product and it looks good on me, and you can't beat that price"
5.0,"Perfect fit, dark tint, there’s no complaints here. Lenses stay in place. Symbol on the side is great.arrived quickly!"
5.0,Love this tote! Easy to pack and carry in the plane. Cute also.
5.0,Beautiful fit!!!
5.0,"Well made, fits great, true to size."
5.0,Beautiful!  I was stunned to see the beauty of this piece. Made well and am going to enjoy wearing it.
5.0,It's one great looking watch.its also very heavy too great quality
5.0,Agradable
5.0,Super cute and perfect for a plain long dress to make it pop! Worth the money and just different so I like. Got 2 compliments the first time I wore it. Just get one!
5.0,Very soft material.  It is a thinner material than I expected but it does not take away from the product.  The pattern is printed all the way through.  It is delicate and feminine.  No strange smell detected as there can be with dyed fabric.  It arrived on time if not early.  It is packaged very nicely in two separate plastic bags the inner one having a slider 'zipper'.  I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased honest review.
5.0,"Fits very well, is identical to picture, great price, fits both males and females. Rave on!"
5.0,Beautiful elegant sold earrings. they are a tad bit heave but just a tad some might not notice the weight I love it and I believe you would also
5.0,Very comfortable and fits great.
5.0,"Very durable, yet thin and comfortable. Really nice on the feet especially when wearing a tighter fitting shoe. An actual no show sock, not a so called no show that still comes up out of the shoe."
5.0,Love!! Excellent quality!!
5.0,"I have this in both black and white.  I am normally a size 8 or M in tops, 34DD.  I ordered the black in large and the white in medium.  Both look good, but the black is a little too big in the shoulders, so I would say order your usual size.  They are lined, so the body is not see-through.  The lace detail is beautiful."
5.0,Fits just right...I read previous reviews to help pick the right size and the reviews help!
5.0,"Comfortable and fit perfect. It wasn’t skin tight, the way I like my shirts. Curvy women and I ordered a XL"
5.0,This was a gift for a friend and she loved them
5.0,I’ve recently lost over 20lbs and none of my dresses fit me anymore and I needed one for a baby shower I was invited to. I saw this one as I enjoy simple so I can accessorize freely and I am in love with how comfortable and light weight this dress is and the best part is I am able to nurse my baby in it! I just have to add if you are larger chested person I recommend sizing up.
5.0,"Super cute, almost like a jersey type material. Stretchy and silky. I thought the medium would be too small on me based on the measurements but I probably would have been fine because the large is a bit big on me (but let's be honest, it almost feels like its the size the character wears so I'm A OK with it). Definitely worth the purchase to add to my Haikyuu collection:)"
5.0,Grandson loves it.  Yup.  I'm a happy grandma.
5.0,I got this for my grandson and it was so soft and he was absolutely adorable!!
5.0,"Love, love, love! This headband looks exactly like the picture. My toddler loves it and it looks adorable on her. I bought this for family photos and I couldn't be happier with it!"
5.0,Gorgeous color and super high-quality.
5.0,"This apple watch band is so perfect, I bought the purple and will most likely buy other colors too. I have very small wrists and I have it hooked on the 4th tightest knot with plenty of room to grow/ make is loser."
5.0,I really loved this product is of very good quality.<br />I really loved this product is of very good quality.
5.0,"My dad loved it, I got him a motorcycle for father’s day and put the key on it!"
5.0,"Just in time for summer ... No, not really.  It's shorts season now.  But these jeans will get an occasional wearing until this fall & cooler weather, when I'll be wearing them a lot.<br /><br />Normally I like slim fit jeans (not &#34;skinny&#34;).  But sometimes a relaxed fit feels good too.  These jeans are the perfect color (light blue / faded), the perfect softness, the perfect relaxed fit.  I like them a lot.<br /><br />Whenever I'm in the store and see $150+ pairs of men's jeans, I think, &#34;Really?  No way.&#34;  I don't mind spending plenty on special clothing -- but jeans aren't THAT special, really.  At least not for me.  So these affordable (and good looking) jeans are just what I need."
5.0,Cute headbands especially for the price!! My 18 month old can wear them.
5.0,Worked great in the pool. Very comfortable with good suction.
5.0,Love that this dress is flowy and it's perfect for a warm day.  Love the pockets too!
5.0,Over the years I have had to resort to using clip on sunglasses that have a tendency to damage my lenses.  These look nice even over my rather comically large glasses.
5.0,We ordered one size bigger and they fit perfect!
5.0,These are the best elastic sports eyeglass holders I have ever owned! And I've been wearing eyeglass straps for 60 years! They have a neat little clasp in the middle that makes them easy to remove or put on. Great idea. And you get 5 of them for about $1 apiece! Great product.
5.0,"I was looking for a cool dress to wear around the house during these hot Texas days. This fits the bill! Loose, thin fabric, and a beautiful print!<br />It would also make a good bathing suit cover! Love it!"
5.0,"More a nubuck material, nice"
5.0,I love these pants! They are so comfortable.
5.0,They fit perfectly and I feel more powerful when wearing them!
5.0,The only bad thing to happen with the ropes were like dry rotten and just fell apart when I tried to put them on the shades. Other wise so far so good I bought them for my Granddaughters for softball season. Good looking pair of shades.
5.0,I like them a lot definitely what I needed
5.0,"Like that I received it really quick, considering COVID 19. I love the feel of the material and it washes very well."
5.0,"Better than I thought, I like that it’s adjustable, no constriction, it’s feminine."
5.0,Good for and received lots of compliments.
5.0,"I love the bright colors on this lightweight coverup!  It is a well made product.  So easy to slip on.  It fits perfect for me.  I am 5’6, 158 pounds.  Great item for this price."
5.0,Very pretty and we'll made
5.0,I'm writing for my husband but he loves these! My son came in from college and tried to take them back with him. So I just ordered more for both.
5.0,I still have mine a year later and still as beautiful as I bought it. 💖
5.0,"Love love this bag. It worked perfectly for my 2 nights away. Could possibly fit 3 to 4 days if not more depending on your packing capabilities. Yes, it works as a carry on for spirit airlines. Great buy!!!"
5.0,My grand daughter's love them.There is always something for them ap Papaws house
5.0,This is an absolutely exquisite piece. I bought this as a gift and it is just breathtakingly beautiful.  I absolutely recommend this seller to everyone
5.0,This is exactly what we were looking for.
5.0,I've been wanting one of the shirts for a couple years since I worked in the sporting good store but they were always too expensive. This price was excellent and I absolutely love the shirt. It's made to fit fairly large  but it looks amazing.  This is really going to be useful for going to games in those chilly fall nights!  Excellent buy!!<br />**** I should mention I am wearing a medium in this picture. I'm 5'6&#34; and this is a perfect fit!!
5.0,Love it.  Absolutely stunning
5.0,Love this cap!!
5.0,"I recently found out I'm allergic to gold and silver and can no longer wear my treasured jewelry.  I began to look for alternatives and discovered these lovely, well made earrings in stainless steel.  Love the color and shine of stainless as well.  So glad I found this seller who obviously cares about their product and presenting and packaging it well.  I would have never even considered stainless steel jewelry before developing allergies but I'm going to do biz with this classy seller again."
5.0,This is what it says it is and works well for me. The soft plastic band was making me break out in a rash. This material has caused no issue so far. It does take on water but dries quickly with air and heat and looks similar to a traditional band. Recommend if you're breaking out with the original band but want something similar.
5.0,"These glasses are the best fitting, the lense are much more clear than other brands where I feel the lenses are always dirty despite cleaning them all of the time.  I hope to find more pairs in other styles because I can't go back to the other reading glasses I own.  One of my best buys!"
5.0,"I bought this dress in black as a bathing suit cover-up. The weigh worked for my purposes, but it is quite sheer. Overall the style and quality is great for the price"
5.0,Received promptly.  High quality authentic Jacques Lemans leather watch band.  Would buy from again.
5.0,These are funny and comfortable. The fabric is smooth and dries quickly.
5.0,I got these to wear for Halloween to be a scarecrow for Halloween at work.
5.0,Didn’t expect much but my husband and I both wore this riding in our skiff - fall in southeast Alaska! Warm and the removable face cover is a plus - ear flaps snap easily above the head<br />We will be getting another
5.0,I have found the fit perfect.
5.0,Daughter loved ring. Just the right size
5.0,The color was great and matched my wife's dress almost perfectly.<br /><br />I have no complaints about this tie at all.
5.0,"Im not trying yet, look good and soft"
5.0,I have purchased these bands in other colors and love them. They are good quality for the price and the colors are fun.
5.0,"Since we all have to wear masks now, those of us who wear glasses have an extra issue to deal with:  while wearing masks, our glasses fog up.  This product stops the fog.  I was surprised by the size of the bottle, it's small, but the product should last a long time because you only need one small squirt on each of your glasses lenses.  The product comes with its own soft wiping cloth that won't scratch your glasses.  I used it on both regular glasses and my sunglasses.  Most importantly, the product works as advertised!  No more fogged up glasses."
5.0,Grandson loves the color and softness.
5.0,"I am very picky when it comes to the quality of shirts, so I was a little skeptical the first time I ordered from Spiral online but I continue to be very happy with the outcome. The shirt, although not heavy weight or thick is still very well made with a high thread count. The shirt is very comfortable and the graphics on the front, back, and sleeve are wonderful. I will be ordering more shirts from this company as long as they supply quality goods"
5.0,"From the first day I put it on I got lots of compliments. I am a teacher, and believe me getting a compliment from a teenager is pretty awesome."
5.0,Very comfortable and a lighter weigh hat that coordinates with some of my BOGNER outfits. Great for warmer weather on the mountain.
5.0,Got these for my bridesmaids to wear in my wedding. They are perfect! And definitely can't beat the price!
5.0,"I purchased a robe just like this (different color) for my mother-in-law several years ago and she wears it constantly!  She's loved it SO much, it's starting to show a bit of wear, so I had to find another.  So glad I found this one and pink is her favorite color, so it will be another Merry Christmas!"
5.0,Awesome colors for my Apple Watch!  Really comfortable and fits perfectly.
5.0,"This keychain is made out of rather soft vinyl/rubber which is what I wanted, won't scratch paint. It is a nice bright orange color.<br />I clipped off the little chain and use this for my motorcycle key and it's a great conversation starter.<br />Fun for the G-fans out here!"
5.0,"The pjs were loved my the receiving parties.<br />They LOVED them . The pjs are very good material, nice and soft .. perfect for this time of year .. thank you<br />From a happy customer!!"
5.0,Love the pockets. Great product for the cost.
5.0,"Great gloves, comfortable, fit perfect, the sizes match with descriptions."
5.0,Looks great on hubbies vest!!
5.0,"Love this shirt, great fit! I usually pair with a funky bralette and it looks cute. I'm typically a small or medium in shirts."
5.0,"I bought this for lap swimming, beach and surfing.  I wanted support but nothing with padded cups. I am 5'7"" , 140lbs, busty (36D) but otherwise not curvy. This suit has great support in the bust and does not cut into my shoulders."
5.0,Beautiful dress. I purchased the blue and went back for the sunflower one. I hope they will bring more colors in XXL.
5.0,"I have to wear compression hose for a deep varicose vein behind my knee.These have worked out great, allowing me to wear sandals during the summer!"
5.0,"Love the price!! Print is nice, navy is beautiful, I bought 2/3 for my average 34 inch 28 lbs 2.5 y.o and it fits perfectly with some space for colder weather layering. (Even lightweight jacket). That is what I was looking for. And I thought for this price and free shipping, it will take forever to get it, but it was ok. Thinking to buy the other color also, really worth the price!! Thank you :)"
5.0,Absolutely love this. It’s comfortable and it isn’t itchy or slip and slide off like some others I’ve tried especially when taking my shield on and off at work. Love this!
5.0,They were exactly as pictured.
5.0,Super awesome boots
5.0,Very comfortable and sexy! Wonderful combination!
5.0,"Nice heavy and sturdy mens cross here, not at all a lightweight piece.  Not too large as to look strange but definitely heavy enough to stay in place around an active mans neck."
5.0,"Really nice quality, my girlfriend loved it"
5.0,"Nothing more to say, I got the tie I expected. It's at a good price, fits well, and feels light around the neck."
5.0,Love these! Super comfortable and the style is awesome. Also a great price on sale.
5.0,My Granddaughter love it
5.0,Very cute and comes in its own box!
5.0,This watch tells the time as is and has the added speaking feature which is great and so can be useful for everyone.
5.0,"The majority of belts I see today are &#34;genuine leather on manmade material&#34;, meaning they have a thin strip of leather over a foam or cloth belt, the leather wears away in a few months leaving the belt looking terrible. This belt is entirely made out of a strip of leather, its high quality and i haven't noticed any wear at all in the last few months of wearing it. I would highly recommend this."
5.0,"Beautiful, fun, easy resort style dress. Love it, only trouble will be finding somewhere to wear it!"
5.0,"Love the fit and the adjustable straps. Soft, comfortable fabric. My favorite mask."
5.0,Hat is a great value. ..get a lot of compliments on it..it looks like it cost a lot more than it did.
5.0,"I've been wearing this all summer and will probably buy it in more colors. It's incredible comfortable and flattering, and it wears and washes well."
5.0,Están lindas pero se nesecita reforzar xk se rompe fácil
5.0,"works very well, really good size.  I can fit a lot more into these than the little aluminum wallets (which always end up breaking).  Really happy with this purchase"
5.0,Was really nice and the quality of the chain was really good. I was very happy with this purchase and my husband loved it for his Christmas present.
5.0,It was a good snug fit. Very pleased with boot.
5.0,Beautiful. Daughter loved them! Picture doesnt do item justice. :)

5.0,These are very nice and the price is great
5.0,Was used as part of a Halloween costume but I have worn it to bed a couple of cold nights! 😄
5.0,It is very lightweight and functional for camping. Can’t wait to get my daughter one as well.
5.0,"I want to preface this by saying I hate socks. These are very comfy, they don't slip, and I can wear them with all of my flats. 10/10 would recommend."
5.0,I like the way you do your business. It Shows! Nice touch on the little bag for the slippers.
5.0,"Warm, great material, would definitely recommend. Soft comfortable."
5.0,Very warm exceeds my expectations
5.0,"The material is soft, it fits to me perfectly, and the colors are vibrant."
5.0,these are perfect they are trendy and fit true to size and you cant be the price. used these to go snow tubbing and they kept me warm / I was comfortable.
5.0,"It is a really well made shirt, but to small for me so i’m Giving it away as a gift."
5.0,Had an initial odor for the first few weeks but it has dissipated.  Love the quality and durability of the bag.  Wish there were more colors.
5.0,Not lightweight but thicker and more durable than most gloves
5.0,Love them 😍
5.0,Very nice shorts and fit as expected. They have a stretch in fabric but are rugged. The redundant string-tie seems to be a bother but it isn't really necessary as the Velcro does the job..
5.0,Worked perfect for my 18mth old. Used a few times and are like a second skin for him. Dont know how well they will hold up because of the other reviews I read but for the money it was worth it for me even if they last a few times.
5.0,Looks nice and the color is a good match to the photo.
5.0,Great polish cloth for my silver jewelry. Great quality and a large size for jewelry. Arrived on time and in great condition.
5.0,Great socks. So cute and stAy on my feet for Pilates. I got small size for my size 8 foot..  I don’t like them to slide off and these fit well.
5.0,"Just the right amount of stretch, not too much cling, doesn't creep up the back. I was a little worried about bending over, but the butt is covered (I don't have much there though) I'm 5'4, usually a 16."
5.0,This sock are colorful and very well made for the price. I will be using them for my Holiday sock exchange.
5.0,Love these Sox. Definitely buying more. They fit well and stay in place.
5.0,My son is a middle school science teacher. Great gift!
5.0,"This was a birthday gift for my best friend, it came right on time and looked great. I did not realize that they &#34;auto-tint,&#34; my friend had them on and when the sun hit we saw them  change to protect his eyes we were both blown away. Thinking about ordering a pair for myself."
5.0,Great product ! Watched a YouTube video on how to install them very easy !
5.0,I was very impressed with these glasses right out of the box.  They seem very sturdy and they seem built to last.  They do not have that cheap glasses feel.  They have a nice weight and feel good on your face.  They look really sharp and I think they will look nice with anything.  They were wrapped up well around the lenses so there were no scratches.  I was very happy with this order!
5.0,Before using the bracket I felt like I was smothering.  Makes breathing easier.
5.0,I loved the fit. They were stretchy enough to fit nice across my mid-section. Looked like I had a flat stomach :)
5.0,I love a lot of pockets and a purse that is not too big.  This purse is perfect!  I have had a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,This works better than I would’ve expected it to.<br />You might have to reapply it once or twice during the course of an 18 hole round Especially if you wipe your ball down a lot but it works well
5.0,"My mother in-law, my significant other and myself are all please with the product. We will definitely be making future purchases. Thanks again 😊"
5.0,"Great fit, very soft and not heavy like others.<br />I love it..."
5.0,"Comfortable and relaxed fit. Product fits just as intended. Kinda tricky for different body types, especially around the abdomen but I guess it agrees with mine. Feels and looks great!"
5.0,"loved the color and the fit, would highly recommend"
5.0,"fun, unique, love them."
5.0,"I bought these for my daughter to go with her dress for a special event.  She loved them, went perfect with her dress."
5.0,"It is warm . I like the idea of it being waterproof , and touch screen ."
5.0,Cute and soft.  Got for my Great Niece and she loved them and the different ways you can wear
5.0,"So far, it seems well made and slim. Two important features for me. Another big plus is the zippered main area, which their other bag doesn't offer. Fits my 17.3 inch HP with a little room to spare."
5.0,A really good shoe tree for my patents and other more expensive shoes
5.0,I love this necklace and earring set.  It is just the statement piece I was looking for! It's very beautiful
5.0,"Bought for my son's Halloween costume and it was great. Material was stretchy enough to wear layers and coat for this year's cold, wet trick or treating. It was long enough to still touch ground with think sole muck boots on. So maybe a trip issue for some. we loved it, he still wears when playing around the house"
5.0,Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sunglasses !
5.0,"This was an absolute steal for about $15. I originally bought this as a fake engagement ring to keep creepy guys from hitting on me at work, but I think I'll just wear this on my right hand because it's so darn pretty. Not only does this sparkle, it will reflect rainbow-y light under fluorescent lights. I love it. Plus, I feel better buying stones created in a lab like this versus mined stones. Well done, Metal Masters Co.!"
5.0,Very comply...without being so heavy
5.0,Much nicer and better quality than I expected for the cost!  Purchased the blue white and red pattern. The red is more maroon than red (incase you're looking to match something).
5.0,Super Sexy
5.0,"If you have a tiny wrist, this may be too large, but the quality is excellent, the inscription clear."
5.0,"I scrolled past this necklace at first but I kept going back to it. It was different and beautiful but I wasn't sure about the price. I received the necklace quickly. It was packaged securely in a bag and bubble wrapped. It comes with a small pink bag for storage. This necklace is, as I had hoped, beautiful and well made. The colors in the necklace pop in person and will coordinate with almost any season. I can easily wear it with casual and dressy outfits. The necklace is lightweight and easy to wear. I'm very happy with my purchase, it is worth the price, and I will purchase other pieces from this brand and seller. My review is not part of any promotional offer and my opinion is my own."
5.0,"I happened upon this dress from a Buzzfeed link. Most of the reviews were positive and the price was good. And when I saw it came in a leopard print I had to have it. Based on the sizing recommendations, I was worried a large might be too small but I ordered that size anyways. I'm 5'6&#34; and I weight around 160 pounds. It turns out the large fits me very well. I will definitely be getting a lot of use from this dress this summer!"
5.0,"One of the best legging I have erev bought, soft and very comfortable, great product for workout and not only."
5.0,wonderful support
5.0,"Well made, beautiful look, but perhaps a bit short for the office. Overall, this is a nice skirt, I just think it might be designed for an elegant night out rather than a day at the office.  Still, a good buy for the price."
5.0,Nice product makes good present
5.0,"beautiful dress,fits perfect,"
5.0,These fit perfect.  Finally found what I was looking for
5.0,It was exactly what we wanted
5.0,"We purchased these for our trip to San Diego. Both us and our kids were able to adjust the straps well, sling them over our shoulders and then head out into the ocean to find sand dollars. The bags held up well and were easy to wash out once the day was over."
5.0,I bought this item as a gift to my son.  He loves it.
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised when I received this shirt and it fit as expected. The color isn't as bright as the picture. It's a dull/olive/green but I still love it. Very comfortable and I wear it with my black leggings.
5.0,Great glasses. Dark without being too dark.
5.0,These are to quality. You can't get a better optical clarity than this for under 50 bucks. Very comfortable and strong at the same time. Long time customer and will continue. Army combat veteran approval.
5.0,"This pajama set is super comfortable, very soft and stretchy so I could use it for breastfeeding. The top was shorter than I thought so I couldn’t really use it as a postpartum pajama in the hospital but it fits perfectly now that all the seeking has gone away."
5.0,I am in love with these compression leggings. I ordered a second pair within minutes of trying them on. They fit like a glove and they are soooo comfortable. I wore them on very cold and windy day and I was very warm and able to remain outside for a very long time.
5.0,beautiful color perfect fit for a 34b all in all i absolutely love dobreva lingerie
5.0,adorable.
5.0,"Love this purse super basic, no inside pockets, but its spacious velvety on the inside and comes with a little mini ""purse"" that clips to the inside, i use that as my inside pocket :)"
5.0,I like them no dislikes
5.0,"Heavy feel, seems to be very well made.  The metal hasn't scratched due to my keys (I expected it might right away).  I'd buy it again knowing what I know now."
5.0,Great item. It was a gift for someone else.
5.0,my husband loved them even when I dried them they Did Not shrink which was a plus
5.0,These are very finely knit and fit well.  Love the cool design.  A great value.  Good quality.  Other fingerless gloves that I looked at appeared to be more loosely knit.  I wanted some that you could wear while typing or writing that would add some warmth but allow easy movement.  This are that exactly.  Perfect.
5.0,Easy replacement after viewing a few utube vids. Glad I didn’t toss the old screws for attaching carb to the tank because the new ones supplied did not fit.
5.0,nice pattern that fits beautifully
5.0,I am 8months pregnant 5'1 195lbs and i bought an xl. Standing up it hit just below my knee. This fit me perfectly! I love this dress and im so happy i bought it laat minute.
5.0,I've used a small front pocket or shirt pocket wallet for at least the past 25 years.  This is by far the best one I've owned and certainly the best value for only $20.  It holds quite a lot for it's size but is still compact enough to fit in a front pocket without a huge bulge.  It seems to be well made with good quality materials.  I've used mine for over a year now and it's holding up fine.  I just purchased a second one to replace my current one when it finally wears out.
5.0,Wanted something sexy for our anniversary. This was so perfect and felt great too.
5.0,"Excelente, buena tela queda hermoso"
5.0,"At first I thought it wouldn't fit my wife. She wears Medium in most clothing but large in a coat. When I saw the XXL I thought they sent the wrong size, but it fit perfect."
5.0,"I'm 5'7, 160 lbs, C cup and the Medium fits perfectly.  This dress is nicely lined, so soft and very comfortable.  I'm so happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!"
5.0,Bought them as a gift and it my niece loves it. It's very pretty and well made.
5.0,"Purchased this crossbody bag for the sole purpose of only using it during a festival I set up at for a few days, but after using it there I have fallen in in love with it! It is a very well made bag, came with 2 different length straps that were also adjustable, and being an animal person, I love the paw print on the front. It did take a while to receive it, but it was well worth the wait. I was able to fit a slim long wallet, an S8+, pen, chapstick, and lighter in this bag without having it bulge out."
5.0,These are so gorgeous!
5.0,"For the price, it can't be beat!! I ordered an XL as I have a larger bust. The jacket fit as I expected. Per the previous review recommendation I ordered 1 size up. I typically wear a size L. The material is lightweight. Reminds me of the slick wicking material in runners clothes. Which is perfect since I'll be using this as part of a costume for a run. Other than having no pockets, this item is exactly what I was looking for. And bonus: the jacket arrived 4 days sooner than the earliest arrival date."
5.0,I put these in my expensive loafers. Makes the fit perfect. They won’t fit unless you need to make shoes tighter.
5.0,They are cute and comfortable. I love it when lace is on the bottom it makes more sense when putting the underwear on.
5.0,I bought this dress for a cruise for elegant night. It is simple but very nice. I love the fit. The top is fitted so not a lot of wiggle room but it fits fine so no worries there. It came with a necklace and brooch which accents the dress wonderfully.
5.0,A gift for my best friend.  She loved it. It came so thoughtfully packaged it was perfect.  The card totally described our friendship.
5.0,I love these rings and got them in both silver and gold. I stack them because otherwise the extending edges could catch on clothes. They are very thin and delicate and that's what I wanted.
5.0,Loooooooooove this watch!
5.0,Indoor/outdoor running. High intensity interval workouts.
5.0,Love the flowiness and fit.
5.0,Gratis purchase
5.0,Got these today and I am beyond happy! There very pretty and exactly what I expected!
5.0,"At first glance I was not excited about this bracelet. No sparkle at all, so I decided to clean the bracelet and wow how beautiful this bracelet is. What a great buy!!!"
5.0,cute cute.  I recommend it.  Comfortable too.
5.0,Love the shirt. Great quality and shipped fast.

5.0,Really awesome rashgard!
5.0,So soft and comfortable. Love the pockets.
5.0,Good for the prive...nice to weasr
5.0,I should have ordered the next size up but they are so pretty.
5.0,"I thought they were alright, my husband said it made his wallet too thick."
5.0,"Bought this dress as the dod.  When I first opened it I was leary as the material is very light.  Once on though I loved it! Fit perfectly, so comfortable to wear and looks fantastic! If you’re on the fence, go for it.  I highly recommend it."
5.0,Lots of pockets and plenty of space to store things. Quality is great!
5.0,"I like these glasses! Comfortable but sturdy. No slipping or sliding off my face. Not flashy looking but these glasses cut glare, protect my eyes from bugs, and are very reasonably priced. All I needed!"
5.0,"It's an apron. It does what it's supposed to do. The color matches the picture. It's a little stiff but I'm sure that'll work itself out after a few washes. If you like what it's supposed to be, you'll like what it is."
5.0,These sports compression shirts fit exactly as expected. They're meant to be a bit tighter and it fits comfortably so you are able to perform to your highest ability. I bought a large and washed them they didn't shrink much. On average I'm a medium but in sports compression shirts I feel most comfortable in a large.
5.0,This is my second set of these socks.  I wear them with shoes that are slightly big on my foot.  They have plenty of cushioning and I love the bamboo material.
5.0,Material was nice
5.0,Absolutely love these! I actually only were one in my tragus piercing and got compliments everywhere I went.
5.0,"This is the cutest infinity scarf!  I've honestly not purchased many clothing items on Amazon.  I decided to try ordering clothing with something small like and scarf.  The first one I received was so nice, that I decided to buy this one.  The reasons that I gave this a 5-Star rating are as follows:<br /><br />*  Quality of the fabric.  It's a very nice fabric - not cheap looking or feeling.<br />*  Print - The print is so cute.  I purchased the bird motif and it isn't childish looking at all.  I wore this to work on Monday and I thought I looked very professional - plus I received a ton of compliments.<br />*  Value - I received this at a discount, but the regular price is well worth it.  You could easily pay double the amount at Francesca's and the quality of this scarf is just as good as any I have purchased at that store.<br /><br />In summary, this is a very nice scarf and I had no problem giving it the highest rating.  As mentioned above, I did receive this at a discount for my honest review.  In fact, I liked it so much, I purchased another one in a different color!  I hope this review was helpful."
5.0,All set!!!
5.0,"I love the design so much that I now feel naked without them!<br /><br />The products I ordered all arrived in time, the sleeves are so pretty and fit so well I was thinking about ordering another set to leave in my car just in case!"
5.0,"These locks keep your pins on your vest, without them coming off , no matter what speed you ride on you motorcycle"
5.0,"I didn't use it yet, but it looks so good."
5.0,"Ok! Want to have some fun!? Buy this inflatable costume! It’s LARGE but brings laughter, joy, and awe wherever it’s worn…also a little embarrassment but, heck, that’s fun too. Am I right?"
5.0,I liked that the charm itself was in a small plastic sleeve to protect it.  Shows attention to detail and care for the product.
5.0,My son loved these!
5.0,Gorgeous bracelet. Love the healing properties of lava rock. It's very luxurious looking.
5.0,These are too cute!!  Fit perfectly!!
5.0,Very nice pendant for a man.  Looks good on my chest.
5.0,"These are perfect- small gem studded posts with a straight end. The post is thinner than some I've tried, so it was easy to get into my piercing even after not having a stud in for a couple weeks. Great deal!"
5.0,"This boot is absolutely wonderful. The leather is very soft and required no breaking in at all. I ordered them in a size 8, which is my normal size.The fit is a little narrow compared to my other Frye boots, but roomy in the toe box, which is perfect for me as I have narrow feet and longer toes."
5.0,"Fit well, nice fabric."
5.0,"Thin, light material great pjs love them."
5.0,I purchased this item because I could no longer get this type of wallet insert in the stores.  It is good quality and fits perfectly.  I am glad I ordered 2 because they were well worth it.  Now I can once again use one of my favorite wallets.
5.0,"Looks just like actual wayfarers! Product came exactly as described, very satisfied with the glasses. I would highly recommend these"

5.0,fits perfect and love it. Just might to have to buy another one
5.0,Love this braclet very comfortable.
5.0,I love this dress I used it for a quinceañera. I'm 5'0 and it was a perfect length. The thigh slit is a little high up I had to use a safety pin to keep it a little more closed. I have butt and thighs so maybe that's why but over its a great dress. A little on the sheer side so I did wear biker shorts underneath. Received lots of compliments
5.0,Im using it for my muay thai training!
5.0,Keeps sh*t dry
5.0,Beautiful color and luster.  Why pay more?  Goes with all my other chocolate pearl jewelry.
5.0,"Soft, stretchy, bright colors"
5.0,Love these snowflake earrings.  I especially like the backing that holds the earrings in place.  Very comfortable!!  going to look for more earrings from this vendor!
5.0,Nice soft micro fleece!  Heavy weight also. Very satisfied
5.0,"Love this band, so comfortable"
5.0,"Great product 👍🏻, I was unsure to purchase since it had no reviews and only one star BUT I’m glad I did quality is great. This does say it’s a size xxl/xxxl but it’s more like a xl my husband is between a L/XL and it fit him perfect the pants were a little snug but they’ll do the mask was awesome looks legit. Happy Holidays and merry GRINCHMAS 🎄"
5.0,Make sure you order larger. Awesome but runs small
5.0,fast shipping.. super comfty. light weight. even fit perfect for pregnancy
5.0,4 pairs really nicely made small cz earrings with safety clasps are perfect for adults or kids.  Love them.  Highly recommend
5.0,Used in a children's church event. It was exactly what we need and as advertised.
5.0,"Material is light but durable. Straps are a little difficult to get to size, lots of room for the straps to be adjusted for bigger gals up top. Real metal buttons and stitching appears to be good. I preferred a large And am pregnant. A large will fit me pre baby weight. Right now, I can comfortably slide the waist area up over my belly and it’s still freaking adorable!! My only wish is that it came in more colors, patterns and had pockets aside from the one on the chest. I’d stop wash it in a delicate bag but for the price, IM BUYING MORE!!!"
5.0,fit well and are warm
5.0,Great quality matches description
5.0,Perfect bamboo for Nezuko Cosplay
5.0,Igual de hermosa que en la foto y excelente calidad
5.0,Super soft and is exactly how it looks in the picture I will be buying more!
5.0,It's a snug fit and the material is really soft and a little stretchy.  It has not faded but I suggest air drying to keep its original size but it would be fine either way since the material is like silk.
5.0,Great selection of masks! Love them
5.0,The fit is flowy. I love the softness as well. The length is perfect. 5'5 115lbs.
5.0,Love these jammies! Well made and soft. I’m sleeping better in the cotton- synthetic fabrics don’t breathe and be itchy.
5.0,The dress has the shorts built in the dress and comfortable.  Very pretty.
5.0,Good material! Fit as expect
5.0,"Love the red orange color and the light weight of the fabric. It’s not sheer by any means and it has a lining in it. I got it on a lightning deal but unsure if I would have paid more than that. I’m 5’2” about 120 pounds and a 34 c and got a small. It fits perfectly with a bit of extra room in the elastic waist. If your larger busted, go up a size. It’s a high lo hem and the front goes to my ankles and the back grazes the ground without heels. I got a small not a medium like the post says. It fits great!"
5.0,Very Beautiful! Will buy from this seller again!
5.0,"Yes, this shirt suns small. I actually ordered 2 sizes up and it fits great! It’s a beautiful shirt and a thin fabric but not too thin. I love the fake buttons and ribbing!."
5.0,I love these sunglasses!!!! they are better than what I expected and almost weightless. I got these glasses because I wanted the Silhouette gases that Tom Cruise wore on Collateral. I saw the price or those and glasses and knew that if I bought them I would be just flushing it down the toilet because I would either lose them or get them broke like I have with other glasses that I have bought before. When I saw these I just had to have them and am glad that I did.
5.0,Súper cute
5.0,This is a beautiful classy necklace. It is lightweight to wear and not made of that cheap smelly metal. It is dressy and or casual.

5.0,Fits well and is sturdy
5.0,"I believe I ordered a medium and I love it. I like the soft material and it’s not too tight on me or anything. I’m small chested, about 32B and average weight."

5.0,"Gave this to my sister for her birthday. She thought it was beautiful. A pair of earrings came with it that were not expected, they were pretty too."
5.0,"These run a little larger than our other under armour tennis shoes. We bought the same size as his old shoes but they seem a size larger. They were stiff at first, but after a week of regular use, my son loves them."
5.0,Beautiful. Love it !
5.0,a gift to daughter
5.0,I returned it because I have a closet full of red dresses. It was cute and lightweight.
5.0,"The product came in a beautiful box, perfect gift."
5.0,I disliked that the quality of the material looks way fancier than in person
5.0,Best little romper for my daughters first birthday!
5.0,Nice top - I like the high neckline.  Fits as expected.
5.0,Adorable and VERY comfy socks!!
5.0,Item was as advertised and arrived on time.  What more can I ask?
5.0,IT COMES IN HANDY BECAUSE THERE'S A COMPARTMENT FOR MY CELLPHONE AND MY CARDS...
5.0,Ordered a medium for my 12 year old I<br />Who is very small for his age. It fits him pretty good!!!
5.0,Works great! Helped my brother with sport smells!
5.0,"My original band broke after 3+ years of daily use, glad to find these replacement bands.  Inexpensive, fit perfectly as the original.  Only needed the black band but decided on purple too, just for fun. So far, so good!"
5.0,"I live in the pacific northwest so the idea of fleece-lined leggings was literally life-changing. These pants are buttery soft and even though they're fleece-lined, they don't look bulky at all. Their high waist has good elasticity so they stay in place. I got them a week ago and I've worn them everyday since. Get yours today."
5.0,Love this dress it’s so much better in person
5.0,"attractive and easy to wear hoops, recommend"
5.0,"Super soft fabric! I am 5’6” tall and 190 lbs, I ordered the xl and it fit perfectly! I am more apple shaped, so bigger in the middle than the hips, so somebody with a smaller waist should go down a size in my opinion."
5.0,"I love this dress, the fabric is very good also the size was correct to the size chart."
5.0,I would definitely recommend these!
5.0,I Just love it. It's warm and fashionable.  Great for the fall months
5.0,These glasses look and feel good as described. Also very slightly tinted to take away the screen brightness. I've often walked away from the computer and totally forgotten that I am wearing these and not my prescription glasses.
5.0,"I wanted something warm for the winter, I bought this hat after reading all the reviews, it arrived the other day and it is worth every penny, I will have it for many years to come and love it"
5.0,Ermosa
5.0,It is a exact replacement
5.0,Perfect fit for me and they are indeed comfortable
5.0,I love this sweater! It's soft and pretty and fit just right.
5.0,the quanlity is good. i didn't expect it to fit as expected just by looking at the size chart and estimate the size i need for this dress. I will definite buy other product of the brand and style.
5.0,You have to understand it is not in American sizes. If you don’t check the size chart and choose the one that fits you that’s your own fault.<br /><br />I’m a size medium and I got an XXL. These fit so nicely and I wear them in uniform all the time. They don’t ride up and they’re so comfy.<br /><br />I’ve bought from this seller two times before and buying once more because I love them that much.
5.0,"Very cute necklace! My daughter is really going to love this!! Great deal, at that price you can't lose :)"
5.0,Worked out perfectly for a graduation gift
5.0,These are made off wool but are very soft. Not scratchy or itchy at all!  Easy to wash on the gentle cycle and came out looking like new!
5.0,It's a good pin. It's a little heavy and uncomfortable to wear on a regular plain shirt but it's definitely a good lapel pin.
5.0,"A gift for someone who appreciates fingerless gloves, she loved them for both color and fit. They're a &#34;one size fits most&#34; type of glove and it's true."
5.0,"Love this fits perfectly I'm a B cup, and looks just like the picture."
5.0,She loves this outfit.
5.0,"These socks are very cute and warm.  One can see them peeking out of my riding boots.  Even though the package arrive well before the date listed, it seemed to take forever to get them."
5.0,Super good quality and great value ❤️❤️ My bridal party loves them
5.0,These were a big hit!
5.0,"Loved the dress, great for my wedding day"
5.0,"Red is slightly more Burgundy in the picture than red, but only slightly. Gorgeous and great fit! Wish they had bigger sizes though because I technically should've gotten a cup size up and down one in band size but they don't have my size. Still fit pretty well though!"
5.0,nice love it and also get on time satisfied with the service wonderfull 5 stars
5.0,"I am so in love with this jumpsuit!! It’s very comfy, fit was perfect but I paid attention to the measurements in their size chart.  It’s cotton and lightweight and you can dress up or down.  Will probably buy in other colors!"
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous.  While it looked like a casual sundress online, when it came in it is actually a bit more dressy because of the material it is made of (not cotton, but a more shiny, sleek material).  So, although it was not exactly what I expected when I purchased it, it was gorgeous!!"
5.0,I have another sling which I use for work. I use this one for the weekend. It makes traveling with a few thing easy.
5.0,very nice product in a very good quality
5.0,i gave this to my friend and she loves it
5.0,Love them they are soooooo nice and I can wear them with anything and they fit just right
5.0,Perfect size and beautiful on.
5.0,"I like my personalized hats, the embroidery is very fine, cute, I used it today at work, it is very comfortable."
5.0,"Order one size down! Other than that I was shocked by how comfortable and lifting this bra was. Awesome soft material, no cinching if you order 1 size up, and THE CLEAVAGE! It’s absolutely insane what a difference this bra makes. Same cleavage that I get from $60 VS bras and infinitely more comfortable."
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much from this watch but am so glad I bought it.  It is simple, sturdy and looks very classy for a white, silicone watch.  Definitely worth it!"
5.0,"Have this to my dragon loving granddaughter, she loves it"
5.0,"Nice chain, large cross. Really like it."
5.0,i bought this items because i love fancy things<br />i'm so in love with my watch<br />it is super cute and super nice<br />Exactly like the picture
5.0,These are my everything pants! Teaching yoga taking yoga travel everyday errands... We're a different pair every day! Also love to support eco-conscious companies like this one!
5.0,Strong Material
5.0,Im 5'6 130lbs and i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. It's a bit cheeky in the back but if u dont mind then it's fine!
5.0,Fits perfectly over my shoes size 7.5
5.0,I bought this for a friend in the Caribbean and they said this is great. Keeps the arm cool even when exposed to the direct sun. Would definitely recommend this item!!
5.0,I had to order an xlarge so it would fit right in the shoulders. I usually only wear a large. It washes really well and if hung on a hanger immediately out of the dryer it does not need ironed. I love it.
5.0,I bought it for Valentine's it was nice
5.0,Ninguna pieza dañada
5.0,"This is a really cute dress. It's<br />perfect for hot Florida weather.<br />It's light and floaty but not see<br />through. It has pockets so that's<br />a bonus. I wish it came in extra small. I'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 100 lbs.  Luckily I can adjust the drawstring and make it work for<br />me. Hopefully it might shrink a bit.  It's too cute not to make it work!"
5.0,"Shoe is a little pricey at the moment- 80 bucks would be fair. I see these being discounted in upcoming months. That said shoe can be worn right out of box and its light, comfy and pretty great. The fabric is water resistant treated so  yes they wont look like leather boot or a sneaker they have a dull sheen and are fine at a casual office or about the town or on light hikes. Because the soles are soft and light i suppose they will wear within a year, which again makes the price to much at over 120. Id buy again without hesitation in every color if i could afford. Not made in US but material isnt cheap in anyway. Stitching and seams are well sewn. Laces waxed and durable. I wear a 9-1/2 and thats what mine our and fit FINE. BTW i wear Red Wing, Clarks, Rockport and Danner. These rank 2nd in comfort and by far the lightest."
5.0,Just what I was hoping for. It is flattering and the low cut is perfect on me doesn’t show too much. It is also the perfect length just above the knee a little. I really like it!
5.0,"true to size, soft, they're great. would definitely buy another color."
5.0,"i liked very much, I recommend this product! It easy to put on the ear and do not fall down! I am very happy with it."
5.0,Very cute and well built. True to size. My so. Loves them.
5.0,"It's great, better than I imagined."
5.0,Fits true to size. Nice color.
5.0,I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooo in love with these shoes!!! they are comfortbale and extremely versatile!! I can not wait to wear them everywhere!!
5.0,"I purchased this on clearance, and for the price you can't beat it.  It is actually a very nice bag.  I have a large 15&#34; laptop that I ordered a laptop bag for a business trip and the bag did not get here in time.  I had to use this bag to carry my laptop through the airports on my trip.  It held up very well.  It is a large bag, but not too big to use as a purse."
5.0,My favorite for the summer.
5.0,"I really, really liked this dress. More than I expected to. It's a little sheer, I've been using it as a swimsuit coverup. It's very flowy and breathable. Very cute"
5.0,"It is so pretty,  my daughter loves it!"
5.0,"I've been looking for a comfortable sleep shirt for awhile. This is a great one. Perfect length, fits great and is so soft and not itchy like some others."
5.0,Nice.  Better than expected.
5.0,"Wow this is so comfy. I didn't think it would be as soft as the product description makes it out to be, but it definitely exceeded expectations. It fits just right, looks cute for a nightgown and is very comfy. It's enough so that I don't feel stuffy in it but also still warm enough not to need to bundle up extra. I recommended!"
5.0,"Light weights, cute but thought they were going to be a little bigger."
5.0,Product arrived on time for my daughter
5.0,"Great looking shoes, but just a little tight. When buying Lacoste shoes I usually go up half a size, I wear 9.5 but on Lacoste I buy 10, even with that increment, these are to tight on the toes, they feel as if theyre pushed from the heel to the front, the heel will also be a little uncomfortable at first. I had to have them lengthened by a cobbler. The quality is superb and the look is elegant and modern."
5.0,"I allowed my 13 year old granddaughter to choose her own present and this is what she wanted...it's got lots of strings its' light weight and she loves it, enough said."
5.0,So soft and the perfect size.  A soft gray color.
5.0,I love them!!! Just like the picture. Arrived quickly too.
5.0,"Yep, I love these."
5.0,"Es duradera, juvenil y resistente"
5.0,I thought I was going to get terrible quality shoes but they are actually very nice and the lights are so bright. My son keeps calling them light up yeezys lol<br />Well now that I saw them I will be ordering 2 more pairs for the rest of the kids.
5.0,They delivered the product before the date agreed. The sent the color I wanted. Nice shirt. Soft and very comfortable.
5.0,Very pretty ' kinda cheap but i love it
5.0,great satchel love it.
5.0,I am very satisfied with this cap.
5.0,Fits just how it should
5.0,Like the looks....Use them for reading and for work in the studio.....Work well
5.0,I have a wide face and the majority of sunglasses sold at stores are too small. These were a perfect fit. The plastic is not high quality but if you treat them well they should last a really long time. I’ve even popped out the lenses so I can wear them With a costume.
5.0,"OMG. The pictures don't do this dress justice. I gave it 5 stars just for the look and how well it's made. Definitely worth the price. My main issues are length (too long for my 5'4"") and too tight in the bust area (in my case, I now know I need to size up). Hopefully the seller will  incorporate petite lengths in their lineup. Trying to hem the dress would take away from the fabulousness of the lace bottom."
5.0,"Order up a size. A bit tight around the shoulders and arms, but I love it anyway. Quick ship. I think it might be one of those lost in translation sizing things."
5.0,These are not junky boots. Very nice and the price was ok too!

5.0,"Perfet fit,perfect feel"
5.0,"I'm quite a fan of the Awesome 360 brand, their clothing items are always hip, great quality & offer so many fun styles. These men's swim trunks were no different than the quality I've come to expect with the brand.<br /><br />Right away you can tell it's well made, tight stitchings, no loose threads, waistband offers a relaxed elastic. There's a bright white mesh undergarment attached to the interior of the shorts as well as the two front pockets. There are no back pockets which makes these shorts mainly functional for swimwear. Had it added back pockets one would be able to add these to their casual wear. Sometimes after swimming guys can throw on a t shirt and head to the hot dog stand, bar, or run errands with their swim trunks if they have enough pockets. These don't appear as versatile, but one could still try if they carried a minimalist front pocket wallet as these are very lightweight and dry quickly.<br /><br />I love that the drawstrings are patterned to blend in. It goes without saying my hubby loves his swim trunks, he says they're roomy, very comfortable and are the perfect length arriving just above the knee.<br /><br />Both the colors and designs all mesh well together making these an attractive pair of shorts to wear. These are just beautiful shorts color-wise. We would definitely recommend these shorts"

5.0,My fiance loves this thing.

I wish it had a button in the front to pull in the back tighter, but i just took a few tassels from each side and tied them together...perfect. I am going to order the tan one too. The shingles went from the top of my butt and sexily hang to lower thigh just above the knee. Love it."

5.0,Exactly what I needed for a shadow box project and arrived quicker than expected.
5.0,"This is a really cute dress, perfect for a party or special occasion when you really want to shine! I love the fit of this dress although it runs small in size.  I ordered an xl for 145 lbs 5’3” frame, so order up a size!  But gosh, It looks great!  It is very well made.  The material has a lot of stretch to it and hangs perfectly!  I love the hemline and how it’s longer in the back.  The length is perfect and hits right at my knees in the front. It’s so flirty and unique! I love the gathers in the front, it makes for a very comfortable and forgiving fit, with no bulges to be seen anywhere! The ties would work in back as well as the front, although I tied in front just because it’s different and cute! I have washed this dress one time and it laundries well. I would highly recommend this dress.  I think most women would be pleased with this one!"

5.0,Our grandson loves it!
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful necklace - better than I was expecting. It's very dainty, which is exactly what I was looking for. The pearls are clearly faux, but that's what I was expecting at this price point, but they still look beautiful and would fool anyone with a good eye, unless they got their hands on them.<br /><br />It's actually more like 18"" than 16"" when the clasp is fastened at the nearest link, but that's perfect for me. You will still have a couple of inches on the extender chain, if you want to wear it longer, but don't expect an actual 16"". The links on the chain closer in aren't big enough to use to shorten it.<br /><br />Great deal, especially for such a low price. We shall see over time if the finish holds up."
5.0,"Hard to find good quality and truly contemporary adjustable rings, as they always end up looking a bit juvenile in style and material.<br />This actlly looks great and feels great on the finger. I'm obsessed, I will always buy from this company."
5.0,"This is a lightweight, inexpensive solution to small suitcases are large briefcases without wheels.  I use it for a case weighing about 20 pounds.  The wheels are large enough for uneven surfaces such as driveways.  I am very satisfied."
5.0,"Received necklace as pictured, cloth to shine, and a durable gift bag! Definitely worth it! I gave it as a gift and it was perfect."
5.0,The hood easily detached from the jacket. It could've used a zipper or buttons to secure the garment.
5.0,"Very comfortable and logo stands out even after washing. I got an XL instead of my normal L, was big when first put on out of the box, after washing fit perfectly. Will definitely order other shirts from this company instead of other manufacturers."
5.0,"I bought this jacket in Black & Red. Light weight, easy to wash, very stylish and comfortable.  Definitely worth the price! I get tons of compliments I wear both of these. I would recommend!"
5.0,daughter loves the look and that is  thin and not bulky. it is more &#34;spring&#34; jacket than anything.

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:12a1da82d8c9a586f0d19b66e1997fc4]] I love these!!<br />They DONT come laced - but I attached a video how to do it! There are two layers of lace holes because there IS NO TONGUE* (I said “tag” in the video but I meant tongue). This is what makes the lacing confusing but it’s super simple and WELL WORTH THE BUY!<br /><br />These shoes are BRIGHT WHITE, flexible, great quality and my kids love them. 2.5 year old says they are comfy!<br /><br />PLS DONT BUY THESE OUT I WANT MORE😂"

5.0,My cosplayer put this on and I was immediately envious of the 6-pack! Very realistic and believable.
5.0,"I needed to make a super hero costume to make one of my friends comic book characters come to life! I found this leotard and it worked PERFECTLY!! I had to sew in a bra (would not stay over my boobs without one, uncool), and it worked even better! People kept thinking I was from Mortal Kombat lol"
5.0,I’ve been looking everywhere for a pair of leggings that don’t fall down or are see through and these are them! They fit really well and I didn’t have any sweat or underwear show during my workout. They also are squat proof! BUY THEM!
5.0,"I love my boots, one of the best purchases I have made 👍🏽"
5.0,"These polarized glasses are, for the money, the best sunglasses that I've ever owned. You don't have to spend a small fortune $200+ on ONE pair of sunglasses that you know you'll toss around all summer long. These Bellbesson's can handle the beach and then some. A &#34;Best Buy&#34; in my opinion."
5.0,"The earring shipped fast and the quality is great. It looks flawless despite it being handmade, and it fits great. It came in a cute little bag and was packed safely."

5.0,"We just returned from vacation, had a great time! I purchased these luggage tags because on our last trip our bags and tags were demolished by the airline! We got new suit cases and these tags. They are AWESOME! They hook on nicely so you can see the bright colors coming down the luggage carrousel. No rubber ties or strings, the metal ring hooks tightly and stays in place. I am ordering more for my travel friends!"
5.0,"Perfect costume very cute.  This size fit a 12 yr old 90 lb girl, almost 5 feet.  Very authentic."
5.0,The glasses are extremely comfortable and light weight. I might order another pair in a different color.
5.0,"After a few years of wearing suits like a corporate robot and buying those damned dress socks that come in a 3 pack with 3 different patterns, most of which are ugly as sin, I found my self with a drawer full of these time sucking mismatched burdens. Every time I did laundry, it was a half-hour game of memory, and there was always one left over at the end! One day I said, screw this!, bagged them all up, looked at my pile of worthless white socks, which also had a few too many varietals, threw those in too, and dropped them off at the homeless encampment under the freeway.<br />So, i didn't have any socks for a couple days but, when these came, I loved them so much that I bought three more packs! They are comfortable, have a nice little compression to the feet, don't smell like hell like my dress socks did at the end of the day, and I never have to match and fold socks again! Pile them all in the drawer, and any two that I pull out in the morning always match. Hours of my life have been given back to me. And they say you can't buy time!"
5.0,Love the color and shape. I little different from the usual. Looks elegant
5.0,Just what I wanted in time for vacation
5.0,"Love this dress, lots of compliments."
5.0,This is exactly what I expected.  Nice material and fit.
5.0,"Love the shades/sunnies! They are so stylish and fly. I say this as a person that normally purchases designer shades (Tom Ford, Celine, Fendi, etc.) They arrived in tip top shape and the packaging was perfect. Not to mention How cool it was for the seller to reach out to assure my pavjage arrived without incident...awesome customer service! Great job! Will buy again."
5.0,This will be a very nice addition to my earing wardrobe!
5.0,Tombs up
5.0,I love this Lavender Cover Up/Dress & I really love the material it's nice & light.  It fits good even though I could have went a size down; it's a very comfortable material that has plenty of coverage.  I haven't decided if I'm gonna wear it as a Cover-Up or a Dress yet because it could be either.
5.0,I recently had cataract surgery for both eyes.  My distance vision is now wonderful but the dashboard in my car and the instrument panel in my aircraft are now a little blurry.  These stick-on bifocal lenses make my sunglasses just right.
5.0,This shirt is absolutely beautiful!! So girly and flirty!! Getting more colors
5.0,Perfect fit! I'm a size 8 and order a medium. I received compliments all night! I want to order it in other colors!
5.0,I like to wear them beause of beautiful lace and different colors.
5.0,"Love this logo - a cool design that will be appreciated by most but only recognized by true fans. Logo is right at 1 inch, with the jump ring and bail adding 3/8"" to the height.  Nice cable chain which I measured at 18-1/2"" plus a 2"" extender. Generous bail which could fit a larger chain (2.25mm maybe?). Logo has what I would call a high-polish edge, brushed face, and matte interior finish which gives it nice dimension. Can't attest to durability since I just got it, but don't anticipate any problems.  Happy!"
5.0,I live this too and ordered another one. The size could be a bit bigger. But still keeping it. Super soft and flattering
5.0,Very nice perfect

5.0,I love the pastel colors and the high waist! Super cute suit. I’m 2 years postpartum so my body is not what it used to be. I wanted something that made me feel cute and covers my little mom belly. This did all that!
5.0,I would like them to be a little shorter.  After a long trip I am ready to take them off.
5.0,"These shoes are so stylish, comfortable and light weight. They do run a little small I got a half size bigger and they fit perfect. Definitely would buy again."

5.0,"adorable, flattering, can dress it up or wear more casually.  A great dress."
5.0,Since I’ve bought puma before it’s exactly what I expected
5.0,"I liked that this costume was stretchy & form fitting, but I wasn't able to slip flats inside the costume. Luckily, I had opened gold one inch heels so I could walk around. I added the red haired wig. I wore this costume only indoors while giving out candy to trick-or treaters on Halloween 2020. I bought a size medium.

5.0,"I purchased these cubes before flying on a vacation where I knew I would need clothes for both hot and rather cool temperatures.  Knowing that i would be packing more items than usual in the same space, the packing cubes looked like the way to go, and they were great!  I used one for tops folded on a home-made folding board, and a second one for rolled pants and a long skirt.  Underwear was packed in a separate, smaller cube I already owned, and shoes, socks, hair styling tools, etc were packed around the edge.  I was limited to one rolling carry-on plus one personal item that would fit under the airline seat, and with the cubes I managed to organize and pack everything efficiently.  Wrinkling was held to a minimum and only required a slight sprinkle of water and temporary hanging to look fresh.  It was easy to pack and repack at different locations, and because everything was so compact and well organized, I never misplaced anything, nor did I stress over inspections by airport security.  I will continue to use these packing cubes on future vacations, and I consider them well worth the modest cost I paid for them."
5.0,Gave this as a gift to my friend. She enjoys the feel and warmness of this Pullover Hoodie. Material is great. Nice and soft.
5.0,More of a vibrant color in real life. The inside is so soft! Very nice overall
5.0,Exactly as described - I wear them daily.
5.0,Like description.  Thanks.
5.0,This is the second time I am ordering this. I love it. Hope they never stop producing this
5.0,[[VIDEOID:b145b4f33e8bb366279281e5b30c8174]] I have thick arms so it was kinda tight but other than that it was a💯
5.0,Beautiful dress. Love the fit.
5.0,My Husky likes to pull A LOT. The expansion of the lease and being hands free is the idea product for a eager puppy. I would highly recommend.
5.0,"I liked the it fits , what I did not liked was where the second button on the was placed , it could have been a 1/2 lower"
5.0,"It is attractive, dressy, lightweight and warm.  Perfect for my needs—I like to wear them under tunics to provide color and warmth to neck and arms."
5.0,This dress is absolutely adorable!  I loved it so much that I ordered it in other colors so I can wear it all the time!  It does run small so make sure you look at the size chart. I can't wait for the winter so I can wear it with boots too!
5.0,"Bought for my 10yr old, fit perfect"
5.0,I got a large because these kind of dress fit .. fit ... the dress was 🥰
5.0,Hat comes as described! Great buy!
5.0,"These are comfortable, form fitting, almost exactly as expected. Ensure you use the right sizing chart, these are small, even in the xxl size.<br /><br />My only complaint is the embroidery of the anchor bunches up the material around it slightly, while not harming the form of the garment it looks a little odd."
5.0,Great fit<br />Vibrant colors
5.0,Great for kids!  Very affordable for children's polarized sunglasses.
5.0,They are prefect! Nice colors and great fit.
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at the perfect fit, comfort and stylish look of this leggings.  I highly recommend them to wear with a tunic for any kind of event."
5.0,Soft and feels great
5.0,"These Ray Bans come in size 61m and size 58mm its important to check which size lenses you intend to buy, but great fit i'll be purchasing more."
5.0,"This dress far exceeded my expectations, for it.  The style, of the dress, and it's print are both flattering and fun!  I am very impressed with the multiple color options I have.  However, one negative I can find, regarding the dress, is that the fabric can become a bit sheer, if you have a larger chest.  Other than the fact that I may need to layer up, to cover my top, I would recommend this dress ALL DAY! 😍❤✌"
5.0,Beautiful studs though they are very small and dainty. Looks like they would be great for a child's first pair of earrings. The backs are not screwbacks though.
5.0,Looks like a great shoe. Exactly what I wanted but runs a half size small. Returned did not have size needed. Disappointed
5.0,This top gets worn more with other bottoms! It’s so cute! It’s gifted and loved!
5.0,I use it all the time
5.0,Super fast shipping and great customer service. I have been wearing hoops as my lip piercings for years and thought studs would be a nice change. They are so cute and I absolutely love them :)
5.0,"I have tried so many different brands of orthotics for my plantar fasciitis. These....hands down...are the BEST insoles Inhave ever used. They fit my foot perfectly! The arch is slightly higher than on other orthotics, which makes them perfect for me. They cradle the heel nicely and have the right amount of firmness, making them very comfortable. I am ordering more so I have them for all of my shoes."
5.0,"Sometimes you never know with socks, but these felt great the first time I put them on and I like the colors. Good match with jeans."
5.0,Good material. Loving them ❤️

5.0,Quality is goog
5.0,Perfect for our Fourth of July bbq - fit as expected and very comfortable!
5.0,"I really like these. They look just like in the photo on here and are actually kind of heavy, not just a flimsy plastic bead. I wore them in my son's 3yr pictures and am quite happy with them. They weren't bothersome at all when I was wearing them... don't know what else to say about them!!"
5.0,This cap is everything to me it’s lightweight I love the way u can adjust the cap in the back to fit your head very very comfortable it’s a must have I will be getting all colors 😊
5.0,"This fits like a glove, or a second skin. No need to keep fidgeting with it as it doesn't slide all over your body or bunch up anywhere. Honestly looks pretty cool as well. Material is comfortable, dries quickly, and washes easily."
5.0,This item is perfect.  I tried it on with a sweater and a dress and I love it.  The elastic under the arms holds it in place.  Wish it came in black with the same peter pan collar.
5.0,This a very well designed and high quality product.  The design is very ergonomic.
5.0,Like the fot
5.0,"The Original Aviator - Full Mirror Lens(3 Piece Silver Set) are Great. They are really dark sunglasses. They work perfectly in the Sunshine State - Florida.  It was a great deal. One of my children is always loosing their sunglasses. With 3 pairs they should be able to find a pair to wear. I purchased them for my own use, but when one of my children seen them and tried on the sunglasses the new sunglasses were no longer mine. I will not let anyone see my next set The Original Aviator - Full Mirror Lens (3 Piece Silver Set)"
5.0,"My husband needed a white dinner jacket for a one time, maybe two time thing.  The fit was great, the quality good, and it was received in a timely manner.  For the price, it was a good deal.  He looked sharp and was well satisfied."
5.0,"The band was easy to install, and it's beautiful! Price is great. I have an assortment of bands for the Apple Watch, and other watches. This one is the best of them all! I'm using it on my most used watch. I had to remove 6 links to make it fit my wrist. The included tool is useless. The best tool is a metal paperclip that just fits in the whole. With that change, I recommend this band to anyone."
5.0,Really like this case. Holds everything I need and is well made.
5.0,"Bought several of these kinds of shirts to wear after shoulder surgery. This shirt was the best. The zippers makes it easy to put on and take of, much easier than snaps or Velcro. The material is soft and comfortable."
5.0,"Good and Kawaii, the heart is pretty big like the image."
5.0,Great souvenir.
5.0,Fits as expected great turkey day dress for the baby
5.0,I love this dress. I wore it for a night out with the girls. I got so many compliments
5.0,These suspenders worked great and were a hit at prom! Definitely recommend them to be the life of the party.
5.0,"I was so excited to find these boots in black. I own the same ones in grey and they are my favorite boots ever. You wouldn't think platfom heels would be comfortable. But, I shoot pool all night wearing these. The toe box is wider and the ankle seems to support alittle. I like that calf is adjustable. This is an excellent design. I wear them constantly. Btw, they are sexy as hell. A little bonus."
5.0,"I was sure I would be returning this. First, the print is bold and loud, which is not typically my style. Second, I was sure it would balloon out and have too much fabric for my taste. I was wrong. What I love about it is that it is quite long but hangs straight, and it doesn't hug the backside at all. The band at the bottom pulls in slightly to give it shape. The fabric is easy care. Don't get me wrong--this is not designer quality. I wouldn't expect that for the cost. It is not lined and is just a simple cardigan with simple sewing and construction. But I can wear it with black jeans or pants or black yoga pants and a tank. It's great."
5.0,"I bought these to wear at my desk, perfect with the usb port, extremely soft and memory-foam like cushion inside, the plug part simply zips out of site and they are super cute. Heat up decently quick, and when they get to the too-hot point i just unplug them and my feet are kept comfortably toasty."
5.0,Love mine.
5.0,Love these pajamas will be getting more soon fit exact. Wash perfect I don’t dry so not sure if they Shrink but for me there perfect

5.0,"In my view, you can never have too many reading glasses around your home. This is a lovely assortment of readers with vintage-looking rhinestone trim on the frames. They are well-made and feature spring hinges as well as storage bags. You cannot find a better deal! I couldn't be more pleased."
5.0,"It is delicate, pretty, and falls perfectly. Excellent product for the money!"

5.0,These socks held up really well in all day wear! I wore them for a 10 hour day in my boots - was pleasantly surprised how dry my feet stayed and they did not get over-warm. Very much like! Will order more. I washed and dried them with no special care at all.
5.0,Me encantó muy bello!!

5.0,"Great dress! Bought the purple one too!<br />White is a bit see through on top as you can probably see the polka top bra I have. Pockets are great! Price is fantastic!  Material feels good and machine washable! Yasss!!! Bought a petticoat to go underneath can’t wait to see how it looks!<br />Bought medium- I’m 5’2”, 150#, wear 6/8 in pants/dresses."
5.0,"This is exactly what I was looking for to replace the leather band that came with my Citizen DRIVE WDR 3.0 (orange/black face).  My biggest gripe with the leather strap was that it made the watch uncomfortable to wear, this silicone band however is not only extremely comfortable but the orange stitching matched the orange color on the watch almost exactly."
5.0,Snow boots works great n warm n comfortable
5.0,Love it to PEICES its amazing and holds onthere
5.0,I ordered the two purple ties. They are both beautiful. The packaging was great also. I wish I would have ordered more.
5.0,Workout pants. The stretch with you and look nice
5.0,"I love these so much. Only negative is I wish the band was thicker (longer). Otherwise, great, especially while working on the postpartum body. Thicker material so definitely not see-through. Husband says the backside looks great 😂 I would buy them in every color of the rainbow."
5.0,"glasses holders made for on-the-go.<br />good quality, easy to use and change.<br />great stuff!"
5.0,"I bought mine oversized because I’m currently chonky lol<br />That being said- it’s SUPER comfy and feels like it gets more comfortable after each wash. One of those hoodies that will eventually be stolen by your bff. And when you catch them wearing it, they’ll look you dead in the eye and say, “ Yeah I stole it. And I regret nothing”.<br />And you’ll be totally cool with it. So, yeah, it’s that comfy."

5.0,ordered one for myself and my wife. They work great.
5.0,Fits really nice
5.0,Holds plenty of cards. Nice design. Holds up nicely to falls. Easy to get the apple tag into.
5.0,"Loved this top. I ordered a small which is typically the size I wear in everything and it fit perfectly before I watched it, but because it is cotton it did shrink a little in the wash. It still fits okay, but not as well as before. I would recommend going one size up for this reason. Other than that it is great, I love how long it is (both before and after washing)"
5.0,I wore this to Key West on a Sunset cruise.  I stopped counting the compliments after receiving 12.  The dress flows very well and is stunning.
5.0,"The pin arrived on time and in excellent condition. The pin depth is not too long, but deep enough for a cap or lapel."

5.0,"Very well made product, strongly suggest American buyers up size by two sizes."
5.0,Ordered these for a friend (size m). They were just amazing and the fit was just right.. already looking into ordering a few more
5.0,"Does what a watch band should do.  Ordered this one because it is an OEM part. Others are cheaper but I got what I paid for, a quality part."
5.0,"The bangle was absolute beautiful and well beyond my expectations. I don’t know how to evaluate the jade much, but I can easily judge by the clarity of the color and the translucent quality of the stone that this is well worth the price I paid. During the summer I traveled to Yunnan, China for sightseeing and as arranged by the tourist guide I visited some jade jewelers. I spent a lot of money on a few pieces of jade pendants and I thought I had made good bargains, until I bought and received this item. Now I know I really paid too much in Yunnan. I have placed more orders with Parma77 for the jade jewelry in different colors and qualities and will be paying attention to their new items marketed and I will buy more for my collection when I see things beautiful. I don’t have to worry about their prices because I think their prices are much better than all other sellers in China and on Amazon. Surely I hope my review will not lead to their raising the prices."
5.0,"I have two sisters, one older and one younger. I wanted something simply for Christmas for all of us to share. These are far from simple - they are Simply Beautiful. I know my sisters are going to love them as much as I do."

5.0,"It came undamaged and on time.  The fitting is really pretty and looks just like the image provided by seller.  I did have to pry  the bottom of it open, just a bit, so that I could get it to slide on my band. The fit is perfect now and looks lovely with all my different colored bands."
5.0,Bought this for a fellow military wife! She loved it. It looks just like the picture! Shipping was faster than expected.

5.0,"I. Love. These. Glasses.<br />When I first took them out of their box I wasn’t sure of how flattering they would be since I have a very long face and they’re larger than I had thought, but I love them. The blue glass is so fun and the frame isn’t flimsy."

For reference I am 5' 2"", very blessed in the chest and the medium fit beautifully!<br /><br />All in all amazing dress!  Highly recommend!"
5.0,My girlfriend really likes it
5.0,I purchased the Vietnam Veteran cap for my neighbor as a birthday gift.  He was one of thousands who served in the conflict.  The cap and design imprinted brought a smile to his face and tears to his eyes knowing their sacrifice was not forgotten.  Well done.
5.0,Cotton! Feels and looks great! Top part is stretchy so fits well though I'm 8 months already.
5.0,I love this bag because it's big enough to hold everything but most importantly because it stays on my shoulder when shopping.  I hate a purse that constantly falls off your shoulder and you have to re-adjust it every two minutes.
5.0,Great Product and great for the price
5.0,Got this for my child to wear as a Cosplay.  Instead they wear the shirt on a regular basis. They love this outfit.

5.0,great sweater
5.0,"Perfect for the child, that I ordered it for."
5.0,I have been wanting this handbag for quite some time.  But it either was not available at other places or only at the regular high price. Glad I now have it!  It is just the right size for going to dressier events and the black color gives it some elegance.  But it was a nice silky type bag to store the purse in.  I am satisfied with my purchase
5.0,just what we had in mind
5.0,Beautiful statement necklace!!! My sister-in-law loves this look. Not for petite and shy women.

5.0,Nice fit great quality!
5.0,"I like listening to relaxation tracks when I'm sleeping, and I've been looking for a good set of sleep headphones for a while. I came across these and decided to give them a try.<br /><br />I really like these sleep headphones. They're really simple to use. There are flat speakers in the headband that you can adjust to sit right over your ears. No, they're not secured in place, but once you put the headband on and position the speakers, they don't move around. But since they aren't sewn in place or anything, you can take them out to wash the headband. The speakers are flat, about 1/4&quot; thick, and are comfortable to lay on. I'm a side sleeper; I sleep on my right side and I don't usually move around that much, and these were comfortable all night. My ears didn't get sore or anything. The headband is fleece and it's really comfortable. I was a bit hesitant because I tend to get hot when I sleep, and I was worried that the fleece headband would cause me to sweat a lot, but I haven't had that problem.<br /><br />The sound quality is good for what I need these for. It's not concert-quality audio, but that's not what they're for! I did have to turn the volume on my mp3 player up a little bit, but that was expected. They're sensitive enough to pick up the nuances in sound in my relaxation tracks, which is all I could ask for. The cord comes out the back of headband, so it stays out of the way. The cord is long enough that I can plug it into my phone on the nightstand table. If you want to connect it to something farther away, you might want to look for a good audio extension cord (I recommend this one: [[ASIN:B014PRYW5W Stony-Edge Microphone/Headset/Headphone Audio Extension Cable for iPhone or Smartphones, 3.5mm TRRS Male to Female, 13 Feet]])<br /><br />Overall, I'm really glad I got these sleep headphones, they're definitely more comfortable than trying to sleep with headphones or earbuds! They're hardly noticeable, but deliver decent sound. I highly recommend them for anyone who wants to listen to relaxation tapes, white noise, or anything else while they're sleeping.<br />I received these sleep headphones at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review; however that has not influenced my rating in any way."
5.0,My husband just got a Vintage Jeep and he loved the hat!
5.0,"One of the things that I always have on me when I am out and about is my sunglasses. I think that I wear sunglasses more then I wear anything else. Having lots of pairs of these there are certain things that I look forward to when I get a pair of sunglasses, not only do they have to be comfortable but they also have to be fashionable and make is so that I can drive comfortably and without the sun impairing my vision.<br /><br />  CONTENTS: This package comes with one pair of all black sunglasses in the color black. This also comes with a case, microfiber cloth and a small screwdriver to repair glasses.<br /><br />  FRAMES: The frames on these glasses are a shape that I have come to love. The bigger eye pieces are quite in fashion and just remind me on the summer and the iconic look of some of the famous sex symbols that we are used to seeing. These frames are made well and are nice and sturdy even when they are getting put on and takes off all days long. One of the things that I love about the all plastic frames is that the nose pieces are molded into the plastic so there is no worry of the nose pieces irritating your nose or getting stuck in my hair when I pull them to the top of my head. The fact that the front of this frame is so big means that I got a lot of protection from the sun getting in my eyes which means that I was nice and secure that I could drive nice and safe.<br /><br />  I like the way that the glasses are made cause they have a great angle to them that almost hugs the face, this makes for not only a more comfortable fit but also gives a little bit more protection from the sun. The black color of these frames means that it went with almost anything that I was wearing, The legs of these glasses are what I would consider a medium width so that I can still look out the side of the glasses safely.<br /><br />  LENS: The lenses of these glasses are a little lighter than what I usually wear in the stronger sun but they are the best shade for putting on when it’s a more overcast day or even in the early evening where the sun is not at its stronger but yet you are like me and still like the added protection of the lenses. The lens are a nice lighter shade of black so the lenses go really well with the black in the frame as well.<br /><br />  BONUS’S: The case that comes with these glasses is one of the better cases that I have seen come with a pair of sunglasses. The leather type material closes with a snap closure and keeps the sunglasses nice and secure. The microcloth and the screwdriver are both good accessories to have when you have a pair of sunglasses.<br /><br />  OVERALL: These are a really good pair of sunglasses. Not only is the style of the glasses an iconic look but these are made well and work really well in a dimmer light. These would be great for anyone that just needs a cute pair of glasses and is looking for some that are always going to be in fashion.<br /><br />  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion.

5.0,Super soft and fit as expected.  I love it!
5.0,Very cute and higher quality than I thought it would be. Fit snug in the bum and Tummy if your kid has any fluff go a size up.
5.0,"Thin, slight stretch and a high waist. What more could I ask for? I love these jeans, and I am 5’4, 135lbs with thicker thighs and skinny ankles. These fit perfectly, and are both flattering and functional. The lace is very dainty, so I will be sure to hang these to dry after a wash, but I’m very particular about my jeans, and for $20, these were a steal! I’ll definitely be ordering the black ones."
5.0,Loved this dress so much I ordered 5 more dresses from this company all different styles and colors. Perfect for office wear
5.0,"Perfect in every way. Fixed elastic band attachment - so easy and reliable. Simply insert your business card into the ID section and you're ready to fly. Available in great, &#34;popping&#34; colors."
5.0,"Great purchase, so happy I didn't have to purchase a brand new pair of glasses, saved me plenty of money, thanks"
5.0,A gorgeous dress indeed. I love it
5.0,"My grandfather had a similar watch before he passed away. This watch reminds me of him. The window for the date and day is clear and big enough to see without straining your eyes. I wear this watch in the office and it goes with everything. Also, the watch has a professional look for a great price."
5.0,Beautiful cuff!  I am impressed with the workmanship.  It is pleasantly bigger than I excepted.  I ordered more . . . .
5.0,Loved them they are the exact same ones that sell on crocs website except only cost 1/3 the price and they are NOT jibbitz replicas they are official!
5.0,I paired it with some distressed jean shorts and got lots of compliments.  LOVE it!!
5.0,Never got so many compliments on sunglasses ever! Love them!! Super classy and fun.
5.0,Great fit.  Hugs the right parts and skims the bad parts.<br /><br />Do note however that the colour runs - my nails where blue after a day of wearing.  After second wash and wear and the colour is still rubbing off.  Suggest you hand wash this on it own or wash it with dark colours.
5.0,will definitely buy more
5.0,Great fit was nice and roomy. Great for the perfect beach day.
5.0,"Great sunhat, good quality cotton!"
5.0,"I love the feel of the material which is light weight and it’s beautiful, comfortable."
5.0,beautiful band
5.0,"Bought for a race day at Del Mar. Super chic. Very comfortable to wear, stayed on in light wind (fits with a head band)."
5.0,The colors are so beautiful!!! Love my birthday dress!
5.0,Perfect fit. Like the zip up plus the Velcro<br />Closures ...good to have the options.
5.0,Perfect size for front pocket or add to small purse.
5.0,"i loved it so much. true to it’s size. would very much recommend to others to buy! i stacked it on top of a sliver band. i’ve also had it for a couple weeks now and it doesn’t rust or turn your skin green. it also doesn’t bend. it’s still sliver and in great shape. the only thing that confused me was how small it was (thickness), which is why i decided to stack mine. other than that i love it!"
5.0,sister loves it
5.0,I absolutely love my purse! I received a lot of compliments! Many thanks to the creator of this beauty! Very classy and the price was pretty reasonable! Will definitely order more colors!!!
5.0,"I love linen unconstructed blazers and they have been impossible to find.  My old one died and I have been looking for at least 2+ years.  This one seems very much like my last one.........colour is good, fit is perfect for what I like, and it goes with all of the same pants as the last one.  I would have never suspected covered buttons however which gives it a more expensive look.  Don't let the term ""shoulder pads"" deter you as they are just enough to give it shape."
5.0,"This was a great gift to my wife, she loves it!"
5.0,"I purchased this watch for my husbands 50th birthday. The quality was outstanding!! Not only the watch itself, but the box it came in, how it was packaged inside and the watch being completely protected with plastic.  Top notch. My husband easily corrected the sizing without having to take it to a jeweler."
5.0,great quality! Fast shipping!
5.0,"These sunglasses are amazing, well packaged in a quality case and cloth, with a eyeglass screwdriver, Very well made, and fast shipping, im going to order another pair for my other car!"
5.0,"I am outside a lot in all kinds of weather conditions. This hat works as advertised! I also wear it during light summer rain showers. Overall very good product, I am very pleased with my purchase. This hat, a cooling towel, electrolyte drink/water, and I am good to go on my adventures. I’ll tip my hat to you when I see you wearing one of these."
5.0,"I bought these shoes for my nephew and crossed my fingers that the lights would work upon arrival (since some reviews had issues with that). Luckily, they worked perfectly. My nephew absolutely adores the shoes and asks to wear them all over the place. My sister is thrilled, because there's no struggle whatsoever to get him to sit still for putting on shoes.<br /><br />It's been about a month since they received the shoes, and I'm told the lights are still working perfectly. Given that kids grow out of shoes pretty quickly, I'm hopeful they'll last until he grows out of them - or at least until Halloween. The lights are great for a bit of added safety as they take him trick or treating in the dark."
5.0,"I am an adult women with small hands, but I ordered a size medium and they fit just right.  The colors (navy/salmon) are very nice. I've used them for several weeks and love them."
5.0,I’m a female tennis player & a Rafa by fan. I like the fact it was pink.
5.0,"Love it , love it, love it."
5.0,"Very happy -- looks great, good value."
5.0,Great Sunglasses and beautiful
5.0,Expectations were met
5.0,These cubes were great quality and fit our needs for a 3-week trip! We were able to take smaller suitcases. Excellent!
5.0,I am a big charm collector so when I seen this I knew I just had to get it. It is so nice and unique it is totally worth it. You can put it on a necklace or bracelet or anything you would like. It looks perfect on and is such a nice unique charm to add to my collection. I am glad I was able to find one. It is a good quality piece that is looks stunning with everything. It is a nice playful and fun charm.<br />Great shipping and packaging.<br />I purchased this product for a reduce price to make an honest and unbiased review.
5.0,I bought this dress for the holidays. I was looking for something sexy & classy. The velvet is soft & I like how you can adjust the length. It fit perfectly and I got so many compliments on it! It has held up after multiple washes. Definitely recommend!
5.0,"These goggles work great for the price! They seal very well, works great with glasses, and they resist fogging (so far)."
5.0,"I love the design and multiple stones, and the fact they used sterling silver.<br />It arrived as promised on time and in a small box.<br />The earrings were a little smaller and colors not as dark as I expected."
5.0,"This is the second item I brought from them, I love these leggings!"
5.0,These may be the best shoe laces I have ever seen.  They are well made and look like they will last a long time.  It is unusual to be impressed with something to simple as a shoe lace but these are impressive.
5.0,"Perfect fit on my 1 3/8 ratchet belts that had broken buckles. This is way less expensive than buying whole new belts. The belt end slides right in and the belt gripping teeth close tight and hold solid. The ratchet side looks and works just like the original buckles. The buckles are finished nicely and look good with the white background and metal accent. One in gold, one in silver."
5.0,"Very nice,  felt wonderful.  Good quality."
5.0,Perfect length for my height
5.0,"This dress is amazing! Its soooo beautiful! It is the perfect size, the material is comfortable and I love the color. I am in love!"
5.0,Love it fast shipping
5.0,"Note: this is not a full size mouse! I bought this without reading the description enough, thinking it was a full size mouse. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived almost a week before the first date in the range. The size of the mouse isn't actually very nice for light laptop use and is definitely better than a trackpad!!"
5.0,"Love it, exactly how I wanted it!!!"
5.0,I bought these for my granddaughters birthday.  She loves them.
5.0,I bought two for my 9-year-old to give to her friends. One is a friend she's known for quite some time and the other is much more of a new friend.  She has one silver for the new friend and the gold for the old friend. This is from her Girl Scout song!
5.0,Great price for familiar product.
5.0,Cute designs
5.0,Nothing not to like except it uses fuel if you happen to let it burn for hours. The best way to use a diffuser  is to burn for an hour the scent fills the space and lasts for hours without using up you’re oil.
5.0,"Have used almost daily all summer and it’s great. Smelled weird at first, but the washing machine fixed that."
5.0,"A good price and good quality. They are thin and a little sheer, but I don't expect them to rip. I would buy again if there were more colors!"
5.0,Perfect Christmas gift. Perfect fit by size chart. Soft. Great material. Our 10yr old loved them.
5.0,"Beautiful box, certificate of authenticity, cute little gift bag, and the bracelet! The color is beautiful!"
5.0,I love this Center and so does many of my customers.
5.0,The watch is beautiful!  It's a little heavier than I thought it would be and the clock face is about the size of a man's watch...but it really stands out and that is so cool in a bracelet watch...sometimes they're too dainty.
5.0,"Beautiful. Sturdy, very well made. Holds plenty for overnight or a weekend away. I love the strap in the back as it fits over my spinner bag handle without slipping. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. Roomy with plenty of pockets. I had never heard of this brand (I do not travel that much) but recommend it highly. I cannot speak to this fitting under a seat on a plane as I usually drive or more recently, travel by train. I would think the dimensions of the bag at least would fit in an overhead compartment if not under a seat. Again, it is a quality item and am pleased with the purchase."
5.0,Fits as expected....very cute
5.0,Great fit and High Quality.  What else can you ask for :)
5.0,"with NYC jumping on the ""get rid of plastic bags"" train, I was happy to buy these and now use them to go grocery shopping.  They are BIG and STURDY and usually I only need 1 to carry all my groceries.  I've definitely tested their durability and can confirm they will last just fine when filled to the top.  Well made!"
5.0,"I loved the color, and the feel of this pajama set! Very comfortable and stretchy. I would recommend!"
5.0,Really fun!
5.0,"My fav socks by far. Thin, but who cares about comfort when you have freakin Wolverine on your feet?!?!"
5.0,"Use every day. Holds business card, credit carts, money and receipts."
5.0,I got these like a year ago. I have had mine hooked onto my car/house keys since the day I got them. My son has chewed on them threw them TONS of times. They have never came unhooked from other keys. Pics NEVER came out. The back only came off a pic 1x and that was because my son was trying to get it off. He got it halfway off and threw them onto the ground outside and it came off. But the pic didn't come out. U can hear if it falls. I still have the 2nd one I ordered. Have not had to use it yet. Very durable. If I could give more stars I would. Lol
5.0,Loved them they fit a little loose but they look good and cute.
5.0,Excellent. Fix .
5.0,"Awesome, A+++++"
5.0,"Graduation during a global pandemic was getting my niece down, so sad about all the things she was missing out on,  this cap and gown helped ease that sadness. Great quality, way nicer than mine from graduation years ago. Thick quality material and great shipping time! Thank you for redeeming one part of a crazy 2020 high school graduation!"
5.0,"Bought this for a friend as a gag.  Got a big laugh, and was much appreciated.  Would absolutely recommend for the price."
5.0,"My Citizen Battery ran out and I needed to send it to for service. I found this Burei brand which I was unfamiliar with in the past. I was very reluctant initially to buy this watch given that its price is quite low and I was concerned that it would be poor quality. However, after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I'm actually surprised by the good built quality of this watch and it would easily look like a $200-300 dollar watch. There is nothing in this price range that could give you this high quality. It also included Sapphire glass which is scratch resistant. I have to say that the wrist metal is somewhat easy to scratch, but so was my previous Tissot and Citizen. I've had it for 2 weeks now and will update the review if I get any surprises. I'm very satisfied with this watch."
5.0,I’ll never lose sight of my keys.
5.0,This was a gift for a grown son.  He was happy with the quality and sizing.
5.0,High quality sweater. I gets lots of compliments on the blue. I came back and ordered a black one. Both are great!
5.0,"Doves are really cute. 2 in the order.  Great price. Fast shipping,  too."
5.0,"I bought these earrings for my 9 year old daughter. We have tried 14k gold, 18k gold, sterling silver, nickel free, etc. They all hurt and irritate her ears. She has been wearing the titanium earrings for 3 days and her ears are totally fine!! Finally!! I highly recommend."
5.0,Great watch it just pop very eye catching I love this watch you really have to see for yourself watch came set with time and date thanks so much to Amazon
5.0,I love it. It's perfect. I'm 5'7 and have a medium.
5.0,Love the fit and feel of these<br />No more shrinking wife beaters for this guy<br />And especially like the length of these things
5.0,It's slightly big for my almost 12 week old but I'm happy about that as he can grow into it and can wear it many times!
5.0,"Love them, very comfortable"
5.0,My daughter has a little bit of a fat foot and these shoes fit really good on her.
5.0,Love the fit of these leggings. The lightweight material is great during the spring and summer months. I ordered these leggings to test out the brand and have now purchased multiple sets. Love all of the color options as well!
5.0,She wears them all the time.
5.0,"I had to write a review for this dress because I got SO many compliments on it at my bridal shower! I am a true size 16 and often have a hard time deciding between “regular” clothing and plus size items, but this was the perfect fit for me. I’m 5ft 7 wearing 3 inch heels if that helps anyone reference the length. It is a tad see-thru so I just wore a nude leotard under it and was so comfortable! The fabric is thin but it’s still a nice dress for winter with a coat."
5.0,"Great cooler weather work out/tennis top. I’m 5’4” and it just covers my rear. I usually wear a size small (size 4-6), but Head clothing can run a touch on the small side (I’d say their small is a 2-4) so I bought the medium. Re-ordered this for a few more colors."
5.0,"Love, love, love, love this! I was worried about it being way too short on me, but figured if it was it could go to my tiny daughter in law. BUT it fits great, so it's alll MINE! I love the fabric, super way soft and seems to be really good quality for a faux suede. The tie in the front make the size super adjustable and I absolutely love the style. Cannot wait till fall to throw this on with a pair of boots!"
5.0,These are SO beautiful I love this color especially! I lost one at a show but I still have the other I’ll mismatch! Love Kritter Klips!
5.0,"No bad smell appropriate size. This feels good. They are made in China but most items, medical supplies, medicines included come from China and India today.  So this doesn't bother me in the least like it seems to bother so many other people. Maybe things will change in the future and then people can opt to be selective of where goods come from But for now it is what it is. I will buy what I need to protect myself and my family no matter where it comes from."
5.0,So comfy. Bought them for post Parton care to wear with large sanitary pads. These worked like a charm and even though my post parfumerie bleeding has stopped I’m still wearing them because I love them so much.
5.0,Looks just like the photo
5.0,Very nice Halloween mask. Reminds me of my childhood!
5.0,My wife's butt looks amazing in these shorts.
5.0,"Super cute dress, fit perfect!"
5.0,Nice and held all my keys
5.0,Kids love walking in these
5.0,Very pleased. These have a very intricate design of the US Navy seal.
5.0,It looks flawless
5.0,"These are my go to flip flops. As I suffer with planters fasciitis and love to wear flip flops, these are perfect. There is added cushioning to accommodate and support the arch. Plus, they are not flat like the cheap flip flops which adds a bit of style."
5.0,Nice quality. Gave it to my husband and he's looking forward to organizing his keys. Stylish
5.0,This writer purchased for my 19 year granddaughter who is a full time college student for Valentine's day and she absolutely told me she loves it!<br />Great style and quality for the price.
5.0,This is so comfortable and sexy. This will be my regular going out dress now.
5.0,"gradient, brown and lightweight. These ae perfect from tee, to green.....replaced in my Oakley's...."
5.0,Bracelet is very cute and real 925 silver. Very elegant to wear with mostly anything. Would recommend if you’re like me a silver lover.
5.0,Husband loves his backpack and great quality!
5.0,"I wore this dress for my senior prom. Best decision ever, absolutely love this dress. I have no regrets. Everyone thought my dress was custom made.<br />But I suggest using their sizing chart provided. They packaged the dress very well and on time delivery."
5.0,Product looks great!  Hopefully the wife will like it!
5.0,A little longer than what my daughter wanted it to be but fit right. My daughter is a y’all and slim. Wears a size Large and the Large was just fine.
5.0,Look like bagels😊
5.0,I bought this as a gift and the recipient was very happy with the fit and the color.
5.0,Great product .
5.0,Great bag.  Holds everything I need!  Stands up and enough pockets.
5.0,"This dress is absolutely sexxy, trendy, fabulous for us women with curves. This dress will definitely flaunt it. I love it! It's a very soft, clingy, stretch material. And to really make the dress stand out add a simple waist belt or dress it up with a cute jacket . The possibilities are literally endless."
5.0,Very light weight. Holds color well. There are holes at the end of horn where I put hair clips inside it to clip it on my wig to make it look more natural rather the having to put it on a head band. Great for costume prop.
5.0,loved these... they were super comfortable and got compliments all over :)
5.0,I did not expect the quality to be as good as it is! each mask is nicely packed which makes it great as a gift! Very happy with purchase.
5.0,"The earrings are wonderful and they arrived very quickly, with a thank you from the vendor handwritten.<br />A very nice touch."
5.0,"I am really pleased with this facial steamer. Very simple to use. I appreciate that it has a short cord for safety. The instructions are complete but will require a magnifying glass, at least for me.  In my younger years I had oily skin. In my senior years I do have large pores and occasional blackheads. What really works for me is to use the steamer to open my pores and then apply a facial mask that removes blackheads. Works great and face looks smoother. Great product. Also be careful to notice that only purified or distilled water should be used."
5.0,I love this shirt! The material is solid and quality! I have washed it many times it has little fading and the design perfectly intact! I would highly recommend this product
5.0,"I  received this item at a discount for y honest review, this are for my daughter who loves to play on the pool, the googles work great sealing perfectly the water and giving you a more natural clarity under the water, she loved it,"
5.0,All kids love these. We put oils on them so they always get the benefits of the oils. I can was these too.
5.0,These where good adjustable glasses for my 7 yr old. Not to big for the face.
5.0,New to readers. This is the best pair I have

5.0,Le doy 5
5.0,Great quality at a great price!
5.0,"Very well made and great looking tie. Looks like I spent much more. The great thing is that this tie has a kind of rugged look that can be dressed up or down. The color was spot on too. Don't hesitate, great buy!"
5.0,Really enjoying these so far.
5.0,"Purchased this for a great-grandson who swims daily.. He loved it because it was  very 'soft' and we only had to put sunscreen on his face, lower arms and legs. If he is happy, I am delighted. Perfect transaction!"
5.0,"great looking, good material"
5.0,excellant watchband
5.0,"So much fun to wear along  with my t-shirt... be calm and hug a dog,  combined with puppy paw temporary tattoos."
5.0,A little expensive.
5.0,"The sizing is a bit tricky on this &#34;skirt&#34; however I was able to pull it up past my hips and up to my Bikini top with no problems. With that being said, I'm 4'11 so the only way I could wear it lower and be able to walk is to either hem the bottom or figure out a way to make it work.<br /><br />I'm normally a size MED or 6-8 US sizes. Knowing this was coming from a chinese made site w/chinese sizing... I bought the XL and it was just right. Go a size up from your norm and it should work."
5.0,I love these!  They fit great.  They look nice.  They keep my head warm.  Wash on cold-delicate and timed dry on delicate low heat and they hold up perfectly.
5.0,i like this beanie because it kept my head nice and warm in the snow. :)

5.0,See header
5.0,This shades are awesome look exactly like the picture and the matte finish is nice!
5.0,I have been wearing this style of  Chantelle bra for years and years. Nordstrom  stopped caring this style. That is were I used to buy this bra. So I went on a hunt to find where I could buy it. To my delight I found it on Amazon. It is also available on the Chantelle web site. But you have to pay for shipping unless you spend at least $99. If you can find it on Amazon buy it.  This is the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.  I love the round shape it provides to your bust line too. I find this bra is the best tee shirt bra ever
5.0,Zero complaints! Love the style and they hold up well for someone who doesn’t treat her sunglasses well :)
5.0,very comfortable provide support and you don't really realize the are on!!!  I really like the fit
5.0,Love them. Also came with a gift! Thank you so much. Wish I could give you more then 5 stars!
5.0,Everything was acceptable
5.0,I was surprised at the quality of this dress for the price! Looked very classy on and extremely comfortable!
5.0,"Measure your bra hooks! Seriously this takes less than a minute to do and will help you determine what size to get. I measured and ordered 2 different pairs, and both fit great. Exactly what I was looking for and I'm surprised that they even stay on through the wash."
5.0,"Love this ring hasn't turned my finger green, but order a size bigger they run small."
5.0,Very comfortable lounging clothes
5.0,The hat is so warm. It also covers your ears and neck.
5.0,"I'm very pleased with how pretty and sparkly this watch is. I wish I knew someone who needed a watch, I'd buy another one as a gift. I have a large wrist and it fits well."
5.0,"very pretty, looks real enough to keep creepy guys away, which is a plus. will turn your finger green if you wear it for too long though."
5.0,Super cute not too small not too big!
5.0,They were not all the same size
5.0,"You do have to take your time putting them on, but fit was great once on. I think these will really help with long road trips."
5.0,"Love these bags!!  I use them for everything!!!  When I shop at the grocery store and farm, people always notice them and tell me how much they like them."

5.0,Beautiful dress and live the way it fits on me!
5.0,The tiger started to fade after one wash. But it’s great thanks
5.0,He didn't want to take it off. Hes 6 so it was a little too long the sleeves for him a little too big I order him a medium size i should had gone with a small but then again the grow too fast!
5.0,Works well for trail or bike.
5.0,I am in love with this bag. At first I was unsure of this bag because it was so different but that is what I Love about it. It is listed as a shoulder bag but I find it easier to carry on the arm. It comes with a long strap but it looks better without it. It is extremely spacious and a lot of organization. The neat thing about this bag is how it opens. Nothing like I havr seen before. It has studded feet and a key fob. The hardware is well made and the saffiano leather is easy to keep clean. I received many compliments on how cute this bag looks and I just added a pom pom on the side.
5.0,Good color. Good quality. Husky Purple.
5.0,Ordered 3t. It is a little long. Also it doesn’t come with a headband you have to buy it seperate.<br />My daughter loves the dress. It is well made. The wings are super cute and stay on very well.
5.0,Very nice looking and comfortable. Great price.
5.0,I just love this  black headband. It is not tight on your head and does not give you a headache. The neutral color is a nice addition to your accessories. This can be worn several different ways which makes it very versatile! I always like too keep my hair out of my face. The material is super soft with spandex material in it. This headband does not need to be repositioned all day long. I woul recommend this head band too anyone it is a quality headband.<br />I received this a a discounted price for a honest opinion.
5.0,"These fit just right, totally cute and comfy. Order 1/2 size up"
5.0,I love this dress! I expected it to be too small or tight but it fit perfectly! we'll see how it holds up over a few washes but so far so good
5.0,5 stars light weight soft and comfortable will buy another 3 pack
5.0,It's very nice for the price.  It can *almost* double as a wrap dress.  The green is lovely and it washes well.  I hang it to dry.
5.0,My 4year old daughter LOVES this leotard!
5.0,Kept me cool
5.0,Nice quality. Love it
5.0,Love this dress. It's very comfy and stylish. Got a lot of compliments! Would buy it again in different colors. I really wish they had this dress in maxi as well.

5.0,These are very pretty and the price was very reasonable.  Delivery was SUPER FAST!!!

5.0,"This was the perfect addition to my Mrs. Frizzle costume for Halloween! It looks way more expensive than it is and my students just loved it. My absolute only complaint is that Saturn is one sided so often it just lays and is a solid gold color, so i wish it was a two sided bead, but not a big deal!"
5.0,"Overall I really like Stay Puft, but it needs more weight in the bottom, and it should really come with 4 stakes and tie downs."

5.0,Just Perfect
5.0,I go about6'4 285. I got a 3xl and the jacket was as perfect a fit as you would expect.  The quality is good enough. It's a good riding jacket for cooler fall days. I don't see it as nice enough to wear as a fashion item. But it's comfortable and serves the purpose for the price point. Very happy w the purchase
5.0,My girl says they’re really soft

I thought it looked eh when i got it out of the packaging but I was then surprised when i put it on :)

5.0,I could find nothing to dislike about this top
5.0,"I broke my ankle and had two surgeries and need compression socks dailt to prevent severe swelling in my foot and leg, so I nwed strong compression that doesn't loosen after a few hours of wear. These are the best compression socks I've tried! They're super cute, and have plenty of compression to keep my ankle from swelling. They do stretch out a bit eventually, but I have worn them every day for the last several months and they have only lost a tiny bit of compression ability. I can wear them for several hours on my feet without them losing effectiveness.<br /><br />They do leave little imprints on my skin from the pattern when I take them off, but it doesn't hurt, and is actually pretty amusing.<br /><br />Tip: if you have severe swelling issues, lie down for 15 minutes or so before taking them off. Or just keep them on until you go to bed. This way there is no rebound swelling when you remove the compression."
5.0,"I bought this earrings for my wife, who is looking for some new eye-catching jewelry. With Amazon jewelry is hit-or-miss, but this one was an excellent choice. The size is larger than anticipated; you can see in my picture that the large circle is bigger than a quarter! The colors in the earrings are brighter than the Amazon picture, and the stones shine brightly in good light.<br /><br />Overall, these is a very beautiful and visible pair of earrings that will match perfectly with my wife's summer dresses. However, if you are looking for something subtle/discrete, this will probably be over sized.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I got an 80% discount in these earrings in exchange for an honest review. I have bought many discounted necklaces and earrings in exchange for honest reviews, and I have no problem in giving low scores for those items that are not good. Some of the other items we have reviewed (and loved) are:<br />- [[ASIN:B00GTYAZ2Y Sparkling Yellow Colored Heart Shaped Clover Charm Necklace 224]]<br />- [[ASIN:B00YBKXVFQ eManco Handmade Woven Rope Alloy Tassel Pendant Rhinestones Choker Collar Necklace Yellow]]"

5.0,"I am pleased!  It's like a knitted visor but large enough to cover your ears.  You can wear your ponytail exactly where you want to, high on the top of your head or low on the nape of your neck, not like those other hats/caps where your pony has to be just so.  So Cute and Cool!"

5.0,"The design, and the build of this watch band exceeded my expectations. I used this to replace a band on a watch I bought for my wife.  The quick release spring allows a single watch to accommodate many color ensembles, by changing the color of the band.  The buckle is the ideal rose gold tone for many women's watches with rose gold.  Classy look.  Great price."
5.0,WORKED AS EXPECTED
5.0,Absolutely love these lounge shorts.  The fit is perfect. They are loose enough to feel comfortable but not dowdy. They are also not too short or ride up your backside.

You must get the matching lounge top for total comfort and style.

5.0,"I ordered this shirt for my husband to wear when we renew our vows July 31st in Kauai this year. He wears an xl. I was very concerned about it fitting with all the mixed reviews of some saying it was too small, order one size bigger or two sizes bigger, some said two sizes still wasn't big enough. I just looked at the size chart, measured my husband and went with a triple x, not thinking about people saying they send another size bigger than what you order, because triple x was the biggest size they had to order. When I received it,  it was a quadruple x! But it was perfect! Not sure if it depends on the color you purchase as to the sizing, but I bought a white shirt. So get several sizes bigger if ordering this shirt in white."
5.0,My daughter loves this umbrella. It is very sturdy and easy to use even by a kid.
5.0,Delivered as exoected and looks as illustrated.

5.0,the size is exactly what it shows.
5.0,Fit nice super soft and super cool looking
5.0,"Love it !!<br />I have a hard time keeping my sunglasses and cheater glasses close to me.  I put them down and lose track of them.  I recently bought a motorcycle and thought this might be perfect instead of buying the chain to hang my glasses around my neck.  It arrived in a timely fashion, looked just like it was supposed to and looks great on my vest.  It has the symbol that is dear to my heart which makes it more special.  It holds my glasses in place, close to me, I can find them easily and they are not broken in my pocket or purse even driving down the highway.<br />I recommend any item from Guardian Bell."
5.0,"Loved the dress.  Flattering, fit and flare.  Twirly skirt was fun to dance in.  I did melt the skirt while steaming it.  It is a thick, funky fabric as others said."

5.0,Runs small order a 1-2 size larger than you normally wear. Mine is a little tight so I am loosing weight for the use. The suit is a great buy for the money.
5.0,"Pretty, but they appear more gold, than rose gold.  Which wouldn't be a problem for most people, but I usually wear silver jewelry, & have just started to wear some rose gold.  The tree design is stunning though.  If you love gold jewelery, you will love these earrings."

I am on my feet a lot of the day, and I stumbled across these shoes when looking for something that could help with my Plantar Fasciitis in my left heel, and these did the trick.

5.0,Love this dress so much I ordered it in red! Super cute and steal of a deal!
5.0,"I've had several of these over the years. They don't last forever, but are pretty durable in general. Love the day/date feature. My main requirement for a watch is that I can see the time at a glance, even in less-than-optimal lighting conditions."
5.0,Product is as advertised. Good quality.Shipped quickly.
5.0,"Arrived early and looks great! It's super soft. I will say I expected the material to be a little thicker but that's not necessarily a con since it's not for everyday wear lol<br /><br />I'd seen reviews saying it ran small so I ordered one size up. It's a smidgen big  utility nothing noticeable. Based on the material and how it's designed, I could see how it may run a little small."
5.0,The grandkids (and their moms) were very happy with this gift.  Can be used to buy veggies at the market instead of using plastic.
5.0,OMG !!!!!!! so pretty not a thing wrong everything is great

5.0,I bought this for a gift. I will tell you that it seemed to be a very good quality and a good buy for the money.
5.0,"For years I always Searched for Eye-sting holders that worked for me with out luck, always some little annoying issue that I hated so I went with out.  Now years later I came across this brand that advertised it's longer length and that sold me right then and there, but after getting them everything else they advertised became a reality for me.  I have expensive Sunglasses as well as Safety glasses for my workshop let alone my reading glasses and these Eye Strings fit easily on  the varied types of Glasses that I always wear from Reading-Hunting-Driving-Boating etc. Their long enough so they don't  HANG  like a bib around a man's neck and still offer ease of use and fit all my varied types of eye wear that I use  yet they weren't annoying to my neck and my eye wear was secure even in the water.  I like the color assortment and of course the price-point  for the quality I felt great value which surprised me.  But the main thing is for me,  ""THEY JUST DID THE JOB"""
5.0,"The best sports bra, for an amazing price! Amazing quality, tts, and super affordable! Love this sports bra!"
5.0,Perfect layering top
5.0,"Flowy and beautiful. A little bit see-through, So you will definitely have to wear a white tank top underneath. Goes perfect with anything. Does not come with the necklace."
5.0,The cutest darn dress 👗!!
5.0,"Really cute. Very soft fabric, not too thick and not too thin. Isn’t too fitted but with the belt, adds some shape to the body of the tunic/dress. I am wearing with leggings. I love the asymmetrical hem and the button detailing. For reference, I’m 135 and 5’. Hits above the knee on me."
5.0,Reasonably priced and not to heavy. Seam to be decently made.
5.0,Love this! It was perfect at the pool. Comfortable & light
5.0,"Flexible frames made it an instant hit w/ my 1 yr old -- lenses seemed to hold up well under kiddie duress as well.  Wish it came with a glasses leash to help them stay on his head, but who's kidding whom - he'd pull them off in a hot second anyways.  When they are on, they look great though!"
5.0,My Fiancee love this shirt &#34;me too&#34;<br />I wrt yoo 1 size it fit great
5.0,"You'll love to show your Magic Bean Svarsovski Element to all your friends. You'll happy you bought it, too. They're tasteful and colorful and delicate and inexpensive, too.<br />This is a good buy, too."
5.0,Love it! Thought it was going to be a thinner fabric but it is actually lined with fleece. It is very well made and great quality. The only thing I am changing is the hem line. I am 5'9&#34; and it is held way down my calf. I have included pictures of before and after hem change. Way to long! But other than that I love it 😍
5.0,"This was a gifted to a family member, and they love it.  It's worn on a regular basis."

5.0,"Arrived on time , fit my 4 year old well"
5.0,Love how it sparkles !
5.0,"For me these ran a little tight but they are super soft and comfy. They are thick enough not to be sheer and out walking in 85 degree weather, I didn't feel hot. Only thing though is be careful when washing them with something containing velcro - it grabs the fabric and messes it up."
5.0,"Just what I was looking for,  not too heavy.  Colors true to the images."
5.0,FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVES IT.
5.0,Everything is perfect about it
5.0,The was nice I bought them to use in my wedding. We decided not to us them . But I like them so will wear them some other time
5.0,I love this dress but the shoulder straps are too long. It is a bit big in the chest but I like loose fitting clothes. A few stitches on the straps and it will be good to go
5.0,"I have 26-27 inch big 'ol beautiful calfs. These fit perfectly!<br />UPDATE: I purchased these in May 2022 this is almost August. These bad boys are amazing! But my suggestion is to put them on as soon as you get moving in the morning because although they stilldo the job? It takes time.  I've even accidentally slept in them, they didn't bother me so that they strangled my legs.."
5.0,love this shirt. it's comfortable and fits perfectly
5.0,This green scapular of the Immaculate heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary is beautiful and well made. 10/10 would buy again.

5.0,"Got for my 3 year old granddaughter and decided they were better for my 9 year old granddaughter, she loves them"
5.0,"This purse is very pretty, looks expensive and the design is very nice. The only thing that I didn’t like is the strong smell ,smell like rubber. It def worth the price."
5.0,Love this cute outfit for the summer!
5.0,These shades are fantastic! They look good and helps block the sun's rays. Couldn't be happier. Yeh!
5.0,Person I bought it for was pleased
5.0,"The only problem, directions are difficult to decipher for all the functions to adjust. I had to “play” with the various pushers till I finally figured out all the settings. Directions could have been written easier to interpret."
5.0,"the item was really great I have to order a size up since I was expecting to fit a little lower around the waist, but it is a crop top so I was the one that was wrong so, if you like showing a little tummy this is a great shirt, it is soft and beautiful."

5.0,"At last, true to size fit."
5.0,received prompty and perfect for my husband
5.0,Really nice shirt I loved it true to size 👌
5.0,Cutest and stylish!
5.0,"These are a great orthopedic shoe for toddlers! They are so cute instead of not so attractive like a lot of orthopedic options. These shoes have a stiff heel, ankle and toe and a bit of arch support, but not as much as my daughter's other pair of orthopedic shoes which are the Bartek brand. That does make them more comfortable for her and they seem to be helping her gait, but I'm not sure how much they are lifting her flat foot. All in all they are an excellent option and we are very happy with the purchase."
5.0,Great seller. Product arrived on time and was as suspected
5.0,FIT FINE. THIS WAS FOR THE PIERCING FOR MIGRAINE HEADACHES AND WORKED WELL
5.0,This is a very nice product but the numbers were a little to large for the lady it was purchased for.
5.0,Thin padding on my shoulders is all I needed..
5.0,Awesome shirt! Love it!
5.0,"Sent the boy away to camp, packed 2 sweatpants, 2 sweatshirts, 4 pairs of shorts, 4 shirts, 6 pairs of sock, 3 bath towels and 4 face towels, toiletries and shower shoe. Used this so that when he wanted to wash clothes he could throw it all in this bag and wash it. Kept his items from getting lost. Very well made"
5.0,The best seersucker there is.
5.0,I get compliments every time I wear this dress. The pattern is great and it hugs in all the right places. Comfortable and beautiful. Goes well with red hair. I got the medium.
5.0,These are very cute and super versatile. They make the perfect accent to any low neckline or open collar. I easily added a large charm to the silver one and it looks even better.
5.0,"The quality is very nice. It is silk, very soft and as described- you will love it!"
5.0,The plugs came just like I thought they would. Polished and smooth amethyst plugs. The weight is decent and the delivery was handled in a timely manner. Would recommend!
5.0,"Omgosh it’s perfect, the lace flows as it should and it made well no complaints"
5.0,My kiddo an be I both love hunter x hunter so this is the PERFECT man for us to share even though I originally bought it for her.  Hahaha
5.0,"Love this thing, very slim, holds all my cards. The magnet-- super strong it holds my keys on the outside of my jeans."
5.0,"I bought this apron as a costume piece for my daughter. She's 5""2 and a size 6. The apron isn't exactly plus sized, but is a fantastic style for a historical recreation. Also, ""white"" is not white, more of a pale taupe, but worked perfect for stage lights!"
5.0,Very comfortable and light! Excellent buy.
5.0,"These boots fit nicely. The platform style is sturdy and I love the height  it gives!  This is my second pair, since I wore my last ones out!  Super fun necessity to my wardrobe."

5.0,"I purchased one for each of my three sons. It was not expensive but is very sturdy, attractive and came nicely packaged. Very authentic."
5.0,Love the shoe however it was nearly a size larger than the same shoe I ordered in black and the same make. I also had this problem from another vendor when ordering the shoe in white. Perfect comfort is the shoe fits though and would highly recommend but do be careful with the size and make sure you have Prime for free returns if needed.
5.0,Great gifts
5.0,Cute little charms!
5.0,This dress is well-made. The smocking is nice quality as is the material and choice of accent colors.
5.0,This was purchased for a gift and it was great quality. The shirt was perfect and the color was on point! Would definitely buy again from this vendor.
5.0,I added this to my medical alert bracelet. It's nice looking and just big enough that it's noticeable without being to obnoxiously big.
5.0,I was very surprised by how pretty this was. The quality is good. I use it as a decoration I hang from my rear view mirror. It doesn’t glow very well but as is it’s very nice.
5.0,Light weight and comfortable. Size 12. I am hard on boots as I do not drive and only ride a motorcycle. Time will tell.

5.0,Sometimes Celtic jewelry can be clunky or gaudy but this is feminine without being delicate. Love it. I wear it all the time. My only suggestion is to put on a silver chain. It’s too pretty for the rope
5.0,"Cute and perfect, it's came before time 😍😍☺️ buy it"
5.0,Light and soft used as a bathing suit cover up
5.0,not to be use as a dog collar... for fluffy hated it
5.0,Do not leak or fog!  Extremely nice

5.0,It's beautiful bracelet<br />Like that it has a life time protection plan<br />Thanks<br />M Traylor<br />Tyler texas

5.0,"I totally love it 🥰<br />Good quality, nice message.<br />Me encantaaaaa<br />Buena calidad y excelente mensaje en el interior."
5.0,Soft and shiny
5.0,Just what I was looking for. Flexible semi-hard plastic that isn't difficult to put into ears. Very pleased!
5.0,they have actually held up for a really long time and are really comfortable. i wear them with my rose gold pandora earings and they look like the same metal and crystals.
5.0,"I was looking for a change from my regular, solid bands. I’m glad I chose these. They are fun, go with many different outfits, and are comfortable. I do note that they seem shorter than my usual M/L bands, but it’s possible I ordered or received the wrong size. They still fit with room. Highly recommend."
5.0,The Blue and Green are brighter than pictured but  very pretty . I do not like especially vibrant bright  colors  but if you do then the green  and blue one is for you.. I will give one away  as a gift. I do like the black one though- it is perfect. B+Nice combo of color and perfect size. Very versatile.  Took awhile to get here but that was expected.  Price was good and the quality is what I paid for and expected.  They are nice & I will wear them.
5.0,"I received the dress yesterday.  I normally wear a Sz20/2x. I ordered the 3x.  Love the fit. Not too tight. The material is wonderfully soft and the pockets are a plus. : )<br />I rate it a 5 star, but would rate it 6 star if it were about 1-2 inches longer.<br />It goes right to the knee, but I like my dresses a little bit longer.<br />I still look forward to wearing it."
5.0,Love everything about these! Perfect and great price!
5.0,Gave it to my 10 year old kid to get him to start keeping track of time. He's always wearing the watch everywhere and loves it. It's been durable even after getting wet. He hasn't had any complaints about it. I like that he hasn't lost it yet and if he does it was cheap enough that it won't really upset me.
5.0,Great material in cold<br />My 2019 cold went in it.
5.0,Gift for my Niece and she loved it.
5.0,Very comfortable! Love it! My favorite new shirt!
5.0,As nice as gowns costing much more. Washed beautifully.
5.0,"I have been having very painful ankles and top of my arches, and just above my toes.  My Dr. suggested compression socks.  I have tried them and they felt like rubber bands after awhile.  I went on line and found these.  I figured if they didn't work out for me, my daughters would use them as they are on their feet a lot.  WELL, they didn't get them.  I can not believe how much they helped me.  No pain all day.  When I take them off at night, I do get a slight ache, but no pain.  These fit and compress exactly where I need them to.  I am going to reorder.  If you are having problems with your lower foot, ankles down these socks are just wonderful."
5.0,These are superb.  My feet never felt better and I have been wearing professional orthotics for about 13 years.  These are better by far.
5.0,I cant get my son out of it....
5.0,seems to work fine
5.0,"Really lovely, very pleased with this purchase! I ordered size small and it's just right though none too generous ~ sounds off, but the sleeves are a bit short so I end up compulsively pushing my sleeves up forearms in reaction. No big deal! Fabric is nicely weighted and very soft on the interior. I absolutely recommend! I purchased pink/grey/charcoal version and have worn this in springtime on repeat. If ordering for winter, I might size up for extra comfy factor. But you do you!"
5.0,ordered much larger as it's 100% cotton- after a wash- it fits perfectly!
5.0,Great light weight and easy to breath through. Love the way you can have them around your neck and pull it up when you meet someone. Also good to keep the sun off your neck.
5.0,It looked blue in the picture maybe im sligtly color blind haha fits as expected great product
5.0,Love Uno de 50 jewelry!
5.0,They are beautiful and perfect size
5.0,This was bought for our son. He likes it. Awesome deal and fast shipping
5.0,I love this jacket. I was a little unsure if it would fit but it’s perfect!
5.0,Bought these for my younger brother & his girlfriend and it was the perfect gift! Something small but meaningful! Very cute especially for people who aren’t too material and very good material as well. Doesn’t have to just be for couples either! I enjoyed also how much it costs for the set & I liked how fast it came in but I have Amazon prime which I can also recommend
5.0,"These are incredible. I'm a huge raver and glover, and these blew my mind. I've put on kaleidoscope or diffraction glasses before at a show, but this one is where it's at. The effect is perfect for looking at a stage. Highly reccomend, also they fit great! I'm in love 💙"
5.0,"Bra shopping is the WORST, especially sport's bras.  I can go through 50 and leave empty-handed and hating myself.  22 - 16 years ago I breastfed 3 little soul-sucking biters for 2 years apiece.  Today, they are strong, strapping young men too self-absorbed to call, respect, or even like their mother.  As a consequence, I have been left with nothing but saggy, floppy windsocks.  So - WORTH IT!!<br /><br />All kidding aside I am more than pleased with this bra and I am immediately purchasing a second and maybe a third.  I might go a size up with the next one just to test it.  The fabric is very soft and smooth, it's tight like I prefer in the chest, and then it kind of relaxes as it goes up over your chest - no underarm boobs or back fat bubbles.  So it's tight enough to stop the flop but not so tight to be painful or annoying.<br /><br />The first thing I did after putting it on was jumping jacks.  I liked that it holds you in as it pushes you up and together instead of smashing you flat as a board.  I got the tiniest jiggle but nothing slipped out or flopped.  Can I get one of these for my belly fat???"
5.0,"Great fit, nice fabric and very affordable"
5.0,So very cute and at such a great price exactly what I was looking for ! I have the Ref watch so this print looks perfect and so comfy ! Get it !!!
5.0,It was exactly what was advertised
5.0,My son picked out this angle wing urn keepsake necklace for his grandmother’s ashes. He’s been wearing it for a couple of months and it’s held up great. Beautiful detail and well made.
5.0,"Very pretty and low key, great for an everyday earring. Also nice packaging. Comes in a padded box with travel bag."
5.0,I love that my toes are no longer squished in compression socks.  They are not too tight under the knee or at the ankle.<br />Make sure to measure your calf and go by the chart! My calves are wider than normal and I'm glad I got the size I did!
5.0,Love the colors. I was in this all day and almost slept in it. Great for a day party and dinner date.
5.0,really cool shoes
5.0,These glasses are wonderful... I was very pleased with the quality and fit. I like them so much I bought another set so I have spares.
5.0,My autistic son is obsessed with flags. He loves these socks.
5.0,Turned out better than the picture. Not as bright so to me it was perfect. Fits snug so it's not bulky and all the buttons are easy to press on the sides of the phone. Also fits with the glass screen protector. Great case for the price!!!!
5.0,"I love it. It is perfect. I am on the secretariat of our Cursillo and our prayers always begin with, ""Come Holy Spirit. "" It could not be more beautiful and appropriate for the body of Our Lord. I am so happy I chose it."
5.0,The style is great and  so comfortable
5.0,"Truly as described, butter soft, excellent quality, and fast delivery. Highly recommend."
5.0,I love the stretchy material. Fits great.
5.0,Great ring and great service.  I get a lot of positive comments about it.
5.0,I brought this as a lovely cover up and it fit perfectly. I am plus size and I usually purchase a 2xl size in shirts. My arms aren't small and it fit nicely not tight. The cover up looked very nice to dress up for Easter dinner. I would definitely purchase this item in other colors.
5.0,Peaky Blinders !
5.0,My daughter finds the nightmare before Christmas mask very comfortable easy to breathe I love the graphics
5.0,I love them they look just like the pic.
5.0,This fits perfectly and compliments my figure quite well! It's super soft too and doesn't dip too low on the chest.
5.0,This coin holder was just what I wanted. It displays the coin while keeping it protected on both sides behind clear plastic. The plastic is secured inside so there’s no shifting. Giving someone a coin to mark a milestone inserted into one of these holders makes a thoughtful and attractive gift. All 3 recipients were very pleased!
5.0,Boyfriend loved it! Wears it fishing a lot. Should not have gotten white 😂
5.0,"Bought as gift, recipient loved them"
5.0,Granddaughter loves this for dancing. So cute.
5.0,Perfect for our beach wedding
5.0,It was just what I was looking for. The color is a true match to the one I ordered!
5.0,I bought a small .. I’m 5’1 132 lbs ... the skirt is sheer I ordered white it’s more of a light silver with glitter it’s a good choice
5.0,One of my favorite suits!!! It fits great.
5.0,Very well made and solid wallet. It is small and able to still hold most of my essential cards/stuff. It is very versatile and I am extremely happy with my purchase. It is less bulky and fits in my jean pocket without being uncomfortable.
5.0,Great birthday present
5.0,Light weight & stretchy
5.0,Great price... Nice looking T shirt.. My son feels like a super model with it.
5.0,Love these sandals for my 18 month old. The light up feature is cute and they stay on his feet without chafing his ankle. The toe part is fabric so not uncomfortable for him.
5.0,"I was trying to match this necklace to a Rihanna look and this was a perfect fit! I love this necklace and it's a little smaller in person, which looked even better with my outfit."
5.0,"Seriously.....for the price it's terrific.  No concerns of losing it when out and about, yet it still looks good."
5.0,The material of the shirt is very soft and comfortable I ordered a large but I could've gotten away with a medium run a lil big on me.
5.0,"This hat is very cute. We love hats. It looks so nice on. It really is snazzy. It is also cute to have for special occasions or in pictures.<br /><br />Of course it is also functional. It can help block the sun. We have a strong sun here in Florida, so for us that is very nice.<br /><br />It is very comfortable to wear. It fits well on the head. It doesn’t feel hot or tight at all. It feels pretty light.<br /><br />The quality is pretty good. It seemed durable, too. It is flattering. I would recommend it."
5.0,This is one of my favorite shirts. I get so many comments on it. It is comfortable and fits as expected. I highly recomend.
5.0,Nice good pricre
5.0,"I love everything about this shirt. The material is amazing. The fit is perfect. The colors are exactly what I expected, they’re vibrant & just like the picture."
5.0,Bigger by at least 1 size compared to our other shoes but they will grow onto them.  The lights are great fun!
5.0,But I keep my truck key and remote separate from the ring. I have a lot of keys and I go hiking a lot and it's convenient to just take the truck keys with me. We all know how annoying it is to try to pry apart the rings and sometimes it goes too deep under the fingernail and hurts for a day or so. I sound like a baby but this is why I bought it. I just try to make sure I leave the rest of the keys in my truck.
5.0,Love the look and the fit!  Dress it up with a blazer and heels or go casual with sandals and a jean jacket.
5.0,Great purchase...I like the large size.

5.0,Love it so much I bought more colors!  Nice fabric and super cute. I’ve had so many complements on these!
5.0,"You would never know by looking at this, but it's a mood stone that responds on both sides, so you can see what color your mood is closest to your skin as well as more outside.  It's really, really gorgeous.  Looks like it's much more expensive that the price on amazon and makes a fantastic gift!  Bracelet is adjustable as it's a cuff.  Don't hesitate, an added plus is IT'S MADE IN THE USA!!!!!"
5.0,It is beautiful. I love it.

5.0,"The colors aren’t as strong as they are in the model pictures, they’re a little more pastel. However, I think that makes them even cuter!! I’ve been a fan of Care Bears since I was a kid and they do the job of giving me a smile ❤️. They’re good quality and nicely detailed!"
5.0,Colors were very pretty and comfortable.
5.0,Bought these for all the grandkids before ski season. Ranging in age from 6-10 they all wore them regularly for skiing - good fit and kept feet warm and dry
5.0,"Arrived very fast, quality as expected. Sizes run on the smaller side"
5.0,Not disappointed at all.
5.0,LOOVVEE ITTT! PERFECT CONDITION! LOOKS GREAT! SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON ITTT! WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE AS A GIFT OR FOR YOURSELF!
5.0,This was absolutely perfect for my son’s Star-Lord costume!
5.0,It is beautiful!  Wanted it for Jeep Beach in Daytona.
5.0,Good quality. Perfect for my 9 year old. She loves it.
5.0,"This pendant is beautiful and looks MUCH more expensive than it is.  I plan to buy another for my best friend.  It is so unusual and while the diamonds are small--they sparkle like crazy!  The chain is very nice too , substantial ,  with a lobster claw clasp.  I am an older woman and this pendant looks very sophisticated --not juvenile--and it looks great combined with a layered small bead necklace.  I love it!!"
5.0,I was surprised at the quality and beauty of this heart necklace.  My wife loves it.
5.0,"Not only does it polish jewelry, but it's also great for buffing out scratches on my watch crystal."
5.0,"Finally, a cleat that fits my wide footed soccer player.  We did add inserts after for comfort and fit.  As other reviews suggest, these are wide and deep, but after removing original insert and adding a sport insert, they fit perfect...no more blisters!  The only complaint my son has is the inner color looks pink, not red.  Technically it is probably coral??  Anyway, the color complaint is not a huge problem for him as long as he's wearing comfortable cleats.  It's pretty cool that they come with different colored shoe laces to choose from too."
5.0,I really like the way these fit and the blue light blocking. I'm very pleased.
5.0,More comfortable and better made than the bridge that came with my glasses. I could not be more pleased.
5.0,"I love this ginger snap petite bracelet, i have small wrists and this fits great (can also fit larger wrist ans there is a chain to hook the hook into). I have gotten many compliments on this already."

5.0,"I am super in love of my new Ring, is beautiful and delighted."
5.0,"My daughter wanted something a little more detailed and different for her bridesmaids. She loves them. I love that they don't look cheap, even though they were very inexpensive."
5.0,"Exactly as I expected, super cute."
5.0,"It was sent as a birthday present. I didn't see it, But the recipient was pleased."
5.0,"I got the light brown Camel color band. So far this watch band works great and feels great with no rubbing on my wrist. I've had it for around 3 months now and it still looks and wears like its brand new. The leather material is very soft and it hooks to the watch securely. I have the bigger 42mm watch and got the smaller 38mm band for it, and it still works great! no problems and looks very stylish!"
5.0,Love these frames!!
5.0,"This is a great value pack of these special socks. The sticky pads on the bottom really stick! So they are great for demonstrating poses on the wood floor. I use them when I'm teaching yoga and walking around the studio a lot.<br />The size runs larger. They fit me great and I wear a size 10, medium width, slender shaped foot."
5.0,Love this pattern! One of my favorite surgical caps!
5.0,Looks sweet!
5.0,Nice pants. Good fit.
5.0,"Great material not see through exactly what was seen on the model great for summer and transition into early fall season I'm 5ft 6"" weight 156 get it in a XL based on the reviews I'm made the right choice."
5.0,This is a gift for my father because I’ve ordered one for myself before and I love it. It is very rugged and stands up to a lot of wear and tear.
5.0,The sleeve length is just right and these hoodies are very soft and comfy.
5.0,Such a cute dress! Fits true to size. I wore it for the first time yesterday and I received several compliments on it. I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0,This band was more than I expected. The leather exterior with the silicon interior was better than I expected! It’s extremely comfortable and well made. Must have for your band collection.
5.0,These are great.  My daughter has been using the tights from this 2 pack over a year now and neither one has a run yet.  Still going strong!
5.0,This is such a pretty purse. It is a little on the large side.
5.0,These overalls are adorable.  The material is a thinner denim but I actually prefer that.  They are cropped and cuffed at the perfect length.  I am thinking about getting them in another color.
5.0,They are a bit longer than most t-shirts.  I typically wear a tall and these fit ok.  I really like them and they look nice.
5.0,LOVE IT!! Got loads of compliments!!
5.0,"I'm not gonna lie, I bought this in blue because of one review pic and it is so cute! My previous wallet was nearly identical to this one but grey and starting to fade. Only it was $30 so I'm so happy I found this one that's more my style and cheaper"
5.0,very beautiful bracelet get lost of beautiful comments
5.0,It is very study. It changes the look of a very bland black purse. I like that it can be for a shoulder bag or crossbody purse.

5.0,So soft and beautiful!
5.0,These shoes are so gorgeous!! It took me tons of shoes to try in that are comfortable for my wedding and let me tell you they are great! The heel is not too high or too low. The sparkle on them is just amazing I cant wait to wear these!!
5.0,Purchased this for my wife because she wanted Alice and Wonderland and she didn’t like the ones at Disneyland. Received this day earlier which was great. It is elastic so read descriptions but I think it’s better because we always tend to tug on them
5.0,Quedan bien pero muy largas
5.0,Had to return to small for my hands
5.0,"Honestly, exactly what I wanted. Very happy with this purchase. Very comfortable. No issues what so ever."
5.0,"Been wearing the same old Twist-O-Flex for over 30 years without a problem. I have it on all the time, working on cars and getting it snagged in things, it has never failed me. The only reason I bought this one is because my old band wasn't quite wide enough for the new watch. It doesn't pinch or pull hairs. As long as Speidel keeps making Twist-O-Flex I will never buy anything else."
5.0,Awesome quality
5.0,loved it - purchase for family and the baby looked adorable.  The workmanship was excellent.  Arrived quickly and was well wrapped.
5.0,"My daughter and I received a lot of compliments on this flannel top. I bought one blue and one red. the size runs small, we use small size tops. We are both 5 ft and between 95-104lb. We git the large size and it fits just right. The arm fitting is a bit tight but enough to be able to move your arms."
5.0,"I ordered a small and it's bit too large for me, but I have a small head.  It definitely keeps my neck warm, which is one feature that drew me to this."
5.0,nice for the 4th of July

5.0,Comfortable house shoes for lounging.
5.0,Great watch. Reliable. Does everything it needs to do. Great price.

5.0,These are so cute and lightweight! I definitely will be buying more.
5.0,"These pants are great. A little thin, but very flattering and extra comfortable."
5.0,Really nice construction. My three year old loved it.
5.0,I work outside in all types of weather. I usually have to wear a couple pairs of socks to keep warm. Not with these. 1 pair keeps me warm all day.
5.0,"We ordered the cap and gown  in the colors for her school and in shiny, it's deffinatly the royal blue expected.. I compared it to the cap and gown my son got through school.. deffinatly same as a schools. She will be walking stage in May and ready to wear!"

5.0,These hats are just what I was looking for and amazing
5.0,Es mas color rojo
5.0,I like the cufflinks. They arw charming.
5.0,This most definitely gives the beauty blender a run for its money! It feels just like it and works great as well. I'm done with the overpriced beauty blender and will stick to this now. So glad I found this!
5.0,Just what I wanted and hasn't lost the glittery bling at all.  Great purchase!
5.0,The size fit as expected.
5.0,"I have this incredible stickler for backpacks. I want them to be able to stand on their own, hold their shape, have comfy straps, and be water resistant all without annihilating my wallet.<br /><br />The Hondo has fit the bill and much more. It doesn't have an overwhelming amount of pockets which gives it a fairly sleek look. You never have to go digging around in recesses because everything is reachable within one zipper pull.<br /><br />Coupled with Chrome's famous warranty policy, this bag is gonna keep being my travel companion and daily carry."
5.0,Color sparkles
5.0,I bought this for my daughters 100th day of school celebration. It worked perfect and looked cute!!

5.0,This was exactly what I wanted! It fit great and I felt good in it!
5.0,"Gorgeous. Bought to attach to crocheted pocketbook I made for my granddaughters so they could tell theirs apart. Classy, expensive looking yet reasonably priced. They love it!"
5.0,"These are much bigger that I had thought they would be.  I am pleased about that.<br /> My only issue is that if I had looked at the picture closer I would have notices that the leaves go the same direction.  So, when wearing them one set of leaves points away from your face and the other one points towards your face.  I think they both should point either towards your face or away from your face.<br />I still love them though."
5.0,"I have quite a few Apple Watch bands and this metal one stands out above the other metal ones we own. The color is nice and bright and really stands out! My favorite part is that it has two magnets, one at the end (as all of them have) but this also has a second where the over flap starts as well so no adjusting through out the day. I'm definitely going to by some other colors!"
5.0,Superrr
5.0,"Looks very classy and well made, it was darker than I was expecting when compared to the pictures."
5.0,The dress fit absolutely PERFECT!!!

5.0,"I have worn this set a lot since it is so pretty, simple, and well-made!"
5.0,"This scarf is my new favorite outfit accessory. I got the one with the baby blue, navy, white, mustard yellow, and brownish maroon. The colors are true to the picture. I am absolutely in love with it. It's super soft, huge, warm, and very pretty. It's large enough it can be used as a blanket but it's a perfect square so when folded into a triangle and wrapped around it makes this amazing scarf. I've gotten so many compliments on it already. This blanket scarf just blows my infinity scarves away. I'm absolutely obsessed with this scarf now and I cannot wait to have one in every pattern and color. The only negative thing about it is that it can get snagged easily. If snagged within the scarf it can be fixed by pulling on the string further away from the snag. It has been easy to fix to far. Other than that, I love this scarf.<br />  I was able to receive this scarf at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review."
5.0,"The top was as I expected. Material is lighter weight, more like tshirt than sweatshirt. I love it. Colors are as displayed."
5.0,Definitely works
5.0,I love this dress! It’s very comfortable and I love the fact that you dress it up or you can go a little more casual with it. The material is very light weight! I am 5’5” 180 and the large fits perfect. I would definitely recommend this dress!

They are so nicely made. they magnet closed and to each other. The hold quite a lot of bills. They even come with sticker labels so you can identify which budget category each envelope is for. We took the Dave Ramsey Financial Peace University class and LOVE the envelope system."
5.0,Very cute and great material
5.0,"This is so beautiful and nice. My daughter loves it, does not wear anything from the time she got this. Quality is really great."
5.0,"It is a great watch, better than what the seller described. it could be a perfect gift for child or an adult. and it came working exactly as the eastern time is, with 2 extra batteries for future replacement, and I think it is worth more than the price it list at, I suggest to order few of it for any coming occasion. Also it might take some time in the mail but it is worth waiting. Do not miss it, get it."
5.0,The hoodie is great beside the length was a little short
5.0,Love the color & great for lounging & sleeping
5.0,"Gorgeous crystals, magnificent presentation. Bought this for myself, but would make a lovely gift!"

5.0,It was very well made and better than expected.
5.0,"I got this hat for my partner-- as he was going on an ice-fishing trip with a friend. The hat is VERY soft, cozy, and warm. It also include a flap that you can secure across your mouth for added warmth. However, you can remove that flap if necessary. The hat worked well for him during the trip-- it is comfortable and keeps you warm."
5.0,"I can’t believe it’s under$6.<br />I bought black and pink and this one. Must have for summer at the beach.<br />I’m 5’6, 140lbs and ordered M. Fits perfect."

5.0,"Wow. ..this is fantastic, I can't wait to start using this belt. .<br />I recommend it for others customer.<br />Thanks to Amazon."
5.0,These socks are wonderful and usually stay up nicely. I am diabetic so am careful about socks. These didn't cut into my legs or cause swelling. Nice product. They are warm but not thick. Would like some softer colors but otherwise really pleased.
5.0,Love this blouse! It is a darling design and fits well. Doesn't show in the photo that the length is quite long and even a bit longer in the back.
5.0,Love them. Just like pictured

5.0,This super duper cute! I picked out the tiger one for my mama cause I knew she would love it which she did! It's really soft and feels like a mini stuffed animal holding its little barrel that holds the glasses. Even the material is soft and scratch proof there wouldn't be any worry about it sratching your glasses. I also love that it's not cheaply made and it doesn't fall over when the glasses are inside. My mom keeps this right on her night stand next to the bed for easy access to her glasses in the morning.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I Recieved this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,"Beautiful pin, nice size, nicely made"
5.0,These arrived ahead of time and I love love love them.
5.0,"The posts are a bit thick, but after a bit of piercing stretch quite comfortable. I'm not a big hoop kinda gal so these are the perfect size. They are about the size of nickels. Very shiny, no tarnish or rubbing off of gold to date."
5.0,My son loves this shirt..
5.0,Great quality. Thicker than anticipated.
5.0,EXCELLENT for tiny faces like mine - nice cleaning cloth and case included!
5.0,"These fit very true to size, are very soft and stretchy. They are higher waisted and work well to hold you in!"
5.0,I wore this everyday for a month leading up to election day! It sparked many conversations about voting and the election.
5.0,Very pretty braclet .I am pleased.
5.0,"I buy one of these every school year for my sons because they love the style but cannot stand the traditional lace model, which is very difficult to put on and take off. The kids have PE at school during the day and sometimes, they need to take off the shoes to either change or play games in a padded room. These velcro Vans are the best and save them a lot of struggle. My biggest child purchased the HP green ones with laces and it takes her forever to put them on."
5.0,Rare white face that i like. Weighty feel w/o feeling too heavy. Clasp is strong enough for everyday use as i wear it for work. Packaged nicely in factory box; quite well protected shipping packaging as well.
5.0,Soft and comfortable to sleep in as well as wear around the house
5.0,"Love this brand! I have bought so many leggings that just aren't right - these are a perfect fit and super comfortable.  My husband loves them, too!"

5.0,"Nice colors, fashion statement and they work"
5.0,"Great quality and super cute. I purchased the leopard print mask by this brand from a brick an mortar store and it was so great I searched Amazon for more. The mask is multi layered (for greater protection), structured but still soft, covers a little more of your face than most masks, and provides more space in the mouth area. Highly recommended."
5.0,~ Beautiful bracelet ~
5.0,WILL TRY IT THIS COMING SUMMER...!!! THANKS!
5.0,Not real silver. False advertisement.
5.0,"It's a very inspiring hat, the response I get from other people is very encouraging,and the statement of the head is reflective to the way I actually feel & think praise Jesus!!!! Sign: satisfied customer."
5.0,Excelentes
5.0,I love this bracelets and are gorgeous
5.0,My niece loved this for her Christmas gift. She wears them a lot.
5.0,Very cute and sparkles galore
5.0,Really nice will order more
5.0,Very good material gift for father will be pleased
5.0,Great quality material and fits my LV clutch handbag and I can wear it like a crossbody purse. I would definitely buy again
5.0,These are not quite as opaque as my other sunguard glasses however they are more stylish and less Optometrist in nature.  I love them!!
5.0,"Recently I was introduced to Hematite by a friend. I have fallen in love with this magnetic material. Since going back to the practice of meditation, I was looking for Hematite jewelry to help with my focus and grounding. This bracelet and pendant set is exactly what I wanted. The round beads are broken up by a small Buddha head. It fits comfortably and is easy to put on and take off. The pendant is two sided and comes with a black necklace. The set comes in a lovely velvet pouch which makes it a perfect gift for anyone practicing relaxation techniques, meditation or is a follower of Asian philosophies. I am very pleased with this purchase, the price and, so far, the quality."
5.0,Beautiful  Dress will post pictures  at a later  date!
5.0,I absolutely love this bag. It’s big enough to hold all my school stuff and everything I need to take to work. It has so many pouches. Literally my favorite bag
5.0,"This is a sturdy key holder. You cannot miss it in your handbag, and it is easy to find if you accidentally put it down other than where it is usually kept.  Simply put I like to give credit where credit is due.  This key holder is a keeper since it is by far more sturdy than the last one I owned. This one that I just purchased is for two keys: the front door and the mailbox. I am happy with this purchase."
5.0,"Good quality soft and thick jersey material. Pleasantly surprised with the quality. I love that this isn’t an empire waist dress and actually hits right at the natural waist just above the belly button- accentuates your feminine shape and hides flaws without looking like an empire waist maternity dress. I bought the teal one. Great casual-to-dressy casual (depending on how you style it and the occasion). Material is stretchy, soft, but on the thicker side which is great because it’s not see through whatsoever, but I wouldn’t wear this dress in extreme heat or a very humid climate. I live in California with relatively dry summers mostly in the 90’s so I think the dress will be comfortable enough for most days if I’m not spending ALL of my time outdoors. You could wear this spring and fall as well and probably be comfortable. Dress goes all the way to the tops of my feet at 5’6” size large. (I have a muscular athletic body with a flat tummy)"
5.0,These are beautiful
5.0,Works like a champ
5.0,"I love it, it fits nice and is very soft and comfy"

5.0,So Freakin Comfortable!
5.0,I followed everyone’s advice and the shirt fit great.  It’s a good product.
5.0,great tie
5.0,I purchased both these & the original salt waters at the same time. They are exactly the same shoe. Everything about them except the fact that these are almost half the cost & have velcro which makes it possible for my toddler to put them on herself. They also might be a tiny bit wider because I didn’t have to get them wet to mold them.  I got them in brown thinking my daughter would probably never wear them except when I make her when we’re going somewhere nicer & don’t want the different rainbow/flower/jelly sandals she already loves. These are so comfortable that she picks them out & wears them every day - most days they get soaked. They still look great & have held up beautifully.
5.0,It was delivered early.It is gorgeous.The stone is bigger then I expected.I love it.It looks authentic.I love it! My husband was surprised too.
5.0,I put these on my shoes so I don’t have to tie and untie them since I work in a garden nursery atmosphere and have to remove my shoes each time that I enter my home. They have made my life much more simple!

5.0,Well made. Fit and finish very good. Keeps accurate time. Very good value.

5.0,"I got these socks as a xmas gift and they came two pair to a pack, which I like. I tried them on (medium) and they fit perfect. They are warm and have a really good grip. This is a great gift to give to a yoga person."

5.0,I love a good fanny pack!!! Even though it appears compact I’m able to store everything I need and still have room to hold others belongings.
5.0,I have a smaller bust and a wider waist so I had to do some tailoring to accommodate my proper sizing. The size I ordered was based off my waist and fit perfect through there. The dress is fluffy without a petticoat but is so much fuller with one.
5.0,These are beautiful they don't change .
5.0,Nice size and seem sturdy!!
5.0,Got this for my 12 yr old granddaughters birthday. She loved it. Very nice looking and very good quality!
5.0,Very comfortable and love the style.  I was skeptic about the price thinking it was going to be a very cheap product in regards to it's quality. I receive compliments every time I use them.
5.0,"This the least expensive of the 3500 Series Casio PRO TREK Watches, but the same 5 key feature I needed:<br /><br />1) Solar-Powered<br />2) Atomic Clock Synchronization<br />3) Compass<br />4) Altimeter<br />5) Barometer<br /><br />These aforementioned features met my exact requirements and the watch appears to be more than durable enough for the elements. Also, the screen is actually very crystal clear and much better than the photo provided by Amazon for this model.<br /><br />Perhaps the only enhancement I would ask for is a slightly larger screen size than the U.S. quarter-sized circular screen.<br /><br />I highly recommend this specific model due to its price and features."
5.0,My son loves them. He says they are very comfortable
5.0,Love love love these😍
5.0,love it!!!good quality
5.0,My son used this on a 75 mile white water raft trip.  It was easy for him to use and everything came home dry.
5.0,LOVE the material!! I am a Large but the reviews said to order a size smaller so I did but that was not a good idea lol. I love them so much I just went ahead and ordered a Large.  The mediums will fit me eventually!
5.0,Very durable and good quality
5.0,This dress was beautiful! It fits well and is so comfortable. I returned it because I ended up going with a different dress but had that dress not been awesome this dress would have been my choice.
5.0,"I  ordered these in two colors and  wear them each day. I  have a pair at each door and kick off my  outside shoes as soon as I  get in the door. These are very comfortable and have just enough grip on the bottom that I don't slip and slide on my wood floors. They are holding up well,"
5.0,"My daughter who is 19 this month loves this hoodie. Fits her well. Can't say anything about the quality yet until she wares and washes it a few times. It was expensive for the material, however you are not paying for material but for Big Bang Theory merchandise."
5.0,I bought this hat for my son who was blessed with what i call a Charlie Brown head. He is 13 yrs old and large in every way for his size.  The hat fits perfectly.  to give u an idea..I also have a big head and wear wigs and this hat fits perfect over the wigs or braids.
5.0,"Super cute, fits perfectly and the material is very soft! Could not ask for more!"
5.0,"These are some of the best sunglasses I have ever purchased! The packaging is great and the shipping was fast. They are very flattering and feel good on your face, they are not uncomfortable at all. I really enjoy these as a statement piece and for protection as well.  A terrific buy!"
5.0,Fast service excellant product
5.0,"This is very solid and substantial.  If you like the looks of it, you can't go wrong because it's so inexpensive.  I would warn that the sizing is small.  The size 8 fits on my ring finger whereas all my other ring finger rings are size 7."
5.0,"The shaft is too short, I can't use them.<br />EDIT: I reviewed too soon, I was still swollen. They fit perfectly!!!"
5.0,Cute dress. I put a white belt on with it which spruced it up. Runs true to size.
5.0,This product is simply amazing. Every time I see them dangling from my mirror I’m reminded of the wonderful trilogy that made my childhood. 10/10 would recommend
5.0,Just got this baby in the mail. So far I love it! It does have padding in it but it has a slit on the side that allows you to move the padding around as needed. It fits true to size and is very comfortable.

5.0,"You can't go wrong with this dress up fairy dress.  Multi colored tulle hangs from a 'velvet' bodice complete with silky ribbons.  Item looks exactly as pictured.  Very cute and fun for our 3 year old granddaughter to dress up in.  The tulle flares out nicely when twirling!  At $13, it's a steal - hours of playtime."
5.0,A very stylish piece that would compliment your collection.

5.0,This ear cuff is adorable. It makes me feel a little funky which is what I like!

5.0,I liked the material used.
5.0,"Received the gloves as expected. However, I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the gloves and the way the gloves were packaged – in a protective sleeve and boxed up! Would I purchase another pair, YES!"
5.0,very cute! not great for NE winters but perfect for late summer/fall.
5.0,My lil one is between 3-4 depending on how its made we can land anywhere. I ordered a 4 so glad I did they will last all summer unless we get hit with another spurt. Will purchase for next summer.
5.0,"This dress is absolutely beautiful. I bought it to wear to a Summer wedding. Light, airy and elegant. I just had toadd a snap to the bust area as it was a little too revealing but other than that it’s perfect! I am 5’4 and about 150 lbs and the Large allowed a little room for flow and movement. So glad I purchased!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:1062e2c2dba4c912e76d3242488c4bd2]] ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️It doesn’t have the fur!!! Don’t buy this❗️<br />❌❌❌

5.0,Ordered med. fit perfect
5.0,Good quality for this low price
5.0,So far my boyfriend loves this and it seems to be working! Thank you

5.0,they keep feet toasty warm
5.0,"I was looking for an inexpensive poncho that would allow me to run in the rain, or at least wait in the rain for a while, providing coverage but not be too warm.  These were perfect.  Plus, they are so light weight that I was able to fold it up and carry with me to reuse rather than just toss away.  They were perfect for my needs."
5.0,Tamano bien
5.0,Just what I needed for my costume. I didn’t want the blue shield helmet and this was worth the extra money
5.0,Very effective in the cold.
5.0,"Love these yoga capris, fits perfect and the fabric is nice and thick"
5.0,Love this ring. Bought it for myself and was very happy when I put it on and it shines and I have been complimented when wearing it.
5.0,Really like these jammies.  The pants are to long for me from crotch to waist band. Have to roll it down. If you are long waslistwd they would be perfect.
5.0,Great! Daughter won’t go in the water without them. Snap on strap helps eliminate strap from getting tangled in hair when putting on/taking off.
5.0,"This is a very delicate & dainty bracelet that looks very feminine. It also adds a touch of sophistication to dressy attire. There's a 1.5&#34; inch extender to fit wrist sizes up to 7 inches. For the price this bracelet doesn't look cheap & the quality is okay if you handle it gently. Bracelet arrived in 14 business days. Overall I think this is a good addition to my jewelry collection, therefore it's a keeper !!"
5.0,My son loves these. They lasted well. They started to stink so we’ve been spraying with Lysol and it solved the problem.
5.0,"At first I was reluctant at trying this, but I was well worth it. After following instructions for a custom T-shirt and manual adjustment when using my phone. It took some time to receive my T-shirt but we'll worth the wait. It would be nice to have choice's of fabric and color. But no complaints here. Try it u might like it."
5.0,"I can't tell how durable it is until I use it for a while but it looks stylish, cheerful, sturdy and roomy, and I plan to use it when I go shopping. We have to pay for bags now in New York. This bag will come in handy."
5.0,I bought this beanie for my son  and  he loves it. He said it fits better than any other one he has ever had. He also said it was the most comfortable beanie he has ever had on his head.
5.0,"Great glasses, very well made. Unfortunately, I had to return them because they were too small. I reordered a new pair, same brand, and they are too big. I dont think I'll order glasses online again. It's very difficult to imagine how they will look on your face."
5.0,"Beautiful, soft, colors are gorgeous.  Perfect in every way"
5.0,My wife  loves it
5.0,Good quality and fit very nicely

5.0,Looks very nice and was a good fit!
5.0,I've got a giant melon.... these fit!
5.0,It is a beautiful necklace.  Great to use any ocassion.
5.0,This looks great. I like that the chain is thick enough that I don't feel like it will break. The clasp/chain has room to go a little longer or shorter. The feathers are pretty. There's an option for 3 feathers but I chose 2 after reading reviews they made a little noise clanking together. Mine do clank a little but it's totally fine.
5.0,"So cute,  exactly as I expected"
5.0,"I'm actually shocked at the quality for the price.  It came in a gift box with a gift bag, small birthday card, and a silver polishing cloth.  Definitely a great value!"
5.0,Love it - so comfortable!
5.0,"I received these corciova polarized sunglasses at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  I will receive no other compensation for my review.<br /><br />I received the champagne colored frames, they are champagne on the temples and outer sides of the frame and fade to a coffee colored brown on the inner and bridge parts of the frame, which I think adds to the look of them.  They are over-sized frames so I was not shocked at the size of them, which covers roughly 1/3-1/2 of my face, which I'm okay with.<br /><br />The lens are polarized and I saw in a review that someone mentioned they see rainbows and spots, I did not have this problem at all.  The lens are perfectly clear and helps with cutting glare.  I was able to use my tablet (which reflects every bit of light it can possibly find) without a single problem.  I am able to wear them in the car and even in the southern sunlight I didn't have to squint due to the sun, like I do in my regular glasses.<br /><br />The only down side, and this is no fault of their own, is because I'm Asian, I have high, rounded cheeks so it does leave the frame indent on my cheeks, but if I slide them just a tab bit away from my face, I can wear them comfortably and not get the indent.<br /><br />I will be looking at getting at least one more pair from them as they do everything they claim and look amazing!!"
5.0,Love the watches
5.0,"I was surprised how comfortable these sandals are and how well they fit. These do not have a soft sole unlike my alternate sandals which have a soft base like memory foam, I expected to dislike them because of this but I was wrong and these are now my ""go to""."
5.0,"Looks great, fits great, comfortable cotton material which I prefer over the rayon type ones.  Colorful, perfect for Bowling Shirt Fridays.  (Every Friday.)"
5.0,Pretty good so far will update
5.0,"This is absolutely made for me! It is comfortable, the fabric is fine, and it displays books. What more could I ask for!"
5.0,"I love this product! The bathing suit is so cute! And it is high quality! Also it is very comfortable, but if you normally wear a medium I would buy a large. The product runs a little bit small, but other than that PERFECT! I am 5&#34;5 about 135 lbs. I usually wear a medium, so I got a large."
5.0,Great colors and really love the design of this dress. fits perfectly Great church dresses to wear to church and events

5.0,I love the movie and if I have to wear a mask these ones will be it. Completely breathable and stays put!
5.0,I love this top it's beautiful on me
5.0,"I guess I am too short for this to be a crop pant, but it looks great anyway."
5.0,"These horns are amazing, I got so many complements and they are actually quite comfortable. I would highly recommend these. I had no problems with slippage or anything (plus they came with attachable &#34;teeth&#34; you could put on the headband if needed, but I didn't need them). The size is perfect, not too big as to be annoying with long wear, but not too small either. They look exactly as pictured."
5.0,"Great pair of comfy jean shorts. Not to long, not to short."
5.0,My daughter's engagement party!
5.0,Beautiful purple earrings. They will look gorgeous on my daughter.
5.0,Like the fit although it does not push the girls in from the side as much as I'd hoped that it would.
5.0,"For the price, these jeans are of really good quality. It fits really well and is very comfortable to wear since it is quite stretchy. It fits true to size for me and I like that even though it is a skinny fit, it isn't super tight."
5.0,"These bands look great and the wifey says they fit perfect since the size is completely customizable. What's nice is they stretch so if your wrist swells a bit during the day it isn't going to feel like it is cutting off your circulation. The only suggestion would be to offer a red and black one (not red, black and green like you currently do)."
5.0,Perfect 👍🏼
5.0,Beautiful  dress have gotten  lots of compliments on it. Washes great also

5.0,I bought it as 40th anniversary gift for my wife. She hasn't seen it yet. It looks good to me.
5.0,"I had this custom made for one of my closest friends for a group name he came up with, he really liked it! The only thing we would both change is more options of larger text and different fonts!"
5.0,The shoes fit great. The width of the shoes is somewhat narrow but I have really small feet so fits m perfectly. I would love to get another pair in different colour.
5.0,One of the most comfortable prices of clothing I own. I'd buy it again.
5.0,"I really love these . Very soft, nice."
5.0,Great look. Feels good. Easy to secure

5.0,Birthday present
5.0,Perfect size and color
5.0,I love the wallet it holds everything  ID credit cards Passport I like it a lot.!!

5.0,Perfect for college game days!
5.0,My son had to have them to play soccer and he loves them. This is the first pair that he's had that he will actually wear.
5.0,"I'm very impressed on these pants they fit like a glove. It's so hard for me to find pants with 34in length and these are perfect, I would buy more from this seller but it looks like they only come in black."
5.0,"I love these, bought these for my 3 month old. The only problem is they slide down her forehead, I'm sure it's just because her size, either way I love them"

5.0,This watch band is so beautiful and comfortable. It is made well and the variety of beads is gorgeous.
5.0,"I was a little unsure if I wanted to order shoes online, I have big calves and its always my problem, but I thought well their combat boots I think I will b fine...so I went ahead n order them... they got here promptly and they looks amazing when i took them out of the box... Just wore my boots for the 1st time yesterday (sat) for an outside festival... they looked great, supper comfy to walk around with (my friends n I parked blocks away n boots felt great)... Now I'm hoping the heal won't break... it looks pretty sturdy, but the way boot hills are made now a days... they always mushroom out on me...  Hope not!"
5.0,Exactly looks like on the photo. Well made and beautiful.
5.0,These are perfect for the job I have
5.0,"dainty and pretty, love it."
5.0,❤❤❤❤❤❤ this seller! Great customer service! Great unique products! I've bought four (4) purses from them and they all turn heads; but this one takes the cake! Will def be back-- AGAIN! LOL 😘
5.0,Cutest socks ever! Everyone wanted to know where I got them. No more sweaty feet on Mini Melissa!
5.0,It’s a little thicker than I would like but the look is great.
5.0,My 2 year old grandson loves his boots! and easy on and off for him!!
5.0,Nice case for keeping my safety glasses in good shape. Hard case keeps them from getting crushed.
5.0,"I really love these sunglasses. Good fit, great find."
5.0,"Great fit, dress up, down or sporty. 💛🖤🏈 GEAUX SAINTS"
5.0,Awesome dupe necklace. Looks expensive & classic!
5.0,Received them on time  and  came in a little pouch they look great
5.0,"I have a woman’s figure and oh, boy does this dress compliment my form.  My date when I walked in was blown away.  The dress is stretchy and doesn’t wrinkle. I live in Hawaii and it’s slippers, tee shirts and shorts.  Nice to have a flattering dress."
5.0,"Really cute dress, not the most flattering somehow. I think the waist is a little weird on me but I kept it. The fabric is a little shiny, not a cotton type material but the good part about that is that it doesn’t wrinkle easily at all. Happy to have it. Fits a little larger than most vintage dresses I’ve ordered in large. It does not shrink a bit after washing either."
5.0,"Great product, great price, delivered quickly."
5.0,really cute and really comfy
5.0,Needed something for my daughter’s graduation and dress was just like picture. Great quality! Fit perfectly and came fast!
5.0,I like the fact that I have gotten so many compliments and many free cups of coffee ☕
5.0,"I ordered 2 different &#34;baby tuxes&#34; in 9 month before this one - they were both close to $50 and when they arrived were strange sizes... pants big enough for a 2 year old and shirt colors so tight I couldn't even button around my chubby buddy's neck<br />This one not so!  I ordered 6-12 month for my 60th percentile 8 month old, and it fit adorably! maybe a LITTLE on the big side<br />(accept the white shirt which was a perfect fit - no way would fit him if he was any chubbier)<br />but the cotton was my favorite part - he was comfortable in it ALL day and people were melting at how adorable he was.<br /><br />The bow tie is sewn on - which for me was excellent as he immediately was trying to eat it.<br />If you want to use your own bow tie, the stitching is readily available inside the shirt and could be snipped off.<br />possible cons, quality of the stitching on the hem of pants was not great, so will probably not last many washings,<br />but I don't plan on dressing my babe in a tux often, so not a big deal for me."
5.0,Having just lost a bunch of weight I needed a new swim suit. This one fits perfectly looks beautiful and hides the places that still need some toning.
5.0,5'3&#34; 125lb fits great......

5.0,"Love the necklace, received quickly, l am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Best lsat I’ve seen and used. I’ve had a couple.
5.0,"A little pricey, but they were sold out everywhere so I was happy to find one available."
5.0,I was surprised that the back was just a bit longer than the front. Besides a bit too big it fit as expected.
5.0,"the carabiner  is perfectly designed and heavy duty, should last a long time - i like that the part that holds the ring also opens to just slip on the key ring - BUT the rings it come with are awful, they have a slim rectangular design that wont fit some keys and have fairly sharp edges, i just threw them away and got some with round cross section and i have a key system that may last a lifetime"
5.0,The XL watchband was the length that I needed.
5.0,Excellent quality and fit as expected but not straight leg.  More like boot cut.
5.0,"I was so impressed, wasn't expecting that high a quality for the price paid! It's beautiful and will be a classic staple in my wardrobe."
5.0,Nice tie. Seems to be good quality
5.0,"I got this back a couple days ago.  I bought it used, and even used, I'm surprisingly impressed with the electrical components, they seem sturdy, and sound much better than I imagined.  Not saying they are audiophile ready, but for a backpack, they sound very nice.  At 10 watts each, these speakers seem to pack quite a punch.  I didn't want to max them and risk blowing them, but got some good noise out of the bag.  Today I walked around downtown Seattle in the middle of the day with traffic all around, at about 60% the output my phone can do, and I could still enjoy my music with my friend.<br /><br />I don't like all the attention it creates, but it's worth the awesome Indie-Movie-Soundtrack-to-Your-Life effect you get from the bag.<br /><br />Share excellent sounds with the world! Have fun!"
5.0,Such quality and such a great reminder to see everyday! Thank you! And thank you God!
5.0,Descent quality at a good price. Will be using them for the jewelry I make
5.0,I really like the socks.
5.0,"I received this box for Christmas and it is very nice.  Hinges are well made and the lid is well placed to accomodate ""thick"" watches such as my Seiko Contoura.  It holds 10 watches nicely on the soft ""pillows"".  The key is useless because if someone wanted to ""steal"", obviously they could just take the entire box. Overall, I give it a 5 Star."
5.0,Pretty and lightweight
5.0,Love the mask very comfortable for your face
5.0,They are the nicest looking glasses! Better looking than my Gucci
5.0,"Satisfied with my purchase, true to size no need to order a larger size, love the pockets  on them great for the gym!!"
5.0,"quality is as expected,o.k. shirt is very cool if you are a old zappa fan.phi zappa crappa!"
5.0,I ordered this ring for my 18 year old son. He absolutely loves it and wears it all the time. The look is simple and classic. Highly recommend.
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress! At 5'2.5 "", I weigh &lt;100lbs, and my favorite winter attire is wearing turtlenecks under longer tops like dresses or sweaters over leggings and of course boots, in this instance, swapped for tennis shoes to play darts. I've tightened the bodice, so this will continue to fit even when  I regain 10-15lb. The dress is constructed very well, the stitching isn't something I need to worry about and the materials used are a good quality. Two fabrics were used, the top a polyester type material with easy to use zipper in the back makes it easy on/off, while the plaid bottom is made from a soft brushed flannel material just as I'd hoped. As you can see, the tapers go below knee length, I hadn't realized the sides were as short until I saw the pics a couple days later, but it's still a great length in my opinion, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase, intending to buy more.<br />Only 'con' and I do NOT fault the seller! I had 2 orders from 2 sellers the same day, and as I've had several previous orders from China, I'm aware only an estimated time frame of  dates pkgs will arrive can be given as there's no way to know how long it will take USPS, UPS, FedEx that follows upon arrival in the States, but It's always a nice surprise when they come before expected, others arrive at the other end of the spectrum, but I have been able to track all, until this one! I don't know why, but I couldn't get any tracking info  after it left/was mailed from China, something to do with China, it appears, so I was surprised to find it'd been delivered. I liked it so much, I wanted to write a review, but couldn't as Amazon showed it as 'expect delivery....', which it continued to do until yesterday, well over a week after it had been delivered. I've no idea what, if anything can be done about tracking, but wanted to alert others this happened."
5.0,Fix really good. It’s adjustable. Nice color of black too.
5.0,I ordered this for me niece and it is so cute! I ordered the wine color and it’s very pretty for fall/winter. It’s not overly heavy so she could layer this or wear it alone. The ruffle details in the collar and ties on the sleeves make this very stylish. It has a ribbed texture and the material is nice and appears to be of good quality. It is machine wash and able to be placed in the dryer.
5.0,Product is perfect size for a square table with 8 chairs. So far quality seems great. Lights are nice but dim- more for ambience than illumination but that’s ok for my purposes. I would recommend!
5.0,Just love it! 100 % 👍🏻
5.0,This top is adorable. Fits great and the material is great.
5.0,These are really cute and aren't too big or heavy on the ears.
5.0,unbelievable value
5.0,"Not sure what else to say...it was well worth the asking price and I got free shipping to boot.  If I need a sterling silver chain, I go to Amazon.com."
5.0,"Daughter loved this dress, we ordered 1 size bigger to make sure amd ended up having to take it in. I would say it fits true to size!"
5.0,"Sox fit fine, temple on my safety glasses are wider than normal glasses but works good and comfortable with no hard plastic rubbing on my head"
5.0,The bracelet is a gift for someone else. I really like it.

5.0,"Love this set, perfect for the wedding."
5.0,Made many keychains with these and they all came out cute
5.0,Got this for my ten year old grandson and he wears it to school daily.  Simple to use and easy to learn.  This has been a great find for me to give to him.
5.0,Comfortable light weight jacket that can be used underneath a heavier jacket.
5.0,I gave this as a gift to a 13 year old girl.  She said she had alot of compliments and loves it.  It was exactly as described.
5.0,Gift for my nephew. He loved it!
5.0,Nice! Good quality
5.0,I liked the comfort and material.
5.0,Very cute and well made.  I have two of these jumpers in different colors and I love them.
5.0,Fits well. Washes well
5.0,Great looking cap
5.0,Nifty little tools! Buy extras because you will lose them..
5.0,"Very nice fit, flattering. bought both colors."
5.0,Good looking ear rings. Love them.
5.0,"If you like bling, this is a great mask!  Not too over the top, just perfect. The tiny stars make it unique over any other mask I've ever seen. The fit is just a little large for my stupid tiny face, so I just put a knot in the fabric behind my ears and it's a perfect fit! Love these masks and have always gotten quick delivery."
5.0,"Sorry for my weird hand position, but it’s a beautiful ring for the price! I ordered a 5, and it’s a little too big, so I just ordered a 4 and will be returning the 5. Love it and can’t wait to wear it when it fits!"
5.0,"I really like this necklace but I was hoping it was a little larger....but still very nice, just found some earrings for it."
5.0,"I love it and am happy it is lighter weight than described. It is not a sweatshirt type material at all. It is thin and lightweight, so easily worn on warmer days."
5.0,"These are great and such an awesome price. I got a little weary of all the crazy prints and bad quality masks that don't come out of the washer well. These fit me just fine, I'm a 5'10 female and my husband is 6'2, both of us normal weights and face sizes, no issues with the size at all! Comfortable against the skin and really good quality. And they don't hurt my ears!"
5.0,"This beautiful scarf was quality material, beautifully painted, and neatly sewn with nice even edges. It is definately worth the money. I was very pleased with how beautiful it was. I would definately buy this again, or any other product made by the same people."
5.0,Loved it was perfect for my wedding
5.0,"I sent this as a present to Terri Lynn Doss and she likes it a lot.  If your girl is into girly things, then get this for her. If your a girl who is into girly things, get it."
5.0,Super comfortable and fits well! I use them for longer indoor rides. Worn and washed a few times (I always hang dry them) and still holding up and performing well! Will be ordering more.
5.0,This is a very nice bangle.  I purchased for my mom that doesn't like jewelry too snug.  This fit perfect!  Doesn't slide off & the color was beautiful.
5.0,"These are very nice for the price. Ear loops are soft & don't hurt! The breathing valve doesn't really do as much as I hoped, but there is a slight 'better' feeling in this than masks without the valve. Fits good/snug in the chin area and nose piece does help keep glasses from fogging."
5.0,Nice quality and a perfect fit.  My girls were very happy.
5.0,"Absolutely love these, great fit!  They even hide the unflattering parts of your body!"
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful classic Mens Watch. Slim case, perfectly fits a 20mm NATO watch band, which is sold separately.  Be aware watch does not come with pins or band, but miles and miles of timeless style. The silver version has a blued second hand, which gleams cobalt in well lit settings. No numbers grace the dial, save the magnified date, instead there are gleaming metal markers for the hours and black minute ticks.<br /><br />Unlike many other watches, which carry distractingly large logos, this benefits from the restrained taste of the designer, who has left his mark “ THOMAS ALEXANDRE” over his location “PARIS” in microfine text across the upper part of the dial. So few watches at this price point offer the refined detail embodied here. Great hopes this will wear and last long, buying a second as backup, immediately. Always stock up when you find something this well made! Five Stars"
5.0,My prissy little cheerleader loves her bracelet!
5.0,Great and on time
5.0,"I don't usually repeat purchase products often, but I LOVE these pants. They are so comfortable and they hit me just right. They don't ride up or down, for me they are high waisted and the pockets are perfect. I would recommend these all day long!<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'6'' and 125 pounds and I got a medium."
5.0,Product as described. My girlfriend loves them.
5.0,They’re great but order 2 sizes larger.
5.0,"Fit as expected. Graphics are clear cut, colors are sharp and bright. Tagless (which my husband always prefers!) Comfortable to wear. Machine washed and air dried with no problem (no shrinkage, no peeling or distortion or fading on the graphics). Made a Rangers fan happy!"
5.0,"I love this outfit, and got many compliments.  I did order a xsmall and although it did fit good, it was a little loose around tummy area. I still love it! It’s hard finding xsmall items in general."
5.0,"I ordered a small, not sure if it's supposed to be a looser dress up top, looser than I expected. BUT it is super comfy, fabric really soft, I love it! I want more of these"
5.0,Great pair of comfortable replacement bands. Definently get these right away the band that comes with the gear fit 2 is awful. This is a huge improvement
5.0,"High quality product, low price!"
5.0,Sorry for the delay.  My grandson (10 years old) just used them Sunday on a deep sea fishing trip.  I didn't want him to loose his eye glasses.  They worked!!!!! Two adults on the boat lost their glasses but he came home with his:)  Would buy again.  Great service.  Very happy with purchase.
5.0,This hat is so cute and fits well. I love it!
5.0,"The skirt was comfortable and cute. It was a little longer than I intially expected, but I still love it!"
5.0,Look nice and protects eyes
5.0,"I measured myself incorrectly the first time. Definitely use the thinnest part of your waist, no matter where your jeans typically sit. The first skirt I ordered just fell off. Using the second set of measurements, it fits perfectly. So elegant, and surprisingly comfortable; I received many compliments when I wore it on Christmas Sunday. It looks delicate, but was sturdy enough for Nursery duty."
5.0,A gift for my daughter who likes them a lot!
5.0,I goofed and got the wrong size the first time I ordered this dress. I reordered the correct size and I love it!!! The fit is perfect! I'm tall and I wanted a maxi that hit the ground and this one does. Its exactly what I was looking for!
5.0,So pretty and nicely made! No strong smell like other reviewers have reported. Perfect sized for a mom on the go.
5.0,Very cute :)
5.0,"This is by far the best casual dress I've ever bought. I have Fibromyalgia and Rheumatoid Arthritis and have a very hard time finding clothes that I can wear out that look good on, but don't hurt my body. This one is perfect!!! Plus you can dress it up a bit if you want too. I've received many complements on it and they all wanted to know where I bought it. Next I'm going to buy the one with the pockets in the front it was very cute too. Same dress with a whole different look"
5.0,"The craftsman ship is great looks exactly like the picture, didn't get smashed on shipping but could have been in a small box to make sure, thee fit was perfect L/LX ,for those wanting this style pa attention to the kind this kind buttons in the front if you see theoie shasoe materials, the other kinds are shaped tighter and the front is sewn as one piece more like a English riding hat type.but this hat was what I wanted as I knew the difference ,I would order again for the quality an price"
5.0,These are comfortable!
5.0,Highly satisfied with this product!! It's very warm and the one I got for my boyfriends mom she loved it too!
5.0,Softest material I've ever felt! Much like the burts bees brand and kickee pants fabric. Got the blanket to match. Haven't been able to fit baby yet as it's for the hospital and baby is still not due to arrive yet.
5.0,I like that it's easy to apply to the wall.
5.0,"so comfortable, loose fitting."
5.0,"Love this nose ring. I have always liked the bigger nose rings and this is perfect. The L shaped part is great too, it is not as long as most other L shaped rings and doesn’t tickle my nose as much. Absolutely love it."
5.0,So soft and comfy and the lace is very cute
5.0,"Love these cute gudatama socks I bought them to replace the ones I got earlier this year. I wore them to death, and these ones in particular because they are a MOOD. You can kinda tell the difference in them. The one that's more faded is from earlier this year. The one on the left is brand new and adorable."
5.0,Perfect! I needed a costume I could wear with my scrubs (pediatric nurse). This and a fur vest will do the trick! The headband fit an adult head nicely.
5.0,Its super cute and it looks a lot better in person. The little J i got will flip all kinds of ways but its really cute and its very small so it looks good!
5.0,This skirt fits so well. It’s a wrap skirt and you put one end thru a hole and tie it on the side. I feel it is very flattering to every body type. I’m 4”7 inches and have 2.5 inch heels on so it is longer on me. I wish they had more of these skirts I love it so much.<br /><br />Top is also from amazon
5.0,"Very nice and very light weight, great in hot climate."
5.0,I love it looks just like picture just material a little thicker.i wear a 2x in all my clothes but a xl fits right on the head XL 16-18
5.0,"At first, I was not sure of them, but after wearing them at work, everyone just loved them! They are so cute and you would never know this, but they keep up all day long and I work in a warehouse."
5.0,Very very beautiful 🤩
5.0,"These are so cute and are perfect for Halloween! They are around the size of a quarter and dangle down from the earring hooks. They feel high quality and look well made, but I don't yet know if they will tarnish. They are a great value."
5.0,This is a must buy! He looked so cute. Fit perfectly.
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Very believable
5.0,"These do fit somewhat large, I purchased 3x intentionally.  I love big sweatshirts with enough room to wear another long sleeve thermal underneath.  Great colors and wash well!  No shrinkage!  Thank you!"
5.0,"Needed a pair of blue blocking glasses for night driving and stumbled across these cute cat frames.  I have a big face, so I was bit worried - turns out these fit great, and they work great too. Less eye fatigue when I am watching tv and much easier to fall asleep at night.<br /><br />Love!"
5.0,Thicker than I intended but they are very sturdy
5.0,"Very nice! This scarf is cute and soft, in addition to being very inexpensive. It doesn't have the shininess that many cheap pashminas have, which I appreciate. I'll definitely buy it in a few more colors."
5.0,I should’ve ordered a size larger. But that’s my bad I’ve put on some weight
5.0,It was big for our toddler but was easy to roll at the waist and tie on. I washed easily without wrinkles. Made for great photo op with grandma.
5.0,Got it for my nephew for his daily wear. They’re very light and stylish in my opinion. Lots of cushion inside.
5.0,Cute and comfortable! I love the ease of wearing nursing dresses!
5.0,Perfect fit. Good quality! Father in law loved it!
5.0,Cost a bit more but I have used these for months with boiling water and it has stood up well during an exceptionally cold inter.
5.0,She is very happy
5.0,good shirts
5.0,Cute hat - skin cancer and need to wear hats now!
5.0,I love See Kai Run shoes for my daughter. This is her fourth pair. I love the fun colors and prints - unique but also makes the shoes seem to match a good variety of outfits. These were her first sandals but loved them just as much as sneakers. They really last until she outgrows them.
5.0,Absolutely love these! Will purchase again. Gave as a gift.
5.0,"Was too small but didn't know if I could return, so we kept them."
5.0,"Shirt is super soft, and adorable. Most have for Morgan Wallen fans. It's a cute shirt and receive many compliments."
5.0,Quality fabric and great price. I will buy it in other colors. I am very pleased with this purchase. I bought it in small and it fits me as expected.
5.0,"very good shirt, good price"
5.0,These gloves are beautiful.  I cannot believe how reasonably priced they are.  I am thrilled with this purchase and anxious to give them as gifts.  I could not have a higher recommendation.  The buckle really classes them up!  Buy these!!
5.0,"&#34;Fit like a Glove&#34;  lol  They are great , nice compression, makes your hand feel like it's ready to work.  Soft feel yet firm grip of the hand.  Nice color too and not too pricey like some other brands."
5.0,Loved it I wear it all the time i just wish I got a smaller size
5.0,Perfect for when we take our week at our timeshare for the odds and ends for the kitchen and laundry cleaning products.
5.0,I love this bag. It fits a laptop and My work files. I like the fact that it’s water resistant and I can carry it outside and not worry about my electroniccs getting damp.
5.0,"Nice, lightweight fabric, hangs nicely, planning to take to Hawaii!"
5.0,"Used just a few times and so don't know how durable they will be, but fit is excellent and the tabs make them easy to take off too."
5.0,Elegant...
5.0,This house coat fit perfectly and looks very nice. I don’t normally like the looks of house coats but this one is different. This is the second one I have purchased from this company. They are flannel so very comfortable and have snap closure so easy to get on and off.
5.0,"If you are familiar with the legging craze (and craze it is.  However, it is also a flashback to the days when leggings and long shirts with belts were in, not that I am old enough to remember those days, let alone have been in JR. High or anything) and leggings are awesome for those of us that have good legs and not much else...you can cover the bad with a tunic and show off the good with leggings...I digress...<br /><br />The leggings are IN right now, for adult women and for the teenagers too.  These leggings are for the younger set.  I am the mother of 5 so I feel very qualified to offer my opinion here.<br /><br />1. don't buy expensive clothes for kids that are still growing and/ or play outside and play rough.<br />2. DO buy clothes that will hide stains.<br />3. DO buy comfy clothes<br />4. DO buy clothes that won't need to be ironed<br />5. Do buy clothes that your daughter can accidentally put on backwards and no one will notice.<br /><br />These leggings fit all of the above criteria.  They are inexpensive.  They are obviously dark (they are camo, they can hide anything) they really don't have a front or back, they are comfy as can be and have an elastic waist.  THey are forgiving and will grow with your kid to an extent.  THey wash well and dry well and don't need an iron.  They are the same fabric as the more expensive brand that is 'buttery soft' and they are cheap enough that you don't feel bad when your daughter grows out of them or puts a hole in the knee. Whichever comes first."
5.0,Feels like Jersey let super comfortable and I usually wear shorts to bed
5.0,I got the rose gold 10pc. For $16 that is a FANTASTIC deal. I usually spend that much on just 1. I was expecting these to be iffy quality but holy crap I can't begin to express how amazing these look in person. The gem is so clear and sparkly. I'm used to the gems looking very fake but these look like real diamond (to an untrained eye ofc). From a distance there's no way you would be able to tell. These are just so bright and so pretty I'm considering ordering a second set. I also haven't had any problems with the top unscrewing like I do all of my other belly rings. These are seriously fantastic and you will not regret buying them!
5.0,Part of our yearly Christmas tradition is that the grandkids dress up in the look alike pjs. These Grinch pjs were great! The kids loved them! The fit well and the two different companies  we got them from were timely! Of course we ordered by the first of Nov. considering the holiday!
5.0,Very sexy outfit for beach.
5.0,"Works as intended, screen printing is good (Image is clean and crisp).  Wife uses it daily."
5.0,"Fits well. Great to wear with new dress shoes so they don't rub so badly. I am a size 7.5 shoe. Has clear elastic/rubber all the way around on the inside to help them stay in place, not just the heal. Have washed them in washer and dryer with no problems. You can feel the little flower shape grippers on the bottom when you are wearing shoes but it was not very noticeable and didn't bother me."
5.0,My husband owns 2 GTOs & is President of our local Pontiac Club.  He gets a lot of use out of this stylish key ring & loves it!
5.0,"Love these so much. They have the perfect amount of sparkle to catch your eye. The pink one almost completely blends into my tongue, but I like this because i can hide my piercing from my family."
5.0,Feels good and heavy I like the style of the submariner. I recommend getting a kit to fit this watch to size but once you do it it’s perfect I ordered 3 others with different styles
5.0,Just what I needed and wanted. They work great and are polarized which is so important.
5.0,Good quality and perfect size for new piercing. I have very sensitive ears to any kind of cheap quality metals and my ears have responded very well to these. Would buy again for sure.
5.0,Lo utilizo para la venta
5.0,Love love love these
5.0,"Looked great, works well, my Dad liked it!"
5.0,Exceldnt
5.0,"Fits well, kept sun off her face."
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous. I needed it for a play during the 1950's, but I plan on wearing it after the play is over."
5.0,Such a great material!! Durable and not flimsy! It even sheltered my skin from the immediate impact of cold water.. which was soo different than other bathing suits I've ever brought... with that being said- it's like that rough ugly material- it was perfect! I brought it for my honeymoon along with the lace featured in the pictures and I'm really glad I did!!
5.0,Nice hat looks nice and shade sun.
5.0,Fits perfect!! I wear an XL and I ordered an XL. It is well made and will keep me very warm when I go to HP world this winter!!
5.0,"I love them, they are exactly like the picture and are really good quality. Customer service was wonderful as well, definitely a good buy"
5.0,"Earrings look and feel expensive, great quality for price!"
5.0,I love this jacket. It is so comfy and warm. I wear it on my long winter walks in Illinois. As we know in Illinois these are cold winter months. There were time I've got overheated in 40 degree weather when wearing my jacket. I like it so much a brought my sister a jacket and she loves hers.
5.0,"The color was perfect, I needed more of a sparkling navy blue than a royal blue and it delivered a true beautiful navy blue color with shine and the length not to long as I thought."
5.0,My husband loves the wallet.. it holds alot of cards and it folds nicely.. when he first got it cards were alittle tight but after a few days it became no problem cute packaging too
5.0,Used it for fall pics with our 7 year old. He loves it!
5.0,My girl loves it and she looks so amazing in it
5.0,"Super cute, especially the blue<br />Lens one!"
5.0,I bought this dress for my little sister for a wedding. It fits her great and she loves it a lot! She cannot wait to wear it this weekend. There was no issue with the fit at all. It was a little long but we are all short at 5’ even so this is a running problem and not the companies fault at all!
5.0,Super cool shorts. Got these for my son for his bday. Having a let’s taco bout a party n these are perfect for our swimming taco party
5.0,"I truly like these shorts, they are light and very comfortable, the only recommendation is that the rear pocket should be bigger in order to accommodate the larger phones but other than that the shorts are great, i strongly recommend them."
5.0,"Lovely item!! Fast delivery! Plus, just as described!"
5.0,This is the Most Powerful Handheld fan Ever! It has 3 Speeds. Great Value!
5.0,Super cute! Arrived as pictured!
5.0,Pretty good. Its loud but has to be worn way down your ears to hear anything. It's kind of hard to get bluetooth to sync but once you do it's all good. I would not jog with this on as it does slip making it hard to hear the music.
5.0,I like this shirt so much that I ordered a second one in a different color. I were these with my skorts  (also from Amazon). The material is not too thin and size large fit me just right. For references I am 5‘8 and 163 lbs. The most important aspect of this shirt for me is that the arm opening is not so large like in other armless shirts. There is no wide gap and doesn’t show the bra. I am not a golfer but like to wear this shirt because it is airy and comfortable to wear in the Florida heat.
5.0,This looks adorable on my fashionista grandson.
5.0,Got it so I could have something cute but comfy to wear during the hot summer months while pregnant and I love it! Fits just how I expected!
5.0,"Beautiful watch band.  Genuine leather, a little stiff but broke in nicely.  Beautiful color.  Time will tell how it holds up."
5.0,I purchased this for someone else but when it arrived I was impressed. It is something I would definitely recommend to others
5.0,Love it and it fits great!
5.0,This ring was a big hit!  My daughter loves this ring.
5.0,Great quality! Still wear them after 2 years still in great shape!
5.0,"Nice quality, but the 3XL is a little snug on a 44DD girl."
5.0,"Fit perfectly, my girls loved it."
5.0,"$50 bucks for a watch that looks like a $5,000 watch. It's beautiful! I'm considering this a costume piece to finish an outfit, because I wouldn't actually expect it to perform at that price-- however, it has been performing so far. Not only that, but hte day/night dial complication actually works, as do the day of week and date dial. They provide a need little pin pusher to action the side buttons. I'm not sure how they make any money on this watch-- I'm not sure I want to. I'll update after I've had it a while. Super cool!!! Strong recommend if you are looking for a good looking piece. As to dependability I'm not expecting anything, but again I'll update later."
5.0,Bello se lo di a mi hija y se ve el color bello
5.0,This was gift and it was well received .
5.0,Been buying these the past 3 years for my son to wear with AFOs. As expected!
5.0,great quality T shirt
5.0,Looks great fits perfect as well
5.0,"I am 5'8"", 232 lbs, with most of my extra weight in the belly. 2x fits loose but not too loose, looks nice, feels great and modest length, barely above the knee. 1x probably would be fine too for more form fitting. Pockets are deep and properly placed. Drawstring is a plus!"
5.0,My daughter picked the bracelet as a present for her friend's birthday.  We are very happy with it and look forward to ordering more with your generous discount.  Thank you.

Prefect fit for me, got me an Asian head, so wide-ish head and flatish nose.<br /><br />For the price, I don't need to worry about scratching or losing them on a ride. Haven't had a legit rock strike yet so don't know about the shatterproofing. No noticeable interference with helmet."

5.0,As described. Fun dress.
5.0,Great product size! Each bandana are nice and large. Also the hem edges are well stitched
5.0,Very light weight but decent for the price. The fit is good other than around the middle where it buttons. A bit too tight and I’m not a fat guy. Just sayin’. Larger size would probably be too long in the arms and too big in the shoulders.
5.0,I love this clutch! It matches perfectly with the shoes I am wearing to a wedding in the near future.  The colors provided are true to color and I am very pleased.  It fits everything I would need to put in a purse.
5.0,Great time turner and not $60 because it’s “officially licensed”. Passed my daughters test and she loved it.  Highly recommend
5.0,great quality shirt!
5.0,"Its so adorable, I love it ."
5.0,Me encanto salió tal y como yo quería
5.0,"I received a Defective Product. However I was contacted via email by Sojos, and offered to give me a new pair of Sunglasses. Although it wasn't the same one I ordered previously, let me tell you, they're customer service is AWESOME. I really appreciate them looking out for their customers. Thank you so much. I will enjoy my new sunglasses. 😘😍👍😎"
5.0,Loved these slippers. They were so fun and cute. Yet they did not last as long as I wanted them too. But I don’t regret buying them!
5.0,"Love it ,"
5.0,Bought for vacation bc it’s water resistant but now I Use for going out it so cute
5.0,"These are NOT fashion gloves.  I bought these gloves to keep my fingers and hands warm when I walk my dog.  Because I have poor circulation in my fingers, the cold makes them painful.  I think my search has finally ended.  These gloves are warm and fit well.  One finger is  little long, but I do not expect them to fit like a leather glove."
5.0,Very useful bag with thick straps - makes carrying heavy shopping much easier...
5.0,No complaints; fit as expected.
5.0,Fast shipping. Great price. Comfortable. Would buy again!
5.0,I purchased this item as a gift and she really loved it! Very pretty!
5.0,I got this item and wore it while in Disney World in 2016. It makes a lovely rainbow effect and pleasant chiming at main gate of Epcot and I think a few other locations in that park as well. I embellished mine with a few more flowers so mine is not quite so pretty but it is going back with me again this year as a back up to my newer Magic Band2. I honestly would wear it again but we have purchased Mermory Maker and I know they say the battery life is only 2 years for  the distant automatic ride images. Otherwise your magic bands nearly never stop working and can be worn even while swimming.
5.0,"This watch is sturdy, gorgeous, with a Victorian flare to it.  I love it!!!  I have small wrists for a woman and found this piece too large to wear on my left wrist but my right one is a touch bigger so I wear it there.  I am very pleased with this purchase and hope to be wearing this watch for many years to come."
5.0,I love the pattern on this tie...there are so many colors that it can go with any shirt.  High quality and terrific looking.  The price was perfect for a tie you’ll probably wear once a year.  A definite buy!
5.0,This pair was a little wider than my others. I have Mayra in 3 colors.Just a quirk of Old Gringo as far as I'm concerned. I love Old Gringo even though I prefer all leather soles and stacked wood heels.
5.0,Softest place on earth. Love the feel and fit!!!
5.0,Bought for a friend of my wife.
5.0,This product it’s excellent
5.0,"These SATINATO Women's Ankle Pants are stretchy and have a wealth of sturdy flat-hook fasteners along the fly. They are snug on a 5' 5"" tall, 130-135 lb. woman, and leave a bit of leg showing wearing ankle boots. The model in the pic typically wears a size 6 in pants, so perhaps these run slightly small."
5.0,"This came in today, and I was so thrilled with it and how fast it arrived! The blue is so vibrant without being too much. I got it for my helix piercing, and it was the perfect size, and the post fit comfortably in my ear. And, yes, mine was titanium as advertised. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to rate long term wear, because as I was struggling to get the top on (it’s small and I have nails), the top popped away into the unknown depths of my room. So sad because it was exactly what I wanted."
5.0,Very satisfied with my belts. Great quality. Great assortment of colors. I couldn't be happier!
5.0,My dad loves it
5.0,Will match every coat and now I am ready for winter!
5.0,Sturdy metal fit well
5.0,5 stars just wish they offered a bigger size for my ring finger
5.0,"It's a nice shirt. It's pretty thin but feels nice. The length is also very nice, much longer then many other shirts."
5.0,Great looking and does the trick.  My son loves it.
5.0,Wife likes them. Speedy service
5.0,"I'm very picky when it comes to jewelry. If it's not love on first wear I'll probably never wear it again. I got this bad boy yesterday and am wearing it as I type this review. My style is very into the modern, dark colors, edgy, rocker-grunge and this ear cuff fit right into what I am going for. Small and dainty I don't even feel it on my ear. I forget I'm wearing it until I accidentally touch it. Stays put and looks awesome next to a lot of my silver tone jewelry. Customer service is very attentive and caring. No complaints and all good vibes, five stars for sure for quality product and service for a regular shopper on a budget :)"
5.0,These are lovely! I bought them for my mom for Christmas and I'm going back to get some for me! Great look and perfect size!
5.0,"I used this with my Garmin Vivomove HR and it looks great. A little stiff at first, but it breaks in quickly and I wore this during my wedding."
5.0,Fit great.  Very happy!
5.0,Super Value<br /><br />I don't know of a better deal for 5 cotton (95%) sweat absorbing headbands for under $8.00.  Highly recommended for runners/joggers.
5.0,"Comfortable,stays on."
5.0,"I am 5'10"", 38D, about 170 lbs.  I ordered the XL and although it's slightly too short it's still a good fit.  We tall girls have had to put up with this our whole lives so this didn't surprise or disappoint.  I also had to take in the chest area a little as I wore a sticky bra and had a little extra room -- easy fix though and well worth it.  The  quality is very good for the price and the belt it comes with is absolutely wonderful as it helps hide tummy issues.  Love love love!!"
5.0,LOVE this dress it’s so cute! I wore it as a maternity dress and I still wear it postpartum.
5.0,"Great hat, seems to be of good quality, and the price cannot be beat!!  Amazing deal."
5.0,Perfect belt
5.0,I like I going use it for a sweet 15 party thanks
5.0,"It is sturdy, comparatively easy to carry than plastic bags, easy to pack and store in the closet."
5.0,"This dress is beautiful! I am 5’3 and 125lbs and ordered a small. The waist band is a little too loose so I will take it in a little bit on each side. Also, if you’re very chesty, the top will be somewhat see through."
5.0,"I wanted a simple green opal necklace that I could wear every day.  This is simple, yet just beautiful and a gorgeous green,  Very vibrant.  I highly recommend this necklace as a special treat for yourself or someone else.  You won't be disappointed!  : )  I am one very happy customer!"

5.0,Very very dark but perfect for pool side! Wouldn't drives with these on lol but they are vacation worthy! Love them!
5.0,"These are great. I can wear all day and not be overheated and it does not fog my glasses. If they would have a package of plain colors like black, navy, white, cream, etc., I would buy that too so I don't clash with my outfits that have patterns."
5.0,"Not too sparkly to look fake. nice color, great price!"
5.0,Love the purple color. Very comfortable and true to size. Purchasing another.
5.0,Great product. Has helped me to be able to be in high heels for a longer period of time without my feet hurting especially the balls of my feet.
5.0,Love this. It's hard to find long sleeved leotards with attached short bottoms on them. Plus it is extra cute. My daughter gets complimented on it all the time at gymnastics. Fits her perfectly.
5.0,I did not expect this quality for the price.
5.0,My wife is very happy with this necklace. The pearls are flawless and the the overall look is very exactly as I hoped it would be.  Highly recommended.
5.0,"This sweater is so cozy and soft, much softer than I was expecting from a poly/cotton blend!  The sizing was spot on for what I was expecting.  The sweater is very warm and it looks nice on.  I think this will get a lot of use.  The gray color was very close to what the product picture indicated.  Overall, this is a nice sweater for the price.  I think it looks like it is much more expensive than it is.  You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,Totally cute.  I am gifting these for Christmas.
5.0,"Love these sunglasses. I ordered a second pair in another color. Cute, great price, fast shipping, and love the color changing."
5.0,"Oh these are beautiful on charm bracelets, necklaces and other crafts I have done"

5.0,It is obvious these are costume but still very pretty.
5.0,I like to go a little extra on Christmas Eve and this dress was perfect. Fun dress and I wore a crinoline soup for extra pouf.
5.0,This is original watch strap for our Casio watch.

5.0,"Excelente producto, un buen precio"
5.0,Comfy love them will buy agIn
5.0,"These glasses were purchased strictly as motorcycle glasses. They are large, so the cover more of the area around my eyes. That gives me excellent protection against bugs, and wind. The photochromic lens work well, though they do not get super dark. I like them because I can also use them at night. They are lightweight, and seem to be well built. I have worn them for about 60 miles on my motorcycle, at speeds up to 70 mph. They work very well for what I wanted. They also fit while I wear a helmet. I recommend these glasses."
5.0,"This cloth removes tarnish from gold like magic.<br />I haven't tried it on any other metals but I'm sure it works.  I actually used it to clean my gold teeth, and it took all the tarnish from smoking off, they shine like brand new."
5.0,Superior quality and fantastic deal. Absolutely recommend.
5.0,"bought for a teacher he loved them, nice product"
5.0,Item worked great for my needs and easy clean up.
5.0,"I love this dress!! I bought this originally in red a few years ago but the color ran after being washed if I remember correctly. Looked bad after and I just considered it a dud. Didn't even remember trying it on before until my husband said something (he remembers the weirdest stuff lol). Its good I always wash clothes before trying them on (even before corona) because some of these dresses weren't made right and fall apart in the wash. The dress I originally ordered for Christmas from the same company ended up having a hole in the arm after washing it in a garment bag on cold and hang drying it. This dress was supposed to be my Christmas eve dress,  but since I felt so beautiful in it, I decided to just wear it for Christmas and deal with everything after the holidays. I'm pregnant so I've been feeling whaleish lately and this dress lifted my spirits.  So glad I gave it a second chance in black. Washed it twice with no holes or issues and the fabric hardly wrinkles which was great when I packed it for Christmas. Looks classy with pearls and nude heels!!"
5.0,I got the charcoal dark gray and the fit is perfect.  Way more stretchy and flattering than the brand name version.<br /><br />I've tried Gymshark Vital 2.0 in M and L (i'm in between sizes).  Both were not comfy.  M waist too tight / Large crotch too baggy.  It was a bummer cause i loved the colour.<br /><br />So when Aoxjox said they were coming out with their version I had to try it.  These are a perfect middle.  The waist on these is slightly tapered but still comfy.  There's no gaping on me and these are squat proof on me too!  Much stretchier too and for the price it can't be beat.<br /><br />If you're like me and prefer the gymshark Vital 1.0 but had slight gaping..get these for sure.<br />I've already ordered the blue too!
5.0,"Top is a little large, but still cute."
5.0,Some of them stay in better then the Crocs brand. And for a quarter of their price.
5.0,Soft and comfortable. It also fit.
5.0,I can jump rope with this baby one! Perfect when you need to be tucked away.
5.0,They are very thick and cute
5.0,I love my robe.

5.0,"Love these socks, soft"
5.0,They are fantastic. I love them!
5.0,Beautiful we love it and hopefully so does our future son in law wrapping was good
5.0,Necklace is perfect. Wear it everyday and it’s still in perfect condition.
5.0,Great fit and style
5.0,"Ya know, everyone is allowed one douchey purchase every three months or so, and I needed to cash mine in before the next quarter came about and I saw these and I knew. They were perfect. I've always had glasses and used to have the overwear sunglasses you get at Walmart or something, but I recently got new frames and my sunglasses wouldn't fit anymore. And I couldn't just drive around with no sunglasses on in Wyoming where snow sticks around until July and reflects the sun directly into your retina. So to Amazon I went to scour for the perfect pair. Lo and behold, wayfarer style, mirrored, and polarized flip-up sunglasses that screamed equal parts douchey and ridiculous. Now I just need a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts and I'm the dad at the barbecue that tries to embarrass their children by thinking they're cool."
5.0,Amazing quality
5.0,"I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it so much!! It's clear to read, the light helps in the dark to read it and easy to program too. We highly recommend it."
5.0,they’re cute I wish they made more creative cute piercings like these.I got the ufo from body candy just in case anyone wants to buy it for themselves.
5.0,"It feels so comfortable, like walking on a cloud!  Sounds cheezy, but it is seriously comfortable.  The only thing that may be an issue once I start walking in them, is the triangle piece near my little toe may cause a sore spot.  We shall see.  It feels suspect.<br />It looks good, not cheap, fits very well (I wear a size 7, medium with).<br />I orignially was looking for white but I think this silver color will be a good white-substitute."
5.0,I love these pants.
5.0,Cool hat. Love the design; everyone loves it on me and it fits really nicely!
5.0,Love love just a tiny bit long for me.. i am 5&#34;1 and 120lbs i got size small fits great however i am short.. but i love the material
5.0,"Bought item because of special price.  Traditional simple indigo cotton.  New mitt for removing pet hair will come in handy.  It still looks nicer than some that are bigger, because the styling seems in some way more careful and flattering."
5.0,My husband had rotator cuff surgery and this shirt was a life saver for us! Great quality - Perfectly designed for easy access to the shoulder/arm area - 100% recommend for anyone going to PT for shoulder/arm rehab  - your therapist will thank you!
5.0,Very well made and looks amazing.  This necklace presents like the real thing.
5.0,Really nice tank tops. But they don't fit snug like it shows in the picture. But still my daughter loved them and they're very cute and the fabric is nice.

5.0,Soft and soooo cute!!
5.0,Like the way they feel and look
5.0,This dress looks just like a $50 one from Modcloth. As other reviewers suggested I ordered a smaller size than I normally wear. I usually wear a size 10-12 pants. The small fits perfectly! Love this dress!
5.0,"The rings fit as they should, and so far have held up while playing sports and working outside. Happy with the product and service."
5.0,This was perfect for my Maleficent costume so glad I got it Instead of actual wings
5.0,Very surprise with the quality of sweater. Felt in love with it
5.0,"My dad is on several medicines that in a emergency they need to be made aware of,  The company did a great job at engraving and the quality is really good.  Very happy with the product."
5.0,I gave each one of my kids a pair and they loved them!!!! Great fit and received quickly!
5.0,"I adore this! I gave my boyfriend three choices: this one, the husky, or the neon pink cat. He got me this one, and I just love it! Beyond it being absolutely precious and adorable, it fits great, is super soft, and is so warm.<br /><br />I haven't used the inner pocket (it's actually a little high up- like right under your chin), but I'm really glad it's there. I'm very tall and my hands are big, but they still fit in the mittens just fine. I'm usually wearing other gloves , so I use the mittens for my smartphone. I have the Nokia Lumia 1020, but the pockets would fit an even bigger one.<br /><br />I don't use the button to keep it shut when I'm just wearing it around my house, but it's been really helpful when driving to and from work with no heat in my car!<br /><br />I've always wanted to dress like a koala, and now I can. Best gift ever!"
5.0,Really helps for night driving. Can't beat the price!!
5.0,I brought this for a rainbow friends birthday party. It fit perfectly and the colors are vibrant.
5.0,I got these to wear at the hospital after labor. Tried them on and these are so comfortable and probably my favorite pair of pjs. Easy to breast feed in to.
5.0,Super Cute.  Perfect size for an 8 year old.  She loves them.
5.0,Cute if this is your look. I used as beater shades at the lake. Price is right.
5.0,"There awesome, it was what I was looking for, for the right price, thank you, I like them a lot."
5.0,The bands are that perfect silicone texture. The colors are true to the picture. The bands are a great size.
5.0,I love this dress! It’s light weight and flows and the pockets make it perfect. Can’t wait to wear it for my upcoming cruise. It will also be perfect for work this summer.
5.0,I was surprised how nice this Dress looks. For the money it is well made.I am 180 pounds a 5'&#34;4 and ordered a size XL fits perfectly.
5.0,"Arrived on time and great fit, good quality"
5.0,Great product fast delivery
5.0,"Stay in place for what I use them for, which is for shower in the gym."
5.0,I love this hat! I tried one on over the summer and had to get one.  It is wide brimmed and a med was loose on me. The small is snug I wear a 6 7/8 hat. I bought a small.

5.0,I love this coat so much!!!!! It is perfect!! Definitely recommend!! Perfect for the very cold days.
5.0,These are fantastic gloves.  Very soft.  Quick delivery
5.0,These are perfect!  They hug my foot like a second skin but they aren’t restrictive at all and they are very comfortable and soft. Also they do not shift around on your foot like some other brands. I wish they came in other styles or colors. I’d buy them all!
5.0,I'm 5'4 and a 34D. I read the questions and reviews and the medium fit perfect. I feel a small wouldn't have covered the girls as well. This is surprisingly well made and double layered. No padding but nipples do not show through at all. It hits me maybe an inch or 2 above the bellybutton. Super cute.
5.0,Just absolutely gorgeous!!!
5.0,Nice looking belt. Very easy to cut and adjust the length. I cut mine so the buckle was right in the middle of the section for the ratchet function. I bought two because they were a good bargain.<br />Would recommend.
5.0,"Nice fit, good quality…to size."
5.0,The first item they sent me had defective pin holders I received the new items and the pin hold strong
5.0,"Love these buffs! They're soft and expandable. I've purchased others in the past which were too tight to wear as a basic headband. I just find buffs, so versatile, very handy, light weight neck warmers plus the many styles as head coverings. And this package had so many great colors."
5.0,"I looked forever for a necklace stand that was tall, had a ton of hooks, wasn't shabby, and had a decent price tag. This necklace stand was all of those! Not to mention I didn't have to wait for it to get to my house; it felt as if I got it the very next day I ordered it. Amazing product!"
5.0,Love these shorts.  Comfortable and flattering.  The fabric feels so good.  Great buy
5.0,Very cute fit!  Hits at the knee and has a great A line shape.  The yellow material is thin so be careful with any printed undergarments because  you could see through but if you wear a nude color panty then that works!
5.0,Good product for the price. I liked that it comes with gems too.
5.0,given as a gift. Receiver loved it
5.0,Fits nice a little long but I expected that.
5.0,I love vintage looking brooches . It arrived on time and was well packaged. I have already worn it several times by itself and with scarves. I've gotten several compliments on it.
5.0,Love the detail!! Fits nicely.
5.0,It's good and very comfortable the design is great I recommend it
5.0,"The polo is made well. It is comfy, warm and stylish. I love it."
5.0,"I love these shoes! They are super soft and flexible, great for tiny feet. My baby is 9 months and the 0-6 fit her perfectly. I'm not sure if she just has tiny feet or if they just run big. She has a pair of size 2 tennis shoes that fit her, so I'd say these run slightly big. The only thing I would change is that there is no rubber grip on the bottom. My baby is a crawler and walks along furniture. She hasn't slipped yet, but it seems possible due to her unsteadiness at this stage."
5.0,"Great little belt for the price! I'm a size 10/12, hourglassy and this fit around my natural waist perfectly to belt a dress."
5.0,Fits perfect! Daughter loves it!
5.0,My daughter loves her Nike Air Force 1. On to the next pair 😉👊🏽
5.0,EXCELLENT SERVICE - RECEIVED PROMPTLY

5.0,Beautiful material looked just like the pics I just bought the wrong size
5.0,"Cuffs on ankles and 5% spandex keep legs from riding up. Fits comfortably. I may get a large next ti.e be a use I typically like very loose pjs. These are very comfortable, and a nice weight of cotton."
5.0,Loved this outfit. Comfortable and stylish. Fit is perfect. Wish it came in another color. Price is very good also.
5.0,"Very cute & comfy, very stretchy. Beautiful and flowy.I got many compliments! I am 5'6 I weigh 247 lbs usually wear 2x-3x depending the item. I personally like cloths that dont fit tight and feels comfortable. This dress fit great."
5.0,"Very pretty. This came exactly as pictured. The chain was a little short but in all fairness it was mentioned how long it was. This is a perfect gift for a younger girl. Or if you have a longer chain for yourself. It shipped super quick and came in a pretty red box. I did receive this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review. I would recommend this, especially if you have a younger girl in mind."
5.0,Amazing quality!  Good price!  Looks amazing!
5.0,Was nice finding this shorter length as I don't think it will be subject to getting broken as easily.  Grandkids like grabbing shiny things and I've had to replace a couple chains because of that.  Hopefully this will not be so easy to grab!
5.0,I adore these earrings. They are not too heavy so very comfortable. I wore to a wedding and got many compliments.
5.0,I do not recommend purchasing a size up. . these fit true to size.  I purchased up and wear them anyway. . with the added benefit that I can wear a long sleeve tissue tee in the late fall for a pop of colour.<br />The open shoulder is not really my style. . but the tee underneath solves that.
5.0,"Está muy lindo, suavecito y cómodo para mí bebé me encantó.."
5.0,"Definitely a value for your money, arrived quickly!"

5.0,Great pants for yoga
5.0,Wool hat is soft and keeps my head warm but not too warm.
5.0,"The expectation was minimal. Usually when you order something like this, it could go good or bad. I am happy to report....ALL GOOD!!!!! Very satisfied with the workmanship/printing. The jerseys they use fit perfectly and feel like silk! I ordered two different types of jerseys just to see which one I would like better. Call it ""doing some research"". Turns out BOTH are great products. On Par, if not better, than other vendors with higher prices. I have prototypes in my ""save for later"" queue ready to go in my cart for purchase. Was waiting on the initial shipment to see if I should delete or press the ""buy"" button. Definitely ""Buy""Highly recommended!"

5.0,Great umbrella.  Functions as expected.
5.0,"I have poor circulation in my feet and they are always cold, especially in the winter.  These socks fit just right and are easy to get on and off.  I like that the battery tucks into a little pocked on each sock and they do not get in the way.  They do keep my feet warm and the battery lasts a long time.  I do wish the socks would get a bit hotter, but realize that it's probably a safety issue.  I love these socks and I highly recommend them if you are looking for something to keep your feet warm.  One thing, I am not a walker or hiker, so my wear and tear pattern is sedentary."
5.0,These sandals (IMO) are great.  I volunteer at a nonprofit and spend 6 to 8 hours on my feet each shift.  My feet hurt less with these sandles than when I wear the  $100 orthotics sandals recomended by my foot specialist.
5.0,Extremely soft and warm. Sizing was perfect and the soles are sturdy. Looks well made and overall in love with them.
5.0,Cute charms!

5.0,Three of my grandchildren of different ages/genders found shoe charms that they liked in this selection. The shoe charms seem sturdy and the kids really enjoyed them!
5.0,"Exactly as described and shown in the photos. Great quality, especially for the price. Runs small- I got a medium and it fits tightly. My measurements are: Bust: 36.5&#34;, Waist: 30.5&#34;, Hips: 44&#34;. Worth the buy!"

5.0,Nice fits to size
5.0,Good quality laptop bag
5.0,I've been losing weight so bought the 2xl thinking that I would shrink into it if need be.  Fits now and will only get better as I lose a little more!  Love the shirt and how it looks.
5.0,"OMG I loveeeeeeeeee this dress!!!! I am 5'3&#34; 150lbs and I ordered a small, it fits great!!! A little big so it is comfy and flowy. I am ordering more in other colors! It also shipped out crazy fast! I had my order within a week of ordering it and I live in Guam!"

5.0,It's so cute! It fit a little large but that's ok! She can grow into it
5.0,Perfect for the professional job I have.  Pearls are my 'go to' jewelry for the office and these are terrific.  Look good and I've had no problem with them. I bought the bunch thinking if I'd lose one then I have a replacement but I've been wearing the same pair for two weeks with no problems or loss.
5.0,purchased for my granddaughter. She loves them.
5.0,I really like this. The jewelry is really cheap but I didn't buy it for that and it would have looked cute. It gave me an idea to make my own. I usually wear an XL T-Shirt. I don't think a XXL could get away with it though.
5.0,Easy to put on and good looking
5.0,"Quality material, construction, and design and fits normally."
5.0,"Small but cute. Don't recommend if you fiddle with your septum, the corners on mine irritate my nose when I fiddle."

5.0,This belt is awesome. I love that you can slightly adjust the waist size by pushing the release button.  It’s wonderful after a big lunch. LOL!  It’s very comfortable because of such small size increments.  And it’s a good looking leather belt.

5.0,It makes me look slimmer
5.0,"Very, very nice dress!  Very nice for the price<br />The fabric is a little thin, but not see thru.<br />Looks very sophisticated on. It almost looks like I put more effort in my appearance than I actually do. It's easy to wear, it hides all my body imperfections.<br />It's such a nice dress I bought 3 of this dress in different patterns."
5.0,Wow! So many compliments on this $10 dress! I ordered a large even though I normally wear a size M or 6. It was a little loose but fit fine. I love the classic look it has. Very comfortable and the wrap design in the front really covers any mid-section tummy issues/bulge.
5.0,It’s perfect.  Just as expected
5.0,I'm wearing them right now..... believe it or not the earrings are much shinier with a better looking finish and MUCH prettier than the photo here online makes them look.....these pair are a must have...I love these earrings. :)
5.0,Bought these for my son's birthday goodie bags. I couldn't believe how many came in the order. They were so much fun to play with.
5.0,"This was an awesome dress, My little one loved it."
5.0,Good value for the cost
5.0,"Very cute, and comfortable"
5.0,I liked how light they are it's like a plastic material
5.0,"I ordered a Large, and I am usually in between a M and a L, and like my clothes to fit SLIGHTLY loose. This was PERFECT. The fabric is so soft, and doesn't cling to your body. I also have a white dog, and magically this (I ordered black) did NOT suck up all the hair. I have already worn it twice since I've purchased it last week.  I am short, at 5'1&quot; and the bottom hits right below my hips, so it is perfect to wear with leggings for someone of my stature. I will definitely purchase more in different colors!"
5.0,My wife loves this shirt! For reference she is 5' 5&#34; and 130lbs. The white material is not see through and is a good quality. Much nicer shirt than we were expecting so she's actually been wearing it more so for nice occasions versus just around the house.
5.0,"Great fix, material feels soft and smooth. Washed before use and it held up well in washing machine. Would definitely recommend. I'm 5.7, 120 pounds and got the small. Fix perfect."
5.0,"worked great , i used on a cub cadet"
5.0,I bought this to have engraved on the back for a very special Gdpa who lost his gdson at only 7 urs old🙏🏻 He was a true little farmer and knew about as much or more then some farmers! He was a special little boy❤️🙏🏻
5.0,I am obsessed with this dress and got so many compliments! I ordered medium when I am normally a small in long dresses; I am 4'11 135lbs with a 36C bust. I am glad I ordered a size up like other reviews said! If you are taller I would maybe consider two sizes up or it will be ankle length instead of floor length.
5.0,"It's sturdy, well made and very pretty. I was worried it may look cheap, but it's beautiful. Worth every penny."
5.0,"as expected, good quality for the price"
5.0,"Perfect sizing, super comfy and great colors!"

5.0,Fit and feels comfortable
5.0,Very nice colors. Good quality and durable.
5.0,"I had to make a few adjustments to this dress because I’m really small. But I think if you were an average sized person, and not a 20 year old who looks like a 12 year old child, the dress is pretty true to size. Wore it to my sorority’s formal and had so many compliments! If you’re looking for a cheap and classy dress, I highly recommend!"
5.0,"My only issue with it is the belt is a tiny bit short.  But I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it.  The fit is great, for me.  If you are tall this may not be the jumpsuit for you. Oh and the color is perfect.  So vibrant.  There is the cutest button detail on the back.  I don't know if I can update this review, but if so I will upload pictures after I wear it next week."
5.0,"First time buying these, they are awesome"
5.0,nice wallet. exactly how the picture is.
5.0,"Super comfy & so pretty. Nice & roomy, could be palazzos if I pull out the ankle elastic."
5.0,Does the job I need it to do! Very happy with these headbands. Use them during my boxing classes and keeps the sweat out of my eyes.
5.0,"Leggins are a little tighter than usual but its not too tight, I really love the quality of the leggins as well, high rise and do not lower down when I move"
5.0,"not stretchy material, would size up if you’re unsure"

5.0,Looks exactly as pictured!
5.0,"Such a cool jacket! Has seams at the elbows that make bending them a little uncomfortable in the crook of the arm, but fit is perfect...a gorgeous and great motorcycle jacket."
5.0,Came on time and is super bright
5.0,I am usually disappointed with how sizing fits with some swimsuits.  this particular swimsuit fit true to size and was gorgeous on.  the ties add a cute look to the swim suit.
5.0,My boyfriend was very happy with this hat! It was just a tad too large but it still worked out perfect! (He has a medium sized head)
5.0,Nice price super fast delivery

I plan to buy all the colors you can get on these bags! I love how light they are and how much room they have!"
5.0,"This dress is a great buy for the price. I got so many compliments on it and was super comfortable in it.  I wore it to a wedding, the reception, and the dance.  I love it!"

5.0,Awesome scrub top!!
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits perfectly.."

5.0,These boots are so cute and comfortable.
5.0,"I bought this for my wife to wear to the store so she can read dates on food. She loves it, works well & is very nice looking."
5.0,"I now have four pairs, two for each of us. Best winter gloves I've found yet. Even better than my electrified ones. Very comfortable  and warm even at the lowest we've experienced lately  -3F degrees. They take up room in your pocket, but a small price to pay. For warmth they beat out all of the many big brand names I've tried."
5.0,Love this shoe an so does my daughter
5.0,Comfortable and very warm. Will buy again.
5.0,So cool to be different and with style
5.0,Super cute and the biggest size fit a size 12 perfectly.
5.0,"Love, love, love the Myra bags. I have four in different sizes and designs. They are interesting and very well made. Great quality."
5.0,The metal screw-ring around handle is a real PLUS--Much better than straps or one-use plastic ties.
5.0,they were a gift
5.0,I attend daily aquatics class.  This suit is not only attractive but perfect for the class.  It stays put on my body.  It is comfortable and flattering.
5.0,Great construction of the item. Plus fast shipping was a bonus but the compliments I get from my friends for this product is a deal breaker alone and the price is so reasonable for this kind of quality that I would definitely recommend this product.
5.0,I ordered this for my boyfriend and he loved it! It’s larger than you may expect but not gaudy. It is noticeable and perfect for letting your light shine.
5.0,The ball is super soft and just the right size. I love it!
5.0,Exactly how is pictured - quality is so good for the price! Love them - great extra pair to keep in your purse!
5.0,"Im VERY pleased with how this fit, it was incredibly flattering as I have broad shoulders and the neckline draws your eye to a different focus. I am 5""3, and normally wear a size 14, I ordered the XL."
5.0,"Fit like a glove, extremely lightweight and don’t absorb water. I have them in my gym bag."
5.0,Was fast and exactly what I wanted. I would definitely recommend buying.
5.0,"It's awesome, light, and looks sweet. My only complaint is I don't think it's worth the $80 I paid for it. I'd pay $60 or $50"
5.0,You really don't get exactly how sparkly these earrings are from the picture. They look great. You do have to take care when connecting the back portion to the front. The stud part of the earring tends to slip around the back locking portion. When you get the earring locked on you can adjust the tightness some what by squeezing the earring or gently pulling on the back.
5.0,This is so cute and very good quality I loveeeee it ❤️
5.0,"These bikini bottoms are so cute! Fit perfectly, really stretchy, very easy to put on, and very lightweight and comfortable. Perfect for the beach!"
5.0,"This coat is amazing, great price. It definitely keeps me warm “Pittsburgh weather” definitely for the cities that get super cold. I was so warm in it. Fur is removable but I like it better on. I’m 5’5 and ordered a xl because I wear a sweater or hoodie underneath. It stops right above my knees. Like I said if you’re somewhere where it gets really cold you will be warm in this coat. Very cute I got the olive green and I love it."
5.0,"I wore this for a wedding rehearsal and dinner. I got so many compliments! Vintage is definitely “in” and this dress is beautiful! I'm 5'4, 135 lbs and the small fit perfectly. I was a little worried that the bust area of the dress would be too small, but I think this dress may run a tad large. Either way it didn't end up being a problem. The only frustrating part of the entire process was having to iron the dress before wearing."
5.0,My son ware this to my daughters wedding and he looked great
5.0,they are sexy
5.0,I love the sheerness of the pants.  I have worked out in them and they are awesome.  I don’t have anything negative to say I just absolutely love them.
5.0,There is nothing not to like about this product. It looks like a very expensive sterling silver chain. I love that.
5.0,"Eye glass case appears to be of high quality. It is attractive, keeps my glasses safe, and fits nicely in my purse"
5.0,Love ❤️ love it
5.0,Works great to hold my daughter's glasses on. Tired others without luck. These are perfect for us!
5.0,adorable.  will be mailing them today.
5.0,Good product. Just it would be too small if I didn’t buy size up. Kid on the pic is 2 size is 3-4. Everything else is good and worth the price
5.0,"Arrived on time! Shirt was a good fit, and matched what it looked like on-line, even the color! It’s a fun shirt to wear to casual events."
5.0,Perfect Color & weight & length
5.0,My Grandson loved it and said it had everything he wanted
5.0,Love Carters. This sleep and play is adorable. I've washed it many times....and still looks like new. I live the pink unicorn design.
5.0,"Comfortable, great fit. What more can you want?"
5.0,My granddaughter loves it!!!!
5.0,Great pair!
5.0,"I bought this pair before my vacation in the Caribbean.  They look really nice (not cheap looking at all) and I've been complemented on them (which was rare for me).  It did a great job of protecting my eyes from the sun as I laid out on the beach and made me look great at the same time!  I have a pair of ray-bans also, but I'm a little more protective of those.  I use these very freely and not worry about losing them or damaging them, so I end up wearing these more than my ray-bans!"
5.0,I have ordered several Siggi hats.  This one is my fav because it's normal size.  Others have shown up way oversize.  I wish sizes were consistent with this brand.
5.0,"I am in love with this jacket!<br />It has everything I want in a windbreaker. The most important features are the elastic waist and wrists.<br />Too many so-called windbreakers don't have them; without those elastics, the wind gets right in.<br />Seeing that it had them was the thing that made me give it a try. When I first tried it on, I immediately loved it. It fits perfectly and has nice deep pockets that zipper shut. It even has a zippered pocket on the left arm that's great for storing cash and cards. It also has a mid-weight lining that's a big help when it's colder. Everything on it feels nice and sturdy. I have faith that I won't be dealing with broken zippers anytime soon. It has two inside pockets that are actually the hand pockets for the reversible side.<br />Because they are slant pockets, they are great at keeping items from falling out.<br />The jacket is very comfortable and great looking. The flag is a velcro patch and can easily be removed or replaced with something else. But I'm very happy displaying the flag.<br />I can't find a single bad thing to say about this jacket. Even the price is great."
5.0,I loved it so much that I came back and bought one in every color. I wear it to work under suits and kimonos. At home I wear it with jeans and shorts
5.0,"If you like this type of watch band , this one is very good."
5.0,Very cute and exactly what I expected!
5.0,Love it!! So comfortable and elegant
5.0,I have these on all my running shoes. Have arthritis and these stretch. Love them
5.0,Really happy with the quality of this product. All the tools to custom fit your band were also included. I replaced a leather band I did not like and am very happy. The weight is heavy enough to know you have a watch on but not too bulky.
5.0,Keep one next to my phone.<br />Very handy.
5.0,"So delicate and feminine, I love this anklet.  It is beautiful, I'm a little afraid to wear it 24/7, as I've had a couple break catching on the blankets at night.  It is truly a lovely piece."
5.0,"Very pretty, fast shipping"
5.0,"Cute dress, cheap price and quick shipping"
5.0,My grandson will love this! He loves snacks & the Star Wars character fits right in.
5.0,Good product -- great delivery
5.0,Fit well and good quality.
5.0,My daughter love's it
5.0,Very easy to add or remove items. Looks expensive for a small price. The extra loops is a nice touch
5.0,Great purse----so easy to be organized.  Wish there were more colors----waiting for red or pink to come back in.
5.0,Definitely Blue light blockers. I was playing PS4 looked down and thought my controller had shut off. If you’re not aware the light iS blue. Best part you look like Mike Ditka and the entire world around you looks like a Miami summer 1984
5.0,This mask was really comfortable and stuck securely to my face all night!
5.0,"Super sturdy compared to others that I ordered off of amazon, and I was able to figure out how to put it on immediately. No hoops to jump through, &#34;pun intended.&#34; This item also shipped quicker than expected, which was a plus!"
5.0,My husband gets complimented every time he wears these. He is long waisted so I thought they looked like they would be too short but they are perfect. Will probably order again.
5.0,Very pleased with this product and would recommend it.
5.0,I liked the design is a Birthday present got to me in perfect time
5.0,"Hello, shipping was very quick, packaging was done very well, and product was true to description. This would be recommended to anyone else to purchase, and if another one would be needed, would most definitely purchase again!!!"
5.0,"Jumpsuits are a great way to look put together without much effort. The fabric is soft and very stretchy like a t-shirt. There's a tie at the waist that is purely decorative. If you have a shorter torso, you can fold the fabric at the waist and cover it with a belt. The fit is true to size. For reference, I'm 5'6"", 162lbs and a 34G bra size. The medium fit well.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."
5.0,"This umbrella is certainly small. I would say less than 12 inches in it's compressed state. It does expand into what I would say is a standard sized umbrella. I like that feature since lugging around a full sized one can be awkward. I live in a high wind state, so I took it out side to see how it faired, I think it did okay, but with some of the stronger gusts I did feel like I was being jerked around a little. One of the features it had me rate is it's function as a ""sun protection"" and I would say it's about as effective as any standard umbrella...which is not very much. I would suggest a golf or beach umbrella for that purpose."
5.0,This dress is very sexy! I returned only because I wasn’t as brave as I thought I was lol. It’s very nice tho. Quality was good.
5.0,i like the soft gray. v neck and long sleeves
5.0,"Item as pictured, arrived way ahead of schedule. Great deal"
5.0,Nice and beautiful
5.0,"Beautiful, modest, not expensive, well made dress!  It's hard to find a modest dress in the store and it takes a lot of effort trying to modify a dress.  This dress is everything my daughter was liking for and she loves it!"
5.0,Will buy again!
5.0,Beautiful and flowey!
5.0,Favorite leggings for the price.

5.0,Adorable. Except it doesn’t have a tail.
5.0,I saw this and knew it was exactly what I needed for my granddaughter.  She absolutely loves Taylor Swift and even has tickets to her concert in MI this summer.<br /><br />She loves the necklace and put it on immediately!!
5.0,Love them wish you had more colors!
5.0,"I can't attest to the durability, but the Five Fingers fits well and is enjoyable to wear."
5.0,Perfect. Works as intended. No issues or complaints.
5.0,"Llegaron antes de la fecha,  me quedaron perfectos buena tela gracias Amazon"

5.0,Buy this dress! it's amazing
5.0,"I had lost the last one I got from amorwing which I loved! So I had to buy another one my wrist feels naked without it! I cant get enough of their products 😍 so well made,  durable. Definitely you get your money worth with a amorwing! Plus they ship in nice boxes! You guys rock!!!"
5.0,This is very pretty and nice material. I will be wearing this as a duster/cardigan at my baby shower. UPDATED with photos.
5.0,Received it quickly and love it . Well made .
5.0,Wanted this since my community brass band's colors are purple and black - was excited to find a hat with lights - was exactly what I needed!
5.0,Very cute! I get a lot of compliments on them. The only negative is that the case came damaged but I don't really care about that.
5.0,Loved the material and design.
5.0,Beautiful Watch
5.0,A perfect fit for comfortable work/dress socks!
5.0,Great overall value
5.0,"I was actually worried about the color but it came as it looked on the pics. I like the cloth material, not itching and soft and the design is Plain and can be used to wear outside and inside of the house."
5.0,great for the summer
5.0,"my sister loved this set, and so did I. pretty."
5.0,"Good presentation, nicely boxed"
5.0,"Very nice jewelry for the price. Returns and exchanges are easy, too."
5.0,"Very nice, well worth the money."
5.0,"The fishtail skirt is ADORABLE.  I purchased a large (my waist is 28 inches and hips are 38 inches) and it fits great. I have some fishtail skirts that are difficult to walk in but this one is no problem whatsoever.  It really hugs my curves in a tasteful way so it can be worn to the office as well as date night. The hem has a little black lace ruffle which gives the illusion that it’s a slip “peeking” out at the bottom.  My husband even made a comment that the lace ruffle made the skirt look “flirty”.  Although the description says it’s a “grey grid” pattern mine is more black and ivory, which I prefer over grey.  Because of the neutral colors it can be paired with almost any color top, shoes and purse. I wish they made this skirt in every color of the rainbow! I received this item at a reduced rate for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,Fits as expected. Great color lavender. Comfortable band that snaps very securely to the fit bit. Slight difference in the fitbit brand band but not worth worrying about so far.
5.0,"Colors were different, but we still love it"
5.0,This top was even prettier in person. It is light and sheer so don't expect it to keep you warm but it looks very pretty over a tee or tank or as a swimsuit cover.
5.0,"Great quality product. Perfect big bag. We looked at backpacks for days before she finally chose this one. I was okay spending a little more on the bag she really wanted. It came with a bunch of little accessories, the stickers are awesome! She made her water bottle match her bag :)"
5.0,"I got this blouse for my wife, and she absolutely loves it. She said it is extremely comfortable and flowing. The wine red color is gorgeous. The seams are well sewn, and the material is smooth and soft. The blouse hangs below her belly and hips, which is how she likes them. It fits true to size for her in XXL. She also likes the fact that the washing instructions are actually printed on the inside back of the top as opposed to on a tag, since sometimes tags poke her or become stiff over time. The only negative with this tunic top is that it will collect pet hair and lint. We have a long- haired cream colored cat who sheds year 'round, so if my wife is going out somewhere, she has to put this blouse on at the last minute and then stay away from the cat or any furniture the cat's been on. She said it's a small price to pay for such a beautiful, comfortable top, however."
5.0,Looks great and a wonderful addition to the room.
5.0,The reason I bought this was because it was called stars or Galaxy pattern. I just had to have it. Plus it boosted my girls.
5.0,I’m pretty happy with these. I purchased them for a bunch of children just learning to ski. They fit them all for the price good quality
5.0,Good quality. Product as described.
5.0,Good support for a flip-flop

5.0,"My order arrived quickly and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The purse is a great size very roomy and has lots of compartments .  It is beautiful, highly recommend purchasing it and it's a great price."
5.0,Just as it looks in the picture. I love it!
5.0,"Over all the presents from us and family this was my son's favorite Christmas gift!! He is 2, so it's a bit big, but I knew it would be. It's cute, well-made, and functional. He uses it around the house for play, and when we go to stay at family's. It's awesome for him to put his toys and water bottle in there, and carry it around. And when we go out of town to stay at family's it is great that I can back a bag for his clothes and things, and he can have some control over the fun things he bring, and he has the security of having some things that he loves in a new environment.  It gives him a sense of purpose and independence that he can take charge of his own things! And the buckle is easy enough for him to buckle, and unbuckle. My youngest is only 8 months, but I'm already hoping we can get him one in a different color when he is bigger!"
5.0,Loved it perfect do
5.0,I love my cotton robe! Was really excited to find this style of robe in cotton. Very comfortable and great quality.

5.0,Great way to tastefully display autism acceptance and understanding.
5.0,"This is a nice pair of pants, perfect for Boy Scouts.  It goes great with his uniform.  They are made well and fit as expected.  they are quick dry, which is also nice.  UPF 50+ is good for camping as well.  Great pants for hiking/camping, even if you aren't a scouter.  Great color.  Made well."
5.0,Product is consistent with the picture. I got Aquarius in gold.
5.0,I love it!  It looks great.  The only bad experience I had was with bees. I was stung 3 times on the back because the bees were drawn to the bright colors.  I still love it and will wear it.
5.0,I love this dress! Very well made! I didn’t expect it to fit so well! Absolutely elegant and gorgeous!
5.0,Love the material and feel. Fits well
5.0,loves it  great price.
5.0,Very light and nice.
5.0,Good quality and as pictured. My daughter looks adorable in them.
5.0,"I am so glad that I chose these. I was worried because I am not tall like a lot of the girls who left reviews.  Like most people, I sized up because I was worried that the fabric wouldn't have enough give to fit over my thighs.  They actually have a good amount of stretch, BUT the material is thin (I can see through from the inside if I hold them up to the light) so if you are curvier, you might want to plan accordingly.  Sizing up did make them more comfortable in the leg, but the waist is pretty loose and I am sure they will fall quite a bit if I am dancing or moving around a lot.  I am 5'1, 112lbs, with a soft body and no butt.  They weren't terribly long and would probably look normal on most girls under 5'6&#34;.  I repeat, I have NO butt so the waist was very high, which is exactly what I wanted.  I doubt these hold up well over time, but I bought it for my Halloween costume and am very excited.  I actually think the teal looks prettier than a green would (which is what I originally wanted).  I hope other short girls find this useful!"
5.0,"Great Dress, oredered a meduim and it fit as expected"
5.0,Great product great price
5.0,"Overall I like the dress but it runs big. Depending on the dress I typically wear a small sometimes a medium. I orders a small and it's definetly to big. I still like it enough to go ahead and order an extra small. The material is super stretchy and I LOVE that. I absolutely LOVE this company, they are quick to help in anyway. They have AWESOME customer service. I would definetly recommend and will be a repeat customer for sure :)"
5.0,fit good and are nice and lite/thin but give good shock absorption.  Better than the ones I replaced these with.
5.0,Love the color and the ease to adjust fit.
5.0,My husband just opened both pair of sunglasses and is amazed at the quality and craftsmanship of them. The fact that they are so lightweight and have adjustable legs is another amazing feature! Thank you so much to Viable Harvest for this amazing item!
5.0,Product fits perfectly- Thanks Very Much!***
5.0,Beautiful and shiny. I love it!
5.0,Favorite bra ever
5.0,I own a few shirts off of the new whitewater line.  I love the hood on this ome for keeping you protected from the sun while having fun!  Great quality shirt.
5.0,"Bought this online so not sure how the umbrella really was.  But it's perfect!  Opens fast, hasn't been in the rain yet as we have 2 feet of snow but the fabric looks very sturdy.  My giraffe crazed daughter loves it!  Fast shipping even at the holidays.  No problems here."
5.0,This is a super cute dress on me! i love the way it hugs my curves! It is the perfect thickness- buying clothes online has been a new thing for me and I&#34;m always hesitant since I can't try it on/feel that the material isn't too thin. I can't wait to wear this!
5.0,"I love these sunglasses!! They are big, I mean really big. These are the biggest sunglasses I own! But I love shades that are big. I will agree with another reviewer, that these are the perfect shades for the day you don’t feel like doing your makeup, and that these will shade the face on those lazy days! Try them!!"
5.0,These have provided warmth while being thin and staying nicely under pants.
5.0,This belt is exceptionally nice. It is well worth the cost. I would have said the fit was just right but I’m not as big as I thought I was anyway this belt will still fit me if I gain more weight This is a very good buy.  I’m very happy with it.
5.0,Super cute look and the best price
5.0,"I am really very pleased with this purchase. Great price and what a great watch!! Very stylish and elegant, yet casual enough for everyday wear. Love this watch and I've received a lot of compliments on it."

5.0,"I love this burgundy handbag!!  Lots of room, nice inside organization and beautiful color!  It's as simple as that!!  Will be ordering more in other colors."
5.0,Love this hat !
5.0,"I bought this bag for a day at the amusement park but I will be using it for everything from now on! It fit everything I needed, including a 32 oz water bottle. The extra pockets help keep everything organized and easy to find. Comfortable to wear and I looove the pattern even more in person. Definitely my new go-to bag. Buy it, buy it, buy it!!"
5.0,Super cute and comfy. The sleeves were long enough- and I’m a long armed girl. Totally recommend. Right price. Looks cute with leggings!
5.0,"Thought the screws were to clamp it tighter but the actually make it looser if used.  Other than that, works as expected!"
5.0,Super cute! My granddaughter loved them! Great quality too.
5.0,"Soft, comfortable, and light weight. Unlike other no show socks, these feature some flattering color combinations and a handy set of grooves at the heel cup to keep them from rolling under your feet."
5.0,My daughter purchased these to wear.  Her current style ( something between Frank Gallagher and Euphoria ) make these a staple with every outfit. Lol
5.0,"Very glam & fun. I did trim it quite a bit in front, but I am fearless in that way! It gets tangled easier but still nice to have & a good color."
5.0,Comfortable stylish

5.0,The color is exactly as it shows! I LOVE this bracelet! Its not too big or too small... Worth it!
5.0,"5'3"", 128lbs. (15lbs of post baby weight still hanging on..sigh) I ordered size Small, and wasn't expecting a whole lot, but was pleasantly surprised. It didn't emphasize my tummy chub, thank goodness. This is a fun, modest, summer date dress."
5.0,"Great short, fits just like it should as a relaxed fit shirt. Love the color, never found this one in a store."
5.0,Cute costume for a fun event

5.0,Great joggers! The fabric is perfect for summer
5.0,Lovely top although must be warn with a tank top as it is thin and see through.
5.0,"I usually buy these sort of socks off of eBay from South Korea for cheaper price...for one. When these came up as a deal, I had to snatch it up! It's a good deal! And the socks last quite awhile...unless you have a habit of wearing the same one!"
5.0,"I purchased the sandals for my granddaughter who has been walking for two-three weeks.  She doesn't care to wear shoes and was able to remove the pair her mother purchased which just had a strap in the back.  The Lonsoen are perfect as they have the strap in back and they Velcro in front giving you the ability to tighten as needed.<br /><br />First thing my granddaughter did after I put them on was take a step and then sat down to take them off.  Wish I had the camera ready to capture the look when she realized the sandals weren't coming off.<br /><br />Her foot measured 5 1/4&quot; so I purchased size 6.  They are a smidgen big but her toes can breath and there's room to grow for the summer plus she is now walking in them with confidence.<br /><br />I am pleased with the quality, appearance and workmenship of this sandle so far."
5.0,Dress is very sexy and flattering.  It runs a little small but I love the color and style.

5.0,Theses are gifts to be given out in May.
5.0,Very satisfied soft an comfy
5.0,"a great way to be comfy without looking like a slob, upgrade your bath and body works cozy socks to these unless you're the kind of person who wears Christmas pajamas to Walmart then keep your B&BW cozy socks."
5.0,Great for persons who have a lot of small items to carry work or outings
5.0,This hat is so comfortable. I've tried others with a band inside and was worried it would be too tight. It is easy to mold into any shape and looks great. I absolutely love it!
5.0,Holds up in wash. No complaints and true to size.
5.0,Easter outfit
5.0,"Beautiful top. I'm plus size. It fit great. Has great stretch. I have big arms and it fit well. I recommend. Looks chic & professional. Can be worn to church, or work, or out with your man."

5.0,Love the mask. Not to thick.
5.0,The vest works perfect also works as back support.
5.0,"I am loving these sunglasses! I like that they are lightweight and do not squeeze my head. My head is large-ish and the hinges allow the arms to open a bit so they are not tight and fit just right. I appreciate that there are no separate nose pieces so I can slide these on top of my head without them getting tangled in my hair. The lens color is warm and kind of brown/red and they are polarized. They actually make colors appear more vivid. Style-wise they are pretty gender neutral, both hubby and I have worn them and really like them."
5.0,"Wow I am very impressed with this bra! Having started exercising 6x a week I was in need for more sports bras as the ones I have are starting to fall apart. I purchased some others through amazon but the quality and fit weren't perfect so I was a bit wary of getting yet another ill fitted bra. Upon receiving it I was pleasantly surprised. The appears of good quality, it's pretty and the color is just as the pictured.<br />They are amazing!"
5.0,Just what I wanted. Stylish and face is easy to read
5.0,"Awesome looking watch. Love the leather band, the face size is perfect. Very pleased with this purchase.!"
5.0,These are like a second skin on my feet!! I bought Gaim ones and the material over the toes are SO big and never stay in place. These are a perfect fit! LOVE!!
5.0,Been playing tennis my entire life and these are some of the very best sunglasses I have ever worn.<br /><br />The customer service from the company is also second to none.<br /><br />Great company and a great product - wish I saw that more often.
5.0,It it fit Im sure I would love it
5.0,Absolutely perfect shirt!
5.0,Muy buena calidad!!
5.0,Very comfortable and cute!

5.0,"It's a unicorn riding a T-rex, so it's perfect. Fits nicely, quality fabric, pocket is nice.  My new favorite apron."
5.0,Absolutely BEAUTIFUL Mala. High quality stones AND it’s hand knotted. Thank you for such a perfect gift.
5.0,I really like those; they are very soft and comfy but I haven't checked if they are water-proof yet; the fit is slightly off in the thighs but still the best ski/hiking pants that I've found
5.0,Great purse. Nice and big so I could fiit all my stuff in it and still be able to close it.
5.0,"Since no one ever does this, rendering their reviews useless...here are my stats and some pics.<br /><br />6'1&#34;<br />185lbs<br />Slim/Athletic build<br /><br />Fits great.<br /><br />Sorry for the sideways pics...no clue."
5.0,Item as expected.  Plastic so no need to worry about cutting something or someone!
5.0,Love this sleep set! It helps keep me cool at night while sleeping; which is normally a major problem. I would recommend them to anyone who sleeps hot. They are not restrictive and feel amazing.
5.0,Great quality and a great present!
5.0,This is more beautiful than I was expecting.  The pictures just don't do this ring justice at all.  It looks extremely real and the stones absolutely sparkle and shine like crazy!<br />The stones seems to be set in well and don't shake or move at all when I check them.  I ordered a size 9 and it runs true to size.<br />It comes in a nice gift box and would make a great promise or wedding ring for those on a budget.  I love wearing this and I get so so many compliments on it. It looks positively like genuine diamonds.  No one will know that this is CZ.  I am very pleased with my purchase.<br />I like to wear a set like this as opposed to my real wedding set.  I do a lot with my hands and this is holding up well.<br />I did receive a discount on this product for my honest and unbiased opinion.
5.0,These jeans fit really well
5.0,Great value for product.  My nana loves these shoes!

5.0,I love this outfit it’s very Sexy
5.0,"I am 5'2""  36DD  and I ordered a US XL=8 and it fit great. This size fit great and  color is good and has a nice style. Seems to be made out of quality material but wished it was 2mm thick.  We will see how well it holds up to diving."
5.0,Works like it's supposed too. Keeps the wear and tear down on the wheel. Also adds a little extra grip.
5.0,"I read the reviews before I purchased this shirt.  It runs extremely small so I ordered about six sizes bigger than I usually do. The shirt that I ordered fits perfect. It's a pretty good quality shirt, and you cannot beat that price! It's long enough for me to wear with leggings, which is what I was looking for. I also like the option of buttoning up the sides or leaving them down for more coverage. I would definitely buy this shirt again!"
5.0,This hat is great! Fit is comfortable and exactly what you’d expect from a new era 9twenty. I’ve been looking for a quality ucf hat since I’ve worn my old 47 brand one to pieces. I do wish that they would have used the same thread for the logo as they did for the new era logo on the side (ucf thread is a shiny gold rather than the more flat golden color for the new era logo). Other than that it fits the bill!
5.0,Love this dress. Im normally a 2x but went up a size im glad I did bc it gives me room to wear spanx and is not to tight around the stomach area. Very nice I love it and it got here really fast.
5.0,"I ordered 3 different snow boots to compare and this was the warmest, and best fitting of the 3 boots AFTER you have put them on. Their inner lining made it feel impossible that it was going to fit but after a little tugging and yanking i got my foot in. So there is a bit of struggle to get them on but they feel great once they are on.<br /><br />The other 2 I compared these to were<br />[[ASIN:B01GMU2R48 Mens Single Strap Waterproof Thermal Stable Snow Hiker Mucker Nylon Boot - Black - US13/EU46 - YC0424]]<br />[[ASIN:B00YUR9ED8 Mens Muck Nylon Strap Lace Up Duck Snow Winter Flat Rain Waterproof Boots - 12 - BLK45 YC0147]]"
5.0,I like it really well!
5.0,It's perfect material stretchy in all the right places
5.0,Great gift idea for my son who loves Supernatural!
5.0,"A really cool, delicate looking watch which makes a great gift for those who appreciate these things."
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE. Lots of compliments already. Fits just right! Would recommend this item and seller to anyone wanting a good quality choker. Very comfortable and cute. Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,Totally adorable.  My son asked for a robe for his 8th birthday and it is exactly what he wanted!
5.0,I will get more.
5.0,Received a defective product originally and the vendor replaced them for me.  Super cute earrings.
5.0,Loved the skull and bones.
5.0,Great product! Just what I expected. Good for the price.
5.0,"I couldn't find pants I liked. So I looked in my closet, took my favorites out, shopped on Amazon for the label and the size and Voila! My new favorite pair."
5.0,I am diabetic and have to wear slippers a lot.  Thesearevery comfortable. I can sleep in them if I want.
5.0,Good quality Thanks
5.0,They keep my hands very warm and they're quite stylish. Not too bulky. The touch screen tips aren't tight enough on my fingers so they dont always work but that could also because i have short fingers.
5.0,Great for events. Good quality.
5.0,"I have probably ordered at least 25 “V-Neck Tees” from Amazon over the years.  60% of the time they have arrived and there is always an additional fabric in the shirt that was not in the description of the shirt.  I like 100% cotton tees. For me they fit better,  look better and handles well when laundering. I always hang dry 100% cotton items. I retired early and so my wardrobe consists mainly of casual clothes.  I wear a lot of athleisure clothing.<br />When this Tee Shirt arrived and i opened the package and felt the fabric I was so excited. 100% cotton but its not your ordinary tee. It is nice enough to wear with jeans, shorts, casual pants and of course athletic and yoga pants. I tried it on immediately and the fit was perfect and @$9.99 the price was right too!  I like my tees a little oversized plus I account for some shrinkage (even though I hang dry) so I ordered a Xxl. It was a perfect fit, a little loose but not so it makes you look frumpy. I’m  5’10 and usually wear a 12/14.<br />I love this tee shirt so much I immediately ordered 3 other colors I like.  Actually, one came today after ordering it late yesterday afternoon. Thank you Amazon for sending a shirt that not only matched the description but looks great and feels great.<br />**The only thing I question is why some of the colors are a different price?  There are some that were $9.99 and others (that were listed below in different colors, looked like the exact same shirt that were $14.99, 17.99). I would love to order some of those colors but I don’t understand why the same shirt/different color would be more $.<br />Bottom line….I love this VNeck tee and would recommend to anyone who likes nice casual comfortable tees."
5.0,"I like everything about this item from the price ($30 below the same item in a catalog) to overnight delivery, to function as described, I am ordering another one for my wife."
5.0,Just as described. Super cute on. Love the ease of a one piece.
5.0,"Happy with this glasses. Love it for a most important reason which is its light weight. As it’s so light and snug, I can wear it for a whole day without feeling tired. Definitely a must-have for people running outside in sunny days. Plus it can protect my eyes and make me feel comfortable seeing things in sunshine."
5.0,"My little guy is 2 3/4 and slightly larger than average.  We usually get 3Ts for him which always fit or are maybe a tad big.  For this set, he definitely needs the toddler 4 size.  But I highly recommend it.  The material is very high quality and the design is stitched on.  These are so cute for summer nights!"
5.0,"Gold heart and chain were a perfect match. The size of the heart pendant was perfect for my daughter who is a little older.  The others I saw were way to tiny, puffed, and better suited for a young child, or charm bracelet."
5.0,I did not get the color I asked for ... I got a neon yellow instead was disappointed
5.0,"They will be given as Christmas Presents!!! I'm sure they will Love them!!<br /><br />Thank you, God Bless"
5.0,Pretty winter bat
5.0,Their tops are great quality and fit true to size. I have ordered multiple items from this brand.
5.0,I wear them as soon as i get out of the shower till i go to bed. and its nice not having to worry about finding a pair of socks that match...LOL
5.0,"When these first came out I bought them in both Blue and Green.  I never had seen that they had one in Yellow, so I had to grab this one! Can't wait to sport this one this summer!"
5.0,"I love this product it is big enough to carry everything I need , lots of room and plenty of pockets to keep everything organized great price, great product and I would definitely use this seller again quick delivery"
5.0,"I love it so much I bought a black and a white one. This is my new favorite dress! Be careful wear you sit though. I sat in an Adirondack, and some of the little balls at the bottom pulled off. But the dress is precious!"
5.0,"I'm a huge fan of the Uncharted games. I wanted this ring for a long time and finally ordered it. It looks great, and I have been wearing it off and on since receiving it. My only gripe is the leather cord is too long and it seems like it might break at some point. I fixed the length issue by tying another knit in it, now it's the correct length, and as for it breaking, I can wear the ring and I'm sure I could find a replacement for next to nothing. I recommend this ring to any fellow Nathan Drake wannabe. :)"
5.0,Just what we were looking for all good
5.0,"Great set of shades for bicycling. The frames are very lightweight & comfortable, with a fully customizable nose rest. Four different sets of lenses are included allowing you to choose the set that best fits the lighting condition of any given day or night.<br /><br />A nice storage case is included with individual spaces for each lense, a microfiber cloth, bag, and a pair of straps. The zippered case includes a hook which can be used for storage or for securing the case to a bike.<br /><br />Only thing missing is Printed Directions explaining how to change the lenses - easy enough to figure out, but if you have difficulty, you'll need to refer to the item description.<br /><br />There is a set of hollow, lense-less frames as well. These rest between your eyes and the actual set of lenses you choose . I'm not sure what the purpose of them is, but they were rather annoying and hindered the line of sight so I removed them."
5.0,Super great product.  Doesn't fall out and sturdy in design. Really happy and would order again.
5.0,"Very small, easy to insert. They do move around inside the nostril and sometimes stick out a little."
5.0,Looks and feels good. Collar is not very stretchable but overall nice graphics
5.0,My husband loves these!
5.0,This is a good product I always wanted one of these championships it cool For a minute when it went to Chicago I was worried but it was good it came with ups and Good championship
5.0,"I read a many reviews before I purchased. Many of them advocated buying a size up. I am 5'5&#34; and 120 lbs and decided to go ahead and order the Medium based on one review that said the only difference was in if you wanted a tee shirt fit versus a more roomy fit. The tee shirt fit sounded good to me. The Medium has PLENTY of room, more than necessary. Just be honest about your size and go with that. No reason to size up as far as I can see. I think a Small would've been just fine for me. BTW,  they are incredibly comfortable and make me feel amazing!"
5.0,I'm really happy with this one!
5.0,beautiful;
5.0,Love Patty Boutik
5.0,Gift for my daughter and she loves them!
5.0,Great fabric fits will.
5.0,Fits well !
5.0,The robe is super soft but the size seems more like an 8-10 to be honest.  It hangs off my daughter.  But she loves it<br />Regardless
5.0,Love the image on the mask. Material is thick but comfortable.
5.0,Granddaughter gift.
5.0,very good and dos what et say no problem with the driving glasses
5.0,It’s great buy .
5.0,Great fit my favorite part is the mobile pocket. Very comfortable
5.0,I liked the one carat pendant.  Two carats might have been overkill.  The color is DF and sparkly but not rainbow like some Moissanite can be.  It would be great if one could choose a necklace size. I like the  bale  because the pendant does not sip around on the necklace.<br />I am very pleased with this purchace.
5.0,Fantastic value.
5.0,"Surprisingly efficient for the price,  kept us warm in the ocean and was pretty easy to put on and off as well as to clean. Made it swimming in the water a lot more fun!"
5.0,"Very Very nice,Will buy more colors in the future,and it arrived on time."
5.0,Served many years in one of America's best...pride in wear it then and proud wearing the symbol of it thru Amazon... Thank You

5.0,See-through and light weight. They are a perfect length.
5.0,Beautiful shirt!  Nice quality!
5.0,Love this! I am always an xs/s in tops and I would say this ran try to size.
5.0,The quality is absolutely great. Loved the piece.
5.0,"Really, really cute fun earrings. Gonna buy other colors if availa le"
5.0,Exactly as it looks! Bright powder blue for baby boy shower gift! it is nautical themed so the anchor fit in with other decor. The infinity symbol for loving our love forever! It is a beautiful bracelet just to buy for a summertime look!
5.0,"The necklace is heavier than expected, quality way exceed the price!"
5.0,"Love these skirts!!! Very stretchy- Smooth jersey knit- like.  Easy wash and wear. Light weight. Perfect modest length. A must have in a girl's closet. Got in Black, burgundy, gray, and Royal blue. My only complaint is that the blue seams to be about 3&#34; shorter than my other colors. Hmmmm...  still nice length but definitely shorter than my others (same seller/ style/ etc  just different color) so falls right at knee or slightly above when rides up. (I am 5' 4.5&#34; for your reference & 155 lbs curvy figure)  RECOMMEND. :)"
5.0,All I wanted at a very low price. Hope to buy from them again soon!
5.0,"Nice fit and length ,light wight for summer wear . Very satisfied, good price"
5.0,Shoes are cute I normally wear a 6 in youth and Glad I  got the 6.5 very happy and the price was perfect
5.0,Good price. Just what I was looking for. The sizing was correct.
5.0,I absolutely love the purse. Not to large perfect
5.0,"The material is very nice, and all the other ladies I have shown this to love them also, though I could have used one size smaller than what was suggested to me."
5.0,"when I opened the packaging and brought out the bead and saw the two little white bears on the blue bead - I smiled a large smile. Very very cute. I plan to group this into my seasonal ""winter"" beads."
5.0,Another great safety vest from Safety Depot - very impressed!
5.0,the one I ordered is a bit different than this photo<br />But I liked it
5.0,Perfect! Got this set for a  masquerade  Birthday party for guest and they were a hit!
5.0,My daughter loves her necklace great choice
5.0,This mask runs large which is actually what I like about it.  My husband has a hard time getting a mask to fit properly.  Even adult ones seem to look uncomfortable on him.  This fits nicely and doesn't look stretched across his face.
5.0,Great quality. Worked out great.
5.0,I get numerous compliments a day!
5.0,I love this cover up.  It's been years since I've been im a bathing suit or on a beach.  I was clueless about cover ups.  I usually wear shorts or just a long tshirt.  I live this! Stylish and does it's job.
5.0,Beautiful.. nice length
5.0,"Exactly as expected!  With a new strap, it made my old watch new again."
5.0,"Item shipped fast and was intact. Quality is of a thick enough metal for durability, but still light enough for a child to use. Good purchase."
5.0,I love this bathing suit. It’s a perfect fit and definitely true to size. The zipdown front gives it a sexy edge.
5.0,"It seems a good quality, size is normal and the leather is good"
5.0,This bracelet is very nice and looks like the photo or even better.  I bought this as a gift for a man.  The size should be perfect for him at 7.5&#34;  Some bracelets are too large but this should be perfect!  I'm very happy with it.
5.0,Beautiful flows dress. I wore to my nephews baptism and got many compliments. If it’s windy be careful with this dress.... it flies and you may flash a bystander. It’s super lightweight and comfortable. It is a bit short in front .. so if you have longer legs order side up. I am 5”0/106lb/34B and oredered a small.
5.0,I love this bag. It's very cute and can hold most of my cards.
5.0,good quality readers
5.0,She loves it but it is a little bigger than she would like.  She wants to keep it so and says she will grow into it.
5.0,Beautiful piece.  Only Mode 3 keeps my Seikos wound.
5.0,son loved socks. thinner material then expected but overall a nice item.
5.0,Fun deal! Pretty stones and it is novel to have so many options to match with my outfits :D
5.0,Nice vivid colors and the scarf has a nice weight to it.
5.0,I purchased this bracelet as a gift and they loved it!  It's very good looking and was a perfect fit for their small wrist.. I would definitely order from this vendor again because they have the smaller sizes which are so hard to find.
5.0,I like it it definitely feels like it will help
5.0,These plugs are super cool. Every time I wear them out I get a lot of compliments. The resin filled plugs add some weight to help with your lobes as well. All in all I love these.
5.0,"I wear the socks around the house all of the time.  They keep my feet warm without wearing slippers.  As I do not need at the moment for the foot pads that came as a gift, I put them on the side in case I need them one day. Thank you so much for your great customer service!!"
5.0,Love it. Gives when you bend over and stays sung when you stand up.<br />You should look into getting a metal bucket if used for dress Suits.
5.0,I get compliments on these all the time.
5.0,So everyone talked about how you must size up because it runs small. In this case it wasn’t true to my body. Im 5’3 and weigh 185 lbs. I usually wear a large so i bought the one that says xxxl/xl and it fit loosely. I have a large bust and i usually need something tighter for that area. I also have large thighs but that area wasnt tight either. So next time ill purchase the size I usually wear. The product is great the material is very comfortable too.
5.0,"great bows, thank you!"
5.0,"Fits perfect, made well, fast shipping."
5.0,I bought this set for my grandson and guess what - this was exactly what he wanted for Christmas!!!  Service and Quality are excellent!
5.0,"Great fit that stays on!  Beautiful fabric, soft and full, not flimsy."
5.0,Nice deal - quality's not bad for price anyway
5.0,I have had this wallet for a while now and I still love it. It gets a fair share of complements aswell.
5.0,"I use this is a purse/mini diaper bag. I can fit a bottle, bib, food, toy, wallet, phone, and more! It has a lot of zippers, which is perfect for not losing things. Plenty of places to put different types of items. The strap is very adjustable. The color is also very nice."
5.0,The quality is amazing and the stitching is clean. Highly recommended.
5.0,It working thus far..
5.0,I really like the fit.
5.0,Pants are exact as expected. I am 120 lbs and medium fits perfect so they run small. Material is lightweight so for winter wear leggings underneath. Love them.
5.0,Nice heavyweight hoodie. Seems well made.
5.0,"It arrived quicker than I expected. Lovely piece, not heavy as one would expect."
5.0,Love the coverage.  Not too big and not too small coverage.  Just right.

5.0,Good product quality good
5.0,I love the fit and do comfortable!!!! The progressive lens are very good quality!
5.0,"Love this bangle! It fits just right with a snap enclosure of metal, and it comes in lovely different colors!"
5.0,"Soooo cute! They fit perfectly!  And they look just like the picture! I normally don't expect the items I buy to look just like the display picture, companies usually try and make things look better in the picture that what they truly are but these socks are just like the picture! They are so comfortable!  I didn't expect them to be this nice and soft! A great buy!"
5.0,"Fits perfect, the colors right and its comfy to wear"
5.0,Regal!
5.0,I love the high waistline and the pockets.
5.0,The hat is perfect! fits just right and goes with much of my wardrobe.
5.0,Very comfortable.  My wife also really likes them-
5.0,Can’t  say how perfect they fit me and you actually forget your wearing a bra.
5.0,Awesomr
5.0,"I am 5'6&#34; and 153lbs and I usually fit in a size 6 dress. Based on other people's reviews, I ordered a Medium and it fit perfectly. It wasn't short on me and it hid my imperfections. Although since I am pretty busty. The V was more deep than I expected and will probably require me to wear either a bandeau bra or a bralette. Either way it looks great and super comfy! The material was surprisingly sturdy and I could tell will survive multiple washings."
5.0,Well made.  Nice fabric.  It is low cut.  If you don't wish to show too much cleveage you can wear a cami underneath.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,If you are trying to decide whether or not to get these sunglasses just do it you will not regret it! They are amazing! Not only are they stylish but they are also very well made!!
5.0,First pair of compression socks that fit and I could wear all day without any problems.
5.0,It really its beautiful and the material is nice
5.0,Chain hang low
5.0,"Great product, i had to tuck the ears were a little big, but ive gotten alot of compliments at work during the holidays"
5.0,"This bra fits as expected, the pads in it were funky like all sports bras and it rolls up a lot in the band. It got me through a few workouts, but my boobs were still all over the place. Fabric is pretty sturdy, it’s just not for bigger breasts."
5.0,Awesome price!
5.0,"LOVE these Beenies, they fit great, always get compliments on them"
5.0,Color looks even better in person.
5.0,These are so well made and a great size with out being too big or too small. We bough for them for our 6 month old and will be buying a second pack because she is now a year and has enough hair for two pony tails or side clips
5.0,Bought the dress for a Beautiful Exquisite Lady. In her own words(Fit really well and the length was good too. It wasn't short or tight it fit just right.)
5.0,I just got it and wore it I'm a fit guy so often my arms don't fit in these shirts but the quality stitching and design of this shirt fits just as great as my custom made shirts. I love it!
5.0,Lovely Jubbly... The bag arrived as scheduled.  It was a bit larger than what I expected but  perfect for my needs. Thanks Ever SoOo Much!
5.0,"Love these joggers! Super comfortable, a cotton fabric feel with a nice amount of stretch, and very well made. Love the drawstring waistband and that it doesn’t cut into my stomach, or create a bulge above the waistline. Plan to wear these to lounge in, but will also throw a cardigan or jacket on with them to run errands."
5.0,"I bought one of these watches to help me keep time without having to drag out my cell phone all hours of the day. It is cheap and has basic time keeping, stopwatch, and alarm functionality. It has performed admirably for the year I've used it, even surviving a summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, where it was caked in 1/8"" of ice (pics here: [...]). My only complaints are that it has no hour hand in stopwatch mode, and you can't use the backlight to view your stopwatch time, as it resets the stopwatch.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Easy to use<br />Drab appearance<br />Durable(water/ice/etc)<br /><br />Cons:<br />No hours on stopwatch<br />Backlight button resets stopwatch<br />UI is somewhat un-intuitive"
5.0,I bought the blue pattern one and it's very nice. Deep colors and perfect fit. Lots of compliments and most important is that it gives you some coverage on the back side while slimming you down
5.0,This is a lushly hued scarf that feels like a dream. Now one of my favorites.
5.0,Absolutely beautiful dress very flattering slim fitting dress even for a thick woman. with a spanx under to smooth everything I felt beautiful and elegant. I wear a size 18 and purchased xxl.<br />The lil train does pick up everything when outside and got frayed a bit from hitting the ground but it does not stop me from wanting it in another color for a future wedding.
5.0,Love this hat. Makes it easy to have a ponytail and hat without one one or other conflicting.
5.0,"Great design, good quality fabric, fits very well"
5.0,Love this watch. Very comfortable to wear. Good value for money.
5.0,"Good quality and very attractive print. Happy with my purchase and would buy again. The tag said 100% silk, I have no reason to doubt it."
5.0,I bought this as a Halloween outfit for Spinelli but wanted something I could wear after the fact. I would recommend this if that's how you live your life. I simply love this dress. It's very lightweight but has enough drape to it that it's flattering. I would definitely buy more colors if I wanted to.
5.0,My wife thinks that they are good quality typical of Peavey.
5.0,"Love this case.  It is absolutely beautiful.  It does offer some protection, but I would recommend it mainly for adults as I feel it does not offer a huge amount of protection that teens or younger kids might need for their phones.  I love that it lets your phone been seen and yet enhances the phone with the picture of the flowers.  Elegant, but not flashy.  I have gotten many compliments on this case.  It does provide protection from scratches on the phone itself and the slim fit of the case allows it to fit in an arm band and/or a waterproof case so you don't have to remove the case when using these for sports or events.  Overall great case for adults!!"
5.0,❤️ Love
5.0,"It's works just as expected.  I'm planning to use the buckle between this and a brown belt as well, but havent made the swap yet."
5.0,Great. They loved the gift.
5.0,"The anchors a little bit smaller then what the picture shows, but I still love this bracelet. It's durable and looks good"
5.0,Cute shoes - especially the “leather” back to the black pair 😍
5.0,Small and sweet.
5.0,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!
5.0,Used for Jordans works great!
5.0,I love my necklace!! I get sooo many compliments on it! The natural wood is still beautiful after many trekking trips and showers!! Lol
5.0,Fits a little large but should be fine after the first wash.<br />Great design and a great tag team faction.
5.0,"I really liked this nightgown although, it came apart at the strap, now, I cannot wear it I would like another one"
5.0,"I am completely satisfied with these clip on flip ups.  They are sassy light weight, and most of all the polarization is perfect.  Great product ."
5.0,Great out fit he loved it and he got so many compliments
5.0,"Here are my wife's comments. She really liked these sandals and gives a five-star rating.<br /><br />""I looked at these and thought they would be heavy. I was very surprised that they are extremely lightweight and not fatiguing at all. But there are some really good things beside this.<br /><br />""For one thing they look nice. In their own way they are stylish and attractive. They are actually wearable for lunches and things, not just going to the beach or exercise.<br /><br />""They also have height. I am on the shorter side and the height of the shoe really helps.<br /><br />""They are very comfortable and the fit is true. I have narrow feet and they still work for me.<br /><br />""So --- very good. Five stars."""
5.0,I'm so happy with my purchase. Beautiful color as shown. Straw parts makes summery and those tassels are good quality (not like those skinny sad ones). Must buy items for summer!
5.0,"This is a GREAT dress - I am usually a small in most clothing (USA sizing) and ordered the small for this - I like the slightly baggier look, and it &#34;hangs&#34; nicely, but, I could have ordered a size down and been fine as well.  I orders several in different colors.  They are similar to the more expensive Kuza brand, but the fabric on these actually seems to be a higher quality fabric.  I would strongly recommend : )"
5.0,"I love this Henley! Very confortable and fits as expected.<br />Hope they will make them in other colors, otherwise I will have to buy another one in green!"
5.0,This is a beautiful and quality piece of jewelry. I have been wearing it for four months and it looks as good as the day I received it. A great find!
5.0,"I'm pretty impressed with these leggings.<br />The XL fits a tad loose on my medium calves, but great on the butt and thighs (6' 200lbs 33&#34;waist). Nice and long with a low waist.<br />Thank goodness the print is sewn evenly on both legs- something that is hit or miss with these vendors.<br />I've machine washed and hung to dry and they're holding up fine. Usually the stitching in the crotch is the first thing to go with these.<br />I've ordered 2 more with different designs- I'll update if things change.<br />2 week shipping from China- delivered by USPS."
5.0,Got these for my nephew and they looked so cute on him!!
5.0,Looks and fits as expected.
5.0,Great size. The pockets and zipper pouches allow for all that is needed. The adjustable shoulder strap makes for perfect fit.  The color is stunning.
5.0,Nice shirt to work in the sun
5.0,Great shades but come loose at hinges too quickly
5.0,"I keep buying these. I use mine daily for 8 hours or more, and one i have will last an entire 12-hour shift."
5.0,It's a nice bag and larger than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for pieces and other sundry items. Feels like it should last a good while.
5.0,"I bought this dress to have options for attending the theatre and cocktail hours. I LOVE. THIS. DRESS. I'm short (4'11) and curvy and this dress fits me perfect in every way. The black top hides just enough, and the long skirt hits me mid-calf (my preference to ""too short"" dresses).  I want to buy other colors to have more options, but I don't love any of the other designs as much as I love the one I bought. Can't wait to wear it out more."
5.0,"This is my second pair of these.  The shade is perfect for driving....not too dark, not to light.  And they look great as well.  Would certainly order again."
5.0,Super easy to install. I used my earring to push out on the side. Rose gold matched perfectly with my Fossil smart watch.
5.0,Love this dress! Only complaint is that it is a little long for me bc I’m 5’4”. It is really beautiful though!
5.0,Love the way they fit. Perfect for every outfit I weat
5.0,Just the little hook to hold each brace it comes out on it's own other than that it's perfect matching for my watch also to work out with.
5.0,Love these they are adorable!!!!!
5.0,Now that the weather has turned cold these are my favorite nightgowns.  They fit a little smug but loving them still!
5.0,I love these shoes!!  They are super cute.  The picture is so lousy that I almost decided not to get them.  Because the price point was so low I decided to take a chance and I'm very happy I did.  I actually took a leap of faith and got them in brown too...thank goodness!!<br /><br />If I could say anything to the seller it would be to upgrade the picture.  You will sell more!!
5.0,Purchased to store summer shoes. The bags are well made. 5 stars.
5.0,Heavy duty item. Very quality. Larger than I expected but still a good quality item. The ring on the front unscrews and can be removed. I didn't expect that or see that on any reviews.

5.0,it looks really nice I'm glad I bought it I'm loving it thank you.
5.0,"Five stars, I was expecting something very unpleasant to wear for the price I paid but it turned out great. The pants however weren't made with me in mind but I don't blame the maker for such since they didn't know my body size, it's not an issue anyways since I have black pants anyways. The top button popped off rather easily, it's nothing a needle and thread couldn't fix so I won't deduct from the over all score of the product for it"
5.0,JUST AS ADVERTIZED
5.0,Great fit and no scratches
5.0,"Masks fit very well and are a great second layer to surgical masks. Since double-masking is becoming the new standard for protection, the earsaver that was enclosed makes wearing the product SUPER comfortable and practical."

5.0,perfect for the evening wear
5.0,"When I got it in, it was so wrinkled. I took a steamer to it and it was perfect. I wore nude under garments so no worries there with it being see though.  The length is perfect. Little thin material. Got so many compliments on the dress."
5.0,LOVE this dress. It's super flowy and cute. Perfect for just throwing something on but still looking like you made an effort.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:bddac8455110d79eb9af10d82cbc461a]] Such great quality and very soft!! It’s so comfortable and u can wear it anywhere. Running errands, lounging around the house, or to bed!! I want to get more colors"

5.0,Loved this dress! It fit perfectly and was better material than what I was expecting. The white seems kind of a more offish white to me but still beautiful.
5.0,Loved the purse my son gave it to me for Christmas. But very disappointed that the hand is coming apart. Only used it fir a short while. Would love to replace it but it’s past the exchange time. For the amount of money he spent on this gift and the brand it should have lasted longer.
5.0,Great dress.  I have 2 colors
5.0,"I purchased this item for my  10k run. The day was to start out a little chilly, and this was a jacket that was perfect before, during and post run. Never felt constricted, felt comfortable during the entire time. Very satisfied with this purchase. Will buy again. I PR'd!"
5.0,"Looks good. Holds shape. Good for sailing, looks like I own the boat (which I don't)."
5.0,Very durable....I really like it.
5.0,Nike as a brand runs small. So as long as you size up they are great.
5.0,"These were for my college-age daughter.  She wears one almost every day.  They have stood up well, and still look good, months later.  They are nice casual belts, a good value for the price."
5.0,"Beautiful, love them"
5.0,Super cute and surprisingly big!!

5.0,SUPER CUTE!! Came faster then anticipated! Fits perfect! Will be ordering more!
5.0,Like the colors in the shirt.
5.0,"This necklace is very striking.  The white beads are very white and I love how they gradually lead into the coral beads.  I thought I would be happier with an entire coral necklace - but I love this necklace.  Great quality, arrived very professionally packaged.  The necklace is made extremely well and is beautiful on."
5.0,Love the gloves. For the up coming weather.
5.0,I purchased these tragus earrings when searching for shorter posts for my two-year-old cartilage piercings. I love the color and the five different shapes they come in. The quality is pretty good and I am very happy I purchased them. I would like to purchase more of these in the different available colors. I recommend these to people who want to add a little bling to their piercings.
5.0,I ordered these thinking that they would at least look the part for everyday wear.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the necklace; especially considering the price.  The strand is heavy and settles nicely around my neck.  I got a lot more than I had hoped!
5.0,I originally was looking for nipple rings when I ran across these and decided these septum ring hoops would be perfect for the nipple piercing. I ended up ordering the pack of three and receiving them in the mail within the time they were due to arrive. I checked the package as well as the rings for any type of damage. There were no noticeable damage at all. When I exchanged the current hoops I had in to these ones they were a perfect fit. I liked this better due to the constant grabbing of the hoops on items I was wearing. These hoops laid flat against the skin and did not cause me any harm at all. They were very easy to put on and the screw mechanism was easy to use. They did not snag clothing or anything else.<br />I received these septum hoops for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion.
5.0,Great outfit
5.0,I bought these because I have to stand outside for about 1 hour every morning and afternoon to get my grandkids on and off their buses (3 kids- 3 buses- 3 different times)  I wear them under jeans or leggings with no problems. Very warm and cozy.  Wash well I haven't put them in the dryer so I can't say how well they would dry.  I hang dry and they come out very nice.
5.0,These are great non-slip socks! I already reordered more.
5.0,"This has the look and feel of a high-end wallet, with medium-firm leather and nice outer stitching.  It is slim and feels comfortable in my back pocket.  The smooth black leather has a premium finish to it.  It has left and right pockets for stuff, and four card slots on each side.  It looks and feels like it should last a long time.  This is really nice wallet."
5.0,"I was surprised, I like it. So much"
5.0,I got so many compliments on these! they are a pumpkin neon orange. extremely lightweight and perfect fit. It was a little confusing to figure out how to put the backing on but it all ended up working out! I really loved this product! 10/10
5.0,"These fit perfectly. I consulted their size chart (not Amazon's generic one).<br />Love the deep pockets. This was the main reason I want these.<br />The only complaint is it seems like as they increased the size they increased the length too much. I may have someone shorten these for me. The pictures show right at the knee, mine are well below it. Almost crop pants."
5.0,Thank you so much...the brand one is ridiculously overpriced
5.0,Cute product and fit my five year old.
5.0,"Beautiful and very flattering.  The orange is bright and better in person than the picture.  I am 4'11, 130 and got a small."
5.0,Amazing quality! I am 5 foot 8 in tall and the medium fit me perfectly. The color and design we're just as vibrant as shown in the picture. But just like everyone else says it is slightly see-through so make sure you are aware of that
5.0,Second one I bought.  Holds everything you need for the beach or grocery shopping/ totally waterproof and will last a lifetime/ bought this one for my daughter in law.  They have a boat and having a second child.  It will come in handy.  So much better than canvas.  Great quality and size.
5.0,Gave as a retirement gift and she loved it.
5.0,I got these for my mom as her doctor recommended these as she stands all day at work. My mom liked these so much she ordered another pair.

5.0,This is just perfect for those not too cold days and can wear casual or with dress clothes. Perfect for any occasion.
5.0,I love it. I have a petite size lefty body. This piece made me look like I have a longer body.<br />Great material and great stitching. Very comfortable and beautiful at the same time.
5.0,A very comfy top.  I wish they had more colors.
5.0,sizing is accurate
5.0,"Sexxxy very nice, soft bu t.c I bought it for my Wife...its packaging...she's the package 😉"

5.0,"Very thick, fits well"
5.0,"These are beautiful! I was worried they'd be too bulky or gaudy looking, but they're perfect. Surprisingly lightweight and don't irritate my sensitive ears/skin. They're the perfect statement piece without being over the top."
5.0,There really nice and warm. They feel like they might be a little small but there not as soon as you get ur hand in them litterly fit like a glove. Kinda fancy.
5.0,Very flattering.  Material hugs in the right places making for a great hourglass shape
5.0,"I am 137lbs 5'3"", w/a 34D chest, 29 waist and 38 hips. I bought a medium and it fits perfect. It does not pull nor is too tight across the chest. If anything, there is a slight gaping at the armpits, but when layered over a shirt it is not an issue. I am just happy it is not rubbing painfully under arms once straps have been shortened. I can sew and if it really bothered me and i was super picky I could take in it in 1""x1"" each side to fix, so again, not a big gap AT ALL) I love the adjustable straps so that no cleavage shows, and the skirt falls just above my knee for a modest length. Not snug or tight across the bottom either. Material is soft and stretchy- LOVE this dress!!"
5.0,"I absolutely love this sweater. It is light weight and perfect for the Spring. I also have a brown one, which I ordered a few weeks before this one that I love also."
5.0,It’s the best necklace ever! Love the tri tone and feel if it. It could pick clothes so don’t wear delicate fabric

5.0,I bought this bag to give as a gift and the recipient loved it.

5.0,Perfit fit and stylish too!
5.0,"Not fancy, but does do what it is supposed to do. Embroidery is good. Thx"

5.0,"This is a maxi dress that is very comfortable.  It has nice deep pockets on each side of the dress.  Overall, it's a very comfortable dress."
5.0,"Bought this in Roseville gold and it's so gorgeous!!  The baguette stones really sparkle!  I've been wearing it 3-4 times a week for about three months that and no signs of discoloration yet, which worried me at this price point.  I've gotten so many compliments on this that I ended up buying two more to give as gifts."
5.0,5&#34;7 198 lbs (8 weeks postpartum) this dress made me look and feel  even though Im still packing a few extra pounds since pregnancy. Would buy from this company again!

5.0,"Everyone that has seen it, loves it"
5.0,"Update 9/12/16: Christina from TRUMiRR reach out to me regarding my review. They offered to send me a replacement free of charge. I've never had such great service from anyone I've bought from in the past.  I updated to a five a star based on follow up service. Thanks Christina!<br /><br />I like the band. It's got a good quality feel. Problem is, only half of it fits. One end is apparently larger than the other, and won't fit into my watch. Disappointing. Maybe I can shave it down"
5.0,"I simply  adore this coat,  the color  is perfect  brown  faux fur. Length  is right at knee. Snap closure with  design  button at top which  does not button  or snap. Can  hardly  wait  for cooler  weather to wear."
5.0,"These are cute, sparkly, bright, and fun for Halloween (I will wear them often through October)!"
5.0,"My dad loves it. His Cubs won it all, so, getting a championship hat for him was a must, and this was an excellent choice! Must have for any Cubs fan because THE DROUGHT IS OVER"
5.0,I recently started biking and it's hard to find good biking clothes at reasonable price that can last. I'm quite happy with this shirt so far. Washes well and it's comfortable for the ride.
5.0,"Very surprising to read some of these reviews!  It fits me perfectly (34B) which is what I am in nearly all brands.  The front clasp is so simple, easy to open and close, and doesn't feel like it will break.  Extremely comfortable bra, I totally don't mind wearing a bra when I'm wearing this one.  Changing my collection to make this my everyday bra!"
5.0,I love these. I can't afford actual ray bans so this is a great alternative for the people on a budget. Awesome!
5.0,"Light and airy, fast shipping"
5.0,"Really nice dress for price! I’m 5’6, 180 pounds, 36 C & I got size large! Perfect length. Texture is different than what I thought but still stretchy and comfortable."
5.0,These shirts came exactly as described and the little girl loved them.

5.0,Love it! Going to wear it when I'm on my SUP board!
5.0,beautiful hat
5.0,Great shoes! Love them. This is my 2nd pair. They don't have 8.5-9 size though. Had to wait.
5.0,Nice bag for toiletries.  Works great for my husbands items and will be great on trips.  Good price.
5.0,Liked goes around neck
5.0,"I wore this dress to a wedding. It was very stretchy and comfortable. I found that it did rise a bit as I was moving, walking and sitting, and had to pull it down more than I would have liked. Im 5'2 and 180lbs and considered myself to be on the smaller curvy side. The dress hugged my curves and and was very flattering. Easy to put on and zips in the back. The neckline was very different and I loved the fact that the dress was more full coverage up top. Not sure If I busted the seems or if the zipper was never connected at the bottom in the back but there was a small hole there that I had to sew. I got lots of compliments and loved the fit. If  you don't want it as snug, I would size up and size down for a tighter fit. I normally wear mediums."
5.0,This bag is very large.  I love it.  Very well made.
5.0,Love this wallet with money clip and hold lots of credit cards.
5.0,All very nicely presented
5.0,Sooooo comfy! Love them!
5.0,"Best Fitting, Best Colorful, Best Warmth, Best Sweatshirt I own. It's a look perfect look no matter what time of year. A classic."
5.0,LOVE THE COLOR AND SIZE CHOICES.
5.0,"I'm 5'7 and abt 125 lbs, I ordered a large and it fits properly...not small but definitely not big. The sweatshirt is lightweight and nicely made. I would suggest ordering a larger size because I think it would have been small if I ordered my correct size."
5.0,Bought it for my work but ended up wearing it to a military honoring ceremony and got nothing but compliments for it.
5.0,"Gorgeous, the stones used are very sparkly and it hangs at the perfect length (I'm fairly average in size, 5' 3&#34; and size 6-8 in clothes). I used them for my wedding and could not have been more happy with them. I will say the earrings might twist and lay funny, but being dangling studs (or whatever they're called) that's to be expected and I never had that problem (though I've had that with other earrings of mine)."
5.0,Fits right in. I hope I do not need to buy again but if I do I'll get it from Panatime!
5.0,"Exactly as advertised. It is polyester, which the description says. We bought it as a costume, so I don't think my daughter would wear it as an actual dress."
5.0,Fixed issue quickly and sent wonderful new product!  5 stars!
5.0,Well it did what it is supposed to do. provided relief from cold. Material is soft and comfortable.
5.0,"This is a Lama jacket! This is my second item from this manufacturer and I love how thick and warm this alpaca jacket is. Made great, soft, and a true Lama Jacket worthy of a flea market in Illinois. So very pleased a great fall spring jacket."
5.0,"Definitely not made with petite girls in mind, but it’s very comfortable and the material is so soft!"
5.0,These earrings are boutique quality and far more reasonable
5.0,Fit great. Look great. Durable. Love em.
5.0,"I saw this dress on Pinterest, from a well known clothing brand, for more that triple the cost. Did a quick search on Amazon using specific descriptions for this dress and I got an exact hit. Fits pretty true to size. A little too revealing for my comfort level, so I prefer to wear a lace bra or tank under it. Shipped faster than expected."
5.0,Exceeded my expectations for the price it cost me . I was very impressed. Looked very well on my son . He likes the thin tie look . Thanks
5.0,"Out of all the t shirt style dresses, the Korsis brand along with Coreal T shirt dresses are the best fitting dresses among all seller's.  It is truly how an A-line dress should fit. The cut of the dress is accurate, it flows well and swings well on the human body"
5.0,Love my slim ties people love them n want to order the same ones
5.0,"very nice set ,Iove it"
5.0,"I was recently in the hospital for about 2 weeks and all the nurses wanted one. They see a lot of robes and everyone loved it and wanted one of these.<br />For me, the sleeves could be an inch or more longer. I get cold hands and although it's nice to wash hands without pulling up the sleeves I miss the added warmth of the longer sleeve.<br />Did I order by mistake?<br />Is there a longer sleeved version for me. This would be complete perfection for me if the sleeves covered my hands to the mid fingers and knukles.<br />I LOVE that the nicly sewn in belt is a bit high and the belt is sewn into the robe. Being made a part of the robe with a flat back without twisting or having it lost in wash or dragging on the floor is Wonderful.  I'm 5' 4"" tall &110 puonds and love the tailor fitted look!<br />It is just 2"" INCHES above the floor. I love that it is long and warmer this way too! I ordered the small size.<br /><br />For a tall person I think it would still be long I'm pretty sure the length would increase with size.<br /><br />I got the white one and find it to be a wonderful bright white like pure clean new fallen snow. I've washed it a few times and the fabric just gets better.<br />I will never buy any robe with an unattached belt again!<br /><br />Thank you, marshmallow robes, for making my days battling my illness a little more comfortable and definately better looking."
5.0,"Super comfortable! Fits my series 7 perfectly. Love the hexagonal shape of the holes, gives just a little bit more character."

5.0,Comfortable and very easy to wear.
5.0,Super cute.  Super price.
5.0,I love these. I have worn them for two weeks. My ears have not turned color or swelled.
5.0,"celtics fan, wanted to remember my  kitty whose # was sadly retired.  came very  next day, same area code as me. just as pictured, just the green is a bit darker and faded looking, but overall very pleased w/it.  solid, good lobster claw, great for what it is.  thank you"
5.0,"How CUTE is this dress? I loved the little tassels, wore it in mexico at the beach and at home to the pool/beach. Very festive and casually cute."
5.0,"Love these. I have been wearing shape-wear undershirts for years now. I literally can't leave the house without them. When I saw shape-wear panties, I said count me in. They are not ridiculous like a girdle restraining on you. They are quite comfortable, while still holding you in, which is exactly how my undershirts are. They are going to be super handy for after I give birth!! I'm super grateful that I was able to receive this for a discounted price in return for my honest review."
5.0,"Very nicely presented, wonderful as a gift for a young fan of Frozen!"
5.0,This is soooo cute my daughter absolutely loves it.  Great price too
5.0,"Customer service was awesome.  Fed X screwed up the delivery and LUST reshipped the Day Pack to me at no extra cost.  This time it arrive ahead of schedule and the quality of the back pack is everything I hoped it would be.  Huge and crafted from heavy leather, it's already drawing comments from my co-workers"
5.0,Arrived in two days. In perfect condition. Authentic Nixon. Nice leather band and numbers and hands glow at night. Very comfortable
5.0,I love this beanie!
5.0,Love It!..
5.0,"Love these glasses , actually to find fashionable readers as sunglasses I feel like I hit the trifecta! There very light, fit well, and I can still read what I want outside!!!"
5.0,"We've all had our share of cheap, thin Halloween costumes.  I was really impressed with this Snow White princess dress.  The skirt was a thick material, the bodice and cape were a high-quality velour texture, and the hoop under the skirt made it that much more regal.  All of this made for a very impressive costume!  I would highly recommend."
5.0,Good quality great price!
5.0,"I recieved this shirt a day earlier than my estimated delivery date, and I can't find a thing wrong with it. The crystal on the front, while not my favorite part of the shirt, is small and unobtrusive. It fits well and clings to all the right places, and is not too thin like I feared it might be. Good buy. Also, I followed the other reviewer's advice and ordered a size larger than I usually would. This turned out to be a good idea."
5.0,Really like the hat. Seems well made and looks great.
5.0,Love this title horse made well really cute luv it in my purse
5.0,What a beautiful pair of earrings ! I was having a  day and when they arrived wow! They truly made my day and the size is perfect not too big and not too small ! Will order if they have a variety!

5.0,I bought this gift for friends to do their grocery shopping. They loved them and said they were too good for grocery shopping they were using them as tote bag for vacation and ....
5.0,WE LOVE IT. GRACIAS
5.0,"Not exactly as pictured, but I love the top!<br />See pics included for a more accurate idea regarding style of top, also I noticed there's a shadow cross on back as seen in photo, I wasn't expecting that, but I'm ok with it~I would recommend this top to friends."
5.0,great quality .. wear it every day.  love it.  great company to work with.. clay
5.0,Love this look.
5.0,"Fantastic tie at the right price.  This is a review for the dark blue Spikerking Men's Ties New Classic Striped Necktie White Black Streak Neckties.  This is a very handsome and elegant tie.  I believe it can be worn for both business attire and a more casual look.  The quality compares favorably with much more expensive ties that you might find at your local mall.  The wide is not skinny, but not too wide either.  At first I thought that the tie was a little too long, but it was just about perfect once it was tied.  One word of caution is that it might be too long if you are shorter.  I am 6'.  The pattern is nice and is a classic design that should wear well for years to come.  Overall, I believe this tie is a very nice product at a very competitive price.<br /><br />I received this product at either no cost or at a deeply discounted price; in return, I am providing my honest and unbiased opinion, along with a brief description of my experience with the product, whether it be positive or negative. I have no connection to the company/seller, I am not required to write a positive review, and I am not receiving monetary compensation in anyway."
5.0,My daughter loves these socks!  They do not fade in the washer.
5.0,Beautiful dress! Very flattering!
5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my wife, she really loved them."
5.0,Good quality for the price - clear lenses - materials strong and flexible - which allowed me to adjust for a comfortable fit - style is more &#34;super trooper&#34; than I was hoping for but it's all good.
5.0,"Hood is thin and stretchy, but surprisingly warm. I work outside, and this is one of my MUSTS come wintertime."
5.0,It was all that I expected it to me & more!
5.0,"Love, love, love my 5th pair of Toms!"
5.0,Great fit- very well made. Looks nice and professional.
5.0,Looked and worked great.
5.0,This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He says the sound is great. It pairs more quickly than his Jaybird earbuds. He loves the convenience of running with only the warm hat and no hassle with Bluetooth earbuds.
5.0,Love it neatly perfect
5.0,I would absolutely recommend this skirt!
5.0,The wig is comfortable and with the cap it didn't make my head itch at all. I wore it for about 10 hours and it felt fine and stayed in place.
5.0,"Okay, so it's a little dorky, but it definitely does the job. I have long hair that I always wear pinned up, making hats challenging. This lets my bun stick out in the top/back and fits comfortably and securely. 3 years and I still wear it all summer long."
5.0,Wore  this for my bday brunch and it looked good! Got so many compliments and looked real fancy!  Skirt rides up occasionally but that’s normal. Would recommend  !!
5.0,"This cap is well constructed and comfortable. I was looking for a chef cap to keep my  hair out of the way and the tie back makes it very adjustable. Good value, well made, support small business."
5.0,Liked the 1st pair so much I bought 4 more. Wish there were some with navy BC stripes instead of just black
5.0,I love this dress!! So comfortable and flattering. The pockets are perfect and don't make the dress appear bulky. Dress is nice and long. I'm 5'8 and it hits the top of my feet.
5.0,"I love this sandals, just like I expected.<br />Thanks"
5.0,Fits my 2 1/2 year old perfectly!
5.0,"We got these for my brother who runs cross country and does other sports. Basically their perfect he is never without them. Like most eyeglasses his are expensive and an annoyance to replace which we've had to do more then once. Unlike other eyeglass holders these are more flexible. They actually bend behind the ear to fall against the back of the head. They were a good value and the colors are perfect for any male. And for some females as well.  The colors are red, white , black and silver."
5.0,Amazing quality! I use this clutch all the time and it not only looks great but holds up well to the abuse I put it through!
5.0,"Great shape!! Very cute, oversized"
5.0,"It's durable, very convenient as a replacement for both my wallet and old phone case, and it's camo.... 'merica! Thank ya Jesus!"
5.0,Great quality and looks beautiful!
5.0,"I followed the size chart, plus scrolled through some reviews and I ended up going with a medium. I’m 125 lbs, 34B/34C bra, and this fits like a glove. Super comfy, super lightweight, sheer but not see through, and the material feels soft of comfy right out of the package. Love it! I can honestly wear this with anything, anywhere. Super easy to dress up or down and it’s honestly super cute with a pair of jeans and converse. It could also serve as an undershirt, as it’s very form-fitting. Pat attention to the size chart and you should be good to go. This might run a tad on the small side, but that’s just my opinion having a larger bust for my body type."
5.0,Very nice dress. Good quality for the price and the fit is great! Will order again!
5.0,lovely.
5.0,Does what it needs to do! Good job
5.0,Best panties. Feels so good against your body
5.0,Nothing special here. Simple light weight sandals perfect for showering at the gym.
5.0,"Grand dtr, everyday wear"
5.0,"Haven't 'wash them yet but very comfortable to wear. I wanted  a pair with deep pockets, walked my 3 miles yesterday with stuff in the pockets and nothing fell out,"
5.0,"This is a beautiful, well made dress in a very flattering style. I'm 5'3&#34;, 200 and size 18 and it fit just right, though it is a clingy material so a shaping slip underneath is a good idea if you don't want every lump and bump to show. It's well made and bit thicker material but breathes well. In all I'm very pleased with it, especially for the price."
5.0,Very good quality and colors
5.0,Have to pull up tight to get them to fit my big calves.  Limited give.  I think that they will work well though.
5.0,Love them. Fit perfect
5.0,Love the shirts they feel very soft very happy with the purchase
5.0,"I've been needing some tanks to work out in and these were a perfect buy. I'm 6 foot 1 inch and I ordered the large and they fit great. The material is also breathable and comfortable. I will definitely purchase more, especially in light of the cost."
5.0,Love these workout shorts in a pattern- t<br />Different material
5.0,Really nice. I wanted to be able to switch it out at times with the dressier band my MK smartwatch originally came with for more of a everyday look. Also like that I can wear with my gold or silver Jewelry!
5.0,Cute and packaged beautifully... Love em
5.0,Better than expected! Great field of vision and super comfortable! Love the lense color I would definitely recommend!
5.0,The slippers arrived in time for Christmas and he liked them alot.

5.0,Just right for the daughter in my life...
5.0,Liked the versatility of color to change for any reason.
5.0,"Expensive but absolutely super quality sunglasses, which look great and are a pleas to wear.<br />Solid built and they fit well."
5.0,Go USA
5.0,Too big for a newborn. May be a better fit for 3 months and up. Very cute like the picture.
5.0,ｉhave been to wear to do exercise，ｉfeel conformable and soft ｉlike It
5.0,"Great quality for the price point, excellent functionality, and I rarely lose them since they're ON my glasses. So happy I found this product and hope they never stop making it!"
5.0,I got this as a gift for my friend for the summer time and he said it was very lightweight and comfortable. And it fit onto different sizes of sunglasses. The patterns are also super fun!
5.0,Looks great on my Coach bag!
5.0,"The product is of good quality, but doesn't wrap around your entire body, if it was wider, it would be better. But the price is reasonable."
5.0,"I'm 5&#34;7' and 145lbs with 34DDs and this leotard is the best that I've purchased & holds them in without having to use a sports bra. I have wide hips, so this fits as expected. I'll be buying more of these in the future. The clasps in the back and the padding help keep my chest in wonderfully."
5.0,I use these in the winter to combat the lights reflected off of snow in the northeast.
5.0,Holds through even thickest material. just be sure to slide magnets apart. very strong hold
5.0,Great mask.  It is easy to breathe and I get compliments on American flag.
5.0,Very nice jacket. I am extremely happy with it.
5.0,fit great and is cute
5.0,"Good quality, soft, and fit nicely."
5.0,Nephew and sister loved it!
5.0,Very cool shirt! Not cheaply made by any means either.
5.0,"Love this bra. Fits great, and love the V in the back."
5.0,Beautiful. Recieve lots of compliments. Can be adjusted to the perfect fit and is extremely flattering with the straps and tie back giving chosen leverage.
5.0,It doesn’t pinch your head. A great visor
5.0,A chain reaction was set off when my husband put the stainless steel chain necklace on for me to review. It looks great! The chain is not cheap and hollowed out. It is solid and  heavy in weight for a strong man like my hubby. The chain comes with a nice pouch to protect it from scratches. The box link style can be worn when dressed up or casual. The chain reaction was when he took off his shirt to model the chain in his muscle shirt. Lol. I received this product free or at a discounted price to review and give my honest opinion. The retail  price is low if you ask me. This is of great quality.
5.0,"I am very pleased with this item, it will make a great gift."
5.0,I'm short at 5' so these are more like yoga pants on me but I love them!
5.0,"Generous size small, good green color and it hides a surgical scar on my neck. I have a very old navy version that I still wear and wanted a second."
5.0,"Very nice looking,  excellent quality and very good price!  Thanks!"
5.0,"super cute and small, I love wearing this it's so comfy and I don't have to adjust it at all during the night which is great and it's subtle."
5.0,"I love this dress, fits well. I'm 5'4&#34; and it's a tad long but not bad at all. I bought it in 2 colors and want more."
5.0,"Beautiful piece if lingerie ladies, a must have for your collection, it is very durable and sexy !"
5.0,This is a nice looking key chain.
5.0,Wearing my skirt as I type. Fits great. Looks great.
5.0,"I love these glasses! Can’t beat the price, either! I get lots of compliments on them. I have a big face, and they fit perfectly."
5.0,"I love this thing! I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift. We always talked about how awesome it would be to have. It works! I think I’ll have to buy one for myself now! Shipped fast, came in nice packaging. I would recommend 100%."
5.0,My girlfriend wanted a bag for her apple computer and this is perfect . She loved the color and got lots of compliments from co workers

5.0,I like how they fit and also very comfy.
5.0,Very comfy shoes. Also don't slip. Great buy!
5.0,Tiempo de entrega y calidad
5.0,"Bought the dress for my wife on a whim. Fit well and looked great, will be looking at other products in the future."
5.0,"I was looking for a watch strap that cleanly hides the loose unused portion of the strap. This does that and it does it well.<br /><br />The material is smooth and comfortable to wear. It also grips well to hold the watch in place so the fitness sensors can do their thing accurately.<br /><br />I've been wearing the strap for 3 weeks now and see no evidence of the looseness issues mentioned by other reviewers. If that should change, I'll update my review."
5.0,Cute and beautiful but we had to glue in part of the pendant
5.0,well worth the price beautiful looks real
5.0,Es perfecto y tiene muy buena calidad. Justo como lo esperaba.
5.0,"It's long shoe horn.  It's hard for it not to work.  It does, I'm happy with it and the delivery and the price."
5.0,I got the white pearl drop necklace...very good dupe for the bauble bar one  3 x the price! Fun fad piece!
5.0,Great jacket. Not too bulky but keeps me pretty warm.
5.0,"Value, and quality"
5.0,I purchased fir a gift & my friend loves it!
5.0,"Honestly I Had low expectations for this dress because of how cheep it was, but, it turned out amazing and was super comfortable and it had a little bit of weight to it which I did not expect. I absolutely would buy this dress again and highly recommend it"
5.0,Fits as expected.  I order my regular size. I intend to wear it under a one shoulder tight black dress.  It holds the girls in without squishing them.  I actually used it paddle boarding to get rid of bikini tan and it worked perfectly.  Will be buying a second!
5.0,I ordered this for my nine year old. She loves it!
5.0,Such a great keychain for the price!  Each piece was individually wrapped so no scratches on the beautiful silver pieces.  Thank you!
5.0,I LOVE the way this sports bra feels! It is so supportive and comfy! Could even be styled as a crop top if you so wish!! Everyone should have this in their closet!!
5.0,"Soo soft , I use them underneath full face helmet for motorcycle to protect form dust and cold wind at night does exactly what u would want if I ever need more definitely will purchase again ( I loose things easy )"
5.0,"I loved  traveling with it. The crossover straps left my hands free and the zipper closing made it secure. It held a lot inside and in its many pockets. My water bottle leaked and the fabric dryed quickly. I would rather not have had the 2 short straps which I had to hide inside the pockets. Overall, a very useful tote."
5.0,Very pleased with purchase. I really like that it zips closed. The texture is nice. Bag is just the right size.
5.0,Quality belt that fits comfortably.
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress. Wore it for a wedding and it was perfect. I'm about 5'3&#34; 135 lbs normally size 5ish or medium. Ordered a medium and it fit well. The off the shoulder sleeves stayed in place, I didn't find myself pulling the dress up in the front or fidgeting with it much at all."
5.0,Such a great deal for the price beautiful shirt
5.0,I ordered two sizes up and it fits a little big but ok.
5.0,Great glasses! Love the color and polarizing lenses. Great fit and feel great on my face. Might buy another pair!
5.0,We love all of the unique designs on Amazon kids clothing and the quality is unmatched. I would compare it to Target's Cat and Jack brand. Will always buy Amazon just because I know no one else's kids will have the same prints and colors.
5.0,"Wore my top this weekend. Great fit, soft fabric and beautiful print. Looks nice with jeans, but can be dressed up, too. True to size, relaxed fit, not fitted."
5.0,Looks and fits great! I love it.
5.0,Love this company-vegan & donates to lions and other endangered species
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! It is a little bit though. How can I adjust this to fit smaller?
5.0,I use this a few times a day. Everyday. It's the perfect addition to have around for my car keys to QD from a backpack or other bag. It's the perfect balance between being able to easily detach them and also trust that they're not going to fall off or get snagged on a tree branch. They hit a home run when they made this and I'll be buying more.
5.0,"These bottoms are FABULOUS! I am 5'7&#34; with all of my height coming from my super long torso. Generally, anything that claims to be &#34;high waisted&#34; always falls below my belly button. I weigh 225 and wear a 14/16 in jeans and was worried these bottoms would be too small. As a rule of thumb I ordered the largest size they had and they fit great. The leg holes are just big enough, not tight but definitely not a lot of wiggle room, however, the top that covers the belly has lots of room and plenty of stretch to it! The best part...THEY COVER MY BELLY BUTTON AND THEN SOME!!!!!!!! These are worth so much more than $13!!! I love them!!"
5.0,"Even better in person, these earrings are beautiful. I was so sad they did not come in time to wear to my event. They would be perfect as wedding earrings too. Sparkly and not gaudy at all."
5.0,"i dont have those specific ones, but i owned a nearly identical pair but they just broke. does anyone know where i can get them in that colour? any help is appreciated"
5.0,Hat was everything i thought it would be. Just as pictured and fits perfectly.
5.0,"Simple, practical<br />Manly stylish and dynamic."
5.0,"I am not going to lie, when I bought this I had not read all of the specs. It was in the price range I wanted and it looked good. When it arrived I instantly noticed the chest straps and NEEDED to try it out. It fit me so well and I look forward to trying this out with new activities."
5.0,"Incredibly comfortable, very flattering, and best of all it has pockets."
5.0,Really cute! I received a lot of compliments when I wore this.
5.0,Just as pictured cute short shorts a little tight at first
5.0,Super cute graphic tee. Ordered because I saw a blogger post it. Love it. Fits tts and looks just like the picture

5.0,"Great purchase, thank you!"
5.0,I love these! I use them for yoga and Pound

5.0,Love the color and style
5.0,Amazing quality!!
5.0,"This is a great Tunic! It is nice and thick - very well made! The color is not chocking at the top - but it is nice and high! I was told to order a size bigger, but I think it is almost a little big now. I usually order a medium, but I ordered a large to be safe. I will still be able to wear it but I probably would prefer a little smaller. It also is nice and long. I am 5'8"" and it goes to my knees! I would recommend this!!"
5.0,"Love the light material, perfect for summer."
5.0,Love the purse. Picture doesn't do it justice.
5.0,Bought a batch of these for my team at work.  Now we look cool.  Amazing how much team spirit one can buy for 7 bucks a head.
5.0,"So I wont lie, I was going after the tony start look. These did exactly that. Same color and actually pretty comfy. Def a diff flair to aviators."
5.0,We use these on our trips and they are great!
5.0,This outfit is thee bomb.com it fits beautifully I am 165 & 5'5 thick with PLENTY of assets in the back & I ordered an 2x & the outfit fits perfectly I usually wear an XL or 1x but by reading the reviews I seen size up so I did and I am very happy with my decision
5.0,"Made well, fun to eear"
5.0,"Very nice packaging good quality,my boyfriend loved it.i recommend this product to buy for a gift who love shades."

5.0,Do you hate to iron? Well iron no more! So thankful for this time saver.
5.0,Like them. Good quality.
5.0,"These are a great basic top I use for running. I typically wear a medium or large in shorts and ordered a medium. Glad I did, these fit perfectly loose and are pretty airy and light, not see through."
5.0,"These leggings are so soft and comfortable! The color is as described, and best of all my big phone (galaxy note 9) fits perfectly in the pockets. Im 5'2"" about 166lbs and usually wear a size L. These are large, but I think a medium would have given me a tighter fit. I love how high waisted they are. Overall I highly recommend these. I will be ordering more in different colors :)"
5.0,My daughter is 5 and is very small framed. finding masks that fit her was extremely difficult. These were the perfect fit!
5.0,I bought these because I wanted a small huggie set to hang dangling earrings on. These are perfect.
5.0,Nice bag and quality product
5.0,Breathable and very comfortable!
5.0,I am using my partners account so an leave a photo. I did buy from this seller. They are perfect  for crafts. I did a milk jug witch project and they are still going strong a month later. We will pack them away and use them again. You can bend the rims and decorate them.
5.0,high quality item.  nicer than a cheaper and flimsier type like most.  This one might last you awhile.  Worth the extra money for this one.
5.0,She Loved them
5.0,I love these I would get compliments from everyone.  I loss my pair and I'm wondering when you guys will have them in stock again??
5.0,Huge bag.  Good quality bag for the price
5.0,This tee is soft and chic. Great with colored Jean's or yoga pants. Will be gifting this. It fits great and is a great length.
5.0,I love my prayer shawl !!
5.0,"I have only worn these, one time, and that was for three hours.  But did a fair amount of walking.  They are quite comfortable.  These have enough extra width, that I can wear socks with them."
5.0,glad I ordered it.  perfect size
5.0,AMAZINGLY.COMFORTABLE AND VERY STYLISH!!! The pockets are a fun plus! Dafe to order a size down and you will still have a lot of flow and comfort.

5.0,"Love this item. I can't believe how well it fits my ear, I forget I'm wearing it."
5.0,"I've had great experience with this brand in the past, and their small fits me really well, so I figured it was safe to order a dress for my bridal shower with only a week of buffer time. I'm small on top, with most of my weight below my waist, so the flare of this dress is perfect and flattering. I got tons of compliments and was comfortable and confident!"
5.0,Great for late season wary ducks.
5.0,This sports bra fits great and is so comfortable!
5.0,"It fits wonderful, it's a perfect fit. And looks great just as the picture."
5.0,"Mother's Day necklace more beautiful than expected! Pendant and chain go with everything! Came in a lovely box on a card with special  saying, pink flowers and a pink heart, gift bag, gift card, wrapping paper, cleaning cloth, a silver saver  bag to keep necklace in when not wearing it , free 5 year  warranty, 15% off next purchase and  a personal ""Thank You"" message from Efy. I wear my necklace nearly every day!  THANK YOU Efy, and EFYTAL JEWELRY. DEFINITELY WILL ORDER AGAIN!"
5.0,"Use these in the hospital for labor, super comfy and I even wear them as everyday socks now 6 months later."
5.0,Love the fit and the material which is very nice for those cooler days. It conforms nicely as the material will give yet still clings so no sliding down when you are active.
5.0,"I love this item. Literally my third time buying it but the only downfall is that when you drop it, it will definitely break"
5.0,Fits just right as I do not like shirts that are tight.  Sleeves are long so you can either cuff them or push up.  I wear it cuffed and it is perfect.
5.0,"Really cute and sexy anklet. Perfect fit. Little beads is a great touch of elegance yet can be worn everyday. Goes well with dressy, causal or lounge wear."
5.0,This is really really cool! The queality of the suit amazing but be careful the sizes really run small! My son is 7 y and wears a size small or 7/8 I ordered the size xl and it fits just right so what I’m trying to say it’s not gonna last him long
5.0,I love the quarter zip feature for getting over my little ones head. The color is lovely and quality is great.
5.0,The shoes are so so so so cute!<br />Granddaughters love them and they seem to be very comfortable for them!
5.0,A great product . Comfortable and nice fit . 100% cotton .
5.0,Super fun and sexy
5.0,An excellent staple for my postpartum recovery.
5.0,"Ordered this for my gf for my dads wedding on the beach. Be aware that it doesn’t look exactly like the photo but it was still great! It was a little bit of a darker grey. The material was nice and light so it was perfect for the beach. It wasn’t THAT see through but an undershirt will definitely be needed. It can be worn dressed up or dressed down, however you prefer."
5.0,"I love these leggings! I’m 5’2” and weigh 185. I just recently started going to the gym again after having 2 open heart surgeries and a heart transplant in 6 months. These made me feel comfortable and confident as I gained a lot of weight being so inactive for so long. Great material, durability and no sheerness. The pocket is the BEST."
5.0,"This is now my favorite sweater!  Want expecting that because of the price,  but it fits perfect,  is cozy, looks great,  and I get so many compliments!"
5.0,"The  shirt fit true to size. Very nice material, you can dress it up or down and went very well with my choice of oufit. Wish they had in black. Would order shirt again."

5.0,"I where the shoes ""sockless"" and they feel great."
5.0,"Shipping was fast, product was packaged very nicely. I was originally concerned with the quality of the product because they were so cheap but they are very well made. These are the only shoes my daughter doesn't try to take off. Will definitely be ordering more colors of these!"
5.0,"These earrings are so cute and awesome! The only downfall of these earrings are that they are actually kinda heavy? I don’t recommend jumping and doing quick movements with them haha, I got it as a gift for my ex-bestfriend and she loved it!!"
5.0,This was a nice outfit for my Granddaughter. Great quality and price. She loves it!
5.0,My nephew Birthday party was beautiful

5.0,I love the soft feel and I can’t live without pockets. It lays well and I get many questions where I got this.
5.0,"Love this blouse. I ordered the large, but I should have ordered the Medium. It's a loose fit shirt the color is a gorgeous red. The instructions on the label says dry clean only. I washed it on delicate cycle and dyed it in the dryer (hoping it will shrink a little) The blouse didn't shrink and came out perfect.<br />I will be ordering from Dokotoo other colors."
5.0,"I bought and used this backpack for 6 flights, and 8 days trekking and hiking through Tanzania.  I could not have been happier with it!  All the pockets and water protection worked perfectly.  The construction is sturdy and durable for being thrown about.  I'm so happy that I bought this backpack.  Bought the gray - and loved it."
5.0,"I'm a woman. 5', 107 lbs. Ordered mens small. Fits slouchy but not sloppy. Calf area is a little snug. Like the fabric, soft, washes and dries nicely."
5.0,This set of beanie with gloves is awesome. The ear flaps help block the wind and keep your ears warm in bitter cold winds. The gloves function well enough to answer a phone call or change tracks on my phone. If there's high humidity with the cold it has a little bit of trouble.
5.0,Great Look 👍  and fit .
5.0,"I was skeptical about these when I ordered them. But I was like they are only 10 dollars i'll give it a try. I LOVE THESE. They are comfortable, stretch, light weight, do not ride up, and affordable. I will be buying a few more packs of these. Strongly recommend."

5.0,She loved it!
5.0,I needed to replace a watch band for my smart watch. It worked perfectly. Great buy
5.0,This strap works as well as the Nano Vista strap and can be adjusted the same way as well.
5.0,I'm surprised how much I love this garment! It's fun and classy looking. It is also great for hiding an after-Thanksgiving feast belly. Probably would work to hide a baby in there for a while. So comfortable I could use it for nightwear. Great for layering. The fabric is light-weight and comfortable. The sleeves fit at a very flattering point on a woman's arms. The neck is versatile--I think it sould be re-named the 4-way tunic since wearing the cowl as a hood counts as a variation. Now I want others in different colors. Maybe i've found a signature piece for my minimalist wardrobe. This is so versatile I could wear one every day.
5.0,Fits well. Fun pattern.
5.0,Was a gift for my wife. They fit as expected she loves them.
5.0,"bought for my daughter who is 5'9"" and it fit great, looks amazing. soft feel, great colors, the ruffles add a little dressup to the look which is nice."
5.0,I got this for my Dad and he loved it! Fit well
5.0,"Beautiful print, fits well."
5.0,"Great value, fit perfect"
5.0,"Great little bag. I bought it for quick trips on a motorcycle to hold my wallet, cellphone, and garage door opener. Works great and is of good quality. With the top open it can snugly hold two 22’s of beer."
5.0,"Perfect fit, my son loves it; ordered another one."
5.0,The person love it<br />They use it for work
5.0,Watch works just fine definitely would recommend buying one if your the type just not to like big watches or just wanna get a steal for a classic at this price point. DEFINITELY would recommend changing out the stock band that comes in it for either a silicon replacement like I did or nato makes it fun to wear and a lot cooler!<br /><br />Update<br />After a couple months of using this little bad boy I can still say this the best bang for your buck!
5.0,These earrings set my dress off! I felt like a Celebrity!! They are lightweight and look just as described and pictured.
5.0,Love them so nice. Bright and gold. Fits and looks perfect. I was so glad to get a set of three. I've been looking but I knew AMAZON would have them. Buy them. You won't be sorry.  BJ. Fl
5.0,Beautiful. Well made.
5.0,"This is such a beautiful watch, I love it and get so many compliments for it. I take it off while I take a shower or wash dishes even though  its water proof. I want to take very good care of it. I live that it came with the tool to take a link out. Thank you for that."
5.0,Great fit but recommend a size bigger.
5.0,"She loves it, wears it every chance she can"
5.0,Beautiful sparkle and the perfect size.
5.0,Totally believable!
5.0,I bought this to use with my Indian Scout. It works great! I put it on the handle bars with no issues. Really makes me feel comfortable leaving my helmet with the bike when going in places!
5.0,great price good compression solid socks.
5.0,Waiting for our flapjack shirt to complete the costume. Mr Baby (18 months) loves it.
5.0,"Really like how soft this fabric is, yet it still holds my hair back. I also like how I can scrunch it up for a thin headband look. The soft blue is my favorite color."
5.0,They're awesome sauce and keep my feet cool and toasty at the same time
5.0,"I just received these gloves in the mail today, which is perfect since I wasn't expecting them to be delivered (from China) until early September! They are thin black leather (you can definitely smell the leather), lined with polyester and have a little leather ""tab"" on the bottom inside of the glove to help slide them down. The fit is perfect, they may look loose when you hold your hand flat but they fit nice and snug once you make a fist. These will serve perfectly for my photoshoot, but considering they are lined they'll probably wear well for daily driving too. I would recommend this purchase (especially for the price) if you are on the fence.<br /><br />In case anyone might need measurements because they're unsure of sizing: 7"" from the base of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger and 3.5"" across (when the glove is laying flat). Fitting: the base of glove came to my wrist (perfectly where my hand meets arm), and about 1"" below the knuckle of my pinky finger."
5.0,looks just like in the picture I didn't realize I had to pierce my ear to wear this. but after I did it looks great. also it comes with one for each ear. so you don't need to buy two.
5.0,Husband loves it..
5.0,"Great ring, love the finish. Only problem was that it's a half a size too big! No worries, I will purchase another. Definitely worth it"
5.0,the picture gives off the idea this belt buckle is bigger than what it really is which I was super happy to find out that wasn't true it fit well with my custom made leather belt would definitely recommend this belt buckle and buy it again for another belt I'd say fair priced especially what I've paid for nickel belt buckles
5.0,This necklace has been the best gold plated jewelry that I have found that does not break me and my daughter out or turn our skin black or green and it does not turn colors or tarnish. My daughter and I have not ever been able to wear jewelry without it being 100% real and that got really expensive but now that I have found this we will definitely be purchasing more. The material is made from hypoallergenic materials so it don’t cause irritation and breakouts and it is always shiny gold no matter if you wear it during a shower or in the rain it still looks brand new afterwards! This necklace is a game changer and I plan to purchase many more in the future!
5.0,"We had to return the product because I purchased the wrong size....thinking a large child would be big enough for my petite 12 year old.  It was just a tiny bit too small.  However, the quality of the product was good, and if it had been big enough for her, we would have definitely kept it.  I would recommend it."
5.0,"Nice, heavy, and smooth.  Looks great"
5.0,"Wonderfully soft, and perfect for breastfeeding!"
5.0,Love this small backpack. It's a perfect go-pack to keep sketching supplies on hand.
5.0,It's made well and the material is so nice. Fits great. Fits as expected
5.0,Beautiful bracelet and excellent price
5.0,Perfect fit! I'm 5'5&#34; 122 lbs. I ordered an extra small!
5.0,Matches with my silver bracelets and gold bracelets and is dainty and perfect for my wrist. Got this for two of my best friends and we all match now.
5.0,"This purse was a gift for my friend, and she love's it.  She said it was the perfect size.<br />The color was great.  I was very happy and satisfied with this purchase to give as a<br />gift.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Pamela Tober"
5.0,"Love this purse! With 3 zippered compartments on the outside & 2 on the inside I can organize everything. Update 5/14/2020; the navy color is awesome.  I have the black, khaki & now the blue. I would buy more if they had more colors."
5.0,"I'm planning a kitschy retro vow renewal and have been shopping for a headpiece. I was facing paying 2-5X this price for a birdcage veil or an imported from the UK cocktail hat that I would probably never wear again So I hopped over here where it's not only cheaper but I can also send it back if it looks crappy. (Thanks, Prime!)<br /><br />I went with the A-Black version. It is just as versatile as the photos would have you believe. You can fold the tulle under or tweak it to cover some or all of your face. It holds its shape well. It seems well made. It also has two clips to secure it while many others on Amazon only seem to have one. They can get a little tangled in your hair and you'll probably lose a few strands removing them but that also says they'll keep your hat where you wan it! I was wary of the polka dot tulle but it's actually really fun in person.<br /><br />I don't love the feather part sticking out from the top. The person who I asked for a second opinion says it &#34;adds balance&#34;. I'm still on the fence. At any rate, you can very easily cut those off at the point where they're attached. without anyone knowing they were ever there."
5.0,"Love these!  Good price, good fit, good gripping power on the mat."
5.0,I love this dress and how it fits. I received many loving compliments. The length was just perfect
5.0,"I’m just about quite going shopping in stores, find what size works and have it in a day or two. If it doesn’t fit or look right it’s easy to send back."
5.0,Well made.  Very nice product.
5.0,Great hat for a costume. Fits good and looks good. Would buy again if needed. Great for pictures as well.
5.0,These earrings are beautiful!! I got them for my wife and she absolutely loved them. They are so beautiful. The post are smaller than I thought they would be but none the less they are really beautiful! They are well made too.
5.0,Very cute... Pretty color
5.0,Got in 3 colors.  Always get a compliment when i wear on!
5.0,Almost exactly like my C -0ndor S-mmit but 1/2 the price. 6’ 240 usually wear XL but ordered XxxL and am happy I made that decision.  Please read the reviews and upsize suggestions and you’ll be happy. MULTIkAM ocp style look great and very true to original pattern unlike others.
5.0,My wife loves these; the rose gold is probably her favorite sun-glass right now. Very pretty.
5.0,I like the material this band is made from. It seems very durable and comfortable.
5.0,I typically wear a medium but ordered a large and fits great. Does come down low so be prepared for clevage.ive had this shirt for several years now and it has held up very well.
5.0,Stretch two pairs of pants about two inches. Worked really good
5.0,"Love it, fits perfectly, really light and thin, will be great for summer heat! Ordering more!"
5.0,This is a great fit and durable.  You cannot find a better option.
5.0,"The color is a bit darker than the photo, and it still works for me.  Very well made and easy to get into.  Soft and the main handles ride perfectly on my shoulder.  I'm really glad I bought this bag."
5.0,"love them!! simple, pretty. I got a few compliments just the first time wearing. I can definitely feel them (weight) but i also usually wear studs. they definitely werent heavy enough to be bothersome."
5.0,I love the material. So cute!
5.0,Great looking Alabama ring. It has minimal flaws and arrived without issues. It didn’t come in a box but it was packaged nicely without any stones missing. It runs a tad bit small so if you plan on wearing it order a size up.
5.0,"Bought for my MIL and 2 aunts going to Disney and they loved them! Good quality and very cute. Would probably be big (still cute) on a small child, but fit well and a bit less bulky on the adults. Stayed in place well. Faces cropped for privacy but hopefully you can see that they didn’t look too big or too small while being worn around the park"
5.0,The band came and was a great replacement for my stock Samsung Gear S3 band. Fitment was perfect and love the quick release feature.
5.0,"These are incredible, stylish, comfortable and durable. I bought all the colors."
5.0,I absolutely love this dress!! I am 5'1 with a 40&#34; waistline so I ordered the XXL. The fit was perfect. I received quite a few compliments. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who is thinking about purchasing.  You won't be disappointed.
5.0,Great hat.  I had to have the gloves shortened since I was giving it to my 7 year old niece but she loved and still wears it years later.
5.0,"I like this cardigan. Perfect for the office. It's lightweight so it won't be warm or anything, but it's the perfect cover-up. Love the color options. I'm 5'2 140lbs and ordered a medium and it fits perfect."
5.0,The colors are exactly like the pic
5.0,Fit great.<br />As good as original Oakley lenses.
5.0,"My 8 yr old daughter is one of 2 flower girls in a June wedding. This dress is lightweight, comfortable, pretty, very well made, and suitable for girls a few years to young to be junior bridesmaids, and too old for little girl flower girl dresses. We bought the ivory, and it's a light ivory. Looks white unless it's right next to white."
5.0,We have several of this type and found them to be a good value for the money. Had to return for exchange since it was noisy but seller was very helpful and quick to respond to inquiry as well as quick to exchange merchandise.
5.0,"This product was great. Unlike brush applicators, the product goes farther because there are no bristles absorbing the product. Coloring and texturizing went faster."
5.0,"This dress is ADORABLE! I actually bought it as a back-up dress because I didn’t think I would get another dress in time for a party. However, even though I got the other dress, I still wore this one because it was sooooo cute. I wore it with a petticoat, white tights and also added a thin white patent leather belt. It was definently one of the best outfits at the party!<br /><br />The poplin cotton material is thin, but it is much better quality than I originally thought it would be. It also does run EXTREMELY small, so pay attention to what others say about the sizing.<br /><br />Overall. I would highly recommend this dress."
5.0,Love these socks!!!
5.0,I like that this style is a bit longer than some other ugly Christmas dresses. I was able to wear it to work no problem. Goes well with leggings or tights for the cold weather. Fairly cheap material as you might expect for the price.
5.0,Fits nice and looks cute.
5.0,It was a gift for my niece and she loved it!
5.0,"It’s so cute I love it, It holds<br />Up nice, and a good size"
5.0,Favorite sweatshirt right now. Contemplating buying another for when I wear out this one....
5.0,"Sexy and hot. The perfect langth.  They have some weight but not to have, adds a little something to any outfit  if want that little sparkle this is perfect  the price was just right. Definitely worth it"
5.0,These earring are perfect!!!
5.0,I really like this sweatshirt. That's the second one I bought.
5.0,"For almost a month I was in excruciating pain in my middle index finger which would not go down. In Califonia that qualifies as &#34;driving disabilty.&#34; I used various herbs, pain killers but found that if I put this on my finger (as I did with another brand) it felt good during the day and seemed to slowly heal. I'm now about 95% l healed this finger. There is no magic wand on this kind of problem. It's incremental healing. These do a great job."
5.0,Got them for my daughter. They’re adorable. Love the style.
5.0,"Very cute, would like to order more colors"
5.0,Item as described and quick shipping.
5.0,"Nice blouse, like the cute and it looks very imple yet a bit elegant. Material is ok,but the cut makes this blouse look great."
5.0,"Soft material, back snaps all the way down, vibrant colors"
5.0,Super pretty! The band certainly dressed up my Alta. Easy to snap on too. Be sure to watch the video on how to change the band size its quite simple.
5.0,"Super cozy, fits perfect!"
5.0,"I ordered these to wear as under shirts when I wear an open sweater or hoodie or something. I usually wear an xl-xxl in tops so I ordered xxl in these. They are definitely NOT compression if you order your normal size, but they are slim fitting and flattering at the waist. If you want compression I'd recommend to order 1-2 sizes down."
5.0,"Cute and warm. Stylish enough for my 10 year old to wear, and that’s saying something!"
5.0,"Ordered as I need a few dresses, I love this dress well made, I am 5'2"" and weight 109, I ordered a Small and its looks and fits fine, it is a lovely material and drapes nice on the body.  Now I will tell you it says its RED, if you are looking for true red you will not like it is a sort of rust, orange, red, that is the best I could describe it.  I wanted a color like that so I am happy with it.  Look at the model carefully and you will see the true color."
5.0,"I bought this dress as a birthday gift for my niece, and the sizing was right on, and it is nicely made and looks great on her!! I will definitely purchase from this seller again! Thank you!"
5.0,Better than I expected.. Haven't taken them off yet several complements on them
5.0,"LIUMILAC Women Casual 3/4 Bell Sleeve Tiered Loose Aline Swing Dress with Lace<br />Size Medium - I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs. The medium fits great!<br /><br />This dress is really flowy! I love the tiers and the lace inserts on the sleeves. The dress is super comfortable. Really nice material and very well made. The material is great and the lace is soft and pretty. Highly recommend this dress. Hope you find this review and photos helpful! 5 Stars!"
5.0,Great fit and materials. One of my favorite tees
5.0,"These are amazing, comfortable, great fit and slimming!  I am ordering more."
5.0,Love!!  I’m a Journey/Steve Perry fan🤗🥰
5.0,"This was super cute, my only issue was with the cap. The packaging left the cap really smashed, it was tucked with the shirt. If we didn't have such a hard time getting the cap back to shape this would've been perfect. I still recommend this product, cause the set is really cute."
5.0,"Lots of pockets and space( I keep my wallet, glasses, keys and kindle separately)<br />Light weight<br />Good quality<br />Nice on the shoulder<br />Nice casual look<br />Love it"
5.0,"Perfect!  Seems 100% cotton, has on seam pockets that lay flat, exposed back zip and wide elastic waist band in the back.  Based on reviews I ordered a size XXL even though in US sizes I'm an 8-10 in pants/skirts and it fits great - I can pull the skirt on without undoing the zipper but it won't fall down.  I'm only 5 feet tall and this hits a few inches below my knee.  Great purchase, fast shipping, nice packaging."
5.0,"This is a great wear anywhere dress. I’m 5’10 and it hit me mid calf in the front and about two inches above my heal in the back. Comfortable, cute and it has pockets! I bought the large and I normally wear a 14, 38DD"
5.0,"They are very cute and comfy to wear, and when I'm out shopping or running errands  I have gotten nothing but complements from  other woman wanting to know we here I bought them."
5.0,Good. Came early.Good gor the price
5.0,"This was bought for my daughter to wear on her wedding day from her step dad, she feel in love with it"
5.0,"After years of burning feet and calf muscle pain, in two words: ""They work!""."
5.0,"They are a bit itchy, but it's deal-with-able. I am 5'7"", 230 lbs., and a 38DD in the bust - I ordered an XXL and they fit perfectly. We'll see how these do in keeping me dry during my runs. The sleeves are a bit long, but that's fine with me since I like to pull sleeves down over my hands. Ultimately, I'd recommend."
5.0,"I am a curvy girl and I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! It fits very well, and it's so flattering!! I'll look for pictures to post later. I am a size 18/20 and I got a 2X. I didn't have to worry about the girls escaping or anything."
5.0,Great belt for the price. Nicely made
5.0,I love love love these pants! I had a pair back in the day and it’s too cool they are coming back. The fabric is super soft! These pants are very comfortable! I wear them for casual wear and have dressed them up! Very versatile!
5.0,"Very cute, material too thin though."
5.0,"Great fit, stylish, and comfortable! I’m 5’3, 114lbs, 32DD and wear size Small."
5.0,The socks feel lite and cushioned. They do fit more snug then other run/hiking socks I have worn but it doesn't bother me.
5.0,"As written in this heading, I love this watch. I had one similar to it but my older sister saw the one I was wearing so I gave it to her. I searched high and low for another and there it was. I have three others ( black, purple and pink )."
5.0,I love this charm because it goes well with the other charms. I’m happy with my purchase.
5.0,"These were a gift for my girlfriends ""my tribe"". They loved them and I wear mine daily."
5.0,I gave these to the staff at my doctors office. They loved them. Great colors . They were so well priced I wanted to keep one for myself. They were thick and soft. For regular size hands if there is such a thing. Several people tried them on and fit them.
5.0,Love the product.  I sweat at night under the covers.
5.0,Super cute & I love them!
5.0,"Perfect shoe! It is cute, trendy, and sooooooo comfortable!"
5.0,I got this for my dad so he'd stop walking around in his underwear (no one wants to see that)
5.0,I got this for my 16 yr old daughter. She has received many compliments! It is very nice and sparkly!! It is perfect for her.
5.0,"Christmas present, husband loves it."
5.0,"It fits well, its flowy and was what I expected."
5.0,Bought for my boyfriend. He loved it! very nice
5.0,Love love love these luggage tags!! they are so cute and super easy to write on but i do wish they had a little more room to write for the address but over all i love these and they didn't come undone or anything during flight transfers!!
5.0,Adorable :) Very pleased with the product.
5.0,"This product works great for keeping all the small things from rolling around in your bag.  I loaded the pad up and everything stayed in place as advertised.  It also keeps your bag from becoming stuffed with pens and miscellaneous things, and streamlines all of your gear to fit in your bag like just another notebook."
5.0,Love them! I bought 3 pairs.
5.0,"Purchased this to where to clinical as its now a requirement. The quality is very nice and sturdy. Looks cute as far as bonnets go, and it covers all of my natural hair. Just an idea, if they were satin lined i wouldn't need to wear my scarf under to protect my hair. But great product!"
5.0,Fits good. A little short in crouch
5.0,"I got these for my daughter to use when we go to a concert next month, but my Mom has been using them at her dialysis center to help reduce noise so she can take a nap. We are all very happy with the headphones."
5.0,These shorts have become my favorite workout shorts to wear. The fabric is very breathable and comfortable and the length is perfect for what you look for in a running short.
5.0,Quick delivery & beautiful in person
5.0,"I really like these socks, they provide good compression but feel like regular socks rather than hosiery. I found they fit true to size as listed in the size chart."
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this brand because their sunglasses are so stylish and SO affordable. I also loved that they actually fit my face. I have a pretty Narrow face so most of the time sunglasses don’t fit my face correctly and will fall off my face if I look down. These don’t! I love cat eye sunglasses and I would repurchase these 100 times over!
5.0,"Love the ease and durability of these shoes for my boys to put them by themselves (8 and 5 years old) on to play outside, head to the beach and or down to the dock!!!  Item came just as described and love the color!"
5.0,My husband loves these socks there very comfortable easy to put on take off.  Makes his legs feel good.
5.0,Cute. I like tye little soft part for tye top of the head. Only thing that wouldve made it better wouldve been an adjustable strap cause it was pretty tight.
5.0,"I bought these for my 1 year old granddaughter who lives in NYC.  They are easy to get on, to adjust for keeping them on, warm, cute, and the string thru the coat is just what my father did with me! Easy to take them off without dropping and losing them!!<br />Highly recommend them for small children!"
5.0,i bought this as a christmas gift for a friend. she loved them!<br />they look well made and very warm.
5.0,Functional and stylish.
5.0,Nice quality and thick nylon and reinforcement. Fit pretty accurate to waist size. I bought up a size per other reviews. I figured better to strap then snug than be tight with no adjustment.
5.0,Good quality construction.  Easy to move around in. Nice material.
5.0,I would size up on this dress but other than that I adore this dress so comfy and I seriously have gotten so many compliments on it! So of course I bought another one so now I have the black and red one!!!
5.0,Fit great. Still looks like new after several washings.
5.0,Every year I buy one for my sobriety.  It's my gift to myself for staying sober.  Great keychains
5.0,bought small for my 8 yr old who is normally 10/12 and it runs almost too small.. but soo very cute
5.0,"This Shoe Horn is SOOooooo well built, I think you could dig with it in the hardest ground even though it's not intended for such, it's as strong as any shovel!! LOL  My Husband LOVES this because he's got some Altra Shoes that the Dr. had him get recently to help his broken foot and they were so hard to get on that he dreaded putting them on every morning and this Shoe Horn has made it a DREAM to get those shoes on now!!  LOVE THIS, THANK YOU!!"
5.0,Love! Works best with a lower cut shirt so you can see the crescent .
5.0,Overall the material is great and comfortable. Only issue I have is the neck hole is a little small as I struggled getting my head through.
5.0,Most comfortable leggings I've bought from amazon.
5.0,"I like the stretchy material. Even after washing and drying it, the fabric remained the same."
5.0,"I love the dress, just DO NOT buy size up.  I ended up giving it away"
5.0,"Beautiful dress! Not a super cheap quality, like I had expected. I ordered a 5-6, as my daughter is petite, but I would recommend maybe ordering a size up. We have gotten so many compliments this holiday season!"
5.0,It fits great and it's just beautiful.The material is soft and thin.The only problem was that it didn't come when expected but couple of days after.
5.0,"Really cute suit. Usually wear a medium. I ordered an XL. The crochet part did kinda stretch out a bit in the water, but wasn't horrible. It is very low cut, so my c cup boobs were a little precarious at times, situated in the suit. Feels good quality and I  would order again."
5.0,Excellent fabric! Beautiful design. Would buy again
5.0,I think they may run a bit large
5.0,"Lots of veterans here in San Antonio, and have already been complemented because usually everyone has the same hat...Excellent!"
5.0,Love this bag! Just the right size to carry everything a grandma needs for outings with my grandkids. A different compartment for everything! I park a little ways from work and this bag is easier to put around me than a purse. Good purchase!
5.0,Super cute. Great for fall.
5.0,This is the second dress I have bought from Miusol and I can say I am quite pleased. The only downfall to this dress is the pleat in the front center and back center. I have a bigger booty so that makes the pleat pop out in a weird way and I had to sew it to keep from doing that. Definitely cannot wear a petticoat with it but looks gorgeous just as is and is a nice vintage styling for a professional setting.
5.0,"My boyfriend has nerve damage on his elbow I gave him this, he wears it on the bad days. He says the feeling is hard to describe, but like it tingles."
5.0,These slippers are very comfortable and warm. The fleece is cozy. The foam is soft. The top looks nice. And the bottom is anti-slip.
5.0,A+ quality
5.0,I like them. Comfortable and Don't slip off the heel
5.0,"Cute shirt, nice quality."
5.0,Very cute and festive. Fit was comfortable.
5.0,"This review is for the Desmiit shorts with pockets in *tag* size L. I have a 32&#34; waist and these shorts fit snug but really well. When laid flat, the unstretched waistband measures 14.5&#34; and 19&#34; when fully stretched. On the side, the shorts measure 13&#34; from the top of the waistband to the bottom of the leg opening.<br /><br />The shorts are made from a double layer of poly material and come fully lined. About those pockets... The pockets are very shallow and are really there for looks. I'm not sure I'd trust a set of keys to stay put in one of the pockets and there's no way the average phone would fit. Still, the contrasting edge on the pockets is a nice detail, even if they are only for show.<br /><br />In many ways, the cut and style of these shorts is a throwback to the good old days when athletic shorts were exactly that - short. They're trim and flexible enough to look perfectly at home running up and down on an athletic field and the inside seams are smooth enough to wear while jogging. Enjoy!"
5.0,I loved this bracelet the second I opened it. Its in great condition and very pretty. It is a little big on my wrist but its alright
5.0,My daughter loves these stick on earrings.  They are cute and have stayed on well.
5.0,Great bag carried it all over France
5.0,Fit great. Not too tight
5.0,They are comfortable and do the grip job. My husband loves them.
5.0,"Comfy, cute, and stylish."
5.0,Very comfortable nice looking slippers. I have not washed them yet but they do seem like they would hold up fine as they are nice quality.
5.0,"Great quality set for any aged man. My son gave this as a Christmas gift  for his uncle, heck I will order a set for myself. Excellent price too."
5.0,These are a wonderful addition to any woman’s accessory library!
5.0,"Nice and compact. Aller than I expected, but that is good."
5.0,"This headgear rivals the expensive brands that were very prevalent along the trail. I never used the front sunblocking ""bandit"" attachment, but had it in case the sun got too much. Good venting, double wall airspace bill, nice long panels, good graytone color, not too bright. Buy it."
5.0,Cute and good weight. Solid piece of jewelry
5.0,Gteat! Fast delivery
5.0,Was perfect!!! Loved this dress for Halloween.
5.0,"Granddaughter loved it.... so I loved it.... she wished it would have come with hat, but they were going to Disney the next week.... so they were able to find hat at Epcot...."
5.0,"I Have a A/B Cup from Working Out & Love These Little Sexy Bralettes For Daily Comfy Wear n For Sleep with the Perfect Amount of Support. I’m 5 ft Size 0 in Clothes Tiny Person & These Run SMALL! I wear the Size XS in Everything, but Am Happy with These in a Size Medium especially after Washing. I Have About a 28-30 inch bust very Petite in Usual Bras So I Recommend ordering a Size Larger For Sure When Buying & Don’t Recommend To A Bigger Chest Size (Above A/B) As They Don’t Have Much Support as in I wouldn’t Wear Them Working Out, but They’re Sweet for Daily Casual Wear, Great Price, Very Comfy & Adorable especially for petite Women like me"
5.0,Really handy wallet. I bought it to keep all my cards and bus pass in one place along with some bills. Also it can be attached to my keychain so I can grab my keys and wallet all at once when stepping out. Have been using it for a month now and it’s as good as new. Loved it

5.0,"Beautiful  turquoise earrings, and well made. Comfortable to wear."
5.0,Love the soft feel and adjustable straps.  Very comfortable and just enough support for the purpose.
5.0,"So cute for a newborn photo shoot! My baby hates being naked, and as soon as I put this on he was instantly comforted.  It was a little small on him but he is a long baby and 6 weeks old.  I can't wait to get the pictures back, he looked so sweet in this.  Definitely good for photo shoots."
5.0,Very nice dress! Lots of compliments all night! The  cleavage is a little low fyi
5.0,I love the pendant! The style is unique . Absolutely gorgeous!  I recommend this item 100 percent.

5.0,"Really cute and comfy, especially the pastel pink one"
5.0,"nice, great for guys"
5.0,This stays on throughout the whole night...
5.0,"I love this dress!!! The ruffle detailing is so pretty and flirty! I am 5’7 and normally wear a 16 or 18, so I was nervous that this dress only came in an XL. But LISTEN! It hugged and curved exactly where it needed to (with the help of a body shaper of course 😉).  As a woman with a big ole booty, I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t ride up too far in the back! The material is breathable but thick! It feels way more expensive than $24. I’m so happy I went with this dress!"
5.0,Great slippers. Comfy and keep my feet warm.
5.0,Love them... Great price
5.0,Just right in every way.
5.0,Ordered for a trip to Europe in October.  They look great.  Nice material with some mesh so you can see what is inside.  They are just what I was hoping for.
5.0,Earrings are very cheaply made but cute for the price. The size of the flower is as pictured on model. The backs were bend but were easy to bend back into place.
5.0,"Used this dress in my Marie Antoinette costume and could not believe the quality! It's absolutely stunning, and I got compliments all night. Make sure to wear with a pannier underneath so you get the accurate silhouette. The fabric was super luxe to the touch, and the lace was very pretty. Super impressed!"
5.0,The hat is super cute and very well made!  I get lots of compliments on it.  It even can pull down over my ears in cold weather and the visor is great for sunny days.
5.0,Great camouflage pattern
5.0,"Solo un poco larga para mi estatura de 5'3"". Apenas y se pueden ver mos zapatos. Pero buena tela, me encantó apesar de lo largo."
5.0,It's a nice large face watch. I have 3 of these different colors. The watch had held up great.

5.0,It fit like it said
5.0,THIS IS SO CUTE!! I got this as part of a Christmas present for a great friend and we both LOVE BTS!! I can't wait for her to see :3
5.0,Perfect bag for the mushroom hunt...
5.0,The green band with black clasp is really nice - very good green color. Makes my 1980's calculator nerd watch look cool again- lol. The packaging from this company is top-notch- includes replacement pins and installation tool in case you don't want to use the quick release ones.
5.0,I love this watch. The link removal tool worked perfectly and the watch fits great. The orange accent makes this great for either formal or casual wear.
5.0,"I have been searching for something exactly like this for quite some time. Must have been googling using the wrong terms because this is it. I have not worn this yet but have tried it on a few times. Right out of the package it was super wrinkled and shorter than I hoped it would be but my husband liked it on me. I steamed the wrinkles out and it’s longer and much cuter. We both like it now. Love the sleeves, the top fits fine (I don’t have much on top) and the waist is good although on me it is a tad short waisted but not enough to be an issue. The decorative string ties are a take it or leave it for me - no purpose and another reviewer noted they could be easily removed, no skill required for that.  As I said, I haven’t worn this yet so am wondering if it will wrinkle a lot while being worn or if packed. Will try to remember to update if they wrinkle a lot."
5.0,Nice warm sock that is not too bulky to wear with boots.
5.0,The Bluetooth link makes is easy to set alarm and timer from your phone. You can also see how much battery is one the watch from the phone app.<br /><br />It’s also very comfortable to wear. Very light.<br /><br />The dive feature is good to. Timing your dives and surface interval. The large face also makes it very easy to read.
5.0,"These plugs are lovely; The picture is on the front and has a glass covering over it, giving it a snowglobe-like appearance. On the back, it is solid black with the same glass covering. The earrings are double flared, so make sure that your ears are stretched to 7/16 for a couple weeks before trying to put them in!"
5.0,I would definitely order these again!
5.0,Beautifully 👍
5.0,"I would recommend these du-rags 100% seam is on the outside and the inside is silk, so you can actually save progress while wearing the du-rag for style"
5.0,"it is comfortable to wear this mask while walking outside or in the other public areas. I feel breathable, and it does not fog up my eye glasses."
5.0,better than the pictures. It was a pleasant surprise
5.0,"This jacket looks great and fits great. It is not a warm jacket at all. It's more of a fashion jacket. I would have preferred the color of the jacket to be a bit darker, but it still looks good. Alfani jackets are one of my favorites as far as looks go."
5.0,Super cute and the material is really nice! It’s soft and comfortable :)
5.0,Comfortable material and hasn’t faded with washing
5.0,I recently purchased a Mel Blount signed jersey and was looking for a display case for my Steelers Cave. This is an excellent product. I love it and am going to buy another when I purchase my next jersey (Rocky Bleier's jersey) in the near future.
5.0,I am very satisfied with the way the watch bands feel and fit the watch.
5.0,"Absolutely love this dress! The skirt section is made of a nice thick material. The upper section is a little thinner than the bottom, so I'm definitely wearing only a nude bra with this. Love the design and the fit:)"
5.0,Great fit for full hair coverage and a fun print. I like that there is a built in sweat band
5.0,I bought these for my husband. Every single time he wears them he is thanking me for buying them.
5.0,Held up in s wash and dry cycle lol. Good quality
5.0,Fast delivery. Thank you. Bigger ball than I expected

5.0,U get what you pay for literally not a bad buy for some Amazon grills
5.0,I love all of these earrings. I get tons of compliments when I wear them.
5.0,Great quality.  Quick shipping!
5.0,"Wonderful watch.  Basic, but accurate and does what I need.  This is my beater watch - I usually us it in the gym as a stopwatch so I can keep track of my time between sets.  Only 10 bucks so I won't be too broken up about it if the thing breaks.  However, it seems pretty tough for a 10 dollar watch.  It's also low profile so it doesn't get in the way.  The numbers, etc. are really easy to read and the light is a nice touch.  Great for basic functions.  Remember - this is more &#34;classically&#34; sized - so it might be smaller than you think.  I personally don't mind as some watches these days seem way too big.  I also have small wrists so it works well.  Recommended highly."
5.0,"Feels so nice! Smooth cups, and slimming! Great material! Arrived fast too!"
5.0,Good quality and very cute with the rhinestones.
5.0,"The dress ia beautiful but the neck is too tight and around the bust area is too big, i had to take it to get alterations done at yhe neck and bust area, but everything is what it looks like in photo."
5.0,Very comfy linen pant.
5.0,"Amazing romper! Can easily be dressed up or dressed down. I usually like a looser fit when wearing a romper. I’m around 130 and got a large and it fit perfectly. The only thing is it does run a little short, so if your like me and like some extra room i would go up from your normal size. But LOVE it."
5.0,These are adorable and at a great price.  Super fast and amazingly nice package with a free gift.  I will definitely order from them again.
5.0,Watch came earlier than the estimated time.....my mom loves it very much....thanks again
5.0,fue un regalo para mi hermano dentista.
5.0,I love the way they feel and fit - can't wait to sleep in them.  They were shipped in a timely manner.
5.0,Bought this for my mother for Christmas 3 years ago and she wears it almost everyday. Goes with pretty much anything and has not gotten loose on her wrist at all. Great quality
5.0,"I lost the pairI bought from a local drug store a while ago and can't seem to find them in store anymore. These may not look as pretty, but they are super convenient. I can put them on, take them off or just flip them up any time with one hand, AND there's no need to take my glasses off. Don't understand why they don't carry them in store anymore. Delivery was prompt, no over or under packaging."
5.0,Fast shipping and perfect item
5.0,Fits perfectly even on my long torso! Follow the measurement guidelines and you won't have any issues.
5.0,Was skeptical about the size and replacing my daith piercing with these but they work. And I love the smaller size.
5.0,I bought this as s graduation gift for my niece. It's a great quality and exactly what she wanted.
5.0,My daughter loves these shoes. I think they may look good longer and scuff less than her previous shoes. We’ll see...
5.0,Fun earrings!
5.0,"Very bright & shiny necklaces. True to size. There were no marks identifying them as pure 925 sterling, but seem to be wearing well without any color change so far."
5.0,"I have several pair of these in the wide.  The cushion is great for awhile, then compresses.  But they are a great three season shoe for Texas.  Cute with leggings, dresses and jeans"
5.0,Got these for my dad to wear after ablation and he loves them. Wore them for weeks before even.
5.0,"VERY GOOD QUALITY, MERRY CHRISTMAS"
5.0,It is a gift for my best friend and I know she will love the way it looks. I bought because blue is her favorite color.
5.0,Gorgeous bracelet that I can add ginger snap jewels to fit any occasion or mood.  I really love these things!  Be aware however that it is for the larger ginger snap ornaments.
5.0,This rain jacket is very well made. I have the version without the hood. The outer material is brightly colored and the material is strong. The lining is rubbery but thin and flexible. It is for waterproofing. This jacket probably won’t be something you would wear for layering and warmth as the rubbery material won’t offer any ventilation. But I do understand that the purpose is as rain gear. All the zippers are of excellent quality. The size is about right as stated.
5.0,"Stylish, blocks out all rays any place, any time."
5.0,My daughter loves this mask (14 years old). She says it is the most comfortable mask we own.
5.0,I like that this shirt has a pretty floral print and fits as expected. It's also very soft and warm. The material is very comfortable and is also affordable.
5.0,Bought this to go to a Seahawks game where I needed to have a clear bag.  Worked great and held a lot of stuff!  Have only used a few times but has held up great.
5.0,Excellent for water walking.  I wore out my first pair after much use— this is a replacement.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:2a36f30a24cfdb493b61bf0c2a83e1b4]] The stainless steel is polished to perfection, the details are intricate and precise, and the size is true. Very beautiful ring, i would reccomend this 1000x to anyone! Its very one of a kind, never seen anything like it. Once again Jude Jewelers has impressed me. Hope the picture and video helps others who are deciding to buy it!"
5.0,Love these.  I can store chapstick and when I take the cap off it's not spun up all the way like when it's in my pocket.  Masculine bull logo is great too.
5.0,I bought this as a christmas gift for my aunt. She was looking for a green necklace. Seeing her face light up as she unwrapped this gift was great! She loved it!!
5.0,"Nice bracelet, gave to wife for Christmas."
5.0,"Elegant product, I am just loving it!"
5.0,This is the warmest thing for any type of extremely cold weather. It runs just a little small. It is perfect for kids or persons with a smaller head.
5.0,"I was specifically looking for boots that were made from a harder/thicker leather for the ankle support.  These definitely fit the bill!  They are very well constructed and offer the needed support.  There was no ""breaking in"" period with these at all.  They were instantly comfortable.  They also happen to be beautiful!!  LOVE THESE!  I'm going to look for them in other colors too!"
5.0,"Beautiful, simple and elegant."
5.0,Awesome great to work out in
5.0,"5'7"" 122lbs. Ordered a size small. It fits great. I often buy Athleta, the material is comparable but the price is a million times better. I will be purchasing more of these."
5.0,Very beautiful bracelet & I absolutely love the color
5.0,Bomb.com!!!
5.0,I have been searching for a heated vest and came across this one. After reading the reviews I can definitely say it was a really great investment! Not only does it keep me warm but it is definitely fast charging and super light weight. The heating levels are also fast acting and doesn’t take long for it to warm up. The material of the vest also feels sturdy and shows it will last me a long time! Great investment for keeping me warm on the job.
5.0,"They are a good fit for my premie son , He was 34 weeks so they have a long way for him to outgrow. They are thin but not cold thin. They do keep in the heat without making his head sweat."
5.0,It is holding my motorcycle pants where they are supposed to while looking spiffy. Nuf said!
5.0,"Great, just what I was looking for. I am size 8 or 10 and the X-Large fit fine."
5.0,So comfy!!! Got these because of the folded waist band!! For some reason this style is becoming hard to find with everyone doing high rise. Which after a child I find to be so uncomfortable. These were perfect!!
5.0,Very nice earrings. Fit to size. Very cool. Nice quality and fast shipping !
5.0,My husband got as a Father's Day gift loved them and well worth the money.
5.0,Print is perfect size for my face.  It's nice and light. Love it
5.0,Very nice quality...I did have to alter it a bit
5.0,Exact to description/pic.
5.0,exactly what i wanted! they all look great and there is a lot of sizes.
5.0,Fit nice and snug. It folds up well also. It was a windy day the first time I used it and it didn’t fly off or anything. It seems like it has some VERY thin wire all around the hat. So it makes it easy to flip up the brim if need be. It’s pretty nice!
5.0,This extension works perfectly on my sons glasses. he is 7 year old and have small glasses. IT completely covered the original glass and doesn't look big on his face. SO anyone looking this for their kids can definitely try.
5.0,These look dressy and are warm for winter weather.
5.0,I absolutely LOVE this beautiful necklace❣️<br />It is made very well. I've had so many compliments. The beautiful stones are inlayed separately in their own settings Just Stunning!
5.0,"Excellent Quality, and it is very nice addition that they sent a tool to be install. !"
5.0,Good quality and good size lots of space for items. Lots of pockets.
5.0,"Thick material. Great pattern that doesn’t warp/change when stretched.  I ordered a Large. I’m 5’8” 170 lbs. Measurements 40-33-41. Fits just right. If you are any taller, go up. This is snug but perfect for me."
5.0,Very strong durable well made belt
5.0,Spanish teacher loved it
5.0,I bought these shirts for maternity wear and absolutely loved them! Super soft and comfrotable. The slide slits are super cute; especially with my growing belly. The great thing is that I can now wear them post-partum as well. Love these!
5.0,"One thing I liked about this product is that its adjustable, because the flaps stretch out. It really does help out with the durag/wavecap marks on your forehead. Before this product, sometimes I would wear two or even three durags for extra compression and afterwards the forehead marks were clearly visible. The compression on this product I would say is good as well. Personally, I would recommend getting a couple of these. I bought the purple by accident and I'm not purple kind of guy, but I don't really wear this overtly in public so it's okay.  All in all I will still wear durags, but the number of durags I have will decrease to about two. My formula will be one durag + one du-strap. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Will I buy more? Yes I will."
5.0,I love this dress so much I just ordered it in 4 other colors. It's short but great for summer and with leggings in the fall. I am 5'5 155 lbs 36 DD and ordered a large. It flares out to hide mommy pooch. Lightweight and so comfortable I almost feel naked. Great dress for the price!
5.0,Enjoying my purchase however no point to the date as it’s so tiny cannot read it.
5.0,I absolutely loved this dress.  It brings shows off all of your curves!
5.0,This is a perfect sized cross body purse. The pockets and zippers are perfect. The color is exactly what I hoped for. Price would have been double anywhere else for the same quality.
5.0,"This jumpsuit is just as pictured and perfect, perfect!  First, I would definitely order up a size....I normally wear a Small, but ordered a Medium based on other reviews and am so glad I did as it fits like a glove.  I was able to sit down comfortably in it and also dance for a couple of hours with no problem.  I also love the way this suit flows when you shimmy or twirl in it...the fringe is awesome.  I did have to be very careful when zipping it up as the fringe could easily get caught in it.  I also would recommend trying it on beforehand with whatever shoes you wear.  I'm 5'6"" with long legs, wore 5"" heels and the fringe would have still been dragging on the floor had I not cut beforehand.  Other than that...beautiful!  Thinking of ordering in another color, that is just how pleased I am with this purchase.  Thanks."
5.0,"Excellent item, for the price I was not sure but it is worth it. It looks like $50 bracelet."
5.0,Super cute braclet! I absolutely love this bracelet. The color is great and it goes well with everything.
5.0,"Highly recommend,  worked great for kids during allstars!"
5.0,"I wasn't expecting much, so I was very surprised at how great it looked and felt on. The fit and cut are very flattering and the stretch in the material gives it plenty roomy to not feel confined in. I love the necklace that it comes with, but I also appreciate the fact that it very easily comes off in case I want to wear a different and also in order to wash the dress. All in all, I highly recommend it... 5 full stars from me :)"
5.0,"very cute, but runs one size too big. I'm a size 14 and always purchase a size XXL on Amazon for all my clothes. This time, it ran to big. It's OK, I'd rather something too big than too small. My mother will make this fit me. Very cute and elegant top. Does not look cheap, but very soft."
5.0,"I own several Grace Karin dresses in different styles, and they never disappoint. The material is very stretchy, which is great since I’ve got a few extra quarantine pounds that I’m still trying to get rid of. It’s comfortable to sit and move around in, and I can’t wait to wear it to an event this summer."
5.0,"My favourite snow gloves I like them a lot, very comfortable and so soft and worm.They are waterproof and by the way so cute, the best gloves."
5.0,Shirt is adorable and comfy. Not baggy is fitted. Will buy more shirts from them in the future.
5.0,So I found out I couldn't wear the silicone band very tight as I apparently have a mild silicone reaction and get a red rash from the band. My solution was to loosen the band but the sensor wasn't making good contact. Picked this nylon band up and it's chunky matches the watch. It's very stiff right out for the bag but I expect it to loosen up over time. I received hex head tools that fit the watch screws and the change out only took about 2 minutes.
5.0,This is organizer is Perfect for my Neverfull MM! Fits all my beautiful items amazingly well. I love that it’s pink as well. It’s very important to have organication I’m your bag-“you never want that black hole -where you can’t find anything” I’m very happy with this purchase!
5.0,"Love these shoes, fit like a glove and they're beautiful as well."
5.0,They didnt last long
5.0,Beautiful bracelet!  High quality with fast shipping. Thank you so much!!

5.0,loved them
5.0,This is a super cute and comfy tennis skirt! You can wear it with pretty much anything! It breathers and is lightweight but not see through at all!
5.0,Purchased as a gift for christmas. Very nice
5.0,This is a beautiful dress and very comfortable.
5.0,Adorable shirt for little boys. Second purchase. Outgrew first shirt and he loved it so much I bought it again in size up.
5.0,My mom is going to love this!!
5.0,Fit is a little wide but she is a very slender girl
5.0,Perfect for a photo session
5.0,I wish they came in red
5.0,I was looking for some socks I could use to make a St. Patrick’s Day gnome.  I think these will work for my needs.
5.0,The double pins keeps it from moving
5.0,Obsessed with this dress. It's so cute and comfy and has adjustable straps so you can wear it with heels or flats. I'm 5'4 and can adjust to fit both. Love love love. Definitely going to order in more colors.
5.0,"This product is everything I would of hoped for. It arrived on time, was a fantastic price, it fits great and looks beautiful. I will definitely be buying more colors from this supplier."
5.0,"The dress came in, fit better than expected. I feel great in it! However I think the seller also sells cat nip because I swear my cats went bananas on me and the bag the dress came In. They won’t get off of me!!!"
5.0,So fun! We use these for our photo booth.
5.0,"Scrunchies, puka shells, bracelets, and stickers ...what more could a tween/teen girl ask for?!?<br /><br />My daughters, ages 8 and 13, love this VSCO girl set!  The necklace is adjustable and has an easy to open knot clasp.  The bracelets look like the name brand equivalent and are well-made.  The scrunchies are made of velvety fabric and offer a few fun colors.  The stickers work well on my daughters' school binders and on their water bottles as well.<br /><br />This kit makes a fabulous gift for the hard-to-buy-for tween and is a reasonable price for all that you get."
5.0,Beautiful! I get compliments when I ware them
5.0,Great shirt.  Need more for sure.
5.0,The color was perfect fitted to a tea and will order again
5.0,Very pretty top! Comfortable.
5.0,Love the packaging & the product.
5.0,Very cute and classy! Great detail in design.
5.0,Very nice quality love it
5.0,Cute top!  i'm a medium and bought the large. Glad I did. Fits exactly as I had hoped.
5.0,"It's good for what it is, and supporting LEOs, but the filter pocket is annoying. I ended up cutting it out. I had a hard time breathing through it even without a filter. It fits a little snug on me and I don't have the biggest head or neck. I'm considering cutting it on the seams and using it more like a true bandana than a neck sock thing. The colors were great, and that was my main concern."
5.0,Comfy runs true to size perfect for walking ...
5.0,Very nice size and weight!
5.0,Looks good and like the blouses<br />The material could be better
5.0,"I love this necklace.  It doesn't have that plastic, cheap, look that most floral necklaces seem to have.  It goes great with so many things, and really dresses up plain neckline.  I would definitely buy this again."
5.0,"Arrived really fast, and they were perfect :)"
5.0,I love the fact that I can now wear my bras longer and be comfortable
5.0,Love these earrings.  And they don’t bother my ears. I’m allergic to nickel.
5.0,I bought these when my KOS silicone plugs fell apart. I had those for 10 years and I wasn't sure how these would hold up considering those were $20 for the pair and these are significantly cheaper. I have to say I'm surprised at the quality. The colors on some are a little translucent and kind of fade into my ear; I can't really see they grey ones when I wear them. But I adore the rainbow pair and wear them all the time. The other colors are nice as well and I like that there's a variety so I can match them with what I'm wearing. I bought the 0g pack and they fit nice.
5.0,It was a lovely gift.
5.0,Love them while I work!!
5.0,"This is great.  No falling all over the place , just stays put when I’m walking my dogs. Cute too"
5.0,The swimsuit is true to size and this one is pretty cute! It is actually pretty slimming and flattering. The design is cute too. It isn't too thick and not too thin to where you can see underneath it. It is pretty breathable and lightweight. I received this item for free or for a discounted price
5.0,The size is perfect
5.0,"These are great!!! I’m 57 and have a narrower face that looks ridiculous in all the oversized adult sunglasses out now days! Went on Amazon to find sunglasses for my Grandkids (3 to 14 yrs old) and saw a review with pictures of a beautiful dark haired  adult gal wearing these (thanks by the way) so I ordered 2 different colors for myself... perfect :) , good sun protection and price really right!!"
5.0,Great dress.  I got the grey medium and it fit my 5'3&#34; 145 lbs frame perfectly.  The material is stretchy and easy to iron.
5.0,"The colors are too bright, but the quality is nice"
5.0,Feel great.  Work wonderful in my wifes yoga class
5.0,"I love this blouse. V neck is very flattering, fabric is smooth and flows over your body. It's a denim blue color so I wear it with matching skinny jeans and boots. Can be worn almost all year because it's cool even with sleeves.<br />Feminine western is so pretty.!"
5.0,cutest decoration ever!
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my daughter and I loved it so much I then purchased one for myself.  Great product and love that it comes in so many different sizes.
5.0,"This dress is awesome!  I don't usually wear long sleeve dress but I had a December event. SOO GLAD I bought this.  I'm a little under 5' , I ordered a small and it fit like it was made for me. The length was perfect & the dress is sexy.  The material was super soft."

5.0,"items comes well package, both lenses arrive intact. really eady to install and it helps a lot not carrying two pair of glasses. this clip on lenses were really easy to install and it help with sun, since i need my glasses to read i can just lift this clip on an use my glasses ad normal, when step outside just pull down the lense. great quality and really nice view when in use.."
5.0,So cute! I wear it with a knot at the bottom but it can be worn many different ways. It is fairly thick so keep that in mind when ordering. It looks great with my black and white boho shirt and it doesn't pinch the skin when worn.

5.0,"Got these for our daughter's wedding.  Clips are sturdy and hold tightly.  That was my most major concern, whether they would pull off of the pants. The leather portions do look cheaper, but for the price and the suspenders being under the coat...they were just fine."

5.0,"Cut well, this shirt elegantly hides a wee pot belly while flattering the waist. The neckline is a tad to high for my liking, but if you don’t mind high crew-neck... Excellent shirt to wear with a showy necklace!"
5.0,"Worth the money we paid for. Giving it as a gift. Seems sturdy but, we'll see. :)"

5.0,I checked with a meter and this cap blocks at least 90% Better than others that Intested.
5.0,"They came a day early which was dope! Opened them up, packaged nicely with a string bag. Thought they looked a little long, but after putting them in, they are perfect. Screw on easily, and don’t appear to come unscrewed easily. Only day one, but so far I’d highly recommend. Not heavy on the lobes either. 0 gauge / 8mm is what I got, and what is pictured, sorry the pic is upside down."
5.0,These biking underwear fit and perform exactly as advertised. Delivery was very prompt and I am enjoying these shorts. I am very satisfied with the product. My wife purchased a different brand so we could compare. I believe the Spotti outperform in both fit and comfort.
5.0,My husband loved the shirt<br />Looks really nice on and dresse
5.0,Prefect size and not heavy on the ear.
5.0,Looks good and a nice price
5.0,Needed a lightweight and compact cot for motorcycle camping.  These look well made and big enough for me.  I am 5'8&#34; and weigh about 165 ibs.  I did not hear any of the creaking that some reviews stated.  I have not use them yet but looking forward to using them in my upcoming trip.  Easy to put together and easy to take apart.
5.0,"Seriously in love. I wear a size 9 pant, and a medium top, so I ordered my typical medium and it fits great. The top is just short enough to show my belly a tiny bit which is super cute."
5.0,"Love these shades, everyone is intrigued by then and mirror look is great."
5.0,real drawstring!
5.0,I love this hat!  And it has a zipper to remove the crown so you can also wear it as a sun visor.  This is a great bargain for the money.  I just wish it came in  ore colors.
5.0,Holds all my cards in one place
5.0,Amazingly cute! Just loved it :)
5.0,High quality. Comes with a case and cleaning cloth. They look very high end.
5.0,My son has very sensitive ears and would run away every time loud noises were involved. Haveing these ear muffs has really extended are wood working time. And he no longer heads for the hills when I start my motorcycle or lawn mower. He may look funny playing in the yard with head phones on but who care because they keep him safe and comfortable.
5.0,I love this dress.  It fits true to size.  I love the pockets.  The colors were deep and not faded even after washing.  Washed perfect!
5.0,"Like pant very much, bought 2 more pairs moo loop p<br />Loop mui"
5.0,GREAT SHIRT...I no longer have to wring out my shirts from sweating in the sun.
5.0,FINALLY FOUND ONE WITH ENOUGH GROIN ROOM. TWO POCKETS WITH ZIPPER.<br /><br />QUALITY LOOKS GOOD.<br /><br />JUST ORDERED FOUR MORE.
5.0,THis dress is comfortable and I get a lot of complements in it.
5.0,"This is one of the most flattering dresses I've ever owned. I bought it for a Minni Mouse costume and it fits amazingly. My waist looks tiny and it hits right at the knees for me (I'm 5'10&#34;). I purchased a petty coat to go with it and I'm so happy I did, it fills out the skirt perfectly."
5.0,"I have a pair from another company that is basically a size 11.5 in women's. I take anywhere between a 10-11 (depends on width, since I have wide feet), and the pair I already have fits a bit loose. Not bad, just obviously larger than I would normally wear. So when I was selecting a size from this company, I decided to go with the 11. I thought that since they are a rubbery slip on shoe, having it still be a little loose would be a good thing. I am so glad I went with the 11, because they just fit. It is weird, if I press on the toe area, there is a little space, but the opening and width definitely feel smaller. It's just a little more narrow- form fitting. But not outside the realm of that size.<br /><br />That being said, they still fit. There is enough give for my wide feet to fit. I prefer the looser fit, so I may order another from this company to truly see how it compares to the other company whose shoes I like. They don't offer solid black, and this company does.<br /><br />This style shoe looks goofy, but they are surprisingly comfortable. There is more support than expected. I like that the heels can be stepped on/flattened out and worn as a slip on clog. I wear them mostly around the house, to take my dogs out to play, and now I am so used to putting them on, I wear them to run errands. They are comfortable enough and supportive enough to be able to do that. I am not going for a hike in them, but daily wear is good. More comfortable than my super basic canvas tennis shoe! I have yet to need to get them wet, so I don't know how they do as a water shoe."
5.0,Quedaron lindos
5.0,Love these! You do not suffocate and they don’t fall off your nose or fog up your glasses! Bought more!
5.0,As good as appears in the photo. My little boy loved them !
5.0,"They are so soft and fit great. People love them and ask about them often! I typically wear a large, but wear a medium in Beyond Yoga leggings."
5.0,"It's a nice watch so far.  I have purchased so many and the battery dies within months, the wrist band slides around, etc.  This is a nice leather strap, has a minute hand which trips me up on occasion  but it's stylish and I like it."
5.0,Gave to my boyfriend as a Christmas gift! He loved it! Vibrant colors and details on short! Would def recommend!
5.0,"Buen material y  calidad , se adapta a varias edades tal como lo describe el producto."

5.0,"A piece of incredible beauty. The photo does not do the piece justice. The workmanship, engraving is awe inspiring. Amber is a stone that I have associated with the peace and harmony, I truly love this piece.<br />As it came from Cornwall, it arrived earlier than expected, a delight.<br />I am looking forward to wearing this piece for many occasions.<br />Thank you to the artist."
5.0,"I bought this for my 5 year old niece as a gift and she loved it. I was expecting to need to buy a new chain for it, but the chain is actually good quality. The locket is about the size of my thumbnail and &#34;locks&#34; well. The hinge seems to be pretty solid, too. The finish is not &#34;cheap&#34; and it came packaged well."
5.0,"I am 5'5"" and 115 pounds.  This dress fit me perfectly.  So soft and comfortable."

5.0,Fit as expected. I really like the feel of the material. Very soft.
5.0,I was a little hesitant on buying these since they had no reviews but I’m glad I did. They came well packaged and weren’t squished or bent out of shape like I’ve seen on so many others. The black was nice and vibrant and there was not a single one I wasn’t able to use.
5.0,"They feel so comfy and really isolating. I used to buy such underwear in the cheap stores, off the street.. Not only it cost the same, you get something that feels like major league vs highschool team.<br />Insulation wise, I live in NYC metro area and these are more than adequate for our winters."
5.0,"Perfect fit, perfect quality."
5.0,This is my favorite mask I wear glasses and it is so easy to breathe in here and my glasses do not get fogged up with this mask.
5.0,Such a cute well made dress
5.0,"Fits perfect , true to size<br />Comfortable, my favorite new workout shirts!"
5.0,"Comfortable, light weight, awesome eye cover, and excellent price and quality liked them a lot"
5.0,"This is a good product love all the colors the sizing is a little off for me. I'm 5'4, 130 pounds i usually fit a S in clothes, but it was too tight so i exchanged it for a M but it was still tight on the waist area butt and hips.. So exchanged for a L. I was bummed the L was HUGE all over. So I returned it. And just stuck with the M. The M and S fit simular in the shoulders and chest area."
5.0,I like it but not what I expected
5.0,Exactly the way I expected. No complains
5.0,Adorable warm spring colored socks!
5.0,Everyone loves this mask. Get used to people laughing and telling you that mask is great. Kids don't really care for it but i think that's all masks. If you deal with the public and your out going you'll love this mask. It makes people happy.
5.0,I use this bag for work! Durable and roomy!
5.0,These fit great and worked perfect for my homemade Pennywise Halloween costume.
5.0,"My wife bought me a few of these as a gift, it's to warm for my gator neck and a lot cheaper then a bat wing. After 1000 miles they're still doing the job and the large size let's me fold it over but still tie a knot to keep it in place at highway speed."
5.0,These slippers are so warm and cozy! I was really surprised by how amazing they felt on my feet. Like little warm soft fluffy clouds! They fit pretty true to size and the quality is really good and the bottoms are anti skid. These will be amazing in winter!
5.0,"As a tall and lean American man, it is next to impossible to find clothes that fit. This is a slim fitting sweatshirt and it is perfect! I love the look and appears to be well made. I normally wear a L, but went XL (knowing Europeans aren't as hefty as Americans) to make sure the sleeves would be long enough. I'm delighted with this purchase."
5.0,I love everything! Very stylish and very beautiful
5.0,"The waistband is everything!!!! I’m in love with the thicker style and yet it’s not overly compressive. Being 5 months pregnant I need looser coverage but still want it to be flattering. I sized up a little (I’m usually between a large and XL). Also the material is heavenly, so light waist and stretches with you everywhere."
5.0,Fits perfect and I love the colors and design
5.0,"Love this bag.  I have a &#34;handbag addiction&#34; and have too many to say out loud without feeling embarrassed.  I cover all styles from high end Louis Vuitton and Gucci to Calvin Klein to off brands like this manufacturer.  This bag is a keeper!  It's got plenty of room, fits perfect on the shoulder drop in that the handle flows free...no interference to get into the bag and has great organization.  Leather is soft and the stitching shows great detail.  The braided handles add just enough extra and the hardware is very durable."
5.0,Excellant
5.0,"Absolutely as described.<br />Tested them on a (very) long haul airplane trip...complete control of swelling.<br />Best if put on lying flat with legs in the area, thus allowing blood to return from the periphery."
5.0,"Fit exactly as expected.  You can make it longer or shorter using the drawstrings.  Paired with over the knee boots (also from Amazon).  This is my new favorite dress!!!  For reference, I am 5""5' and weigh 125 lbs.  I bought the size small and it was a perfect fit.  Such a flattering dress."
5.0,"This shirt was a gift for a friend that lives in NC and is a Duke fan.  He has a good sense of humor but I am glad I purchased this in my size.  He gave back his gift, (the Nerve of some people ;)).  It does fit a little snug but it is a great shirt for me to show my hate towards a certain player from the past..."
5.0,Super cute !! Fits perfectly!!
5.0,..and I love it. I thought there was no way this type of bra would work for me but I followed the chart and ordered the right size (dd/e)..works perfectly. Comfortable all day long. I will reorder.
5.0,"This is a beautiful ring !!! My ring size is 4 and its very very difficult to get rings that size.<br />But this ring is very pretty, the size is exact. I'm very happy with it. I'll definitely buy more designs from them if they have a size 4 !"
5.0,I love the robe
5.0,The socks were super soft and well made. Not cheap hot and scratchy. Fit my 9 yr old perfect!
5.0,Love the tool included that makes it so easy to remove links. The Band is Beautiful !
5.0,"The sandals are already helping spread my toes that have been curling under each other ever more over the last few years. A note that came with the sandals recommended wearing them only an hour or two per day at first to get used to them, but I have worn them most of the day every day but one since they arrived a week ago with no discomfort. For that I credit 1) the cupped heel, 2) the built-in arch support, 3) the built-in metatarsal support, 4) the soft dividers between the toes, and 5) the soft padding under the strap that also wraps just around the edges of the strap.<br /><br />On the days I wore the sandals most of the day, my toes were still relatively straight when I got up the next morning. On the day I did not wear the sandals at all my toes were curled under each other the next morning.<br /><br />Another nice feature is that you cannot easily walk out of these like many other sandals.<br /><br />I wear a size 13 in a sandal and a 14 in a street shoe with socks. I ordered size 13 and they fit perfectly."
5.0,Very pretty!!!! It took over a month to receive!!! Worth waiting!!!
5.0,"Got this for my teen son who had a much cheaper version on his Christmas wishlist. 100% worth the money, beautiful in blackwatch. Looks so much better on than pictured, too. NOT soft, so don't expect that. It's quality wool."
5.0,These pants exceeded my expectations. Beautifully made and yes they are organic. I'm short 5'2 and I can wear flats with these pants.
5.0,"Nicely made, good quality great price."
5.0,Wallet showed up on time and the quality was good.  My nephew loves it!
5.0,This skirt is very stretchy. It is also very form fitting so make sure you don't get a size too small. Unless you want to show off your booty!
5.0,Great alternative to the the pricy watch bands that apple sells.
5.0,Darling little necklace at such a reasonable price!  My granddaughter has not taken it off!
5.0,This bow tie looked fabulous on my fiancé.  He wore it well. I would definitely by another one. I was very nice for the price.
5.0,"I don't carry a big purse anymore, so I have just started buying wristlets in different colors, etc. and I switch them out all the time.  I now have two from Old Shanghai, and I bought another one for a friend because she was coveting this dandelion one.  They are so cute, and they do not look inexpensive, even though they are!  They have held up much better than some more expensive brands I have bought in the past.  I'm sure I'll be purchasing more in the future."
5.0,Adorable outfit! The colors are really nice and vibrant. It says to hand wash the outfit but I machine washed it in cold on delicate and it washed up very nicely. Would recommend. True to size
5.0,"Now, I don't normally write reviews, but this strap is just phenomenal! Strap is well constructed, excellent stitch finished, and the leather although it is alligator print, looks amazingly close to actual alligator leather. Needless to say, I am impressed for the quality at this price!"
5.0,Pants were very comfortable. Liked them so much ordered another pair
5.0,Liked glass lenses most. Styling is really nice and durable.
5.0,These cute little studs fit perfectly and sit flush to my ear. The product is exactly as shown. They're not too big and not too small so I can wear another pair of earrings in my second hole. The transaction was quick and I would definitely but form this seller again.
5.0,I usually wear size large. I ordered xtra large because of reviews. I’m glad cause it fits good. Love the shirt and so do others. Very cool
5.0,Really well built watch with lots of cool features.  The solar charging works great with just a minimum of sun exposure per day.  The watch updates the time accurately at least once every day.  All other measurements appear to be accurate.  The watch face is really visible and clear and the night lighting is extremely easy to use.
5.0,I bought these socks BEST pair of socks ever. They are very comfortable and fit perfectly well worth with the price. I highly recommend them to anyone
5.0,I purchased this dress for my upcoming cruise. I was very happy with the material and colors. The dress fit perfect. I am 5'7 and 160. My only concern is that I hope the belt will look okay as mine doesn't seem as wide as the picture shows. But it still looks great and I am very happy with it. I can always add my wide own belt. IT HAS POCKETS......YOU CAN'T GO WRONG! I would definitely recommend this dress and will most likely purchase another one.
5.0,"There's absolutely NOTHING I didn't like bout th iui s belly ring. It fit the theme of my state of Texas. Goldtone horse belly ring has a slight ""weight"" to it that you know it's there but not heavy. Super cute and it so my favorite."

5.0,These are alot better in person then on the website. The website does not do these justice!  There are two pair in this set: silver and gold and that is just awesome! The price i thought it was for one but you get 2 pairs! What a steal! These looks like they would cost a ton of money when you wear them and are extremely shiny. they look really fancy and would be perfect for a formal dinner date!<br /><br />These came extremely well packed and super fast! these are perfect for any time! you will love these I know I did! The quality on these are really nice but your not paying $100's for a good pair. These are really affordable and look like you paid the big bucks! I received these at a discount rate in exchange for my unbiased honest review

5.0,Based on the sizing provided I ordered large in blue and the ivory colored sweater. These are awesome. Soft and long. Slimming. I could have ordered a medium and been fine but I like mine a little loose. These are not bulky or heavy. Very classy and pretty. For reference I’m 5’7 and 160 with 38d. Plenty of room for more. Very happy.
5.0,Very feminine and pretty
5.0,Comfortable and cool!
5.0,"Love this bag so much. My toddler has outgrown the diaper bag but I still need something to hold snacks, toys and an emergency set of clothes. This works wonderfully and is pretty much gender neutral so my husband can also use. It is very well made and has the right amount of pockets both inside and out. I love that it has side pockets which I use for sippy cups and water bottles. I highly recommend and may even buy a second one."
5.0,I absolutely love this product. The bands are great. I love the pattern and material.
5.0,Nice &#34;historic&#34; memory of New York City.
5.0,Beautiful shiny ring!
5.0,"I love it! It is comfortable and just the right thickness! I am a Nursing Student who constantly washes her hands, and the ring does not slide off with hand washing or sanitizing! Definitely worth purchasing! Remember to go a size up. I wear a size 7.5 ring, and ordered an 8. It’s perfect!"
5.0,"A very Good Detail, Color, Style & Decoration, representing an Egyptian Cobra Coil Bracelet.  THANK YOU Very, very Much, It really HELPED with the Egyptian ITEM&#34;S.  CPT SCOTT."
5.0,I needed a new bag as the strap on my old one broke. I saw thi one and bought it it’s just the right size and water proof.
5.0,These worked perfectly. Will definitely buy again
5.0,"My son ordered this, and he loves it, and wears it constantly.  I will admit that it is quite the eye catcher."
5.0,These are the best things next to slice bread
5.0,"Really stylish!  I wanted lighter weight tights for warm weather riding and while these aren’t super light, they do have technical fabric that should dry quickly.  Very cute pull on tights for every warm day and should make a good layering piece when it’s cooler."
5.0,I have never worn aviators before but the color of the lenses spoke to me. They are thing and light and have a good case and cloth. Awesome<br />Value for the money .. love them
5.0,Cute belt! Just enough bling to dress up a simple dress or jeans and a tee shirt!
5.0,fits my belt loops
5.0,"Easy Breezy Beautiful Covers You Girl! ... I’ll be blunt:  fits well with both the crotch and arm holes up high enough where they’re supposed to be (instead of the crotch being at your knees and the arm holes down to your waist) ... and the straps are adjustable for an even better torso fit ... Comfortable and flowy without looking like a sack ... I’d buy more if there were other colors (prints and solids) made the same exact way with the same material ... My fit info:  at 5’6” 190 lbs the XL is just right, even with some room to spare ... I’ll be wearing it for Thanksgiving with a chiffon poncho full of fall colors ... and then year-round with all sorts of other toppers/scarves/accessories ... or by itself during warmer weather ...... HEY DIDK!!! ... MAKE MORE!!!"
5.0,"Material is soft has the vintage tee feel, sizing is accurate. Arrived as expected."
5.0,"So far they have held up all summer, cant ask for too much more then that. Taken them out on the boat and they help with water glare and don't slide off my face. I am surprised that they are not 100% mirrored in the sense that if you look directly at me you can see my eyes so if I could I would take off half a star for that but the color is as vibrant as pictured so I still give it 5 stars."
5.0,"Such a cute romper! Fits as expected. I'm 5'4&#34;, 145, and the Medium fit great!"
5.0,"Great necklace!<br />This product took awhile to get here, but it was worth the wait. It is definitely a conversation piece.<br /><br />It seems to be made well."
5.0,"For the price, this is adorable. I love this keychain!"
5.0,Nice and cheap.  It works well for the price I paid.  I 'd order again.
5.0,"Sunglasses are not only fashionable, but they are durable. Delivery was fast and they are as advertised."
5.0,My mother asked for some earrings she loved them
5.0,Fit great<br />Looked great at the Halloween party
5.0,"Solid timely delivery and a great product, can’t go wrong"
5.0,Love all the earrings I wear them everyday
5.0,"I need one for each day of the week, two just won't do! These are amazingly soft and light...don't hesitate!  5ft.155lb. size Medium fit loose and perfect in length."
5.0,Beautiful shirt but it does run a little large.  Right length.
5.0,"These were very pretty, so sorry I lost one already. People would comment on these earring, worth the price."
5.0,Great for reading and working on the computer and a very good price. [[ASIN:B00T83L18K Foster Grant Magnivision Molly Readers Gold Metallic Bronze 1.50]]
5.0,Just as described!  My daughter loves them!  Satisfied!
5.0,My husband loves his new boots. He needed some boots that were soft and comfortable because he has some issues with his feet hurting and getting cold due to Chemo a few years ago. He loves them!
5.0,The color its good and also the size its fit.
5.0,These are thinner than my other yoga pants but still nice quality & very comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised for the price!
5.0,"I purchased two of these, one for myself and one for my son.  They work GREAT and I paid next to nothing for both of them.  Shipping was also free with my other items, so the deal was even sweeter."
5.0,"I am plus size and this is too small for me.  You are probably wondering why I would still give this five stars, but I can not take off a star since it did not fit me.  Besides that, I love it!<br /><br />This was so cute, and I was hoping since it was oversized that it would fit, but it was just a little too snug for me personally.  The colors are so vibrant and the pattern was also amazing.  I think this would actually make a really cute summer dress, so it does not only need to be used for a cover up.  I wish they would make them plus sized, as I would order more for sure.<br /><br />I gave this to my sister and she also loved it.  She has worn it as a cover up during the summer, but also feels it is cute and would wear it out for a fun night.<br /><br />I was sent this item for free in exchange for an honest review."
5.0,"Cute dress. Fits well, and the colors are vibrant."
5.0,This is just what I was looking for. Over the shoulder or cross the body. Has two sections. Looks small but very roomy. Made very well.
5.0,"These fit my 5 and two year old great since theycare adjustable.<br />Im was so bummed we lost the pink one on vacation, so I will be buying more!<br />These also dry pretty quickly which is a plus!"
5.0,"A loose and flowy dress that is so breezy and comfortable! I felt like I was wearing a super soft nightgown! The pockets are one of the best parts! Not form-fitting, but also doesn’t make you look like you’re wearing a potato sack. I love the pattern of the white flowers on the light blue dress! Definitely would recommend."
5.0,"Great price, love the variety of colors, product works perfectly.  Thank you.  Would buy again over more expensive items that did not work as well."
5.0,"I love it! I wear my new shirt for bed, and I will wake up with a smile on my face just like Princess Poppy."
5.0,Love this shirt!<br />Great material.<br />I ordered a large which would have fit as expected but I received an XL.<br />Luckily I like the over sized look also.
5.0,Cute sandals for a great price
5.0,Love the fit and lightweight. I’m buying these in so many colors.
5.0,fits great and looks very good.
5.0,Fits well and worth the money compared to name brand mk brands. A little hard to get on at first but after a few times installing and removing the straps the hardware loosens up.
5.0,this bracelet is gorgeous!!! i love it and it has the perfect symbol
5.0,I LOVE THIS DRESS!!! I wear it woth my white Air Force ones and it’s ADORABLE
5.0,Hey they are luggage tags.  I found my luggage so I guess im pretty happy.
5.0,It's a gift!
5.0,My dad loved this!
5.0,"I have worn Filson's nearly every day for the past two years. I have four sets now. You're not just buying the name but a quality product from a great company. I really appreciate the Tall option as I'm 6'-9&#34; and Filson's have all sorts of extra adjustment. And, they last! I'm wearing an original set today and they still do the job. If your jeans/pants don't come with suspender buttons, buy a good set and they apply easily."
5.0,it's a belt. it holds up my pants what more can I say
5.0,Beautiful frames. Will order again in a different color :)
5.0,Looks Amazing. Stretch band makes it wearable for different size wrists. Just not sure on its durability how long it will last.
5.0,Very pretty and comfortable once you get used to wearing them.  They were really uncomfortable the first day or two but now I forget they're even on.  I bought these to match a sterling silver moon necklace I bought and they work together beautifully.  Earrings stay in place once you adjust them to your ears.
5.0,Used for varicose veins.<br />Great 20/30 compression socks. The only negative is they are thick and will be too heavy to wear in the summer.
5.0,So comfortable! Great fit!
5.0,"Great goggles for my 9-year old daughter who is on a swim team. They are tough, attractive and do the job! Very pleased!"
5.0,"the fit is very nice, not too tight, and the material it is made with is very soft, so it feels very comfortable to wear."
5.0,It’s amazing
5.0,Well made it appears
5.0,Fabric is amazing quality! Would definitely buy more in different colors.
5.0,This hat is comfortable and nice quality.
5.0,Loved the fabric and fit
5.0,Love!!
5.0,My toddler has gotten many complements on these new shoes! He is currently a 10 in toddlers and they fit perfectly!
5.0,I feel like a wizard wearing these glasses. I can see everything in high detail. Great lenses. Very fine product.
5.0,I ordered these for my wife and she says they are very comfortable. I thought they were quite sexy and I like the high cut. They are very high cut as expected. Exactly what I wanted!
5.0,A great and snuggle fit.ove it
5.0,I had bad rash issues with the old band and now with this new one all is clear. skin seems to be breathing!
5.0,"I'm 5' 10"" and weigh 170lb, went from large to x-large (my first) due to added muscle from 6 months in the gym. The shirt fits really well and shows the curves but I dare not wash it for fear it will shrink a little (cleaners), but if you're an average size build with not too much muscle thin this shirt should fit just fine. It is comfortable and like that I can wear it dressy with sports coat or casual.  no way I'm ordering xx large"
5.0,Great Glasses
5.0,I’ve bought from multiple sellers different tanks stringers and this has me sold plus the compliments I got at the gym 😅
5.0,I am allergic to any metal on wrist bands and this on has been perfect! The pattern is just as pictured and very comfortable!
5.0,"Love my hat! Vibrant colors and being adjustable obviously perfect fit :) love everything about it, great brand."
5.0,"I'll tell you what, for $20 this poncho cape is perfect!  I am 5'3&#34; and it just covers my butt.  I bought the tan/gray and while it's not cashmere (not for $20), it's very soft and comfy.  I think I may buy the black/gray one for darker outfits!"
5.0,I enjoy the fit.
5.0,Great gift idea for a Jaws fan!
5.0,I ordered a small but needed a medium great outfit I reordered loved it
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for at a great price.
5.0,"So cute! The padding is a little weird, so I took it out."
5.0,Great Quality!
5.0,the pair looks exactly like what's shown in the picture and it fits my cheetah theme for this year's Halloween.
5.0,"I also wear these to work.<br />The flexibility in movement they allow is great.<br />Almost like wearing nothing, except the support is there."
5.0,"Was about a half size too small, I'm around a 9 to 9.5, ordered the 10, my toes are almost over the edge, but otherwise they were working wonderfully as a shower sandal"
5.0,This dress fit me perfectly fine. The size was perfect.Would definitely buy another one.
5.0,Great Frye quality and pretty comfortable considering the heel height and pointy toe.
5.0,Best product ever! Very light and comfortable!
5.0,My son loves them he likes that they match my ray bans. I just ordered the blue ones per his request. I like that they come with a small bag too.
5.0,"I have a very petite three year old. I had to safety pin the shorts, but she loved them all the same. Hopefully, we'll get a lot of months out of them."
5.0,very pretty worked perfect for homecoming jewelry
5.0,I was very surprised at how well this worked for what it cost. Great buy.......
5.0,Cute and comfortable. Well made.
5.0,"My daughter is 14 and didn't like traditional swimwear that shows a lot of skin. She actually picked this out because of how well it covered her up and was thrilled when it arrived. She wore it camp and loved it, she was also pleased to get several compliments on her swimwear."
5.0,"After looking at all the options, I decided on this one.  I wasn't expecting much given the price, but I was hopeful.  What a great surprise!  I love the heft of the band, the overall quality really is amazing, and the price was an added bonus.  I had to take out 7 links with the supplied tool, and I usually wear the Fitbit large band on the second to last (smallest) slot.  I recommend watching the YouTube video link they provide, because it really is simple to do, but I can see how the tool would be easily broken if you're not lined up well.  When I put the band back together the first time, I didn't realize that I had missed the hole on one side of the link.  A day later I noticed that the band had a small gap between two of the links.  It was pretty easy to remove the pin and realign the links.  Just watch that everything is snug and lined up.  I've had the band for almost two months now, it looks amazing and I wear it 24/7 (except in the shower/swimming).  I highly recommend this one."
5.0,"This beautiful dress fits perfectly, so glad I ordered two."
5.0,5 year old girl loved them. Stick well and good variety to keep them interested!
5.0,"These leggings are just as described, and for the price you are paying you are getting a fabulous deal! The fabric is thick, and silky smooth. They are totally squat proof, fit exactly to size and stay put!!! I can't believe the price on these! I would buy these over Lulu, Fabletics or Athleta in a heartbeat! I have found my new favorite brand!"
5.0,"Very reasonably priced & they are a great quality. Just add a simple necklace & you're stylish.  I really loved these charms, one for a bracelet as will.  They mean something to me though.  Be brave, have hope & dream.  All the positive words for a troubled world."
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!
5.0,I love the lightness and the buttons
5.0,"I was impressed when I opened this coz it was contained in a hard case. That made it more neat coz u can just out it in ur bag, then off to the pool. As for the clasp, I like it. I used tonite the one that u just slipped on ur head, and for someone with long hair, it makes me miserable coz it pulls some of my hair. For this, that doesn't happen because of the clasp at the back. Just click it and it prevents pulling of hair."
5.0,So adorable! My granddaughter loves this leotard and wears it proudly in ballet class. The quality is good but the material is quite thin.
5.0,Lightweight and relatively comfortable (I glued in a thin gel insole and now can walk in them for miles). Good for wider feet.
5.0,Love them fast shipping..!!'
5.0,I like these stud earrings
5.0,Love the quality and simple elegance
5.0,Nice color. So far so good
5.0,"A really well made hat. Very warm, great value."
5.0,Perfect 👍🏻
5.0,"I am a cosplayer and I’ll tell you these shoes look amazing! The straps are so well made, the socks are thick and feel like real socks. It looks just like the picture! The clear straps took me a second to figure out but once I did everything felt awesome! The shoe fits me perfectly and walking don’t hurt! I’m a size 8-8 1/2 in women’s and the smallest size fit perfect so I suggest the next size bracket if you have bigger feet than I do! Again this product is amazing and I recommend buying these shoes!!"
5.0,"I’m attaching it to my “Apple Watch”, at the band/watch connection !  It will<br />Be a “constant” reminder of one of our most precious things to e need to protect on this earth “ the oceans”❣️😉🌺"
5.0,Great PJ set
5.0,This dress was perfect! I'm normally a size 8/10 so a Large was actually perfect. I did have to wear spanx underneath because I am very self conscious about my tummy since it's white. I had so many compliments about the dress and they cant believe I bought this on Amazon. Great buy!
5.0,I bought for gift. She love it and good quality fast shipping 💖
5.0,"I gave 5 stars because these gloves are very nice, the quality and all eventhough the size that i got is a little big for me."
5.0,Good product thinner than I expected.
5.0,I order this for my mom because she is diabetic and lots of swelling on both legs.  She liked it very much when they arrived.  I ordered the polka dots.
5.0,"So comfy I ordered 2 pairs! Love the high waisted fit and the length. Material is soft and stretchy, ordered my usual size and the fit was just right."
5.0,"This was a gift for my daughter.  It was something I'd never seen before, but seemed like a great concept. My daughter loves it. She said she gets lots of compliments and questions about it.  It arrived on time and in perfect condition."
5.0,Great boot.  Keeps my feet dry. My last pair had 1000g of thinsulate.  I wish these did however they are not bad at all.  Like the look and they feel good on my feet after they broke in.  Only took like 2 days of wearing for the break in.
5.0,Great summer top. Fits well and covers everything. The neck isn’t too low and the armholes aren’t too big. Washes and dries nice. I hang it up to dry. I bought the blue paisley and wish there were different designs as I’m not a fan of big flowers.
5.0,I got this for a cruise. It is very comfortable and the fit is just right.
5.0,"Beautiful cufflinks with a very elegant and subtle design. The gold and silver color complement each other ver well. The lines that you see in the picture are not visible, you have to look real close."
5.0,Very pretty!<br /><br />Update: Broke off my neck while I was just standing there.  I had it on for about 20 mins.
5.0,Love it- bought for a themed party everyone loved it.
5.0,Very nice- perfect for my needs.
5.0,Grandson went bonkers over these pjs
5.0,This is the most comfy and sexiest sock I ever bought myself. It makes me the coolest guy at school!!!
5.0,"This came in just last weekend and I immediately opened it and tried it on. I am 5' and 155 lbs and I bought a large thinking I would need to, but a medium would have fit. I'm keeping it, however, since I like a looser fit. The quality is amazing and better than I expected. It's a thick jacket, very soft fabric, and would be perfect in the fall/winter. I actually bought it because I'm a huge Steven Universe fan thinking it'd just be good for cosplay but this would definitely work as just a normal jacket as well."
5.0,I love this style & plan to order a couple more over the weekened. Goes great with my previous purchase.  Have received alot of compliments on my rings. People are &#34;Where did you get this at&#34;! I have ra diease & my ting slides right in. I would rate this a 10
5.0,Absolutely love these
5.0,I ordered this dress as a Christmas dress! It fit nicely & I received many compliments... The only thing I can say is that I had to pay extra to get it shipped for Christmas - it was worth it though!!
5.0,This is a great tank top that is thick enough to wear on the cooler nights in the fall spring and summer. I often dont need to wear anything else over it unless it gets real breezy. The color is vibrant and bright even after subsequent washes. The material also holds up well in the wash.
5.0,"Fit great, looks amazing and real."
5.0,Adorable and arrived super fast!
5.0,Beautiful piece. My wife loves it!
5.0,"Cute, simple and classy. I love them."
5.0,I have several of these bands. They are easy to adjust and are GORGEOUS. Sturdy and well made.
5.0,Got all my things and the one prob I had they fixed for me thanks
5.0,"These shirts run big, and they are not a polo as described in the description, they are button down shirts. Had to return mine as I ordered a 2XL. I really like the shirt but will order an XL and like it as a button down. Really wish this was a polo."
5.0,I LOVE these socks...so colorful & fun both for myself or as a gift!
5.0,"these are so expensive in the store, I found these for only a few dollars and they are great, fit great and seem to be of good quality material."
5.0,Looks and feels good.  I ordered the small and it fits me (33 Waist) perfect.
5.0,"Great fit and comfortable.  These are the first pair I ever bought online and I love them.  Even better, I don't notice I have them on."
5.0,This dress is very flattering on plus size figures. I am a 16 and ordered 2XL. It fit snug in all the right places. I did notice the dress moves with you - at times even bunched you on the side. But overall a great dress for work.
5.0,Look good fit good
5.0,Beautiful piece of jewelry perfect for a person who loves dainty yet complex pieces of jewelry. Picture dosent do product justice
5.0,Love them!!! Harry Potter all the way !!!
5.0,"As soon as I opened I though this is poor quality until I tried and fit perfectly, beautiful dress"
5.0,They were adorable.
5.0,GREAT BAG!! Kept stuff cold for over 24 hours with ice still there at almost 30 hours. Greag purchase and will totally recommend this bag to everyone!
5.0,"Super cute, love it"
5.0,"Absolutely gorgeous! You can dress it up, you can dress it down, perfect for everyday wear. It truly is elegant I love the color! It was packaged well and arrived I’ll definitely be ordering more as gifts!"
5.0,I needed something quick to buy for a anniversary party. This dress worked out great.
5.0,Had to reorder in a size bigger - great quality shoe - looks great. My daughter loves them!
5.0,Product arrived on time I had a feeling they would run a little small but I have average calf Size so I was not worried about it I’m very please with them I bought also a pan nursemaid shoes and I’m on my feet about nine hours straight out of the day and my legs do not feel tired or ache
5.0,"I LOVE these glasses. They fit great,  look great, and come with a nice case. I got the green ones. Highly recommend these! :)"
5.0,"Exactly as pictured. I really like it, but I put it on a slightly longer chain."
5.0,Great way to keep her happy and smiling! She has worn it everyday since her birthday. Tells me all about people asking about it and how beautiful it is. thank you for a great gift for my wife.
5.0,CUTE BUT TIGHTEN THE CLASP TO AVOID LOSS  MINE FELL OFF BUT LUCKILY I NOTICED
5.0,Great buying more!
5.0,I LOVE this skirt! I've had it for a couple of years and it is so cute! I can dress it up or dress it down.  It has barely even faded and I've washed it multiple times!
5.0,"I love these earrings. I couldn't believe how cheap they were but, I figured, why not try them? I wear these on a regular basis, usually about once a week. Really amazing deal. Shipping was fast!"
5.0,I originally bought eyeglass holders at my optical store and they came apart as I was putting them on my sunglasses. Ordered these and they are not only very robust and functional but I love the colors! They wre well designed and I will trust using these with both my prescription eye glasses and sunglasses for an upcoming photography trip.
5.0,So nice love them
5.0,"My 13-yr old picked this coat out and really likes it.  The coat is a little bit fitted, and seems to be waterproof.  I ordered the medium since the small was not available, and it doesn’t seem super big on her.  Be aware that this is not a thick winter jacket, but more of an outer shell…which would require additional layers to stay warm on cold days."
5.0,"Bought it for my son for a family Disney trip. He loved it, didn't want to take it off. Good quality as well."
5.0,Bought this 24k pink rose for our 25th anniversary. I'm a hero!  Very nice!!
5.0,Great hat..my wife loved it
5.0,As expected... warm & cozy
5.0,"Good quality. Doesn't leak, although I hear most flasks will eventually, however this can be easily fixed by using a washer or some other seal in the lid. Very classy looking as well, definitely a good buy."
5.0,I got this as gift the love it . really cute item.
5.0,"Very durable,tight fit.  Was told the look awesome on my legs!!!  Will be getting more in the future (and of different colors as well.)"
5.0,Perfect fit and quality
5.0,"Excelente calidad, muy bien hecho los dibujos"
5.0,Sleep
5.0,I have small wrists and this is more comfortable than the original band. It was a little tricky to install only due to the watch itself - the product was fine.
5.0,These are the only masks my husband will wear. I love them too! You can breathe easily and the quality of the masks is wonderful. Doesn’t make my nose itch when I talk and it’s super breathable and I don’t feel sweaty wearing it after an extended period of time!
5.0,Perfect! I bought these for my nieces baptism and hopefully something they can cherish through their journey with Christ.<br /><br />I will add this is also not silver underneath as it failed the magnetic test. I thought these were silver with 18k gold plated. But it’s not. Just an FYI.
5.0,This was an exact duplicate of the band that had worn out. Clearances are quite close - had to have a jeweler install the band because I couldn't get the spring bars to engage. Excellent band.
5.0,It’s a cute skirt and loved the lights. My daughter got it for her 3rd birthday and she enjoyed every minute of wearing it.
5.0,"second one is perfect, first order was ripped in two places"
5.0,"I MUST SAY I WAS EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE! IT IS EXACTLY LIKE IT IS DESCRIBED. NOT TOO BIG AND NOT TOO SMALL. I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW, SHE IS IN LOVE WITH IT! I MUST MENTION THAT I ORDERED IT ON WEDNESDAY AND SHE RECEIVED IT THAT SATURDAY, EXTREMELY QUICK FOR SOMETHING PERSONALIZED!. I WILL DEFINITELY BE ORDERING FROM THEM AGAIN!"
5.0,Great.  3rd pair.
5.0,This kit contains various sizes which is nice. The quality is great. A bit difficult to remove old tips so buying heel pliers is not a bad idea.
5.0,"I bought this for my husband and since Halloween costumes sometimes run small, I purchased a large instead of his usual medium. This costume really does fit true to size though because it was a little big on him, but he was still able to wear it. He said it was very comfortable, like wearing pajamas, and it went perfectly with my cop costume. The material was also  good quality for a costume."
5.0,A good amount of stretch to it. But fit as expected. I generally wear a large shirt and glad I got th large. Usually can sizedown in scrubs but would recommend sticking with normal size. If you like loose size up.
5.0,Love the shirt. I should have bought a size larger. That was my fault. I do love the shirt.
5.0,Beautiful and elegant. Very shiny. Be aware that iPhone 6 or 7 plus does not fit in it. It fits basic stuff and small phones.
5.0,"I love this Bear Nightshirt! I have alot of compliments on my Hatley Nightshirts. There very comfortable and always look brand new after i was them.....Thanks, Sheri"
5.0,Sizing is as expected. Nice and comfortable but not super warm. Order up a size so you can wear some thick warm clothes underneath.
5.0,"It fits perfect and is really really pretty! If you don't know the right size and aren't sure, just whatever size dress you are, is this size."
5.0,This was a birthday gift for my 31 yr old son/engineer
5.0,"I ordered this shirt for work and it's great. It fits me well and is a nice materiel. I like the shade of blue, deep and not too bright, professional. The contrast of the black on the sleeves is just right. I ordered a Medium, I normally wear a M or L, and it's a great fit. The material is not sheer at all but it's thin enough to be comfortable and it feels like cotton. It has been a good buying experience and I would order more clothes from this brand without any hesitation."
5.0,These are a must for anyone with a small child. My 18-month old son has been wearing these for over a year as he likes to yank off his socks. These keep his socks on all day! Will be recommending these to all new parents!
5.0,Absolutely fabulous
5.0,Wish I would have found this item a long time ago. Works great on zippers too!
5.0,👏🏻👏🏻
5.0,Got these for my step dad for his birthday. He was excited to get them.
5.0,"Super cute. My daughter wanted to wear them as soon as they arrived. They looked exactly like the picture. Someone else mentioned the high sole was a little weird but it wasn't a deal breaker to me. My daughter wears a size 8 but they only had 9.5 available. It was a little loose, but not by much and not too long,  so I'd say they run a little bit small. I'm not sure how comfortable they truly are, but they didn't seem to bother my daughter once we tightened the ankle strap."
5.0,This shirt is so soft! And super cute. The arms are slightly tighter than I would like...but they still fit and the shirt is super cute

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:258ea58b975ed1dacc009605d9a9e95f]] Love these bands, I wear them all of the time!  Great value for the money, great sell contact, and I’ll definitely be purchasing from them again. This isn’t my first purchase from this seller. Like I said in my video, the package they came in was dirty and torn up, and consequently 2 bands had a little damage, but it was on the underneath of the band so I’m not concerned. I’m pretty sure it happened in shipping, not because of seller negligence."

5.0,Feminine and sporty
5.0,"I'm 5'3&#34;, 170 lbs  and ordered the large in navy polka dots. It fit perfectly. Not too long to wear with flat sandals either. I'm not sure what bra others wear with this style dress but as I'm a 38D, I wore a &#34;cami&#34; bra with mine and loved it!"

5.0,Received this necklace a few days ago and must say it is absolutely beautiful. I was looking for a replacement chain for my small cross pendant. It has nice weight and has a nice gold shine. Definitely looks and feels like a quality chain.
5.0,"I’ve worn it a few times now and I’m impressed. The belt is good quality and the ratchet type buckle is pretty awesome. I just have to change how I adjust the position of the buckle. I mistakenly grabbed the buckle to adjust, like I would with a normal belt, and it immediately came undone while standing at a crowded function. Definitely user error!"
5.0,Nice shorts for school
5.0,Lightweight but warm jammies. Perfect.
5.0,My daughter needed to use these in her classroom.  She said they are great!  It blocks the noise but she can still hear the teacher since she has a loud enough voice.  Highly recommend

5.0,Wonderful slippers.
5.0,Great value and quality.

5.0,These are so nice. I’m using the metal ones to stretch my ears. The color is awesome and hasn’t came off. All the baggies are labeled with each size.
5.0,"This mask is beautiful!  If you plan on wearing this for a function, it is very heavy on the face and you may find that some modifications may be necessary.  I changed the ribbon to an elastic band....this will require you to drill into the mask.  You will have to be artistic/handy."

5.0,"I can't believe I've waited this long to buy one of these. My eye sight is failing including my depth perception so wearing bracelets has been difficult unless they are slip on. This jewelry helper is easy to use. Now, I can wear bracelets again."
5.0,Too cute !
5.0,Nice sunglasses!
5.0,4 year old grandson noticed right away this was the movie Sonic! which I did not!  Very nice t shirt!  Great quality!  More like a dry fit material and not cotton!  Very nice!  Will wash well!

5.0,"Great fit, nice thick(but soft) material. Loved this dress so much. I went back and bought other colors. Bonus.... it has pockets 😍"
5.0,"This is a good value for the price. The shirt fits me fine, but is cut a little smaller than those made in the U.S. It is not too small to be unsatisfactory to me. I have been wearing these for months and they stand up to laundry and hold their color well.  To me, a good value and the shipping was fast."
5.0,The color was perfect and the tools provided made it easy to change the band.
5.0,"I ordered this dress for the Halloween office party. It appears that all the Halloween costumes are &#34;sexy&#34; & are not appropriate for an office setting during business hours.  With different pieces, I turned this dress into an Angel costume. Since Halloween in the MIdwest is usually cold, I needed something warmer, though I did have to wear extra clothing underneath (i.e. camisole & leggings) for extra warmth. Since it is white, it is a little sheer so it was good thing I did have the extra clothing underneath. With the crush velvet look & lace, it makes the garment a little more elegant than most &#34;cheesy&#34; costume dresses.  I also want to the note the Seller did a fabulous jobs of ensuring I would get this on time. It arrived on Halloween in the morning & I was able to make a quick change to participate in the office festivities."
5.0,Many compliments about this outfit. All parts of the white are fairly see through. If you are confident this is for you.
5.0,Good fit for my Race Vest 3.0
5.0,THE BEST GIFT EVER !!!!! EXCELLENT QUALITY

5.0,Amazing shirts. Don't hesitate.
5.0,Love this sweater may order another color as well! Will be a go to in my wardrobe
5.0,I am a co admin of a student club. I got these for all my co admins
5.0,Kids loved them!
5.0,I love this dress! it's lightweight and comfortable and so cute. It's a bit short so be on guard on breezy days (maybe wear biker shorts underneath just in case?) It's perfect for running errands or even for a casual date night. It's lightweight and breathes well for those really hot summer days. I will definitely be getting the money's worth out of this dress because it can be worn for so many occasions. I love it and would definitely get it again.
5.0,It was a gift for our daughter. She likes it. She uses it and is happy to wear it.<br /><br />Thank you
5.0,"I bought this bag because of the cute “wifey” written on it. The bag is not too big and not too small, I’d say it’s a medium size. It fits a lot more than I thought it could. The lining is nice and soft, not a cheap nylon/plastic type. The button seems secure and the straps are a nice leather. I like how it’s adjustable and I love the environmental goals of this company.  My 23 year old niece said it was cute. That’s a win for me."
5.0,They're great.  I've gotten compliments on them.
5.0,Fit great and they are some good looking Jean's I absolutely love it
5.0,"I received this purse from the hub's as a gift and it's beautiful! I've already had several compliments ... The leather is soft, smells wonderful, and the bad is sturdy enough to hold its original shape. I had one small problem with a missing zipper pull which was addressed very quickly and they made it better than right. I will definitely purchase from this company again and will recommend them!!"
5.0,It has a nice sculpted fit with a side zipper. I am 5' 3'' 130-35 pounds. Weight in the stomach/thigh/hip/butt area. Not super chesty. I think I'm in the upper bounds of who a small fits.

5.0,Great material..  fit and feel really good..
5.0,Perfect for the beach
5.0,Muy buenos lentes y me quedan perfectos!
5.0,Love these aviators!!!!

5.0,"FANTASTIC OAKLEY SUNGLASSES.  PERFECT LOOK AND FIT.  I ALSO LOVE THE COLOR.  A GREAT PRICE FOR THESE SHADES, WELL WORTH THE EXTRA BUCKS."
5.0,"This bra was a perfect choice, beautifully designed! I purchased it in Black and Tan. Wonderful to wear as a camisole, comfortable shape wear. The support is best investment. I’m ordering several more. It’s hard to find a bra this comfortable."
5.0,Quick shop and the dress feels and sits great. Very simple but business appropriate.
5.0,Love it. Goes with everything!
5.0,Really cute but heavy!
5.0,"Bought these for my second of two ear piercings.  I seldom wore jewelry there because I couldn't sleep comfortably in posts, so each time I'd get the urge to wear something there, it would be difficult to put an earring in and my ear would be tender and itchy all day.  And then I'd have to take them out at night!<br /><br />These were initially a tight fit, but I used a little antibiotic ointment to help get them in and I've been happy for four months.  They clip closed so neatly, I sometimes have a tough time finding the clasp when it's time to clean them.  I can sleep without any discomfort.  In fact, I think I will be purchasing a larger size to wear in my first hole and never worry about earrings again!"
5.0,"New favorite hoodie. Ordered a large, fits nicely, I am 160 lbs."
5.0,Got them for my hubby for Christmas.  Loves them.
5.0,"I'm a 44f and usually never find any sport like bras that fit me great. But my husband bought these bras for me and boy are they AMAZING!!!! love the material, the way they fit. They even support really well 🙂.<br />Signed,<br />One happy customer"
5.0,I love this little label printer. It was very easy to download the app and get it connected to my iPhone. I was printing labels within a few minutes of opening the box. Very happy with my purchase!

5.0,I use these for my daughter who has thin hair. They are durable and hold up well.
5.0,"This is so much fun!!! It fits great for our teen, hard to see out of so help was needed navigating around. Had loads of fun , kids LOVED seeing this giant inflatable Santa walking around. Pranked a neighbor pretending to be a yard inflatable. Easy to put on, Uses the standard inflatables fan and battery pack, with double AA batteries. 10 out of 10! Would recommend!!"
5.0,Light weight and comfortable. The 50 SPF was very effective.
5.0,Nice thick material. Worth the money. Very comfortable and had a drawstring.

5.0,"As an old head, who don't usually wear ear jewelry like this, I love this set.  It's really cute and I look &#34;cool&#34; with it on. LOL. . . Looks nice with casual wear."
5.0,"In the midst of a pandemic, every state it seems is requiring masks, so why not get one that is fashionable, comfortable and breathable? These masks have it all! For those that have to wear glasses, the ear loops make it so you can make sure your mask is properly placed and you are still able to see. The color options are great for everyday wear and hunting while still allowing you to feel like you can breathe and not stuck wearing something that makes living hard. I have family members who also purchased these masks, and I tell you, I will order more. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,The patches look great
5.0,I originally saw this beautiful cuff bracelet sold by a different vendor and missed the opportunity to purchase it as it very quickly became sold out. I searched the internet for some time unable to find it again but my last efforts led me to Amazon which I thought I had searched but in any event I found it and it is even more beautiful in person. It’s obviously a hard to find item so if you are on the fence about getting it order it NOW!! You wont be disappointed and you won’t see it on anyone else with it being so had to find.
5.0,"When I received my new watch yesterday, My expectations were exceeded well beyond what I anticipated. This watch is stunning, even more stunning was the price. A great looking watch and for a stretch band it has some really nice details. Terrific looking watch!"
5.0,"The dress is very flattering and comfortable! The pockets are deep enough to be genuinely functional but don’t look bulky if you actually use them. I am 5’2”, I ordered the small, and it was the perfect length while still fitting everywhere else!"
5.0,Nice and Warm! Thanks!
5.0,"Fits great, definitely a long maxi!"
5.0,We attached flashlights to them for kids and they worked well. No one last their flashlight either!
5.0,"I bought 2 different Zattcas dresses to take on vacation.  I was looking for something comfortable that didn't need to be ironed.  Both dresses packed beautifully and were ready to wear straight out of the suitcase. They're lightweight, perfect for a casual dinner or whenever you want to look good.  I am very glad that I purchased this dress."
5.0,"Great product, very comfortable and flattering. Most important it does not leave you breathless like most of the shapewears. The fabric is also good unlike typical shapewear which keeps riding up at the bottoms or rolling down at the tops. Thumbs up and highly recommend this."
5.0,Nice shoes used them a couple times and they feel good I feel good support on my ankles am happy with this shoes.
5.0,So far so good!!
5.0,These masks are excellent — extremely high quality and the added nose tightening feature really gives them a snug fit.  Plus the fabrics make these masks really comfortable and attractive.  Added feature of adjustable elastic straps made all the difference! Highly recommend.
5.0,Very cute fit but having hemmed a few inches tomorrow.
5.0,This bonnet was perfect for our pioneer project dress up.
5.0,"I usually look like I'm wearing a bag when I wear maxi dresses, but this dress is cyt just right! The side slits hit at the righ spot (I'm 5'7"") and it is long enough without dragging on the ground. The V neck is very flattering, and the fabric is light, but not see-through. Love!"
5.0,They are soft.Ny son loves them.
5.0,Nice light but warm scarf.
5.0,"These look cool on, but they run large. I bought a Medium for my 6 ft teenage son, but ended up giving them to my husband because they fit like a Large."
5.0,These fit like a glove and are so cute! I love them! ❤️❤️

5.0,Love it but I haven't worn it as yet.
5.0,"Make sure to size up. The material is not stretchy, nor do i expect it to last long. But for the price its a great dress to keep in your closet."
5.0,Arrived as described
5.0,"Quedan muy bonitas, pero el material es de mala calidad. Segunda vez que me las pongo y se están descosiendo."
5.0,The feel of this item is spot on.  Not super slick like silk or poly and not ruff or heavy like cotton.  Its sexy enough to be lingerie but light enough to still sleep in.  It is a little longer to cover my backside so it can be worn in the presence of little ones but not swimming below my knees so I get tangled in the night.  I would definitely buy this again.
5.0,"For the amount of money that you’re paying, you’re getting wayyyyy more value from this bag. It’s quite shocking to have something so nice and roomy for such a low price.<br />Highly recommended."
5.0,This shoe is very comfortable and light weight.<br />Would buy again.

5.0,Beautiful! Bought if for my super strong mamma bestie and she loved it :D
5.0,"Sizing is definitely different than Century. We went from a 1 in Century that was pretty short to a 2 in these that are dragging the ground. Not a problem, just make sure you read the size chart.<br /><br />They seem to be sturdy, well made, pants that will hold up to my son."
5.0,So cute! My daughter loves it!
5.0,nice fabric weight for skirt movement
5.0,"Fits perfectly. Fabric is soft, dense, “favorite T-shirt” quality. Very comfortable."
5.0,Really cute shirt- got it for my dad as a gift and he loves it!
5.0,"These are now my daily wear glasses. They hang on a cord and haven't broken, unlike five previous pairs. Bent once from a hug and I fixed them myself with my hands. Very easy to see my phone, computer and distance."
5.0,"This is so pretty.  It is very full.  I bought it for my daughter's 7th birthday. It has ribbons that allow you to adjust the size.  It fit her beautifully, but I could wear it too."
5.0,"Lightweight and flattering. First dress ripped while washing it, but they refunded an exchange and replaced it."
5.0,Only socks that fit my son and his Kankles  and won't fall off!

5.0,They look great and I am happy I bought them.  This was a great buy.  I was shocked to find this set so cheap. Must buy!
5.0,Bought this for my adult son as a Christmas gift. Did order a large because it is a jacket. He is usually a medium. Glad I got the large. Fits great and after washing it will still fit fine. He has been wearing this jacket every day. So it was a hit. He is about 5'6 and about 135lb.
5.0,Received compliments and felt great! The dress fits nicely to my curves. I would recommend.
5.0,"A little small in the arms, love the design and colors. Very flattering dress."
5.0,"Received these much quicker than I had planned, I waited maybe a week for these to come in. The colors are as  shown.  I think it is a fabulous idea for them to be two colors.  They are everything I had hoped and more for the price!"
5.0,"Just got these today so I can’t attest to how they hold up, but they fit great and were really comfy when I tried them on. Will be purchasing another pair."
5.0,I received this swimsuit when it was expect. It was packaged well and arrived safely. I really like this swimsuit it fit perfect. The material is made will and not to binding which makes it easy to put on. The elastic in the legs is a little loose and could have had stronger elastic but I can fix that myself. I can't wait till summer and the water park opens to be able to use this. Thank you for approving me to try your product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,"Very pretty, delicate necklace. Color was deeper than photo, but beautiful nonetheless."

5.0,"Beautifully made hat, fits perfectly & can be packed in a suitcase & resumes shape easily!"
5.0,"Bright beautiful color, amazing quality plus great fit!! 100%"
5.0,Great belt! Careful to not get a squeaky one.
5.0,Love these!! Have 4 of them in different colors.I like that they aren’t tight . Look cute on and also great to workout in. You can change it up with different sports bras underneath. I would def recommend to others.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:3120f6edefe8c223c1019cbf42a5a42e]]
5.0,"I am pleased with the quality. Big enough but not too big. The zipper can be a little annoying when trying to slip the laptop into it, but it suits my style and needs and that's a win."

5.0,"I like my new purse, only wish it had more compartments"
5.0,"I needed a nice black dress for a black tie event I'm attending and this checked all my boxes- no need to hem, no special bras necessary, flattering, a little bit of detail to make it pop. I am 5'3 and 117 pounds and a 30F and got the medium and it's a perfect fit! It's got a bit of stretch and the waist his in the exact right place. The length is right below my knees. I'm very happy with it and it seems like it will travel without too many wrinkles! I decided I prefer it without the belt."
5.0,Got this for my husband and it fits perfectly. He is a 3x so ordered a size larger 4x.
5.0,Looks great and the quality it's really good..! Pretty much u get what u pay for..!!! LOVE IT..!
5.0,"My husband is extremely impressed with his wedding band. It looks like real gold. It's heavy! It's very sturdy. He's a rough man, and this ring has lasted him! We both love it.<br /><br />I know I wrote the above review in February. But my husband’s been wearing this ring for over a year, and it still does not have any scratches! It is an awesome ring. Neither of us have any complaints. He shows it off & brags about it often!"
5.0,"These are definitely my favorite sunglasses! I especially love the mirrored lenses. My husband tries to steal them from me any chance he gets. The aviator design is so cool and looks good on almost everyone!<br /><br />Although it's made from plastic and not metal, it's still a really nice pair of shades. They don't look or feel cheap at all. I think I may end up giving the silver one to my husband and getting the gold one for myself!"

5.0,I had a gigantic splotch of scratches on mine right in front of my eye. These saved me. So far so good.
5.0,Pin looks great and shows well. very pleased.
5.0,My son loved them ..got two sets so we had to return one but he loves the one he kept..he is a firm believer in grounding and he swears these will help.
5.0,Bought for my 19 year old daughter. We both love Silversun Pickups! Seemed to be good quality material and graphics. She loved. She normally where’s a medium and it fit well.
5.0,Beautiful color style
5.0,Very nice! Crisp and clear color
5.0,These buttons are high quality and individually wrapped. They are colorful and I’ve gotten many compliments on them. Perfect for showing your pride for our country and our right to vote!

5.0,"Me gusta, ya lo probé"
5.0,Easy to use; good value
5.0,This dress is darling!  I paired it with a coral pink wrap belt and accessories. Have received lots of compliments!  Highly recommend!
5.0,I love this dress and will be ordering more in different colors! It’s very light and the fabric is so soft. And you can never go wrong with pockets!
5.0,These are great.  I bought a size up as I didn't want the fit to be too tight.  The material is light weight and soft.  They stay in place great.  I like them as so many workout tops are shorter than I'd like for when I'm lifting my arms up high.  With these underneath I'm never worried about my stomach being exposed.  They are great under a shirt or on their own.  I bought 2 sets I loved them so much.
5.0,Granddaughter  loved her first passport holder
5.0,"Excellent, thank you."
5.0,Needed something to hold my keys or a drink when out on short trips (long trips are a CamelBak). I switched one of the straps to the other side so they connect at the 9 and 12 o clock positions. This seemed most stable (especially when weighted) and most unobtrusive to my knee when turning. This gives good access to the one hand strap and external slip pocket. The outer pocket is small and won't fit most newer cell phones.
5.0,Love this hat especially on my bad hair days (lol) I just throw my hair up in a ponytail and put my hat on.. it's super cute!
5.0,So cute totally made my costume
5.0,Absolutely love these earrings! They are a little “full” but still really cute!
5.0,My son (age 11) likes the way they look and fit.  I like the price.

5.0,Very large & sturdy
5.0,"they are very useful ,  just tried those and they are amazing but i do recommend for any frequent traveler to own"
5.0,"It was a B-Day present for my daughter, 31 now.<br />She loved it especially in the blue."

5.0,I love this ring and can't wait to wear it often.<br />Note: No skin discoloration after several hours of nonstop wear!
5.0,"My wife likes the blue print of this dress-like Jumpsuit.  The size small fit my wife fairly well.  She is 5'1"", about 115lbs, and normally wears a size 2-4  in Juniors or Petite.  She said this is comfortable and light, and I think she looks pretty in it!"
5.0,"This very sexy shirt was a nice surprise. The buttons let you wear it as open and deep as the model in the picture, but you can also button it up all the way for a more modest look. It's ever-so-slightly sheer; my arm tattoos show through it in the right light but it's not what you'd call transparent. All in all this is a sharp, sexy look for a great price."
5.0,"The entire inside of the jacket is lined, very soft and comfortable. May want to order a size up, especially if you have long arms or a long torso; I wish I did but it still fits fine enough."
5.0,comes in good condition works well comes with an extra pack
5.0,Very nice. Do not slip
5.0,I love love love this dress for work! Great fit and great price!!!
5.0,Amazing. Cute look and it fits perfectly
5.0,Very delicate and petite necklace. I didn't realize it was going to be so tiny. But it's very cute. I have not had any issues with rusting but I also don't wear it when I bathe. A nice gift idea because it's so basic
5.0,Super cute!!! So glad I ordered this!!
5.0,"This cap fits wells and I get a ton of compliments on it. I bought the white and pink floral color. Not too big, not too small. Washes well. There are buttons sewed on (I think it's a new thing, I bought a cap from them last month and there weren't buttons) and they hold my mask up well for work."
5.0,"I love these rings. I took off the metal piece so that I could wear these rings either all together or just the certain colors together. So much more comfortable with out that piece on it, too.<br />I wear these rings all the time.<br />They are high-quality & totally worth it!!"
5.0,my wife loves it ! works great
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with these buttons.  I ordered them to ""upscale"" a nice, but inexpensive, blazer that came with the cheap-looking buttons that many manufacturers use.  I haven't sewn them on yet, but they are going to look great."
5.0,Fits great! Great dress for casual dinner at beach.
5.0,What I like about these are that as a young girl this is what I worn and they were very comfortable  even though I worn the high tops ..love converses
5.0,Show your love of cats!
5.0,"I like the material, pockets and flattering fit.  The only thing I didn’t like was the length.  A little too long for me so it had to be hemmed."
5.0,"Arrived on time. super cute design for a 4 yr old, bright and fun"
5.0,I love the DOLLAR Sign heel just great cant wait to wear them
5.0,"I wear a size 14, sometimes 16 and it fits perfect."
5.0,Just as described and pictured
5.0,These feel silky smooth when wearing!
5.0,They make me feel fit!

5.0,This band makes the Gear Fit 2 look very classy.
5.0,The young lady I bought this for really likes it.<br />Fits excellent and so cute - love the color 💜
5.0,This is the 2nd time I've bought and will buy more. The stones were nice and the service was A+. John
5.0,"I just got these in and they are basically the shoes of my dreams. I have worn Vibrams for years and years but they have their issues (stitching durability, differently shaped toes, really strange looks from people that see them). I wish I had found these before. I have been relegated to basically wearing mocassins in public and they wear pretty quickly and don't do well with rain. These are perfect. They are very well made and fit perfectly. They fit a little small for what some people may be used to but wearing them regularly should remedy that. I have been wishing there was a shoe out there like this for so long. I am hoping they last me a reasonable amount of time!"
5.0,This ring is perfect!!! Love it! My finger is a 5 1/2 so I needed to completely close the ring for it to fit. The quality is great and I have recieved many compliments!! Highly recommend!
5.0,Got these for my wife because she hates drawstrings on pajamas. It's hard to find elastic banded pajamas. These fit her perfectly and are comfortable. Great deal.
5.0,I was surprised at how well made this zip-up key case is. It is exactly what I need for my keys and to keep things in my bag protected from keys .
5.0,Easy to put on. Comfortable.
5.0,This is a super cute hat and Authentic Disney so you know its good quality!
5.0,I love this tee! It is so flattering! I get many compliments when I wear it.
5.0,The girl loved them.
5.0,Very nice quality!!!
5.0,Nice material and the pockets don’t pucker out!
5.0,The fabric is not the best but good enough and it feels good on the body. I love Akatsuki and this T-shirt is awesome as an alternative to the Akatsuki Cloak. I recommend it.
5.0,To start I am a big supporter of  US law-enforcement agencies and I collect hats like CIA FBI DEA ATFand ice that’s why I call them alphabet hats I went on Amazon and saw that there were some sellers selling hats  like The one for the NSA national security agency  very hard to come bye it fits great and it’s great quality I don’t know problem buying from this seller again and I recommend it strongly!
5.0,they work well
5.0,My daughter loves these socks for riding.  Color holds up well to fading and product wears well.
5.0,Color and fabric were good.
5.0,Loved it. Bought a small. Runs a little big.
5.0,"I just recently purchased this glider, and I couldn't be more thrilled. This is one of the most comfortable gliders.  It glides so incredibly smoothly that it feels like you are floating.  And, being an about-to-be single mom, the fact that the assembly was sooo easy was a big plus, too.  All I had to do was turn the seat portion upside down;  place the glider mechanism on top of that, and install 4 screws and washers in the pre-drilled holes.  It couldn't have been easier.  I've already spent quite a bit of time in this glider, and my baby girl is not even due until June 20, 2002!  I know she'll love it, too!  Happy Gliding!!!"
5.0,I must say I didn't expect the watch to be this heavy. I love it. It's a tank. Very well made. This is my fourth Victorinox watch. I'm very pleased. 2 options on the band. Highly recommend
5.0,Best leggings ever!
5.0,"IF IT HAS RAIDERS ON IT, I LOVE IT. THANKS"
5.0,Stand out from the rest and have a unique look.  Haven’t wore them yet but will update if it doesn’t work out.
5.0,Very pretty. Simple and elegant! Great price for bracelets!!

5.0,I love this shirt! So comfortable. Looks great. Fits exactly how I wanted it to.
5.0,This turned out to be my daughters' favorite bathing suit. She loves it
5.0,Absolutely love this shirt. So soft and adorable. Perfect plus-size fit (fits exactly to size!) 🥰💯
5.0,"Beautiful earrings.  Very classy.  I have very sensitive earlobes but these did not bother me all night.  I cannot wear silver, brass or costume jewelry without itching.  I wore these for 5 hours without incident.  Very impressed by the quality.  I went back tot he description to see what material they are and it says silver plated but it must be over surgical steel because normal silver plating bothers me.  I am positive these are truly nickel free also.  I am very glad i found these earrings....I am not a jewelry expert but i have real sapphire jewelry and these are super close to the same quality.  I will try to care for these to make them last :) I added a little shot of the earrings from our photo....hope it helps but it wasn't a picture of the earrings :("
5.0,Great quality thick lettering & hat material.

5.0,I really like this one way better frl
5.0,Product arrived quickly. It was easy to change out the watch bands. No problems yet with the band disconnecting. Cleaning is a breeze.
5.0,"Soft material and stays on, even with over night tossing and turning"
5.0,loves these earrings
5.0,"very nice gloves for the price.  i was expecting a lower quality product as i only needed them for a costume. they turned out to be a great fit, good quality and will definitely get used throughout the cold months."
5.0,"Definitely comfy casual. 5'1 140 bought a medium, fits perfectly until I eat! 🤣<br />Super cute. Tshirt like material."
5.0,"Just the right length for the pendant I wanted to wear. As expected, it does darken a bit over time, but I was wearing my necklace 24/7 for over a year. It snaps in place securely, and was a good value for the money."
5.0,Best belt I’ve ever owned
5.0,Nice replacement for my Tumi wallet
5.0,The shirt is a great quality. Fits well. Didn’t shrink in the wash. It’s one of my go to Friday work shirts now. Compliments from teachers and students
5.0,"Totally phenomenal. I was able to communicate with T-Bot via Discord and text message. Within just a few days, they messaged me and set up a time to meet on my island. Omg, SO MUCH STUFF!!! They started dropping my costume pieces at my island and it JUST KEPT GOING! We said our thank you’s and farewells, and then they left! All in all, about a 15-20 minute ordeal, and SOOOOO WORTH IT! I now have Halloween costumes for dayyyyys. And T-Bot was of course very friendly and professional the entire time. I will definitely be back!!!"
5.0,This hat fits very well with a straight bill. Very nice
5.0,The stockings are very cute and fit perfect.  They are a very nice addition to my halloween costume as the Queen of Hearts.  Very comfortable and nice quality.
5.0,Fit better than expected. No complaints here
5.0,It’s super soft and comfy and love the pockets
5.0,Best costume jewelry ever! High quality
5.0,Very dainty and just as expected. Great!
5.0,Would buy agaib
5.0,Good quality. Closure easy to use but secure.
5.0,This starfish necklace is perfect for me. I'm going on a cruise and wanted something to wear that fit with the moment.  Most of my jewelry is Southwestern native Amercan style stuff.
5.0,This is soft and I can breath. This works with any mask your wearing.
5.0,I love these shoes. The online picture is true to the actual shoe. The material is amazing and doesn't feel cheap. Totally gender neutral
5.0,Good quality material and color
5.0,I think the material is a little thin and lightweight
5.0,Perfect for the price!
5.0,Purchased for my nephew for Christmas he absolutely loved it!!
5.0,I really love this t-shirt. It’s a little loose fitting ( I bought a large) and I get so many compliments when I wear it❤️
5.0,I'm grateful I ordered 2 as they are a favorite for my son. He's says they give him super powers.
5.0,"For once, I got slippers that look good and fit right. Also, for once they don't have that stupid fake fur inside. All that fur does is make your feet stink, and it never cleans up, always looks dirty. The outside material looks great and just enough padding for comfort, not enough to make them too tight. Great soul so you can run outside to get the mail. Overall a perfect purchase and hope I can get these again when I need em."
5.0,"Worked ok, washed them a couple times.  Black is not the color for hot weather however...got uncomfortably warm"
5.0,Super soft fabric. Love it so much i bought another. Print is clear and has great color.
5.0,Nice charm bracelet. Ok quality for the price. My friend liked it but couldn’t wear it as it reacted with her skin.
5.0,Awesome watch
5.0,It is very nice for the money good for a kick around
5.0,It was just like the picture online. I was surprised at some of the negative comments. My bracelet and necklace were perfect. I am not certain what people expect for the affordable price but mine was a great deal!
5.0,I love this dress for work and it's a good quality material for the price. It's very comfortable and true to size
5.0,"I love the rose gold look. They are stylist, partial and worth the money."
5.0,"Super duper cute ! Got it for my daughter, comfortable fit and very soft feel. Plenty of compliments when she wears it. Definitely getting more colors ! 5/5 all day long."
5.0,"This fits a larger wrist. I did not know this, my wrist is small, so I gifted it. Pretty"
5.0,it fits my girlfriend perfectly
5.0,"I purchased this as a beach/swim coverup but I think I'll wear it around in the summer also. It is poly but overall very flattering on. The way its cut and with the fabric draping over, it covers just the right parts and shows just the right parts :) I'm 5'5'' and and would consider this short as short as I would wear a skirt/dress. If I were any taller I would be returning it due to length.<br /><br />I ordered the blue with orange and red patterns and really love the look. I examined the stretching and believe it to be very well constructed.<br /><br />I'm about to order another one!"
5.0,Comfy and great socks!
5.0,"Really cute, and true to size. These made our cat lover really, very happy."
5.0,Great quality for the price. Lightweight and not restrictive during my last few runs.
5.0,Love them !  Fit is perfect. They stay up on the ankle. The grips keep me from slipping on our wood floors and wiping out!
5.0,"I ordered these by mistake, but when I tried to cancel my order, it was too late.  I was emailed that when they arrived I could return them.  However, when I received them they were very nice.  Because the price was so reasonable I decided to give them to the homeless.<br />Amazon has treated me well, so why not forward the socks."
5.0,Beautiful  dress material and print are lovely it just runs a little wide<br />I'm usually a meduim and i got a medium but it's slightly wide i just think a small will be too small
5.0,Everyone that sees this necklace love it. Well worth it for the price
5.0,Lightweight yet warm.  Wash and hold up well.
5.0,These shades are very stylish! The construction is very sturdy as well! They look expensive while wearing them and I received a lot of compliments. I'd definitely buy another pair from this seller in the future!
5.0,More beautiful in person.
5.0,They run a little small but I am keeping them for the summer.
5.0,"These are the best! So comfy, perfect fit, and you can't beat the price. I have purchased similar styles from lululemon in the past and they are more expensive and less comfortable. I will never go back!"
5.0,"Great value. Fabric has a good 'hand' and washes well. It's perfect light, good-weather robe."
5.0,I love this dress!!! It’s so comfy and the material is great! I got so many complements and the fact that it has pockets is amazinggggg! I’m 5’6” and I wore flats because I didn’t want it to be too high above the ground I wanted a long dress. It came just a tad bit higher than my ankle. 100% recommend!!
5.0,Good quality. I’m very happy with my order.
5.0,Purchased this to add to my cousins wedding dress and it was perfect! It was a great size and easy to apply! I ordered a larger ribbon to go with it and put it on my heat press to apply and it came out amazing!
5.0,"My sister in law loved the purse, the quality, and the stitching. Perfect gift."
5.0,Dislike not being able to add prescription lens.
5.0,i love this charm!! looks great on my bracelett !! i love the syle of the charm. i love my baltimore ravens!!!
5.0,"Holds more than I thought possible.  Great for groceries, crafts, whatever you need to transport.  Rolls easily.  Took a few steps with no difficulty.  I did not try it on a whole flight."
5.0,Simply  beautiful
5.0,I loved that it shipped in a big enough box to not smash the fascinator! It kept perfect shape!
5.0,Love these socks! They stay up and are super comfy!
5.0,These stay on very well and are comfortable.  I've had them for a long time and no holes or issues.  Favorite socks to pair with my Keds.
5.0,"The color, fit, and style is exactly like you’d imagine. I found it sat well above my hips (intentionally) and I received a lot of compliments"
5.0,"Fits good but if you have broad shoulders, it's a little tight in that area."
5.0,"This dress surprised me. The material is really nice. It is long but you stay cool in it. I am 5'3"" and the length was perfect for me. I wanted it to the tops of my feet or at ankle. I got a lot of compliments so I ordered the red one too."
5.0,Love them i got two part. I might order some more. Came earlier than the date.
5.0,Comfort-keeps sun out

5.0,Perfect fit and soft material. This was my 3rd purchase.
5.0,Cool steampunk look
5.0,Different. Like it.
5.0,Love this compression leggings. It is very form fitting and it is stretchy as well while holding all the things in place. Not see through which is great. Ordered a size Small and it fits true to size. High waisted.
5.0,"These are lightweight, easy to see, but not so large they take attention away from more important features. That makes them perfect for earrings and other jewelry I make. They shine but not so obvious.<br /><br />I've also used them to glue to my bottle crafts as leaves on a tree. I sorted the different colors/metals and found there are so many they go a long way in lots of different crafts. I can see where they'd work well with scrapbooking, too. I haven't even used them for everything I've thought of yet, but I will! I'll be getting more, too."
5.0,Got this for my son who plays football (he's 7) he loves that it makes him feel like a real player with his jersey number on a chain. So far we've had it like 3 weeks and he was worn it 4x and it's held up nicely. Hopefully it lasts the whole season and feels like it will.
5.0,Its a very good to buy. Like it.
5.0,"Really cute! My 6 month old is currently in 12 month clothes, so this sleeper in 12-18 months fits him great with a bit of room to grow. Plus the colors are vibrant and fun."
5.0,Bought this for my daughter’s bracelet with her and her boyfriend ‘s initials And pets
5.0,Very flattering and cute
5.0,So cute. Fast delivery and fits phone perfectly.
5.0,Es lo que esperaba
5.0,Solid Quality at a reasonable price. Was worried about glass breaking in shipping but it was packaged well and held up.
5.0,"Super comfortable, nice material and vibrant colors. Probably about 2 sizes too big, but it fit as expected because I ordered one that is 2 sizes too big."
5.0,"Heavy, good quality ornament. My wwe fan loved it."
5.0,"I really don't do tank tops because I have this mental block you have to have the perfect body to wear them. Got over this block and I (and my wife) love these.<br /><br />I am 5'11"" , 191lbs and evenly proportioned to give a reference."
5.0,Our shirt fits great! Got it for our honeymoon trip to Hawaii!
5.0,Love it. It’s a cotton like fabric very stretchy and not thin or see through. It’s high waisted stops just below the knee on me. True to size
5.0,"Perfect for his workouts, slight compression in fit that he was looking for. Holds up in wash, also purchased in black"
5.0,"While these panties were somewhat small, they are beautifully feminine high quality panties. They are made of stretch cotton with lace cut high up on the legs. This makes for a fit that is nonbinding. They are exactly like pictured."
5.0,"Excellent item, shipping was fast, worked effectively"
5.0,"I decided to take a chance on these dresses and I'm so glad that I did!  As other customers have noted, they are *much* prettier in person!  They are soft and comfortable with a great, flattering fit.  I keep coming back to order more colors and prints!  :D"
5.0,"Just received them yesterday, very pretty and delicate earrings."
5.0,"My husband is an officer and I purchased these for him because he has issues with keeping his belt up. My husband has broad shoulders, trim waist and no butt. With that said keeping his duty belt up has been a struggle but never stopped him from working. A fellow officer had hip replacement and the doctor suggested these for him. After talking with that officer my husband asked me to purchase to see how they helped with his belt. He loves them and wear them with both uniform (Class B & C)."
5.0,"Great gift for a friend, they liked it"
5.0,"This tank is so cute! It's true to size and fits a little loosely in the front, convenient if you're trying to hide stomach fat like me.<br />The length is perfect for women with a long torso. It hangs just below my belt.<br />The color is a nice, bright red and the lace detail is beautifully done.<br />Material is good quality, super soft & comfortable! Stitching was even and perfect.<br />You may feel the need to hand wash because of the lace detail but I don't believe it's necessary. I washed mine on a regular warm cycle (inside out) and it came out looking as good as new.<br />This is a beautiful, high quality top. I highly recommend!"
5.0,The dress fits really well - i've gotten tons of compliments at work and casually!
5.0,"Got this for my Fiance for Christmas, honestly way better quality than I expected."
5.0,"I wear these at work in an emergency department, they are tough and easy to use."
5.0,"This bag worked perfectly as a carryon for my 13&#34; macbook pro, kindle, small notebook, phone, wallet, and water bottle."
5.0,These leggings are absolutely perfect. They are not only flattering but also provide the compression I want for my workouts. I’m 5’9/170 lbs and the large fit perfectly. They are squat proof and super comfy. The only small disappointment was the moisture-wicking. It does show sweat slightly. But that doesn’t really bother me. Customer service seems great. They really stand behind their leggings. I will 100% be ordering these in more colors!
5.0,My niece loves them
5.0,Ive been using this satchel for a while now and it is very very nice. I would recommend this to anyone.
5.0,"I love this, it is well made, the watch actually works, it is the perfect little vintage accessory for any occasion. I would recommend it. :)"

5.0,"Great price, fast delivery."

5.0,"Very pretty Spring hat, nicely made, delivered promptly, well protected in a box for the transit . I like the color and the design.<br />I added a few rhinestones on the veil, as  I was wearing it to a formal evening affair , and it looked elegant with a pink chiffon scarf and a black<br />long dress . Nice price, too !"

5.0,I love my prayer shawl...
5.0,"My girlfriend looks great in this dress! I mean, it’s my girlfriend,so I’m a bit bias and think she looks great in anything but this dress fits her perfectly! And I didn’t even have to send it back for a new size! Fit exactly as expected! #winning"
5.0,This dress is beautiful and well made. I ordered it in silver and it is just like the picture. I wear a size 12 so I ordered a large and it fit perfectly with a little room in the stomach area. I am going to order another one in black. I love the dress just that much.
5.0,"A little tight in the mid-section, maybe just because I'm chubbier there than I thought! Otherwise, I love the dress. I'm 5'9 and it reaches the top of my feet when I'm flat footed. Probably won't wear heels with it."
5.0,Great fit for my small wrist and is very comfortable. Also have the black band is as great.
5.0,These do not slide or move at all when placed. I love mine.

5.0,Love these! Will order in different color.
5.0,Very cute! Fast shipping.
5.0,"Due to age and a couple of surgeries, I have great difficulty finding a swim suit that covers AND flatters me.  This suit gives great coverage and stylish curves.  I am 5'5"", 180lbs and wasn't sure which size to buy;  so I purchased the 2XL - 18 plus .  It is a bit loose yet not too much, but I may buy the 16 Plus for next summer.  Overall I am very happy with this suit."
5.0,Easy to  use  great materials
5.0,"This is the very first time I have purchased a matching pearl necklace and earring set and the earrings are as lovely as the necklace. My son took my out for Mothers Day,  I wore the set with a black sequin top and I received so many compliments. Bold pearl jewelry is having a moment and I am here for it. I plan to purchase more pieces from SP Sophia Collection."
5.0,"I bought this necklace as a surprise. It came well packaged, very clean, and very sturdy, and It was a great price! I'll be ordering more!"
5.0,Fantastic support! I never felt my shin splint during a two mile fast paced walk. Normally they would have kicked in at about the 1/4 mile mark. Since this purchase I even purchased a second pair in hot pink 💕
5.0,These are excellent hearing protection.  I use them at my gym where they blast music over the sound system and I cannot hear anything with these on.  These are very good.
5.0,"This is a very classy looking dress, perfect for so many occasions.  I've gained some pounds recently (thanks ice cream) and it sucked everything in while accentuating some of the good points I still have under my fat haha.  For reference, I am 5'4, now 165 pounds and I ordered the large."
5.0,this item was awesome and great for the cost!
5.0,Husband was so happy to get these as a bday present. They were priced well too.

5.0,"A gift for my wife, who wears little jewelry, and she was very pleased to have these, indeed."
5.0,Cute pink underwear. The material is soft and they fit as expected. I like them but don’t recommend for heavy flow days. These are more for lighter days.
5.0,I think this is the one thing I would bye for everyone
5.0,I bought this as a gift and my friend loves it.
5.0,"This is better than I expected! Good fabric, good quality, good fit, very cute!"
5.0,"I'm 5'1 at 148lbs and I ordered a MEDIUM. I have a little tummy and if I suck it in, I look great in this dress. I may have to wear  spanks so none of my little fat will show because the dress hugs a bit, but it's not super tight. It gives just a little bit, but it's flattering on the body! I love the sleeves. The color I ordered was just a tab bit lighter than the burgundy color appears on line.  I will order another one in another color. The material is solid and a little see thru;  I tried it on wearing a leopard print bra and I could see the bra print a little, so I'll be wearing a black bra with this dress."
5.0,Buena correa
5.0,These are beautiful! Thank you!
5.0,"So I used this tie to cosplay a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts. It does bot have the house crest on it, however you wouldn't know the difference. Its the perfect color, the material is GREAT. Its a legit tie."
5.0,It's a really nice necklace its white tho!!!
5.0,The keychain was well packaged. The quality is good and the print is nice and legible. Very pleased. Thank you
5.0,I love this scrub cap style. I've brought others that just fit and my hair has to be laid down flat which is a pain. I have a lot of naturally poofy hair that fits perfectly. The material is lightweight and I don't sweat with it on. It has a sweatband inside which is nice if you are a person that sweats.
5.0,Inexpensive copy of Manolo Blanic Mary Jane.
5.0,Great---JB
5.0,"Love it!  Keeps my head warm at night, and limits hair breakage."
5.0,"Good for traveling, good for work/clinical bag as nurse/nursing student"
5.0,"This is absolutely my most favorite cosplay of all time. It was so last minute, but so worth it! The quality is great! It fits as expected. I ordered an XXL I believe. I've received so many compliments in the handful of times I've worn this costume. I will wear to her Premiere night at the movies! Thank you very much!"
5.0,"They have a nice tint on the lenses, the frames fit perfectly on me, and they serve their purpose, keeping the sun light down from my eyes."
5.0,"Hat is exactly as shown in pics, arrived in timeframe it was supposed to! Couldn't ask for more!"
5.0,I get lots of compliments on the purse.
5.0,Great item and good quality for the price.  Satisfies my teenage girl that wants piercings and the mother that said no.  Great compromise!!!
5.0,"Omg I love the way this jumpsuit feels on me and fits in 5'5 it's a lil long lol but I'm awesomely proportion small waisted, hips..thighs...dunk I bought all the rest of them lol jacket fits awesome to my chest size"
5.0,"I LOVE HOW THE QUALITY OF THIS DRESS IS SO GOOD!!! I am so happy I purchased this and put it on my baby soon as I got it to see how it fits and it is true to size/ the quality for its price is exceptionally good! I cannot believe that for this price it feels and looks like I had purchased a $50 dress for a baby. The details are so fine too! Overall, it is amazing and really nice! I recommend this to anyone!"
5.0,Excellent gear for a good price
5.0,Was looking for this exact type of glasses. We spend a lot of time on the water and I wanted glasses that would float if they fell off. Tested them in the tub and worked as expected.
5.0,"I have ordered (on several occasions) a total of 20 of these Dominican flag pins as gifts to friends there.  They arrive on time, carefully packaged, and in beautiful.  They are not inexpensive, but they aren't cheap, either--they are very substantial and presentable."
5.0,"I like the material-it's slightly thicker than some socks, giving it a secure comfortable feet to the feet. I bought this for my daughter who wears size 8 shoes so they are snug on her, so we will line dry them only. The art is so cute-a different egg pose to each pair of socks, and the yolk part has fuzzy material to distinguish it and make it cute! I definitely recommend these Gudetame socks for anyone who's young at heart"
5.0,This is a purse and they ask me about toe box arch support??????!
5.0,Absolutely love my new charm!  I was worried it was going to be too big but it looks nice and delicate on my bracelet.  I highly recommend for a RN to buy for herself or as a gift to a new grad or RN in your life.
5.0,Currently my favorite sunglasses! People compliment the wooden look a lot as well. Blocks out plenty of sunlight. Enough that I don't need my sun visor when commuting to work which is nice since my commute is almost directly east for an hour... The only downside that I had with them is some of the wood was sharp near the ears. It was easily fixed with some sanding and a nail file. I would recommend them if you're looking for something different but also just as effective as any pair of sunglasses.
5.0,Second dress in this style for this vendor I have purchased. Everywhere I go I receive compliments from men and women. It is effortlessly classy and super comfy!
5.0,Ladies!!! This dress will turn heads & the compliments will be flowing. Curves it the correct spots & you will shut it down!!!
5.0,"Now I finally understand &#34;Looking at life through rose colored glasses.&#34; Seriously, blues are purple reds are pink and everything is vivid...all without LSD! I get compliments galore and presently getting ready for a second pair, maybe darker."
5.0,"Great masks for those who have breathing issues. Not high on the protection scale, but better than nothing and will satisfy stores that have a mask policy."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e25c6ef0ec181673bf899b7cd3943171]] After you wash it it shrinks order one or 2 sizes up. I still love the shirt once I added a few custom touches
5.0,"OMG!!! I love this!! First off, I ordered this product  because I have bowed legs and I’m very self conscious about wearing tight fitting jeans or high boots. I had been searching for something like this and even tried custom making pads, but they were uncomfortable and slid down. After coming across this item, I decided to order. This is a perfect product to add a little more volume to your legs or even to fill out boots too!!<br /><br />First, I ordered this the week before Xmas, original shipping was estimated for after 1/8/18 but just arrived today 12/29... so fast shipping<br />2. The package is so cute!! It came in a beautiful purple box and bow.<br />3. The actual product is perfect, this is a silicone material but with a matte finish. I thought it would be like the silicone bra insert but I’m pleasantly surprised it’s not shiny.<br />4. The product is a perfect fit for my legs and covers from below the knee to just above my ankle.<br />5. Soft and light weight. The sticky side is not to “sticky” so it feels good when worn.<br />I’m sure with proper care it will last a decent amount of time, but I will definitely re-purchase again!!"
5.0,"Cute and comfortable summery dress or swimsuit coverup. Very crisp colors and I like that the neckline is higher than most dresses for something different. I like that it’s lined, so it both fits better and isn’t as see through.  I’m 5’6” and wear a 12/14 with a 36D. I ordered a large and it fits nicely with room to spare.  No complaints here at all."
5.0,"I wore this in the Dominican for days, no sunscreen and no sunburn. I don’t like sunscreen, it stinks, gunks up your skin and I always miss a spot. I saw people every day with a red splotch where they missed. My wife loves the shirt (it is bright orange); she always knows where I am."
5.0,Great love these
5.0,Bought using size wife told me to get. Too small and not enough time to replace for Christmas so I returned and bought local. It looked good quality.
5.0,Love it.  I've gotten numerous compliments.  Very good value.
5.0,Runs a size smaller. I ordered a large for a medium fit.
5.0,They can be a little too warm on some days.
5.0,Love this wear it alot
5.0,"My daughter loves this. Fit her so good and she looks amazing in it. Not a stretchy fabric, so be sure about your size."
5.0,"Used for a costume and they were perfect, but only good for fashion."
5.0,LOVED this dress! Wore it to a beach wedding with a kimono and got several compliments!
5.0,"I was initially a little put off by the price of this bag. It's a gym bag -- it's going to be filled with sweaty workout gear, do you really care about whether it's got a cute pattern or a shoe bag compartment or lined pockets, is that worth $50?? The answer is YES, yes you should care, and this bag pretty much speaks for itself. First of all, the pattern is amazing, I didn't think I cared that much about the outside but when I got this and opened the packaging, it really is beautiful, and very durable (it feels thick and resistant). LOVE the shoe compartment, it's nice to not have to worry if your shoes happen to get wet while walking to the car or into the gym, they won't soil the rest of your clothes when you put them back in the bag later. There are lots of little pockets inside too, which is nice to store toiletries, hair products, even balled-up socks. The pocket on the outside is lined, which is meant for media I'm sure, but I use it as a place to put my jewelry, and it gives me small peace of mind to know it's in a safe compartment that won't damage anything, and separate from my clothes so it doesn't get tangled, or rip anything. The handles are magnetic, which didn't influence me much, but it's a nice alternative from the standard velcro that catches on everything. Honestly, if you're a regular gym goer (or even if you want to be and you need some motivation), THIS is the bag you want to be carrying!"
5.0,These earrings are beautiful. They are just as vibrant and colorful as in the picture very nice size and nice lightweight leather.  I’ve been looking for purple earrings and I’m so happy I purchased them. I definitely recommend these earrings.
5.0,Son-in-law was very happy with this. The quality seems good and it looks great on him.
5.0,"Looks just like in the picture, and so comfortable. Really pleased with thid dress."
5.0,I love my Memphis Basketball Jersey necklace with my name and number.
5.0,They are so cute. I was scared they weren’t going to fit bc they looked to small but they fit perfectly
5.0,Perfect summer scarf
5.0,Very flattering.  Hides any tummy flaws. Does have a very sexy busy line that I pin depending on where I where it too.  Can be dressed up or wear it with sandals.  Overall loved it.
5.0,"Love the lightweight fabric which is excellent for those hot southern days/nights, not see-thru, coordinates very well with many different color bottoms, good quality, no problems wrinkling if taken from the dryer soon after it has stopped, great neckline and great length which covers some of the bottom area. Would buy again with no extra thought."
5.0,"Light, wind blocking fabric and shed light rain. Has two pockets large enough for my iPhone 13 Pro Max. Fit is slim but fits me perfectly.  I have used these for snow shoe and cross country skiing. Alone I found them comfortable for those active uses in the 30 degree range. With long John’s underneath I used them into the ‘teens’. Looking forward to trail running and hiking with these in spring."
5.0,Got 2 of them and matched them with an other stackable ring. I love the diversity of them! Google quality too! Sometimes I don’t wear these rings for weeks and they don’t get dark like my other rings do if they’re just laying around unprotected.
5.0,"Item was delivered promptly & in excellent condition. Item also looked as described. The colours and quality are of satisfactory level, I am happy with my purchase, 😊"
5.0,This was for my husband. He really like the feel of it and the size is just right for him. I'll order another one
5.0,"I'm obsessed with these tops!  They're nice for work, around the house, working out, and sleeping in.  I have several in different colors.  I usually wear a 2x but will buy XL next time.  They run a tiny bit big around the arm holes.  However, they are super stretchy.  Amazon did suggest an XL and I didn't listen.  I still love them but an XL instead of my regular 2x would have been better.  The size difference isn't enough to make it look awkward though.  They're so comfortable! I'm definitely getting more when the price goes down again.  It is a simple sleeveless so I don't think I'm comfortable spending more than $20 and change."
5.0,Easy to travel with have some trouble getting them on but great value for the money
5.0,Beautiful color and feel.  Would recommend to friends and family.
5.0,Sunglasses are sturdy and feel well made!
5.0,"NO POCKETS<br />Worked well, then grew out of it...."

5.0,So far they have great quality and handle wear and tear really well.
5.0,Very nice phone & key holders.  Build quality seems to be good and sturdy.
5.0,"My husband coaches a travel baseball team and for their birthdays this year, we bought each boy jerseys of their favorite players. We've purchased 2 Altuve jerseys and they've both been better than expected! Fits true to size!"
5.0,I bought this for a vacation. It fits true to size and is super comfortable. The length is perfect just a bit below the knee.
5.0,This shirt is very good looking and comfortable.  Came just in time for the Fall.  Would consider ordering more<br />from this company in the future.
5.0,Fit well and held up a few weeks of outdoor work. waterproof up to the wrists.
5.0,"I love that they come with a case to protect them from getting scratched up.  Perfect for my 6-year-old and he can use them for a couple years (if they make it that long). Quality-wise, no issues with the ones we received. For the people reviewing these based on longevity, let's remember they are kids sunglasses and they're not made Kevlar. Don't expect them to withstand abuse or negligence. For the price, they're fine."
5.0,"Absolutely love this shirt. It fits perfectly and looks very professional. The color came as more of a blue than a seafoam green, like it looks in the picture."
5.0,"Love, Love my new BLACK TURTLEFUR MERINO WOOL HAT !!<br />it feels so nice & soft inside & soooo warm & comfortable!!!<br />5 STAR QUALITY 100%<br />Lyn Grimmig, Memphis TN"
5.0,"Needed this for a couple of slide pendants.  It was a bit wider than expected, but the quality and style worked nonetheless."
5.0,"I am in love ,nice, perfect time delivery,I am happy to do business with you."
5.0,The white is smaller than the white but both fit well. Very sturdy bracelets.
5.0,They were what I was looking for in terms of easy to wear and care.  You can easily dress them up with accessories or wear them as is for around the house.  Not so flattering at my age but it is apart of aging.
5.0,Excellent quality for the money.  I purchased 14 for the seniors on my daughters swim team and was worried they might look cheap.  But they are really nice.  Go for it!
5.0,"My daughter is 6, but REALLY tall for her age.  We got size 8-9 and they fit her well with some room to grow into.  They're thicker than expected, incredibly soft and are her new favorite pants."
5.0,It completed my outfit for a party I was going to. They shaped my face good. They don’t feel fake and cheap. I love them!!
5.0,I bought these for teachers gifts and they all loved them!  Beautiful necklace!
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous dress!!!
5.0,"Love this set! Sexy, sweet, & very pretty! Accurately depicted as shown. Don't forget to get thigh-highs! I've fallen in love with Avidlove lingerie!! Their free returns make it convenient to purchase items and try them on to see if you like the fit and style on your particular body. ((Don't forget to please keep your underwear on while trying on, for sanitary reasons.)) I'm 5'2&#34; & 120 lbs. and the size Small fit me nicely."
5.0,These are beautiful quality pearls.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
5.0,This long sleeve is so soft and comfy great pullover for going to the gym. Will definitely be purchasing another color!
5.0,Gave as a Christmas gift to my mother. She loves red & rose gold. Was beautiful in person and she loved it!
5.0,This nursing / sleep bra is very  comfortable.  The material is very soft and stretchy which is probably why it even fits.  I got the f/g but am a G normally so I would recommend in that situation to go up in size if possible.  But it sill is comfortable and more support than no bra.  It's easy to nurse while wearing.
5.0,Bought for wife and they work really well for blocking out the sun as expected for a pair of polarized sunglasses. They look fashionable but feel cheaply made. The wife likes them and the price is good! Be careful to not drop or sit on them I'm sure they would break instantly! But good thing is they are cheap so if they did break they could be easily replaced.
5.0,I am absolutely in love with this shirt! It  fits great and looks amazing. It's a little think so I recommend a tank or cami underneath.
5.0,"Great dress, super comfy!"
5.0,"Did a 3 casino run yesterday. After the second casino, I used it. Then in last casino used it again. Spent the last of my loose cash and had to leave. Would have spent at least $100 more if I didn't have the safe with me. It already paid for it self in the first trip. Thanks"
5.0,Ordered for my daughter who can only wear studs during nursing school - they are really cute and seem to be good quality for the price.
5.0,Love these very soft and stay in place no riding up...
5.0,"Very cute shirt! Great quality, not flimsy material."
5.0,"Cute. Hasn't chipped or broken yet, but I wear it infrequently. It's a little big for my nose, but nothing a pair of pliers can't fix. I've gotten lots of compliments on it, and everyone I've run into with it on thought it was real. I'm also allergic to nickel, and while, like I said, I don't wear it often, when I do, it hasn't made my nose itchy or swell up."
5.0,Great fitting shirt. Loved the material
5.0,"These worked great for my Halloween costume and plan to use them again on the holidays :) I am around a size 4-6 130lbs currently and they fit great, a little tight on my upper thighs but also they stayed in place and didn’t slide down. They are thinner than socks but thicker than tights."
5.0,"This will look HUGE at first, but once it is washed and dried, it fits perfectly. :) Very cute!!"
5.0,So cute!! Definitely worth the money!
5.0,Very flattering and comfortable too!
5.0,Works great on cold nights camping. Still room to breathe.

5.0,"Ordered this for my friends birthday, it's perfect! Exactly as pictured! She is going to love it! Also came faster than expected!"
5.0,These glasses fit very well.  The adjustable temples make getting a good fit a snap.  Magnification is very good  Hopefully I won't get to test their impact resistance.  Glasses came on time and were well packaged.
5.0,Very stylish and classy
5.0,I have been wear Russell atheletic sweatshirt all my life and<br />always fond warm and comfortable feeling.
5.0,Good workout shirt. Lots of compliments wherever I go. Good quality.

5.0,Gave this to my grandma and she’s so comfy having it at night. The cloth is so soft! Worth the money by not breaking the bank!
5.0,Timely...product as expected
5.0,I got this for Halloween this year and haven’t worn it yet but I absolutely love it !!! My mom and I are embellishing it with a little more fabric to add dimension but it fits like a glove. I’m going as Ariel  🧜🏻‍♀️ And will keep as a cosplay piece. I can’t rememver if I got a 2 or a 4 but I’m 5’4 110 lbs if that helps and I think they are cut big so was great but I can’t gain any weight or I’d be in trouble lol Hope this helps x
5.0,Love this top!  The fabric is so soft and the color is gorgeous.  Shipping was fast and the seller included a nice note that made me feel like a person  and not just a number.  I'll be ordering more of these!

5.0,Very nice and comfortable. Exactly what I expected.
5.0,I needed a chain that was a bit more thick for a small charm
5.0,Son espectaculares
5.0,I love love & love this necklace
5.0,This is a beautiful dress that is well mad. I find that it runs a tad bit big. I usually wear an 8 but the 6 fit best. It's really flattering and I got so many compliments on it. It truly made feel beautiful.
5.0,"Great product, but returned for a different color."
5.0,"My daughter wanted a Lilo and stitch bday party, this was perfect! She loved it"

5.0,I Love these!!!! They are so comfortable and look nice too.
5.0,Wife loved it. Classy for the price
5.0,Very nice quality. Stitching is straight and the leather is supple. With use should gain a nice petina. Fit is very true to the amazon size guide.
5.0,I've tried the off-brand imports. They shrink and fall apart quickly. Hav-A-Hanks are the go-to best. I've buying them since the 80's!.
5.0,"Stylish; well made. Great for travel. Room for cell phone, cash, coins, and credit cards. Crossbody design."
5.0,Love this earrings! I been having them for a year now and they still look great. Great purchase.
5.0,I have very small wrists and never can find bracelets that fit. This company offers different sizes which most don't so I ordered the 6.75 inch. They fit great and are beautiful and excellent quality. They even come with extra string incase you need to adjust size. I highly recommend.
5.0,I READ THE REVEIWS AND GOT THE PERFECT SIZE IT IS CUT SMALL I NORMALY WEAR A 14 GOT A XXL AND I LOVE THE WAY IT FITS
5.0,"Shirt is of heavy quality, this is not a lame excuse, far from a overseas product. Shipped within 2 days, packaged correct."
5.0,"Love these! I'm an avid snorkler/free diver and I needed fingerless gloves for sun protection while snorkeling. Even with sunscreen, my hands sunburn badly if I'm in the water a lot, and many Caribbean islands won't let you wear full gloves (they are afraid you'll touch the corals if you wear full gloves). These are marvelous! Comfortable, and they dried quickly, and my hands didn't get sunburned, but I did wear sunscreen on under them as a precaution and on my exposed fingers. The only problem - I lost them the last day of the trip when the wind blew them out of the boat (always leave them in your bag until ready to put them on). So I had to buy another pair, which I did. Wonderful!"
5.0,very nice front wallet it is what I was looking for. nice strong magnetic. will order again when needed.
5.0,"Great item, fast shipping. Thanks!"
5.0,"This bag is beautiful! I love the colors ! I chose grey because I like the patch of wine color in the front . The pics on Amazon are a true representation of the actual bag . Unlike many PU leather bags , this one actually looks real because of the texture on it . It's heavier than I'd like , but I expected it to be . I love the shape , and the fact that it's all one compartment . That way , I can carry all my stuff in smaller bags and just get the smaller bag out , instead of digging through compartments trying to find my stuff . The bag is fairly stiff and holds its shape well . I hate digging through a floppy bag trying to find stuff . The front and back pockets are best for flat items , such as a pay check or other important small papers . If you were to put round items in those pockets , it would ruin the shape of them over time . It doesn't have an odor . Seems very well made . I'm going to add some pics to show the texture and how I can fit my iPad mini , 8x11 notebook, and overfilled wallet inside with lots of room to spare . I looked for one that was all PU leather without the faux snake skin , but couldn't find one . That's the only thing I'd change about the bag . I'm picky about handbags . I always want one with the perfect size , shape , color , weight . I can never find ones I like in my area . I'm so glad I found this at such a steal ($25 ) on Amazon . I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has . I know it's hard to shop online for a handbag cuz you can't see it and get a true feel for the size , shape , weight ...etc."
5.0,"Cute, comfortable and a great classic bootie."
5.0,Perfect for training
5.0,I love it  it fitss very well and looks very sexy
5.0,"LOVE! Good quality fabric, padded boob area lol. No weird smell. Looks good, fits precisely. Comfortable. I’m a 34B and got a small. Ignore my deodorant stains >&lt;"
5.0,"I had my doubts, but this is really cute. Not fuzzy on the inside, but lightweight and comfortable. The pattern looks cheap out of the package, but looks so nice on. Great casual top."
5.0,Awesome hat my husband wears it everyday.  Thank you for your service
5.0,"These are exactly what I wanted in a compression tight.  Sucks everything in, without being crazy tight or inflexible.  It has 2 pockets on the side - great for a big phone, even.  Super high waist (I like it high, and this totally fits the bill), so even when you're doing squats, you're still completely covered.  Feels very durable and like it will tolerate a lot of washing - nice and thick.  I bought one and then bought another, once I saw how great it fit.  I also tried a very expensive ($80) pair of Spanx tights, and MUCH prefer these on every front! Highly recommend! BTW, I'm 5'8"" and 200 lbs and the large fit me perfectly."
5.0,"I love these! Admittedly I haven’t worn them a lot yet, so I’m not sure how durable they are yet. They’re so flattering!"
5.0,"I gave it to my 13 year old for Christmas and his eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. He couldn't thank me enough and he wears it daily. I have to admit, if your child has a specific character he/she like, that's the best gift to give. He uses it as his school id holder and his house keys. Guarantee, he will not lose either one.<br /><br />Highly recommend A+A+A+A+A+"
5.0,I love the color and the sturdiness of this case! It also comes with a eye glasses repair tool.
5.0,"Perfect fit. BEAUTIFUL bright image, good quality."
5.0,Love these. Glad I brought several.

5.0,Love Love Love these pants!
5.0,Excellent purchase
5.0,"I like this dress! My friends all said it is very cute on me. The quality is very good, it’s a little stretch. The color stayed same after wash several times. Great!"
5.0,"My daughter loved these shirts, a little thin but still great"
5.0,"I ordered two of the 18"" silver box chains.  First, they arrived in record time (I ordered from Gem Avenue) and each were packaged securely and boxed separately. The chains are exactly what I was hoping to receive.  They are sturdy without looking cheap (and actuallly look very expensive).  They hang nicely and the clasp looks well made.  I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the ""box"" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it's the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I'm very pleased with both the quality and the price.  I tried to get the same kind of chain at our local department store and it was twice as much.  You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,"This looks so nice and expensive in person.  What a great peice of jewlry.  This is so fierce and it so light, it's not heavy at all."
5.0,Good go to top. I am tall and have long arms and it was perfect length.
5.0,I love my new socks. very nice color
5.0,"Bought this for a friend who is definitely an MCR fan, came in great shape and is by far his favorite belt."
5.0,Love them!! So cute and different styles for a great price!! Came packaged nice and can't wait to wear one this weekend for a friends wedding!!!
5.0,"Our 9  year old daughter loves this hoodie, along with her my little pony hoodie she is usually in one or the other. She loves the fit, says it is comfortable, and it's already lasted well under several washes. Highly recommended."
5.0,Love the Tallit I order from here. I have ordered numerous ones and never a problem with shipping or quality. Can't go wrong with these.
5.0,"Love these. Comfortable fit, nice material."
5.0,I just love these earrings they are not too heavy very pretty and I'm always getting compliments on them
5.0,Absolutely love this dress!!! I have bigger arms so I was worried a small wouldnt fit but I was PERFECT!!! I’m 140lbs
5.0,"Absolutely loved the outfit! A little too big, but it works. She's 17 months, but tiny."
5.0,Comfortable pretty
5.0,For the price the quality of the product was great. The product snaps tightly onto both my controller and my Samsung Note 9 and even held on when I accidentally dropped it a few times. I have been using one for over a month and show no signs of wear and still functions properly.
5.0,Bought it as a gift...he loved it! The blue color really picks up in the light and the comfort fit is nice for him.
5.0,"Ordered for my teen daughter, and she loves it.  Not to tight and not loose.<br />Would buy again!"
5.0,"I bought this as a honeymoon bathing suit and it went over very well with the wife. Comfortable, not too constrictive (but it is fitted, so there was some constriction), looks great, feels great. One zipper pocket is almost useless. A head turner.<br />(typically wear 33 waist and I got a US medium and it was perfect)"
5.0,"I've gotten so many compliments on these shoes. They are suuuper tall, I'm between 5'5 and 5'6, and these shoes make me nearly as tall as my 6' tall brother. So if you aren't prepared for some height, then I don't recommend these. I bought these a half size bigger than my normal flat size, and a full size bigger than my normal heel size, and so, as I expected, they fit a bit large. I recommend those who are between sizes go with the smaller one, though, as I got another pair in an 8 and they still had a bit of room. And they are super hard to walk in at first."
5.0,"Me encanto , original y bordado!"
5.0,"I bought two for my adult sons who have big heads. The material is like a soft, stretchy tshirt but it is doubled. Great for days when it is not very cold"
5.0,Very well made for the price
5.0,I am 5'5&#34; and 125 lb. The shirt fits great. It hangs off my shoulders slightly at the shoulder seam. It. Is a nice flannel type material. It is a burgundy with ivory stripe color. It looks just like the model in the photo. It is warm and comfortable.

5.0,"Perfect for my post partum belly! It fits as expected, so order the size you normally order."
5.0,"My husband ""eats"" these. We can never find them when we need them. So, buying them in bulk has been great. And that makes it much more economical as well. He has some vision issues so this style and the polarized brown are imperative for him to have to drive safely."
5.0,Love this purchase
5.0,Love the extended links for larger wrist size.
5.0,Material is so comfortable but be sure to hand wash. It fit as expected for me
5.0,"I just the bracelet, looks & feels amazing, and for the price I paid it, you can't go wrong with it. It's exactly like the picture."
5.0,"Love this top very cute and love the thin material,  but it runs small i am 5'8 130lbs flat chest 34A and a small one was too tight but I also like my tops a little loose, it is a good length.<br /> so the small one there's really no place to move your arms unless u don't close the lace but very cute over all, will definitely order a large one"
5.0,Love the price.<br />My kids love them.
5.0,"They fit my 9yo perfectly. Great quality, truly polarized. The screwdriver is adorable and very handy. The case is well made too. We are happy with this purchase."

5.0,Fits great by it self or on top a shirt.
5.0,"Better than I expected. Extremely comfortable and being titanium, it’s light on your wrist. This Tudor Pelagos keeps better time than my Rolex. I used to think that Tudor was just a baby Rolex, but I think Rolex needs to be schooled by the people at Tudor."
5.0,"I bought these for my mom originally for Christmas she has been battling cancer and had a rough couple of days.  So I wrapped them up and gave them to her early to help cheer her up and give her some sunshine.  These certainly shined and my mom loves them.  It brighten up her day, increased her spirits.  The number of leaves matched the number of children and grandchildren, of course we can not leave out her 3 cats or the labradoodle that is from her first born grandchild.  She put them on and went outside.  The sun was shinnng and the way the sunlight hit the earrings they had a excellent sparkle and shine to them.  Very eye catching that my husband noticed right away and loved them.  Thank you VeraVida for making such a wonderful set of earrings,  they are beautiful and made my mom feel very special because it did not have anything to do wth a holiday.or any other special past occasion.  I would definitely order these again.<br />again!"

5.0,This dress is vibrant and pretty.  It fits as expected.  I am 5 ft and weigh 160 so I ordered XL to make sure it would be loose.  So soft and stretchy and oh so comfortable.  I will definitely order more.

5.0,Excellent neckline for jewelry.
5.0,"I'm 5' 4"", weigh 115 lbs, and ordered a yellow-patterned small.<br />This is a beautiful dress and I received so many compliments while wearing it! It was a little large in the waist but that is pretty normal for me. I easily fixed it with some safety pins and none were the wiser. The dress is made of a lightweight material so it flows enchantingly when you walk. The length was perfect for walking in sandals without tripping over the fabric. I can't say enough about this dress!"
5.0,These red shoes are pure perfection! And at this price I just knew they would hurt...WRONG! I love them and will buy other colors.
5.0,Amazing I used everyday for my work thanks. It's great to have this for all hard works thank you very much

5.0,"These Ryka shoes not only look great, they feel great. The fit was as expected, I ordered my regular size and they fit. I bought them in blue, but they also come in a pretty red."
5.0,"I have been looking for a multipurpose purse, diaper bag and work bag for a long time.  In my search I was looking for something fashionable and sturdy.  I came across the Diophy purses online and fell in love with the faux leather bag because of the size; this bag can hold a ton of stuff! I can carry my work stuff I need daily as well as diapers, wipes and all other personal items I need.  I love that there is a smaller bag that fits inside of the larger bag.  I have made the smaller bag my actual purse and then I use the larger part of the bag for my extra stuff.  The smaller bag has several pockets on the inside for your phone or change which is great for organization.  There is a large zipper pocket on the front of the large back that I put my phone in and it’s super convenient.  I love when I go in to a store I can grab the smaller purse out and attach the long strap that comes with the bag to it and use it as a cross body purse and not have to carry a large bag around for small trips.  I think this purse is going to now be my go to bag; the space and the design make it so functional for a busy woman on the go.  I’m very pleased with this bag.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are based solely on my own personal experience with this product."
5.0,Order arrived before it was scheduled to and bracelet came in a decorative gift box just like expected. Seems like a quality item and well made. I may buy one for myself.
5.0,Good fit and lots of pockets to put things. These are nice shorts.
5.0,great color well made
5.0,Really like the colors.  It's a modified cotton shirt... Great for casual day outfit.
5.0,Cute shirts for the price and the fit was great for my 1 year. He is almost 29 lbs and 33in long. I purchased the 2t.
5.0,"I got a 2XL because the reviews said they ran small, I think I will get the large or XL next time. Great material, I love the shirt overall."
5.0,Got these for my adult son a month ago. They’ve held up just fine so far. He loves them and wears them very often. They fit well and says they’re soft and comfortable.
5.0,"Highly recommend this bib -it’s so cute , made well - , when the bib was given , the mom to be , had the biggest smile on her face .  Money well spent !"
5.0,So Cute
5.0,"For those of us graced with a larger head, these sun glasses fit really well and don't look small on my face. I prefer yellow tinted, polarized lenses and this is exactly what these glasses delivers."
5.0,Very comfortable. And I love how soft it feel. I am currently pregnant it is very important the elastic is stretchy and the waistband on this pants would too tight at all.
5.0,Love it! It's beautiful and adjustable. Makes me want to get my nose pierced for real!
5.0,happy with my purchase
5.0,Glasses look and fit just great.  They are a great price.  I forgot my normal blue-light blocking readers so I ordered these to fill in  Will continue using these in a pinch
5.0,"Very cute! A bit smaller than I expected. They didn't come with backstops, so I had to borrow a few from another pair of earrings."
5.0,This is the cutest little purse! It's pretty well made for the price. Not a purse that I would use every day but good for a lunch out with friends.
5.0,"Fabric seems sturdy, fit midsection perfectly, arms and legs were a little snug but I'm also a big girl 260 (lbs)"
5.0,It meet my expectations
5.0,"Cool punk rock looking spiked earrings. Look like they’d feel heavier than they are, and they are a full wrap look all the way to the back of the love. The closure on one was a little snugger than I expected, but was able to get released with assistance."
5.0,"This is a great product!  So much better than the silk type that press on your eyes.  These are very soft and comfortable even for a side sleeper.  I must have it dark when I sleep and often go traveling with others who must have night lights, so this will certainly do the trick for me. I checked a lot of sites and was delighted to find two pair, with earplugs and separate travel bags for what one often costs.  Think this will be great for airplanes, too.  And I also love the special Velcro which doesn't get caught in your hair!  I received my order two days before the date they told me it would arrive."
5.0,i like it a lot!! it is see thru but i only got it to layer so it doesent bother me.
5.0,"Ordered a 10/12 based on size chart and it fits perfectly. Out of all the different kinds I have ordered, my daughter says these are her favorite. I’m now ordering the other color set. Product was shipped 2nd day air so they arrived quickly. The quality feels really good."
5.0,This wrap is now my favorite! The size is just as I wanted. I'm 5'6&#34; tall and I wear size 22 so I needed a large wrap. If you're below a size 16 then I think this wrap would probably too big for you.
5.0,Looks better in person. Smaller than expected but in a good way. Great for the price
5.0,second pair and quality is great! overall a great slip on and color is much more vibrant than seen here. Kids love them!
5.0,My daughter loves it! It fits great and is super cute!
5.0,I loved them a  whole lot!!
5.0,"So colorful, just love the feel. Have received many compliments. They haven’t shrunk nor faded after many washing’s."
5.0,Love the color and the fabric. Super comfy. Must wear a tank underneath because of the low cut but it's a wardrobe staple.
5.0,"This little silver necklace shaped like a heart with her initial on it was one of the prettiest gifts we gave our granddaughter.  She asked for it, and we loved it.  It is so delicate and was perfect for our 9 year old."
5.0,As I've aged I don't have the strength in my hands to rack my Pistol. The Handi-Rack solved my problem.
5.0,adorable at christmas
5.0,These are the best leggings you can buy! Makes me look skinnier too lol
5.0,"Fits as advertised, nice light but strong material. Exactly what I was hoping for."
5.0,"I purchased this dress in black w/white dots and navy w/white dots. Once again I read reviews before purchasing and first purchased the black w/white dots in a large. I'm 5'6&#34; and around 200lbs. The dress was a little tight on my breast area and looked a bit awkward. It's such a cute dress, that didn't stop me from wearing it. I then purchased the navy w/white dots in XL. It fit perfectly (including my breast area) and I loved wearing it with some cute white Keds sneakers. I'd highly recommend either dress."
5.0,Well made for such a low price. Looks great!
5.0,"True to size. Very comfortable, always my go to shoe for work or dressing up."
5.0,I love these socks.  They are so comfortable!  I am going to order more.
5.0,"They were a little longer as far as length and a tad big, but are absolutely by far the most comfortable underwear! The material is breathable and doesn't give horrific panty lines. Love that they also have the dark option so they do not show stains of any sort."
5.0,It’s a fun costume piece. Packaged very carefully
5.0,Very Happy!
5.0,Love love love! I got these in 3 different colors. I am a size 12 and ended up ordering a Large like the size chart says but I wanted them more comfortable since I’m also very curvy. I reorder in XL and it was perfect for me! I am also short 5’1 and the band on the bottom helps it not be too long. I hope this review helps someone. I usually don’t write reviews.
5.0,Perfect for a pirate costume!
5.0,This product is so easy to wear and i goes with everything!!!!! I wear it pretty much everywhere and i am hooked and keep wanting to order more!!!
5.0,These glasses are perfect for my cosplays. They fit comfortably and they look so cute! Delivery was quick as well.
5.0,This dress looks even better in person! We ordered this as a last minute dress to a formal snow dance and my daughter was more than pleased! She's 5' 5'' and about 160 and we ordered a large.

5.0,Its fit wonderful😍skirt is stretchy top fit just right fits well on me I recommend this outfit
5.0,This is the most feminine wallet chain ever! I love it.
5.0,"I'm 150lbs, 36d, 5'6""...this dress fits like it was made for me. It is long and definitely needs to be worn with 3 inch heels or it will drag too much. The fabric is a nice polyester type feel. It's not thin at all. This is a really well made dress. Incredible for only $44. This would easily cost $200-300 here in US. The shipping was very quick. It does come from China. Mine was shipped by DHL. Truly a jaw dropping my beautiful dress. No hesitation recommending this. You may need to steam the ruffle at the bottom. Will add pictures later."
5.0,My brother used this for his wedding day.  He was very pleased with color and quality.

5.0,I love the material and it fits perfectly and very speedy delivery.
5.0,"This is a nice product for the price. Not too thin, but good quick-dry, breathable fabric and the mesh vents are a really nice addition. And, the size is good as well."

5.0,Perfect snow pants... exactly as described!

5.0,"Unlike the other pin I bought, this one came with all parts. The green peridot one was missing the backing when I ordered it. I am really excited about using this since I plan on using it for my wedding! They are really pretty when they come in and I don't feel the picture does it justice!"

5.0,"I now wear these every time I go outside.  They work well and although they sometimes bump against my nose, for the money they do the job."
5.0,"The his is a great take anything you throw at it medical ID. When I first received it I throw it  on the concrete outside my place to see if it would last. I’ve had one on my previous dog tag that was lost in the ocean so I already knew where to get the second one. I got it laser etched in town and it has survived multiple mud runs, dives in caves down to about 60ft and my weekly cycling and jogging routine. In fact I my just buy another one to have on standby as a just in case."
5.0,"Just love the shirt. The quality of material, and the twist with the polka dot accents at the collar and cuffs makes this an extra special winner! Got lots of compliments on it."

5.0,These boots are hot!  You might want to put a band aid above your heal for it rubs a bit or wear thick socks.
5.0,Lovely light weight Merino Wool Scarf.  Beautiful vibrant colors.  Very soft.
5.0,These really add a touch of pizazz to my jackets - and makes the zippers a lot easier to work with.
5.0,"Great hat, great price"
5.0,Was for a gift and the recipient was very pleased.
5.0,Best Sunglasses I ever had.  They fit the face very well.  Only thing is that they are slightly fragile
5.0,"This band has lasted beyond expectation. I wear it everyday and I have had it about 9 months, the color has dulled a little bit but in Texas heat you can't expect for it not to."
5.0,"This turned out perfect. Soft and great quality, accurate sizing! Not to mention absolutely adorable! :)"
5.0,"The quality and value of this chain are really nice. It was certainly worth the money.<br />The clasp takes some getting used to. However, once you figure it out, you'll feel sure that the clasp won't open up on you."
5.0,"Seems very steady, solid and best of all no metal parts as I am allergic to certain metals and most bands with metal clasps cause a skin  reaction that is unpleasant, BUT this band is awesome, since it contains No metal hardware that rub against my skin.<br /><br />Also surprised by how strong the magnetic hold is, it appears very firm and strong.<br /><br />For people with a skin condition such as myself, this is perfect!"
5.0,Receive complement every time I wear it. Love the elastic band to hold light weight hat on in a breeze.
5.0,Really cute and nicely made! My granddaughter loves them!!!!
5.0,Absolutely love it. For my job i am often on a ladder outside and in the winter this keeps my head warm and allows me to answer phone calls from people in other areas of the job site or listen to music without digging for my phone in my pocket.
5.0,Love that. Absolutely perfect
5.0,Super cute and sturdy<br />I drawback - case runs small.  I gave it to my little cousin
5.0,We loved the guitar strap.  It exceeded our expectations!  Looks as if the heat transfer is on there very secure.  Loved the bright colors.
5.0,"This is a very attractive purse, roomy and well made. It is a rich dark brown and the silver accents look so pretty. I am very happy with this purchase, may get another color I like it so much. Good price too!"
5.0,Comfortable and perfect for summer.
5.0,Great hats. Soft and flexible but snazzy looking
5.0,Fun bling for a great price
5.0,"this robe is super comfortable and long-lasting, great for the price. i know you're supposed to wear these after a shower/bath, but i use it to lounge in as well. despite having some strands sticking out because of my cat's random playful attacks, this robe will definitely last quite some time."
5.0,"I have an LV purse that I didn't use often because the shoulder strap would constantly slide off my shoulder and I don't like to use bags with handles on an every day basis, especially when shopping, I end up putting it in my cart and risk theft. I ordered the small extenders and it turned my shoulder strap bag into a cross body.  Now instead of this bag sitting on a shelf in my closet its getting used like it should!  The quality of the faux gold appears good.  I just received them last week, so we'll see how they hold up with everyday use.  I am pleased and may turn my other handled LV bags in to cross bodies as well."
5.0,"Better quality than expected ... Heavier, not flimsy .... Rings run VERY small ... More like toe rings .... I have super-thin fingers, so I can wear them on ring finger 'tip' (above first joint)  and all the way down pinky ... (my normal ring finger size is a 5) .... These would make nice toe rings ... Bands are totally closed, NOT the pinch together type ... I intend to buy another set for my toes .... (I already have two toe rings and these seem to be the same sizes (about a 2-3)"
5.0,Great colors good quality
5.0,REALLY LIKE THIS SHIRT AND WILL BE ORERING ANOTHER ONE IN A DIFFERENT COLOR I WISH YALL HAD MORE OPTIONS TO BUY SIZE SMALL I LOVE YOUR BUTTON DOWN SHIRTS
5.0,Great for working out
5.0,Great stockings with just the right amount of support.  They stay up and are not too hard to put on.  I am on my feet 12 hours a day and these provide great support.
5.0,Sexy! But the shoulders do fall off sometimes. Had to be careful not to flash anyone while bending over! I used double sided tape to keep it on my shoulders though.
5.0,loved it and gifting to grand daughter
5.0,These compression stockings fit well and were comfortable for the 12 hours I had them on.
5.0,"I love this dress! I could have gone down one size I'm a 14/16 and ordered a Large, a medium would still fit my fullness and helped with the length. The large was long but I wore wedge sandals so it worked out."
5.0,"Love this underskirt. There are flexible hoops, and it is just the right length for me. I am short (5'3&#34;) and its hard to trust a one size fits all. However the skirt goes to my ankles, the waist has a adjustable velcro with strings to secure everything. The waist also has an elastic band that helps hold the skirt up. I would buy this again and reccomend it to friends."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.  Very impressive.  Love it!
5.0,"Beautiful cases, well made, open and close seamlessly. Ordered in black and in purple."
5.0,Can't be beat for the price
5.0,"Came sooner than expected. The material is also pretty stretchy and soft, softer than I thought it would be, so I'm happy about that (as someone who dislikes most materials). Would purchase another one. I was worried about the sizing but it ended up working out. I am 5 ft 4, roughly 120 lbs, and ordered a large. It is oversized like I wanted."
5.0,Great looking shower curtain. Fit my kids tub/shower perfectly and it looks great.
5.0,"Great design, sits very well.  It came a little wrinkled from the packaging, but, I just sprayed it with warm water and hung it out to dry and it released most of the wrinkles.  The blue is very pretty, more of royal blue than navy though.  Got lots of compliments on it."
5.0,"I bought this as a BD gift for a 5th grade girl.  It is a perfect blend of cute and sophisticated.  It easily goes over the shoulder for a no-hands bag.  Enough room for a phone, money, and a few personal items without becoming irritatingly heavy.  It was so cute, I bought another one when I needed to buy a gift."
5.0,was given as a gift and she loved it
5.0,I really LOVE my Yalice Vintage Quartz Healing Crystal Necklace Chain Pentacle Pendant! I highly recommend this seller to anyone!
5.0,"I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Very amazing quality with great compartments for any storage need. I truly wish I had bought this product while I was in high school, because it would have been better than my jansport bag and it would have lasted into my college years too. Huge plus? Who hates the Lion King?!"
5.0,"Very nice.  In fact exceptionally nice.<br />I received a coupon and thought I'd purchase the tote.<br />Very colorful, lots of pockets and very well made. Very sturdy.<br />Can be used for the beach or pool, and also would be a good &#34;picnic basket,&#34; for sandwiches, snacks and drinks.<br />Even would serve as a cute diaper bag for a new mom.<br />Well worth the price and has multi uses."
5.0,"Incredibly beautiful piece! I bought it as a gift and when I saw how gorgeous it was, I ordered another one for myself!"
5.0,"Came in great shape with no cosmetic defects, was shipped quickly and delivered on time. Great fit, snapped right on, and the wire, which came installed, provides good tension/turning friction without any need for adjustment. Changes the look of my Vostok amphibia scuba dude entirely, much sportier and nicer looking than the overly shiny chromed one that comes on the watch."
5.0,Good option to have. Made my son’s Halloween. Great fit.
5.0,I loved the fit. I wore it to my aunt's wedding
5.0,The wings fit well and will be fun to wear this Halloween!

5.0,its mid calf for me because im only 5feet but its a beautiful dress
5.0,"exactly as described, great product"
5.0,Got these as a gift and she loved them!
5.0,"These earrings are super nice for this price. I originally was going to buy the bat earrings from unique vintage for $28 dollars not including the shipping.  I was so happy I didn't buy those and got these because these are the exact same earrings for wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy cheaper. Great buy, very cute."
5.0,Looks just like the picture. My son likes them and they keep his feet warm.
5.0,Absolutely fell in love with these as soon as I saw them. Super fast delivery too. I would encourage you to try these and you'll see what I mean! They are so lightweight and sparkly I can't wait to show them off!
5.0,Look amazing came fast to thank you
5.0,These goggles were quite comfortable and fit well even on my smallish face. I really like the rubbery grip along the strap to keep it in place. Good ventilation asking the top. They look stylish too!
5.0,"so far after month and a half of 60hr work weeks on my feet, these insole are doing a very good job. No plantars faciitis flair ups, supportive arch and heel cup cradles back of my foot so not to put too much pressure on the heel. Well cushioned rear and fore foot, so far no compression of cushioning material."
5.0,"These are so pretty! Very dainty. Light weight. Good value for your money. I have wore them about 6 times since I bought them. Nice box and pouch. Giftable, they would love them."
5.0,"Just gave it to a friend of mine as a gift and they love it. Fits them great, they feel great in it and it seems to be made very well. Were both very happy definitely reccomend it."
5.0,They're actually very nice pieces of jewelry great for teenagers young adults  none of the jewelry pieces have fell out that's a bonus good buy for the price.
5.0,Lovely piece! My son loves this. Hold a tiny bit of ashes and the lid is screw top so thats nice and secure. It's well made for the money and has a nice weight to it.
5.0,I absolutely love this new field watch from BUREI. Very comfortable strap with leather inside and canvas outside is much more comfortable than plain canvas. The black dial adds a nice contrast and is very easy to read. The lume is very strong on the watch which is very nice is low light conditions. This also has a date function which works perfectly. It is 50m water resistance and I do wish it was at least 100m but it's not s deal breaker. The warranty is very solid. The presentation upon arrival was very good and came in a very nice display box. It is a mineral glass and so far has been easy to clean. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.
5.0,Nice everything it said it was and what I wanted.
5.0,"I love it. It is attractive, and looks far more expensive than it was."
5.0,Works good and my daughter can put them on herself
5.0,These socks are awesome. I received multiple compliments at the last local Scottish games. I have very large calves and they were still very comfortable. Great design.
5.0,"Beautiful dress, love it!"
5.0,works great.  fits great.
5.0,It’s so durable and very good quality!!! Have had it for over 2 years now
5.0,"These are beautiful and versatile. Got me some and then got more for my sister. I always feel cute, and get compliments with styling them. Soft, silk, sheen."
5.0,I immediately loved this dress when I saw it but was a little concerned how it would fit. The cut of this dress is perfect and very flattering.  I love the material and wore this dress all day to an event and it was so comfortable.
5.0,"Eeekk, my purse came today,  I have been wanting this purse for ever just to cheap to buy lol , but buying on here vs Macy's I saved $90.. i was extremely worried it would be fake but im pleased to say its very much real, and I'm obsessed.. a little bummed it didnt come with the protector bag but oh well."
5.0,"If you need working gloves thinner then leather but thick enough for protection, these gloves are perfect!  They are also warm and washable in a regular washing machine."
5.0,Buen diseño original
5.0,hubby loved it.. hes a huge Guinness fan :)
5.0,Very comfortable and had to buy another.
5.0,"Love these two-tone earrings! They fit perfectly and clip in easily. When they're on, they are so comfortable I forget I have them in."
5.0,"I can't even express how well this jacket fits, and the quality is top notch!  Excellent customer service, awesome product...will be recommending!"
5.0,Love love love these threader earrings!
5.0,cutesiest
5.0,The petite size was perfection!<br />Everyone complemented and loved my dress on my trip in Greece
5.0,They are awesome!  Perfect for a superhero day at work!!!
5.0,Hermosa no dejé  de recibir  cumplidos...
5.0,"What a great shirt, it fit well and was so cute"
5.0,"I love this bag.  For the price, it's fantastic.<br /><br />I really load mine up with a 15 in laptop (which just squeezes in) and tons of other stuff and I'm pretty rough with it but it's been holding up really well!  I know it's not going to last forever, the weak spot is the shoulder strap which will definitely be the first to go. The bag looks super professional and I love that I don't have to worry about scratching it or getting it dirty because it was relatively inexpensive.  If the shoulder strap broke tomorrow I would probably buy the same bag again."
5.0,Super cute and quirky. I get compliments every time I wear them!
5.0,Flashy and comfy!! Bought these for a concert and was not disappointed.
5.0,I got this to help maintain our Article leather sofa and it works great. Was able to use it to scrub out crayon that my toddler drew on the leather. It helps keep it moisturized and scrubs out spill stains or marks.
5.0,Love love love it
5.0,Immensely happy with the quality and beauty of this necklace. it sure looks real. The gold plated finish is lovely
5.0,"I have had neck surgery, and still have problems, magnetic copper helps with lessening the pain. I've had so many compliments on how pretty it is!"
5.0,These are wonderful I would recommend them to anyone
5.0,better product then expected.... bought for my mother 90 years old .. she has difficulty putting on ... needs the aide or me....i thought this a better product then the copper....but highly favorable though...
5.0,Love it! It’s exactly as pictured. Shipping was fast and the color is great.
5.0,Comfortable even on my large calves. And warm. They are great under tall boots.
5.0,"Fits as expected, no complaints."
5.0,"Very nice...ordered three of this waist trainers size M, two for my sisters and one for me..it fit really well, but I think mine should have been size S...cos I like it much tighter, still really like the fit..good Quality too, highly recommend this waist trainer..great costumer service too and fast shipping, will definitely be getting the small soon..😊"
5.0,This necklace is just beautiful!!  My son loved it for his birthday. They did such a great job getting me it by his birthday!!  Jessie at Sporting Faith is a so nice and and his service is great!  If you looking for a baseball cross this is the one you want!!
5.0,"They are great. Lightweight & perfect for summer. Very comfortable. Kind of expensive, but I like them a lot."
5.0,"Bought for son, I think they are stupid but he loves them"
5.0,"Nice and sturdy , very good quality .. I highly recommend this purchase."
5.0,Hugged my curves in all the right places!
5.0,little bling just enough shine love the size
5.0,This is my new go-to hate and I'll be buying the other options with the cork bill too. Lots of compliments the first time I wore this out. Nice and snug without being to bulky on the front of the hat.
5.0,"So for reference, I am 5'6"" and 150 lbs. I could easily fit two of me in this thing. It hits just below my knees, which is perfect. This is the perfect blanket hoodie to snuggle up in on the couch. I can easily tuck my legs into it, and it is so warm. The entire thing is lined inside inside and is very soft. The arms are about 4 inches too long for my liking, but considering how big this is it's not too surprising. It technically is one size fits all, but I do wish they had a smaller adult size to buy!<br /><br />Regardless, this is super soft and comfortable, very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,This Champion short is very comfortable and fits as expected.
5.0,As described . Original
5.0,Very nice...use it all the time
5.0,Perfect for me lol i love it!!!
5.0,Nice lightweight material. Pretty light pink color. Very flattering. Dressed it up for work and down for an evening outing.
5.0,"I bought this for my wife and she LOVES it. She has worn it every day without any problems (not in the shower or swimming though). the first few times she accidentally got it wet ( washing dishes, bathe the dog etc.,) it did 'bleed' and turned her wrist a tint of purple but nothing a little soap and water didn't fix. It is very durable. Now, a month later, it doesn't leech any colors when it gets wet, and it is still in great shape."
5.0,Love these they are adjustable and warm and fit thight and do not Fall Off my head!  Love the color also.
5.0,I work at a desk all day and these make my legs feel so much better
5.0,Very pleased with my purchase
5.0,"Great for the price you pay. Definitely not the real thing but if this style makes it past a few months, I'll probably buy the actual Dior shades."
5.0,Fit really well! Looks great! I will recommend
5.0,"I bought this for my niece's birthday and she loved it. She was so excited that it was her birthstone too. She yelled ""It's PERFECT!"""
5.0,"This dress was nice.  I am 5'3 135lbs and ordered a medium.  I probably could have gone with a small, but the medium fits well if you want it to be a little loose."
5.0,Had to re-sow crotch and inner legs area twice so far.
5.0,My wife loved it!!! &#60;3
5.0,These are super cute and fit my face perfect. So far they’ve been comfortable. And super light weight.
5.0,Just like the picture and great quality
5.0,Beautiful and comfortable! I ordered aside down due to reviews saying it ran large and the fit was good when ordering with that information! Have my eye on the navy one now.
5.0,"Y’all! This dress is great! The fit is flattering and seems to be pretty much on target with the size chart. It’s a super soft material and seems to be well made. It’s form fitting, but stretchy material that’s forgiving. I love it!!"
5.0,"Highly recommend this product, it helps in many ways and it's fun for my daughter. You can definitely hear them coming or when something is too quiet and now its suspect that they're not making noise."
5.0,Lots of compliments. Good quality
5.0,Tshirts are perfect Chrisas gift
5.0,"There’s something that feels strangely pro-consumer about this watch. Growing up, I’ve always assumed it impossible to find a quality product at 1/10th the price of the competition; however I’ve happily replaced my old expensive watch with this cheap Casio, and haven’t looked back. The display is readable in any condition and the watch / included band are very comfortable and light on the wrist. I first tried out the more expensive Casio “world traveler” watch, and it wasn’t comfortable whatsoever. This tiny Casio F91w feels like a much smarter option. It’s disposable by choice, the watch won’t force you to throw it out for a replacement but if you can if you want. So far, I haven’t noticed much time loss, but with how easy it is to set the watch, if it started falling out of sync updating it would be no problem. I really enjoy this product, and I hope Casio doesn’t discontinue it anytime soon as I intend on making this my main watch for years to come."
5.0,"I have never received so many compliments on any article of clothing I own! Really pretty and nice and flowy, perfect for spring! It's still cold where I am, so I put on leggings underneath and you would have any idea! Highly recommend buying!"
5.0,I have large wrists and this band fits comfortably with some slack
5.0,Liked these stretchy bands only problem it was black which is fine but plain black no sparkly which is why I originally bought it.
5.0,GOOD LOOKING
5.0,"Perfect fit!! It's a very rich wine color, more purple than red, but it also compliments my coffee brown leather steampunk corset beautifully!!!<br />Couldn't have chosen a better outfit!!"
5.0,"Used this backpack to fly as a carry on with SouthWest Airlines. Great backpack! Thick and sturdy, colors just as pictured. I love it! And i think the badly translated words are hilarious xD"
5.0,This is a great bag for traveling. Stylish and sturdy
5.0,So cute and festive
5.0,"Fits great, looks great"
5.0,My fave glasses ! I've ordered 2 pairs and have had friends order the same ones because they loved them on me . It's hard for me find glasses for my small face but these are perfect !
5.0,"Soft, good fit"
5.0,"Prefect fit, very comfortable and looks great."
5.0,"The quality of this polo shirt is impressive for the $9 I paid. It's a polyester blend, which works great for golf as 100% cotton polos don't wick sweat away. It does fit a tad loose, but I'm hoping it shrinks just a tad after a wash. The most amazing thing - It's the proper length! As a tall gall, Lacoste and other name brands are just too short. This one's the perfect length to be tucked into a pair of golf pants."
5.0,Nice glasses. I live it. Also I'm new with this. I've used it what I feel pretty good at night. It's worth to buy and recommend for you. When I put on them I saw clearer on free way
5.0,Amazingly easy to put on !! They look beautiful and the size is perfect !!!  They are exactly what I was looking for !!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9c1e2213a862a9d03f70acd216f064cb]] I think these gloves are really freaking cool.<br /><br />I ordered these on 6/24, and they were delivered on 6/26 (wow, fast!!). I have to say, I'm decently impressed by the look and quality of these gloves. My first impression though: these are going to be HOT. As in, hands too warm. Why do I say this? Because these are equivalent to knit winter gloves, except there are 2 layers. The black and white outer layer are knit together, and there's a lining on the inside; the LED cables are in between the two. The fit: to be honest, they were a bit hard for me to get on my hands (my hands are a women's size L), but the material did stretch so I could pull them on all the way, and I didn't feel like my hands were being squished, so they do stretch out a bit. The LED cables go from a concealed controller (on the back of the hand) up the middle of each finger, to the tip of the finger. You can hardly tell they're there, they're so thin and flexible. I did find the button on the controller a bit hard to turn on/off, mainly because it's hard to find it (it's a very small button) through a layer of knit material; even more so with both gloves on. The controller's concealed between the two layers, accessible via a velcro-sealed opening at the base of the gloves. I believe it'd be pretty easy to change the batteries (although I didn't try doing this). The lights are BRIGHT, strong/steady and didn't cut out at all while I was wearing them. I turned them on and my kitten was mesmerized by them the entire time! (she really liked the box, too!)  Overall, definitely recommended. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
5.0,"My grandson, age 13, is happy with it. It doesn't seem too large for him, so I'm not sure how it would fit an adult."
5.0,I hoped the pants was black instead of navy blue since the top doesn't have navy blue
5.0,This was the perfect little outfit for my Son’s Golf Themed Cake Smash photoshoot.
5.0,"Clever useful design, especially for travelling.  Completely unnoticeable.  Fits my small RFID card holder plus a wad of cash for casino time!  I didnt put my phone in it, but it would have fit."
5.0,Love love them
5.0,This dress is adorable!!!! Love it!
5.0,My daughter loves these purple rain boots! She asked me several times when it’ll rain. I would recommend to my friend.
5.0,Comfortable soft fabric but too long
5.0,"Very badass shirt. Was surprised the buttons and the print are very good quality with rich color. I think as far as sizing goes just order one size larger then you normally would if you need breathing room, I ordered an xl and the size was spot on but someone who wears a large could fit comfortably as well in an xl. If you like your shirts a little looser when you sit down then a size larger is the way to go"
5.0,I really like this dress. I did order the 5xl and usually wear a size 20. I have a large bust at 44 full D and the dress for well. I bought a poof slip to go under and it really helps enhance the look. This seams are stitched well and fit together nicely. Seriously for $24 or so this money well spent.
5.0,Really cute kitty. The chain was cheap but the kitty was awesome
5.0,I love the way it's organized and the more subdued color.
5.0,"My favorite microwave steamer finally gave up the ghost and while I liked the fact that it was long enough (rectangular) to do an ear of corn this one, which is round and too small, I'm very satisfied.  Works great for everything else."
5.0,My grandson loved it.
5.0,I love the classic 80s vibe of a good Casio watch and the low price point can’t be beat! Easily a great “wear it and wreck it watch” for when I’m out working.
5.0,I like these tanks as I’m pregnant and fits perfectly. It’s a good length and I don’t have to worry about the tank being loose or rising up. I will definitely buy again.
5.0,I haven't worn a cardigan in years but decided to try this one in charcoal.  The wool is soft and the weave is very nice.  I ordered the XL and it fits nicely.  I've worn it two or three times so far and I could not be more pleased.
5.0,This was a great purchase. We used it at my daughter's birthday and the kids styled their own cape and had lots of fun. I recommended because it's a good price and they can create their own super hero so no one will cry about having just one superman cape.
5.0,Love these.  Very light weight.  Comfortable.
5.0,"Best thing i have bought off this website i am in love right now. I havnt ever been in love before so i dont exactly now what it feels like, wow i have never loved before this, and im no spring chicken eather, oh my goodness i need  stop online shopping and go get a man. Maybe i should start bathing and put on pants once in a while, i bet i coukd put up flyers reading: emotionaly unstable, with a hint of sanity and no motovation to get off the toilet let alone leave the house with shoes on."
5.0,I loved the shirt but i apparently selected the wrong size. I have to return it and get smaller
5.0,"Bought it as a birthday gift for my wife, who is into celtic items. Looks just as good in person as it does in the pictures. She was quite happy with it."
5.0,"Best pair of sunglasses I've ever owned. As a bus driver at a ski resort, sunglasses matter, and the polarized lens on these are useful even in low light. Basically, if the weather where you are changes a lot then these are the sunglasses for you."
5.0,I gave this keychain to my sister and she loves it
5.0,I bought a Large since I am a 34DDD. It fits great and snug enough to not gap at the bottom band. I bought in black also. I took the cups out just because I always do.  I recommend.
5.0,"The Blue Hamsa Chai Key Chain came in perfect condition. Very pleased, it looks exactly like the internet picture. Can't wait to give it to my friend for their birthday, I know they will like it a lot."
5.0,Great value. Lapis beads perfect accent.
5.0,This sweater is So adorable and goes well with both her dresses and playclothes
5.0,Very comfortable Pilates socks. They have just enough grip. They wash nicely also.
5.0,"These are comfortable and fit just like I expected. An added bonus that I didn't know about before buying is thay they have a small pocket on the inside of the waistband, great for carrying your chapstick!"
5.0,Looks and fits my daughter great
5.0,"I love it, fit is great, color and material perfect for my needs"
5.0,Nice.  I bought it for a sixties party.  It fits the bill
5.0,Great duster. Comfortable. Won't shrink when washed. My mom loves it!
5.0,Belt arrived on time and fit well. Overall quality was very good and look and feel were better than I expected on line.
5.0,"This sweater is very comfortable. It is very soft to wear. It is very nice. It matches with everything.<br /><br />It washed just fine. It helped keep me warm. It is easy to put on and off.<br /><br />It is flattering and looks attractive. It seems durable and well made. The fit is fine. It is a good thickness, not too hot but nice coverage. It would make a nice gift.  I would recommend it."
5.0,"The earrings are a beautiful green. I guess I didn't realize the size when I ordered them. THEY ARE REALLY, REALLY TINY."
5.0,"Very well made, soft lether, fits perfect. On the size runs little bit bigger.<br />Deffinetly will buy more shoes from Pablosky."
5.0,This case is larger than what I got from the eye doctor which is great because I keep clip-on sunglasses in it also.  Love it!!  I'm a total Betty fan and just had to have it!!
5.0,"My boyfriend had been wearing a broke watch for ages. I knew he loved Harry Potter, big faced watches and so I thought this would be a good gift. Little did I know how much he'd love it. It's classy while still being true to one of his favorite series. he gets compliments on it all the time, and most don't realize it's Harry Potter till he tells them so it's a fun secret."
5.0,"I'm 6ft tall and 207 lbs. I ordered the XL (navy/white) and the fit was close to perfect. The material feels comfortable and the design/color results in a garment that's ""subtle"" for an Hawaiian shirt. Perfect for sunny weekends and days at the beach."
5.0,"I love this jacket, its warm, fitted right, comfortable, and not too heavy.  I want more"
5.0,Cap was purchased as a gift for our son who is an Arsenal fan.  He is very pleased with the cap!

5.0,Love these! Fit perfectly! Soft and comfortable. Will be getting more ! Wore these for Halloween but I still wear them all the time! Highly recommend ❤️❤️
5.0,Adorable. I put both on at the same time and have them wrapped together for a cool bulky bracelet look. The watch came with an extra battery and a cool bronze colored thumb ring that looks like a feather. Maybe they had extra laying around that day but it was a fun surprise to my order.
5.0,"I got these 2 match a necklace I bought & although I wasn't disappointed, these are more green than teal...unlike as shown in the picture. It's really pretty but def. not blue-ish teal like I was hoping. I still recommend it though!"
5.0,Very nice but runs small
5.0,Really great quality for the price. Fits right and much better than I expected.
5.0,Good safety addition during the Cocid era.
5.0,Material is stretchy and comfortable. I bought a large but probably could have went down a size. Very professional looking and have received several compliments.
5.0,Its not Jersey so that the best part. it doesnt stick. The material is  flowy and formal and the green color is true to picture. I love it.
5.0,wonderful fit and feel.  the best for actual large women ever (i wear size 24 pants and these are not tight)
5.0,"My granddaughter likes to wear headbands that match her outfits.  These are so pretty, soft and comfy, and there is something in the group for every color choice outfit you might have. This was a big hit with my granddaughter and her Mom!"
5.0,Great socks perfect for my toms and low slip on shoes
5.0,Happy with detailed necklace of Jack and Sally!
5.0,Literally just received but my new prescription sunglasses fit perfectly. Pretty design on the outside and a bright green color on the inside. Seems sturdy but only time will tell.
5.0,"I have been living in this sweater this winter. It is so amazingly soft, and very thick. I am glad I decided to splurge and purchase this sweater because I've already gotten so much wear out of it, and winter's not over yet! It came packaged very nicely. I was impressed that so much care went into the presentation, the company is obviously very proud of their product, as they should be."
5.0,Didnt expect these to be so nice for the price! Nice padding and looks just like the pics.
5.0,Favorite socks. Comfortable. Wash up nicely.

5.0,This dress is awesome! It's perfect for work.
5.0,These are very well made n so worth the price my daughter looks beautiful n everyone
5.0,"I love this dress.  I got many compliments from it.  It is great for the price.  The material is alittle thin and the pattern is not through the whole material kind of more like printed so you can see the thin-ness to the fabric at times, but it was exactly what I expected for such a good price.<br /><br />It fit really nice.  I have a little roundness to my stomach and it hid it nicely. :)  I normally wear a L-XL and ordered an XL to give myself less clinging since I didn't know about the material.  I am glad I ordered up."
5.0,"I bought this wallet for my boyfriend last year and it is still in great shape. It fits all of his cards, he has it pretty stuffed, but it stays pretty low profile. The only thing is the ID holder is a little tight. I am impressed with how nice it still looks a year later."
5.0,"It's a lot more classy than sexy.<br />Fits as expected. Zipper is definitely going to break in the next 10 uses but overall it's a very cute, classy dress with a twist.<br />Be mindful of the collar in the pics."
5.0,Very cute watch band
5.0,Family bowling tournament coming up- wanted to look like a PRO!!

5.0,"The CUTEST apron and hat set! My 2 year old loves helping out in the kitchen and playing with her pretend set. I grabbed this for her and she loves it!! It's a high quality, durable material and has held up well over multiple washes. With the adjustable straps, it will fit her for many years. Highly recommend!!"
5.0,"Gorgeous earrings, love them"
5.0,Nice fit. I wear it around the house to feel comfortable & cute
5.0,"love it, its comfortable and fit great, super happy and especially for the price"

5.0,"It’s amazing, working well."

5.0,Very nice...My Grandsons will like them...Christmas presents...
5.0,I love this sweater. I've never seen anything like this (where the zipper is).
5.0,My dad loves this and wears this while barbequing.
5.0,"I had very low expectations about these working. My glasses are a bit of an odd shape and I did not find anything in person that worked.  Anything that came close to working looked terrible.  These work very well - the tint is super dark, they FIT over my glasses and while they're not the most stylish thing going, they also do not look like Elmer Fudd's sunglasses.<br /><br />They also fold into a super small little package which is pretty neat.  I worry that I'll break them when folded, and its very easy to cover them in fingerprints during the folding, but they could slide into a pocket if needed.<br /><br />Totally worth the current $22 price!"
5.0,Received items on time! Very good quality set!
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for.  When you can get a pair of sunglasses like these for $5, why in the world would you pay any more for anything else?"
5.0,I was hesitant to purchase a dress online. The dress fits perfectly and has the right amount of stretch. Pairing this dress with boots or heels makes it a most flattering addition to my wardrobe.
5.0,"Very cute dress, the material is nice and good length not to short."
5.0,Son wears a mens 14 and these fit perfectly. Nice quality!!!!
5.0,This worked perfect for snorkeling. It was nice to have one piece and not deal with a rash guard. The arms are a tiny bit sort but maybe I just have long arms. It fit nice and I got lots of compliments.
5.0,"I cannot say enough about California Livin' and Tommy!!  The superior service we got from him when we purchased this pair of Ed Hardy sunglasses was excellent!!  If you want great customer service and beautiful merchandise, I suggest you buy from California Livin'!!!!!!"
5.0,I bought this for my granddaughter's eighth birthday. The watch is very pretty. We set the time immediately upon arrival and it has kept perfect time. My granddaughter loves her new watch. She is looking forward to showing it off at school.

5.0,Helps keep the sweat from going into your face. I love them
5.0,"I have different bracelets with different charms for different moods and outfits. They are so beautiful, it's hard to resist."
5.0,"I love the soft leather, roominess, and versatility. I wish there was a place for my cell phone."
5.0,Great fit and length! Love it! :)
5.0,"So.... why 5 stars... Because I purchased this for my best friend and just guessed the size... she is usually about an 18/20, 5'5"", about 40B/C. I always order one size up with suits - but here's the thing... she reported she LOVED the suit for color and style, but it was about 2 sizes too big!  In any case, she returned it and I ordered the 18/20.  I will review it once she's received it, tried it and found it to be the right size.  I had read others reviews that suggested it ran a bit on the small side... as my dear friend is not a ""small"" person, I added sizing which apparently was not necessary... I am thinking it may be that she is smaller in the bust area.. but we will see what she says.  Other than the sizing, she really loved the suit for color, pattern and style. Had it fit she says it would have been her new favorite.  So that sounds like it's worth it to get the right size.<br />UPDATE: Best friend reports 20 is the perfect fit for her.  She notes that if you are really big busted, you might need the next size. Hope this helps!"
5.0,EXACTLY what i was looking for!
5.0,I absolutely love these rompers! Great fit! I really wish I could’ve found them all in my size!  Great for the loose casual lounging!
5.0,very prefect !

5.0,"This was a speratic random buy, don't know anything about this item - but it looks awesome when I wear my indie-urban outfits that I sport!"

5.0,Owned one ever since I was a kid.  Dependable watch and simple to use.
5.0,Great quality and color matching.  My grandson was the star of the show.
5.0,This was one of the cutest things that I saw. It fit very well and it was very comfortable. Would recommend to anyone trying to add a fun look to their kids outfits

5.0,"Very cute! My son gave this to his teacher for Christmas, she loved it! Nice quality"
5.0,Awsome fitting and lightweight. Great for active people for both sports and recreation. Would definately be ordering more in comming months for gifts.

5.0,Very soft and size seems accurate. Perfect gift for my 5 year old.
5.0,"These earring are so cute and fun, I got allot of compliments on them. Love them, looks exactly like picture"
5.0,It was a Christmas gift for my son and he feel in love with with it it’s perfect and it wasn’t thin it was very nice
5.0,"Excellent for the price! The fabric a bit stiff and thin (not see-through or rough to the touch though), but it looks great. I did not have the problem with it being too small in the bust, but I'm a 32B so take that with a grain of salt. The cut of the dress is very forgiving to being bloated, etc. so it will definitely become a wardrobe staple for me. It looks very professional while still looking cute. My only complaint would be that while the skirt is short and the fabric is stiff, you have to be a bit careful getting out of cars and the like. But like I said, for the price, you can't beat it. I would recommend overall (assuming it will fit and the bust won't be too big!)"
5.0,I bought it as a gift to my husband and he loves it
5.0,"Very comfortable and works as intended. I am pregnant and wear these every evening after work when my feet are swollen and it helps bring them back to normal. They are snug as they are supposed to, but still comfortable and functionable. I am happy with my purchase and would buy again."
5.0,Fits perfectly my daughter loves them
5.0,I love these swim shorts.  They are great.  Perfect fit. Very comfortable and the waist band makes for a flattering fit with out them falling off

5.0,"So cute! Wearing this to a bridal shower then to the wedding, it's feminine, delicate, and fun! The headband is black though, it doesn't bother me but if you have blonde hair it may be noticeable"
5.0,"I got this on sale for a steal. It's comfy, fits well, and so cute for photos!"

5.0,It does exactly what it is supposed to do.
5.0,What a Beautiful Wedding dress !<br />I felt like a Fairy tale Princess in this Dress.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b91051b2a3d2537d1130233327bcae6c]] I wasn't sure what to expect when I was personally asked if I would do a video/text review on this Zanzea dress. I really thought it was going to be more of a heavier type burlap/gauze feel to it but, I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a beautiful material that has more of a silk/gauze scarf like feel to it..it's so vibrant and I love the simple cut of it. Looking at it hanging here I like how the top orange part has the slit up the side and then the ends taper to a point...honestly it fit me great too. The only thing that I can even dis on it about is that it is a super wrinkled material. I plan to take the steam iron to it but, I have been a bit under the weather. At any rate my measurements are 36C-29-36. I purchased the large and like I said this dress fit me perfect. The other thing I love about it is that you just pull it over your head no buttons or zippers to mess with. Oh and it also matches some of the beautiful scarfs I own. I did receive this dress as a sample in exchange for my thoughts on it. Peace! ~Kiki"
5.0,It's perfect !
5.0,Like the WU says....protect your neck!
5.0,Exact replacement of the end pieces of my shade!
5.0,Iguales a la foto
5.0,"ive had them in for a couple weeks now, no issues and have not come loose at all."
5.0,They come with a tool and everything love them
5.0,"I've been eyeing this brand for nearly a year, so when I saw the Minimalist on their site as a woman's watch, I knew I had to snag it as a birthday present for my boyfriend's sister who has very classic style.  That said, I only had a few days and, knowing that the order would likely not arrive in time through the manufacturer's site, I turned to Amazon.<br /><br />I asked the manufacturer a question and, while they did reply the next day (and were awesome and helpful), I had assumed they weren't going to answer in time and I ended up ordering a different present.  However, they were so great and I was still so enamored by the watch that I ended up ordering it for me anyway.  Oh my, I'm in love.<br /><br />The face is quite big but somehow simultaneously dainty and classic.  The wood around the face is subtle and gorgeous.  Just absolutely in love.  If you're considering buying this watch, stop thinking and do it.  I'm still swooning and soon you will be too!"
5.0,"Hermosa, muy cómoda la tela es muy suave"
5.0,Loved the size
5.0,PRETTY AWESOME
5.0,"Great set. I have purchased this set many times over. (I have a bad habit of misplacing earrings.) Well made, nice sparkle, great price."
5.0,Looks very nice. At first my thought was that it was going to pull my hair on my wrist but was NOT the case. Glad I got it.
5.0,"These compression socks really work well and are comfortable to wear. They are relatively easy to get on even with an arthritic thumb!  They do help with circulation in the lower legs and feet.  I can see my ankle bones again. I've bought 4 pairs and will probably buy more.  If you have swelling in the ankles and calves, these socks will help you."
5.0,No warmth or thickness to them which is great for kids!
5.0,My daughter is pretty small in size so it fits a bit large. She had to wear her regular underwear with it. Super cute.
5.0,Fit as expected! My 4 year old wore this for family pics and got many compliments. Colors are rich and material is great.
5.0,My 10 year old was a big hit wearing this tie on our cruise.
5.0,Perfect<br />Really cute

5.0,Bought for my daughter. High quality
5.0,"I really like the material very soft and it stretches a little bit, extremely comfortable. I also like the front  pocket."
5.0,Stylish and nice and clear. But why did they engrave &#34;Polarized&#34; on the lens?!
5.0,"no cracks or imperfection, really well wrapped in bubble wrap, and it was perfectly in one piece! 👌 can't wait to use it."
5.0,awesome! they work great - very secure.  satisfied with my purchase.

5.0,Well tailored.  Loved the fit.  Very stylish!
5.0,Nice pin good price
5.0,Best sunglasses ever
5.0,"The silhouette this jacket has makes a statement, it's classy, maybe a little pirate-depending on what you wear- and will get a lot of compliments. Just don't let your furry baby climb on it, it will be a pain and time consuming to get the fur/hairs off."
5.0,I bought theese to put in the party bags for my son's birthday and ended up having enough for him to had out to his class. Great deal!
5.0,"Everything was as it should be - item as described, packaged right and delivered on time."

5.0,"Great product , great price too , arrived on time , now is like a new pair of shades , good quality , very satisified. tanx amazon."
5.0,"Works great for under hearing protection, as the arms are flat. Extended time at the range is more comfortable.<br /><br />Nothing negative to say about this product."
5.0,I was concerned when I ordered that they might be a little cheap looking but the price was very reasonable so I ordered anyway.  When they arrived I was surprised how cute they are and they don't look cheap at all.  I love them.  Very good quality.
5.0,The best...
5.0,You have to be careful getting into this dress as it does not have much room in the opening but once it's on it's comfortable and super pretty. Loved it.
5.0,"I never expect much when ordering clothing online,  especially when the price it too good to be true. That being said, I could not have been happier with this dress.  It fit me just right. I am a busty gal, usually size 16 women's dresses. I got a 2x."
5.0,It gave me a energy legs thx
5.0,Great price and product
5.0,"Love the dress, fits perfect.  had so many compliments on this dress. I've  never ordered clothes online, but Amazon has  never disappointed."

5.0,So beautiful and fits perfectly! I'm definitely ordering this in another color! Love it!
5.0,Used it for my Apple Watch. Was comfortable
5.0,"This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made these past few months. It was for a present, and my friend was dazzled. I love the design and it is great quality... it is also very modern, and delicate. I have had a hard time finding charms that would not look too diminute or plain, this one did the trick. In addition, you can see that the design is different from what you would find here, the designer is French and googling Ive found that they target their products for younger audiences. I also saw the prices and this is indeed perfectly priced (less than half of original euro value). So if you are looking for a perfect charm that may make your friend, mom, grandma or even yourself happy do not hesitate. Also look into the other products they have, they are beautifully executed and soooo pretty.... A fan."
5.0,Nice think fabric
5.0,I really wanted a light weight jacket I could fold up when I am not using it and this is perfect! As a mom I always have my hands full and this fits perfectly in the diaper bag when I am not using it. Lightweight but warm and perfect.
5.0,Its soft and flexible and most of all it breathable. just be sure to wash before use especially if you have sensitive skin.
5.0,"These were very very inexpensive but honestly, for what I paid they are pretty fantastic. I like the wacky colors and that this pack came with some good standard dark colors too. The material feels nice and soft and like it will hold up well enough, they are flattering enough, and comfortable. A good waist fit. My only complaint, if I had to have one, is that they seem slightly tight around the calf? I know I have more muscular calves but I thought that was kind of interesting. I really love these though and plan to buy more in the future!"
5.0,"These masks fit both my boys.  One is a small 11 year old and the other a young adult.  The masks are appealing with the lights and the ease of use.<br /><br />The boys chose this costume as it is a pretty low key from a planning and preparation view point, but they will make an entrance anywhere with its bright lights."
5.0,My Girlfriend loved it!
5.0,Excellent product. As advertized.
5.0,My granddaughter enjoyed it. She is having a blast.

5.0,This dress is perfect.
5.0,"Only received 4 pairs not 6, and the package was open inside the bubble mailer<br /><br />****Have to edit my review, I couldn’t find a way to contact the seller through the mobile app before leaving my review and without me contacting them the order was corrected and made right. Fantastic seller to work with once it was brought to their attention!"

I can use plenty of water to mop the floor and have no problem with slipping"
5.0,"Love this tutu dress! Was beyond perfect for our non traditional themed (coordinating colors coral & plum & gray) Christmas photoshoot! The neck is bigger. So don’t go up a size or if your child is like mine. She is 12 months weights 24lbs & it 28” long. I usually want it to last so I order up to 12-18m. But I bought 6-12m and it was perfect! It is short as other mentioned, so cute leggings or tights or diaper cover recommended. But I couldn’t be happier! Especially paired with a vest & headband for winter! It’s SUPER adorable!<br />Links below:<br />1) baby vest<br />2) baby headband"

5.0,I love them they are perfect
5.0,I purchased this bra for my wife. She has a very hard time finding a good bra with the right support. This bra was just what she needed and more. She says it is very supportive. It does not dig into her skin or leave any kind of marks. She loves the fact that it is very soft. I think she will be purchasing them in every color!
5.0,My son loved it until he lost it. Was a good wallet well made.
5.0,Granddaughter loved wearing this

5.0,I love this dress. I’m 5’6 weighing 225lbs and wear 40DDD. I’m usually a size 12/14 in clothing. I ordered an XL and it fit perfect. Tight on the chest area and loose at the midsection just how I was hoping.
5.0,Cute.  I am 5 10 250lbs amd the xxl was plenty big I will even have to belt it to give it a shape. Fabric is super sheer will need a layering piece for modesty.

5.0,I love them. They do run a little small but it depends on how wide your calf is. I really enjoy this style. I wouldnt buy any other compression sock.
5.0,"I shuffle around in these any time I'm in my home, super comfortable and warm! I'm a size 9.5, the 9-10 fit perfect. no complaints at all!"
5.0,"I’m really surprised how nice the gloves are. I don’t know how well they will hold up, they they aren’t what I would expect for the super inexpensive price. They are thick and fairly comfy, warm, and look good. They have a cool zipper pocket for hand warmers (or money, ID, etc). Even if they just last one winter it’s a good value. I don’t like buying expensive gloves as I tend to loose them. I would recommend."
5.0,Love how it fits and I love the pockets!
5.0,"Well designed workout top with a women’s body and needs in mind… It is long, fits over the hips and covers the top part of the booty (usually my preference).  It has a rouged tummy line allowing some easy in fabric giving my tummy some room for breathing and a little hiding.  It has a dropped neck which matches my sports bra (mindful of minimal suntan lines), racerback shaped back.<br /><br />Material:<br />Made from 93% Polyester, 7% Spandex, it is a smooth and stretchty material that has a nice 4 way stretch, smooth face and moisture wicks.<br /><br />So far it has washed really well (machine wash friendly).<br />Color is a nice dark grey heather which is a nice neutral that works with any outfit and hides dirt and sweat easily.<br /><br />Fits to size... more fitted at top chest and loser fit around mid section which adds the comfort.<br /><br />Really nice value for the price.  I’d highly recommend.<br />I hope this review was helpful.  If so could you please click “Helpful” below?  Many thanks"
5.0,"As another reviewer noted, it is definitely not white, nor is it beige really. It has a pinkish hue, like a light rose color. For some reason it comes off looking like plain beige in most photos. I took some pics of the robe next to a beige flannel blanket and white pillow case cover and you can see the true color better in those pics.<br /><br />I was afraid the XL might be way too big on me but it fits exactly as i'd hoped, oversized but not so big that it is sloppy looking. It is brushing along the tops of my feet, nearly touching the ground! I am SO excited to have found a robe with this long length on it and that has a hood. I love lounging around totally swaddled up in soft cozy fleece from my head down to my feet. ( For reference I am 5'  7 1/2&#34; and about 130lbs. When wearing my hawaiin sandals as in the photos I am about 5' 8&#34;.) The fleece is very soft, plush and cozy. It's a nice medium weight, not too thin but not so thick that it feels heavy.<br /><br />The pics were taken after washing and drying (low tumble) once. All the stitching feels secure and is intact and there was hardly any lint in the dryer. I am very pleased with the quality, so much so that I already ordered another to keep as a back-up.  I might even grab some as gifts for my sister & cousin."
5.0,I love the outfit and got plenty of compliments! I'm 140lbs-145lbs and I'm wearing a small. Fits perfect

5.0,These are so amazing!!! They are made so well and very sturdy. Great find for a cruise girls trip gift!!!
5.0,Love this! So cute and what a great price! The issue is it smells gross right out of the bag but just air it out for a bit and the wash it and the smell goes away.
5.0,Awesome gift for the Jason lover. Also the sender wrote a note on the mailed receipt that made me laugh. Good service
5.0,With these great pins you can use the comfy Barton straps that do not come with pins.  I used them for my Michele watch.  Great option to add to your strap collection at a great price

5.0,Bought to take on cruise. I was concerned however when they arrived I love them. Very cute!!  The pink is my favorite.
5.0,Love these boots! So comfortable. I might consider a cushioned insert if I will be doing a lot of walking though.
5.0,10.5 4E in USA fits perfect in 45 EU.
5.0,"I love my waist trainer. It runa a little smaller than i thought but, it gives me more of an incentive to lose weight. Fast shipping. Great buy!!"

5.0,I love these and I get compliments on the all the time.
5.0,I love this bag- it looks great and hold everything while staying lightweight- I’m sure it will be easy to clean when the time comes!
5.0,"This glasses are large and fabulous and I feel fabulous with them on.  The frames around the lenses are plastic, but the arms on the sides are metal in a rose gold color with accents at the edges of the lenses.  They feel comfortable and light on your face, while still feeling substantial and sturdy!  These glasses are going to go with absolutely everything and I think they just became my new favorite pair.  I highly recommend!<br /><br />I received this item through amazon vine and I voluntarily give my review."
5.0,"Love these hoodies! Soft and comfortable, great colors, my husband and I love them! Very happy, would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Thanks!"
5.0,"Nice material, product description accurate"
5.0,There Amazing!! Loved them.
5.0,Excellent braces.
5.0,"In the heat of summer, these shirts did their job well. Fit was good, price was right. It works."
5.0,"You get a really large collection of rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. The rings come in a wide range of sizes, normal sizes, so you will actually be able to wear them. The different sizes affords the ability to wear on different fingers. (i.e.; some will fit your pinky, some your thumb, some your ring finger, etc.)<br /><br />There is a wide variety of styles and there are some silver-colored items as well as some gold-colored items.  This set is costume jewelry, not fine jewelry, so they will lose their color after a while, faster if you get them wet.  However, when they do lose their gold or silver color, you are left with the base metal color, which appears to be copper.  I like the color of copper, so they are still wearable.  (mostly its the rings I am talking about, as they tend to get wet a lot, when washing hands, etc.)<br /><br />All in all a great set for the price."
5.0,"This bra was the perfect fit! I have a hard time finding bras in my size but this was just what i needed! Fits snug, fabric is nice, all and all good purchase!"
5.0,Love these leggings... i bought two pairs. I usually wear a small in leggings and got an xs. They are soooo comfortable and really breathable.
5.0,"I bought the wrong size, so I gifted them to my coworker."
5.0,Beautiful..<br />Very good quality.. Ordered for my daughter for Prom..
5.0,I was looking along time for one wallet like this and when I came across this wallet on amazon I decided to take a chance and order it. I was so surprised that the wallet arrived faster than when it was expected and I was so happy about that. I really really like my wallet because it has a lot of card slots and the separate compartment for cash and receipts. This is one of my favorite wallets so far. No complaints.
5.0,"Very pretty, great for gymnastics, LOVE that this leotard is cotton!"
5.0,Fits great. Love it
5.0,It is very pretty dress and soft too. Fits perfect
5.0,My granddaughter loved this mask as it's really attractive and easy to breathe out of. Mask came quickly and was so appreciated!
5.0,My apple watch looks amazing!
5.0,it is pretty
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Looks expensive. Would buy again
5.0,These were made in the USA instead of China and work great!  I recommend them.
5.0,"Perfect size, compact but enough to hold weekend trips and more, jacket etc. Lots of outside pockets and zippered section for laptop.I like that it was easy to fully open main zipper section vs trying to cramp something in from top."
5.0,I'm 5'7 130 lbs and I bought the XS size. Fits perfectly without being too tight
5.0,"These are amazing. I am a woman and I'm starting to wear men's clothes for comfort.<br />I'm 5 ft 8, 185 pounds, 36 waist, and 44 hips, and these fit like a dream.<br />They have Velcro adjustable hips just like my womens bike trunks which is a great feature. These are so dang comfy that I don't mind the 2 tone color. It actually looks pretty cool in person. There's 2 hip pockets and below them there are 2 zippered pockets.<br />I'm loving these and these were just the sign I was looking for to tell me that men's clothes are in fact a great idea for myself.<br /><br />I don't know why 1 leg looks so much longer than the other when these are laid out on a flat surface, because when you put then on, the legs look almost the identical length from the front but from the back one leg does look a bit longer. Strange..."
5.0,Beautiful leather in a great color. Had an issue and the company had terrific customer service and responded immediately. Will buy again!
5.0,"Super cute and very comfortable. I love neon colors and this fit the bill. The suite it's self is really very comfortable. Lots of coverage on top, booty is exposed in the back but else where it's plenty covered up. I needed a higher in the front as i have stretch marks from being pregnant ~ but want to wear a bikini.. this does the trick"
5.0,This dress looks AH-MAH-ZING on the body! You won’t be disappointed!
5.0,Great comfortable bra as an alternative to a traditional wired bra. Love it
5.0,Wife loves it!  Wants a couple more in different colors.
5.0,"Esta preciosa y se puede poner de los dos lados, yo la quería con una corredera larga y se la mande a cambiar, es tal cual como la presentan en la imagen y es muy buena calidad."
5.0,This watch is as much about s&w as it is about this cool and minimalist watch.<br />Their customer service and feedback were 5 star for sure. I am so pleased that I got what I wanted and from the right seller!
5.0,"I don't know about the sender sending it quick... I order it on Prime, so I knew it'd be here in like 3 days.<br /><br />What can you really say... they're tapers and tunnels and considerably cheaper than buying 'em at the tattoo shop.<br />They we're the correct size and the tunnels dropped right in after I used the tapers. Used a little witch hazel to help keep the o-rings in place. I don't wear either of them full time, but they did exactly the job I bought them for. So if you need some tapers to stretch with and some jewelry to keep it there - you'll get it in this package."
5.0,My son loves his new creeper hoodie.
5.0,"This chain is my favorite chain that I have ever owned and I have owned quite a bit of jewelry (gold rope chains, platinum figueroa, white gold, silver, etc etc.) So light you don't even feel it around your neck. I bought a titanium cross and slipped it on and it still didn't weigh it down at all! The most sturdiest chain I've had and I have been wearing it on a daily basis for 3 years now. I can't say enough about it, just awesome! I find it funny that some actually claim that it feels plastic or that it can be damaged easily. This is titanium one of the most indestructible metals on earth. This chain will probably last longer than I will."
5.0,Beautiful handbag I love it. A nice bag for the summer with plenty of room
5.0,Love these pants! They're so soft and comfy and I love the pockets. They keep things very secure.
5.0,Perfect for the price!
5.0,It met all expectations<br /> 😃
5.0,Amazing shirt loved it
5.0,arrived on time.  recieve compliments when i wear this.  it's light and soft with a pretty print.  thank you
5.0,"These sandals must be comfortable for my one year old because they're the only shoes he will bring to us to put on him when he wants to go outside. They have held up well for him with playing in the dirt, sand, and water. The sole is very flexible which is perfect for him as a new walker."
5.0,"It is for petit women, not for 5.6 so I advised don’t get it .. you won’t be able to wear ... others than that it beautiful and I still would like to have it ... but I ordered the biggest size and it didn’t get me, and I’m not fat , I’m 140 pounds and I’m 5,6"
5.0,When I opened  and try them It's very sexy and make me feel like model ! Love it
5.0,my daughter loves it...
5.0,"I love this material. It is soft and feels cool. I usually wear a 12 on the top and 6 on the bottom so I ordered the size L, because I wanted it roomy and comfy. The top is a little loose but nothing is hangin' out!! The shorts are loose and I don't have to unravel them when I am sleeping. They are well worth the money."
5.0,This was a cute gift to give to a friend who enjoys quilting.
5.0,"This dress has a soft stretchy lace and lining and is very comfortable.  I got it in navy which is very flattering.  However, it runs very small.  I am 5'3"" and 135 lb and ordered a large based on the sizing information, which was too tight and clingy, especially in the bust (I'm 36D).  I like things a little looser so I sent it back and got an extra large.  Am very happy with that size, it doesn't squeeze my body like the other one did.  Goes just a little past my knees which is all right with me too.  Haven't washed it yet so I don't know how it will hold up with laundering."
5.0,Super I’m so happy 😀 good purchased
5.0,As expected!  :)
5.0,"Delivered on time, great fit"
5.0,It's a little short in the torso. But not uncomfortable.
5.0,"Super silky, soft, and sexy! It worked perfect for my halloween costume."
5.0,"I thought it would be much larger--Dimensions are listed, that was my fault to picture it wrong."
5.0,"Love using these to keep cream or coconut oil on my hands overnight. Easy fit, very soft and great price."
5.0,My self comfortable and looks stylish
5.0,"I've worn Athens for over 10yrs. I love them. When the soles wear down I give them away. Everyone loves my gift. I have 6 pair now. I order 2 at a time. If something lead me to believe they were going to disappear I'd buy 20 pair. I first scored a pair at a thrift store. They were size 7, & fit. I wear a 9, so order accordingly. They also make a great gift."
5.0,I got my husband this jacket for riding his motorcycle and he loves it! It is so warm he is wearing it in December in Pennsylvania...would definitely recommend!
5.0,"This is so darn cute!  You will not be disappointed, and it is of good quality for price point.  I followed size chart and it fit accordingly.  Very happy and would like to order another one in a different color."
5.0,"I love these socks.  They are incredibly comfortable to wear, great compression without any loose or tight spots, adorable pattern...  BUT they are just a little short so they do not quite cover my calf and end up rolling down.  The first time I wore them before washing them, and they stayed up above my calf all day long.  Then, I washed them, and the next time I wore them, they would not cover my calf.  They slid down over and over throughout the day.  My legs ended up with lines all over them because of the fabric bunching.  I do have bigger calves so I think for the average woman (S-XL) they would be fine.  Very disappointing because these were so great after my first shift (I am a nurse - 12 hour shifts), I was ready to buy 10 pair.  I do have a pink striped pair and had the same exact issue with them.  Very unfortunate for girls with bigger calves, but these truly are a great product. I'm saying 5 stars for the quality and compression and fit as expected because I really thought they would be even smaller considering I am more voluptuous with bigger calves."
5.0,"I got this bag as a gift for my teenage daughter, and she was delighted with it. Stylish fabrics and clever reversible design make this bag fun as well as functional!"
5.0,It’s like a legging but more stylish. Very comfortable. I love these and wish they had it in more patterns or colors. I would buy every single one.
5.0,Love sock it to me socks!!!
5.0,Love this dress. Can wear Year round. Fabric washes wonderfully
5.0,"Comfortable and cool. Great for yoga and dance. They lay nicely against the belly and give ample coverage to the booty without &#34;riding up&#34; and being, well... invasive! Haha."
5.0,"I adore this dress! The model in the photo is taller like me so it fits exactly like hers does in terms of length. The color is fantastic to. A word of caution when washing this, if you hang dry your clothes like me, the material gets very heavy when it is in the washer."
5.0,Cute little cuff
5.0,"if you like good rock & roll, this guy is one of the best, & this dvd contains his best live performances."
5.0,"Very comfortable, breathable material"
5.0,Item as expected. Going to use for sons wedding reception. Haven’t put them together yet.
5.0,I can't believe how great this is for such a cheap price! It's beautiful and elegant!
5.0,Nice pajama set. It is cut small. I bought for my daughter and she loves it. Great size for a teenager.
5.0,"This is so cool! I loved it. I wore it as part of a Daenerys Targeryen costume (Game of Thrones) and it was absolutely perfect. I would also wear this as just part of any outfit -- even a suit dress would look great under it.  It is slightly see-through but it's not really an issue as you wear it over something else like a cardigan or coat. It was exactly what I was expecting. The shoulder pads are light and just right. The white is not quite a cool white, but more of a warmer, creamy white."
5.0,"love this shirt. Fits perfectly and goes from office to casual so easily! the lace is a beautiful feminine touch and the stretch fabric is figure-flattering. I got this in dark purple and love it. I am going to get at lease one other color, if not 2! It did take a while for shipping, but that's because my order (perhaps because of the color?) came from China. Still, it was just under 2 weeks to arrive, so not bad really.<br /><br />I am a 34D bra, 125lbs - the medium fit perfectly. Often times I wear a small but in this case, I'd say order up a size and if you don't want it real fitted, then order up 2 sizes."
5.0,"I am a big fan.  I have one in each vehicle and a couple in different purses.  They are sturdy, easy to clean and hold a day's worth of food.  They are strong and feel like they will last a long time. It feels great to reduce the single use plastic load on our environment."
5.0,"I stare at two computer screens Mon-Fri from 8am-5pm so when I started to have some twitching in my eyes as well as blurry vision with my contacts on, I decided to give this a try. The blurry vision is better and the eye twitching went away completely. Im sure I had eye strain but these glasses are great. Lightweight, cute colors and not expensive at all."
5.0,Bought this for my wife. She received many compliments. Some people told her it was a movie star type of dress. Very happy with purchase.
5.0,may the force be with you
5.0,Awesome product perfect
5.0,LOVED the boots! However they run small!
5.0,I am so glad I made this purchase.  They just the right size not to big or small.
5.0,"Super cute, I got for my mom who loves cats."
5.0,Loved this set!
5.0,"It is exactly as described. It works well as a slim wallet and holds my 4 credit cards, DL, and 4 business cards without issue, as well as a couple bills. The packaging was nice and professional. I would recommend to someone who is wanting to get rid of a huge wallet. As long as the band doesn't wear or break I'll keep my review 5 stars."
5.0,Very pretty color and true to size. If you want an oversized fit - I would size up.
5.0,Fun and trendy!
5.0,I absolutely love it ‼️
5.0,Feels like it's well made and does it's job. It's a nice looking umbrella too.
5.0,Nice product for kids. Son really enjoyed the gift and wears weekly.
5.0,"I was looking for a gift for my sister and this looked beautiful. The fact that it glows made it even better, just had to get it! This item took about 3 weeks to be delivered, which fit my time frame. I would have liked for it to have been available through Amazon Prime, but that's fine. I wanted to give you an idea of how long it may take.<br /><br />It came in a small mailing envelope in a jewelry zip bag. This is fine, but I think it would have been nice to have received it in a jewelry box.<br /><br />Let me tell you, this necklace is beautiful! I love all the little swirls and added details of small cubic zirconia stones. I like the way it illuminates and displays the silhouette of the heart swirls.<br />It doesn't take much light to illuminate it! I shined a flash light on it and it immediately glowed even in daylight! I give this five stars! It is a neat necklace to have in my collection! I can wear it with everything too!<br /><br />* I was able to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, fair and unbiased personal experience.<br /><br />My evaluations are based on my personal experience with this product. I am not at all influenced by the seller or by the discount that I receive. I will not give a product 5 stars unless I believe it truly rates it.<br /><br />As an avid Amazon shopper, I look to the guidance of other reviewers and reviews in order to weigh my options on whether I should purchase a product because of other in depth reviews.<br /><br />I hope my review will help and guide you in your choice to purchase or not purchase this product! :)"
5.0,Fits my 9 year old perfectly.
5.0,This costume is great!! the gloves and belt come off which was super nice when grabbing things and when I had to use the bathroom. The only bad thing about this thing is that the belt tends to slide. I fixed this with a small safety pin in the front. The neck is not tight when I sat down for long periods and never rubbed. It did not ride up. it just stayed and looked amazing. I got so many compliments wearing this cosplay. The feet are totally enclosed. I am required to wear shoes to school so I took the soled out of my converse and velcroed them on the bottom. worked beautifully. I could also zip the back by myself. This was a life saver. The zip is awesomely made and is far from cheap. I am 5'6 and weigh 130 I ordered the Medium and am very happy I did. Fit me like a glove.
5.0,I send one home via snail mail a few days before school starts. We have a nautical theme so they fit perfectly with our motif!! The girls usually attach them to a bracelet and the boys usually put them on a key chain.
5.0,"I'm a size 26/28/3x.  I simply love these shirts.  I'm familiar with this fabric combination and sized up.  Glad I did.  It's a great A-line shirt/tunic that I initially bought to knock around the house/wear for errands.  Instead, I'm wearing them to work and have received many compliments.  The fabric drapes beautifully and is so very soft.  I only wish they offered it in more colors."
5.0,These leaves are very pretty. They are so delicate looking and ornate that everyone loves them
5.0,These leggings are amazing and fit perfectly.  Great quality and the fabric is not too heavy and not too thin.They hit at just the right spot and hold you in without being too tight.  Love these!
5.0,"These glasses are cute and a great deal. I've purchased them multiple times since I have a tendency to lose sunglasses, and I don't feel bad about it at this price. I like them better than many of the nicer sunglasses I've tried! Highly recommend."
5.0,Granddaughter loves this.  Would buy again
5.0,"My daughter LOVES these. We could no longer find the underwear she was wearing before, and the ones she had were getting too small and starting to cut into her legs. She is VERY picky about her underwear and she was skeptical about buying these. When she put them on, she was in LOVE! She said they are so soft and so comfortable and they don't ride or move at all. They are a big spendy for an 11 year old, but comfort is important, so we spent more to get something she would like. If you are hesitant about spending the money, don't be. They are wonderful!"
5.0,"Just a great little everyday timepiece. Has a very short band, so changed  it to a NATO band and it's great."
5.0,My son has been concerned about drilling holes on his ukulele seeing other straps.  He is glad that he doesn't need to drill the hole with this strap.
5.0,"This outfit is incredibly beautiful and has an amazingly high quality of fabric. It's stitched together well. I highly recommend it due to the fact that it lets my daughter feel like a ballerina even though she's in a creative movement class. She can freely move with it and it's not too big or too small. She wears a size 3-4 and this is exactly the size I bought and it fits her just right. The tutu does not get in the way and it bounces whenever she is dancing, which is an added plus with the cute outfit! Highly recommended!"
5.0,Cute with quality ..granddaughters love wearing them
5.0,Fits perfect. It's a jacket for cold weather.
5.0,Love the scarf.
5.0,Love these!  Very comfortable!

5.0,My uncle loved this
5.0,I love these! Def size down for more compression. I usually wear a women’s L but the Med fit perfectly and the compression is just right!
5.0,The color & size are perfect! 💜
5.0,This was a hit! I bought this for my niece’s birthday party and she was wearing them all day pretending to be a princess. It was so sweet. Great quality and value for the price!
5.0,"These shoes are adorable on little or large feet.  They arrived in due time, and in new condition.  My grand daughter just loves them!"
5.0,I love me beautiful big comfy sweat shirt.. got 2x so I can have that extra big feel
5.0,They are very comfortable and super easy to adjust. They fit a variety of size frames I've used then on.
5.0,"I've worn Hanes for, like, FORever, but in the last few years, their quality has definitely taken a nose-dive. Thought I'd give these Wigwams a try. Cost a little more, but wow - HUGE difference in thickness, construction and quality. Pretty sure these will outlive Hanes by at least three-fold, if not longer. Wigwam has a customer for life, as long as they keep making them this nice. And made in the USA, too!!"
5.0,"I was impressed with how well this fit, given the price! Try it out for yourself! Got a bunch of compliments on it. :)"
5.0,We have several of the Arcade belts. These belts are amazing quality and last forever!

5.0,"Nice belt, cool tools to go with it."
5.0,Great shorts for the price. Use them for tennis and workouts. Very comfortable.
5.0,I ordered two of these and they are exactly as shown. The colors are very pretty and I can't wait to wear them.
5.0,Husband like it
5.0,"Love these bags. Excellent quality. Light to carry and durable. It was a gift, my friend loved it!"
5.0,My son loves these pajamas! Fits great! He is 9 and the large gives him some room to grow!
5.0,"Excelente calidad, super recomendado ... Mido 1.70 mts ya soy de contextura delaga, pedí talla SM y me quedó muy bien."
5.0,"I made the mistake (twice in ten years) of allowing red wing to upsell my insole, then after a few weeks didn’t like the new versions I tried (I had since used the stock ones as replacements in my older boots). These are what you get with new boots and most comfortable in my opinion."
5.0,"Great clutch for the money, nicely sized."
5.0,very nice material and it makes it easy to dress up a sweater.  I liked it so much i purchased another one for a gift.
5.0,Great for my granddaughter
5.0,"It's as expected, very nice"
5.0,I bought some pants and jeans that I didn't read the measurements of and needed something to give me the extra inch. These worked perfect. I mostly use the button with the rubber loop.
5.0,I like the design<br />Very sexy and fits very well
5.0,Great service with this company. Love the colors
5.0,"Love, love these boots!!  I bought the red ones and they were definitely an eye catcher. I get so many compliments........  the first time wearing these boots I wore them the entire day and they were cozy and warm. Like slippers.  I wear a 6 and ordered a 6 and the fit is perfect!!<br />Warning..... if you don’t like attention, don’t order these!!!  I can not wear these without receiving compliments continuously😊"
5.0,Nautical look is durable yet feminine. Fits my Apple watch perfectly! Easy to wipe off to keep clean too.
5.0,"I was a little uncertain about these boots, due to another reviewer who posted about a strange woman printed on the design.  However, I took a chance and when I received my boots found that Iron Man was clearly visible on the print graphics.  I now believe the woman seen on the other boots was a character similar to Black Widow or Captain Marvel.  So, there may be a bit of an unlicensed Marvel theme to these boots, which ended up being a positive bonus for us.  These boots seem very comfortable with the soft fur lining and have proven durable against the wet weather and snow for the limited periods that they have seen exposure to the elements.  The boots were quite easy to put on our 1-year old and that was a significant factor in the purchase to buy these boots, as many leading manufacturers did not offer boots that would be easy to place onto an infant's foot.  Overall, very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"A little larger than expected, but otherwise I love this dress. It's not too long and it is very comfortable."
5.0,Came on time and made a great Mother's  Day gift....
5.0,Excellent design. Fits comfortably.
5.0,Absolutely adorable
5.0,The color is bright and eye catching. I will definitely buy more colors!
5.0,My favorite flip flop.<br />Everyone comments on how good it looks

5.0,Great purse as described
5.0,"Fits well, very pretty."
5.0,"These are great so far. I like the metal that so far hasn't made my ear have any problems. I like the flat backs that dont jab. The screw top are a little trick to get, but otherwise these are great. Also great price"
5.0,Very flattering and we'll made! You can't beat the price for this super sexy & classy swim suit!
5.0,Love it 👍
5.0,"This is the second one of these that I purchased and I love them. The only reason I had to buy another is that I lost the watch that the first one was on, not at all due to a problem with the product. After buying another watch and wearing it for a couple of months, the rubber band that came with it started irritating my skin due to sweat and rubbing. Had to buy another of these because it is the most comfortable and cute watch band I have ever had!"
5.0,I got a large cuz<br />I wanted more of a loose look and it is my fav jacket !! Super warm!!
5.0,Quality is great for the price and it arrived in the mail very quickly!

5.0,"Love love love<br />Great fit. I'm 240, xl fits comfortably"
5.0,Cute leotard. My daughter loves wearing it to gymnastics!
5.0,I bought this as a little something for myself while I was Christmas shopping. The quality is much nicer that I expected so I ended up wearing it on Christmas Day with some leather looming skinny jeans. It's so attractive and comfy that I washed it and wore it the very next day to a party! I wish there were more colors. I'd buy another!
5.0,Absolutely love this bracelet. Amazing quality thick band. I get tons of compliments on it.
5.0,Love it!!!!! Wore it for a month straight! Super cute
5.0,These are great... legs feel great after the first day..easy on and off..will order more
5.0,"This is a wonderfully styled hoodie based off the Devil May Cry series! Even if you are not,  it is a stylish hoodie in itself. It does seem a bit more off red than in the picture. You can also layer with this outfit. Perfect for spring and fall type weather! Definitely will get a second just for fun!"
5.0,"Excellent, very elegant, beautiful item"
5.0,Just pure classic. My son loves this watch.
5.0,Good one! My friend loved it!
5.0,"A little long on me, but only because I'm short. They're perfect otherwise."
5.0,Beautifully crafted.  I used as a wall hanging in my meditation room.
5.0,"Purchased for my wife, she loves it, fits a little large though but still manageable."
5.0,[[VIDEOID:612d666293bb215655f6ed5b9e1b5b64]] Super cute. Love the protective bag they came in and they came package well.
5.0,Love the new goggles
5.0,"Greet price, awesome colors, easy to find in my purse."

5.0,"cool hat..i have an enormous head and this hat is a lil big on my mellon. No way i can wear it in the wind, but i love it"
5.0,"Matches the necklace my daughter has, it's beautiful"
5.0,Pretty and fun. Exactly as pictured.
5.0,Perfect for cardigans or slip one sweaters. Great layered. Washes and dried very fast.
5.0,Awesome quality straps that are budget friendly. Don’t overpay for $40-$50 straps that are identical!
5.0,Wonderful Fit!
5.0,Looked.like good quality but they did not fit
5.0,Bought these hoping they would fit.  They did and I love them!
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful bag. Bought for my daughter, hasn't been used yet, so I can't verify how well it will hold up, but appears to be very sturdy. It arrived on time and is exactly as expected."
5.0,Pretty cool mask
5.0,That sandals  is beautiful  fit perfectly
5.0,Fits well. Warm hat.
5.0,"awesome purse!<br />Plenty of space for things, easy and light weight very comfortable to wear all day! Really good quality highly recommend!"
5.0,"This top is AMAZING!!! I was skeptical about the whole built in bra thing, but honestly it offers fantastic support without giving any kind of sports bra uni-boob. I’m 5’7” and about 135 lbs. I have a 36 inch bust and 25 inch waist and I’m blown away that this top fits so perfectly. Ordered the XS because I didn’t want anything slipping out while running. Will definitely be ordering more!!!"
5.0,"I bought this purse because I needed a roomy tote in which to carry a lot of stuff.  The quality and craftsmanship is of top quality - anything Patricia Nash is top notch.  I also liked the colors used in this pattern.  The catch at the top is different, but is easy enough to use, and is secure.  I prefer zippers, not magnetic clasps, but I feel this is as secure as a zipper. Because I like this tote so well, I do have it in another pattern which I purchased elsewhere."
5.0,the shirt is beautiful
5.0,They seem to keep my daughters hands warm and for her very well.
5.0,"Their a  low price, you get multiple and are well made! The only thing I would say is that the 1/2 (the latest ones) are 16 gauge. So other than that there great!"
5.0,Daughter likes these for school
5.0,Perfect new condition. Authentic and fast delivery!
5.0,"This is the second time I bought these. Great masks, very comfortable. They hold up to washing very well."
5.0,The only thing I wasn't thrilled about are the arms as they are baggy so I will take the dress to an alteration shop to fix that. Totally worth it because its beautiful and very classy looking.
5.0,I bought this sweater from a celtic shop and it was similarly priced. I really enjoy wearing it a year later. I get compliments all of the time. It is a comfy sweater in 60 degree weather and keeps me warm even into the 30s!
5.0,"Love this! It’s so cute under a denim jacket or to wear by itself. It’s definitely a cropped fit but has a good amount of stretch. I am typically an XL in tops and got my normal size, it’s fits great!"
5.0,Love these leg warmers! They fit very well and keep my legs warm.
5.0,"I purchased the 30"" chain -- it's very pretty and delicate, and a good value for the price."
5.0,"These are great sandals to wear around the house because they are so comfortable. They also look great. This is my second pair, the first one lasted for over 8 years with daily use around the house."
5.0,Very soft and cuddly . Love that the belt is sewn on and the hood is great too . Easy to wash and looks great . I also use these to put on my Granddaughters when they come out of the pool
5.0,"Really, really have enjoyed this, wearing sever times since purchase!  Beautiful piece."
5.0,Tiny nugget delight!
5.0,Wow. Can't believe how great this is.
5.0,El vestido muy fino y el precio exelente mi hija tiene nueve años  y pesa 64 libras le quedó perfecto talla 8
5.0,This is a good product. I bought them as a gift and she loved them. Great price for what you get.
5.0,"Great sweater, decent quality. Color is accurate to seller pictures. I bought the ""magenta"" one and it's definitely closer to the plum/aubergine that's in the picture than it is to magenta, which is what I was hoping for, so I'm happy with it!"
5.0,My mom n law loves the look of this scarf and said it's the warmest one she's had. Got the gloves to go with it as well. She loves them both!
5.0,"Very flattering dress, light material and not see through, which I appreciate.<br />I feel so comfortable on a hot day. Perfect length for a new mom.<br />Cute for a date. Definitely my favorite one for summer!<br />Medium size is perfect for 5'7 height and 150 Ibs"
5.0,"These fit quite well - good stretchy material that doesn't loosen with wear throughout the day.  I would recommend these for sure, great for workouts and/or just walking around, really."
5.0,"I have a Galaxy S9 Plus and it fit perfectly. At first it is a little hard to close the wallet with the phone but it just needs a little bending and it'll work, it needed to be ""broken into"". I would not recommend putting coins into this wallet with your cellphone. It will not close. Keep your number of credit cards limited as well. It is perfect for a night out and about as the strap is definitely handy!"
5.0,"The fit is great for my body type but I do think if you have bigger boobs the top may be an issue as it is pretty small. As a member of the itty bitty titty committee, I don’t have any complaints from the top. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,"This is a gift so I cannot attest to the quality of wear however, I am very pleased with the quality and the price."
5.0,This worked great for having a small purse in my carry on while traveling.
5.0,This was a nice scarf and bought one for my daughter also.  The pocket is nice to have when you do not want to carry purse. I like the length and it is warm.
5.0,The ratchet feature on this belt is awesome. It provides a perfect fit and doesn't wear out the band like a normal belt.
5.0,"Nice looking, appears to be built well, very stylish product as nice as some fancy store brands that cost many multiples of the price."
5.0,Very soft and true to size robe. I feel like the quality is much better compared to the price. I definitely recommend.
5.0,just fine - finally found what I was looking for
5.0,Fits nicely. Loved it!!!
5.0,Great sandal for the locker room. Just what I had hope for. Light and comfortable. Will be good for the summer too!
5.0,These are perfect since they keep my hands warm in the cooler weather.
5.0,I Love
5.0,"I bought these to help with my chronic migraines. Rather than go straight to the meds my doc wanted to prescribe, I decided to try these. A severe migraine I had been battling for a month was gone in one day of using these at work. I'm a medical secretary, and am under fluorescent lighting all day, as well as staring at a computer screen for most of my shift. I got the yellow tinted ones. They come with a decent case, and a lense microfiber cloth. Mine do not have any magnification to them, since my vision did not require that. For the price they are a steal. Plus I've received many compliments on how they look, which is just a nice bonus."
5.0,"Good fit, super cute shoes"
5.0,"I'm 5'7 at 195 pounds and bought this in an extra large. love love love lOVE it. If you have a fashionable pin or pins, you can wear this as a wrap dress!  A seamstress could make a hole with buttons to wear as a wrap dress as well. As a dress it will be very modest. Another item to dress up and down."
5.0,The hat was a perfect fit and very classy.  It was exactly what I needed for the Downton Abbey Tea I attended.
5.0,"I'm really picky about purses, this one is perfect."
5.0,Good quality. Very pleased.
5.0,Costume was perfect for my pizza 5k. It's light in weight and comfortable.
5.0,My husband loves funky socks so I got him these for Christmas.  He loved them and they are soooo soft.  I even wear them sometimes.
5.0,This is so soft and flattering! Big girl review here!
5.0,Great looking also
5.0,"I have more compliments on these earrings than any I own, these are faux stones but are sized and constructed with good workmanship. I chose these over  my genuine turquoise. If they are lost I can replace them, I sometimes take genuine gemstone earrings to a bench at local jeweler and ask they be used in rings, rings are not as easily lost. If you have trouble finding earrings with long posts which do not work out of your ear lobe these are a great pair to buy/"
5.0,Fits true to size!
5.0,The are exactly as described and very nice perfect for small promo keychains!
5.0,Exactly what I needed for reading and great style
5.0,Good quality my daughters loved it !!
5.0,"I have been looking for a sunglass strap that was long, could attach securely close to the frame and not loosen with time. These met those criteria 100%. I own about 20 pairs of sunglasses, so I have replaced all of those cords with these. If you find that they are too long, they are fully adjustable."
5.0,"I bought this to wear over my short wedding dress as I was decorating my venue with friends and family, and it was perfect! Beautiful and comfortable. We did our &#34;first look&#34; pictures with me slowly taking it off to reveal my dress."
5.0,"Ok, not really.... but these are great tank tops!  They're my new favorites for the hot Florida weather.  Love the material, the cut, and quality.  Definitely shows off shoulder and back muscles."
5.0,Great deal for the money!
5.0,"Color is rich and beautiful, fabric is soft and flows well.. size small fit me perfect @5'1,115lbs"
5.0,I LOVE IT!!!
5.0,"Great wallet! I only ever carry a few cards, and this is the perfect slim wallet to fit in my pants without making any type of marks on my jeans."
5.0,"Item arrived quickly to my home and in a gift box. The watch is very pretty and works perfectly. I really needed a waterproof watch since I wash my hands very, very often. The waterproof leather is a great bonus even though it is a bit stiff at first."
5.0,It came earlier than expected and I love it.
5.0,Too CUTE!!  Cute with tights and boots great for fall!
5.0,Perfect size shipped it really fast and quality satisfaction...
5.0,I love it! Perfect size. Cute matching wallet
5.0,I love my watch. It's awesome
5.0,"This was the perfect dress for Christmas Day. Very comfortable, but easy to dress up."
5.0,"We've been using a few products from Silly Apples and been pleased with them. This 2-pack of rompers is another nice set. The fabric is very nice -- soft and easy to clean. The designs on both rompers are fun and very cute. The price is right, too, since you get two. Overall, very nice. No complaints."
5.0,Good quality. Seems well built. Would buy again.
5.0,Skirts are very nice and comfortable
5.0,Loved it!! It was unique and everyone was asking about it in the birthday party.
5.0,Very nice shirt...pretty enough to wear anywhere!
5.0,"This dress was a great surprise. The quality for the price is awesome. I am 5’5” and a toned 160 lbs. I usually wear a medium and the medium fit like a glove, perfect on my curves. I received a lot of compliments at the formal event. I’m planning to purchase in another color for an upcoming wedding. Love this dress."
5.0,A amazing present for a special valentine
5.0,I like the fact that these can be worn the whole shift without having to switch to reading glasses if necessary.
5.0,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who wanted 'a cool watch!"" She loved it--as did her daughters and me. Great style and fits perfectly."
5.0,"With 5 kids 6 and under I have tried every bag under the sun it seems. I have searched for years for the perfect bag, and I think I finally found it. This bag is BEAUTIFUL and so spacious. I love that it can be worn so many ways and it looks like a handbag and not a diaper bag.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-It truly is a beautiful bag<br />-can be worn 3 ways<br />-TONS of organization. I like to pouch pack but the pockets are great for anyone who doesn’t like to pack in pouches<br />-it holds a TON<br />-it came with stroller straps. I wasnt expecting that so it was an amazing bonus<br />-the lining is light so things to disappear into a deep dark hole<br />-it feels very luxurious<br />-the zippers are so smooth<br /><br />Cons:<br />-so far the only negative that I have found is that it is a little on the heavy side. This definitely isn’t a deal breaker for me because I always have my stroller and hang it on there or a grocery basket."
5.0,I LOVE it! Feels comfy and fits true to size.
5.0,Worked great.  Thin!
5.0,I love my polishing cloth. I clean all my silver. I never have to pay to have it clean.
5.0,Details in pendants were great. Had to order 2 sets to make earings but it was a great item to buy.
5.0,"great kids mask, easy to wash and continue using"
5.0,"The fit is spot on, there is no pinching nor looseness. The color is true, they look exactly like they do on the Amazon website. The quality is great, there hasn't been any looseness,no wearing off of color or style."
5.0,"It is a birthday gift, so I will let you know...."
5.0,Loved everything about this flip flop
5.0,They felt a little big at first but they are true to size just have to tighten the strap more. The cushion makes it very comfortable
5.0,"Love, Love, LOVE this red laptop/briefcase!<br />The color is a deep red, not a bright red. Gorgeous.  I wasn't sure by the measurements if my laptop would fit, the pictures provided convinced me to give this bag a try. Glad I did. There is a lot of room in this bag for my computer, files, wallet,  notebook, water bottle, ect. I travel-fly weekly for work and wanted a bag that looks trendy and more like a designer handbag and not a computer bag!"
5.0,I love this shirt. This is my second one. The medium was a little bit small. I am 143 and 5”4.
5.0,nice hats bought in different colors and added a little bling to them easily enough.
5.0,"I was immediately drawn to how great this coat looked on the model. When I put it on  it looked even better on me! I especially like that it covers the rear end, That little extra coverage keeps me tremendously warmer than the more commonly featured waist length jackets; it make a big difference. I have longer arms than most, so expectedly the sleeves were a little short. Experience has shown me that the average person would not have to do this, but I carefully let down the sleeves, and it then fit me perfectly. The coat is attractive, soft, warmer and lighter than a heavy sweater, but not at all bulky as an even slightly heavy winter coat, as said, it looks great on and for the price it cannot be beat. This coat will not disappoint!."
5.0,"If you wear heels or any shoe that you don't wear socks with because they show, get these!!! I love my heels, but in the summer I usually ruin at least 1 pair from not wearing socks with them.  I got these to try and so happy I did!  The grip around the edging it awesome, these do not slip off my feet as I walk, really comfortable I can barely tell I am wearing them.  There is a tiny bit and I mean really tiny bit, that shows with a couple of my shoes, but it is only noticeable if your looking for it!  Will buy again!"
5.0,Great bag. I get compliments nd stares. Love thr handles. Trendy. The bag goes with jeans up to evening wear.
5.0,Perfect size.  Color and length.  My daughter loved it.  Recommend
5.0,"I went on a road trip/camping trip mid November through Whyoming, Utah and Colorado and needed a hat that would keep me warm.  Sleeping in a tent when it is 25° requires really warm, insulated clothing and I am soo glad I went with these.  They are incredibly thick, lined with soft fur-like fabric and are actually cute.  The size is good, not too tight or slouchy and come in pretty colors.<br />I accidentally put one of them through the wash and...It was a  mistake 😯  the fur ball melted and came off.  Learn from me and definitely get this hat...just don't put in in your washing machine."
5.0,I like this ring in the emerald color. Super cute to add to your collection at a low cost.
5.0,My almost three year old grandson wears these light weight comfortable glasses all afternoon while out and about.  I bought white and black for him and he looks so adorable/cool in both.  They seem to be very well made but we have only had for a short time so can't really testify to that yet.  A well made soft case comes with these glasses and I think deligent use of the case will certainly help keep them nice when they are not being used.
5.0,Love the looks!
5.0,I use one for my credit and health cards. There are so many pages. I like it very much
5.0,Fit watch perfect with no problems.
5.0,"Very pleased with these polarized glasses. Nice case included. Would definitely buy again (once I either break or lose them).  Really good pair for the money(less than $20 paid). I have bought ALOT of sunglasses over the years. Some of them were 3-5 times more expensive than this pair.<br />Yet, I wear these ALL the time."
5.0,Great color and fits perfectly!
5.0,"This top fits really cute and feels soft and comfy. It fit as expected. My only complaint is that there is a seam that runs down your spine.  When I tried it on, it was a little uncomfortable. After the first wash and wearing the shirt for the day, I barely noticed the seam. I would recommend."
5.0,My daughter loved it ! She just turned 7 and she is very skinny girl. I ordered a 5/6 size. It’s a two piece a tank and skirt. The outfit came just in time.
5.0,This is just as promised and a good size for most noses.
5.0,"My three year old and I love this! I always have people complementing him and asking where I got it , best part is is that you can put it on himself"
5.0,Just what my Mom wanted!
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised! Not only did I receive the dress within a couple of days, but it fits amazingly. I am 5'4&#34;, 120 lbs and ordered a small. I feel like it is nice quality fabric for how cheap it is, and I wear it nearly every week for work (I work at a mortuary) and so far it has done great in the washer and being hung to dry. The colors are very vibrant on the print. I think I might by another dress, just for when mine wears out. I love the fit!"
5.0,"I am happy with this. The shirt says its black and even the bag said black, but it looks very  dark navy blue or a faded black. I am okay with that though! I got a lot of compliments with this!!"
5.0,These tri-Glides are a very good quality rubber coated metal they are very strong you can't bend them with your hand the coating is very durable hard rubber and wont peal off.
5.0,"I am always looking at my phone screen ( games, internet, etc) and these really help. I had misplaced a month ago  so I had to use regular reading glasses and noticed a difference. Glad I found these glasses."
5.0,"Loved this so much, such good quality, I knew that it was made by Tipsy Elves and expected good quality. It was great, very thick and warm, not cheap like other Halloween costumes. Will definitely look for Tipsy Elves costumes next year."
5.0,"Ahhhhh! Love it!! Was hesitant with the size since it was coming from China, but for perfect. Material was nice and silky feeling."
5.0,"But I loved the fabric and the design, I just need to ask for a bigger size."
5.0,"I’m SO glad I bought this. Very form fitting, great length, sexy, not see through"
5.0,I ordered these for my 4 yr old and he absolutely loves them. As quickly as their feet grow you won't be disappointed especially for the price. Will be ordering the next size up.
5.0,So good for running. I like my shorts short and they are perfect. My iPhone X doesn’t even move during a long run. I’ve been running 10+ miles and forget the phone is even there. Highly suggest.
5.0,"Very cute and fits and looks good even when your 65, go for it you'll luv it.  😆😆"
5.0,"I like how the fit is so perfect. Also the Sherpa lining is amazingly warm. I live in Big Bear California and when I put this hoodie on, I feel like no cold can get through me. Specially at night when its freezing.<br /><br />I highly recommend these hoodies if you live in a cold place like mines. Big Bear California."
5.0,i loved the fit it was perfect .Very good quality
5.0,Really enjoy wearing this necklace. Might buy more later. Really enjoy Irish jewelry for men am thinking about a ring.
5.0,Fun yet practical and made from a real golf ball!  It's a simple bottle opener but seems well made and comes with a carabiner to easily attach it to a golf bag.  Great little stocking stuffer for the golfer in your life.
5.0,Very comfortable and well made coat. It's as true to size as can be and warm enough to throw on to run here and there this winter.
5.0,Price and quality
5.0,"I either get them too big , like I’m wearing a tent and too small like I’m Pugsly from the Adams family. This fit perfectly, like they asked us and listened this time. Not too loose not at all right. I would recommend."
5.0,Love it. about three inches to long if you wear flats. But I love it.
5.0,Great gift!.
5.0,"The zipper gets snagged on the flap when I try to zip-up the shoe ,other than this the shoe fits and looks good."
5.0,This is a beautiful bag it has a big top zipper tote and then a open pocket in the front. Beautiful designed on the bag.  I'm looking forward to use it I have a cell phone handbag from this company and I love the product.
5.0,"Beautiful, soft and elegant.  This was a big hit with my daughter, she loves it."
5.0,I love this shirt. I would order it again in another color.
5.0,"I got this to attach to my bouquet at my wedding with a photo of my late best friend. It was perfect for the price. Made well, perfect size, not too small not too big either. Giving to another friend in our group to use at her wedding as well."
5.0,I have been using compression socks after a Lisfranc injury 9 months ago. I usually use the sports sock style that is shorter than this pair. This goes all the way up to just below my knee. They are not too difficult to get on like some compression socks. Just roll them down into a ball when applying; stick your toes inside then work the ball back over your foot. At the end of the day I felt they did keep my swelling down although the tight fit all the way up my leg was more than I would like most days. I will definitely use these when I have long periods of sitting while traveling in a car or plane. Recommended.
5.0,I loved the details at the bottom! It was a perfect dress for our wedding shower!
5.0,"These are the first women's sunglasses I have found in years that are both classy and polarized. The lenses are a nice, reasonable size and the frames are not overly fancy to make me feel silly wearing them. The lenses are somewhat darker than they need to be, given they are polarized, but I am overall very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,Our daughter loves these shoes. I bought one size up as recommended.
5.0,"These look great with [[ASIN:B00II5LJPO Elegant Moments Women's Plus-Size Queen Size Mini Skirt, Black/Gold, 1X/2X]]<br /><br />So if you buy these HOT boots you def got to get the skirt as well and visa versa!!!!  HOT HOT HOT!!!!"
5.0,Love them. Looks like I'm in a Harry Potter movie

5.0,Such a beautiful dress.  I love it and it’s so simple but you can wear it ffor a date or some
5.0,Got this in white with black Reebok lettering on lower part of top.  Really like it.  Great padding. White never last that long but I don't care. Love it.
5.0,EOM
5.0,"Love this dress, soft material, very flattering fit for a large bust and curvy body. No side boob and the armpits fit perfectly on a short person. I’m 5’2”. Buy.The.dress!"
5.0,Looks and feels good.  Got a lot of compliments on this scarf.  Might consider buying more since there's so many colors to choose from.
5.0,Length makes it perfect to wear to work even.
5.0,This jacket is way better than it looks in the picture
5.0,"I seriously love these slippers! I have had them for years and they are the best. They are definitely warn in now and they aren’t as soft as the used to be, but that’s to be expected with how much I wear them! I would buy these 100 times over again because they have held up so well!"
5.0,Very very cute
5.0,Very cute !!!
5.0,"Big surprise.  Great color,  price and fit<br />I prefer 100% cotton but this will definitely do- planning on getting a few more because the colors are so great"
5.0,The sizing is PERFECT on these. I even wore them to bed on purpose to see if the calf would get stretched out and if the socks would start to fall down and they didn't. These are great fitting and feeling compression socks with 3 subtle designs that you can wear this with formal dress pants or jeans.<br /><br />I will look to this exact brand in the future for other socks.
5.0,Great quality!  Husband loved it!
5.0,"Fits good, use all the time."
5.0,Very nice quality. It does everything I need for a card holder.
5.0,"These are the cutest flip flops.  The fit is perfect and they are very comfortable.  I love that the strap is all material.  No need for breaking them in, they are comfortable from the start."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful item. Just what I was looking for. My daughter was looking for a cover up that could pass as a shirt for a trip to Florida and this one fits the bill. Well made and really perfect for summer.  As you can see from the picture she's curvey and it fits her perfect. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,"Everything in it's place, better packaging than I was expecting, great color and texture."
5.0,"Got this as a gift,  such a cute design. True to size."
5.0,I LOVE THIS WATCH. IT IS SO UNIQUE.
5.0,"These are great if you don’t want to stick to one color, my son loves to change it up with these to match his clothes and uses them for color runs"
5.0,These showed up early and are beautiful! I would say they are more of a blue black then a true black but they are a great price for a great product.
5.0,"This jacket is not for cold Winter weather, but ideal for cooler days (35-55F). It’s looser in fit and very long. I’m 5’7” and it hits just above my knee. It’s exactly what I was looking for, but should have ordered an XS, not a S. I’m 32B and size small in tops."
5.0,These are so pretty.
5.0,Awesome fit...very flattering
5.0,Fits really well and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
5.0,Hermoso 💚
5.0,my boyfriend loved these (: thank you so much!
5.0,This was very beautiful! great quality.
5.0,The material is soft and it's very comfortable and cool. Love the pockets.  Fits perfectly.
5.0,"This suit is way too cute. I wanted a new swim suit that fits my long torso and can cover my tummy since I haven’t lost weight, and this did not disappoint! I’m 5’8, and so glad it’s long enough, it’s a cute design to even just wear as a tank top. It has padding for the breasts and I love that, it makes my breasts look great but it’s not a too revealing swim suit. The bottoms are cute and don’t flatten my butt out like other high waisted bottoms. I’m glad I bought this, for a reference, I bought an XL. Would recommend and probably buy another one."
5.0,"I love this top, comfortable, strong, and holds up to a lot of movement!"
5.0,I been searching for this band for a while now for my Subaqua. The band is strong than the original one. Thank you!!!
5.0,"I ordered this for a Potter fest, and it exceeded my expectations. Must buy for any Harry Potter fans"
5.0,Good fitting and color
5.0,Very soft. Comfy. Perfect fit!
5.0,My boyfriend loves it & the material is so soft & it's thick enough to wear on a cold day.
5.0,Product is just like the picture so beautiful and vibrant colors
5.0,"Bought my husband a few different brands of silicone rings, from cheap to most expensive, and this was our favorite. It did stretch after 4 years and he lost it, so I ordered a new one. Color is great and subtle and the profile is perfect - not too thick and not too thin. Wish there were women’s ones from this company."
5.0,"Yeah, my band also tore, but a drop of glue on it did the trick.  It still stretches just fine and the next tear will get the same repair.  Also, the stem is subject to being pulled out if wearing a long sleeve shirt that rubs up and down against it.  Otherwise, I love it!  It feels so good on my wrist, much more comfortable than a metal stretch band and so much easier to put on than a &#34;find the hole&#34; band.  And best of all people, please remember, this is a $9.00 watch.  I bought 3 of them in case they stop making them."
5.0,"We got these socks for our 10-1/2 hour flight from California to England (and back).  While we still got up and walked as often as we could (we tried for at least every hour), these socks with their snug fit actually made our legs feel good at the end of the flight.  We also wore them on days that would see us on the tour bus for long periods of time, traveling from city to city, where we couldn't easily get up and stroll around.  They would be a little difficult to get on and off if you had hand problems, such as arthritis, but we were able to get them on and off without problems."
5.0,These are as good as any other high priced name brands I have bought in the past. Good quality & good price. I will buy more when I wear out the ones I bought. Good moisture wicking.
5.0,Just beautiful!!!! I totally recommend it!
5.0,Love the softness and durability waiting to buy again when they are in stock again
5.0,"Had Carpal tunnel surgery and was unable to wear a watch.<br />Its long chain makes it easy to slide over your head.<br />This is beautiful, inexpensive, and keeps perfect time:)"
5.0,"I love these - you have to be careful that you don't stretch them, but I have a small wrist and was excited that they fit!"
5.0,Perfect replacement for the stock Zenwatch 3 band.
5.0,I am 5'4 180 lbs and I buy the large and it fits good love it love it love it
5.0,My daughter won't take it off.. she says its so snuggley...
5.0,This dress is super comfortable and I love the pockets.  I work at a school and have gotten a lot of compliments from parents and fellow teachers.
5.0,Well made and beautiful!
5.0,This Extra Large size was too snug for me so I gave this one to a neighbor who is very pleased with it.<br />She wears a size 16 top and says this XL is just perfect.
5.0,"Shirt fit as expected. It’s just a simple solid color shirt, nothing fancy. Can be paired with jeans for casual day or with slacks for a dressier evening."
5.0,very good quality and inexpensive. feels good on my shoulder while i'm playing.
5.0,They hold the kiddos glasses no problem
5.0,Nice and large good for traveling can pack it full. Not good for everyday use to large. Keep it the back on my car when I come home from the stores I load it and only have one bag to carry in the house. Love it!!!
5.0,I have some older bracelets and necklaces that are just a hair too short. These extenders are exactly what I needed to make them fit!
5.0,Great watch band.
5.0,Ordered larger size
5.0,So many compliments received from wearing this watch. Great product.
5.0,"Semi-loosely measured, my waist measures 35 inches, so I ordered XXX-Large (32-34 inches). It's fairly comfortable to wear (surprisingly enough), and I may order another 2 to 3 sizes smaller to give thinner look for when I cosplay characters like Belle from Beauty and the Beast and Mulan from Disney's version of Mulan. This is such a comfortable wear, and love it!"
5.0,Light weight /chain was just right
5.0,Love this charm and was exactly as described and more. I have received alot of compliments on the charm I purchased
5.0,"Very pretty, lots of compliments"
5.0,Love my bag it is very good quality. Perfect to carry my extras for work. It gets a lot of compliments.
5.0,Nice Halloween set. But size up
5.0,This wound up being even cuter than I expected.  It perfectly set off a gray & black outfit.
5.0,What a fantastic product<br />Runs small buy one size larger than normal<br />I did it was great
5.0,"The color is nearly black, but that's what I was looking for."
5.0,"I gave this to my niece and she loved it.<br />Perfect for camp,beach or just everyday.<br />The color and durability are perfect"
5.0,Did just what I needed.
5.0,I like the make of cup and the size.  Great craftsmanship.
5.0,Just as the picture showed. He loved it. Will buy again from same company !
5.0,"This is my second one, the first one broke on the inside copper and couldn't wear it, it hurt where it touched.  I wear a copper bracelet on both arms 24/7 and have since I discovered how much they help me.  I have several now and change when I want something different."
5.0,would have loved it but way to small
5.0,Good fabric. Thicker than expected.
5.0,"Christmas gift for my husband this year, since he is a new jeep owner. Really high quality cap. Exceeded my expectations!"
5.0,Permit fit on my watch band
5.0,"It’s a beautiful nose ring, but the pole is very short and the bend at the end is even shorter!  Unless you have a paper thin nose you won’t be able to ware this ring.  I straightened it out and it still barely came through inside.  I’m very disappointed because I can’t sport it! 😔"
5.0,Ease of usage en elegant design are the major highlights of this belt. Good buy en recommended!
5.0,I got this for me and my best friend they were pretty but they did tarnish fairly quickly.
5.0,Good material look great. Luce bien buen material
5.0,Much easier than regular shirts after rotator cuff surgery.  Wash well.
5.0,This fits really well and I was so excited because usually I cant order a single thing off the internet due to the way I am sized lol.
5.0,They are very comfortable and fit like a glove
5.0,This is absolutely gorgeous!!  My sister's and I are going as the Sanderson sisters this Halloween.  Can't wait to be Winnie in this stunning outfit!  Definitely not costume material!!
5.0,"Excellent buy ,I am very happy with quality and design as well as performance ,overall great product for the money"
5.0,"This is a watch that can cast shadows to your wrist watch collection.<br />I bought it in Argentina. So you wont find the &#34;verified purchase&#34; sign on this review. But I guess these pieces are all of the same sort. Mine was made in Thailand. I adquired it for the gym, but I cant get if off my wrist. I like diver watches, I own a Seiko skx007, an Orient ray blue, even an Omega Seamaster. But the de F91w gets most of my wrist time and I think I know why:<br />-It is light as a feather. Being used to diver watches as I mentioned, wearing a light watch is very comfy.<br />-It is very thin. Not obstrusive at all.<br />-It is very accurate. It wins about one second every 10 days so it keeps time pretty accurately. If you have it on it goes faster, if you dont, goes a bit slower (body temperature). But you can always zero it up (back) if it is between 1 and 29 seconds o (forward) if it is between 31 and 59 seconds. So if you dont let it go further or backward more than 29 seconds you can adjust it just by pressing the right button on *adjust* mode.<br />-Its dial is very clear. Contrasty. You can see it at every angle.<br />-The watch is small *but* what I realize is that being a small watch it is not important as far as the *digits* are not small. Which is what tells you the time.<br />-Night light is dim but enough to show you the time at dark. I gess more potent light compromise the duration of the battery, so I am happy with a longer battery life and light enough to see the time at dark.<br />-Stop watch is very useful for cooking and other infinite tasks. I use it a lot to time driving times to deliver goods and put it down so I can schedule my delivery shift more accurately.<br />-It can be used as a morning wake up alarm while travelling but, if you have heavy sleep, you can put it in a mug on the bedside table (see picture) to beep more loudly directing your head. It works.<br />I think is a watch everyone should try. I was skeptical at the begining but once I bought it I discovered that the watch looks better personally than in pictures. And is very, very comfortable. I hope this review helps to whoever reads it. Greetings from Argentina."
5.0,Super cute! Runs in Chinese sizes so order up a size but came pretty fast and is absolutely adorable
5.0,My daughter really likes them for her job.
5.0,I use this at work. I work in a cooler most of the day and these are perfect for layering. I also use them for walking. They are perfect for both things.
5.0,"I am 5' tall and 130 lbs, 22 weeks pregnant and this dress is so perfect!! I am lovin the material, so soft and it is so flowy.. i got small size and the length is just so perfect. I am inlove with this dress!! ❤"
5.0,Product as described. Beautiful.
5.0,These fit my 22 month old perfectly! True to size! It totally completed her costume!
5.0,Beautiful top.....and the fit was perfect.
5.0,Nice shirt and a good deal. I'm happy I bought it
5.0,"Great, it held my backpack for five countries and is great for more countries."
5.0,"Love the fit and true to photo. But the fabric is super light (not sheer, just light). So they aren’t ideal for winter"
5.0,"The jacket definitely helps keep the cold out when running the heat, but it's not so thick as to be too warm for a fall jacket. The pockets are a little small, my phone doesn't fit great. I charge the battery maybe once a week or 2. The material seems to work well for repelling water as well, has kept me quite dry in the rain."
5.0,"The service provided was excellent and so was the product, however one of its functions, the light to illuminate the face in dark environments, is not of sufficient quality or brightness to provide sufficient illumination in dark conditions. This is not the case with past Casio watches of this type that I've purchased over the  years."
5.0,Looks nice. I wish it was a bit heavier
5.0,"Elegant bracelet, will purchase again."
5.0,Love these comfortable and good sun protection!
5.0,Love this dress! It’s super cute and will be perfect for a wedding I’m attending at the end of May. It’s made well and the fabric isn’t super thin. The fabric is also a bit stretchy. I ordered my normal size and it fit perfectly.
5.0,These were bought to augment diamond studs set in white gold.  Great choice.
5.0,Such a cute bag! Doesn't hold a lot but perfect for a the essentials.
5.0,I saw this in a boutique for twice the price. I ordered this same shirt. It fits great I am a size XL. I love it. I get lots of compliments!!
5.0,I was very hesitant after reading so many negative reviews for this sweater. I ordered the Khaki color so I cannot speak for other colors. It is soft and it is oversized as stated and falls off my shoulder as it does in the picture. I wear a 10-12 shirt and am 160lbs. I ordered the medium and had plenty of room and is the perfect comfy bagginess I was hoping for. Such a cute sweater and very good customer service from this specific company!!
5.0,I love it it’s a bit snug wish they had 1x other then that must buy so many Complements
5.0,Loved it. Fit my 4 year old son so well. He looked so handsome with it.
5.0,"Love these pants - have every color!  The fit is true to fit.  I have taught fitness classes for 25 years and this quality and creativity comes along almost never for this price.  Really, I don't get any of the negative reviews that talk about quality.  They are just as pictured.  One thing I would say is that the material is not thick - so if that's what you are going for, these may not be for you. However, I could not love them more."
5.0,Absolutely loved these. Especially happy that two were included. My son and grandson looked so wonderful when they lit the Chanukah candles.
5.0,This dream catcher set is stunningly beautiful. But please buy from your local Native American artists if you’re able to.
5.0,Perfect fit and great lenses.
5.0,Great idea with the cuff links having the American flag. They are awesome. The only thing is that the Stars and Stripes are in the top left corner which makes it so the flag isn't facing forward on both sides but that's no fault of the design without altering the flag. Great product.
5.0,"This nightgown  is soft, it;s warm and soo cuddly! I love it!"
5.0,"I absolutely loved this purse. It was exactly what I was looking for. Its small and compact but I can still fit a somewhat bigger wallet, my make up bag (as big as an ipsy bag), cell phone and sunglasses. My favorite part is the adjustable strap because I am only 5 foot and crossbody purses tend to hit my legs and look super weird/ill fitting  on me. So I was able to custom fit the strap to my short height which was awesome. I also really liked the simplicity of the bag and the heart adornment."
5.0,This was a good purchase.
5.0,Beautiful charm love it
5.0,"My daughter is solidly a 3T. I got the 3T/4T and it’s a tad loose in the butt area, but I think that’s to be expected since it’s a 3T/4T. So I think it fits as expected. It’s super cute and I like that the straps up top are adjustable."
5.0,"The graphics are so cute! The shirt itself is very soft and fits me like I expect a medium size to.  I haven’t washed it yet or used it in Jazzercise yet, but I don’t foresee any problems."
5.0,Nice shorts with pocket!
5.0,My all-time favorite earrings!
5.0,Very nice for the money.
5.0,Our granddaughter put it on immediately and wore it for her birthday. Big hit.
5.0,"So easy to put on the watch. And good looking, too"
5.0,"Loved this necklace for the charms and the varying lengths.  The charms are very pretty, too!"
5.0,These packing cubes were great when packing for a trip internationally.  They compacted the space in my suitcase and I had extra room in my suitcase.  I would recommend buying these packing cubes.
5.0,Relieves my ankles from swelling.
5.0,Gorgeous set of unique looking ring findings.
5.0,Quality appears to be quite good but I have used for only 2 days.  Definitely cuts down the glare from my computer monitor.  I suspect I will notice less eye strain the more I use them.  Great buy!!
5.0,"Great sunglasses, one of my favorite brands."
5.0,"I always have trouble with traditional watch straps because each hole either makes them too loose or too tight for me. I had a different elastic one for a while, but over time, it lost its stretch. This one is great because not only is it stretchy, it also has a slide adjustment to make the fit perfect. It is also very soft and comfortable."
5.0,My son and nephew birthday
5.0,Comfortable and durable. I would liked to have had a smaller size.  I have really skinny wrists.
5.0,Cutest swimsuit I have owned in many years.
5.0,Excelente compra
5.0,Everyone needs a new look every once in a while.
5.0,Beautiful color and made well! My new favorite
5.0,"This is my second pair.  Great glasses, the optics are at least as good as my Maui Jims.  Maybe better.  Great guarantee.  Have not had to access it."
5.0,Love them I bought 6 of them😍
5.0,My husband loves his new hat!!
5.0,Fits my 8 year old perfect and rough and tumble like him
5.0,"It fits just the way I wanted it to and the color is bright!!  I've worn and washed it and hung it to dry. From shoulder to bottom it measures 30""."
5.0,Great boot for the price!
5.0,Arrived as promised on time. Box was squished up from shipment. But all was still usable and clean for home use at least
5.0,"Good bag, lock on the cheap side, had to upgrade."
5.0,Fits perfectly looks good
5.0,Perfect fit true to size chart. Great quality material and very comfortable!!
5.0,"This is the perfect bag for shopping and evenings out. My iPhone frequently gets low when out and about, but this little bag provides the extra power I need, a zipper compartment as well as a place for your ID and a credit card. The quality of the leather is excellent, soft but durable. There is an extra clasp on the outside for keys. You will need to purchase an adapter for your iPhone and I chose to purchase a cozy to secure the connection. I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter!"
5.0,Loved it. Everyone loved it.
5.0,"I ordered this around 10am and received it the very next morning, Amazon is great!  One piece of the seat was warped a bit, but I put it at the front edge and it just sort of looks like it's meant to be that way for my comfort.  There were no holes drilled in the back of the seat for the extra supports, so I had to drill them myself, which wasn't as fun as I had hoped because I couldn't find the perfect drill bit.  Directions are a bit sparse as they only showed the entire assembled chair with screws and nuts flying to the general area where they were to go, but not too hard to figure out.<br /><br />I live on the third floor and my deck is on the top floor of that 3rd floor, so it was a hard trek up.  But now it's assembled and I'm very please with it.  Sturdy and good quality."
5.0,"A little bigger than I expected (should have read measurements more closely) but a great bag, looks and feels like real leather. Very roomy and slouches just right!"
5.0,Nice necklace. Bought of gift.
5.0,"This hat is great for any kid that loves Fantasia and especially the Sorcerer's Apprentice.  It's made very well and is very durable, trust me I have a four year old and it has already been through the wash a couple times.  It also has a band inside the hat that allows it to be adjusted.  Great Purchase!!"
5.0,Great dress. Looks good and has just enough stretch. Highly recommended.
5.0,Great product.work fine so far.
5.0,"Arrived prior to due date, fits nicely. Totally recommend"

5.0,"They are just the right size. Always a big plus, they didn't irritate my ears."
5.0,"Solid metal, spring base"
5.0,Bc these are high waisted they also slim. One of my favorites. The flare isn’t as pronounced but they’re so cute I’ve had coworkers order them too.
5.0,Se ajusta muy bien a mi cabeza y nes imposibles que pueda caer cabello a los alimentos
5.0,Prompt and exactly as advertised.
5.0,"After some trouble with no way to ask questions of the seller I was forced to ask customers about the fit of this shoe. This shoe is listed as a medium width and says that equals a D width shoe. No other shoe in medium or even wide is wide enough for me. Customers came forward and answered that thier sizes of D and EE width fit exactly. This is unlikely in most medium width shoes but they fit perfectly. PLUS these come withgreat arch supports! I can't believe that someone is making my shoe size as a ""medium""."
5.0,"elegante , me encanto"
5.0,These are SO freaking adorable.

5.0,Really like it a lot. I find it perfectly comfortable. Not sure why I'd pay any more.

5.0,just what i expected i like it
5.0,Great visor for the price! It’s really nice looking and a great way to support the Buckeyes!
5.0,So this dress is super short !!!! Also make sure you wear some kind of shorts under neath because if the wind kicks just right .... well you get some friends.
5.0,"I use this set all the time and have loved it since I purchased it! The goggles are super comfortable, and I love the integrated ear plugs. The cap is also comfortable and fits my long shoulder length hair perfectly. I recommend this set to anyone!"
5.0,As ordered. Works perfectly.
5.0,Worked good for beach vb league in CT in OCT/NOV although towards the end not much was going to keep your feet warm when the sand got really cold.
5.0,Not very stylist....very effective though. Does every thing as advertised!
5.0,"It is made of metal, looks somewhat like a real tiara instead of a toy. I love it and recommend it."

5.0,"This checkbook cover is adorable.  Great price, excellent quality, and outstanding product delivery.  Thanks."

5.0,"For slightly ""dress up"" evenings"
5.0,"Great colors.  Looks good, has hole in the top for a pony tail (or not)."
5.0,I use it as an all around sneaker/shoe.
5.0,Fits tight so better for a athlete fit person and order a size larger than needed.
5.0,LOVE IT HOLDS ALL MY EYE SHADOWS
5.0,"The 11-year-old boy who received this was overwhelmed by how cool this Camaro baseball cap was. It is beautiful,, understated but with a little bling metalic details on the on the sides of the visor. I was impressed. It looked much than the picture on the Internet.. I highly recommend this cap."
5.0,"Got these pins as a present for my mom, and she loves them. They are a little too big for my liking, but she loves the size. The packaging is cute and the pins just look amazing."
5.0,"I recently ordered a pair of their shoe trees for my work shoes and have been impressed with how they work to maintain the shape of the shoes and reduce the smell. However, when they arrived a small piece of the shoe tree had fallen off as shown in the picture. I contacted the seller about the issue and they assured me of their quality products being inspected before they are packaged, so the problem occurred during shipping. They offered to send me another pair of shoe trees as a result of my experience. Overall this is a great product and has a great customer service department. I will order from them again in the future."
5.0,"I bought these two months ago and use them to store wet food items in the refrigerator for about two weeks at a time. Yes, they do smell like toasted popcorn, but I don't find the smell objectionable, and the smell does not seem to transfer to the food. We have kept vegetables, fruits, cheeses and meat for up to two weeks and they work fine. They are a bit difficult to open. Wet fingers makes it easier.  I expect we won't use 100 in a year (the recommended shelf life). I'll update this if they start breaking down before we finish them."
5.0,Great cotume ideal for rollplay conventions or just have fun
5.0,I bought this as part of a steampunk Halloween costume. This item surprised me with its quality and craftsmanship. The clock actually worked on it. Just needed a battery. The fit was a bit snug. As the mask is pretty sturdy and stiff it doesn't have much room to play with or adjust to your face.
5.0,"this is a very high quality shirt and a clever idea, to begin with. go Sharks! burnsy is the real #1 on d for the entire nhl."
5.0,Great for camping or dancing and being your own light show!
5.0,This is Absouloutly Beautiful ! ❤
5.0,Dress arrived quickly and fits well.  Good quality for the price point.
5.0,Runs a little small. But still fit. My boyfriend loves these. Not too thick material
5.0,Used this dress for work
5.0,"Beautiful earrings! I was impressed, the shipping was fast and the package came in good conditions. The earrings came in a nice box, and are light but not cheap-looking."
5.0,Perfect feets
5.0,This has become my favorite go to dress. I'm 5 2 and wearing S.
5.0,I have a bicycle that has to sit outside right now and it was just rusting away.  This Bike Parka quality is real high and it was a little tricky to put on but it is doing a great job of protecting my bike right now.  I wish I had thought of this sooner
5.0,I really liked the design and color!! it looks so nice! I wish they had ones in gold and bronze!
5.0,They seem to be good and sturdy. There shouldn't be a problem stretching the ears with these.
5.0,very beautiful and meaningful for a reiki practioner. I ordered several to give as gifts as well. Very nicely made
5.0,"Probably shouldn't, but you need these if you think those metal welding shade 3's from bosch or those sunday driver ray bans are helping you at all. they are smaller than those other ones for $80 but have the real deal glass in them so they can get heavy on your face. if you need a good stand in for not having any shades at all. i recommend starting here. try to avoid dark colors with these."
5.0,"Super cute and trendy sunglasses for a great price. I was a little concerned about quality, but these are great."
5.0,These are great! They seem high quality and they look very pretty.
5.0,"Lovely colors - bright and cheerful. I like the way it fits me, not too tight, just the right length. It's a great bargain and makes me feel good."
5.0,"very attractive. Not too 'girly', and has the breathable back part.. and so my daughter can put her ponytail through when she sits w/ it on watching her children in their sports activity... in the heat, Chandler, AZ."
5.0,Love this wallet.  Easy to keep my cards organized and very good quality!!!
5.0,Love the shirts!!! Got as a gift for coworkers and they absolutely love it.
5.0,Fits like a glove super comfortable
5.0,Those are great. I love how thin they are they are super comfortable also and I'm so happy with this purchase!
5.0,Love it so much gonna buy more for sure. Paint with clear nail polish just in case your worried it will turn however I don’t think it will either way
5.0,Truly beautiful! It has some weight to it - it doesn't feel cheaply made. I bought two as a matched pair for a best friend gift. I can't wait give it to her.
5.0,this product was very high quality.  It holds its shape and easy to care for.
5.0,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
5.0,It is very long for my husband. A thin material with buttons in the front
5.0,Very nice the added link gave me the fit I wanted the only negative is that the prongs will pick material when it comes into contact with worth it for the &well made!
5.0,They keep me upright and moving.
5.0,Fortunately the reviews said to order bigger. I usually wear a large and ordered a 2x. Do love it
5.0,It works great and does it job well with pain.
5.0,Great item! Does the job!
5.0,"I’m using them at work, nobody noticed I have it!<br />Very comfortable"
5.0,"I fell in love with this dress right away. I bought a similar one from a different seller, but returned it because it zipped up the back and the zipper seemed really fragile. I like that you just pull this one over your head, tie the neck, and you're dressed. I plan to wear it to a wedding. I will probably dress it up with a different belt. I will update with a photo."
5.0,"Wifes loves it, looks great on her."
5.0,"I have has this for a while now, it has not tarnished at all.  Very satisfied with my purchase."
5.0,"Cheap, but good quality! Super comfortable and fit perfectly."
5.0,Love it! Much nicer quality than others I’ve ordered! Holds up to washing too (in a garment bag)!!
5.0,Dad loved it!
5.0,HOT!!!!! WILL  RECOMMEND TO ALL
5.0,"This bracelet is cute and durable.  It isn't difficult to put on nor does it take a lot of time to do so.  The pouch it comes in isn't worth mentioning... just wasted packaging material. It came in a decent amount of time and the bracelet is as described, no complaints about the company."
5.0,Gorgeous! Better than picture
5.0,Purchased the Maleficent Horns to use for Costume Day at work. Received many compliments. Worth the money. Looked great. It sealed pretty tight but did give me headaches because of it so I had to remove pretty regularly through out the day but when I did have it on it was 👌🏼
5.0,This tie fits great with my collection of $50-$75 ties. It looks great with my brown pin-striped suit and a cream colored shirt. Great value.
5.0,Such a good little backpack. I just wish the straps could be removed. I had back surgery and can’t put it on my back and it feels super bulky with the straps in the way. Has a lot of little compartments for extra things. Good bag
5.0,"Good fit , perfect size for my little one , great colors.<br />Would recommend it."
5.0,It’s soft and so comfortable
5.0,"Keep your webbing straps from flapping in the breeze.  Not sure, but I think they are ABS or HDPS plastic.  If they are anything like the others I have they are durable as all get out.  The only negative is that they are not Berry compliant."
5.0,"Ordered a larger size hoping for longer sleeves/longer hem. It's a bit shorter than I'd have liked, but still comfy. Could be a little softer - the insides of the sleeves aren't itchy bit they're not soft either. Still overall it's a decent comfy shirt."
5.0,I bought this as a gift. Its very warm.
5.0,"This coat is splendid. Exactly what I was looking for. The only thing it’s rather big and I wish I’d ordered medium. Still I’m nearly 6 ft tall so the arms are a great length. Also it comes with a silky lining which I think defeats the cozy, warm purpose. So I just cut the lining out. This way it’s fuzzy fleece inside and out. Love this coat!"
5.0,"Very cute, good quality for price"
5.0,"I love this piece, one of my favorites...... I will purchase as many colors as I can.... I want it in silver now....."
5.0,"I bought this a cute dress to wear to dinner on a cruise.  It packed great!  The shoulders fit well, so I didn't have to have any ""special"" undergarments.  It is not tight to the body.  Just a slimming shape.  The fringe gives the illusion of it being a little longer skirt, so I didn't feel like I was dressing younger than my age, but the fringe also was VERY fun!  Twirling on the dance floor was a hoot!  Highly recommend it!"
5.0,Very compforting
5.0,High quality knit and super soft. I'd wear these socks if I had miniature feet.
5.0,Was a Gift; The WWII SeaBee liked it.
5.0,I get so many compliments on these boots. The odor went away quickly and I found the size to be just right. I got them without the liner. I would highly recommend them and they arrived quickly.
5.0,It’s pretty good in size
5.0,I loved this watch. It was so pretty.<br />This watch was attractive. It had a very smooth and sleek look. It looks very nice on the wrist.<br /><br />It is very flattering. It fits well on. It is very comfortable to wear. It goes on and off easily.<br /><br />It worked without a problem. It kept good time.<br /><br />The quality is very good. This would make a very good gift for someone.<br /><br />The price is reasonable. I would recommend it.
5.0,My wife finds them to be perfect.
5.0,Receiver loved the hat.
5.0,The shipment arrived on time. The package was in perfect condition. This skirt will go with almost all of my tops and sweaters.
5.0,Love this shirt!!
5.0,Beautiful saying
5.0,so gooood! Cant believe you get 3 for the prince of 1 at the mall! They fit so well and the material is so great. They are so figure flattering
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves it.
5.0,Love these glasses for my 7 year old and 5 year old! Great quality for price.
5.0,Halloween costume and it was great!!<br />Delivery was a little early.
5.0,Never seen a bigger smile on my granddaughters face when she opened it for Christmas!
5.0,I saw the dress and thought it was fabulous!  It is completely suitable for a communion dress.  It looks angelic.<br /><br />Quality is fabulous to the point where a seamstress told me it is very well put together.
5.0,I've gotten so many compliments on my cute headbands! They stay in place well and the fabric is so soft!
5.0,Can't use. These are too big around my head.
5.0,My son is using it in his Christmas show.  So cute
5.0,Loved it when I received it it was not damaged and it was a great quality object
5.0,Beautiful pendant!  Fast Shipping!
5.0,Love these hoodie zip ups! I ordered size large. Perfect
5.0,quality & delivery were very good
5.0,"My wife loves this skirt, and she looks so hot in it!"
5.0,My cuzzin is gonna love it.
5.0,Very warm and fots my 18 mth old perfectly. Love the design
5.0,"This compress shirt is the best I never had. It holds you in, but it's not taking you our breathe which I love. Sturdy I promise I am a 52DD in the chest and it's holding theses girl's."
5.0,Worked like a charm. I didn't know it was hanging there!!
5.0,I actually bought this for my husband because the thick bands aren't as comfortable. I wore it for a day (we are the same ring size) and it felt really light and comfortable. He is a mechanic and it's been holding up really good. It's also held up really well even though he washes his hands more than 5 times a day. I would recommend this to anyone this size is perfect. It's not too thick that it makes your finger uncomfortably sweaty. It's also NOT so flimsy that it'll get caught on something or roll up and down your finger like a rubber band. It slips in and out of your finger and unlike other silicone rings it doesn't feel stiff. Because of the situation the world is in we are not wearing our regular rings we've been wearing silicone so we can take it off and wash it while we wash our hands. They dry easily and you can hit them with hand sanitizer and they hold up good!
5.0,"They feel good, they feel solid, and they look cool!!! Happy I bought them!!!"
5.0,Gave these as gifts to coworkers and was very pleased by the quality. Everyone loved them.
5.0,OMG!!! my baby loves them.  She pits them on all the time. The colors are beautiful!!!
5.0,I love these glasses and they are very good quality.
5.0,This case is awesome!  The colors are really awesome and I get tons of compliments on the camo pattern.  We just got new phones and choosing a case is always difficult.  This one is a great choice.  Nice sturdy material and covers the edges of the top screen well.  I think it will protect the phone well during drops and carrying around.  I would buy it again!
5.0,Adorably dainty.
5.0,"A great necklace that I got for my fiancee. It is quite petite, less than an inch in length, but it is very pretty and elegant. Goes well with a thin silver chain. Very light around the neck.<br /><br />Well suited to light OR dark skin."
5.0,"These bands were a direct replacement for the original Fitbit Charge 3 ones; they looked the same, they fit the same, and they fit my wrist the same."
5.0,"Very very comfy and soft jammies. Super cute too. However, the top runs large by a lot. It's very baggy. They're jammies though so I'm not too upset about that. Bottoms seem to run true to size or slightly smaller."
5.0,Love this sweater it’s a good thickness and so soft !
5.0,It's better than the picture looks. It's beautiful
5.0,My guy loved it!
5.0,"This is a very cute little bag. The colors are exactly as shown and the fabric has just a touch of sparkle. It just barely holds my Samsung Note 8 and not much more but it's not a bag I will use every day, just on occasion."
5.0,Item arrived on time and as described.  Very soft and warm and the colors is exactly as pictured. would recommend
5.0,"Beautiful earrings, my daughter loves them!! And they don't hurt her ears, she has really sensitive skin."
5.0,great fit!
5.0,love them! just the right bling!
5.0,"I bought it on lightning deal for around $20 and it was absolutely worth it. The size is great and it looks very pretty.<br /><br />However, the leather is thin and the quality of the workmanship is somewhat “low end” if you look too closely. It was a great bargain at $20. I would definitely buy again. But I would not pay full price, as the quality doesn’t come close to my other purses purchased for $80 plus."
5.0,These chains are totally worth the money. They are beautiful and well made.
5.0,"Numerous colors and diameters. It exceeded my expectations.  Love it! If you need options, buy these!"
5.0,great product does the job
5.0,Looks good. Fits fine.
5.0,Bought for trip fits perfect
5.0,Love the shoes. Attractive and comfortable.
5.0,"Arrived earlier than estimated delivery date. A nice little top, I got the XL, where I normally wear a small, or medium. I hangs on me, as shown in the photo. It fits, as I expected, but not quite as described. I'd advise to go a size, or two,, larger than you normally wear."
5.0,Very good cuality and helpful !!
5.0,This dress fit my figure perfect. I wear a 38 I for a bra size and this dress allowed me to not have to wear a bra! I was worried but it was amazing how well it fit. I ordered the 3x based on other reviews.
5.0,I have a month with the watch and I used it a full week without stopping and it worked perfectly. Then I kept it for 5 days ... it stopped after 20 hours or so. I used it again and it started without problems. I use it eventually and it works again without problems.
5.0,"It's a beautiful jacket and I wish it fit me but the size does run small. I'm normally a M/L I bought the XL the biggest size they have. it fit snug with a thin shirt on the inside, the sleeves 1/2 inch too short for my arms.  Great delivery and no problems returning"
5.0,I actually thought this was gonna be bad...But I really liked it! I'm going to use it for my Miu Iruma cosplay because why not? It's a little tight at times but that doesn't bother me I didn't see that it was a collar though so that makes it kinda weird when I wear it 0_0
5.0,"I ordered it for my friend as  a dinner dress and it looks pretty good on her. she does not have broad shoulder so the boat does not fit properly to her.  However, the quality of the dress is very nice and when wore with a golden belt it accentuates the look."
5.0,These pants make my arse look amazing. They've held up exceptionally well at the gym and in the wash.
5.0,I bought this for my daughter. She absolutely loves it! It is very pretty.
5.0,"Extremely comfortable. Adorable, washed well. Love the pockets."
5.0,FITS WELL. Order 2 sizes up. Quality material
5.0,Bought for my boyfriend who is a deputy. He wears them every night to work for the past week and hasn't had any issues! Stays in place and he is happy!
5.0,Well made and great comfort.
5.0,"I wanted something to wear under dresses that would provide me some extra security after having two children, but not be so tight and sweaty that wearing it outdoors in Texas would make me want to die. This is SO soft, breathable, comfortable, and still gives me the shaping and tucking I was hoping for. I wear an L-XL in shirts and a 10-12 dress depending on brand. I purchased an XL to make room for my back end and it's a great fit. I am 5'2, 185lbs."
5.0,"Exactly as decribed, well made and delivered quickly. I've worn it every day sice i got it. I love it!"
5.0,Excellent service. Product was just as advertised. Would definitely recommend and use this vendor again!!
5.0,Ya this glasses is turn up
5.0,"Not only does it not slip while working out, it looks great!"
5.0,Lovevthem
5.0,I liked how round they were and how reflective they are. I thought they were rose colored though. Don’t know if that’s my fault or not. Lovely glasses whichever way you look at it.
5.0,Everything was great! With this item 😊
5.0,Found nothing rong with it.added it to my keychain collection.

5.0,Very nice and a great stocking stuffer for my son. Good quality.
5.0,I loved it!!! Just as shown in pic!!!
5.0,Cute charms. They give a nice pop of color.
5.0,Adorable on!!
5.0,It's a really nice Bracelet I would recommend it and I like the pull string its way easier than a clamp and its made with real leather.
5.0,"These are really good briefs. They feel amazing, I have yet to wear them out, but I can tell they're going to be super comfortable and keep everything in order. At 5'7&#34;, the briefs go about 1/3rd of the way down my thighs.  The only gripe is the tag that's on the outside is kind of lazily done. Other than that, a wonderful underwear."
5.0,I love having all these options to choose from and I've never had a reaction problem with them!
5.0,"After searching for months for a perfectly sized bar for my industrial piercing, I stumbled upon this product. It's great quality and fits perfectly."
5.0,"Love these glasses. Unfortunately, the nose piece broke loose when I adjusted them but the sellers responded right away and are sending a new pair. Thye fit well, are comfortable, look good and are visually very clear without distortion."
5.0,"Love this set, got so many compliments and green color is so beautiful"
5.0,Very nice ring.  Very good service.
5.0,If your jogging or bicycling this shirt should be easily seen.  I almost had to put on sunglasses when I saw this shirt.
5.0,"Super cute studs. They're small, but perfect for her! My daughter loves them!"
5.0,My girlfriend absolutely loved the necklace.
5.0,"It's all about the color and style of this item and I love it. Nice large size yet not to big, chain strap is nice touch - overall great price for a great item. It arrived in a timely manner and packaged well. I haven't worn it yet but I'm sure it will be just the pop of style I need!"
5.0,"These PJs were purchased as birthday gift. They were well received. In fact, they were a hit. The birthday girl loves them and favors them above all of the other gifts she received."
5.0,"I loved that this product was as described, fits perfectly, colors look great, easy to install. I love the black buckle on the red band, it looks perfect."
5.0,Love these earrings! I bought them to go with the heart bracelet
5.0,The cut is not too snug but smart. I love the fit. I wish it came with shorts to wear underneath - just in case I bend too low. In summary I look like a golf pro in this dress!
5.0,"Nice quality, thick gloves, easy to use"
5.0,So cute matching with my granddaughter.
5.0,"Nicely made, and very flatting fit. Will be cute to wear paddle boarding"
5.0,If you are a cheese head you will love this version period
5.0,These leggings are true to size and fit perfectly. I love that they are not see through when i bend.
5.0,"I purchased this to use on my relatively new looking silver necklace, intending it to be more of a future-proofing purchase. But after giving it a test run, wound up giving my necklace such a good shine. Very happy I got one so early on."
5.0,Love them!! Sole is great combination of firm and squishy and firm well to my feet.  I have planters faciatius and these are excellent for wearing around the house and a trip to the store
5.0,"I think this dress is really cute. I wear a size 12 and got a large, I probably could have gotten away with a Medium but I am still happy with it. I get tons of compliments. I have washed it twice and didn’t experience any raveling or tearing of the trim that I saw mentioned in other reviews."
5.0,Awesome product!
5.0,"Absolutely love this product! I have bought two of them. They fit very nice, they don’t move around much, they’re thin so they don’t make my head sweat. Really love this product, don’t have any cons, I highly recommend!! 😊😊"
5.0,Very comfortable; fun and flirty
5.0,These baby crocs are adorable and such good quality!!They have a Velcro strap across the top that secure the shoe very well.I had to return them because they were too small for my daughter but I already ordered them again in a larger size since I loved them so much!I would highly recommend these sandals
5.0,Bought these boots for my 4 year old niece. She LOVES them. The Pictures don't do them justice. They're adorable!
5.0,Beautiful dress.  Nicely made.  Material is soft but durable.  True. To size.
5.0,Looks just like picture.
5.0,"Very pleased with this purchase. The winter is almost over and my 2-year old girl wanted to play around with the snow.  While i couldn't see any information whether this was waterproof/resistent, we gave it run. The exterior did get soaked as the snow melted on her boots, but the interior was dry and i checked that her feet were warm after about an hour of just playing around 3 inches of snow depth.  Just have to be careful not to let the snow in from her legs/pants. these are super small boots and the snow would likely be higher than the boots."
5.0,I really like this set.  Very nicr
5.0,"Beautiful,  delicate, hand wash and air dry for sure. Crocheted. Sits at hip length. Comfortable. So definitely do want to shrink or will be crop top 😂"
5.0,"JIALEX replacement band changed the look of my apple watch 42mm silver aluminum completely! I can wear it for more classy occasions. I have a small wrist, so I had to remove some links and the tool provided is easy to adjust the length. So far I have 3 bands for my Apple Watch and this one is my new favorite.  I really love the brushed stainless steel, it looks professional and not too heavy."
5.0,Love love love this onesie<br />Bought for my bird obsessed daughter<br />An unbelievable price for an awesome quality piece and shipping what fast as well
5.0,"People complement me on this pretty, yet cheap feminine watch  flowers and such"
5.0,This product it’s very good
5.0,breathable and comfortable.
5.0,"Great quality for the price.  Overall feel of the product is great.  Also included are two covers, cleaning cloths, and even a small screwdriver on a keychain to retighten screws when necessary (this was probably cooler than the sunglasses themselves)."
5.0,Beautiful watch works fine great big and tall men
5.0,Great watch for all day and evening.
5.0,"I teach tennis and I wanted a thin, light weight watch to keep track of the time during an hour-long lesson.  This is the perfect answer to my problem.  I don't even know it is there on my wrist.  And only ten bucks!!"
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for. It is Stirling silver and delicate
5.0,He liked it and wants more.
5.0,"Very cute, nice quality romper. Just too big. Maybe runs a little large."

5.0,"My wife really loves these sunglasses. For the price, they are decent optics and have proven to be well built and durable."
5.0,I have several pairs of these and they are wonderful.  My plantar fascistic is better as long as I use these inserts in all of my footwear. Recommended!
5.0,Bought this for my daughter
5.0,A lot better than I expected and fits just like a hockey jersey would. Love it.
5.0,"I absolutely love these pants! They are so comfortable and they fit perfectly. I love the fun patchwork style that they come in, perfect to add a bit of funk to any outfit! Definitely will buy again!"

5.0,So super cute and made with quality materials.
5.0,"Nice service, nice packaging, very nice sterling silver and turquoise work."
5.0,The dress looks great and feels great.
5.0,My boy loves that type of swim bottom. According to other reviewers I ordered a size smaller since It supposed to fit tight.. had to exchange for a bigger size - so it’s really true to size.
5.0,Great quality strap. I'm really pleased with this product.
5.0,I liked most that it came in different lengths and that as all jeans do when you put them on at first they are tight but as the day goes they loosen up to the perfect fit.  So thankful I found them and they didn't cost an arm and a leg and I could get them in other colors not just blue jean blue.
5.0,This item fit perfectly.
5.0,Received the necklace within a week and surprised at the quality of the piece.  It layed downwell due to it's weight.  I could not have been happier.
5.0,absolutely IN LOVEEEE it’s beautiful a bit itchy but that’s just the type of material but fits amazing. I ordered a 10 and it fits perfectly. Lacing up on your own is difficult but doable. Definitely worth the purchase
5.0,Great item … great price
5.0,"Great for keeping my college ring in place, especially in the winter. Easy application and removal!"
5.0,Bought these for my 11 year old son and he loves it! Thank God we did not get the pink colored socks like the other customer.
5.0,Zipper broke after 4th day of wearing. Difficult to put on. Lining catches up on top of back and has to be pulled down by someone else. Would not buy again.
5.0,Very nice keychain.  Use it for a couple of weeks already
5.0,Gift holder is happy
5.0,"It's a perfect fit for my hands, so their measuring and sizing charts work well (at least for L size). Beware you cannot use your phone while having these on, but that didn't bother me."
5.0,"My daughter really likes these, they haven’t worn at all and she has no issues sleeping with them in"
5.0,I love thos blouse.  The mayerial os wonderful. It does rin. Very large so I will return for a smaller size
5.0,"These sunglasses are so cute and stylish.  I got three compliments on these glasses at the town festival the other day.  The sun was out and glaring like crazy.  These glasses stopped the glare and really helped save my eyes from the glare.  The glasses I got are the light pink framed ones with the rainbow lenses.  The rainbow lenses are so clear and create just the right amount of protection from the sun's glare.  Not too dark and not too light, just right.  The lenses are tinted enough to work effectively but do not inhibit seeing everything clearly.  No blur, just clear vision so you can see what is going on while protecting your eyes.<br /><br />Did I say stylish?  These glasses look just like the expensive designer glasses.  The quality and fit on these glasses also matches the designer sunglasses.  Very nice, comfortable fit.  In fact, these glasses fit so well, it is like you have no glasses on.  I am very pleased with the quality, fit and vision that I am getting with these glasses.  All while looking stylish.<br /><br />Nice product and the glasses came with a cleaning cloth, blue plastic eyeglasses case and a soft cloth bag to store the glasses in.  These freebies were a nice touch and made me think the maker was proud of their product.  I know I am proud to wear these glasses and will get many years of use out of them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

5.0,Really good quality.  And it arrived much sooner than I expected.  I would recommend.
5.0,Perfect necklace and in a lovely gift box
5.0,"I've collected montegrappa fountain pens over the years, never knew about their watches.  This timepiece has good weight to it, runs smoothly and for the price, it's a steal. I'm going to purchase another one while available at this price point."
5.0,I absolutely love these earrings. They stay in place for the most part and are so adorable.  I found they are quite comfortable to wear.
5.0,Love this dress! Super cute and so comfortable!
5.0,I am large-chested so this was a bit snug on top but this dress is BEAUTIFUL and well-made.  The larger top size was too long and didn't have enough time to have it hemmed.  I received so many compliments on this gown.  Excellent choice for a formal occasion.
5.0,"Love, love these boots! They are so comfortable and have a great look! The color and trim is nice too :)"
5.0,"Very comfortable, fits perfect on me. Im 5'11 and 175 pounts and I bought and XL, it goes right on my knees."
5.0,Soft and loved the color
5.0,I'm so glad I got this love it and fits very nice and surprise love the pockets .I'm gonna order another right now ..
5.0,"Item as described, seems well made."
5.0,Just what I needed. It is sized correctly and very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"I love this dress! The material is nice and sturdy and the length is perfect for work. The belt is a nice touch, but I'm sure I'll be mixing it up with the other belts in my wardrobe. The fit is very flattering. When I tried it on, it did stick to my legs a little, but I expect that with this material having been in plastic while in storage. Just need to rub it down with a few dryer sheets and I am confident it will be as good as gold."
5.0,Ok for the cost and my son loves his.
5.0,My granddaughter was so thrilled!
5.0,Like the material perfect!
5.0,"I've been using this for about a month now. Bought this for my Nook HD. When it arrived it did have some smell to it, but it went away after about 1 day. It fits the Nook secure and snug from all sides. Your Nook will not fall or slip out. It looks nice, and has a nice feel. Not too bulky, I can still hold it in one hand to read. All buttons and ports are accessible, including the speakers on the back. It also has a pen/stylus loop on the back, which I placed nicely so it's not ever in the way. The cover closes magnetically and works with the Nooks Auto On/Off feature. The cover stays in place well with just the magnets keeping it closed, but it also has an elastic strap to make sure it stays closed. The inside pocket does not hold very much a few business cards, and a passport. If you don't stuff the pocket, upon closing the cover the Nook's screen is protected from anything rubbing on it. You can stand it horizontally or vertically, but you can't change the angle. This works fine, but it's not really a feature I need. I am very pleased with this purchase, and would by again. Hard to beat for the price too!"
5.0,"Love the rectangular lenses.  Also, the lenses are not super dark, more of an amber, which I think is very stylish.  I get compliments on these sunglasses every day."
5.0,Shipping was very fast. Material is soft and my son loves his hoodie.
5.0,"I didn’t have high expectations for these boots. They’re inexpensive but they looked so different that I just had to give them a try. I have a hard time finding shoes because I have short fat feet and my toes spread when I walk so space in the toe box is very important.<br />I just unboxed these. They arrived 2-day prime shipping and although they came with other items, the boots themselves came in a plastic bag. Inside the bag, however, was both boots, each within their own shoe bags, which I thought was nice. Having worked at a high-end leather shoe store in the past, I can say that I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the leather on these and a much more expensive pair. The soles, however, are casual rubber soles, but that fits the style of the boot. I put on the right one and was shocked to find that it fit the bigger of my duck feet. I put them both on and did a runway walk through the house and can say that they’re definitely a keeper. The laces are purely ornamental. There is a zippered closure and the footbed is rather well cushioned. I was hoping for the top of the boot to fit more snugly around my ankle but I don’t mind the wider opening. These are great casual boots (I ordered the red) considering the price!"
5.0,"Muy bueno , está muy bonito , tal y como se ve en la foto"
5.0,"Exceeded my expectations, beautiful dress and fit perfectly."
5.0,She liked it and so do I. Great little extra side gift.
5.0,It's plain in the front but really stands out with the back of the shirt. It looks amazing paired with the Queenie Ke Womens Yoga Sport Bra Light Support Strappy Free To Be Bra!
5.0,"Absolutely perfect, great value for your money.  Bought it for a very special friend who is not really into jewelry, he loved it."
5.0,"Excellent quality hat and large patch with correct looking ship. Highly recommend it for those who served on the ship, or, like me support the Navy and like to collect different ship hats. Will DEFINITELY use seller again for further hats."
5.0,great item - as described
5.0,So adorable bought them for my boyfriend for christmas!
5.0,Love them keep me warm when it was zone below outside
5.0,"The cloth is just the right weight, not thin, not too thick. The fit is generous. The color has held up through repeated washings. I love it."
5.0,My cousin had me to order it for her husband and he like it. I would buy this for me if it's available to buy.
5.0,I was a bit nervous ordering this but I’m so glad I did. I’ve been having bad luck with finding clothes that look good and actually fit. This one was just perfect. True to size and super cute. Has a good amount of stretch to the fabric and the straps are adjustable. Goes great with a t shirt or long sleeve under it as well. Definitely gonna buy different ones.
5.0,the best ever
5.0,Usually wear a size 7 so I purchased 2X and they were extremely small. Order 2 sizes up for a reg fit. Material is nice and comfortable feeling.
5.0,"Beautiful color, well sewn, nice fabric and fit as expected."

5.0,Another great deal with the Casio F91W-1. Good knock around watch.
5.0,"I love this sheer wrap because of its lightness, shade, and formalness. The wrap is a one-size fits all; I'm a 1X/2X with an E chest, and it fits and I like how it falls (there's enough material to bring it together with a brooch if I so choose). However, I feel like I'm on the edge of the OS. I don't think it would be suitable for some 2Xs (like 2X/3X individuals) OR anyone beyond a 2X OR with anyone with a large chest. So, beyond the OS &#34;size,&#34; it's completely sheer, with faux lace and a faux fur collar. I was really worried about the collar (thinking that I wouldn't want to wear it because of that), but I actually really like it because it makes the wrap more versatile. It's sheer enough to wear inside in the summer AND the faux fur color also makes it a great wrap for the fall and winter months (a night at the ballet/theatre/opera).<br /><br />The wrap is definitely more on the formal/dressy side. I believe it could be worn more regularly in a professional office setting, but it's going to be best for nights out where you need something a bit more formal than your basic black dress shirt + skirt/pants but not so formal that you need a dress. I really like the shades of black, pairing black on black can be difficult because of the varying shades of black, but this is actually a richer/deeper shade that I feel comfortable pairing with a black shirt."
5.0,This was a present for a friend and was well-received and greatly appreciated. She had been looking for one like this. Very happy!
5.0,"I LOVE CROCS!!!! Crocs are my favorite shoes. They are very comfortable and they fit me perfectly. I wish I could have more of their shoes. I love, love, love crocs!!!!!"

5.0,"Love the 34&#34; length, bright colors, comfy knit fabric, and price!"
5.0,"I bought it as a gift and its simplycity and focus on the details makes it really cute, personally i do like this kind of gifts where things appear to be simple but you have to look close to appreciate the details. Thats why i am happy to give this one as a gift for my special one."
5.0,"Most sweaters I have to wear a small but not this one. I had to buy a medium because the sleeves were a little tight. Besides that, it is a really nice sweater."
5.0,Because of foot issues I have started wearing vionic shoes. I liked the price on these so I thought I would try them. Got several compliments and was able to wear them for about 4 hours the first time. The heel was also a good size. I wore mine with jeans.
5.0,Love these shoes. I wear them for work and they go with almost everything.
5.0,Nothing to dislike. Love these beads for any occasion.
5.0,"I’m going to buy other one, thanks"
5.0,"I needed a slim ring to use to hold a larger ring in place until I could get the other ring re-sized.  The size 6, 925 ring was perfect, very dainty (which is what I wanted, subtle)  but isn't bendy or anything.  Also comfortable, no sharp edges, have had for about a month now and very happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"Looks nice on, i liked it"
5.0,"I got this for family photos as it tied in the colors— colors are true to the photo (blue, yellow, gray), it fit well, it’s well made, affordable and the shipping was very fast (I gambled on non-prime to get the colors I wanted and it payed off). Highly recommend this cardigan sweater. Thank you to the seller! Well done."
5.0,The bands are cute and comfy.
5.0,Cheap and functional!  Great quality.
5.0,I am small (36A at best) and the medium fit great. Super comfortable and affordable.
5.0,"I'm 5'6/ 150 pounds/ 30 inch waist/ 30 inseam. I have strong legs from squats and running. I have to say the legging part is a little baggy and long . I went with mediums. This is because smalls are usually too tight around the quads and butt area.  I would say go with the smalls on this product. The shorts are great for me, but the legs are gonna need two or three dryer runs. They are good quality."
5.0,"This top looks like the pictures provided on Amazon. The material is soft, it is lightweight, and cute."

I needed a dragon specifically for a gift, and Soufeel had the cutest one, so I ordered it.  Very happy to say that the bead is just as beautiful and smooth and perfect as in the pictures.  Now I am going to find a Soufeel bead for another gift!  In short, the bead is high quality, excellent detail and smooth finishing.

Great buy!! I should add, I've got size 7, super wide feet, so it's hard for me to find boots that I can fit my foot into without a zipper or laces... and I'm able to wear these with socks even... no problem! Size is perfect."

I absolutely love this dress!!"
5.0,"I finally found perfect knee highs!  Nice weight,not to thin and not to thick.<br />These stay up all day and the top elastic is comfortable.  I purchased 3 pairs and will buy more."
5.0,"I have now bought 3 of these dresses and have another on the way I'm 38DDD and love how this fits. If you are very flat you may not be happy with how baggy it is on top but I finally found a dress appropriate for teaching in and it has pockets! The solid fabric has a nice velvety feel though the print one I got didn't seem to be of the same fabric. In 5'6"" and they seem to be the perfect length for me for teaching cause I can wear bike shorts under it which is good for being on the rug with kids. And I can wear most shareware with it. I have suggested this dress to many people and my coworkers have loved it so much a few bought them as well. Great for on the go any easy to accessories."

5.0,"It's really hard to beat these shades for the price.<br />You also get a screwdriver, cleaning cloth, and carrying pouch.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to suggest these to anyone looking for some nice glasses and don't want to worry about losing the, because of the price and so on.<br />Thanks, Linvo. Nice job"

I also posted it to my personal Facebook page and sent links to my friends in  the military (they're always sore) Your product (and your company) work miracles! Since my heart attack my legs were always in a lot of pain. Since wearing your socks I have no pain at all! Ive bought 4 pair and I'm going to buy 3 more pair so I have one pair for each day of the week so I don't have to wash them nightly lol. Again, thank you so much!! I hope my recommendations to my groups increase your sales! You have a fantastic company!"
5.0,My sons has enjoyed wearing boxer-type underwear simce about five years old. Three years later and he really likes these. Fit and comfort have been great for him.
5.0,Love this. At first it takes some time to get used to the material but it fit well. I usually fit a medium/lrg but ordered a large. Danced in it and it stretched and was great. Is exactly like the picture will order from them again.
5.0,I wanted to try this style since they are so famous and it became my favorite so I started wearing every day. Polarized sunglasses come at a very high price if you want quality but the UV 400 on these work perfect for me for everyday use. They are very lightweight and durable for everyday wear.
5.0,Usually when I purchase cardigans I like them to cover the back end as well. But other than that its good quality and soft just going to sew on pockets to hold light change and chapstick.
5.0,My wife Love this dress.we were invited new years party.Believe me she got lots of good compliment .love the color and metirial.
5.0,Very light weight & I have received many compliments on them!
5.0,"I love this watch,for the price it is great...."
5.0,My dad is 87 and the doctor told him to wear compression socks.  He really likes these he says these are very comfortable and these are easy for him to put on by himself.
5.0,This is the cutest outerwear for baby. My baby is 15 mnths old and it looks like she wont fit in it in a month. But so far it has been life savior. It is warm. It is cute. And weve had lots of compliments on the babys look
5.0,I love it and get sooo many compliments
5.0,"Fits good. Looks good. No complaints<br /><br />2 month update, letters starting to break and rip on front of sweatshirt. Has only been washed 2 or 3 times"

5.0,Fit great  to cute soft  no color fade  bought the black pair too  no ridingup  and covered my cheeks
5.0,Stays attached worth the money.
5.0,"Love it, washes well..."
5.0,"I've gone through a lot of wood gauges/plugs, (I'm at 00) and most are way too dark or no visible grain. They tend to look just matte black. I bought these and another light wood and they both arrive looking very light to were I was bummed. Though after washing them, these ones darkened up to a solid brown with visible grain."
5.0,"This is a very delicate looking bracelet, easy to put on because it's stretchy. It would look nice with other bracelets and I love the color of pink."
5.0,I like the way they sparkle and shine.
5.0,"I've been using one of these for about 6 months and they are great -- although I don't need it yet, I bought a second one as a backup."
5.0,Had to buy another because i lost one but they have been my favorite earrings to wear love them.
5.0,I mean for $6 they accomplish its mission of holding my sleeves up. Solid elastic pieces that won’t be loose after few uses.
5.0,I just love the bling so sparkly and always get compliments.this the way I go in style!
5.0,I absolutely love these shoes!! Very comfortable and super cute!
5.0,Great looking sunglasses!
5.0,I LOVE MY NEW SOCKS!
5.0,Sooo cute and great quality!
5.0,My husband was very happy with this.
5.0,I am using this as a prop for my Halloween yard decorations.  It’s perfect and came quickly!  If I were to wear it it would fit a little loose but I’d rather it be loose then too tight.  Love this little dickens! 😉
5.0,Makes it orgasmic
5.0,Awesome looking necklace I get compliments on it all the time. Very well-made.
5.0,"I purchased this for my nephew who recently enlisted in the Navy. No idea where it will take him, just wanting some assist in keeping him safe. GI approved and elegant."
5.0,Posture shirt with front zip for people with shoulder issues is great! I stand all day and work up patients at an eye doctor's office. This helps with muscle memory and reminding me to keep my shoulder back. Well worth the investment.
5.0,We love these glasses we bought for our son!  He can pick which color he wants for the day and then we still have 3 other pairs.  I did end up giving my niece the animal print one just because they looked a little bit more girly.  I ordered the size 4-7 because my 3 year old has a pretty big head but these fit perfectly!  I would recommend going up a size just because they will fit a little better and they will also last them longer!  Its awesome that they come in a 4 pack for a pretty cheap price because kids don't always keep them in a place where you can find them and you still have 3 back ups!  I would purchase them again!  They are very durable as well!  I did receive these sunglasses at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0,Was pretty surprised how nice this fabric feels. Was expecting dollar store laundry bag quality but by budget was small so I gave them a try and I am very happy. My kids use them to take their snow gear to school and back home in when its wet. They are younger elementary and its perfect.
5.0,I was surprised that these sunglasses were well made for the price you pay.  I would love to get all the colors!
5.0,Bought this for my daughter when we went on our vacation and got lots of compliments
5.0,"This handbag is beautiful. I have not worn it yet as to attest to the durability of the bag. However, I am looking forward to wearing it."
5.0,My husband loves it. It hangs secure around his face but not overly tight.
5.0,This watch band gets everyone's attention!  They all want to know where I got it from and I tell them &#34;Amazon&#34;!  It's beautiful and classy!
5.0,I never wear hats and don't think I look good in baseball caps.  The size fits my bigger than average head well and I like the style.  I wanted something to wear for my vacation to Mexico this fall.
5.0,"I like the bracelet, it look really nice on my personal opinion. I work in a retail store and I get people asking all they time where I got the bracelet from, If you planning on buying this bracelet you should measure your wrist because It could fit tight, like in my case since I spent a great amount of time lifting weights."
5.0,Nice and good quality. My kid really love it!
5.0,"So fun!  I had a large 3rd grader & an average 4th grader wear this at our Christmas concert for ""Frosty.""  It was hilarious & so cute!"
5.0,"Love the product! Actually very slouchy, nice stretch. Detachable furry ball makes it nice to either wash it or to wear a slouchy hat with no puff or with puff. One of my fav hats to date! Very very cute"
5.0,Need more colors and styles if you expect them to be used for working out.  This would be a huge step forward and an increase in your sales.
5.0,"Great Product..I am on blood thinner, I wear this to prevent bruising. IT WOKS GREAT!"
5.0,"Comfortable, soft, flattering... I need more colors."
5.0,Just perfect!
5.0,It was a little big but I understand that it's one size fits all. It's hard to find a cotton cover up so I'm thrilled! I ordered another one!
5.0,"I love my Diamond Heart Pendant, and so glad I made the choice to buy it for myself. It's very pretty and comfortable to wear. :o)"
5.0,"Perfect for Shark Week and wearing while running errands. The red color is nice. The iron on decal is nice, too. I usually order a small because I'm short, but I was concerned after looking at their size chart. I usually wear a size 4, so according to their chart, I should go with a medium, so that's what I ordered. Fits like a normal small like my other t-shirts."
5.0,Great quality earring back. Locks in place very securely so that earring will not fall out but not too difficult to remove when ready to take out earring.
5.0,"Great material, super soft & warm"
5.0,I like the shirt. It’s comfortable and falls where I wanted it to.
5.0,Great for the range!!
5.0,"I really like my mask. It keeps me warm, sometimes too warm. I have another, one piece, that the bottom of the face hole would creep up into my eyes. This one does not do that. Very comfortable. With this on you can choose not to have your face covered and just have your head, ears, and neck warm. If I lost this one, I'd order another."
5.0,Absolutely Gorgeous. It was a gift which was loved by the recipient.
5.0,This charm describes my daughter when she has to meet with opposition and negativity. She loved it as it reminded her of her own independence and healthy self-esteem!
5.0,Pods made with tuff plastic very good quality.
5.0,Holds up to Texas rain/wind and an elementary kid. What more is there to say?
5.0,"Wow I was pleasantly surprised by these earrings. The picture was very nice but when I opened them…..wow they were even prettier and slightly bigger and rounder in real life!!<br /><br />They look quite dainty in the picture, but I would say the Pearl in these earrings isn’t the size of a tiny pea,  but rather the size of a small blueberry!! Sooo it’s perfect, not too tiny not huge ! Perfect! Finally a pleasant surprise when opening my packages ha<br />My only but…of course everyone had one….is I wanted them to look a little more asymmetrical and a little more irregular these appear in the bag to be identical and both perfectly round….oh well still very very happy!  Get these you won’t be sorry"
5.0,"I was quite skeptical ordering something that's Asia XL (which is US Medium). When it arrived and I tried on, it fit on perfectly at my size (medium). Just read the US standardization that is written next to the Asia sizing. You won't be disappointed at all getting this nice polo!"
5.0,I used this for my Amazon Echo and it works.
5.0,"These were so cool that I didn’t want to wear them. They look like a collectors item, they feel like a collectors item. They’re unique and caught the attention of all my friends. I loved this one so much that I bought the Patrick one’s and now i’m Just waiting for them to be delivered. The shoes laces take a little getting used to but once you do they don’t seem very different. They fit comfortably after you wear them for a day or two they might be a little stiff when you first put them on but they relax onto your foot."
5.0,"Lots of stretch which for me, is perfect. Fabric isn't quite what I was expecting, I was expecting something a bit heavier and I feel ironing will definitely be in order whenever I go to wear it. Buttons on the waist are adorable, I feel like it looks a bit dead without a crinoline but we will see once I take an iron to it. Overall, I was very pleased!"
5.0,Amazing quality and very well made with quality materials. It was an awesome gift!
5.0,Very comfortable. Love the colors . Fits perfect.

5.0,"Great value for money and my brother loved it as his backyard DIY prom! It isnt flimsy and to be honest we took a guess with the size we got a 2xl, was a little big but looked great either way! We"
5.0,"I was skeptical about the size, I ordered a size bigger than US size. It's similar to Europe size for me. Fits great. It has no chest pad, but it's snug enough. Or can be worn with a bikini. I haven't washed it yet, so not sure how it will hold up. But assuming if I wash it in cold water and hang dry, it should be fine."
5.0,Love these. I'm always looking for fun earrings to wear to work and these are so cute and everyone comments on them
5.0,"Good, universal skirt. Maneuverable and fitting. Perfect for practices."
5.0,I got these pants for work and I absolutely love them! So cute and comfy.

5.0,my 8 year old loves it and it fits perfectly.
5.0,"I ordered a Small and it fits.  I am 5 ft tall, 130 lbs, and wear a 36D.  That being said, it's a bit tight at the tight, but not too tight.  Love the flair of this dress and how it will easily transition into fall with boots and a cardigan."
5.0,The workmanship is excellent. This is a beautiful ring
5.0,"this watch looks very elegant.I feel I can wear it, dressed up, or with sweats.good product, even my husband was impressed, (he is a ""rolex"" guy). I am happy. sincerely KHM,LB,CA."

5.0,Came quickly at a bargain
5.0,"I have ordered these a few more times. I love the fit! I use these hiking in the fall, winter, and spring in Ohio."
5.0,"Looks wonderfully boho. And the price is unbeatable. And the way the chains are weigh on your forehead, the headpiece doesn't move or get crooked. Even while I was at a concert dancing it stayed intact."
5.0,"Very nice when you want some bling. It lasted for about a year wearing 24/7 then some rhinestones started coming loose. For the price, I just bought another.  Great deal!!"
5.0,Love the fit and quality
5.0,"Very good quality, my trio loves it."
5.0,"I love this suit! It's very flattering and fits as expected. If you're a fan of the other Esther Williams swimsuits, you'll love this one too. Normally I like suits with ruching on the sides to hide my stomach, but it's just not necessary with this one. The price is expensive, but the suit is well-made and well worth it!"
5.0,Me gusto mucho quedan muy bien
5.0,"I bought these for myself and for my fiancé, they are great socks, keep your toes warm and super comfortable. Hat is just as good!"

5.0,My daughter like the design and the colors.
5.0,I like these pants they are very comfortable
5.0,Nose piercing.
5.0,"Once I found the right size, this turned out to be a nice top.  I originally ordered this in the green color, but actually I would call it more of a turquoise, in a size medium as was recommended by Amazon.  When I tried it on I found it to be pretty baggy, so I ordered it again in a size small.  Much better!  For reference, I’m 5’ 7”, 122 lbs., 39” bust measurement.  Returned the medium and am keeping the small."
5.0,"I was very skeptical and worried that these would suck since they are described as Grey and not polarized, but they are FANTASTIC.  My 2009 Oakley's now look brand new and the lenses are just as dark and efficient as the original ones.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
5.0,Love this dress! This is my second purchase of this style of dress in a different pattern - love the feel and lightness of it. Can easily be for a semi-formal or casual wear.

5.0,Perfect for 8year old
5.0,"This is a super comfy shirt that's made out of the kind of material you find in thermal wear. I'm sure it's going to make a great addition to my fall/winter wardrobe! The mauve coloring is especially subtle and neutral, so it can easily pair up with most of my clothing. It looks fantastic with leggings and tall boots, too!"

5.0,This is adorable. I love this top!

They wad up small so they can be smashed into a larger bag to carry into the store, they hold so much stuff, and they can be washed if they get dirty! I love these bags and will be so sad if they ever stop making them!"
5.0,Looks like picture

5.0,"I wore this dress for NYE with some beautiful heels and received so many compliments. The color is so unique and stunning, really stands out. The fit of this dress is flattering and comfortable. It hides anything necessary while showing off the right curves. Pricey but so worth it. I've since bought this dress in navy, and also the shorter version too."
5.0,"L❤ve, l❤ve Ultimate Collection, bling & especially this necklace. Iv'e order it so many times. Hope they create a pink and purple bling one. Make sure to coat this one because it will turn !"

5.0,Cute love yummy bee costumes
5.0,"Great belt. Good for spanking, too!!!"
5.0,"Wow, I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. The material is thick, it fits wonderfully. The skirt will need ironing but has nice pleats. It's a high waist design.I'm 5'6&#34;, 37&#34; bust, 26&#34; waist, 40&#34; hip."
5.0,One of my favorite fashion belts
5.0,My daughter loves it and it fit well but is not thick

5.0,Good heavyweight product
5.0,Good looking and functional
5.0,"This is the second one I have purchased.  I have received compliments from others on this watch.  I would be a little happier if the battery lasted a little longer, but then I use the stopwatch more than most.  I have had this one with the bright blue numbers and watch hands and the one that doesn't and this one is easier to see.  You can't go wrong for the price."
5.0,I've ordered several replacement bands for my fitbit; the others were the silicone and worked fine.  I was hesitant in ordering the leather but was pleased with the quality and look of it.  The metal clasp give it an elegant flair.
5.0,Vino antes de la fecha.
5.0,Bought these for my daughter and they are cute and she said they are the most comfortable bra she has!
5.0,"Tie/square sets arrived on time. They were nicely packaged. Best of all, they look great!"
5.0,I like the comfort of these masks as it makes breathing easier. The filter provides protection. The only glitch I have found is that they are not acceptable at some hospitals because of the vent.
5.0,Perfect for my bridesmaids!
5.0,These are my favorite socks!  I was just about to buy a 3rd pack when I saw they were gone.  Bring them back!
5.0,Super soft and stretchy.  Comfortable and I get loads of compliments.
5.0,Nice and cute. Gave as gift.
5.0,Fits perfectly! Love this outfit!
5.0,"This top is super cute! High quality fabric, definitely feels like it’ll last a long time, not cheap and thin like some tank tops I’ve ordered. It’s ideal for yoga as it doesn’t slip and show my bra , even during difficult postures and after I get sweaty. Love it!"
5.0,MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
5.0,"really good pair, i just wish the price didnt double cause it was only about 14-15 when i bought it"
5.0,"This was what I was looking for outside the typical bike jerseys. I'd call it a fitted size, though if that's what you want."
5.0,She was very popular in the mosh pit.... whatever that is.
5.0,"One of the ears was floppy lol but overall great hoodie for a quick costume for Disneyworld when paired up with hairy leggings :P  I wear a large and got the XL as noted in the description and other reviews, and fit perfectly."
5.0,"This is beautiful! However is very sheer, see thru. You must wear a slip underneath. It is very long. I cut off 2 ruffles and it still hits the floor. I am 5'2"" tall & weight 130 pounds.  It is white, but not a bright white. I bought an XL because others said it runs small & it does.  It probably is more of American medium size. Worth the 20 bucks."
5.0,Great colors! I've been wearing them for a couple of weeks now. I have small wrists and the band is larger than my original but so far that hasn't been an issue. The no slip ring keeps the extra band out of the way. The material is less flexible but again no issues or complaints.
5.0,Nice nail drill. Been using it over a year and still going strong.
5.0,"Perfect fit,good quality at a great price"
5.0,Had to give it away~ too small for me
5.0,The effiel tower design looks great.  Plenty of room.
5.0,"Literally my favorite tanks for the gym. Super light weight, comfy, and fit perfect. I have 9 and are they are great. I am 6’2” 190lbs and large fits the best."
5.0,Great gift for an Alpha.
5.0,This shawl covers the shoulders well and does not slip. Very comfortable to wear.
5.0,"I love it, my phone and my ID and lipgloss can fit with no problem. It’s really soft"
5.0,It is straight forward product. Take the time to size it with the toolkit it comes with so it fits a snug or loose as you want it.<br /><br />Down side is takes a little bit of time to size it right. That isn't much of a complaint but for those that don't want to give them time to do it.
5.0,Awesome costume.  One of the buttons needs a little sewing on action but otherwise a very authentic costume.
5.0,I washed item and washed very well and did not fade!!
5.0,"I wanted a rubber strap for my big Seiko NeoClassic Quartz watch. It came with a good-looking brown leather strap but I don't like leather in the summer. This is rubber but resembles leather. If it gets sweaty I can just wash it off. This strap is a bit thick but comfortable. It seems sturdy and looks really good, all for about ten dollars."
5.0,Love love love the band on the inside to keep them from slipping up. I’m a hygienist and wear one daily along with loupes and light. Buttons on back are perfect for mask and inside band keeps cap from slipping when I have to remove loupes and switch to my regular glasses. I have really long hair (3-4 inches past shoulders) and can fit all of it in a bun and under the cap comfortably.<br />The other girls in my office are always asking to borrow one of mine! Designs are so cute and patients comment often. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,"Very cute dress, and has pockets! Fit perfect. Love it."
5.0,"I really wasn't sure if this would fit right and comfortably, but I have to say I was really happy with this purchase. Super cute, comfy, and good quality for the price! Bought another one for my little sister!"

5.0,For our son who plays  golf will like it
5.0,Pleasantly surprised with how cozy and soft these slipper socks were.  Also purchased for my 95 year old Mom.  She liked them too!
5.0,"Dress is super cute. Good quality. Its thick stretchy material it does not look tacky. I ordered a medium it fit perfect. Im 5' 130 lbs, 34C. The color is a muted smokey blush. Color is better than in picture for my taste. Wish there were more colors"
5.0,Super comfy. I bought two! They're well made and the design is true to what was advertised. I'd buy more socks!
5.0,"I bought these for Christmas for my mentally challenged cousin.  He's the kind of kid who loses everything.  But now it's September and he still has them.  That's how much he likes the gloves.<br /><br />As for the glove itself, they don't seem to be for warmth, although they are capable of making hands marginally warmer.  These seem like they are better football gloves for when you're playing outside to get a better grip on the ball.  Worth the money."
5.0,"Perfect dress! Wish I could buy more colors. Material is thick but stretches, smooths imperfect areas. I am 5ft 145lbs and very busty and the medium is perfect!"
5.0,Works amazing for my daughters dance classes!
5.0,Fit perfect to size very comfortable ordering another pair
5.0,"I purchased this swim shirt to wear snorkeling in the Caribbean and it was perfect!  I got so many compliments on it too.  For reverence, I am 5'3&#34;, 145 lbs, wear a 34DD and the large was perfect and not too tight."

5.0,"Perfect fit, wonderful fabric - soft without cling, doesn't make skin clammy in hot weather, very comfortable and smart-looking design!  Wash in cold water.  Will buy another."
5.0,I love these pajamas! They are lightweight and soft
5.0,"Fits well, not too tight but not falling off. The cups are a different shape than what I usually see, which makes it a bit awkward, but not too noticeable. They're removable too which is nice. Overall, fantastic, especially for the price."
5.0,"What soft, simple, and sexy dress! I'm 5'2&quot; 125lbs 32DD and ordered a small. Fits perfectly as a short dress. I like my dresses pretty short so this is perfect, but other folks may like feel more comfortable with pantyhose or tights on underneath. I personally love it as is - I'm comfortable in my own skin to let my butt flash a bit.<br /><br />I ordered 2 originally, the heather grey one had a hole in it - free return shipping no problem so I already ordered another!"
5.0,Fits great and its comfortable.
5.0,"My mom got it for me for Christmas and I love it , I wear it every day,I would recommend buy it"
5.0,This is my new favorite shirt! It looks great and feels great and it washes great! I have ordered 2 so far and I am tempted to order a 3rd one.
5.0,Nice skirt its nice and fitted perfect with Vans.  I ended up changing my outfit idea so I did return it.
5.0,I like it better with lock.

5.0,"Fabric is soft and comfortable to wear, the sizing was good too!!!"
5.0,"These are great.  I thought maybe I could wear them more than one way, but I decided I only liked them when they are completely threaded through and the small bar is on my earlobe.  Really nice looking especially for the price."
5.0,Excellent clip-ons. Come in a nice slim rigid case & once you realize theres a little sort of button bar to open the clip it fits perfect. Polarized too.
5.0,"Nice product, necessary in the new world we live in. Would recommend!"
5.0,this piece was nicer than expected. great buy. daughter loved it...

5.0,"I didn’t realize when I bought this hat that the top part is also adjustable!! Which was an awesome surprise! The wide brim allows extra coverage for the neck.

5.0,good support and good fit
5.0,"I bought this as a loose-fitting maternity dress that will hopefully also work for breast feeding and thereafter as just a regular summer dress. I am currently 7 mos preg, average size for 5’7. This dress is very simple and could be duplicated using it as a pattern for other dresses. There is really no shape to it yet is somehow flattering. The neckline is low (but I wanted that for breastfeeding). I do think this is a very versatile dress that is definitely worth the money."
5.0,Good product quick delivery
5.0,I like the style and comfort and especially the handy pockets. I wear it when cooking or baking to protect clothing. Have looked for this style for years with no success. Overjoyed to find it on Amazon

5.0,"This is a fantastic band. So easy to customize the size, looks great, easy to swap out with the original band. Why Fitbit isn't selling this is beyond me. I was tired of waiting for FItbit to release its own stainless steel band, and when I found this instead, I was thrilled."
5.0,"Exactly what I ordered, very nice."
5.0,"I love these rings. They are very durable and wear well. Don't be fooled by the price, they are suburb."
5.0,"Glitter gets everywhere! Beware But, pretty as a favor."
5.0,"I have purchased several “dress” sweaters for my granddaughters, but this is the nicest. The sweater and detailing are much nicer than many other sweaters and shrugs  I have purchased. The price was not much more than inferior quality items."
5.0,Great. We loved it
5.0,I am happy with my birthday present it goes well with my other lotus items from alex and ani.
5.0,"Nice soft scuba fabric. Fit a little larger than I'd like. I'm curvy, 5-6, 38D, 170 lbs. I ordered XL. The shape was very figure flattering to enhance hourglass shape. Will have altered on the straps to keep them stationery. Body tape on bra and dress will keep boobs from falling out. Pleased with this purchase!"
5.0,These are cute! They're not too small but are not too big to be gaudy or overpowering. They were the perfect accessory to add a unique touch to an outfit. I've worn them in professional and casual settings and receive compliments everytime.
5.0,My Grandson Loves it and will grow into it.
5.0,My kids love them. They are 4 and 1.5 and the hats fit great.
5.0,Love this dress we are on another one and another color
5.0,I've used some HK clips in the past that were pretty low quality. These are great. Super-high quality. Really couldn't be happier with them.
5.0,It's an awesome shirt the matieraly is silky but heavier weight than I expected .  it's long enough to ware with a pair of legging and will look great with jeans.
5.0,My husband has a really hard time finding slippers that fit him properly because his feet are so wide. These fit and the quality was good.
5.0,"This is a cute cropped top I would like to wear when going out. The material was better then I expected, it's smooth and very comfy. Love it :)"
5.0,I just love the choker. It's absolutely beautiful
5.0,I usually wear medium but I had to size up since the sizing runs small.  This dress though is very cute.
5.0,"Very nice looking, good quality materials used. I bought it for motorcycle riding as it's waterproof. Have yet to try it in the rain since it hasn't rained here for 2 years! But I now use it for daily wear. My only complaint is it is a bit small for my everyday use. But since I bought it for MC riding, I didn't want it too big. It is just the right size for that purpose."
5.0,"I ordered these for my husband to wear to a Roaring 20's party........wow, were we surprised at the good quality. fit and design.  We expected something flimsy that just slipped over his shoe, but instead these arrived with excellent quality, thick fabric, actual snaps to close the spats, nice elastic strap to go under the shoe to hold them in place.  Great buy!!!"
5.0,I like it a lot and at a good price!!<br />And just in time for Christmas :)
5.0,"I love the LOVIANI headbands, I have them in 3 colors, the bands are very soft, comfortable and fashionable, and my friends are asking me where did I get them and of course I said amazon, the bands are awesome, I am very pleased, thank you! ☺"
5.0,"We absolutely love our customized bobble heads!  They are fun and creative and generate lots of good conversation. We've gotten one for each family member - it's a great gift when you want something creative and personal (and they are very reasonably priced to boot). I highly recommend this product and this company- you will not be disappointed. Mixee Labs customer service is also terrific - timely, efficient, and a pleasure to work with."
5.0,Fits well and is so so so so soft!
5.0,Quick delivery and item arrived exactly as described.
5.0,Very nice you can wear it everyday I love gold but it’s just a little to tight for my liking but it looks good on my daughter
5.0,"I’m definitely not small and this dress looks great. I wish they had more colors! Good quality and true to size. I will warn that at 5’7 all of Five Cats interior slips are too short, but that’s easily solved by wearing a slip, leggings, or shorts. I do wish they would make them like two inches longer."
5.0,"they were exactly what i expected very nice. merry Christmas all, they will make a perfect gift especially a last minute gift."
5.0,Nice fit and fashionable 🙌
5.0,"I like it, good quality, just the right size too. I'm that nerdy girl who is not into decorative hearts :)"
5.0,"This watch is amazing, I worked heavily with it, not a scratch, both time displays (analog and digital) work perfectly, even after a few bangs against my wheelchair's iron frame.<br /><br />I love its date display, how well protected are the buttons and how steady its crown is.  I will add the white and yellow versions of the ""KXAITO Men's Watches Sports Outdoor Waterproof Military Wrist Watch"" to my collection."
5.0,"Love these! Beautiful, comfortable, perfect for any occasion!"
5.0,"Fit is not an issue, unless your head is super huge. Light weight material, so will be cool on the hot sunny days."
5.0,Gorg
5.0,Very comfortable! Love these.
5.0,Flattering and very comfortable
5.0,I got these as a stocking stuffer for my mother and she loves them!
5.0,"So I had bought 2 set of the 3XL for my two MALE friends, one is 6'2 and the other is 5'10. I bought these knowing these are designed for girls, but man, a Men's medium being the equivalent of a 3XL? It's the largest size too. Besides all of that, if you follow the measurements on the charts you will get the exact size you need. The sizes hold true to the measurement/size chart provided, which I am extremely grateful for!<br /><br />As for the material and overall look this is amazing for the price and speed of delivery. Just make sure you iron this on the lowest setting on your iron after you open because it has some heavy wrinkles/creases from being packed in the amazon shipping bag."
5.0,"Exactly what I was expecting, good quality!"
5.0,Will fit in the smallest hole.  May need to punch one or two more.
5.0,As comfortable as pajamas but easily dressed up to go out! Very stretchy can go down a size great value for the price.
5.0,Very cute shoes. My 6year old loves them. The heel is not too high for her to wear but she still feels like she is wearing “high heels” so far the Velcro has held up nicely. Very happy with these shoes
5.0,"This ring is so very pretty, and the price is great, I really Love it! I wear it almost every day, LOVE IT."
5.0,These shades are great!
5.0,My hubby loves his ring and loves showing it off any chance he gets!
5.0,Chain is gorgeous.  Wears beautifully on neck with or without pendant.  Will not tarnish.
5.0,"I am tall, with a 34&#34; inseam, and these skirts are my preferred length hitting about half-way between my ankles and just below the knee.  The fit is as expected.  They have washed well."
5.0,"I bought this for my 14 year old grandson, and he absolutely loves it.  His eyes lit up when he opened it, and he spent the rest of the night figuring out all the things he can do with it.  I don't think it's been off his wrist since.  He loves the blue back lighting as well."
5.0,"Stunning in black! It is the perfect size... not too small, but not huge either. I'm actually used to large handbags/purses, and this is definitely LARGE. It is very shiny, trendy, and elegant, especially with the fancy gold chain in front. Inside it is roomy and has a good size pocket for my cell phone, etc. I like the striped interior in beige and brown -- looks classy. The top folds over and snaps shut with no problem. It also comes with a long strap, so I can actually carry/hold the purse three different ways. It stands upright on its own without slouching over (unlike my previous purse) when I place it on the counter. Anyway, I purchased this handbag because my previous purse finally fell apart, so it was time for an upgrade. By the way, this purse is lead and nickel safe."
5.0,"Shipping took a couple weeks, but got what I expected for price. Surprisingly it’s lined and not see through. I could’ve ordered a smaller size but I always ordered the largest size just because these things tend to run small"
5.0,Purchased for my wife and she loved it.
5.0,Beautiful watch enjoying it. My coworkers like it as well
5.0,I love the Gaiam clothing line.  They always fit extremely well.  The colors are vibrant.  I own over 10 pair of pants and wear them everywhere.  I have all lengths and colors.
5.0,This is alot prettier in person So happy I ordered it
5.0,Great looking and good fit .
5.0,"Got this as a backup Halloween outfit (with jacket) and since it was hot outside, this worked out perfect. Fits wonderfully and he had loads of room for ""max comf""."
5.0,"Incredible quality for the price! Good looking and comfortable to wear, just whatI was looking for to avoid wearing glasses over glasses while driving or walking!"
5.0,I like these jeans alot true to size and very comfortable
5.0,This necklace was beautiful. I bought it for a Christmas present and the person whom received it also loved it.
5.0,The work.  You have to get use to putting them on.  It take a minute to get them on right.  I am glad I purchased them.  I worn a bra without one and the rash came right back.  I have to wear one every time I wear a bra.  These kept me from throwing away all my bra and buying the one with cotton on the bottom.  These liner serve that purpose.
5.0,"Hasn't broken yet, is cute and inexpensive"
5.0,They’re so cute. Goes with almost everything I wear. Super comfy and is adjustable for a better fit. I been wearing them almost everyday since I had them. I even accidentally  fall asleep with it on sometimes because I forget I’m wearing it. For a choker they’re lovely comfort wise and sexy as hell. XX
5.0,"Really good value for a lite weight “performance” shirt.<br />Beach, running, errands, you name it"
5.0,Works good. As advertised.
5.0,"This dress is a steal for the price and will serve its function. The material is thin and inexpensive but thick enough to pass for a decent work dress or for a semi-formal affair, and definitely not see through in black. It runs small but hugs in all of the right places if you have a proportionally smaller waste or hourglass figure, thanks to the belt for cinching!  I am 5'""11, 165lbs, with DD chest, wider hips (and small love handles) and a narrower waist, approximately 36"", 31, 36"" and the 2XL fits pretty well, maybe a little on the snug side but not too snug/sexy to wear to work. Normally I'm a size 10/12.  As soon as I tried it on I immediately went to purchase in a few other colors but it was already sold out in this style! Please bring this dress back in 2XL and I'll purchase again!<br />I'm only taking away one star because it does not have a tag with care instructions so I'll be forced to test that out and run the risk of ruining. It does have a tag that says 95% polyester 5% spandex. Hope this is helpful!!!"
5.0,"It's a nice, basic locket.  I got what I expected to get without any surprises."
5.0,Awesome look just like product no complaints
5.0,This watch turns heads. Exactly as described. Its light weight the magnet wrist band is amazing. The sparkle makes it Devine. I bought two. This one and a purple one.
5.0,Love this for a summer dress! It’s so comfortable & cute!
5.0,Finally A piece of clothing that does fit as expected. Usually I get a medium or even a large and it won't pass my shoulders. And I am not a big person. Nothing makes me angrier when a seller says it fits as expected and it fits for a child. I had bought this as a XXL after buying several shirts that fit super small.<br />What is funny is I was so mad that it actually was a XXL.  So I had to reorder and get Mediums. The other shirts are perfect as Christmas gifts.
5.0,Arrived on time. Appeared to be good quality.
5.0,"Fits just right ! Nice pattern on the joggers . Light weight material,  all around good ."
5.0,"The pants fit so good, comfortable."
5.0,great product and fast service
5.0,Great product and easy to set up. Casio has only the best!!
5.0,These are beautiful masks!! Got one in all colors to match my dresses!!
5.0,Beautifully old-fashion.
5.0,"The cutest most wonderfully tacky earings. If u want to be fun and get lots of attention, wear these earrings. They are simply the best. Buy them as a gift for teens and tweens or for any dino loving friend. GET THEM!"
5.0,Excellent accessory to my wardrobe
5.0,"I got this as a gift for a bridesmaid - thought it would be a nice to give them each a pin they can wear the day of with their dress or whenever.<br /><br />A great quality item. Seems very sturdy and just the right amount of sparkle. It is actually pretty large but since it has space between the metal, it isn't overwhelming. A great find!"
5.0,"These fit perfectly! i haven’t washed them yet but they are super stretchy. i love that they have an option of three different colors or all three the same. i ordered a Medium (all 3 black), like most things i order online and they aren’t uncomfortably tight."
5.0,Hot gear very sexy two bad they fit loose in the thighs I don't have big thighs so there loose fitting I love the wetlook Playsuit I would recommend  to anyone who likes fetish gear.
5.0,Arrived Early. Happy with the purchase.
5.0,"I cannot say enough nice thing about this pulover.  The fit is excellent and it is extremely comfortable.  I am 6' 1"" and weigh 185.  I typically fall right between a large and an XL.  For long sleeve items a large is usually a little tight and XL is a little big.  I ordered a large and the fit is absolutely perfect.  Time will tell how it hold up, but upon initial inspection and washing it seems like it will wear well.  I own many other brands of pullovers and this is by far my favorite.  Going to order a few more."
5.0,These little earring are gorgeous....I love them
5.0,I use this for any stadium/concerts that I go to. Far too often I find myself at the gate with my solid bag and being turned away. Now I just carry this bag and it works for almost all events. I can throw it over my shoulder and don't have to keep up with it. Makes everything more enjoyable. It is small enough that it is not in the way but large enough for all the items I need.
5.0,"Love the colors, bands are easy to install, feels comfortable on my wrist and above all: great quality. Bands doesn’t feel like they will break easily like other bands I’ve bought in the past from other merchants. Definitely will buy other colors.. I am very happy with my purchase."
5.0,Cute soft and warm
5.0,"I have bought many pairs of reading glasses through the years.  I would rate these the best in fit, quality of the lenses and durability.  I have dropped them many times onto the wood flooring and they haven’t popped a lens like others have.  The spring hinges keep them on well when looking down at my work without being overly tight.  Definitely recommend."
5.0,Great Dri-Fit shirt.  True to size.  Great color.
5.0,Pretty. I had it put together and used as a charm
5.0,"Love how detailed it is even for its small size and it fits perfectly on my bag, back is super strong. Would buy from again!!"
5.0,Everyone loves this shirt
5.0,"This shirt is great! I have a big neck but much smaller waist than regular size. When they say it is slim fit, they mean it. It fits perfectly!!! I definitely buy some more in other colors."
5.0,This is the 2nd one I ordered. it's long and looks good. I'm 5'8&#34; and 210 lbs. I ordered the 2XL.  I wore it on vacation and I often wore it as a skirt. It was my go to swimsuit.
5.0,"VERY WARM, GREAT PRICE, THICK AND WELL MADE."
5.0,"Nice item, well made."
5.0,These finished off a cute outfit but these were not ideal for the fight club I’m in. They were not durable enough for even the first fight. Just keep them on long enough to warm your hands before your fights. Buy the darker ones to hid blood stains.
5.0,"This pin is a breathtakingly beautiful piece of jewelery! It is large, and slightly ""weighty"". This pin is not going to be available any longer, as it was a gift-of-state,and as of now, no items with that ""connection"" will be made ! If you can acquire this piece somehow, by all means do so....it is simply exquisite! I like the Jackie brooches,as some of them, like this one, can be worn on a very dressy item,as well as on an older, well-worn faded jean jacket,and look hip,classy,stylish, and fresh!"
5.0,I love this mask. Perfect for summer.
5.0,"This jumpsuit was perfect for my needs, which was Halloween costume in general and, more specifically, the ability to do a workout (running, hill sprints) for a challenge I participated in. Size small was perfect; I am 5’3”, 119. It was flexible and comfortable enough to warm up/stretch, do the hill sprints, not see-through or too tight."
5.0,Good shirt. Fits perfect to size. Material is excellent
5.0,"Nice, simple dress. Fits well."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:e02895be0cc431977da346d8c70ad249]] I’m very happy with this watch! I looked for a very long time for something classy, not too small but also not too big, black to match my work style, elegant watch face, and not too expensive. This watch covers all of that - and it arrived quickly and packaged nicely! There is no audible ticking (which I like) and the hands move and seem to be keeping accurate time so far. If you’re on the fence like I was I’d say go for it!"
5.0,So nice. Bought it for my daughter and she loves the dress!
5.0,"Bought these for my husband and he will not where it because it is TOOOO BLINGY,if you like bling this is the watch for you,great watch"
5.0,"I like the orange tint of this pair, clear and true to the color. Very light, while sturdy enough to provide a comfortable fit. I already used them for my outdoor activities, and it holds well in my running, biking and some other sports. The case and that little pouch in the package come handy, with them, I'm pretty sure the coating on the lenses will last much longer than my other pairs."
5.0,The case for these sunglasses is super cool and feels durable. The sunglasses also fit very nicely to my face. Perfect for driving when the sun is in your face.
5.0,This coverup is beautiful.<br />The colorz are bold.
5.0,My wife loved this it added glitz to her bracelet.
5.0,Gave this to my grandson. He loves it a lot beautiful time piece
5.0,"Grandkids loved them, fit perfectly."
5.0,I bought this as a gift. She loved it.
5.0,They fit great! Great quality! We got a lot of compliments also😍
5.0,Unfortunately I had to return it because it doesn't match my shoe
5.0,"I liked it because it came on time before I needed to wear my uniform, and the badge looked like the exact one I would  pick up at the military exchange.  I used it for my uniform to wear on my inspection day."
5.0,"Great too. Small fits well, I am 34DD"
5.0,I should've gotten a smaller size but the color is gorgeous and the dress is soooooo cute!!
5.0,"The gloves fit comfortably and are extremely warm. I haven’t had an opportunity to use them in any type of wet weather, But I’m please so far."
5.0,This shirt is so nice. Thick soft material. Nice sturdy patch on front. Not just cheap vinyl. Very nice shirt
5.0,I truly do love these earrings.  I have been getting compliments when I wear them.  I am enjoying them.
5.0,Happy Camper I Am!

5.0,Im a big guy and this shirt fits just right. Its light so you are not all hot and sweaty.
5.0,This is the perfect belt for children and kids who wait until the last minute to go to the bathroom and are in a hurry!<br />It also looks pretty cool and helps to hold pants up for slim children!  I got one for my grandson and he loves it!
5.0,"Its perfect! My daughter is 3 months, will be 4 by the 30th. The outfits fits a bit large, but it's perfect. I cant wait for her to wear is this thanksgivings"
5.0,"I don't see these at dollar stores, etc., and they are inexpensive and very popular with 6-8 year old kids."
5.0,"If you want to wear a board/swim short, and still look sort of dressy with a nice shirt, these are your jam. Perfect for a hot day at the golf course as they look good with a golf shirt. Your favorite t-shirt also looks great with these for any occasion as well. These don't really look like swim shorts that much, which is nice to have sometimes.<br />  Reference:  I am size 32/34 ,  so i got these in a 33 which fits perfect."
5.0,Love them! Very cute and comfy.
5.0,This shirt is really soft and fits great. I would recommend it!! True to size fit perfect
5.0,The three year old ballerina loves it.
5.0,Ladies these are the best tragus earrings ive ever bought..they are sooo cute and such a great deal. Buy buy buy!
5.0,"I give it a 5 star rating for the price. Small if you are a full C cup or bigger. Very light material, cute feminine pattern, seems to be very delicate material and easy to rip so put on wirh care don't tug or pull if you want it to look good for a while I haven't used it. I wonder how it will do after the washer I also wouldn't put it in the dryer. Air dry most of thin materials. This bra is super cute and will be buying more from them I wish they had bigger cup sizes."
5.0,"Love these pjs!  Comfortable, great fabric, beautiful, wash up perfectly."

5.0,Perfect.exactly what I was expecting. Only downfall took a long time to get to me
5.0,Very flowy but it’s hug your body too. Kinda long for me but if I wear heels will do.
5.0,Great value for money! They look adorable on my 9 month old granddaughter... highly recommend!
5.0,The bag is really cute and bright. It is a good size as described in the dimensions. I have not used it yet but am very happy with it.
5.0,"I love cats plus this bag. I'm glad I bought it,I was looking for a smaller bag to use for the next few months as I'll be getting surgery starting next month and this was it. This is Well made and cute..<br />I wasn't sure at 1st because they didn't have very good pictures, so I'll add some in my review. I added my wallet and my battery charger so you can get a idea on the size. There's a smaller zip pocket in side the larger pocket. Lots of room for my basic items,smartphone, wallet,cords for my cellphone and some makeup. Will buy more soon..."
5.0,Fits my wallet perfect. Would order again.
5.0,"Beautiful color , size , & variety . Beyond happy wit my order"

It seems a little large on me, BUT I ordered it a size bigger just in case it ran small so that was completely on me. Since it is a bathing suit cover up, I figured it is not really a big deal. Black yes, but still very sheer! Very cute little item to add to the mix for summer!"
5.0,Great day and casual evening outfit. Each time I wear the dress got compliments. Good price too.
5.0,"I was dubious when I ordered this part for my Coolaroo shade.  The catch for the wand broke off and I could not roll the shade up or down.  The parts arrived really quickly and they were exactly what I needed to fix my shade, so much less expensive than replacing the whole shade. I was surprised the fit was perfect."
5.0,Hat was just as pictured
5.0,Bought this for the wife and she loves it. Fits great around the ear.
5.0,My husband thought that the bullet cuff links were great.  You dont notice what they are at first.
5.0,"Love this purse! I debated on getting this purse and a couple other purses for literally a month. I then decided for the price and the brand, this would be the best one and I was right! The material is quality, and it's even cuter in person. It's just the right size, I can easily fit my Kate spade wallet, sunglasses with its case, keys, iPhone 6, and other things like tissues and pens. It can fit an iPad mini as well with all that. I was weary it doesn't zip, but everything stays in with no problem and the clasp is cute, though I barely use it. It's really the perfect purse! Love it for all seasons!"
5.0,a great jacket love it!!!!!
5.0,"I love this bikini it looks great, the pictures don’t do it justice.<br />The bottoms are a little big but it didn’t stop me from wearing it."
5.0,"Very comfortable, you can adjust the size with the straps, breathable, and does not fog up your glasses when you’re breathing with the mask on! The design is really good too!"
5.0,"My son goes to the mountains with his friends at least a couple times a year. Last year we were unprepared and trying to find thermals in Southern CA is not an easy feat. These are thin enough to be worn under any clothes he will wear, he can still layer and they are so ridiculously soft and will keep him warm."
5.0,Crist and white - professional.
5.0,Nice glasses would buy again
5.0,Product as described. My daughter lost her high school softball pin and this looked just like it. It was perfect. Would order again.
5.0,"Bought for 9-year old who wears size 4 kids shoes, she adores them so much I bought her additional multi puppy pack of them."
5.0,"Love it! Fun but not flashy. People who are into Star Wars notice it, but it doesn’t flaunt that I’m really a twelve year old stuck in an aging mans body."
5.0,Beautiful piece!!!
5.0,"I love this bracelet. It is perfect. It is even more beautiful than I had hoped for. Very nice, quality workmanship, just the right size, not too big, not too small, feminine, nice shine, smooth edges. I could not be happier. And the price was amazing. Look like it cost a lot more than I paid."

5.0,looked awesome for halloween
5.0,This hat is a steal. Trust me you'll miss out if you don't but it. To me the hat looks bluish in the picture but it's black. It's adorable and we'll worth every single sent.
5.0,This belt is more than I expected.  It looks as good or better than the ones I saw in the bridal shops. It is well made and held up beautifully through the whole wedding day and still looks phenomenal
5.0,"This is a beautiful robe. One small caveat - the sleeves are not as long as pictured, and they are not kimono sleeves."
5.0,My cat loves to play but doesn’t know how to not use his claws. I bought these to be able to play with him and they work great. I started by just petting him with them and now we’re rough house a little with him. He purrs the whole time and always comes back for more! And I don’t come out shredded to pieces

5.0,Nice quality.  Good deal.
5.0,So I've opened the package everything it's a good looking jumpsuit and I did forget about the embellish sleeve but now that I see it all together now I got to find a shoe for the entire look because it does fit me really well ..so this is a good date night with the hubby
5.0,"Versatile. Nice weight crepe fabric - not see thru. This can be worn as a light jacket over a blouse, as a tunic blouse, with a cami. Belted or un belted with tights, jeans, pants, with a pencil skirt. It's a great piece, & great value. The sizing is accurate from the provided chart. Meanor is a reliable brand, I have purchased a few of their pieces & have found then to be pieces I wear over & over, to many  compliments."
5.0,These are lovely gloves and can be worn during the day as well at night.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

5.0,I like it better than the $382 bag I saw at Dillard's and it holds all my stuff!
5.0,"The product keeps your mask off of your face so people can understand you better.  As a teacher, it is very valuable to have my students understand what I am saying."
5.0,I’ve been trying to find a good push up bra for awhile now and none of them have been that great until I decided to buy this one. They are super comfortable and have no wires. They also really do give a great lift! I ended up buying all the colors they have available.

5.0,"I love these socks! So thick and comfy, and the compression feels so good on my arches perfect fit as well."
5.0,"The face protector works. I had surgery on my schnoz and wore the face protector to basketball practice a week after surgery. I successfully took a basketball off the side of my face (blind sided) and the protector did its job to protect my nose. It obviously still hurt, but there was no damage to my face or nose. Only negative is that the players call me ""Coach Hannibal Lecter"" and I frighten small children when I wear it. Nose is safe and secure though."
5.0,"For costume jewelry this item is magnificent and quite the bargain for the price. Pictures do not do this piece justice. Shipping from SG Paris is slow, and communication is less than professional."
5.0,"The sunglasses fit perfectly on my head, they aren't small and I have a regular sized head. The quality looks and feels great. If you want to buy good quality sunglasses for a cheap price then this is what you want."
5.0,I bought several of these for neices/nephews for Christmas. Ages were 3-14. The kids all wore them Christmas Day and wrote messages on each other. The youngest is 3 and her shirt was too big but we didn't want to leave her out. Kids loved them.
5.0,"Multi points of Velcro allow perfect adjustment to make this as tight as you wish, or loose for comfort. Just enough sweat to do the trick."
5.0,"I bought a XXL and I just knew I was going to be disappointed, but I was actually amazed that I wasn’t let down. I love the material and I do have to admit it does shed some when you’re unraveling it. But you will not be disappointed."
5.0,My 2 year old granddaughter loves Minnie Mouse. And she loved her costume. Reasonably priced
5.0,"As complicated as this system just is, this set was done well.  My daughters looked up some youtube tutorials that helped with how to get it all put on correctly...then they slipped carefully out of it so the next time it won't be like starting over!  LOL!"
5.0,"Ordered the black/white pair for my 8 year old son.  He likes them and they seem well made.  Could use some adjacent to get them to sit perfectly on his face, but that's to be expected."
5.0,"Cute& comfy, went perfect with my shoes.."

5.0,"This bag is very well made, and there are so many pockets for a smallish bag.  Love it."

5.0,Gave these as gifts to my EMS friends. They are absolutely awesome.  I love them.
5.0,"Beautiful dress! It is packaged flat in a resealable bag so I knew I would need to steam fluff if before wearing but it is very fluffy after just hanging it up for 24 hours. My Little flower girl loves it and danced around like a little princess.  I love the liner that keeps her from feeling the tulle against her skin. Beautiful dress, great price."

5.0,"I wanted to post a picture of this neckless to show how stunning it goes with black but was unable to download the picture.  I will try later.  I got this at a discount for my honest review.

5.0,It's a nice summer cardigan. I like that the material is a thick chiffon so it's not too sheer and it can be worn dressy or casual.
5.0,"These are gorgeous--they are a touch on the narrow side across the toes, but I fully expect them to stretch.  The purple color is rich and deep and the part in the hell is darker in the picture, so it looks even better.  I would love a wine color. Hint, hint--Floopi!"
5.0,I'm 5'5 and 145lbs with average build and medium was perfect. Absolutely love this shirt and the price! Already received compliments and great materials for upcoming summer days.

My daughter just turned 10mo and is a little over 20lbs, and currently in 6,9&12mo clothes depending on the brand.

5.0,I absolutely LOVE these earrings!! I had a pair very similar to these and lost one. I was so upset because I wore them quite often. So needless to say I was pleased when I found these. They are well made and just the right size. LOVE THEM!!!!!
5.0,pretty and lacy goes well with my camio earrings!

5.0,"Fit liner good,warm"
5.0,"Really nice sunglasses,  very comfortable and stylish. I've been told I have a big head, sorry no tape measure but they are nice and comfy on my big brain holder. Read the fine print, this company really stands behind their product. Removes any fear of online purchasing!! Buy with confidence."
5.0,I had a terry cloth one that was just too hot to use during the summer.  This one is light weight and breathes great without making me sweat down there.

5.0,My niece loved this phone case.
5.0,"This definitely helps - especially when using it on an Orion 15174 padded case to tote an OTA like the Orion XT10-i.  It attached to the available cloth loops with a large S-Hook on each side.  Of course, I'm presuming that the Magna Cart telescoping hand truck will make hauling it even easier (and help me avoid another visit to the chiropractor who used to own her) if it ever comes in (shipped July 11 now theoretically arriving in Mountain Rest on August 1st - maybe).  At least according to the &#34;Village Idiots&#34; we've got several good viewing nights coming up, so until the cart comes in, the shoulder strap will be getting quite a workout."
5.0,"This belt is decently made, serves its purpose well as a Christmas holiday belt but I think can be used as everyday accessory. It's bright and would go great with dark color outfit, would make it pop, so to speak. I love it. It's like a splash of color. I recommend it."

5.0,"I really love the off the shoulder dress, it’s very pretty & perfect for spring/summer! However, it was not fitting at all... it ran a bit big but was still really cute! Check out my Instagram for many other great fashion, beauty, and home finds - @landonhopestevens 💗"
5.0,"beautiful bag, too small for my needs"
5.0,It's a beautiful necklace! Exactly what I was looking for :-)
5.0,Great quality! Fit as expected!
5.0,"Holy canoli, these things took me right back to the 80s and early 90s. They remind me of pants we would have seen on TV back then. They are so loud they are almost painful to look at, but that was the whole point, so I like them a lot. They will be great for lounging around the house."
5.0,Classic and Bombproof.  I will buy this watch over and over until CASIO literally goes TU.
5.0,got this for my wife. Very handy to hold her glasses

5.0,Bag was exactly as described. Roomy and good bag for everyday.
5.0,"Ok first, I love this suit but I hate the cups that are sewn in. I bought this suit in a 10-12 because I am so large busted, I'd hoped that the cups would accommodate larger busts, but I was wrong.  I had to have them removed and cups from an old bra sewn in to make this work.  Now the cups fit but the rest of the suit is too baggy. Great price.  I am a 38G so suit are hard to fit sometimes.  This suit would have been so much better if they accounted for the girth and weight of large busted women.  If you have a seamstress, are a seamstress or are willing to take it to a seamstress to have the cups altered, this is a great suit, just buy your true size then have it altered."
5.0,Was exactly what I thought I would get great quality
5.0,First off: Fits as expected means tight! If you're in between sizes you are safe with the larger size. They adjust well.<br /><br />Great quality. Consistent. Thick not see through. Comfy. Long lasting. Tummy flattering. Good length. Dark Black. Not slippery. Fashionably accepted by picky teens and middle aged mum's.

5.0,"Just the right size.  This bag carries all the essentials and the strap fits comfortably across the body.  The small zipper compartment holds car keys, compact and lipstick.  It's an attractive bag; just what I was looking for.  I just wish it came in more colors."

5.0,Came with 2 tonges as described.  Easy to install.  Color and MATTE finish match the apple watch rose gold series 3 perfectly.  Make sure you measure the width of the band at the buckle (since some bands are tapered) to select the right  size.  20 mm means it will fit the 20 mm-wide-band at the buckle.
5.0,Wife wore the pendet 4 mothers day and she received many positive comments.

I'm 5&#34;4- 160lb. lg fit great. I chose XL to avoid that type of  attention. The quality of this dress Is good."
5.0,Good quality XL fit my 12 yr old
5.0,Very good quality and a good price !!
5.0,Purchased for my wife as a gift.  She shows it off to family and friends.
5.0,It's lovely!
5.0,"well made.  enough pockets for my credit cards. place for cash. the fact that it zips around gives me a feeling of security, others  tend to let the cards fall out"
5.0,"Love the shirt, just the right size & I like it, well made!"
5.0,The cutest shoe EVER .. I started with black/brown and then bought hunter green/black !!  I want raspberry next .. make sure you know your EU true size .. I'm an 81/2 and I needed an EU 40 💜✌🏻‼️
5.0,My daughter likes it especially she is in the computer all day for her school class.
5.0,"Love, love, love!!! Was worried after reading some of the reviews, but I've had 0 issues!!  My versa fits in it perfectly and has never fallen out. I've had it for 4 months now, using this case, and it doesn't have a single scratch and I don't have a screen protector.  I do wear my watch on the inside of my wrist rather than the regular way, but I don't think that makes a difference. If anything, I knock it on more stuff wearing it this way.  I did order a pink one as well, but I never use that one. It wasn't the same color as in the picture. It's more of an off white than pink, which was dissapointing, so I never use it. I wish I had gotten the purple instead of the pink."
5.0,"I love this little tank.  The material is thick enough that you are unable to see through it.<br /><br />It fits snug around the chest area, loose in the mid section, and snug at the hips so it hides the areas it needs to.<br /><br />The tie is also super cute and adds a little interest.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this tank and have purchased in multiple colors!"
5.0,Was a Christmas gift for my wife.  She loved it.  Excellent quality.
5.0,"So the thing about this dress is that it clings to the mid section. It accentuates your curves, your belly. If you buy the right size to where it fits properly in the bust, it is going to cling to your stomach and gradually let off at the hips. At first I wasn't sure I liked it. Also, it took a minute to fish the straps through (with tweezers) to make it tie nicely. However, the thing is that it is actually a really flattering dress. Despite not preferring my tummy being accentuated (because our culture tells us there is something wrong with our bodies as they are), the dress feels like it celebrates the body in a lovely way. The pattern, length, cut, it all is very chic and sexy and makes for an understated feminine look. The fabric is decent quality, too. So, I decided to just be ok with my tummy pooch. And I am really glad because it was a great dress to wear on vacation, super soft and light-weight without being see-through. I wore soft white cotton panties and a sleep bra, and you couldn't see them at all. Talk about comfy on vaca. And it also looked great as a bathing suit cover, and is easy to pull off and put back on without re-tying. This is probably my favorite sundress now. For measurements, I am 34DD, 36"" hips, 5'4.5, 133 lb, and bought size Small. The length hit just above the knee, in a good way."
5.0,"I have biked over 50,000 miles and tried several gloves over the years these have to be the best. Comfort and the padding is badass!"
5.0,So I bought this dress to turn it into my Halloween costume. But I will be buying it again because it is so pretty and comfortable!
5.0,Super neat for all ages
5.0,Soft and looks great in our guest bathroom
5.0,"It comes down to just above my knees, I'm 5 ft tall.  Great fit, mauve is a good color too.  If you live in a hot and humid place then this is a good buy."
5.0,"I can't believe this jacket was so inexpensive, but feels so luxurious.  I really love the color (caramel - which seems to be the ""it"" color this year) and feel of the material.  It's perfect."
5.0,Really nice quality. My Grandaughter loved it. Actually wore it without the shirt. Fit was as expected.
5.0,Beautiful dress for a great price. Wore it to a wedding and got lots of compliments. I love how versatile it is!
5.0,These are awesome! The only no show socks that don't slide off my heels!
5.0,"package arrived on time, ring in perfect condition.  Followed the directions on the webpage for sizing, but it was off- so had to return and reorder the correct size- no problems in doing that at all.  However, the size we calculated was 9 and it turned out 6 was the right one."
5.0,"Fits perfectly.  It's a stretchy fabric, so it has a little give"
5.0,Have a wife who loves Star Wars? Want to get her something that will be a conversation starter and look really pretty at parties? Buy these and it'll be the easiest jewelry purchase you've ever made!
5.0,"I'm extremely impressed by these! Comfortable, decent-size pockets, and true to size. Will probably get another pair or two."

5.0,"Muy buena calidad la tela de la camisa, la garantizo."
5.0,"...~ LOVE!!! I received it within a week. Dasein has superb bags that are well made, posh and at an affordable price! The quality is excellent!! I had bought one at TJ Maxx years ago and still looks new!!! This is essentially 2 bags, 2 straps! I especially love the braided strap! I will definitely be ordering more!!!"
5.0,Absolutely love! Perfect fit

5.0,"LOOKS GREAT , FITS GREAT!"
5.0,my sister in Germany loves it
5.0,"The BeSteel Punk Rock Leather Bracelet arrived promptly through Amazon Prime.  I'll be honest, I have something of an addiction to bracelets. I'm not a real flashy guy and I don't wear any jewelry other than my wedding ring. That is why I love to wear bracelets. They look cool, but they are still modest and understated. And they are fun. I started with those cheap friendship style bracelets, but they fall off or break. When I discovered this type of jewelry on Amazon, I started buying them. Unfortunately, my results have been decidedly mixed. Some have been too big or too small. They often have really stupid clasps that are awkward or magnets that aren't reliable. I became to skeptical, that I mostly stopped buying them. I was offered a small discount for a fair and unbiased review of this bracelet, so I decided to give it a try. I gave this bracelet 5 stars because it is perfectly designed.  I have very average sized wrists and usually find these types of bracelets to be a bit too big, but this one is just perfect.  It is very well crafted.  The bracelet looks exactly like the advertising picture.  The stainless steel dividers and the decorative stainless steel center piece are very classy and stand out, but without being gaudy or distracting.  I will wear this bracelet frequently with both business and casual clothing.  The leather is beautiful and very high-quality. The leather is a dark black and it is very handsome. The silver clasp is highly-polished and classy with a strong magnetic clasp. The connector is well-designed and will not disconnect and fall off. The bracelet came in a classy cloth decorative bag that would be perfect if you give this for a gift.  The material is hypoallergenic if that is of important to you.  Finally, the seller offer a 100 day money back guarantee so you can't really go wrong.  Overall, I highly recommend this product. It is of excellent quality and I like everything but the size."
5.0,"Gone are the days of jamming my baseball cap into a large soda cup!<br /><br />Something so simple, but really is ideal for hat shaping.<br /><br />The adult size is sort of the standard bend, one of my new hats slid right in to it with no issues, so I'd call it perfect.<br /><br />You can use the smaller, youth size one to make the true redneck hat bend if you want... sometimes life calls for that."
5.0,I liked the size and the additional color of red on these glasses.
5.0,"La tela es muy muy suave, es caliente pero a la vez por ser de manga corta es fresca, muy bello el color se ajusta a la imagen"
5.0,"i love them, they have earned many compliments. im not big on flash and appreciate the quality of these earrings. comfortable and well made!"
5.0,"These bags are so strong.  They hold far move than an ordinary plastic bag from supermarket.  I use a car to bring in my grocery so the weight is no problem for me, otherwise I couldn't pack them so heavy.  I was beginning to have real guilt over the plastic bags I was using.  The is a learning curve on training the cashiers how to just put the bags where the plastic ones are."
5.0,So pretty.. love it
5.0,This was perfect! Grandchildren forgot pj's and I ordered these nightgowns because I thought they'd be nice and cool as it is very hot and they came the next day and fit beautifully and they loved them!
5.0,Love them they are super dark.
5.0,"Very cute, but are uncomfortable ti wear for long periods of walking"
5.0,very cool  top fits great
5.0,This watch an excellent buy. It's easy to set if you're familiar with digital watches. It has many features and settings. I have to set it for my husband who has neither  the experience nor patience. to do it himself.
5.0,I have these for a week now and they are great! I love the fit and the style! Super comfy and the quality is very good!
5.0,I really like these. They shine and are very pretty

5.0,"comfortable to wear, the vents help with fogging."
5.0,Also beautiful but too young looking for me once I tried the dress on.
5.0,I purchased the socks for mu grandson's birthday.  He loves them.
5.0,Love the color and material. True to color in picture. A bit smaller inside than what I needed but the extra pockets make it work.
5.0,I love it! Fits perfectly!
5.0,Beautiful colors and nice fit. I love these head wraps!
5.0,EXCELLENT PRODUCT
5.0,"This dress is gorgeous.  I feel like a queen in it!  The fabric is nice and drape-y.  The bodice fits nice and snug thanks to the lacing in the back of the dress (just like a corset).  I'm 5'5&#34; and weigh 198 lbs.  I normally wear a U.S. size 16 or 18 (depending on the article of clothing).  I'm a C cup.  I  purchased a size 16W in this dress.  The dress fits very nicely in the bust, torso,and waist.  It is the perfect length to wear with 3&#34; heels for me.  The bodice stays nicely in place.  One thing to be aware of is that the padded bra cups in the bodice are only attached at two points for each cup.  I will be tacking these in a little more solidly.  The elongated &#34;jewels&#34; on the bodice design have a tendency to flip over so the backside of the &#34;jewel&#34; is showing.  With a little extra stitching, I'll be able to eliminate the flipping.  I'll also probably tack down the embroidered applique a bit more just because I'm a bit of a klutz and will likely get an edge caught on something if I don't.  All in all, I'm tickled with the product!!!"
5.0,Nice product chain shine is brilliant. It's the second one I've bought.I would recommend ^_^
5.0,"My son LOVES this shirt! Fits as expected, color is as pictured, and it’s super comfy!"
5.0,It was OK...
5.0,This is a high quality pin that looks good to be proudly displayed on my cap or jacket
5.0,linda!!! Me encanta que se vea tan sencilla y moderna a la vez🥰
5.0,Quality belt. Looks very nice.<br />Great seller.
5.0,It’s such a great and light weight maxi skirt!  It goes with everything! You can dress it up with tank top and put a jean jacket over it<br />Or you can pick one color from skirt and buy a nice sweater or short sleeves top and wear it with the skirt!!
5.0,Super lightweight and very pretty! Pleasantly surprised at the quality.
5.0,"Buy it, you won't regret it"
5.0,Love love this item.<br />Lots of complements😍
5.0,Great value for the price. LGB!
5.0,Great quality shirt. Fits just right
5.0,Such a great outfit! Fits where it should! I love the open arms for when I have my private summers! LOL!
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter to wear to work and its great, she loves it and says it feels great while at work."
5.0,Cute slippers.  Bright colors and fir well.
5.0,I really sweat with I kickbox.  This comes off my head soaked !
5.0,It would be even better if the kanji was entirely shown instead of cut off to fit the pendant
5.0,Works as should
5.0,Nice gloves.  Fits as expected.  Make sure you measure for fit because they are not going to be loose.
5.0,It’s great only problem is you can’t carry a lot of cash
5.0,Awesome goggles
5.0,Good and sturdy
5.0,"At first I was skeptical because the order said it was already delivered 2-3 days ago, but it actually did arrive today on the original date the seller said it would. The sweater is of very decent quality considering the price and actually looks exactly like the same pattern in the picture. So based on the price and receiving the item, I give this product rating 5 stars."
5.0,"It is very hard to find larger sized coats. I buy a coat 2-3 sizes up from my clothing size so I can layer in the winter. I typically have 1 thermal top, a thin sweater and a hoodie under my coat to keep warm.  This particular coat is so warm I doubt I'll need all 3 layers to stay warm this year.  i was looking for a 3 in 1 jacket to replace my old one, but I am happier with this as it is just as warm without the bulk.  Also loved that the fur part of the hood zips off as it had been my only reservation to the purchase. Once I took it off I was much happier with the coat.  My only complaint is the breast tech pocket is cut a bit odd and my phone doesn't fit as well as it did with my last coat.  I used to be able to slide my phone in and have it settle into the pocket.  Now I have to maneuver it from horizontal to vertical once I put part of it in so it doesn't fall out unzipped or just to zip it ."
5.0,Great watch bands so I can change up my Apple Watch.
5.0,Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down! Not super thick but also not super thin! Will be buying more.
5.0,"This wallet is great. It's almost comically thin - they are serious when they say it is the thickness of a few sheets of paper. However, it holds a ton. There's room for 14 cards, 7 on each side. (Only 10 if the cards have raised lettering, like a credit card.) I haven't had more than 10 bills in it, but it has room for plenty more.<br /><br />I've only had it for a couple months, but so far it seems very durable. It's formed a bit to the shape of my credit cards, but otherwise there's no sign of any wear-and-tear."
5.0,Son loves it. Quality shirt. No complaints.
5.0,Bought as a gift for my nephew.  He loves it. Fits good and good quality and price.
5.0,So comfy and cute on- TY
5.0,"Finding the right swimsuit for a girl with my body is a challenge, to say in the least. This swimsuit is a miracle. I felt comfortable in as it didn't have any lose areas, and it wasn't too tight around my butt like other swimsuits I've owned. I didn't feel like I needed to cover up, and it's modest enough that I could wear it around my grandma."
5.0,Great charm. Great price.
5.0,"Initially I ordered the wrong lenses, my wife took a picture of my frames and they identified the style and exchanged the lenses immediately.<br />They fit perfectly, perform as promised, and would buy again."
5.0,Amazing Necklace! It came with a beautiful box and bag which makes it perfect for gifting. The Moissanite is clear and bright. It bought it as a gift for my friend and she loved it.
5.0,"I’m a pajama fan and this one is great. Fits as expected and well made. I don’t get too hot sleeping in this material, and it could be worn year round. This is the kind of pj I want to wear all day. I hate when I have to take it off and put on other clothes."
5.0,This headdress was beautiful and so glad that I purchased it
5.0,"Good looking purse, which serves the purpose for which it is intended. It is larger than I anticipated and a bit heavy, especially when fully loaded with necessities. So far it is holding up well and the quality of the leather is nice."
5.0,was amazed how well made it is.<br />Came on time and looked great with my clockwork orange costume. I might even wear it with my regular clothing. :D love it very  much ..was worth the buy.
5.0,Beautiful I got it as a gift for my boyfriend he loved it the quality is amazing the leather is soft it was just like I pictured it. It also fits well if you have a small wrist.
5.0,Bought for hubby for work. He loves it. Was bigger than I thought it was going to be but it's prefect.
5.0,This is the cutest necklace for any cat lover! I got this for myself to put in my stocking and I love it even though I haven't worn it yet.
5.0,I Love them
5.0,Love the look and the colors pop.
5.0,This is my fav hat. So inexpensive and cooler because of the light coloring
5.0,"I love the length, which on me is knee length. The pockets on the side are big enough for my iPhone max and the weight of the the phone didn’t cause the shorts to fall down. Happy with this purchase!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:45e069bfea172220e372b2a537ea0944]] Just like the apple silicone. As pictured.
5.0,"These are so cute.<br />I got them for my 6 year old, and they're a little large, but still so adorable on!"
5.0,Not too dressy perfect for the workplace. I receive lots of comments. Very comfortable
5.0,"Love the hat, Love the color and delivered on time as promised!!!!! Excellent service!!"
5.0,Great think case and looks good on the phone.
5.0,"A very good deal for the price.  Lightweight and comfortable.  I ordered two, so I can have one while I toss the other one in the wash.  The Velcro band made for a good attachment.  I'll order another when I wear these out!"
5.0,I am thrilled with these neand6. I just lost 41 pounds and haven't worn jeans in decades!!!! I am over the moon 😊 happy
5.0,"Gave as a gift but was given a pair. So soft, comfy and just the right thickness. Love these socks"
5.0,"These are great. I ordered the Medium and they fit just as a medium should. The shirt fits great and has a very nice design. The pockets for the shirt are fairly deep, deep enough to keep paper and pens in them or whatever I may need. The pants were a tad bit long, but that's okay because I am on the short side anyways and I am used to pants being to long on me. The pants pockets are about the same as the pockets on the shirt, They are fairly deep and long enough to be able to carry anything I would need. This set was a really great set and I plan on purchasing more.<br /><br />&#34; I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.&#34;"
5.0,I love the feel of this dress. Very comfortable and looks expensive. I love to just wear it around the house. Then if I need to go somewhere real quick I just go. This dress is so verable you can use it for a beautiful house dress or put on fancy shoes and wear it to church or shopping etc.
5.0,This works just like it says. Took all the tarnish right off all my sterling silver jewelry and polished it so shiny!! They all look brand new. Thanks a lot
5.0,wonderfully made and are so nice and soft.
5.0,This shirt is so cute I just love it not too big not too small so glad I saw it and ordered it thank you
5.0,I needed a bag to take my dry cleaning to the cleaners.  The bag has a nice appearance for its purpose and is sturdy enough to handle larger loads when necessary.  It seems extremely well constructed.  Looks perfect for a reasonable price.
5.0,Love for work
5.0,so soft just like lulu!
5.0,"Cute, and very adjustable. Good price and selection, if you're trying to beef up your septum clip-on numbers."
5.0,I’m 5’9 130 pounds and a small fit perfect. They are very comfortable and fit nicely. I was hesitant to order because I was afraid they would be scratchy or not fit but they are perfect.
5.0,I wear them to work as a security guard and they are very comfortable. Now that the weather is getting nicer i will set them aside as they really keep my legs warm and I won't need that benefit.
5.0,Very nice pin.
5.0,These cargo shorts are just what I need.
5.0,I love this. Its very pretty.
5.0,"My husband's review - With Summer coming up, I got myself a pair of these swimming trunks. They're a perfect fit around my waste with its adjustable size and they're comfortable. I've had issues where the insides of some swimming trunks rub against my skin and give me a rash, and I have not yet had that problem with these. If you're lucky enough to have a swimming pool during this quarantine, then these swimming trunks might be your best bet!"
5.0,"Excellent shoes very comfortable and light , you can walk hours and hours with them"
5.0,"Plush, and thickly knitted.  I felt the comfort the minute I put them on."
5.0,Great for the price. Long live Hyrule.
5.0,"I was so tired of cracking my eggs when i was collecting, so happy to find this!  Great material forcleaning, holds even the bigger eggs.  Love this, and for the price, I couldnt make it myself.  Highly recommend!"
5.0,Excellent shoe laces.  I like switching up my shoe laces to match the shorts I'm wearing.  These shoe laces are great.
5.0,My husband got this watch 3 years ago and wore it till the rubber in the band started cracking. Went shopping for a new one and he picked this one again.
5.0,"Love the color, bought one for a friend for her daughter, I have a light blue one."
5.0,"I bought this last minute for our trip to Maui. This dress fit beautifully. It didn't wrinkle during travel either! I am 5'10 and 150 pds and curvy/hourglass, I ordered a large and it fit perfectly. The length was just at the top of my knee. It does show quite a bit of cleavage, depending on how you wrap it. I pinned the overlap at the bodice to keep it from adjusting itself lol."
5.0,"love these boots. This is probably the 3rd pair I've ordered from Anderson Bean, and they all have been high quality, well made, long lasting boots."
5.0,Just the right accessory I needed to top off my football outfit love it thank you
5.0,A lot of ring for the price.
5.0,"I love these shoes.  One shoe string was longer than the other,  but that's a small fix."
5.0,One fantastic looking watch looks even better once you see it! Perfect size shape & weight! Always stays accurate! Water resistant solar powered looks great no matter if your dressed up or dressed casual its all good!
5.0,Loved the price. Very comfortable and I am always loosing my glasses so now I have enough glasses hahaha. Problem solved.
5.0,Fit as expected and look great
5.0,Good way for my daughters support team to spread the message about brain cancer/tumor awareness
5.0,"Feels amazing, much more luxurious than your average nato and up there in quality with ones that have come with some of my higher end watches (e.g. Rado).<br /><br />I'm a little worried about the holes growing with use, but hopefully it holds up. If so, it's a great buy."
5.0,Love it! I get lots of compliment so i bought the green color too.
5.0,"bought this as an addon item with another product, so it's a deal you can't beat elsewhere.<br />good display contrast, better than in the pictures you see online.<br />i'm taking this to the beach, and won't be one bit worried about it.<br />happy with this purchase."
5.0,Fits perfect I'm 5'1 120 lbs and small exactly fits right to me . I usually small medium but I got the small size.
5.0,Very cute and warm beanie hat
5.0,"Dress was very nice, but was to large and I returned it."
5.0,"This is the perfect shoe for my little one, I'm glad I brought 3 pair of them. Great price shipped fast."
5.0,"I love this shirt.  I actually bought a second in another color.  It fits great.  However, it's not cropped per se.  If you are looking for your belly button to be on display, this may not be the shirt for you unless you have a long torso.  I believe my torso is average size and the shirt sits just below my belly button and above my hips.  It's short enough to let a little cool air in :-).  The design in the back adds interest.  It could easily be worn as a casual shirt or a workout shirt."
5.0,I ordered these because they are purple. Will wear them while watching LSU football!
5.0,This is better than I thought it would be and I'm thrilled!
5.0,"This is my son's second pair of these board shorts. The first lasted through 2 years of constant lake, ocean and pool fun in the sun, until he outgrew them. New pair quality is the same, so glad they still offer this style. He's very slim and the ties are tight enough, which can be hard to find in older boys' trunks. He's too slim for adult ones."
5.0,Quality frames.
5.0,Amazing quality and amazing price!
5.0,"I love the dragonfly, and have gotten many compliments on this scarf, already!"
5.0,"I had no experience using this product so I watched a utube video and shapped 2 hats myself. They look great. The product arrived when expected,  great packaging and a wonderful product."
5.0,It's so pretty. Not meant for everyday use.  I'll buy in other colors if it was available.
5.0,"This thing is awesome and a great trick to avoid checking in bags at the airport until you actually need them on the return trip. The 80L is plenty large, and i typically use it to hold dirty clothes from the trip as i wouldnt want to put fragile items in there. Folds up neatly and takes up as much space as say 2-3 shirts stacked on top of each other."
5.0,Guys loved them
5.0,I love those long shorts.
5.0,Good product fits great 'good colors and arrived on time
5.0,"I love these earrings. I’ve always been a peacock feather wearer and had a pair from Forever 21 from 2008 that I adored. I lost both earrings over time and I have been looking for a suitable replacement ever since. These are wonderful.<br /><br />They are elegant and I can literally wear them with anything which is why I wear them almost every day!<br /><br />One complaint (and literally the only complaint) is that because of their length and the length of the decorative metal piece, they do crowd my ears when I’m wearing something with a thick collar or a scarf. They don’t have any “hinged” movement like they would if they were on The end of multiple smaller beads. I have to adjust them a lot when I have a collar or scarf because I’m worried they will be weakened by the tension that occurs sometimes when they are crowded like that. I hope that makes sense!<br /><br />Other than that these are amazing not just for the price but for the quality and detail. I love them and almost want a second pair as a back up just in case I lose them again!"
5.0,Love this however my daughter ended up taking it to wear and I haven’t gotten it back so I’ll be ordering another one for myself!
5.0,Good quality with no fraying.
5.0,Was given as a gift which they loved it but the chain broke fairly quickly.
5.0,Cute and elegant. Thank you!
5.0,Beautiful!!!!!!!!!
5.0,"Arrived earlier than expected, good quality, very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"My husband likes the product, the feel, the comfort and the fit..."
5.0,Perfect for a quick santa change.. 😂
5.0,Love these joggers!! Super cute and comfy
5.0,beautiful 👍
5.0,The hat fits great - and I have a BIG head with lots of curly hair. The funny thing is that my kids think the hat looks huge because they are so used to seeing me stuff myself into a regular hat (which would give me headaches). I only with this hat came in more fun colors.
5.0,"If you're usually a medium, size up for a slightly loose fit."
5.0,Built well. Same price as the junk ones sold at walmart for a much better product!
5.0,I really love these glasses.  They look great and the transition works great.
5.0,"Yikes! Got it quick and, man, it even looks better LIVE! Brilliant colors, with Mr. Zombie lookin' real evil. Got it fast, fits good, looks great, can't ask for much more than that."
5.0,"I thought they might have been higger, but they are very pretty. I love love the ones with the diamond stud on them. Definitely my favorite."
5.0,Great shoes. I'm gonna buy more for my other boys. They were originally for there dad but one of our boys took over them.
5.0,"I recently started shooting and wanted to make sure my ears were going to stay healthy.  I read the reviews on this set of muffs and after researching others, decided to go choose these.  I've used them a couple times already and I think they are doing a great job.  They are comfortable and seal well, so I feel protected even when loud weapons are being fired. Recommended purchase."
5.0,My daughter loves these boots.  Most boots are $100+.  These are great for daily wear.  They have scuffed a little but still a great buy.
5.0,Bought for Christmas gifts and absolutely beautiful.
5.0,I have two pairs of these and I love how nice they look and feel. These are like a cheaper version of Lululemon's.<br />I wear a medium and wish they had more colors to offer in my size. I like black camo and they don’t have that available. Maybe down the road they will
5.0,Love the soft hand as well as functionality.
5.0,"Love,  love, love!  So comfy and true to size!"
5.0,Beautiful butterfly mask❗ Bought as a gift and she loves it❗The  colors are gorgeous ❗Arrived super fast❗  Just as said it would be❗
5.0,Beautiful bag and came with a dust bag as well.  Before this purchase I researched many bags that were much more expensive and not as nice as the one I received.  I would highly recommend-lots of compartments and my laptop fits perfect with lots of room for files and accessories.
5.0,"Warm and cute, fits well."
5.0,"Bought the 11-13 size for my 10 year old daughter (she's a solid size 12 normally).  Fits just slightly big, so it will fit next winter as well. She LOVED it!  Same wolf design is on front and back.  Good medium thickness. Material has more of a slick feel, but we like it. Not a warm and cozy sweatshirt, but if your child loves wolves then you can't go wrong!"
5.0,This thing is a classic! Stripped down to the most basic functions. Survives my daily shower with no problem. Wish the internal LED was a little better but dude...it's 9 bucks. Buy one.
5.0,"I love these glasses! The red is really cool, chic & flattering! They are VERY sturdy & well-made. Like the tortoise she'll too. There's something for everyone's taste. I know I'll wear every pair. They grey is really nice, sort of a transparent grey-blue which is beautiful. Then there's the standard black, which you pull off & look so very good lol.<br />I highly recommend the case. It's really well made, has a cleaning cloth & is very versatile, attractive & sufficient to protect a pair carried in the depths of my purse. It is black with a large band of red down the top. Of course there are different colors available, but I'm very apply with the red & would buy it again & recommend it highly. I love that I could get the coke bottles that I need to read 5.0 & they don't look like coke bottles. All in all a solid hit. Love the. Oh the lenses are very clear, like crystal. Love love love!"
5.0,"I bought these for myself, and found them to be the best pair of gloves I have ever owned. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND A GREAT VALUE!!"
5.0,GF loved it
5.0,"This is a lovely dress. I liked it. I thought it was flattering. I thought the fit was pretty good. I thought that it was unique and looked good.<br /><br />The dress was relatively comfortable. The fit was okay. It wasn't too hot, which for me is important since we live in Florida.<br /><br />It wasn't too hard to clean. I thought it seemed trendy. It felt durable and the fabric was relatively soft. It would work in a wide variety of settings.<br /><br />It was as described and I would recommend it."
5.0,Very cute and well made. I love that it is sizeable!
5.0,"I love my new sun glasses, they exceeded my expectations! I'm going to order a second pair to keep in my car.<br />I highly recommend these!"

5.0,"Fits as expected, extremely comfortable, love the pockets!"
5.0,"Good house shoe, has Velcro straps on each side so makes it easy to adjust size. Has 2 sole inserts."

5.0,All good will buy again in the future.
5.0,fantastic!
5.0,These are great masks.
5.0,Best value and watch ever.
5.0,"They make me sexy, I like them"
5.0,Was really appreciated and well made
5.0,"I am a 73 y o woman with very small feet and yes, these shoes fit perfectly."
5.0,"I really like this dress i first got an x-large  and I sent it back and got a large for my daughter  we are going to keep the large. But we could have gotten by with the medium, this dress run on the  bigger  side."
5.0,It’s was really cute!! I do think the size fits as expected!! But just for me personally it was a little tight. I’m 5 foot and 130 pounds.
5.0,I wear the silver one everyday love it
5.0,Perfect for my wedding rehearsal!
5.0,These socks were a godsend as we flew 14 hours to Italy! They weren't too tight but snug enough to assist in circulation. I highly recommend them!
5.0,These earrings are lovely and not heavy on the lobes. Gave them as a gift and she loved them.
5.0,tnx
5.0,I got this for a Christmas gift and it was loved.  Nice weight and easy opening of the pin.  Seems like it would hold up good over time with normal use.
5.0,Arrived in one day....It was easy to put on the watch and is soft and cute matches the watch face...I am going to order another one.
5.0,Bought this for my 70+ year old mom because she struggled to fasten the different type watch bands on the fitbits.  She LOVES it. Says she doesn't even have to think about it now because it's so comfortable along with super easy to put on.
5.0,I was pleasantly surprised that this shirt fit so well and was flattering even on my large bust. I love a crisp white shirt and this is a step up from a plain tee shirt. It a great versatile option for the summer!
5.0,Good quality hat
5.0,"My mom loves wine and so when I came across this, I thought it was a great stocking stuffer, and it was! It was a funny surprise but also very useful. They are soft and cozy. It's a great gift for someone who loves wine and is in on the joke as well. Definitely get this for the wine lover in your life."
5.0,"I originally bought these at Costco and LOVED THEM but sadly Costco didn’t bring them back this summer. I opted to buy them on Amazon but received the incorrect size so that sucked. However, the shoe itself is so comfortable and to break them in it takes little effort. I used them for gardening which wasn’t the best idea because I wore them out but I would still highly recommend. Assuming the person in charge of shipping sends the correct size."
5.0,I recommend it is very good beautiful I loved beautiful bag good quality
5.0,Perfect size and insulated for our hot climate.
5.0,I LOVE LOVE LOVE these tanks for running. I now have 6 in different colors and they fit perfectly and also stay down as I am running (great length - covers hips and most of rear end). I cannot stand constantly tugging at my running clothes and these are a great affordable option that washes well and stands up to my VERY sweaty workouts. Very happy customer!
5.0,Fix's great
5.0,"I havent wore this out of the home yet but tmr a few appts and i will be wearing, it is such a pretty green love the rose gold it is perfect"
5.0,Overall outstanding
5.0,Perfect. Absolutely lovely.
5.0,"I don't wear earrings often, so if you're like me, you may have some trouble getting these in originally. They don't have a sharp tip on the post and the post is a little thicker than usual. Both of these things are understandable, as it helps the earrings stay in place and it doesn't poke the back of your ear.<br /><br />They look great and are very sturdy. I bent the post out a bit to get them in to position more easily. The post bent back with no problem and no damage done. Very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />I also have sensitive ears and I had no issues after wearing these for multiple days."
5.0,Very pleased.  It doesn't ride up and prevents chafing.
5.0,"I bought the brown cardigan and I wasn’t sure if it would look like the picture but it does!!! I’m very happy with it, this was a Christmas gift.I bought an XL and it fits perfectly!!"

5.0,The product was delivered quickly and was exactly as I had hoped for color wise.
5.0,Lightweight and well made. I would buy this again when my little guy grows out of the size I bought.
5.0,Just a beautiful adddition to my bracelet
5.0,"I got these glasses because I have a terrible time sleeping, and I heard that the yellow glasses helped in that regard.  I put them o for several hours in the evening, and I have had much better sleep.  They fit very well and don' slip around.  They are very nice looking.  I have no complaints.  Thank you for having such a good product."
5.0,"Loooooooooooove these tights!!!! Got the green (forest, I believe) and they're beautiful.  My third pair of this brand, will be buying more. So soft and comfortable,  high-waisted in the right way, and they don't roll down at the waist! Just buy these...you won't be disappointed!"
5.0,"As soon as I received it, loved it and immediately put all my keys on it."
5.0,Squat proof color and comfort is amazing! Not extremely moisture wicking but does help somewhat. I do sweat a lot when working out.
5.0,"Lots and lots of playtime fun for the wife.  She loves these, and even made a display holder for these masks ;)"
5.0,"Received this cute bag in just 2 days. It's perfect for game day, just the right size and well made. Nice zipper closure and adjustable strap. Logo is printed on attractive canvas type material. Go Gators!"
5.0,Best stuff
5.0,Great pair of slippers.  Really love them.
5.0,"Fantastic value. Comparable merino wool tops sell at REI for $70 or $80. Very soft...not like cotton obviously but a good quality merino. I am 6'2 175#, ordered the large and it fits perfect. Plenty of length to tuck into pants and stay put. Has some stretch to it too. LOVE that it was only $20!!!"
5.0,Makes t shirt look neater
5.0,Cute and simple. Good deal for price
5.0,Perfect for the gym or dorm shower
5.0,"I've purchased these for my children since they were little. Major time saver! No more bending over to tie shoes again, these are a MUST have"
5.0,Perfect for the gym
5.0,"This is adorable. For reference, my leather crossbody is 9 x 7 inches ."
5.0,"The quality of the fabric is really good, doesn't even need pressing. I ordered a bigger size because the reviews said it runs small but ended up getting it altered by a local tailor. It fits well and looks great."
5.0,love it use it everyday!!
5.0,"Totally happy,right length,high quality."
5.0,Super cute! A great alternative to the $$$ ones made by that French chocaliteir. Came in a lovely Purple heart-shaped box. Bought for my niece as a stocking stuffer and I know she’ll love it. Arrived in time for Christmas!
5.0,Timely delivery. Product is as advertised.
5.0,Put these on each side of my Heart Stents charm and it definitely calls attention to that.
5.0,Cute fitted top. Love the color. Not too heavy.
5.0,Cute. Perfect for my 6 year old who has sensitive ears.
5.0,Cute set. The mask broke immediately but that's not why I bought it so that's okay. Lol. Print is adorable and it's held up through a couple of washes so far.
5.0,Good I like 👍it
5.0,I wore the shirt yesterday and and a Vietnam Vet came up to me and thanked me for not forgetting his friends. I thanked him and gave him a hug.
5.0,"Color is deep and consistent. Fit perfectly, soft and comfortable. I'm short and was concerned about the knee area fitting properly, but was no problem . Will probably fit cropped like if your tall. I would recommend this outfit. Great price!"
5.0,"Quick delivery, nice fit, got one size larger to wear over a t shirt. Would buy again"
5.0,"This dress is very flattering. I'm 5'2&#34; and a little on the chunkier side. I'm normally a size 16, with broad shoulders and thicker arms.. so I struggle to find shirts/dresses that aren't too tight. I ordered an XL in black and this fit perfectly.. very flowy. I'm not worried about the length because I just tied a knot anyways. It's not a cotton material, it's more stretchy like spandex, but not tight like spandex."
5.0,fit as expected!
5.0,Fits my 11-15 year old great!
5.0,Looks exactly like the pic. shiny and really cute!
5.0,Perfect for my 2 year old
5.0,I got this for my niece and she loves it
5.0,Super. Lo que buscaba
5.0,Looks very good. However I was unable to connect it to my PS4 system so I just ended up using it as a keychain instead. Works great as a keychain.
5.0,I wore this jacket once and it fit very well. I elected for the xl like others suggested.
5.0,It is great quality definitely recommend getting this for your child!
5.0,"Bought  for my daughter for Christmas. she loves them, looks smart, keeps her feet warm. She wore out her last pair of Bearpaws, I believe those were the Lauren style. It took 2-3 years... We live in Montana and she wears them everyday from the first day of snow until spring, when she trades them for her cowboy boots."
5.0,"They are beautiful, well made and elegant in their simplicity. I have always leaned toward the less is more philosophy, so these absolutely meet that criteria. They sparkle when the lights hit them just right but even in dim light they are brilliant."
5.0,I love them.  Just waiting for Cyber Monday to buy more.  Friends tried mine and they are also planning to buy.
5.0,The product is just as described and arrived very quickly.  I would highly recommend this product!
5.0,❤
5.0,Comfortable and airy.
5.0,Bought these for a Easter basket and they were the biggest hit of the whole basket
5.0,Bellos y cómodos
5.0,Trendy and Great quality
5.0,"Great value item.  Works as described.  My old tradition card holder was a mess.  This is so much easier to use.  The money clip on my old card holder never got used, this concept is much more functional."
5.0,My 3 years old son broke a total of 3 glasses in less then a year after order these frames I must say that I love it.
5.0,"I've had two pair of these in my life, and contemplating buying a 3rd right now for this winter. They are a bit oversized (for large wool-type socks, or wool-blends), so drop a half-size if you aren't planning on -20F winters, or long stints outside...and intend to use 'normal socks' instead of double-thickness wool blend socks. Also, these are almost SOLID vulcanized rubber on the outside...so 'fix and repair' should be thought of as 'car tire inner-tube repair', more than 'shoe repair'...(although they don't put the 'good stuff' in Shoe Goo anymore that will actually 'fix them' correctly...most methyl ethyl butyl ether compounds are illegal now...so you MAY have to hunt down a cobbler that can still repair such shoes properly (say, around military bases in front-gate communities). They DO have some issues...mostly design-related, due to the vulcanized rubber...like quick heel wear-down, and even 'heel loss' if they are 'rebuilds' where the heel was ground off and then 're-glued' to repair it. A good 'rasp file' and some true 'vulcanizing cement' (where you have to burn off the volatiles before applying part a to part b) will reinstall 'dropped heels' pretty quickly. Again, it's 'patching inner tubes' more than repairing shoes, with these boots.  NEVER EVER GET WATER into the 'inner core' of the shoes through the bleed valve! If you do, you'll NEVER get them dry inside the 'encapsulated wool filler' again...we used to tape over the valves unless you were flying...so no water got in! If water gets in them, it nullifies the insulation almost completely.<br />Overall, some of the best boots ever made for the arctic (actually, used with the Minuteman Missile system program originally)...and North Dakota can get down to -40F to -50F in the dead of winter, too! Cotton socks over heavy wool socks over thin polyester socks...and then these boots...and you could walk around in your N-3B parka all day and stay RELATIVELY WARM...guaranteed!"
5.0,"Todo muy bien bonito y elegante producto, lindo envoltorio."
5.0,Perfect size and are really cute
5.0,This shoe is a gorgeous shoe and fits perfectly!!!
5.0,"If you are like me and thought it would be a lot easier to buy bandanas on Amazon only to find negative reviews, counterfeits under name brands, undersized or different fabrics...THESE bandanas are are absolutely what you are looking for. They have a high rating for a reason. What they describe is absolutely what you get and I couldn't be happier. I've almost gotten used to being underwhelmed with online ordering like fast food where the thing they advertise is nothing like what they try to give you. But nah this little purchase is quality."
5.0,I've it!
5.0,"This stuff is magic. Regularly use to clean my Jordan’s from suede to leather, best product on the market"
5.0,"This is an adorable skirt with a bit of stretch. I have ordered several more. The image is clear, the colors are bright, the material is forgiving and comfortable."
5.0,"Great fabric, good fit and great quality!"
5.0,"Nice hat, would buy again"
5.0,My daughter loved this. I hung it in the closet and hung her doll's robe next to it and she was over the moon. I soft and fit her age perfectly fine
5.0,"Daughter is a cheerleader and is a base/spotter, she loved them."
5.0,My son really loves his face mask the only issue we are having or had is that they are a little tight around his neck.
5.0,"Yes, they are expensive, but what is that compared to a lifetime of comfort and clarity. They are watertight with the headband adjusted to  minimum tension - what comfort! They ever fog up, always clear vision. And their support is the best.<br />One caveat: the instructions say ""do not touch the insides"" The inside has a special anti-fog coating that is delicate. Just rinse them off when finished and put them in the special case provided to dry."
5.0,Gift for my wife. She likes it. Points for me! Happy wife means happy life.
5.0,"This is a nice dupatta.  The pattern flows like the slightly transparent fabric, and the large silver sequents are like little mirrors that sparkle.  When the silver beads are layered under the fabric, you can see them sparkle.  The addition of the silver beads and shell trim is interesting.  I have never seen that before.  It is a cat magnet.  I think if I had turned my back, my cat would have climbed it.  The dupatta is kind of like a cat collar with a bell on it.  When you walk around, it jingles.  It makes me think of the song ""Lal Dupatta."""
5.0,The black polka dot one is cute. Adjustable and fits perfectly. Great for covering your face from the sun while driving on a sunny day!
5.0,It is the perfect compact size to use in a camera bag. Well made and the perfect minimalist wallet. Perfect for use at a vacation resort.
5.0,"Perfect fit. I'm 5'3&#34;- 5'4&#34; and 95 pounds. Goes up a bit past mid-thigh for me. Stays up pretty well.<br />Tip: if yout afraid of your nails catching when you put it on, put socks over your hands."
5.0,Love this! Fits great! True to size! Great Material! What more can I say??
5.0,Fits well and very comfortable. Material is also of high quality
5.0,For the money it was great!
5.0,We bought these to try out because my boyfriend and I both have problems with lights glaring at night time. He tried these out and they were super helpful for driving at night. He is keeping a pair in his car and I'm going to buy another pair to put in mine!
5.0,I got these socks for an airplane trip and they have been great!  They kept my legs from swelling and were comfortable doing it. I would highly recommend them for anyone with vascular issues or just to keep you comfortable.
5.0,Compact yet functional
5.0,Love the color and quality. Very happy.
5.0,These are the best shoes I have ever purchased for use with AFO's.  Getting my son's shoes on and off are now a breeze!
5.0,I used it on my new sneakers & my everyday loafers.  Haven’t been out in raining weather but expecting that this week.
5.0,"Its the perfect size especially if you have two ear lobe piercing and are looking for something cute to put in the second one. I have no complaints, good size, cute, nice color. Its a steal for that price."
5.0,Love the material - soft and comfortable.  Small enough to fit both of my 5 y/o and 3 y/o
5.0,"True to size. I expected them to stretch my ears a little just from the design but fit snug and stay in place. Mine are 5/8"" but these make the hole look gigantic. Over all, satisfied. Really like the way they look worn."
5.0,Love this purse. It is very well made and durable. I have gotten a lot of complements about it.
5.0,Beautiful and Soft
5.0,This was a perfect gift for my &#34;Tool Time&#34; lovibg hubby!
5.0,"I haven't taken these to the gym yet, but since was I was having a hard time trying to size these given the description and size chart i thought I would offer my review after trying them on. For reference, I'm a pudgy large in most dept. store sizes. I fit comfortably into the Target/Champion C9 5&#34; Running shorts in LG; I wear a large FTL boxer briefs and L in Adidas performance underwear (pictured). I found the these Desmiit shorts in XXL to fit perfectly. Not snug at all. Not too big. Just enough stretch. I have full mobility for stretching, etc., so i don't anticipate any issues. I recommend doing just as it says, order 2 sizes up.<br />***UPDATE: I took these to the gym this morning. These worked out great. I wear my mid-thigh performance boxer-briefs underneath. I had absolutely no issues with movement restriction. They wear very light. They stayed in place pretty much perfectly. The gray ones did show sweat more readily than my running shorts but actually seemed to dry out a bit faster. Oh, and the pockets were big enough for me to hold my phone (Samsung s5 in Otterbox) and my 10 oz water bottle while I wiped down machines. Definite hearty thumbs up."
5.0,I bought it for my Seiko Baby Tuna. I also replaced its original hardlex crystal to a double dome sapphire one with blue reflection!!!!!!! Now is a tool watch!!!!
5.0,Good quality/great price
5.0,OK I HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING SO I PUT SOMETHING
5.0,"I love this dress! Pattern, fit and material are perfect. I got a large and that is what I normally wear. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,they're just the right size for me and very pretty
5.0,This bracelet is everything I thought it would be and MORE!  The sparkle is amazing and the stones look genuine.  The clasp functions properly and the gold finish is very realistic.  I look forward to finding more great values!
5.0,"There have been negative reviews, but this watch winder works great.  I gave it to my husband as a gift in April 2014 for a Rolex.  We have had no problems with the watch winder."
5.0,"Purrrrfect for my Cat Woman photo shoot! Very simple, stayed in place, and looked great!"
5.0,Love it perfect fit
5.0,It is too fun to wear !
5.0,Love these comfy sandals.!!! Awesome choice.
5.0,I live this shirt. I wasn’t sure about getting it at first bc I am not one for long shirts. This one hits just about right and sized as expected. Nice shirt for the price. Color looks better in person as well
5.0,Beautiful set!  Love it!!
5.0,"This shirt runs a little on the smaller-side.  Not too much, but if you normally wear between XL & XXL. Definitively get the XXL."
5.0,Had to buy a second pair for her to wear.  The other pair is on display.
5.0,Yoga pants are very comfortable and fit true to size. I would order more in the future!
5.0,Not bad for the price and I received some compliments on it.  Washes well without pilling.  Does not need ironing.
5.0,"These are so cute, very flexible and lightweight. The rubbery sole is extremely grippy, and has a rainbow pattern which is a nice touch. The sole is thin on these, which I think is a plus. Your child can feel some of the texture of what they are walking on. They run a little bit big and a little wide."
5.0,"There is absolutely nothing negative to say about this amazing belt...PERIOD!!  Literally for $10 this belt is 100% PERFECT in every way possible.  Sizing was dead on, width was thick enough so it wasn't in question as if its a mens or womans belt but not crazy thick to where its hard to loop thru the jeans, the buckle was also dead on in size and wasn't super tiny like a lot of other belts that are attempting to portray a certain very expensive designer belt.  I highly recommend this belt to anyone who is in need of a suttle leather belt with a very nice and modest buckle.  Doesn't look like you were out of pocket trying to front like you can afford some crazy designer belt from Italy or something.  I wouldn't  be suprised if this belt had better materials anyway so go for it you wont be upset.  I got the silver/black one & received it in a very stricktly packaged manner ensuring the integrity and well being of the belt.  Also came with a blue dust bag.  10-10 Perfect."
5.0,Love all three of these turtlenecks.
5.0,"Loveee these dresses once I tried it on I felt in love right away, and ordered 2 more colors. Its w great dress and very comfortable. I am 5’8 and 155lbs and I ordered Large"
5.0,"I mean, they're cute in the picture, but they look even nicer in person! I actually only wanted one of them, but they're all very beautiful! Comfortable too! Highly recommend - especially at that price! ;)"
5.0,Had no issues using it and worked as expected!
5.0,"These pants have lot of great qualities about them: the waist band has grippy material that keeps them from sliding, the button has a slide and lock design, there are extra pockets (but I dont think I would considered them cargo), the material is comfortable, lightweight, stretchy, and water proof, and seems like it will be able to clean as well."
5.0,THESE SHADES PUT ALL OTHER SUNGLASSES TO SHAME! BEST IN THE WORLD! HANDS DOWN
5.0,Perfect fit! I have one for my daughter and loved it so a year later bought this for my newborn son
5.0,"I LOVE THESE! I bought two pairs of these for my first and third holes in my ears, beautiful! they've been on for about a week now and haven't came out yet, I feel like these will never come off. IM IN LOVE! thank you so much !!"
5.0,These silicone charms looks just like the picture and feel &#34;normal&#34;. They haven't reduced the thickness nor the quality. Glad to have them.
5.0,"I am the wife. I bought these shoes for my 3 mile walks. These are perfect. I was surprised at how comfortable they were. I accidentally spilled something on them, and to clean them, I threw them in my dishwasher.. and it worked! The sides are vinyl. The only leather parts are the toe and tongue, but that doesn't matter to me. This is the second pair I have bought. The only bad thing is they stopped carrying half sizes, but I fixed that by putting in a thicker shoe insert. Also the skulls have not worn off."
5.0,"These are great sunglasses for the price point and seem to be holding up well. Very similar to other, more expensive options."
5.0,"There are so many little slots for cards, also enough room to hold your phone next to your dollar bills and it is super cute too.  I love this wallet & highly recommend if you are like me and don't always like carrying around a big purse."
5.0,I can't tell you how many compliments I have gotten wearing these boots out. Awesome and so dang flashy for my Nashville trip.  Definitely need boots there.  Or you can't go. Haha
5.0,"I've had this water bottle for over a year now, and use it nightly in the wintertime. I place it underneath the covers and let it heat the bed before I hop in, and it feels amazing!!  This is a very high-quality water bottle with a smooth, tight seal. It is ribbed on both sides.  The rubber is thick and does not have a rubber/chemical scent at all.  I put very hot water from the faucet in the bottle. It heats slowly and is maximum temperature within about 4 minutes. I like the fact that it will not burn your skin because of the way it is designed (thick rubber, ribbed on both sides). I was once burned by a low quality, inexpensive hot water bottle and it was not fun.  I'm glad I invested in this one and expect it to last for years.  I hope you enjoy it as well!"
5.0,Perfect halloween detail
5.0,This dress fits like it was made for me I absolutely love it . I’m 5’9 and the dress touches the floor .
5.0,Looks awesome only thing you need to wear strapless bra or matching bra because it's completely see through ! Seems to run true to size to a bit larger!
5.0,I was looking for a pair of blue earrings and a pair of green too.  I hit the jackpot with these. Comfortable to wear and not too heavy. They look just as pictured.
5.0,"I love my new skirt, it's looks pretty well made, and its really comfortable. Shipping was quicker than expected."
5.0,The Devin Rose earrings are very delicate and I love the beautiful design.
5.0,Great feel and fits like a glove.
5.0,"Exactly what we needed.  I can leave it in the back of the SUV and it doesn't take up much space.  When we get fresh food; typically seafood, we can quickly put it in the cooler."
5.0,"Love them! Very comfortable. I’m a big fan of Friends, was very excited to receive my slippers."
5.0,Great product. Had to use for a school play.
5.0,"I hang things around my neck--like knives, compass, whistle, etc--usually with paracord.  Strong as it is, paracord could strangle me if I caught it on something so I insert these crummy little D-clips into the deal because they will break instead of my neck.  I make a loop in each end of the paracord and clip the ends together with these D-clips. The somewhat weak nature of these clips is just what you want here."
5.0,Love love love the colors and the way it snaps on. Different from Apple bands and I love it! I ended up mix-matching my bands together and it looks amazing
5.0,Love it! It is beautiful
5.0,"PERFECT FOR TRAVEL WITH COMPUTER, WILL BE WONDERFUL!!!!"
5.0,"My daughter looks so cute in these skorts!  She plays tennis and needed them with pockets for tennis balls.  These fit the bill.  Sassy, short and “as comfortable as shorts!”"
5.0,Great colors Very Cute Feel Good to Wear
5.0,Great fabric! Washes so well. Very well constructed.
5.0,"I have it in rose gold, i had to get the blue one!"
5.0,It even had me do a double take
5.0,Seems durable. Wish it had more defined pockets but you are able to store a large amount of items.
5.0,The quality is good
5.0,It’s a beautiful jumpsuit and well made but runs a bit small
5.0,Worth the buy ladies
5.0,"I am absolutely in love with this bag. Truth be told, minutes after I placed my order I regretted it, thinking the bag would be bigger than I liked. I didn't cancel anyway, thought that if I really didn't like it I could gift it to my sister who likes bigger bags. I was very pleasantly surprised when I received it because it is exactly the size that I wanted. I can fit my usual stuff perfectly without carrying a very bulky bag. I usually carry my wallet, phone, a medium size makeup bag, my tablet, a book, sunglasses, reading glasses, keys, a notepad and some pens. It all fits great. There are 2 main compartments with a a zippered one in between, another smaller zippered spot and a couple of pouches where I usually put my glasses. I love it. I was pleased to find a cute keychain inside with a thank you note!!"
5.0,Esroy satisfecho
5.0,"Super soft, beautiful color, looks exactly as pictured! Nice and oversized but not ridiculously big. I want all the colors!"
5.0,I have been wanting to get a rose gold pentacle necklace for sometime and I stumbled across this one. It is beautiful and also resembles the anti-possession tattoo from Supernatural which is just a plus for me! The chain is dainty and may not work for everyone. You could easily swap out for a different chain or choker.
5.0,Great toilet bag. My mum loves it
5.0,"I was looking for charms to use for charm casting. After researching, I discovered these. They are as beautiful as depicted in the photos...nice selection and great variation. I did order multiple packages and found that there were many variations on the same type of item (I found 8-10 different butterflies in one pack). Each package had similar items, but it was a nice surprise to find those variations.  Ordered these in both gold and silver and am really happy with this product. I would highly recommend them...Thank you!!!"
5.0,Very nice fit.  I love the dress!
5.0,"I usually wear a 34 DD, but since this bra only comes in D cup sizes I figured I go with a 38 D to make it fit in the cups. The band is surprisingly tighter than I expected, I will still need to sow it a bit to make it perfect. I also ordered a 36 D but the cup size was too small, although the band was perfect. I have major problems finding bras, so I am glad I found this one even if I need to modify it a bit. After wearing it for most of he day I ordered another color already. It is very comfortable, and the down in pads as extra contour."
5.0,Works better then I thought it would! Holds everything I need and fits in front or back pocket no problem. Worth every bit. Better than any 20-50 dollar wallet at the store. Best part is the pull tab to pop the cards out!! Also tested the security and it works too!! Very good but!!!!
5.0,"Thanks. This is a great, well made, well priced Duty Belt. I had it adjusted to my size in a few minutes. The inner construction keeps my IWB holster and hand gun from drooping. I am Not law enforcement. So the belt only supports my holstered handgun and magazine pouches. Solid construction keeps me easily concealed as the law requires. I would recommend this Duty Belt, and this Seller again. And will buy other products from them. 5 stars in every category. Thanks again."
5.0,Beautiful. Would recommend crenalin slip
5.0,"This is a very nice navy and red striped tie.  Business professional look, to be worn with suit or just a shirt and navy slacks."
5.0,These shoes are the best.  Fit as expected.  Comfortable and didnt really have to break them in.  Would definitely buy again!
5.0,Love love love this sarong! It is so pretty! I cannot believe how inexpensive it was. I loved it so much that I am ordering one for my sister so she can take it on her honeymoon :)
5.0,Bag is just right size. Very nice during night outs
5.0,The most comfortable belt I've ever used. I would come home and take my pants off right away thinking they were uncomfortable. Come to find out that it was the buckle that was uncomfortable. Buy this and you won't regret it.
5.0,I get a lot of compliments...fun and chic
5.0,Big hit with everybody.
5.0,fits perfect on my 6 ft 9 inch frame
5.0,Bright... Exactly what was expected... Added flare to my playroom with a Yamaha keyboard and Alexia Dot..
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d09cc1da6a18b66908d043ee399e8ea5]] Earrings came in pristine condition, shipped through shipping companies to Jamaica. Chains don't feel delicate so they won't pop with a small yank and the cuff is sturdy enough to handle the required bends. Doesn't need to open and close much to fit around your ear and chains don't get twisted or overlap if put on the ears correctly. All chains are linked properly so they fall from the right angles in the right order and don't look or get tied up. Would definitely recommend!"
5.0,"Fit well, they did not fall off/ball up when wearing."
5.0,Love this dress I have brought 4
5.0,"I just got this today from Amazon and yes, still not cold enough here to put to use, but I tried this baby on and I will tell you if this don't keep your neck warm, prevent drafts going down thru your neck and losing body heat thru the neck area, nothing else will.  Double thick soft fleece that is super warm and will not make your skin itch after wearing it all day long.  I have a Minus33 gaiter made of merino wool, it's good, but the wool makes my skin itch after a time.  I work outside doing security work all year round so staying warm is a top priority.  It also has adjustable cord to make for a perfect fit.  I would recommend this for really cold temps and long exposure outside.  Skiers would love this thing.  I want to add that RefrigWear makes a few gaiters, this is the one you want to get, just make sure it says ""Fleece"", the other cheaper ones are not fleece."
5.0,"I usually wear a size 4 or 5 so I ordered a medium and it fit JUST RIGHT!  Also, from my order date it only took 6 days until it was delivered which is awesome because the delivery window was over a month away!  I have asked the seller when/if they will be getting the same size in the khaki color but they still have not replied.  I really love this skirt as it's very beautiful, is just the right length (a little longer than mid-calf) and looks very classy/tasteful.  I would totally recommend it!"
5.0,Super soft and comfortable! Lighter weight material and stretchy fabric. The top is shorter than I had realized. It kind of fits like a belly shirt. It’s super cute for lounging around in and the pants are adorable!
5.0,Soft feel and sizing is perfect.
5.0,Bought this of my infant son. When we first used them he was 3 months old and they fit perfectly. He didn't seem to mind them since he slept all night at the races.
5.0,I love this necklace!!! Arrived before estimated time and is really well made! Recommended.
5.0,Great case for my subway pass and keys.
5.0,Pídelo un tamaño más. Soy médium y lo pedí large y me quedo Perfecto. Buena calidad!
5.0,"Spanx is my go-to for tights.  These are reasonably comfortable (I would prefer a little less shaping), and the tights feel soft.  Medium gray - not off black, which is a nice change."
5.0,I have small wrists. This watch works great for sizing perfectly. No need to take it to the jeweler. And looks very nice with a suit.
5.0,"Fantastic. Just want I like. Sheer, long sleeves. Perfect, above knee length. I am 5 foot and finding a length like this in a non-petite sizing is great."
5.0,"I love the fabric, very comfortable and ease to wash."
5.0,did not expect this to be as good as it is!! very nice
5.0,Liked the fit and legs feel great!
5.0,I was skeptical but needed to have a Google that I could wear all the time while working in the hospital. These are comfortable on the face and the ears. They don't look like googles which is a plus. One down fall is the lens are small and that makes the transition from reading to looking up difficult.
5.0,"5 pairs of hard to find camo pattern, soft and warm socks for $7.99 !  what's not to like!"
5.0,Used as a lap cover when I have to sit on the front pew at church. Perfect!
5.0,Awesome. Love it. A tiny bit bug but better than any other I bought. I recommend.
5.0,"They are so pretty, not to large, enough to show without being overwhelming. Love the color of the stones."
5.0,These pants are awesome. I have received so many compliments wearing them. They are so comfortable and the fabric washes and dries perfectly.  Highly recommend
5.0,I Love the scarf and hat safe for children. A good protection from the cold
5.0,"I received this mini blender has been Couple weeks .I have been  used it every day to mix banana kiwi different kind fruit and bring to work for drink. I feel that my life is healthy again. Now I am going to travel.  I took this mini blender with me . I bring her anywhere because after mix it can be cup , it’s easy and convenient. Like it very much."
5.0,I received this dress 5 minutes ago and I wanted to write this review for anyone who is on the fence about buying it. This year has been blue for a lot of people I don’t get to see my family this year so I decided that I would get festive for Christmas Day. So so so glad I chose this one. I looked for days at tons of styles . I picked a cheery fun print and some candy cane stocking. It immediately turned my frown upside down. Worth every penny only wish I had bought it sooner so I could have worn it all month. I normally wear a 16 top 18 bottom I got XXL And it’s a little big but really it fits great. The material is a little thin but so are dresses that I have paid $100 for. I threw a long sleeve shirt under it and it’s perfect! My only complaint if I could make one is it a little bit low cut for me nothing that a pin or the shirt doesn’t fix!!! I don’t see how this would not be flattering in any size and it’s so much fun!!
5.0,"Very cute, they look good quality"
5.0,"I love these glasses not ONLY are absolutely gorg, THEY CAME 3 DAYS EARLIER than expected AND they sent me a coupon to get a discount on my next perchase which I WILL DEFINITELY BE DOING!!! If you are second guessing yourself about getting ANYTHING THING from here let this comment put your heart at ease!!!<br /><br />Have a peachy keen day<br />-very satisfied customer 🌻"
5.0,"Boyfriend is a huge Notre Dame fan, he just loves this shirt!"
5.0,"These sweatpans are comfortable, warm, are stretchy enough and roomy enough to wear over long johns with ease.<br />They stretch with any movement, do not bind at the knees and the ankle cuffs are not too tight.<br />The materal has a nice feel, the finishing is perfect inside and out.<br />This is a quality garment, well worth the cost."
5.0,"Cute simple dress, suitable for many occasions"
5.0,"Great product,  came quick and well worth the money."
5.0,"I ordered the green and the pink one.  It was to see which one fit better, but they both were so cute and fit like a glove. The colors were rich and the fabric is a nice soft heavy quality cotton. If you want a dress you can dress up or down this would be it."
5.0,Love these earings looks good on me😉
5.0,I love the look and feel of the leather replacement band for my iWatch. It fits perfectly on the 40mm series 4 iWatch.  Thank you!
5.0,Very sweet notion and gift for a grandma from grandkids!
5.0,I LOVE this headband!! It fits well and does not slide off. It was the perfect size and I will get a lot of use from it.
5.0,"I love them !<br />I’ve been going crazy looking for the perfect grinch slippers, and these are so cute and so comfy ! I’m a size 8 so a Medium fit me perfectly and I have a little extra space."
5.0,Great with casual attire. I customized a maxi dress and t shirt tunic. It was an awesome look. Belt length is perfect.
5.0,"It runs very small. I where medium,  ordered large, still a tight fit."
5.0,"These shirts are very well made. I ordered size L for my husband,  which is the size he wears in ""normal"" shirts. The compression is excellent. The only issue he had was that they are a bit tight at the armpit.  I contacted the seller regarding how to exchange to XL. Without even asking, they apologized and immediately issued a full credit. I ordered XL. Other than the armpits being tight, the rest of the L shirts felt great. The XL's also fit really good. Just not as tight (obviously). So, if you like a good amount of compression, order your ""normal"" size. The same holds true for their compression shorts. (35-36 waist and the L is perfect!)"
5.0,"I was afraid this jacket was going to be cold, because of how thin it is. I have worn it out when the temperture has been down around 10 degrees and seems as warm as my down jacket.  I love this jacket"
5.0,Nice decent product for a construction profession or one that isn’t allowed to wear wedding band all the time for certain reasons this is a good alternative.
5.0,A little small but easy to carry in your pocket
5.0,Nicely made heavy mixture of gauze and linen.  Super cute for a coverup or of you want a different look wear it with a pair of jeans and pull the drawstrings on the side.  I liked it so much I ordered another color. I wear and XL in US size because of my bust and ordered an XXL for oversized look and it’s perfect.  Lots of room. I’m short 5’2 and this comes mid thigh on me.
5.0,"Purchased these for my 12-year old daughter for Christmas.  She LOVES them.  I honestly can not say how the length would be for an adult, but for her at 5'1'' they are pretty long on her still.  She says they are the softest pants she's every had and that they are even softer now that I've washed them."
5.0,"Love this shirt, great price and it fits over my large bust while not bagging on my torso!"
5.0,Beautiful buttons and heavy duty.  Very traditional looking.
5.0,I ordered them a size big and once my son grew into them they were a perfect fit! They are very sturdy for kids that are harsh on shoes :)
5.0,Very comfortable and cushy. Minimal support. Look cute. The fabric is slightly coarse and annoying after several hours of wear.
5.0,Excellent product! Easy to use and very reliable.
5.0,"Young 7 year old twins loved this pocket watch and take it to school every day, just to show off because they can't yet tell time :)"
5.0,"I absolutely love this product. The quality is great, the colours are as shown. The fit is great, the feel is amazing. My only suggestion is that pants should be lined with black instead of white as it appears to be transparent when stretched but they really aren't. It's the lining you're seeing. The quality is great and I will DEFINITELY be looking at other products in the future! The shipping was ON TIME, the service is great. The shipping information updated as it happens. Sounds silly but that doesn't always happen when you shop on Amazon. High 5 90degree by reflex!"
5.0,I love this addition to my wardrobe. It definitely commands attention and I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it.
5.0,"This  has become my everyday basic jacket. This is not something that is going to keep you warm in the dead of winter, however it is an excellent jacket for wearing when you are inside or when it is only cool outside. The material is soft and comfortable, although it did shrink the smallest amount after I washed it the first time. I was actually hoping it would shrink so that it would be slightly more fitted. The quality is excellent and exactly what I expected."
5.0,Fast delivery and daughter loved it
5.0,"I wanted a water proof slim RFID protected wallet and this is it.  I had to throw away a bunch of extra cards for this wallet but that is by design.  Holds 8 cards comfortably, could hold more if you want.  Very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"I love these packing cubes. I have used them 4 times now and they keep my suitcase so organized. The mesh on the top makes it really easy for me to find what I am looking for. I like the bags for the shoes too, now I don't have to try and pack them around the edges of the suitcase. I would highly recommend these cubes to anyone."
5.0,I bought this for my niece and she loved it!
5.0,Love it!  It will make a great Christmas gift.  Probably will glitter it up a little to make it gaudy looking.
5.0,Love all the colors and arrived sooner than thought.
5.0,These are so pretty!!!!
5.0,These gloves are way better than I ever expected! They're super warm! I've had more expensive gloves in the past and these surpass those by far! I needed something to keep my hands warm while walking the doggos and these do the trick! I'll be ordering these again if they wear out in a few years.
5.0,I love them. So cute. Exactly as pictured.
5.0,Nice looking and feature
5.0,Great value for the price. They work
5.0,"I am very pleased with my purchase. It's lovely and elegant and can't wait to give it to my friend on her Birthday next month. I'm even contemplating getting one for myself.  Also worth mentioning, is the customer service is remarkable and this lady truly cares about her customers and is passionate about her jewelry. AAA+++"
5.0,Nephew loves the socks
5.0,my daughter loved these
5.0,3rd pair of these sunglasses we bought. Best sunglasses. Comfortable sturdy stylish.
5.0,"This is my new fave sandal brand. Way comfier and easier to break in tHan Birkenstock. I’m in my 20s but want healthy feet and style! The metallic is very cool,"
5.0,Got them for grandkids and they are a good polarized product. They all liked the way they fit and the color they chose.
5.0,"Original y divertido, calidad correspondiente a precio"
5.0,"It is summer time here in is approaching in South Texas. . . what that means is a lot of beer drinking, fishing and floating the river. When you combine those 3, it guarantees losing sunglasses. A friend of mine had some of these last summer and I really liked them. Nice and light, fit perfect and the lens are crystal clear with no glaring. The case they come with is nice as well. The cost is perfect for someone like me who loses a lot of sunglasses. Great purchase, no regrets."
5.0,"Gorgeous dress!!! It is elegant and extremely comfortable. GREAT quality! I wash in gentle cycle and hang dry to preserve the quality. I get so many compliments every time I wear this beautiful dress. I’m 5’4, 115 lbs and the S fit perfectly. This is my go to dress for the office or work events."
5.0,great quality shirt
5.0,"Love those shirts! Bought 3 . Great quality fabric, they don’t fade or shrink even in hot water and dryer, and no wrinkles."
5.0,The dress was cute and fit to size.
5.0,Very high quality. Looks very Native American. Arrived early.
5.0,Excellent quality and great looks.<br /><br />I like the removable inner liner.
5.0,this is exactly what I wanted
5.0,Very attractive and easy to wear.  I received numerous compliments.

5.0,I loved the colors in this blouse! It was airy and perfect for me while I was pregnant
5.0,Beautiful design and great quality. I highly recommend this company.
5.0,"I wasn't sure on the sizing but I ordered an xl and xxl. xl fit perfectly, I'm 5'3 and 180 lbs. I have a small bust and it fit me well. Only thing is, it's very short, will wear pantyhose with it. I'm wearing it to a wedding next weekend and happy about the purchase!"
5.0,"I am stuck on the couch healing from a severe injury and would pull a blanket over my elevated leg and up to my waist to leave my arms and hands free to use my phone or type, leaving my top half and arms chilly. This shawl is perfect for draping around my shoulders/arms and still leaving my hands free. It is a bit more light-weight material than I expected, but it is warm enough for indoors and for a cool day outside."
5.0,"I got this band for the Pebble Time Round 20mm. For the price this is a high quality and good looking band, I'm happy overall. The color is more of a tan brown, which makes for a nice contrast with a black watch face. The band was a bit of a tight squeeze to put on initially, however I was able to install it without issue--the quick release pins like the factory Pebble band is a nice touch.<br /><br />My wrist is about 6 1/4 inch around, and I have the band on the third hole; those with very small wrists should take note."
5.0,My sister and mother love it's.
5.0,"A little large for my 10 year old but he will grow into it. He wears it large. Nice button up sleeves make this an ideal 3 season shirt. It's very ""happening"". It doesn't look like kids wear- I wouldn't mind one for myself. Finding natural fiber kids wear in this price range- its a no brainier. I wouldn't pass it by. Recommended!"
5.0,Amazing product! Rawlings leather is top notch and one of a kind! I have 6 cards and cash in it
5.0,Granddaughter loved it- will have to order more for Christmas presents .
5.0,Nice tote
5.0,i have purchased from In Season multiple time and have always loved their products!
5.0,Cute funky sunglasses with a great tint that blocks out the sun's rays.
5.0,Great t-shirt; wear it all the time! Long sleeved but light to wear.
5.0,One size fits all it just becomes longer if your a size small. Matches just about everything in my closet seeing the shawl is full of different colors.
5.0,I got 3 in Xl and L for a few camping friends. They all fit perfect!
5.0,These are adorable. They are subtle because they are so small. I am able to leave these in while I sleep and not have any pain which is sometimes a problem with other earrings.
5.0,Love these pants. Better in person then in a pic.
5.0,Love them! Great quality!
5.0,"My son loves how the pictures appear when it gets wet. Good fit, nice color, and has held up well so far."

5.0,"Love my earings, just the right size and I used them daily."
5.0,Perfect as always and they’re even better with paracord!
5.0,I ordered this ring on the 23rd of April and received it May 2nd. Such a great solid ring.
5.0,Great masks!  Colors are perfect! Cloth is smooth and soft and holding up wr to<br />Lots of washing:)
5.0,Good material. Just like photo
5.0,My mom wanted a apron so I bought her this apron for Christmas and she loves it
5.0,This thing looks great and fits so much better than the default band that came with my Apple Watch SE it’s definitely my new weekend band
5.0,Love this sweater!!  It's exactly what I was looking for!!
5.0,LOVE THIS! I have this wallet in the black and light pink and love both! They look just like a late spade wallet but so much less than the price!
5.0,The charms were actually bigger than I expected. Nice coloring and they are sturdy.
5.0,LOVE these pants. Comfortable and great breathable fabric. Fabric is not too thin and not too thick.  I'm petite and the length is perfect for me.  Can't wait to order more.
5.0,"These stockings are wonderful for the cold weather!  Yes,  they are thick!  The fabric is tight and coloring is good!<br />Great boot sock.  And, if you wear these with regular winter shoes,  make sure you have a dab of foot room!"
5.0,I love this watch. It looks awesome and is very accurate and reliable. It’s worth a lot more than 10 bucks. Starting a Casio Watch collection now because I’m enjoying this beauty so much.
5.0,"Very good value.  I really like it, it goes with so many things for that special and different look."
5.0,"Came as intended, no scratches, nothing bent, came in with case and cloth. Great product! Looks great for males too. Can confirm, am male"
5.0,"This very fuzzy pink robe is the first thing my granddaughter reaches for every morning. She likes to get ready for bed early so she can spend her story-time wrapped in this soft cuddle garment. It washes and dries very well. After being worn every day for months and washed appropriately, the robe is still soft and fluffy. I highly recommend this robe."
5.0,"These are the best, so much easier to walk indoors and out"
5.0,Must buy absolutely cute and comfortable
5.0,liked it!!!
5.0,I just received these today and order the small. Thought they would be a little tight but actually still had some room left. Easy to switch out and getting the little pin is a bit hard for some but was able to get it in after some strength. Overall they feel soft and look nice!
5.0,I love this hat!  The green is a great shade.  Wish I'd bought it earlier in the season.<br /> I'll order it in another color next year and may even given them as gifts.
5.0,It adheres to the contours. Looks great but needs Spanx underneath. :).
5.0,"These have exceeded my expectations as a performer and fashion stylist. They are heavy, well made and I will be ordering other colors."
5.0,"Bought this to wear to work.  I always get lots of compliments.  Only negative is the watch came running, so I'm sure I will have to replace battery sooner than I would like."
5.0,"My son loved!, and uses daily!"
5.0,fits well and washes well
5.0,wonderful ring.
5.0,"they are a bit lighter than the original Maui Jim Makaha lenses, but the price and quality overall were excellent.  I would have paid 3 times the amount to get the lenses replaced by Maui Jim!  Thinking of trying out the different colors to change up the look.  I couldn't be happier with the product!"
5.0,Great ! Soft to prevent scratches and I know where my glasses are when I need them!
5.0,ordered smallest size available in white . I am 5'3 110 pounds
5.0,I wore these socks for a 10 mile race and they were extremely comfortable. I liked the length and design. My feet did not sweat and I did not get any blisters. Great product.
5.0,It looks gorgeous and elegant in real. I adore this color and I bought a red wine purse from another seller to match it with the handbag. I am satisfied with my purchase
5.0,Great jacket. fits very well on the shoulders and chest. Lot of lint inside the hood and forearms so just a heads up if you happen to wear this out before washing it.
5.0,"I just got these in the mail and I already love them. I got them as sort of summertime lazing around the house attire and they're EXACTLY what I expected. Also one word: POCKET. I was not expecting a useful little pocket on the front right leg! On pants like these it's what I would call the ""emergency pocket"" for when you suddenly need two hands with nowhere to put what you're holding. A note on the length and where the cuffs hang: I am a 6'2 man and standing up the cuffs hang at exactly ankle level on me. That's where they're SUPPOSED to hang. Again perfect for summertime lounging. Just google ""thai fisherman pants"" and the images, for the most part, will give you a good idea of what to expect. Cheers."
5.0,Item arrived earlier than expected. Very well made shirt. Not to lightweight not too heavy it's just right. Good color just as pictured. Thank you
5.0,The keyrings were perfect for my school project for kids.  Each one was packaged individually in a resealable bag so none of them were scratched.  It was easy to place a two sided image into it and snap it back into place.  I was then able to put them back in the bag for gifting.  Good value!
5.0,"Very nice! Be careful when you click for the name to be engraved. I got one and it should have said Jordan, it said Sophia. Apparently something didn't click right and I didn't notice. I ordered again and got the right one and love it. It is for my granddaughter and she will love it."
5.0,"Using these for my Data cosplay. They are really wonderful and in great condition, except one of them was kind of tarnished- but that's alright, it was just the back! Also, for some reason the package smelled like cig smoke- not a big deal though."
5.0,Awesome....great packaging too...And super fast shipping....Thank You!
5.0,These are what I have been looking for for such a long time! The large ones aren’t to large and you can mix and match. I also have very sensitive ears and these didn’t irritate them at all.
5.0,This polishing cloth works great. It cleans and shines jewelry very nicely. I love it!!!
5.0,Great product great seller!
5.0,Love everything about these
5.0,Excellent sticker.
5.0,This is a great dress for my daughter because she starting to get boobs and the lace in the front is perfect - makes it not to share and adds texture.
5.0,"Love these pants! I’m ordering all the colors now! Great material , a little stretch, flattering slack!"
5.0,These are quite beautiful. Well made. Will buy from this seller again.
5.0,for the price will work for what i needed it for
5.0,Beautiful necklace.. Christmas gift.
5.0,"When I’m wearing a fancier outfit, I still like to be able to take my Apple Watch with me. And with adorable watch bands, it makes it feel less clunky and more dainty for those special occasions. I really love a little razzle-dazzle, so when I saw this watchband, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />I got the smaller of the two watchband sizes since I have a smaller wrist, and this one fit me perfectly, not too tight, and not too loose, which are my pet peeves. The watch band itself feels pretty sturdy, but I wouldn’t pull on it too much or else it might break, and the beads might come off. So far, so good.  I’ve had similar watchband break on me at about the 4 to 6 month mark, so we’ll see how this one holds up."
5.0,"Great belts, strong leather, fit my ratchet buckles perfect."
5.0,Cz is beautiful bezel is smooth and post and backs fit well.
5.0,Great sunglasses case. It fits the larger glasses style. The package arrived sooner than anticipated. I would recommend this product and this seller.
5.0,"This sweatsuit set is my new favorite! I freeze and this is nice and warm. I’m fairly short (4’11) and the legs aren’t crazy long. They taper around the ankle and I don’t find that bothersome or too small in fit. The material is medium weight-heavy. So VEaray warm and cozy. The size is true to size, but I find the pants a little snug/fitted in the thigh area, so if you want baggy/loose, you may want to upsize. It washes well, and has minimal to no shrinkage, or fading. When dried it has minimal to no wrinkles. Would make a good gift!"
5.0,"I LOVED this dress! It was so beautiful, and just the right amount of sexy and classy. Shows some cleavage, but comes to the knee, so it's appropriate for what I used it for, a wedding. Fabric was thick and stretchy. The green was really deep too, just the color I wanted. Was able to dance all night and never have to tug, pull, or stretch anything. Was like I was wearing comfy clothes."
5.0,Very cute and small. Surprisingly good quality too.
5.0,"Love the color, although I ordered the pink and it looks more like coral. I haven’t worn it off the shoulders, but it’s just as pretty worn like a normal dress."
5.0,Fit great for the Gump costume I assembled!
5.0,Worked well for what we needed it for. Kept feet warm and comfortable
5.0,I love these. Got them on time and they were perfectly packaged. No damage at all.
5.0,"These gloves, it should be noted, are for someone who has long, slender fingers. I ordered a size L [and had to return] them as unfortunately they were not a good fit. They are however, beautiful and very well made. If they fit you, you will be very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Jacket sleeves to short
5.0,"The XL size fits great.  I'm a tall - big guy, hem at top does not bind up or cut off circulation.  I have tried many brands within amazon - I'll buys these again."
5.0,Love the fit and it looks really nice.
5.0,Really cute.  Next time though I will ask for the flower without the headband attached and use Girlie Glue to hold them on.  Then they don't slip off and around her head.
5.0,"I Bought these for my wife 3 years ago to match her wedding ring, which is a sapphire surrounded by diamonds. The great thing about these earrings is that the diamonds really catch the light and end up highlighting the deep blue sapphires. They are very eye catching. They look gorgeous on her and she loves them. I think she's worn these every day for the past 3 years! This is a good buy."
5.0,I wore this to a wedding and I received so many compliments! It is made with very nice material and very well made. the waist line is a little high but it still looks super cute. I can wait to order my next dress!
5.0,Hooray for this shirt! Wear this in public in order to draw other awesome people to you. Avoid anyone who doesn't know what the shirt means.
5.0,"super soft leather, big enough to fit all your credit cards and money.  also will fit your keys."
5.0,"This clutch is so very CHRISTMAS gift giving worthy. I really, really like this pouch/clutch. Very roomy and large. Great for a fun Holiday Clutch or filled with goodies as a gift."
5.0,Good!  It isn’t see through
5.0,This is my second time ordering these .. I love them to pieces.. Very versitile
5.0,Loved the tank tops I bought over the summer so I was e excited to finally they made these in Long sleeve. Fits great and wicks sweat away quickly. Also helps keep me warm.
5.0,Nice quality and price.
5.0,Wife purchased this so she could find her sun glasses in her purse. Works great.
5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this dress. It's thicker material for colder weather, almost like sweatshirt material. Hangs very well on the body, good length, and very well made. I will be buying another color of same dress, I love it that much."
5.0,"I love my earrings, they were exactly as I had hope they would be"
5.0,"Solid aglets. Didn't come with the little screwdriver, but your standard phillips head works just fine.  The aglets have yet to come off in the wash and seem to be quite durable."
5.0,"Excellent eueglass case for any oversized glasses. Mine are very superstar, ‘No pictures, please’ oversized and they fit perfectly fine. Excellent buy"
5.0,They do not slip like most socks. Very happy with them.
5.0,"Love it! The color is great, it's soft, stays tied and is really comfortable."
5.0,Was more than I expected.I got compliments all day when I wore this to a function. The material was thick and did not have too much spandex so it was not riding up to my hips. I will definately buy from Rephyllis again. They earned my trust.
5.0,"I loved the style and the fabric.  We had ""church spirit"" with an African attire theme. Also, this dress was /is unlike the usual African garment.  It stands out because of its unique style.  It was ""noticeable."""
5.0,These  socks are so comfortable! Helped with the arc support and they washes well. Highly recommended.

5.0,Cool shape and heavy duty
5.0,Siempre e tenido uno.
5.0,This clear bag seems to be well made of good quality materials.  I love that my iPad Air 2 fits nicely inside.
5.0,"I bought this suitcase two years ago, and it's been my companion on numerous trips to Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East.  Tough and dependable like all of Filson's products, this one has stood up to the worst abuse that travel by air and overland in third-world countries could dish out, and it only looks better with age and the accumulated grit.  This bag isn't for everyone; it's on the heavy side, and lacks a lot of the frills of contemporary nylon luggage.  But if toughness and simplicity are what you're looking for, then this suitcase is a good investment - which Filson guarantees for life."
5.0,"I wanted something funky, but not too crazy.  The cat eye shape is not too large to overpower my face. It's a perfect size. I have a medium size oval face.  The treat was the little glitter &#34;patch.&#34;  That took this cute cat eye to a funky level. Not only is there a little gold glitter patch that you see on one side of the front of the glasses -- the glitter extends to the enter handle on that side.  (It's a hard gold-colored plastic with gold glitter inside.) I LOVE these glasses.  One side is conservative, but there is a great hint of funky which I wanted. They're perfect!"
5.0,I've purchased before from this company. The quality is excellent. The products are exactly as pictured.<br />Very pleased!
5.0,"Love them. Just what I needed. The only sucky thing was the time of delivery, it took too long to receive."
5.0,The pants are beautiful.

5.0,"My daughter wears this bracelet for the first few weeks of school and it holds up great. After a year of wearing it, getting wet, and being stuffed in her backpack it still looks great."
5.0,Worked well with my 45 year-old Timex.  This is a good replacement band option for &#34;beater watches&#34; that are intended for use when working in the garden or doing chores. The tool for inserting the band connectors worked ok.
5.0,"I teach at a preschool and the kids absolutely loved these earrings! I like that it is made of felt and was very soft to the touch. The kids loved petting the bears. :) So far, it seems to be well-made. I hope they make a black bear soon, because that's my favorite kind of bear."
5.0,I purchased this charm to go on my Pandora bracelet and it fits well. It's very good quality for the money! The details on the charm are excellent and I can't wait to show it off!
5.0,"Fit is fine, not very soft. Wore to an Sandler concert, so served its purpose, just not hubby's favorite shirt as material is not as soft as most other shirts."
5.0,Big enough to wear on head
5.0,this watch band was a fantastic buy!  it's long enough to fit even my big wrist and it's simple easy to put on.  going to buy another for my other watch.
5.0,"I love the idea of the bracelet,  but the silver coat does fade off the a pinkish/brassy color and not in a flattering way. If you still buy it, do a coat or sealant over it."
5.0,Great chain nice and heavy. I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review.
5.0,Absolutely love these glasses great quality and fashionable. Love Love ❤️
5.0,For wearing my dresss

I found it so convenient that I ordered these additional four as soon as I got home.<br />It was so easy to tuck into my purse and have when we went to the Coop for groceries and for those delightful purchases we made on our adventures to beautiful hill towns.<br />My husband and my cousin both counted on my Baggu, so next time I’ll take a couple and plan to give one of these to my cousin for her next trip."

5.0,Its a green tie!
5.0,Comfortable and nice shirt for vacation or hanging out around town. Can dress up or down.
5.0,"Adorable outfit. The shirt has snaps on bottom, so it won't ride up the whole time- so smart.<br />The pants are perfect length and width for my skinny baby. The straps have 2 buttons, so you can choose which is best for your child. They were still a bit too long for my son, so I just moved the buttons."
5.0,Very nice product packaged very good  nice glasses
5.0,Nice sweater. It was just too big for me. Hopefully it will shrink.
5.0,Shipped fast and exactly as described!
5.0,Wish I could get more right like these cape length more colors

5.0,Great fit!  I would buy from in the future!
5.0,"Had some wrist pain doing jerks and snatches. After reading some reddit reviews I went with getting a cloth wrist wrap which provides the stability needs for olympic weightlifting while not being overly tight. These met my expectations. It's easy to put on and provides decent support. My wrist pain was not completely eliminated, but mitigated enough to keep doing snatches and jerks. Over the period of a couple weeks my wrist pain subsided I think in part of the reduce strain with the help of these wraps."
5.0,Loved this!  I'm 5'2&#34; and this fit me perfectly!
5.0,I bought this dress because I had to wear green at a party. I received so many compliments. I love the way the dress looks on me. Makes<br />me look slim. Ha Ha. I enjoyed wearing this dress and I dont regret purchasing it.

5.0,These are really nice goggles. The strap has a buckle on the back which you can use to open and close or else you can just stretch them over your head like regular goggles.They fit everyone we have tried them on from age 8-40. They are easy to adjust and have 4 ways to adjust them in the back.They did not give me any discomfort and they kept the water out of my eyes. They did not leak at all. They have a nice mirrored UV protective face that is great for doing anything in an outdoor pool. The vision is very good in the water as well.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
5.0,"I LOVE this dress! It's so comfortable and fits just right. Not see through at all like some other thin dresses I've ordered online. The pockets area a cute plus! It's a tad tight under my arms and I haven't ever had that issue before ordering in my usual XL size, but fits great otherwise! Still in love, great for work and other outings."
5.0,"Beautiful,  classic small option to an actual hoop.  Smaller size may get lost in long hair but great for shorter styles, younger people or a second piercing."
5.0,Better than what I thought nice size my wife loved them
5.0,A fun piece to wear with casual attire.  Lots of compliments!
5.0,"I own a handful of watches, mostly have paid a few hundred dollars for each. I decided to get this one mostly because of the price and it looked great too. When I received the watch, my expectations were blown away! This feels and looks like a watch that's in the hundreds of dollars. Very clean, simple and elegant."
5.0,Great fit. Fine material .
5.0,This is beautiful. Hugs the right places without constricting too much. Your underwear will not show when wearing.

5.0,"Wow. Awesome piece, well worth it."
5.0,"I love this bag :) it’s made of great material, it’s pretty spacious (smaller than a school backpack though, wouldn’t recommend it for computers or school stuff) and it’s super cute :) it’s like a cheaper kanken. I’d recommend it for sleepovers, carry-ons, days of school where u don’t really need a full backpack. I love the color variety too"
5.0,I just received my order it was nice. The steching on it was very nice and the skull is Very cute. It came just as expected on the model and the jacket is like a cotton field whis is another thing I like it's long and retro pictures coming soon😍😍

5.0,Just like the photo♥️
5.0,Great sports bra. Love the fit and support.
5.0,"I ordered this cardigan to wear to a wedding and it did not disappoint, especially for the price! It draped nicely and elegantly, almost like a shawl, but has actual sleeves so it didn’t fall off. I wish I had a picture of me wearing it to the wedding, but I was busy chasing a toddler and wearing a newborn. I was afraid because of the baggy sleeves that carrying my backpack diaper bag would be a problem, but it was at all. I am really happy with this purchase and will wear it often."

5.0,Not a good pant
5.0,"I just received these. I read another review that said these rings are always more slender in terms of width than what’s pictured. I think I agree however I’m not disappointed at all with my purchase. I wear a size 9 and so I ordered a 9 despite the mixed reviews and it fits perfectly. Not too tight at all. True to color. As you can see, they compliment my blue band beautifully and that was the goal!"
5.0,Extactly same as picture even more beautiful
5.0,This colorful shirt became my grandson’s favorite gift. He loves the game and said it was “epic”! It’s smooth texture kept it wrinkle free and it was true to his regular size. (I went “up” a size for growth and comfort for the hot southern summer.) You won’t be disappointed with this purchase.

5.0,"Best purchase on Amazon! I know this product is 100% authentic, as I own several MBMJ. What an awesome deal for a brand new bag! Sooo happy I came across this gorgeous bag!!❤️"
5.0,"I bought this for my 2 year old Grandaughter to go with a pink ballerina outfit I got for her.  She looked adorable with this on her little head.  When she saw the crown, she got so excited, she started dancing and I had to chase her down to put it on her head.  She was exclaiming, &#34;I a allerina! I a alteriina, MiMi!&#34;  (allerina= ballerina)  Any little girl will feel very special in this baby pink, sparkly tiara. Add a little shine to any child's day with this purchase & the price is just right!"
5.0,Its beautiful luv it
5.0,I love this wallet because it is the right size and is thin which fits better in most handbags.  I also looks and feels like snakeskin.
5.0,Excellent price and quality
5.0,Everyone loves this necklace. I always get asked where I got it from.
5.0,Fantastic! They are so chic and fashionable! So light and comfortable... can't wait to order other colors
5.0,I like it. Durable.
5.0,"This is a substantial piece of chronometric art.  It's big, heavy, and beautifully crafted."
5.0,"I like the fabric not that shiny cheap looking stuff, these look more vintage or &#34;real&#34;."
5.0,looks exactly as it appears on screen. I really love this color. This is only for women's watches though. It won't fit a man size or even unisex size watch.
5.0,I bought these in size Small because the reviews suggested. They fit but not the way I wanted them to. So I returned them and got the XS. So now I love these! They fit like a glove!
5.0,Personalization was correct and it shipped very  quickly. Very cute. I'm happy with this purchase!
5.0,"Bought for my husband, but now I like to steal it from time to time! It is super comfortable,  stretchy, deep pockets and the material is breathable.  The laser lines look great in person. I would say it's a tiny bit short in the torso area, but the sleeves fit great on him. The v-neck is a little deep for guys, but he always wears an under shirt, for women the vneck is fine, but I am a bit of a bigger girl."
5.0,"Love, love, love this dress. The color is gorgeous, the fit is perfect! The material is very nice, not too thick or thin. Love it!"

5.0,I bought the piece
5.0,These look really good on my husband and I hope will be perfect for our Mexico trip. He says they are nice and light weight but not see through. They are a little baggy and long on him. He usually wears a 34/36 waist and a 30/32 length depending on the pants. The drawstring is nice with super cute beads that will be perfect for Mexico also.
5.0,good fit looks great fells nice.
5.0,Looks good and feels good. Like it a lot.
5.0,Love these. I get compliments every time i wear them
5.0,Perfect dress for a early dinner or brunch!!!!<br />This is a must have.
5.0,The earrings are very nice. They are beautiful and comfortable to wear.
5.0,My husband LOVES these socks. The compression these provide give him added support he needs while running. He needs arch support and sometimes it is hard to find that in running shoes. These socks provide the arch compression and support he needs in order to keep his feet and back from hurting like it does with regular socks and running shoes. Highly recommend! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,great looking & great value!
5.0,Bought the next size up. Fits great
5.0,"My daughter loves it very much! Not just follow the example figures, but create lots of new shapes by herself!"
5.0,They are my favor for everyday wear.  They are comfortable all day long.
5.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Mom.  When I received the slippers I was pleased with the appearance. They appear to be a very sturdy pair of slippers.  They are an excellent mix of comfort and support.  She is very pleased with these slippers.
5.0,Love em.
5.0,Love my skull sunglasses!!!😎
5.0,Husband loved it sleeves were a little tight.
5.0,"Ok, in all fairness, I've only used it once, since I got the &#34;expanded capability&#34; set last week. But that combined with the watch back press is a dream. I've already broken one crystal trying to get a watch back on, then chipped another. That's why I bought the watch back press and this set with even more dies. And I'm very glad I did! As it turned out the watch I needed to get a back on didn't really fit in the ones that came with the press and one in this set fit it just great. Getting the back on was great. I like to wear different watches and it is so much nicer to just be able to change them at home rather than pay $10 or more to have a battery changed in a jewelry store. The dies seem really well made and I'm so glad I bought this set up."
5.0,"Great quality. Use it for my concealed carry, some tools, extra magazines, electronics. Cool product. Heavy duty."
5.0,"Yes, I'm a bigger woman but I try to dress nice, this top feels like silk and feels cool. It does not cling, it flows, looks great with jeans and leggings. Great price, great style. I can whole heartily recommend, dont buy bigger hoping it will shrink to your size, it comes fitting just right. Hats off to seller!"
5.0,Very satisfied with this purchase.

5.0,They are well made and look really rich..loving my new earrings!
5.0,Small simple and flat.
5.0,"Super cute bikini. Very classic, sleek and won’t go out of style.  It’s your basic black bikini.  Fits well and the fabric is durable. I like the side ties, makes it truly a string bikini.  There are pads in the top which can be removed.  One thing to note is that this does not have underwire, so if your ladies are on the large side, might not be much support.  But overall very well made suit."
5.0,it exceeded my expectations! Loved it!
5.0,The outfit was just perfect for my interview for my Pageant.
5.0,Love the fit! High neckline makes it a very modest and pretty choice

5.0,Muy Bonito me encanto gracias
5.0,Love this!  Comfort fit is the way to go.
5.0,"I ordered these for my son, his other watch band broke. These were easy to put on and he loves the texture! There is a little bit of a texture on the outside. They are flexable and comfortable. They look to be very durable. He has only had them for a couple of weeks, but they seem luke good quality so far."
5.0,Easy put together and great price.
5.0,"Great gift for grand child. Love the motion detection bomb sound,"
5.0,They’re perfect 🤩 worth every penny!
5.0,Love these well made and comfortable materials - I’m 5.3 and usually a medium but with these I get a small and they fit perfect.
5.0,Perfect size for my essentials without compromising looks. Easy to carry and find all my things. I am very happy with my purchase.
5.0,It is a very nice coat but the sizes run very small. I normally wear a large I ordered an x-large and it was tight around my waist strange I had to return disappointed.
5.0,"The perfect pajamas to enjoy a good night's rest. They are extremely comfortable,lightweight."
5.0,"I just got these, so I don't know how they with withstand an actual flight - but they seem so sturdy! I wasn't expecting much as the price was awesome so I was a little nervous. But as soon as I opened them, I was very pleasantly surprised! They are a perfect size, not too small. Maybe 3&#34; by 4&#34;? Just a guess. They are also very thick and sturdy -like a thick silicone, rubber material. My only notice was the paper that you write your info on, can slide out a little easily. BUT all I will do is put a little piece of double sided tape or something inside. This in no way is a huge issue.<br />So far, I would say I would buy again. Perfect for our upcoming Disney World trip. My Star Wars loving boy is so excited that he gets his own luggage this time, and now he'll flip over his tags.<br />I will update if the tags don't hold up through the flight, but looking at the strap now, I don't have any concerns at all!"
5.0,Love this bra! Very comfortable! I have a large chest and it is difficult finding bras that fit well and are still comfy. This is both.
5.0,These are cute and comfortable. Run small. I normally wear an 8 so I ordered an 8.5 and my foot fills the whole shoe. I probably should have ordered a 9.
5.0,Came as described/pictured. Cute little dress and a great price
5.0,I'm using this for my Harley Quinn Steampunk cosplay costume and it's a perfect substitute for a joker like collar.
5.0,"These are great, look just like the picture but unfortunately we returned them because of the size of the loop. For reference, we were using them with the silicone string for kids bracelets (the kind that hook inside each end) and could not fit them over the ends of the brackets. Would be great for older kids with more dexterity that can use thinner string."
5.0,Cute with lots of options
5.0,"These are great socks - very comfortable and stylish:). They arrived early  & were well packaged.  Good price, too."
5.0,"I'd been looking for a comfortable, adjustable, removable but secure mask extender for two months.  This is the best thing I've found.  It clips and secures to the ear loops on a mask, so you can pull your mask down around your neck when you are alone, but it is super easy to pull back up when needed.  And it takes the pressure of the backs of your ears which can get irritated.  I've ordered them for twenty employees and everyone loves them."
5.0,"Bought this for my granddaughter to take with her to preschool.  Lots of pockets, which come in handy, and her bento-style lunchbox fits easily.  Got the yellow one for visibility, easy to find / locate."
5.0,Very large good for costume.
5.0,"Only had for a few days, but so far these are perfect for my work where I'm often looking down. It saves me from my glasses slipping at all and doesn't tight or uncomfortable."
5.0,Worth the money they're real and beautiful
5.0,I love this skirt...arrives on Friday and wore it today. Beautiful fit I took the large
5.0,Loved fit & fun pattern !
5.0,This was fantastic in my recent dive. Good quality. Stylish. I wore this under my wetsuit when diving a 50 degree ocean. It kept me warmer and was easy to put on.Works well.It’s a great price and will definitely be using it again.
5.0,Great looking and nice quality
5.0,It’s a great quality hat. My guy loves it! Wears it often! Can be casual or dressy. You won’t regret getting it.
5.0,Good quality.  Columbia always had great merchandise in clothing and other outdoor gear.
5.0,They fit right over my reading glasses
5.0,I did lose one or two buttons within the first few times wearing them.
5.0,Item delivered promptly and as advertised - excellent!
5.0,"Thick sweater and very true to size in my opinion. The large size is loose and comfy. I’ve washed this under cold water and hung dry, absolutely no shrinkage."
5.0,"This bra is the best bang for the buck.  Structured well, excellent lift and comfort like no other which is always the big ticket issue for full figured women.  It looks pretty and does not flop after a long day."
5.0,Y love my dress
5.0,Very cute and nephew loves them

5.0,Excellent product!!!. Well orgarnized with smooth leather and sturdy fabrication.
5.0,This will be my perfect &#34;something blue&#34;
5.0,"Very cool. These are my first titanium split rings. So far they are excellent. Easier than most split rings I've used in the past. I used three to separate groups if items on my key chain. Lighter than I thought, too. Overall very useful and snappier than the old ones."
5.0,"This has become my granddaughter's favorite nightgown. The fabric is a perfect weight, soft yet it holds its shape after laundering. A real hit!"
5.0,Quantity for amount paid is a 10/10
5.0,i like the wires versus plastic holder
5.0,So cute with an awesome twist to a classic white buttondown
5.0,Great quality! Came quickly and exactly as pictured.
5.0,"the dress is amazing. the fabric is high quality, and feels so good. the fit is perfect, and the length falls right at the floor."
5.0,Great for what it says.  My dad loves them! Wears them everyday
5.0,"I love this earring and was glad I decided on this one. The reviews definitely helped me decide, I was torn between a few earrings. It is small and not gaudy, just the right amount of bling. Definitely worth the money!"
5.0,Quality seems to be good and durable. Hat is taller than expected but not unsightly.
5.0,Cute and comfortable wear for an active boy. I like that there is no rubber bands touching the skin. Good thing that the set come with 2 pairs of underpants
5.0,I got my charms but a lot of the holes to put the string through either broke or came off
5.0,"THE KIDS LOVE THEM, THEY'RE A BIG HIT!!!"
5.0,I wore this in Hawaii on a sunset dinner cruise. My husband loved how this dress looked on me. I will buy in other colors.
5.0,Our 5 and 7 year old grandkids loved their telescope necklaces.  They had a lot of fun discovering that they really worked too.  Great for taking with us on walks.
5.0,"beautiful hoop, I have got 24 mm size perfect for every day, not too big, look classy and stylish.<br />24mm size slightly bigger then a quarter, love this size. very happy with a purchase."
5.0,I got these for my mom who broke her wrist and has had a swollen hand since that time so she’s been unable to wear her wedding rings. They’re cute and she has several color options to choose from. Not each of the rings within the package was the same size and she just stretched them out a bit and the smaller ones were then fine.
5.0,So soft and very well made.  I’ve been into tie dye lately & this has a nice combination of colorful & vibrant colors.  I even wore the top to work one day.  So comfy.
5.0,Like these Jean's.  Buy again fit great
5.0,"We have used these masks for the majority of the pandemic, they fit well on all of our family members (teens and adults) They are great for anyone who has mask anxiety because they don't rest against your face .<br /><br />This time packaging was very damaged in shipping the bag was torn, box crushed and it looked like the contents had been dumped out and tried to be put back in."
5.0,"I love these sunglasses. I got them back in September, that’s 9-10 months and they are still in good shape. I get lots of compliments on the shape and gold rim. I really wish they would sell more! I would buy a few more pairs! I also have always struggled to find sunglasses that fit my face and these ones feel great. They don’t fall down when I’m doing activities or tasks and they don’t scoot  up when I’m smiling for a picture :))"
5.0,"I did quite a bit of reviewing prior to making my purchase and Indie Ridge came through with the absolute best reviews.  My Face Mask arrived today and it was even better than expected; Quality, Comfort and Performance!  Of course, it will also prove to be a valuable allies in this battle to get through the pandemic.  So what else could a company do?  Well folks, they also provide a ""No-Questions-Asked"" lifetime Warranty!  Impressive to say the least, so if you're looking for a Face Mask from a SOLID company, folks look no further than Indie Ridge.."
5.0,Like I thought it would be.my wife loves it!!
5.0,"loved all the sweatshirts, fit wonderful, nice and cozy just love them."
5.0,These fits perfect and the style is nice
5.0,These were more narrow than expected but have held up well to frequent use. Husband loves them - he’s a serious FCB fanatic. Will likely purchase another set ‘just in case’.
5.0,Daughter love her big earmuff!
5.0,"The dress looks like it does in the photos. It's  super-comfortable, and the pockets are very generous. I can fit my very large smartphone in them easily, and you can't even tell it's there because the pockets are so deep and the skirt of the dress is so flowy. As mentioned in other reviews, if you're short like me (5'2""), you will need to wear high-heeled shoes or to hem it. I hemmed mine so I could wear it with a low heel or flats and not worry about stepping on it. I was apprehensive about hemming this fabric myself, since I don't do a ton of sewing and have only hemmed jeans and cotton dresses before. But it was super-easy, and I didn't even have to cut any off—just folded and hemmed—since it didn't need to be much shorter.<br /><br />I will definitely be wearing this dress in the spring, summer, and fall. On cooler days I'll wear a light jacket or sweater. I could probably wear it on mild winter days, too (I'm in the south), with a jean jacket or sweater and leggings underneath."
5.0,"These ring blanks are really BIG. Big as in the settings are huge, but the ring that goes around your finger is normal and adjustable to fit most hands. They are super pretty and I have some nice cabochons that will fit in them.  They are easy for beginner jewelry makers because all you need is some e-6000 glue and a cabochon, and just glue it right in there.  You can make your own cabochon with resin or mod melts (by Modge Podge) and they have some nice molds that will make cabochons that fit nicely.  Or you can just get cut gemstones and glue them in.  The ring blanks are less vintage-looking than I expected and more shiny.  They're kind of gaudy, but very fun for costume jewelry.  I got these ring blanks at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"Keeps ears nice and warm in cold weather, wife loves it."
5.0,like my pants
5.0,"i have been eyeballing this for a while and finally decided to purchase. soooooo... glad i did! the day i wore it, i got so many compliments. love it"
5.0,Good product for grandchildren
5.0,Fits perfect as expected
5.0,I Love this watch...its small enough to not bug me but not small enough to where you cant tell time.....best watch to buy
5.0,"I love Turbo Jam kick boxing, but this one really is wonderful in its own right.  I've tried almost all of the PowerStrike kick boxing workouts at one time or another (most are now unavailable unfortunately) and this one is my favorite.  The older PS workouts have you do all of the punching and kicking on one side before going to the 2nd side...it's extremely tiring.<br /><br />But this one, Ilaria changed it up so that you switch sides fairly frequently and therefore you don't get quite so tired!<br /><br />Chapter breakdown:<br />Intro<br />Warmup and Punches - 13 minutes<br />Kicks - 10 minutes<br />Combos, Blocks, and Cooldown - 25 minutes<br /><br />The chaptering could have been a smidge better near the end (separate chapter points for blocks and cooldown) but I didn't mind too much.<br /><br />Very fun, drill-style workout that I enjoyed so much I'm giving PS 4 another shot!<br /><br />I hope Ilaria continues to put out great kick boxing workouts like PS5!"
5.0,Very comfortable for my son.  He loved them and they were very good quality.  I will order another pair when he grows out of these.
5.0,"Better than expected! This is a must for anyone needing a few extra inches added to any silver chain. It is the perfect size and shiny and the clasp is easy to work. Yes, I would recommend this to anyone."
5.0,I love this mask! Could not survive the winter cold without it!
5.0,A nice soft quite warm jacket.
5.0,Purchased for a gift and it was even cuter in person. Fit perfect!
5.0,GREAT QUALITY!!
5.0,Super cute nice stretchy waist
5.0,"I love the look of traditional Aran knits, but sadly, am allergic to wool.  I have been on the search for an Aran scarf in a non-wool yarn, and am beyond thrilled to have found this one!  It's made from a mid- to heavy-weight acrylic and polyester yarn, knit with traditional Aran patterns in Ireland, and is absolutely beautiful, cozy and warm!  Exactly what I have been looking for - shipping was extremely reasonable, and arrived in the promised timeframe.<br /><br />I purchased this at FULL price, and did not receive any discount or other incentive for this review."
5.0,These Are The Same They Were In 1987..Too Bad Bad My Head Size Isn't But They Still Look Good.
5.0,I haven't used them yet for heavy exercise but they do work well for keeping my hair back out of my eyes.
5.0,We really like these masks.  They are very comfortable and easy to breath thru even though they are triple layered.  The colors are very nice also.
5.0,Love it perfect fit! I had been searching all over for these sunglasses and I just knew Amazon would have them.
5.0,LOVE IT. STILL HAVE IT. DURABLE. 👏🏼
5.0,Ghost wolf one
5.0,Exactly what I wanted -- a simple watch with a second hand. Zero bells and whistles. Perfect!
5.0,"I loved this outfit! I wasn’t sure how the top was going to fit but it seemed to me that one side was longer than the other. Since there are no tags at the top, I was able to decide what side I wanted to use. The material was light and stretchy and was perfect for my trip to Miami!"
5.0,Nice and clear with beautiful hints of yellow. Love the cream colored bag it came with. Will buy more.
5.0,"I purchased the small for my very petite college niece. The sizes run very small. I believe the small would fit a 10-12 year old petite small child. The Absolute Cult Customer Service team were AWESOME. They responding quickly and refunded my money (since I had already ordered another one in medium). It really is a pretty sweatshirt and perfect for the Star Wars fan. Since it was a gift, I don't know how it held up in the wash but I haven't heard anything so I assume all is well. So, the product itself gets 5 stars and Absolute Cult gets 5 starts. I would definitely order from them again. Only will know to go up in size."
5.0,"my daughters loved it but the shirts run small - my daughter is usually small or x-small and I got a medium and it fits slightly snug - the same for the large that I ordered, it was a just a little snug - order a size or two up unless form fitted is what you are going for,and then its perfect."
5.0,"I’m 5’7, 155 lbs and pretty flat chested two babies later and these work great for me. The pads are funky because they are one piece but I cut them in half and they do the job! I liked them enough for the price to order two orders."
5.0,"This jumper looked good on me. I’m about 5’7 220lbs, ordered a 2XThe material is really thin as far as showing skin imperfections like cellulite but a spans or something should hide that. The material stretches really well if you need it to. If I didn’t have the belly, I could have went down a size."
5.0,Friend and brother say very practical and comfortable. Look nice on them also
5.0,"I order many aprons over the years like this pinafore apron and was very disappointed in the length. They always pictured a woman with the apron falling below  the knees. When I tried it on, it was mid-thigh."
5.0,Same as advertised
5.0,"Very pretty and dainty.<br />I love the chain as well, it shimmers"
5.0,"Huge capacity and easy to see and find my cards, cash and receipts...plus it holds my iPhone 7 easily which is a huge bonus."
5.0,Love this! I got grey and green. Very very soft!!! Even have washed a few times and they did not pill up or fuzz out. So comfortable!!! I got a medium for me and the biggest size for my boyfriend haha we use them to run out to the hottub🙂

5.0,This is my second pair. I love them so much I wanted to have a spare because they're hard to find.
5.0,"I adore this dress!! Very strong, very cute, true to the size and image."
5.0,I'm 5'6 175lbs. I'm on the tall side. I wear a large and ordered a large and it still has a comfortable amount of room. Not to snug or too loose. Very true to size. Love it
5.0,"I am a C cup, at 5'2"", 130 pounds.  I got the large in white and it fit PERFECTLY.  Fabric was soft and very nice.  I also wanted to get the olive or tan but they are out of the Large, so I'll just rock my white jumper dress this summer!"
5.0,"This is a really cute bracelet, I like that it has an extension on it so you can adjust it to the size of your wrist. My daughter is going to love this, makes a great gift. It also comes with a cleaning cloth."

5.0,Comfortable and keeps feet warm!
5.0,"The dress shipped fast and easy, came in great condition. It fit perfect. Length is perfect and I’m 5’4. It’s a nice spring dress for events or parties. I would recommend this to others!<br /><br />I was sent this dress complimentary for reviewing purposes."

5.0,I love this bag it is perfect as a computer bag.
5.0,"Love the feel , I can breathe Easily while wearing it"
5.0,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a super-cute dress!  The shape is very feminine and flattering.  It is also stretchy so if you are wider in the back like me you can still move around.  The pleats below the empire waist help disguise a fluffy tummy.  The ruffles are perfect - the look elegant instead of goofy.  The V-neck is not too deep.<br /><br />I am 5'5"", 152 lbs and typically wear a size 10 in dresses.  This size 10 fits comfortably.<br /><br />The pink color of the dress is vibrant.  For some reason the ""rose"" color dress on the model looks almost purple on my computer.  However, it definitely has more of a dark pink tone in person."
5.0,These are really tight and I love them they help so much and are true to size.
5.0,i honestly never know what to expect when ordering online.. I love this scarf.  great quality & fit + fast shipping

It looks beautiful and elegant and is the perfect size for my 2 iPads Airs, Kindle and various accessories.<br /><br />WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THIS PURSE<br />• Beautiful, soft leather<br />• Strong hardware<br />• Multiple ways of carrying the purse (shoulder, hand, cross body)<br />• Perfect size for my needs<br />• Bottom has rivets to protect the purse<br />• Multiple zippered compartments<br /><br />The size is absolutely perfect for me.  Not so big that you can carry the kitchen sink, but not too small either.  Love this bag!<br /><br />* Purse received free of cost in exchange for my review"
5.0,Print + Quality is superb!! My husband received compliments the whole day. Runs a little large. Would definitely purchase from them again.
5.0,"This was heavy weight which was fine for December.  It also was snugger and shorter then I would have liked.  I like dresses right at knee and a little loose.<br />This sucked in everything, think shapewear so that was flattering.  I wore it to a wedding.  It was dressy enough."
5.0,Love it. Very pretty and flattering.  Happy I bought it.
5.0,These are adorable and super soft but they seem to be big girl sizes and I was looking for toddler size. I got size 4-6 and they are too big for my little one.
5.0,"These are super comfortable and I love the pockets.  I'm 5'3"" and they hit me mid calf."
5.0,"I live in FL and work outside at my job and at home constantly. I'm always looking for good quality dri-fit type shirts. This one is great. Fits as expected and very comfortable. The sleeves are a tad shorter than normal I think, but this labeled as a work out shirt so I guess the shorter sleeves are to show off your guns better? lol. Anyway, I would recommend this shirt"

5.0,Love it! Perfect fit
5.0,"I really like them because they are more out of the way and look better in my opinion than hanging reading glasses; also, the temples are long enough to avoid most smudging, which is nice. Good value for the money."
5.0,"I adore this handbag!!! It is perfect for the dress I am wearing to my nieces wedding!! I love Mary Frances!! 2nd bag purchase!! Trust me...you WILL NOT be disappointed!!!  Quality. glamour, beauty, sophistication....Just buy it!!! LOVE!!!"

5.0,"My daughter used her piggy bank money to get this watch.  She's quite happy with it.  She has a hard time switching the watch faces on her own, but it is easy to help her with.  She loves the memory game, the calculator, and camera - although it is pretty tough for her to get a clear one.... it makes the noise before it finishes taking the photo so she doesn't keep holding still.  Otherwise she seems happy with it."
5.0,"This is a smart looking bag that feels like a tough long lasting leather.  It contains three good size inside pockets.  One of these pockets has a zipper for added security.  There is also a detachable pouch(snaps) which can be used to carry your make-up items or credit/store cards. I like the weight of this bag as its not as heavy as some leather bags.  By the time you put your &#34;stuff&#34; inside  it is NOT too heavy.  I am amazed of the things this bag can carry.  I've used it for travel and carried camera, iPhone and iPad along with ALL my necessary stuff! This would be a great everyday bag  and I like the accessibility to get inside it.  This bag has a zipper that extends  over the ends of the bag and this makes it EASY to get inside. There is also a verticle zipper that provides a place for your keys-easy to get in or out. I chose the black/brown color with gold hardware and I think it is goes with any color in my closet.  It's easy to clean with a damp cloth which means it will always look great."
5.0,"feels good, i use these to play soccer"
5.0,"Love the the fit...the feel of the material, the length of the dress. My overall rating for this product is 5 stars & Yes, I will be ordering other colors."
5.0,"Perfect for flip flops!  I don't care what they look like, they are comfy and warm.  Perfect!"
5.0,"Everytime I wear this, I get compliments. I wish more dresses came with pockets. This is the perfect dress for Fall. Warm. Comfy."
5.0,"The plates were durable, cute and product came in a timely mannor"
5.0,My mom loves these!! She wears them all of the time!
5.0,I had a pair just like this and lost one.  Wore them all the time so I bought another pair.<br />Love them for daily wear because they go with everything.
5.0,Very happy with my purchases
5.0,"Original design with a quality to match, you guys over at Original Grain are doing a great job. Im very impressed in the craftsmanship. Making an affordable watch that turns the heads of the most high end watch enthusiast isnt easy and im grateful for it."
5.0,"This is a very pretty cover up. I love the color, the material is light and the stitching is strong. The only thing i would like to point out is that the sizing is a bit small for a one size. I wear anything between a small and a medium(size 6) 34c and it fit perfectly so if you are looking for something bigger or roomier then this might not be it."
5.0,Beautiful. Hubby loves it.
5.0,Thank you so much
5.0,These sunglasses are a timeless design that is very fashionable. They are well-made and durable. The lenses are very dark and really protect my eyes from bright sunlight and water or snow glare.
5.0,I got so many compliments and it was so flattering on me. I will say that I'm a 2x and wear a C cup and it was a tad small up there. But worked well for me.
5.0,I was really surprised that this is as nice as it is for the price. Great dress to go out in. Sexy but not slutty.
5.0,the style
5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised! I haven’t washed it, but so far it is true to size. I am 5’ 5” and around 150 with curvy hips; I normally wear a size 8 or medium in a dress, so that is what I ordered. It is a little shorter than what I usually wear, but not awful. It does have tendency to flap open at the bottom, so I’m not sure about that yet. Overall, though, it’s really flattering. Some have mentioned the low cut, but as I am not large chested, it isn’t a problem."
5.0,"Fits great! Looks great! If you believe in Ted Lasso (and I know you do), this is a tee that belongs on your chest. When I wear this out in public, at least seven people mistake me for Coach Beard (and I'm a woman!). Show your love & pride of Richmond! Get this! NOW!"
5.0,I have received so many compliments on this dress! Fast shipoing
5.0,This is actually the third pair I've purchased. A couple of friends loved mine so much that I surprised gifted them.
5.0,what can I say - perfect
5.0,This dress is Amazing. I bought a medium. I'm 5'3 145 and a 34dd. Most flattering dress I've bought while being sexy and classy. Warning though it is very very short on the right side.
5.0,I bought two of these one for myself and one for a friend and they are both so unique and beautiful.
5.0,"David Bowie is one of my favorite music artists. If I have to wear these things, I just as well have fun wearing them."
5.0,Fit very well and true to size.
5.0,5&#34;5 W155 a Medium fit prefect. It was the talk of the wedding Beautiful dress
5.0,I love everything about this hoodie. It came earlier than expected. It feels so soft and its not too thin and not too thick. The quality of the images are excellent. I love it
5.0,Granddaughters were tickled pink.
5.0,Great material and fits well
5.0,Perfect! But it!!
5.0,Excellent quality. Much better than over the counter cleaner.
5.0,Great gift for any potter fan!
5.0,It’s a little peachier in person but still very pretty.
5.0,"Came quite smushed but once I steamed and reshaped it, it was perfect!!"
5.0,I like the way these fit and I like the extra protection. The only drawback is they have to be hand washed.
5.0,These earrings are lightweight and beautiful!!!
5.0,Great price for a well made quality item. Love it!
5.0,I love the color and they are so soft...
5.0,"I was skeptical of the quality for the price, but was shocked to find it's actually a very stylish well built watch. Admittedly, I don't really wear watches and I use my phone to check the time, but this is stylish and make checking the time convenient. Considering I'm not hard to please, this watch is an amazing value.<br /><br />Cons: watch is difficult to adjust<br />Glass can be prone to scratching."
5.0,Nice &#34;gaggy&#34; knit cap . Well made with full coverage of your head.
5.0,Lovely dress.  Very comfortable
5.0,"A couple issues: it's a bit difficult to adjust the watch band size and the watch face picks up fingerprints and dust very easily. However, it's just as easy to wipe it clean, so that isn't too much of a challenge.<br /><br />Overall the watch is very stylish and would reccomend it even for daily use. Once the watch band is adjusted to desired tightness, it's easy to clasp."
5.0,Nice for costume jewlery.
5.0,Very comfortable. Going to order more!
5.0,My boyfriend loves them
5.0,My girl will love it!
5.0,"These mask are a great alternative to wearing a mask during the ongoing pandemic. They are comfortable and light weight. I hardly ever realize I'm wearing them. I also use these when I'm doing yard work, while wearing these my allergies dont flare up as much which is a win!<br />When it's time to wash usually wash it by hand. But you can also throw is in the washing machine to clean. I would reccomend these as an alternative for a mask."
5.0,"No too bold, but eye-catching. Enjoying this Ostan Men's bracelet."
5.0,Love the fit! I ordered 3XL (large boobs) I wish I ordered 2 XL. I received so many comments for my daughter birthday party. Definitely ordering again FAST SHIPPING
5.0,Love the boatneck!
5.0,My dad got a huge kick out of this shirt everyone laughs
5.0,"Good quality, super cute, it fits my daughter nicely"
5.0,Dainty and elegant
5.0,"This item is even better than advertised!  Most of my jewelry is solid gold, not plated,  and most of my stones are genuine, not lab created. This piece looks as nice as some of my fine jewelry pieces. Beautiful!!"
5.0,"The fabric is wonderful, washes up great."
5.0,"This handbag was absolutely beautiful!!! I LOVE a big bag!!! The quality and the smell were right up my alley. I enjoyed the purse a great deal, but unfortunately I had to return it because it was just too big, if there is a thing... Lol. I'm only 5 feet tall and the handbag was to my mid thigh. It was more long, than wide.  If you carry alot of stuff, this is your purse!!! If you love great quality and amazing customer service, buy this!!! The price is right for what you get."
5.0,Just what I needed. Better quality than I expected. I would highly recommend buying Botkier products through Amazon. I am thrilled.
5.0,"I have 2 of these now, and love them!  Wash & dry with no pilling.  So cute on!!"
5.0,Great fit. Comfortable. Very supportive. Would definitely buy again or recommend.
5.0,"I thought these would be over priced and as cheaply made as in the child section, but these are wonderful! Worth it! I get tired of slipping out of the bottoms of tunes as I've grown and the netting is strong too! I've bought small sturdy inflatable boats and put water in the bottom and that was great, but sometimes a tube is what you need! The connections to connect to ppl is a massive bonus since you don't need to pack rope lol I might buy two more in case I want to connect more ppl lol"
5.0,VERY PRETTY AND JUST THE RIGHT SIZE.
5.0,Received super quick and its gorgeous :)
5.0,"This is a great simple piece for any closet! Soft and comfortable fabric, is longer so makes it easy to tuck in or tie without it being too big in other areas!"
5.0,"Cotton, very cute."
5.0,I had been searching for this exact pendant. Love it and wear it daily!
5.0,"these extenders are just the thing to make your necklaces even more wearable with more outfits, allowing you to change lengths from choker, to mid-neck, and more. I needed just a teeny bit more give in a choker I'd bought and the rose gold extenders match it perfectly...and with the multiple sizes, I can adjust the piece now wear it now over the collar in addition to resting up at choker length. Really happy with this purchase."
5.0,Baby can’t stop wearing these socks.
5.0,"For a cheap Wayfarer-style pair of shades these are pretty nice! They’re comfortable and provide some much needed eye-comfort from the sun during daytime driving.<br /><br />Even cooler, it ships with an eyeglass screwdriver. I may have missed that in the product description, but it was a nice surprise."
5.0,I love the look of this umbrella and it is very sturdy and when you get in a car it keeps all the rain out because you could almost close the door fully before closing umbrella.<br />Love it
5.0,"The set arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  In fact, I was extremely impressed with the unexpectedly high quality construction.  The set was neatly packed, and included a money-back guarantee and 30 day warranty.  I was also very pleasantly surprised by an email about a week after receiving the set that described rules for flag football, as well as rules for several other games that can be played with the flags.  Very nice touch!"
5.0,Los escogí porque buscaba algo así de grande y los colores que tiene me encantaron. No son tan livianos como otros pero de igual manera me encantan.
5.0,Really nice jersey!
5.0,I love this.. fits perfectly.. I will purchase again
5.0,Awesome! Even better than expected. And one piece instead of two like previous cases I have purchased. True representation of the case in the description.
5.0,"this would be such a cute gift to give someone. It's packaged beautifully and is adorable on. For the price it looks great, gave this too my daughter (she's 5 years old) and she loves it."
5.0,"Don’t mess around with other bags.  This is the second one I’ve bought, one for myself and one as a gift.  Mine has held up beautifully through 3 football seasons and it’s the perfect size."
5.0,Great product. It’s a new trend .Birthday present for my 18 year old son. He loves them. I also have red and black.
5.0,Socks are great but the run a little small and have a tight fit
5.0,"Ironed up well...it's not lined and the fabric sort of is like the fabric my grandma used to wear, but the pattern and color make up for the fabric.  I really like this; it's not heavy at all. This is totally appropriate with white jeans, black tank and heels in summer, as well as black jeans and boots in the winter.  I sized up based on my experience that all amazon clothes run small and I shouldn't have."
5.0,Items arrived relatively fast. Very sturdy - still circular and holding up months later.
5.0,"My friend is all about Summer, and these were absolutely perfect!  She loved them!"
5.0,"Fits perfectly, very relaxing dress, I'm ordering more in different colors. I'm 5'8&#34; and the dress goes passed my ankles"
5.0,"Fits well, love that it is 100% cotton.  Very comfortable."
5.0,Color is true to the picture. I don't wear it but instead have it hanging from my review mirror.
5.0,My daugther loves it.....very comfy and cute
5.0,"This sticky bra stayed in place and the adhesive held all day! (96° plus humidity, 10 plus hours!) It's much easier to get a good adhesion if you wipe the breast area with rubbing alcohol to get rid of any body oils that might cause product to not stick. Easy to wash and reuse! Not the best design for some cuts of dresses as the tabs come up a little high, but PERFECT for a halter top! I will be trying different styles in the future!"
5.0,everyone love it
5.0,Very elegant  look beautiful
5.0,I'm going to enjoy these earrings.
5.0,Greta shirt. Medium is perfect fit. 5’6” 149lbs.
5.0,"The best sticky, strapless, bra I've ever tried. Holds up a double dd cup for more than a full day no problem. The only bra of this type that I've found to be truly &#34;ultra-lite&#34; as others I've tried have been too thick and heavy and makes your breasts look saggy, weird, misshapen. Mine has lasted for a few months now of medium use and I will likely be purchasing another. A must have for summer clothes and pieces you don't want bra lines showing."
5.0,"I always like to give out treats to trick-or-treaters, but now that I'm getting older most Halloween shirts just won't do. That's why this one worked and will continue to work for Halloweens to come."
5.0,Another pair of pretty earrings. I love these. I have worn them several times.
5.0,My granddaughter is 5 and she loves them and says they are soft and cozy. Plus her boots stay on better with them.
5.0,It’s a really cute bag!
5.0,Amazing pant. Super comfortable. I will recommend this product anytime
5.0,Love these earrings. I usually cant wear earrings in my first hole but these dont irritate my ears
5.0,Cute chokers - just way too large for a toddler. Adult size
5.0,Love it very spacious.
5.0,Bought them for my boyfriend. He likes them a lot. I think the lenses are sweet. It’s cool you can changed them.
5.0,"I rarely write a review, but had to do so with these shorts.  Ordered them for a beach vacation and wanted something to lounge and exercise in. They are light weight (big plus for suitcase weight) yet have a quality to the fabric.  Soft & silky to the touch plus I love the style and way they fit. I ordered a 3X and the leg style was straight yet roomy which gives a slimming affect to the body.  Nice, wide waistband which lays comfortably around the waist.  Will definitely order these again and highly recommend you give them a try."
5.0,It was absolutely beautiful and perfect except for figuring out how to attach to the high chair. That part wasn't very easy to do and had to spend additional money trying various attempts to stick.
5.0,Warm and soft. Great for wearing in the house. Not recommended under boots. Cannot mark product down because I did not read carefully enough but not what I needed.
5.0,Just the right weight as I was looking for - great to handle news print and not having ink on the paws anymore!
5.0,"Came promptly, in cute packaging, has extra ends.  Has a nice clean simple look, not obtrusive which is nice, since I did not want anything that would draw attention to it.  This will keep husband happy since I will not be looking for where I last left my reading glasses!"
5.0,Awesome belt! Simple and easy to use. Material is durable with infinite adjustability. Came in nice packaging. Would be a great gift.
5.0,"These earrings are so cute. I bought two pair. Large enough to make a statement, but lightweight."
5.0,I love these earrings
5.0,Very comfortable and flattering. I'm very satisfied with my purchase and out of the last four bathing suits ordered this is the first one that fits. HAPPY AND SATISFIED CUSTOMER!
5.0,"This is more beautiful in person! I got it for a Great Gatsby themed wedding, and it's perfect! I love it!"
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! The material is perfect for the fall temperatures. Its not thin. It fits me just as I hoped it would.
5.0,"Unfortunately many watches that come with poly straps have a tendency to dry out over time and crack and break.  Many of them are custom design straps you just can’t replace with a different one, or a different material like leather or steel.  My Invicta Sub Aqua III that I love suffered this fate recently and I was very upset thinking a replacement strap from Invicta could cost $50 or more.  Thanks to after market makers of watch straps like this one I was able to replace it with a brand new silicone strap at a fraction of the cost.  The change out took only 10 minutes with no tools.  I was able to switch out the white poly inlays and buckle very easily thanks to the soft pliable silicone.  Not to mention how black it looked comparing it to the old strap.<br />Not sure how long this strap will last but at least I know it can be easily replaced at a decent price.  I’m very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,"These are fun and fit a pair of mid-top throwback Jordan's perfectly. They look fresh and get compliments, like from my boss (&#34;You got that grape!&#34; etc.)"
5.0,"Amazing boots I've had for probably seven months now with virtually little to no signs of wear, order a size higher than your shoe size and you're all set my dude."
5.0,Nice quality and satisfied with the product.
5.0,"Very comfortable, I sometimes wear these for up to 10 hours per day with no problems. People with smaller faces might need to put a knot in the loops that go around the ears to have them fit properly."
5.0,"For the price I was absolutely skeptical. If these are your first pair of SPD's I highly recommend these. Comfortable, solid, fits as expected and the build quality seams like it will hold up. And if it doesn't, you're only out $50. Straps work great and they are very sturdy while still giving you a comfy Smit of play in the sole. Great pair of cycling shoes."
5.0,I got it for a relative and she loved it.
5.0,I like the price. Only thing that I don’t like is the rubber socks on the bows. Come off all the time
5.0,"Love them, they are so comfortable and absorbent."
5.0,Beautiful!  Thank you!
5.0,Good House shoes. Granddaughter loves them
5.0,Make sure to order a bigger size
5.0,Cute and definitely help as expected.
5.0,"Tired of boring old FJB cloth facemasks, or just tired of useless dictates?  Wear this stylish face covering instead!  A variety of colors for each occasion, fully covers nose and mouth, and stops just as much Omicron as any cloth mask from Nana."
5.0,It's adorable and it fits AS EXPECTED.  I actually bought it larger than I needed assuming it would be cut too small.  NOPE.  By the size you normally wear and you will be fine.
5.0,This dress is more than I expected. I ordered a small because I'm short and it is a flowing dress and long. It ne perfectly. Cotton feels good and looks Beautiful.
5.0,Heavier and larger but beautiful.
5.0,Beautiful dress--perfect fit and color chart was right on!
5.0,Love it....Exactly as described!!!
5.0,Upset kings
5.0,LOVE the color I get compliments all the time! If you want a stiff sided purse this is for you if not don't get it! I love it
5.0,Fine socks. went on feet.
5.0,"These are my new favorite socks. It will take a lot for another pair of socks to take their place as my favorite. They are just what I was hoping fore. They look exactly like the picture and are rather tightly knit, so I have a feeling that they will last a while, I sure hope they do! Plus, it's pretty cool that they're made from recycled/reused yarn/cotton."
5.0,nice job
5.0,"It fits perfectly, so I ordered another one ;-)."
5.0,"The product arrived promptly, the stamping on the bracelet looks good and the magnets are securely embedded in the copper.<br />I never take it off and the only time my wrist got that coppery green look was when I was outside working and sweeting a lot."
5.0,Love these - I most definitely will be ordering a second pair.
5.0,This is a great hat! It's very heavy duty so it will hold up but with the side vents the heavy duty nature of the hate won't leave you miserably hot. I tend to be unable to ware anything other then trucker hats in the heat because my head starts to itch from sweating. This hat has more then the typical vent hole grommets it has full mesh venting which makes a world of difference and allows me to use it. I also prefer it over a baseball style cap because it covers your ears. While I received a discount on this one I'd gladly purchase it again.
5.0,"Looks very nice and is very high quality for the price. I'm not sure how much of it is real leather and what grade the leather is, but that's not too important to me. The yellow stitching pops and looks really nice. I did notice one of the yellow threads pulled a bit after not having it for too long, but it's not very noticeable, and the overall quality seems to be pretty durable."
5.0,This purse is roomy. The color is great and the I like the ability of using the handles or shoulder strap whichever is needed.
5.0,"So. Cute. I'm 5,8 160lbs size B cup, the large fits perfect. Would look really nice on a bustier woman as well."
5.0,"Elastic is very flexible, so it sometimes shifts so the buckle piece is crooked but otherwise great."
5.0,The softness is a good thing and a bad thing I had to starch and iron some of them to get them to stay up on the Tips/ends.  But it works that way.  Otherwise the masks are amazing they’re super soft and they fit my face good. Great for the price
5.0,I love this bag.  It is a perfect size.  Thanks
5.0,Loved this for my nephew. Bought his the bigger size when he grew out of the first one.
5.0,"These fit perfectly. Bought my normal size, didn’t have to size up or down. They are very comfortable and have not shrunk at all. Will definitely buy more!"
5.0,I bought these for my teenage daughter and she loves them! Very comfortable and stylish! A great bargain too!
5.0,Help with my tired visión when working with the computer and on my cell phone. No more headaches after using computer too long
5.0,"I have hawthorn trees and thorny vines growing wild that I have to trim back every year and then carry those trimmings to my burn pile. Because they are so entangled with other things after I trim them I sometimes have to pull them out which means numerous punctures to my hands using regular garden gloves. So far these gloves have eliminated that problem. I can't say how long they will hold up, but if I get one growing season out of them, I will be happy."
5.0,This tutu is ridiculously cute! I got it for my daughter's Halloween costume but I'm sure she's going to be wearing it around for months to come. It seems to be pretty good quality and the elastic is great so I'm sure it fits a wide variety of body sizes. It is somewhat see through in the light but it isn't a deal breaker for me personally.
5.0,I love this shirt! It has become my favorite thing to wear! It has a thick soft fabric that is a rich fiery red with a tinge of orange. The material that the rabbit is made out of appears to be chiffon but I don't know fabrics too well. The sleeves are lovely but keep in mind that this shirt is supposed to fit loosely on your frame and the sleeves have extra fabric at the armpit. This isn't your regular long sleeve shirt but I love it.
5.0,Nice on my daughter. She wore to a Jr high event.
5.0,Love these plugsď
5.0,"This thing is definitely class. Easy to put on, easy off. Looks great, Don't want to hide it under a long sleeve."
5.0,I like your product - maximises the use of natural fibre.
5.0,"My daughter love it, overall good quality and hope it last a long time."
5.0,I bought a few of these for my husband.  He works out a lot and needs to have something to stop sweat from trickling down his face. These particular skull caps have a little band of extra absorbent material right along the forehead.  These are the only ones I will continue to buy.  They work great.
5.0,Its a large size and wonderful for cold rooms or auditoriums. I like it.
5.0,A little snug in the arms so I recommend ordering a size up. I wear a belt at the natural waist line and get many compliments on this. I have it in 3 different colors.
5.0,Well made and easy to clean. Recommended
5.0,"These LED light shoes are really cute.  I like the Chuck Taylor, Converse type look of these shoes.  The upper is a multi color fabric with pink, green, and blue colors.  The toe of the shoe, the sole, and the shoe strings are white.  The LED lights are charged with a USB cord.  The charge lasts 8 to 10 hours approximately.  The color and blinking combinations are numerous.  Great purchase.  Thanks."
5.0,The BEST for the price you will find nothing better
5.0,The colors are most vibrant but I am waiting myself on feedback of wear. They are all presents.
5.0,Adorbs!!! Fits great.
5.0,This hat is very warm and very well made. It is slouchy and fits very comfortable. It is definitely a good purchase!
5.0,"This 5 pack of coil wristband key chain set is great! They are made of high quality material, durable, and great value for the money. Each wristband comes with a metal keychain to add keys. The coils are flexible, durable and when stretched they go back to the original size and shape. I highly recommend this versatile keychain."
5.0,Es un regalo
5.0,Amazing!! Bought as a bridesmaids dress and love it.
5.0,everyone at work liked the hat
5.0,A great buy.  Good quality and very eye catching.  Thanks.
5.0,beuatiful
5.0,"Excellent product. Does not tarnish or change color in any way, no matter what you get on it. (Salt water, etc) just soap and water, and looks brand new. Will purchase more from this seller."
5.0,This wig is amazing fits on my head just right with no problems
5.0,My son loves the outfits for football
5.0,Really cute and sparkly. Wears and washes well.
5.0,Perfect for a beach trip and all summer long! these sunnies are so great im loving them!
5.0,It is just that precious. Recomended 100 % ...
5.0,Had the belt for about 18 months now and wear it 4-5 days a week for 12+ hours and I love it. It still looks great and hasn't stretched hardly at all. If you wear heavy jeans it doesn't hold them up like a leather belt will though.
5.0,Love these pj's.  Bought a 2nd pair as a gift for a friend!
5.0,"Es de buena calidad la tela, y buena terminación"
5.0,Love these pajamas.Good quality flannel. Very warm and comfortable on a cold night. Well worth the price.
5.0,This watch is beautiful and exactly what I wanted. Not a huge face and looks just fancy enough
5.0,I love this top. it is simple and comfortable to wear. I love the black detailing on the front.
5.0,I really like this suit and my fiance says they are HOT! She says the suit is &#34;sexy&#34; and definitely a bit skimpy but I feel it covers enough that I don't feel it is tacky. The suit is made of nice quality material and I think it is an excellent value for the money. It shipped quickly and I had to wait only a short time to receive it. This is currently my favorite suit and I give a thumbs-up vote and strongly recommended.
5.0,"This is one of my three favorite sweaters. It’s reasonably priced, looks great on both the hanger and me, Is true to size, washes well (I use a garment bag in my regular eco warm wash cycle), oh, and it’s the perfect length. If you think I like it, mission accomplished!!! PS I wear an XL."
5.0,I was extremely happy with the material and quality of this bathing suits. I have purchased some expensive bathing suits from everything but water and quality of this bathing  is the same. Im am 5.3 and about 138 lbs  and bathing suit fits very nice . a little sexy but not too much . love it !!
5.0,best PanterA t-shirt ever!
5.0,"Bought this white Roc Mens Bodywear Tank for my son. It was pretty snug (supposed to be) but it did fit. He's a tad on the husky side right now so figured this would be good for him. He weighs 195 lbs and he's five foot seven and we bought the XL. He uses it regularly as an undershirt for work. Be sure to wash before wearing the first time because his was itchy pre wash. After washing the shirt he had no issues with it being itchy, he has sensitive skin. I didn't notice a big difference probably more slight in his appearance for his weight or tummy but he likes it so I am happy with it.<br />This tank was given to me for free in order to try it and write a review here based on my 100% honest & unbiased opinion."
5.0,"It is an impressive time piece.  Very stylish, low profile and keeps precise time."
5.0,"Color is off a little from the pictures, but good for what I wanted it for."
5.0,They look exactly as shown and fit as usual. Also received this earlier than expected :)
5.0,"The ring is very beautiful. Be aware that the gem inside of the infinity rose design is actually &#34;suspended&#34; and moves, for extra added pop. There was a hiccup in shipment, and it was addressed right away. Great customer support!"
5.0,Soft and stretchy.  Love the fit .
5.0,"fast delivery, came as shown, decent quality for the price. the woman loves it"
5.0,It is so cute. Even down to the pink shoes.
5.0,Jawns cheap
5.0,"Very easy to open, had no problems with it, and I loved it. It was definitely what it was described."
5.0,The hat fit great and keeps me warm! Olaf is my favorite character from the movie! They got the Olaf carrot nose perfect in this hat!
5.0,So comfortable! I am definitely going to be ordering some more in different colors!
5.0,"These laces are identical to the NB laces that came with the shoes. I changed the color from blue to white.<br />These are that nice, flat, tube kind of lace. They look great."
5.0,"These socks are exactly what I need during the winter months. Soft, cozy, warm, just the right amount of elastic (not too tight but keeps the sock top in place), they come in neutral gray/white, light gray and black colors.  They look more on the expensive side, I'd say.<br /><br />I wear them with Birkenstock sandals in the winter. Beats any houseshoes I've found for arch support, warmth, and cushion on our hard-wood floors.<br /><br />I wash in cold and line dry, though they'd probably do fine in regular wash and the dryer."
5.0,I’ve always had a hard time with headbands fitting and being comfortable. This one is super comfortable and keeps hair and sweat out of my face during a workout. The fabric is luxuriously soft. Would purchase again.
5.0,"Great items, plastic coating can come off after a not of use but does not affect quality. Actually looks better with a matte finish underneath."
5.0,"I love this Elvis Presley large tote bag, The King White Jumpsuit.  It is a good quality. Thank you."
5.0,It's very comfortable and cute. I can't wait to get one for my kid so we can match.
5.0,Very nice fabric
5.0,"The socks were exactly as portrayed in their description.  Good quality, non slip.  And delivered on time.  I recommend buying this product if you are looking at it."
5.0,"I got a small and even then it’s sliiiiightly too big in the hips for me BUT I tossed a belt on and I’m like “Oh, ok then, you convinced me, fabric, you get to stay in my closet.”<br /><br />So now I’m keeping it and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase!<br /><br />P.S. Yes - it does have pockets."
5.0,"Honestly, I didn't expect much for the price but so far am really happy with this wallet.  I can even get my Samsung Note 4S in it without the case on.  Nice bonus.  Thank you so much."
5.0,"Excellent quality, accurate to description and advertised pictures. Comfortable and durable."
5.0,This passes the candle test.  Just wish it had a nose piece
5.0,Fits our doll perfectly.  Delivered as advertised.  We are happy.
5.0,i give 5 stars since i bought without paying attention to the fact they are a narrow boot. they would be comfortable for me (wide foot) if they were wider.. but good quality and price
5.0,good quality. looks great.
5.0,Love this shirt! Very comfy & cute
5.0,"I love this ring. It is beautiful.  It is rather big, so make sure you like clunkier jewelry.  It is a rich beautiful color of red. Matches my red clothes really nicely.  Good quality."
5.0,Although this piece is costume jewelry every time I wear it I get so many compliments.
5.0,"Great fabric. Real cotton, not that clingy polyester material. Fit true to size, but could be roomier in the bust. Long enough for me. I’m 5’4”. Great color, true to picture."
5.0,"These socks are higher quality than I was expecting. They're soft, and stay above the knees. Perfect for a retro roller skating date"
5.0,Very good for very low price.
5.0,Gave me a little extra

5.0,Fits as expected for size and wears and looks good

5.0,A little stylish and elegant. Glad I got this dress. Wore it it this week and couldn't stop getting compliments. Fits like a glove. Really loving it.
5.0,Awesome!!!!
5.0,Small and simple to cary
5.0,"Yellow is my granddaughters favorite color, so this was a no brainer.. Very well made and she loves it"
5.0,"This is my new favorite watch. Feels expensive and all the dials work. If people are paying $130 for MVMT watches and this thing is only $20, they're being ripped off."
5.0,"I would suggest to get one size larger. So if you are really a size small, order a medium.  Very comfortable and soft material. Good quality."
5.0,"Best underwear available. I don’t wear anything else. They keep their shape, don’t stretch out and last for years."
5.0,cute and functional
5.0,"Soft material, very strong stitching and well made, with a great price! Cant go wrong with these! Buy them!!"
5.0,U absolutely love it I just wish that it came without replacement filters

5.0,GREAT HAT
5.0,"Love the length of the dress, not too short. The Herringbone pattern is beautiful and very unique because of the sequin material. Great holiday dress!"
5.0,So cool. A little snug for my 9 year old but a really good quality mask.
5.0,I love this Hat! Got all kinds of compliments on it. Recommend every woman needs to own a few.
5.0,"Outstanding quality.  I found this dress on Amazon, listed by CosplayDiy. I was hesitant at first because they only had one review.  The review was 5 stars so I ordered the dress. I promptly received an email from Cosplay asking for measurements.  Pinky even emailed back when a measurement didn't seem right to him.  He was right, I had given him the wrong measurement.  The costumer service was fantastic.  I also ordered the Mary Poppins blue skirt and jacket, the red coat, and Bert's Jolly Holiday striped suit. All the costumes are outstanding."
5.0,"this dress is amazing! It is exactly what I have been looking for! The dress fits amazing and has a little stretch to it so even if I gained a little it would still fit. I could probably even wear this in the first few months of a pregnancy. The material isn't heavy enough to make me sweat, but isn't too light where I need a slip. the cut of the dress is super flattering for a little postpartum pudge and I love it."
5.0,These were great gloves for the price.  Arrived right away so we used them on our ski trip.  Thank you.
5.0,I was very pleased with the quality of this prayer shawl.
5.0,"I was seriously shocked by how nice these scarves are! Awesome price! They are soft, colors are true to the picture, and they are cute. My daughter and I both love them. I would definitely buy more in other colors."
5.0,No complaints. It's exactly what I thought it would be. Comfortable.
5.0,"I bought these after moving to a tiny town in Central Texas and realizing the nearest full grocery store was in the next town over.  In the summer, the car can get very hot even with a/c running, and frozen items were starting to melt before I could get them home.  Bought these, and they are fabulous!  I pack all the cold items in them in the store, and they stay frozen and cold the whole way home, even when making a pit stop for gas.  Highly recommend to all my friends (and anybody reading this review!)"
5.0,"Very beautiful.  The stones are colorful (as pictured) and the workmanship is perfect.  My daugter said she loved them, so I‘m happy.  I should have gotten 1 for myself.  Good price and delivered quickly."
5.0,Warm and a great fit
5.0,"So I have 2 of thier jackets and a hoodie and a beanie, very happy with the products you sell! Thank you I wear my jackets to work here in Seattle. A t-shirt and my jacket is all I need!"
5.0,"I loved it all. If I had to put one thing down, it was that I ordered a larger size and the stomach area ended up being a little small.<br />Ended up losing weight anyway, but LOVE IT!!"
5.0,LOVE THESE GLASSES !
5.0,"Very soft, comfortable sweatshirt that washes well. Easy to dress up with a scarf or necklace. Love it!"
5.0,"Love the color and the size is just right. Plus, great price!"
5.0,I used these to put around my children's cups as a sort of label. They know what color is theirs each day and it has helped cut back on the amount of cups I wash every day. I love these bracelets and the colors have helped up great through months of washing. Highly recommended this product!
5.0,"If you want to cosplay Kabuto Yakushi, Haise Sasaki, Harry Potter, or Mey-Rin, these are the right glasses to buy. They're huge, but they look good. They're durable and don't have too bad of a glare. They fit comfortably, but I've only worn them for short periods of time. A good buy for cosplay."
5.0,LOVE it was a little big. I wear a large usually so I had to send back and go a size down and it was perfect!
5.0,Love it! So so cute.
5.0,"I will be wearing this to the new Christopher Robin movie next month! Love it, great quality!"
5.0,"Excellent tire tools. I bought this almost a year ago and I didn't use them until the other day. I bought a $5 tube to replace the one in my friends bike since he had a flat tire due to some glass. These definitely came in handy, not bad for under $2!"
5.0,Very good product. My husband loves it.
5.0,I love this waist trainer. Helps alot. I just hate that it's starting to rip on the inside. I've only had it a couple of weeks
5.0,Love this product
5.0,Feels cheap and very synthetic.  Too small compared to other brands
5.0,I purchased the Everrich Flower Wide Rhinestone Chocker ( black) for an event and am completely satisfied. It looks stunning on and received a thousand compliments. Very comfortable and looks amazing on! Thank you!
5.0,"Love all things Nygard! Best pants and tops I gavw ever worn hands down. This man was a genius with the way his pants would suck in a the fat and make you look and feel sexy. Too bad they are out of business. I bought every pair of pants and tops I could afford on sale. Love, love, love them."
5.0,Got it for my daughter. Its one of her favorite pieces of jewelry.
5.0,Great Product as usual and more than expected thanks for your fine leather goods and hope to buy more soon .

5.0,Seems 1/2 size smaller but definitely what I was looking for. Great quality.
5.0,"I love this sweater! I usually wear a large and it fit perfectly. The material is heavy and the pattern continuity at the seams is flawless. Overall I am pleased and the quality is much nicer than I expected for $30. Bravo!<br /><br />Styled with dark Heather shift dress, Heather tights and over the knee black boots with gold accents."
5.0,"I have a small waist & bigger butt, most leggings fall & I have to keep pulling them up but not these ! Had to send first pair back bc of whole but got my second & they are great !"
5.0,Me encantaron super bonitas y la calidad ni se diga
5.0,"I really like this blouse!  It is a soft , lightweight chiffon, but it is not completely see through.  It is loose and drapey, with the back slightly longer than the front. Seams are all serged (double stitched),  This is a great summer shirt that I can get away with wearing to work!  I received this at a discount in return for an honest review, and I can honestly say I am happy with what I got!"
5.0,There great!
5.0,The Cuff bends a bit for ease of fit. Pretty silver tone. The Scroll pattern is the feminine touch I wanted.
5.0,I liked it fit great

5.0,I love these emblems. I have ordered several so far. I use them on military crosses I make and the quality is awesome. I
5.0,"Great size! Not large, but it fits everything I need. It is wider than it is tall, so I can find things easier. It also stands up, which is nice. The outside pockets are useful."
5.0,Super soft and washes up well. Great product!
5.0,Have cataracts and headlights look like starbursts driving at night uncomfortable. These glasses really work cuts the glare of oncoming headlights.
5.0,Love these socks! Soft and warm and excellent quality!
5.0,They're beautiful! I thought they'd be smaller so I was pleasantly surprised when they were the same size as pictured! My mother and mother in law will both love them
5.0,[[VIDEOID:e91a46e6a19f8675074dba017f40a931]] I really enjoy myTommy Jean I feel smart and gentle
5.0,"These glasses are spot on for the strength, nice looking and the price is wonderful. Thinking about getting a second set. I used to get 4 for 20 at Sams and this beats it hands down."
5.0,Perfect for year round comfort
5.0,"These work great for me! I have a 32"" waist and 39"" hips and I was struggling to find the right fit. I got the Large.<br />I bought the top separately and I really like that I was able to order my bra size which was spot on as well."
5.0,"Besides running a little on the narrow side they’re awesome , I love them."
5.0,great idea to put a hood on workout shirts!!
5.0,"Great socks, nice and comfy."
5.0,"Super cute, comfortable, get compliments all the time"
5.0,Bought this for renaissance fair because it was going to be cold and raining. It really helped. Kept me dry until it had been raining a few hours. Definitely helped keep me warm. It’s not too thick as to be heavy or too hot. It’s really nice. I can also wear it in the winter time in real life because it’s so nice.
5.0,Cute sweater. Love the design and the cute of the bottom of the sweater. I always get compliments when I wear PattyBoutik tops to wear to work. I now own 11 winter tops and 4 summer tops and will be ordering more. I have never been disappointed in anything I have ordered.
5.0,I've written my review allready.
5.0,"I felt amazing in this dress. I usually wear a size 20 and I got a 3X, I was so nervous to buy a gown offline and I was in a jam with the wedding nearing fast. I received so many compliments on this gown and it was very comfortable to dance and sit in! Get it, you will love the way you look!"
5.0,Love these glasses. Blocks a lot of glare and gives great shade when driving.
5.0,My new gray Asics shoes came with garish pinkish fuchsia laces. These match the gray on my shoes perfectly.  I ordered a bit shorter than the ones that came with the shoes. Perfect length for my size 8 women's shoes.
5.0,I love them!  They make me smile and my nose is happy too!
5.0,"Wow! These are NICE!! The gray is a very nice clear color, the fit is perfect (not easy as I am small) and the fabric stretches and then retracts to it's former shape immediately. I hope they continue to perform over time and washes because I will be wearing these a LOT!! :))"
5.0,"I love the cap,I would have loved to have a black one also. Lightweight but strong"
5.0,My boyfriend and I love them.
5.0,So cute and comfy.  Fabric is very soft. You can dress it up with a nice necklace. I bought a xs and I'm 5 ft 109 lbs. Perfect length!
5.0,"These are better than I was expecting them to be. The build quality is solid. They are light, but sturdy. They definitely don't feel like cheap sunglasses, and they don't look like it either. Don't get me wrong, they won't pass for premium shades, but they're not your typical gas station sun glasses either. Bottom line: you can't go wrong for the price. I'll probably be ordering a backup pair soon."
5.0,"I am 72 years old and ordered these earmuffs for myself. They provide good protection. They fit rather snug but that was to be expected because they are advertised for kids, but they can work for an adult."
5.0,Love it thank you ! :)
5.0,Simply love them
5.0,The fabric is lovely.  Fit is flattering.  A new fave!
5.0,"Above expectations! For $8 I wasn't expecting much, but it's great quality and exactly what I was wanting!"

5.0,Yup antlers and a red nose!!

5.0,Bought it for my dad and he loves it<br /><br />*He knows about ties and its quality*
5.0,Love the sweatshirt.  Very cozy.  I couldn't decided what color to get so I bought 2. One green and the other rose.  This would make a great gift for the woman who is cold all the time.
5.0,"I am 5'3&#34; and 170 lbs. The XL fits perfectly. The material, though a bit sheer, is high quality. Really like the waistband as it covers my stomach without feeling suffocating. They are the perfect length for me but I think if you were any taller than about 5'5&#34; they might be too short for you."
5.0,"This is a wonderfully unique hand bag....They are attractive, durable and would make a great gift for most women."
5.0,Great fall pins! Good quality!
5.0,My husband is on his feet all day and has started to have leg issues from standing. It got so bad he couldn’t sleep at night. We ordered these and he now wears them all the time. While he still has legs issues from time to time they have really helped!
5.0,"Love these socks. Ordered the smaller of the two sizes (I'm a size 9 shoe) and they fit, but I would order the larger size next time."
5.0,"The item actually arrived on 5/19, even though it wasn't suppose to arrive until June 4 at the earliest. While the pendulum itself was beautiful, I was a little sad that it did not have many copper flecks going through it, but as a natural stone it is next to impossible to control how it will look as the final product. The blue, a nice deep blue, is nicely marbled with the white in it. They were even nice enough to send a tree pendant as a gift with my order."
5.0,"Fit's perfectly.  I am 5' 1"", 110 lbs and ordered a size small."
5.0,Gave this as a gift for Christmas. My sister loved it.

5.0,I loved this product cause it represents history!
5.0,"It's my husband's newest best hat - cozy, comfortable and soft."
5.0,"These low cut ankle socks are comfortable, fit well, and are ideal for casual wear in warm weather. I was pleased to see this type of low cut sock in brown as usually stores don't have this style of sock in that color. They feel comfortable and the fabric is lightweight though not overly thin. I am pleased with this pair of socks."
5.0,Very good cuhh
5.0,Gave as a gift and she loved it. True red color. Rolls up easily just like it said in the description.

5.0,Great Strong Bag Love it...
5.0,love it wish they make postal blue I wear mine I am a letter carrier it helps me
5.0,For now I love how it doesn’t retain water like my other slippers I’m throwing away. Only time will tell if I keep it.
5.0,Nice! I like it/
5.0,"Husband loved this gift. He was very pleased with colors and design, great watch!"

5.0,"Good quality, Med fits as expected, Color matches picture."
5.0,"I LOVE these earrings.  I grew my hair longer during COVID and had to change the length of my earrings because my hair is now long and thick.  I needed something that would show that I was wearing earrings even though my hair was long.  Not only are these really beautiful and shiny gold, but they have become my favorites.  Lots of wonderful comments on them!"
5.0,Fits perfectly and is easy to surf in.
5.0,Small nice price
5.0,"I love the quality of the socks and the rubber grips. I'm a size 7, and it fits great!"

5.0,"I wish there was more fabric like the original dress, but for the price, I'll take it! It is a little scratchy on the arms, but it doesn't bother me."
5.0,"Comfortable to wear all day. I work at laundrymat, so it's perfect. Love it!"
5.0,"This necklace is so lovely, especially at this price point. It is a little heavy but I wore it for a few hours and it didn't bother me. You can feel the weight but it's not cumbersome. It looked great with my sleeveless striped turtle neck!"
5.0,"Using it for my prom dress, can’t wait!"
5.0,"I bought the red one.  I love the embroidery done with the eagle.  I coach flag football.  We were the Eagles last season when we won the championship.  I'm a patriot at heart (and a Patriots fan).  We will probably be the Eagles this season again so I figured this cap will serve two purposes - show my national pride and the team's identity.  I would have liked it to fit a little ""lower"" around the head than it does - like a quarter inch or so all the way around but it does fit well, looks great.  You know you've bought something cool when your wife can't stand to go out with you wearing it. :-)  Would buy again."
5.0,Needed for a vintage look as a docent in a 1920's home.
5.0,This was a gift for my husband and he likes how it fits and feels.
5.0,Snug where they need to be and they give where they need to. I love these underpants.
5.0,"Visor arrived on time and was well packaged. Very bright, shiny sequins."
5.0,Very cool and the lights were bright! All the modes are unique and eye catching. The battery pack inside mask is a little uncomfortable
5.0,"Very pretty necklace, and it looks great."
5.0,"These are awesome sandals.  I wear them with or without socks.  They don't slide on my feet and they have some arch support so they dont' wear out my feet.  I would highly recommend them, especially for people who can't wear or don't like flip flops."
5.0,"very sleek, minimal, low profile watch. no numbers on face make this more of a dress watch in my opinion but could certainly be worn everyday. strap is comfortable and functions fine. love the low profile and low weight watch its makes you almost forget your wearing it. east to read dial. hope it lasts a long time really like it."
5.0,Works great in my nose
5.0,Super cute 2 piece! I’m a thicker gal so I ordered a 2x. the material is very stretchy and breathable! Perfect outfit for a day at the winery with the girls 🧡 Will definitely be buying in different colors!
5.0,"I love this band, very colorful and comfortable. It brightens my day."
5.0,Its looks good
5.0,These shoes are so cute & comfy!  I am a size 8 & ordered the size 39.  They fit perfectly!

5.0,"Loose fitting and good quality material. Fits like a US medium! Live in it every time it's clean again, during summer."
5.0,Love this sleep dress; good fit and good fabric
5.0,My husband loved this watch!
5.0,I have about 20 pairs of these pants - multiple pairs in all colors.  They wash and wear beautifully.  I work in a legal office and they are perfect in a professional setting.  I've had mine for 10 years and they look brand new.  I wear cuddle duds under them in winter so I don't have to buy winter slacks.  Saves me money having one year round wardrobe - just don't wear white in winter and add the cuddle duds!  Love them.
5.0,Fantastic product
5.0,Mom loves it.
5.0,This shirt is a nice flowy material and fits as expected.
5.0,Exactly what I expected and sent on time!!!

5.0,It was a perfect fit and beautiful colors too❤️
5.0,Bought this shirt for my husband and he loved it! Only thing i would recommend is to hang dry the shirt so that the lettering on the t shirt doesnt crack  so quick. Other than that it was perfect!
5.0,Dress was very beautiful and good finality. Would recommend a size bigger due to the lace adjustable back but other than that it was stunning.
5.0,Fit just right I'm 5'8 110lbs and the small was perfect. This material is however quick to catch lint and animal hair though so be sure to have a lint brush.
5.0,It was nice i jst didnt want it i was afraid the black will fade but good quality hoodie n they were nice to give me back my refund great company hope to see some neon colors

5.0,"There's only one word to describe a band like Gojira and that one word is incredible. These guys are certainly without a doubt one of the most creative, unique and original bands in the metal genre today. Their 2008 release, &#34;The Way of All Flesh&#34; is an amazingly stunning and powerful work of pure, hypnotic grooving progressive/death metal that is dare I say just as powerful as the band's name itself. The first thing that I must have to say is that the music on this album here is just incredibly breathtaking and extremely heavy hitting throughout. The songwriting and musicianship is just supremely tight here with the guitars, bass and drums all playing in perfectly intricate formation throughout. Each track here is just chock filled with crushingly heavy and powerful riffs, plodding bass lines, amazingly balanced drumming, and intensely powerful vocals throughout. The production value here on TWOAF is also very outstanding and crystal clear as well, and also another thing that I would like to point out on what also makes Gojira incredible are the lyrics that they write which are very poetic and thought provoking, dealing with topics such as nature, environmental issues, spirituality, life and death, the redeeming possibility of pain and suffering, and the necessity of introspection. The vocals of Joe Duplantier are just intense, powerful and harsh, yet very clear simultaneously that you can actually hear and understand what he is saying which is a good thing. I really like how Joe pours out every single ounce of emotion and power in his growls, screams, and cleans throughout this album. Meanwhile, the guitar work of Joe and Christian Andreu is in absolute fine form throughout as they both bust out a supremely impressive batch of immensely powerful and heavily crushing, hypnotic, brain-hammering riffs through one track after the next, and they also tend to make great usage of tremolo picking riffs, as well as pinch harmonics and pick sliding techniques too especially on cuts such as &#34;Adoration for None&#34;, &#34;Esoteric Surgery&#34; and &#34;Wolf Down the Earth&#34;. Elsewhere, bassist Jean-Michel Labadie delivers awesomely solid, plodding bass lines that are like a massive earthquake, and of course drummer Mario Duplantier (whom is also Joe's brother) rounds things off with his ever-so incredibly mind-boggling work behind the drum kit as he dishes out everything from heavily deft and pounding, stomping double bass beats, massive cymbal crashes, wicked fills, and everything else in between. Seriously, this guys is like a human octopus behind those drums, I mean he is just downright amazing. Mario is definitely one of metal's best drummers today, no questions asked.<br /><br />Kicking off the album, we have &#34;Oroborus&#34; which is an amazingly mind-boggling opener that is highlighted by some addictingly infectious and hypnotic, technical, finger-tapping harmonic riffing, plus some meticulous and complex drumming, and awesome growls from Joe to boot, plus he also throws in some nice melodic vocals around the 2:41 mark as well. The song is also capped off by some scintillating ambiance in the end as well. And amazing opening track, but that is just the beginning. The second track, &#34;Toxic Garbage Island&#34; is another huge highlight that is bolstered by a ferocious slugfest of pummeling machine gun-like power chords and double bass blasting before settling into a more steady and slower paced progression of amazingly hypnotic riffing and great drumming, and the song is also highlighted by more of Joe's heavy and intense growls and roars throughout. Meanwhile, the album's third track, &#34;A Sight to Behold&#34; showcases a more experimental side of Gojira as the song features some catchy, groovy synth lines, and mesmerizing robotized sounding vocal deliveries from Joe Duplantier which really give this song a slightly different edge than most songs here. The song also includes some more infectiously catchy harmonic tapping riffage, plus the song also gains heaviness as the song progresses with more blistering, churning, machine-gun-like riffs and double-timed drums, and harsh growls and shouts. Another amazing track, I love it. Next up, we have track four, &#34;Yama's Messengers&#34; which is a monstrous, skull-crusher of a song that is anchored by a heavily mammoth, crushing mathematical groove, and also features massive, pounding, brain-smashing riffs that are just pound your skull like a hammer, along with heavy, ear-rumbling bass lines, and hefty, blistering, thunderous double bass drums (with some punishing blast beats included) and thundering cymbal crashes as well.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the following cut, &#34;The Silver Chord&#34; is a nice short, little atmospheric and mellow instrumental piece that gives the listener a break from the sheer brain-crushing heaviness before leading right into the following song, &#34;All the Tears&#34; which of course brings the heaviness right back, as it features yet more massively heavy, earth-shaking, cranium-crushing riffage, plus some cool pinch harmonics, along with some ringing and beeping bass lines, and busy, lightning-quick double bass pedal slamming, as well as some floor-shaking blast beat sections, plus more of Joe's savage and powerful screams and howls throughout to boot. Moving forward following that, we have track seven and another huge high point on the album, &#34;Adoration for None&#34; which features guest vocals from Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe as both he and Joe duel it out vocally displaying their incredible vocal prowess throughout, meanwhile the following track and the album's biggest standout, that of course being the near 10 minute bludgeoning epic &#34;The Art of Dying&#34; starts things off with a cool and catchy tribal-like percussive intro which builds and builds up until finally blasting off into an explosive melee of vicious guitars, bass, and drums as they all relentlessly fight off against each other in such a savagely frenetic matter and that is until Mario's drums bring it all together with a slow, yet hefty, pounding and thunderous beat with Joe's powerful vocals also coming into play as well. This song is just filled with all sorts of incredibly heavy and mind-boggling riffs, breakdowns, and other changes of directions throughout especially with the most notable part of the song being the final breakdown which includes an incredibly epic, long, repeated yet hypnotic, energizing, mind-blowing riff that lasts about over four minutes long before fading away, something that reminds me of what Opeth did near the end of the title track of their 2002 masterpiece, &#34;Deliverance&#34;.<br /><br />Following that, we have track nine, &#34;Esoteric Surgery&#34; which is another fantastic song that is borderlined on by crunching, chugging rhythms, plus more beastly, slamming machine-gun-like double-timed drumming and menacing death metal tremolo picking guitars, while &#34;Vacuity&#34; is a steady yet crushing, mammoth stomper that is anchored by deft, steady, stomping, hefty drum beats and thundering cymbal crashes, and massively powerful, super heavy wall-crushing riffs and beastly, heart wrenching growls, as well as some powerful and memorable choruses, and is also highlighted by an awesome brain-cracking blast beat section around the 2:35 mark as well. Another awesome song, and one of my favorites. Moving on, we have track eleven, &#34;Wolf Down the Earth&#34; is yet another monstrous number that is highly dominated by more massively powerful, crushing, lumbering riffage, plus more humming-worthy death metal-ish tremolo picking and pinch harmonics, along with more blistering, ripping and skull-pummeling double bass slamming and some thunderous blasting beats, and is also highlighted by an awesomely amazing riff during the bridge that will just leave you breathless as well. Afterwards, closing things out, we have the album's title track &#34;The Way of All Flesh&#34; which is an absolute mind-blowing finale of a track which starts with a walloping drum intro and then segues into a punishing assault of super heavy, chugging, lumbering, pounding riffs and wicked, stomping drums and cymbal crashes, and monstrous vocals throughout that just destroy everything in it's path, and this song is also further highlighted by an unbelievably mind-blowing melodic finger tapping harmony riff near the end that is guaranteed to hypnotize your mind, and Joe also tends to throw in some clean vocals at the 4 minute mark as soon as the riff commences. The main piece of the track ends at 6:51 and there's a hidden songs which starts in at 12:33 giving the song a period of silence lasting 5:42. The song contains complex layers of ambient guitar sounds with various echo and reverb effects. This song ends promptly at 17:03 and closes the album.<br /><br />On a closing note, I have to honestly say that &#34;The Way of All Flesh&#34; is simply and easily one of the greatest and most creative and original albums that I've ever heard in my life and I'm talking about not just in metal, but in ALL of music period. I mean, everything about this album here is just amazing from every riff, to every drum beat, to every lyric and vocal delivery, this album here has truly got it all. I can clearly hear so many influences on here such as Meshuggah, Morbid Angel, Fear Factory, Strapping Young Lad, Cynic, Neurosis, Bolt Thrower, Decapitated, Pantera, Lamb of God, Mastodon, Voivod, and Opeth, and it's as if they all like got together and put all of their creative ideas into this amazing masterpiece of an album here. Bottom line, &#34;The Way of All Flesh&#34; is 100% pure original metal goodness and proves that metal music can be powerful and meaningful at the same time, and it also shows why Gojira are indeed something special and should never be overlooked. Anyways, I highly recommend this album to any fan of Gojira and metal music alike...HORNS UP!!! \m/ \m/<br /><br />Also be sure to check out Gojira's latest masterpiece from 2016, &#34;Magma&#34; as well too!!!<br /><br />Jeremy"

5.0,"Gift for my wife and she loves it. No complaints so far and she has worn it non stop for 2 weeks. Looks and feels like a quality product.<br />She is not a runner, she just really liked the looks if it so many of the features will go un used. However, it is loaded with features. She particularly likes the setting that automatically turns on the light when she tilts her wrist to look at the watch. It allows you to read it in the dark with only one had operation."
5.0,This was the best buy .  I'd buy them again if I could find the same deal.
5.0,They came earlier than expected. The chains are nice and sturdy. The charms are very lovely. The gold charm is a bit smaller than the silver one. All around happy with this purchase.

5.0,Christmas gift and she loved them.
5.0,Perfect addition for the rest of my F-91W's
5.0,"I recently purchased the SAM4s Cash Register Drawer Insert Money Till Tray 60 and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. This tray is a great addition to my cash register and has made organizing and handling money much easier.<br /><br />The 5 bill and 5 coin holder design is practical and efficient, allowing me to easily separate and organize my cash. The steel bill arms also provide added security and prevent bills from sliding out of place."
5.0,"Very cute, exactly as pictured.  This was a gift for my daughter who owns a Corgi, and she loved the key chain."
5.0,This mask is large on me.  I wear it on top of a 3 layer disposable mask.  The nose and chin fit well.  My glasses don’t fog up.  There is plenty of air space around nose and mouth.  I feel well protected and comfortable.  I will probably buy more.
5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from such an inexpensive belt, but it turned out to be surprisingly well made.  The buckle is very stout and not at all flimsy, and grips the track on the back really well. I have never had it slip yet. I am loosing weight end trying to find a traditional belt that looked good an wasn't too loose or too tight has been challenging.  With this belt I can snug it up to just the right amought to be comfortable and keep my pants up. Something I have found hard in the past because I have no waist and a bit of an overhsning stomach still. I will be buying a couple more so I can vary my wardrobe. At this price, I can easily afford to. Cutting to length was the only place I was not real ccomfortable, but it was easily done with a heavy pair of scissors. The nice thing is, as I continue to lose weight,  I can continue to adjust the fit and length to accommodate my changes. I am a little over 225 right now and have not had any problem with the buckle pulling free as complained about by a couple of others. Just make sure the belt is inserted all the way to the stop, and completely close the clasp."
5.0,"Please HURRY and bring this item back in a size L or XL.  I'm 5'6 and it dragged the floor without heels about 2inches but it works with heels.  The material is so soft and it was a QUALITY item.  The pockets were lovely and it is one of my favorite dresses.  Please, please, please bring this back."
5.0,I bought this because I was looking for a band that would work well with my active life. I workout at the gym pretty hard and I like to go hiking a lot. I needed something that wouldn’t rub against my wrist or get slick when I sweat. I’ve owned this for a few months now and I’ve never had a better band. It’s still stretchy and tight when I need it to be and always comfortable. Sometimes I have to adjust it back after I’ve taken it on and off a few times. I’m not gentle with it at all and it hasn’t broken. BEST $10 I’ve ever spent! SO WORTH IT!
5.0,Gave them to my 2 granddaughters for Christmas. Not only are they cute but fit really well. Both of my granddaughter are tall and slim. They appreciated the tall sizes.
5.0,"I love this sweatsuit! It is exactly as pictured and at a great price. Nice color, comfortable material and big pockets!"
5.0,My son loves this underwear! They feel good and fit perfect. I will be back for more.
5.0,so worth it and very easy to use!! The leather is soft and firm. The package box is just so gorgeous.
5.0,Perfect fit and replacement. The watch is new again.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:53dc2b596c9627940778bb1aaa22f17a]] I've had this Keychain for a while now and it has lasted longer than any others I've had, it's very pretty and it's exactly as described. (I added the button so it's not part of the actual product) When it came in I noticed the sewing was flawless, it lays flat and doesn't get in the way or snag. I would 100% order again and I guarantee if they're around when I ruin this one I will buy 2 more to replace it. I'm going to be ordering one for all my friends later too."

5.0,"Love !!!! I never can find a bra to fit right , iam impressed!!!"
5.0,grandson liked
5.0,"This top drapes and flows beautifully. It's very long in the back and just a little shorter in the front. It looks fabulous with leggings or skinny jeans, and yesterday I wore it tied up with an A line skirt and it was really cute. It does fit a little snug in the arms and accross the bust even though I bought a size bigger than I thought I'd need, so buy a size up...it's worth getting."
5.0,"This simple, handsome, stainless steel eyeglass chain, with its unique design, is a winner, partly because I can tell it will last forever, unlike most other metal chains.  I will not take away a star for my one complaint, which is that it hangs a little low on me (I am short) and I would love it more if it were several inches shorter, or could somehow be shortened.  It would be great if the manufacturer would offer it with a shorter chain."
5.0,"Hugs me in alythe rite places,  Good quality Awesome Purchase!!"
5.0,Loved the shade of blue. Can be used for girl or boy.
5.0,"Great product, no problems."

5.0,"I love it, and all my friends and family"
5.0,Original and beautiful product.
5.0,"My hubby is known at work and in the family for his varied collection of T-Shirts commemorating the best animated characters from his childhood and shows he's watched with our kids. Disney Gargoyles has always been a favorite at our house and finding this well-made, great looking T-Shirt with the entire Gargoyle gang in color like the original television intro was a wonderful find. When he wore it to work, everyone came up to compliment the good look of the shirt and ask could he get one for them too! I'm very particular about the T-Shirts I purchase for him, I don't want any flimsy material with logos that too quickly fade. This T-Shirt is well made, washes and dries well without losing shape or the colors fading. Good job on price and quality and a wonderful find! Thanks."
5.0,These are awesome so far 10 days! very comfortable and helpful .
5.0,"this is a very pretty scarf and for the money, am glad I purchased this."
5.0,"Bought this for my daughter who wears a size 4 in length but is between a 2t and 3t around the waist. Bought this leotard in a children's XS and it fits perfectly! Great quality material, and she loves it."
5.0,My first Yankees game 😁perfect fit
5.0,"I bought this bikini for my beautiful daughter in law.  It’s a great bikini.  It’s made very well out of great fabric.  The sizing is a little wonky, so make sure you check the sizing chart.  My daughter is a 00 so I ordered an X-small.  Worked out great.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion.  I do recommend this product, I just also recommend you double check the sizing chart and ask the seller questions about sizing before ordering."
5.0,"My family lives in Florida, so we are outdoors all year round. As a result, I wanted to ensure that my daughter had appropriate head coverage and sun protection. I absolutely love this hat, because it grows with your child! The hat has an adjustable pull tab that allows you to fit the hat to the circumference of your child's head, as well as a chin tie. I bought this for my daughter at 6 months and she still has plenty of room to grow into it at 17 months. Also, it looks so cute on and goes with all of her outfits (I purchased this hat in white). I will definitely be purchasing more in the future from this company!"
5.0,This is the best face mask every. Thank you
5.0,Looks and feels great. The carbon fiber is a nice touch.
5.0,Great for 5-6 year old girl
5.0,"I actually love it. It’s about the size of a Silverdollar, not too big. Really nice quality quite beautiful. The cord it comes on has an adjustable sleeve on it and shipping was incredibly quick. Best of all, the dragon in the Phoenix is the emblem to my Dojang."
5.0,"After reading the reviews, I wasn't too optimistic about this thing. However, it surpassed my expectations and ended up being a great addition to my wardrobe. The fit is indeed boxy, but that's what you want for an overshirt like this. It definitely fits into the niche between a jacket and a shirt, so you should note that before purchasing!<br /><br />The material is so much thicker than I'd expect, and it genuinely feels like a high-quality product. The patterns are cool and fashionable. Looks fantastic with a solid color tee shirt underneath."
5.0,"I wore this dress to my company Christmas party and received many compliments.  Ordered a Large in the Dark Green. I am 5'4"", 155 lbs and 36C."
5.0,Perfect to go over a dress for an outdoor wedding!
5.0,Fun bow tie. Made well
5.0,I got so tired of cramming my baby into tight jackets just to enjoy a ten minute walk so I got this as a quick and easy alternative and there are much fewer years from both mom and baby! It’s warm and comfy and easy to put on! Also it’s adorable!
5.0,"It was a good watch. It was there for me when I needed it. It was always on time, and never late. It was beautiful in every way. For $17 it was a cheap but durable watch. I had it for 2 long glorious months. Until one day in my car I got the rarest form of wedgy. I had my left hand free, the hand with the watch on it. I tried to fix the wedgy with the hand that was blessed with the presence of this watch. After I relieved myself from the pain of the harsh underwear wedgy by putting my left hand in my pants. I tried retrieving my hand from the tight  skinny denim jeans. As I did so the watches band snapped. The watch is still lost somewhere in my skinny jeans. Can't find. Send the help."
5.0,Very cute and stylish. Looks heavy but really isnt that bad. I pair it with a white tee and ripped jeans!
5.0,"So classy looking! Fits me perfect. I'm 5'4&#34; and about 120lbs. The outer material is a bit scratchy but they lined the dress with soft fabric, so that's nice."
5.0,"If they bunch up, hang them on something and it will take shape. Not that hard. No they don't adjust, read the description.<br />No need to adjust for me.<br /><br />They fit my tuna alleys great and the rubber piece that connects to the frame is just behind my ear, I don't feel it.<br /><br />It sticks out a little bit, because they are supposed to, so they don't snag on your shirt/ neck."
5.0,"Would be perfect except it runs very large. I bought the size 4 for my 4yo, and he's swimming in it. But it fits my 7yo (just barely) so he's using it for now. Otherwise it's very soft and cozy!"
5.0,So in love with this skirt' I'm 5'4 and 140lbs. I believe I ordered the skirt in a small. The back half of the waistline area of the skirt has an elastic which made it easier for me to pull the skirt up over my thick hips and thighs.<br /><br />The pockets on the skirt is great and fairly deep enough to put a cell phone in. The fabric is of great quality. I definitely will keep this skirt for years to come. I can't imagine it going out of style any time soon.<br /><br />Got plenty of compliments'

5.0,Just what I expected! I made a hangover kit for my newly 21 sister and connected a chapstick to the bag using this.  It just completed the aesthetic and was a cute touch.  I'd attach a picture but I obviously don't have it anymore so...sorry lol
5.0,Super comfy & soft
5.0,My daughter is 3 and these are perfect for her dance class cause she can take her feet right out after class. She doesn’t love to have her feet in socks or anything covering them.
5.0,This dress fit as I expected and gave me room to move. I thought it would be restricting but I fit to my standards.
5.0,"Exceptional Quality earrings, I will be purchasing more of this brand of earrings for my 18 month old GreatNiece!!"
5.0,Quality product. Great for resin crafts.
5.0,Cute. Nice fit. Looks great with tutu skirt under it
5.0,"It is very important that you order the right size. I had a pair of shoes that were sized in centimeters, so I ordered that size. They fit perfectly."
5.0,"I bought these for the whole family, hoping they would approximately fit all of us. They did the trick. I have the biggest adult head, and mine fit fine. They were a bit big on the kids (9 and 12), but not big enough to be uncomfortable or fall off. They are higher quality than the kind you find at the dollar store. The only complaint from one of my kids was they are a bit scratchy inside."
5.0,I love this bra! Great price & high quality. I’ve washed it a number of times and it still looks perfect.
5.0,Looks very pretty.

5.0,"This is what I've been looking for! It's just the right length, color and fit."
5.0,Very beautiful necklace!
5.0,So elegant and sylish!
5.0,"I got this for my dad as a gift. I love the color, just wish it wasn't so heavy, but still nice."
5.0,Select your true size. It’s not a gas station tee shirt.
5.0,Fit my glasses perfectly the color of the tint was just right not too dark not too light. The tinting is important to me especially in South Florida and these folks got it right.
5.0,"I really love the round style of this lanyard, It's weighted well, not stiff like some, and smooth on the skin, especially around your sensitive neck area.  I am getting ready to buy more!  Great Christmas stocking gifts!"
5.0,Rapidez
5.0,Love this product. 4th one I’ve purchased. This one for my gf. I’ve only needed to replace one due to old age and use.
5.0,The tin😉
5.0,I have gotten many compliments on. The necklace.
5.0,Love these pajamas. They’re really cute and extremely comfortable.
5.0,It fits exactly the way I had hoped it would. I felt so comfy and supported. I will be ordering a ton more.
5.0,Super cute & an excellent price. The &#34;blues&#34; in the picture is actually a dark green & the &#34;reds&#34; are actually orange in person. That's my only complaint
5.0,"The dress was super soft and supple. BUT unfortunately the bust area was way too tight, which tends to be a problem. wish i didn't have to return it"
5.0,"The color is beautiful and I love it, that’s why I bought it. Fabric is softener as well but it’s see through and if you gained some weight is going to show up. Honestly It’s comfortable and summertime dress & worthy."
5.0,Perfect and fast shipping
5.0,I received so many compliments on this dress :)
5.0,I love this bracelet. I own it in multiple colors.
5.0,A little large but that was what I wanted to keep the sun out my eyes.
5.0,I wanted something that covered me but was still sexy. This suit fit me as expected and I am really happy with it!
5.0,This Marine Corp pendant is exactly what the seller advertised it to be.  It’s a little larger than a USA quarter.  The glob and anchor is beautifully diamond cut that lies on black onyx.. My first day wearing this pendant I was stopped three times by people who complimented me and asked where I bought this piece. Potential buyers of this jewelry piece won’t be let down. Well worth the price.
5.0,Item arrived quickly and exceeded expectations. My four-year-old loves it and it looks comfortable. I have already ran it through the washer/dryer twice and it appears to hold up well.
5.0,"I own so many of these shirts. I love them. I will wear them around the house with shorts and sweats. If I wear them out of house to work or running errands, I like to tie up one corner. They are a little longer than a normal t-shirt. Hold up great in washer and dryer, no balling and graphic stays."
5.0,"Great color, great weight...not stiff or heavy-very flowy! Only issue is the pockets seem a tad too far back on the bodice.  Perhaps more fabric on the back and a little less in the front.  Also, I had to replace the plastic rings that hold the straps- one snapped and broke the first day. Try using metal?!  Otherwise, great dress!"
5.0,No need for long underwear with these soooo comfortable lined and weather proof pants. Love them!
5.0,It is a nice find. I like the material. Nice and soft kinda feels like lamb skin. The yellow is a nice mustard color . Looks adorable. Fits nicely too. The only thing is that in the photo it shows snaps for the lapels but when you get it in person there is no snaps for the lapels so they can stay flat. But that's not a big deal
5.0,These sunglasses are so cute! Even comes with a micro fiber cloth to keep the sunglasses in. Good quality.
5.0,"Attractive and good quality. True to size, however, a bit Form fit for a more perfect figure as every body flaw will show."
5.0,"I really love this dress. Its better than I expected for the price, super comfortable and light. It will keep me cool and comfortable through the brutal Southeast NC summer. I am 5'6 140 lbs and the medium is perfect. I wish there were more colors available."
5.0,"It’s exactly what is advertised. Fits snug,but it’s good so it’s not lose around my wrist. Material is good and does not feel cheap. I would recommend."
5.0,"Beautiful, very well made."
5.0,"Soft, fits well. Perfect for laying around the house."
5.0,The cutest and great quality!!
5.0,"I've owned Nike, New Balance, Addidas, etc. and these are the most comfortable and supportive athletic shoes I've ever owned."
5.0,They fit perfect love them❗️
5.0,The material is nice and fits good. You can tell is a great quality. Very confortable.
5.0,Great packaging! Great quality. My husband wore it for our elopement in Vegas. Easy to tie!
5.0,"I love this dress.  I change into it when I get home.  It's relaxing and comfortable.  It's exactly what it looks like.  A little bit sexy in top but very comfortable on the bottom.  It hits the ground for me but I'm 5'7"".  So it might be longer or shorter depending on your height.  I totally feel sexy in it."
5.0,It’s beautiful well made
5.0,"It is definitely heavier, thicker, and bulkier than I thought it was going to be. Then again I didn’t really know what to expect, I thought I was going to get something over priced and that was made with cheap materials. That was not the case, this seems to be made of durable high quality materials. I haven’t had an issue with it randomly coming open at all and it actually holds a beer also.  Hopefully this review helps someone deciding if they want this or not."
5.0,Blocks harmful rays and glare.
5.0,Fits my 5 year old great!
5.0,They are durable and quite nice compared to other sunglasses i have purchased online in the past. Thanks for the great fashion!
5.0,Beautiful rich color and the material is both soft and cool. I would buy again just in a larger size.
5.0,"Item exactly as described, nice and professional looking, no frills."
5.0,My photographer girlfriend just loves these and she gets asked about them all the time. They really look like they are good quality.
5.0,"Handsome, keeps liquids warm, and easy to handle. Size is just right. Used it for the first time for a church group meeting and it did the job for us! Nice touch to have the creamer and cleaner tool, too."
5.0,I bought this as a gift for a Mighty Ducks fan. The person loved it! This is her 4th Mighty Ducks jersey. They are thick enough to wear in the winter but light enough for the spring.
5.0,They are slightly larger than expected but very comfortable.
5.0,"I am 5'4&#34; 200lbs. I wear a 38C. I bought a medium. I liked the olive so I took a chance. Its snug but i do not have a large bust so its comfortable. I have cleavage in it and surprisingly, my husband loves it. Crop top and all! I'll get a large next time."
5.0,its beautiful its just a shame one of the pearl lines were slightly crooked.
5.0,Me encanto!!
5.0,Product was good quality made and fits true to size.  Good summer shirt.
5.0,I ordered the xl and it fit perfect. For reference I'm 6' tall and about 215 pounds. It came right to my knees which is just the right length. The fabric is really soft and the pattern is beautiful. I'm really happy with this dress and will definitely buy another!<br /><br />I was originally sent the wrong dress (different brand and style) but I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement within 2 days without me having to process the return of the wrong item first. If I had needed the dress when I first ordered it I would have been disappointed and it probably would have changed my star rating but since I was not under a time crunch and could wait for it overall I was really pleased with how it was handled.
5.0,Love this bag so much!!!! Great for sports snacks and travel!
5.0,"My daughter does not like wearing dresses, but LOVES this one... it is very simple and fits well."
5.0,Fantastic travel hat
5.0,"This chain is lovely. The size is perfect for pendants or charms. Singapore chain in my experience are fairly strong, I din't think I have ever had one bream. I used to buy gold but that is so far out of my price range these days. I like sterling silver it just requires a little more cleaning. Hair products tend to tarnish silver quickly and wearing to the beach with salt water is not advisable. Salt water tarnishes silver quickly. I worked in jewelry years ago so I certainly have my favorites and Singapore is one. Arrived in a beautiful box hate to give the box away."
5.0,These were great for my roses.  I'm doing a whole bunch of cleaning and pruning back this year and it's the worst when you have to stick your arm in up to the elbow to clear out leaves when you're just wearing regular garden gloves.  These worked awesome and the stickers didn't catch in them all over like they do with shirts and jackets.  My rose with the crazy long thorns didn't stand a chance either.  I was able to take a stem in my fist and not even feel them.<br /><br />They're not for any kind of fine work.  I used them with a pair of two handed clippers and I'd probably have a really hard time trying to use the one handed ones.  They also slip a little since they are one size fits all and a little big for me so I'm thinking I'll look into using a pair of elastic bands to hold them in place.  Next I plan to tackle my blackberries...<br /><br />Additional Edit:  On sizing: though these are way too loose for me they are perfectly fine for my husband's man hands.  They work like a champ on blackberries too.  I can just grab a vine and yank with no issues.
5.0,"Very nice ensemble.Light weight,Great wear"
5.0,The fit was just as my husband wanted. True to size when it's washed it should fit even better.
5.0,"Used this to embellish my friend's daughter outfit for her birthday. She had an emoji themed birthday party and wanted a custom outfit for birthday girl, I hooked it up and she loved the tutu, she just turned 12 she tall and petite and it fit her lovely."
5.0,Delivered quickly and good quality. Glasses come in a plastic case with a cloth to clean them. The size is perfect but may be too big for those with smaller faces. The cat eye is subtle but still there. Would recommend
5.0,It was a great shirt! Great material!
5.0,"I have two of these shirts now and I'm going to buy more. They are thinking but not see through things. Very loose fitting but not body, they flow with your body. So very soft and comfortable to wear. They have good quality in how they're made."
5.0,"This boys jacket is just what I was looking for in a warm, water and wind proof and slim profile. The material is exceptional and just the right color too. My little great grandchild is so pleased with it, he dislikes the cumbersome, ""puffy"" feel and look (he says). He's an active little boy. It's the perfect choice for him."
5.0,"These are perfect! The only difference between three and original lenses is that they don't say polarized on them but you can tell they are and it's just like looking  through the original lenses. Enjoyed the super easy to find video on YouTube, love the company's personal touches, fast shipping, good price. I highly recommend! They saved my favorite glasses and I didn't have to shell out hundreds for a new pair!"
5.0,Nice weight 👌🏿to them not  flimsy at all.💯
5.0,Exactly like the photo. Very pretty a bit see through
5.0,My daughter loves them. Very cozy and good quality!
5.0,What I love about my nightgown is I can walk around indoors  and outdoors feeling cute and comfortable.
5.0,Excellent product 100% recommended
5.0,"Reminds me of why I love my wife, 25 years after I married her."
5.0,The bags seem to be very sturdy strong
5.0,Love the fit and color! Went with a small. I’m 5’5” and around 126 pounds. Perfect for the price.
5.0,"When ordering this dress, I wasn't sure what size to order, im in the middle of losing weight and I was torn between wanting to order a dress that fits me NOW but may fit too big in the future, or a dress that is smaller now, but may fit LATER. I took a chance and ordered the large hoping for the best. After I placed my order, I panicked because it looked to me like the other girls that ordered a large and wrote reviews looked a lot smaller than me and i thought &#34;great, most likely it wont fit.&#34; But to my surprise when it arrived, It fit!! i was happy to see that the fabric has some stretch to it which makes it fit comfortably but i have a feeling it will still fit as i lose weight; Im currently 40 inches at the largest part of my bust a 33 1/2 inch waist. The only minor issue with fit is the buttons pull a little bit over my chest but i was suprised to see this dress comes with a side zipper; i can pull the dress over my head without having to undo the buttons so im going to be using my sewing machine to sew the front shut. I ordered the color yellow because i wanted a color i could wear almost year round and this almost mustard yellow is perfect. Be aware that this color is a bit see through (i could see my black bra when i first tried it on) so nude undies are a must and i imagine the same applies for the other lighter color choices. My only wish for this dress is that it were longer, im 5'6 and this dress hits right at my knee which is fine, i just wanted more of that 1950s below the knee look but its still a cute modest dress I'll enjoy wearing. It also didnt come with care instructions so i just washed it in cold water and hung to dry like all my other delicates ( i didnt iron the dress when i took these pics, thats what it looks like after hanging dry).  Overall i think the quality matches the price, its not an overly extravagant and expensive dress but its definitely a nice dress.<br /><br />P.S. im not one of those people doing reviews in exchange for discounts, i paid full price for this dress."
5.0,"Beautiful, small, and good quality. Exactly what I wanted and exactly has described."
5.0,These are cute and stylish. They look better in person.
5.0,"Already received compliments about this watch, stylish and all around watch. It was a good buy for me!!! Priced reasonably and shipped swiftly...VERY IMPRESSED!!!"
5.0,Very GOOD
5.0,Daddy like !
5.0,My best band purchase yet!!!! Finally one I don’t have to return! I will be buying all of the other colors!
5.0,So gentle!
5.0,Quality is much better than I expected for the price. Would recommend.
5.0,Really comfortable and cute!
5.0,Except for the smell (be prepared to wash before use) it is a good product! Fits perfect!
5.0,Really nice ring. Could not believe for the price  this ring is such a nice well made ring! Fast shipping! Very satisfied!
5.0,"Very classy and cute dress, I plan on wearing it to a wedding next month! Originally ordered a large because that's what I usually wear but it was a little too big around the stomach area (I'm 5'6 and weigh 160 lbs with a pear shape body). I ended up returning it for a medium and it's a little tight but it stretches! Great buy for the price!"
5.0,Supper soft.... furry...and warm.... wife uses them and daughter uses them as knee highs
5.0,Update I got the yellow one for my anniversary 😍<br />It's beautiful and fits great<br />I am all around impressed the dress is beautiful super cute for a woman of any age a nice flirty date night dress or with a little pair of sneakers to head out to the park. I will be purchasing from this seller again. Size medium
5.0,"This was a great find, I will probably order a couple other colors. Can be casual or dressed up. The only issue I had is that the legs are a little on the longer side (I am 5'6) I absolutely love it."
5.0,"I haven't worn a watch consistently in about 10 years, mostly because I've transitioned keeping time from a wristwatch to my cell phone/smartphone.  I also have worked in front of a computer for the past 13 years and don't really like the weight of a watch on my wrist all day, or one getting in the way of me resting my arm on my desk between typing.<br /><br />Over the past couple years, smart watches have been catching my eye, but I haven't quite gotten comfortable with the idea of dropping $2-300 (or more) on a watch, when I am not certain I even like wearing watches anymore.  To add to the struggle, my fashion has been changing as I've been growing older and I'm finding a wristwatch probably compliments my fashion choices well.  What to do?!<br /><br />Enter the Apache Pine Sqwatch.<br /><br />This watch caught my eye as a reasonably priced fashion statement watch, while not breaking the bank. Perfect for me as I transition to strapping something on my wrist for the first time in a decade.<br /><br />When I received it I was immediately blown away by the unique stylish yet rugged look of the wood married with the leather band.  The beautiful wood watch body and face have an elegant look that can be worn with dress clothes, but the watch as a whole is rugged enough to be worn with trendier (hipster maybe?) styles.  When I pulled the watch out of the box, I was very impressed with how light this thing is - perfect for someone that hates a heavy metal watch on my wrist for more than a few minutes!  I've looked over my watch for imperfections, and the biggest flaw I could find after wearing it a good number of times over the past few weeks was one of the white stitches in the band is not fully threaded and the end was loose.  It's TBD if this will have any long term problems (I don't think it will), but it was literally the only thing I could find wrong with this beautiful timepiece. The wood is absolutely gorgeous when it catches light!  I bought the 45mm band model and it fits my normal man's wrist nicely - not too big and not too small.<br /><br />Now, full disclosure, I did received this watch at a discount to provide my honest and unbiased review of it, and at the time I purchased it, it was sitting pretty at $98 (it still is $98 in the AP web store).  Personally, I think $100 is a little steep for this watch, but again, this is coming from someone that doesn't purchase watches often (ever), so that might be the going price for a quality watch like this.  Since I bought it, at the time of writing this review, the price has dropped in half to $49 currently.  I would not hesitate to purchase a second watch (maybe the Original) at this price, personally. I think it's right about where I would value it.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic watch, that's sure to be a conversation piece if watch lovers notice you wearing it.  I encourage you to read up on Apache Pine so you can tell the story of these cool timepieces if you buy one.<br /><br />One last comment - I attempted to research where the watches were manufactured, but I have been unable to find that info anywhere. The box says they're designed in Idaho, USA, but I'm guessing they're built overseas to keep the production costs down. I would be nice if they were a little more straightforward with that info, but I'm not holding it against them."
5.0,I love this dress I am a 1x but I bought a 2x and it fits perfect it's light weight but warm
5.0,"I am 115 pnds, I wear Small to XS clothes, and I do laps in the pool, I needed a tightly fitting swimsuit, so ordered Medium, it's perfect, didn't even have to take it in anywhere (as I usually do). Recommend for sure, but size up or even two. Fits great, the neon inserts look great, give lost of interest, open back dose not squish skin out, so everything looks in place. Material at the back is shaped in such way as to give an excellent thinner looking waist!!! Hip bands fit nicely, hip cutouts make your legs look longer, and sexier!"
5.0,"These are very comfortable,  they have a great fit ! I use them to exercise and sometimes even as a regular bra. These are great."
5.0,Great dress!  Comfy and soft!  It has washed wonderfully.  The sleeves are long enough even after several washes.  I would buy again
5.0,Exactly the cleaner I was hoping for.
5.0,Cute comfy ran big but was cute still
5.0,Fits great in all the right places. Cute flappy sleeves.  Soft and super comfy. Cute jewel detail gives a little something extra
5.0,Looks and fits great.. I love it..
5.0,Material is ok but I wish it was a little bit thicker to avoid turf burn.
5.0,"really like it, very beautiful item, affordable price"
5.0,Perfect for swim class at school and summer camp.
5.0,I love this dress! I have a really hard time finding a maxi dress that fits and looks good and this dress is perfect! I am a size 12/38D and purchased an xl.
5.0,I am very pleased with this mask. It is also 4 ply which is great!
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress!  I’m 4’11” and purchased a small. The dress fits perfectly. My only word of caution, is the neck line. If you hold small children a lot, you’ll need to be mindful that your undergarments could inadvertently be exposed from being easily pulled down!  However, if you are a nursing mom, this may actually be an advantage."
5.0,"These PJs are so comfy, and they are made really well. Also, the shorts have pockets, WIN! The material is very soft, and stretchy. I got the cherry patterned ones, they’re sooo cute. I was nervous they would run small, so I sized up, but that was unnecessary as these are pretty big, but it makes them extra comfy so I’m not mad. I suggest staying true to your size though."
5.0,"#1 thing I look for in aftermarket bands are the connections where the two ends link to the watch, and they fit as good, if not better than OEM.  The magnetic band clasps very well at two points of contact, and its very comfortable.  One thing to think of before buying is your hand size... if you're a man, with a hand siz greater than med/lrg, then this item might be a little tough to get onto your wrist, as I had barely enough wiggle room to get this on - I wear a med/lrg glove for reference."
5.0,It fit perfect and fit right in all the right places. Love that even though is tight is it not see through because the material is thick enough to cover. The material is high end will definitely reorder in other colors.
5.0,Wonderfull colors. Very sturdy
5.0,"Great jewelry cleaning cloth. Usually I find these for Silver only - but this helps in maintaining shine to jewelry of all metals, fake or real and polishes stones -in between actual cleaning. Works well, works fast and easy. This is the second time  I purchased this brand. It  comes in a nice resealable plastic zip closure bag for storing... I suppose you could just put it in a baggie but this bag is sized to fit the cloth."
5.0,Firs great!
5.0,Great product. My daughter loved it
5.0,Is very beautiful
5.0,I love this shirt. The fabric is very similar to active wear. It fits very well I am a 34 B and I purchased a Xl. It fits my arms nicely. I'm sure if my chest were bigger it still would fit.<br />I was nervous to buy it because I know Asian sizes run small. But to my surprise I am satisfied with the size and quality.
5.0,I bounce between being a medium and large. I am 5'4&#34; 155lbs and ordered the medium. It fits perfect. It is a little see through but I love wearing it to work when I'm wearing a tank top so it is appropriate and keeps me a little less chilly in the air conditioning. The color was spot on and it doesn't look cheaply made! Will definitely be buying more of these in a different color.
5.0,I got this because I like leopard and wanted a hat with the paws and the price was good. The hat I rec'd was different then the one shown in the picture but I like it way better!! It has longer fur and better coloring and the ears dont have that brown color they are just all fur and the same color as the rest of the hat. The quality is very good for the price and it did shed a little but not bad at all. I love the zipper pocket and I can fully extend my arms while my hands are in the mittens/paws. LOVE it!!!
5.0,"I bought these pajamas for my wife's birthday.  She absolutely loves them.  Perfect fit, comfortable and well made."
5.0,"It's a good size and you can just pick it up and shake the sand out of it, when it's time to go!"
5.0,I am 170 lb and 5.5 hight. The kimono is good for the price.
5.0,LOVE this hat so much! Super cute and cannot wait for St Patrick’s Day! I would definitely recommend. Great price too. ☘️
5.0,Great product. Fits perfect and made well.
5.0,The fabric is soft and flowing. The fit is great. It is a great dress for an amazing price.
5.0,a1
5.0,Just precious.
5.0,Pretty much what  I  expected...good basic yellow  lens glasses all plastic  construction...also  include an unexpected free clip
5.0,Will buy another belt in the future
5.0,The top had very nice support and enhancement. The material was good quality.
5.0,Marine Mom very excited.
5.0,"My son really liked them, he said they are comfortable and stylish"
5.0,I love this ring!! It’s beautiful and is just the right amount.
5.0,I first purchased 2 pairs of these for a long air flight in early 2020. I recently purchased 4 additional pairs to aid me in getting over sciatic leg issues resulting from spinal surgery. They help a lot.
5.0,I love these sunglasses. I feel like Wonder Woman when I wear them!
5.0,"A well-made product. It needs to be made with slightly thicker material, and also needs to be made slightly larger for a adult woman’s head. They need to have better quality control, as some bonnets are made slightly tighter,  with the elastic than others. In other words, sometimes they use more or less elastic, while constructing the bonnet. They should also make sure that all the bonnets have a variety of colors, and are all 100% cotton, as these bonnets are.  Overall, it is a good product. Thank you for making these beautiful bonnets, and I hope this helps everyone. 🤗"
5.0,I love the face bracket because it holds my mask in place and creates breathing space for me. It’s very lightweight and the softness of the bracket feels good on my face. I am able to wear my mask comfortably without feeling like I’m closed in and sucking up the mask whenever I breathe. I brought one for my sister and she loves it. It holds both of her mask in place. I will buy again!
5.0,Bought for myself and my daughter held it hostage since she loves it so much. Gorgeous will add glamour to any outfit.
5.0,"Wore this with a strappy camisole and it stayed in place all evening. Easy to clean and fit as expected. I didn't see any lines through my top so that's a plus. I will say that that night was especially hot so because these are silicone and are not breathable I had some boob sweat that I otherwise would not have had. I have a small chest so boob sweat is never an issue for me so that was the only thing that caught me by surprise. However, that is not an issue of the product. Only worn once so I can't say how well it holds up with multiple washes."
5.0,Love love love this!!! Will be ordering a few more colors. Nice quality material and great length for my 5'7&#34; height. Definitely recommend this dress
5.0,"Super cute and well done! It was a little more expensive then my other scarfs, but it is by far better. Pretty thick, warm fabric. The print was beautiful and the colors are as seen. Sewing was quality work as well."
5.0,Love this dress so comfy
5.0,Awesome for the kids
5.0,Excellent quality….definitely would recommend and would buy again!
5.0,I like the warmth of these pants. I could have gone with a small if I wanted them to be more fitted but the medium works to be able to wear leggings under. They are a looser fit. I  have worn them for morning walks in 20 degree weather and was warm.
5.0,"It's cute. It's a lot of material! Boarderliine too much, but it's a good quality at least."
5.0,Wonderful socks! I highly recommend them. You will NOT be disappointed!
5.0,It is very stylish and good looking.
5.0,"Perfect fit, great fabric and style!"
5.0,"I love this dress! it's so comfortable, and fits perfectly. I want all the colors!"
5.0,It was used at an nfl game worked great
5.0,"I purchased this item thinking that I might use it on occasion.<br />I have not gone back to the original SS band since, several months.<br />Excellent Price-Value, and very comfortable."
5.0,"Wow, impressive quality on first opening. My wife has a ravean jacket that she has loved, so I thought I'd give this rugged one a try.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Heavyweight. It has a good heft to it, including the hood. I'm often in the mountains and this has become my new favorite jackets.<br />-you can heat the jacket or hands separately (my hands get cold more often than anything else, so I like just having the hands on).<br />-smart design,it has designed holes so you can pass a charging cable to any pocket.<br />-durable: everything is clean and tight, well made.<br />-the zipper is smooth as butta'.<br />-roomy: it's a good work jacket with no restrictive movement<br />-battery seems pretty solid. I've been getting about 2 1/2 hours with it on high with just the body heat. I don't often leave the hand heat on for long, when I do, closer to 2 hours.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-not a fitted look, a hair on the large size ( I got a medium, I'm 5'8 165 lbs and I got plenty of room on length and room, it's good for putting on layers though)<br />-my wife steals my battery to stay warm with her coat that she uses almost everywhere (she was always cold in restaurants: boom heated jacket, not anymore)<br /><br />Overall great purchase, very nice quality. I'd recommend it to anyone."
5.0,"good quality, looks exqactly like on photos"
5.0,Fits to size has a very pretty flow
5.0,Is exactly what I was looking for.

5.0,Shirt is of really good quality

5.0,"Beautiful, I love it<br />It's nice material and design"
5.0,"Comfortable socks just in time for a Halloween party. The design is built into the stitching (IE different color threads, not just printed on top of a white sock) so it doesn't get distorted when you wear."
5.0,Wish it came in a size 11
5.0,Fits great ! I’m usually a large very nice material worth the money

5.0,This swimsuit is a fun way to stay modest when swimming in the pool or at the beach.
5.0,"Stylish, quality and comfy!! I love these socks!"

5.0,Gracias! Excelente!
5.0,Great for ponytail wearing
5.0,Great. just like the picture. much more expensive in department store. I love it.
5.0,Arrived quick and as described. Was a Christmas gift<br />that was well received.
5.0,Love it!! Fast Shipping very surprised how fast it got here. Picture makes it look bigger than what it is but its still very pretty its not too big or too small its just right :)
5.0,These earrings are great & I really like them! They look bigger around in the picture than they are.
5.0,It is all that I was hoping it to be.  It is the perfect size.  Hold all of my stuff. Fits a Samsung Galaxy S4 with a case just fine. Can be carried as a clutch and used as a wallet. I purchased a black one.  Seriously thinking about purchasing another one in a different color.  This is a must have! It comes with an adorable Gift Box and a wonderful smelling Sachet Packet FOR Your Lingerie.
5.0,This was shipped to someone as a gift. He has since received lots of compliments.
5.0,i ordered a medium when i should have gotten a small. im 5'6&#34; and 145 pounds. i wear a very thick undershirt to make it fit right
5.0,I finally had a chance to wear my Adhesive Silicone Bra and it was comfy! Placement and removal was easy. They adhered well and didn't move. I wore them under a deep v neck dress for 6 hours and there were no worries. I highly recommend this product.
5.0,"Received in perfect and flawless condition. This necklace looks absolutely elegant and gorgeous. Energic series consist of three sizes, small, medium and large. I picked the later one. Large is not just different in term of pendant size, it also comes with both gold and silver necklaces blended together. Two-tone matching is no doubt much more eye-catching than the single necklace design in medium and small models. In addition, it looks more thicker and just right for larger pendant.<br /><br />Besides, the color of the big crystal changes overtime from light golden yellow to deep amber according to different light sources shine on it, fascinating indeed. My wife loves it so much! Highly recommended."
5.0,"Frat quality, look, and feel…"
5.0,i love them! fit perfect and the material is pretty good
5.0,"I am very tall (5'10&#34;) and ordered a small; it is short but not too short. Also, I wear a pair of running shorts underneath just in case. I am thin and it does not look too big on me either since it is intended to be loose and flowy."
5.0,This has pretty much been my go-to dress all summer.  Easy to wear.  No fading.  Highly recommend however it doesn't really stretch and the fabric is on the thicker side.  It's still comfortable in warm weather however.
5.0,These earrings are stunning in their asymmetry and length. The cabuchon-style stones are lovely shades of blue. I receive many compliments when I wear these.  They are especially lovely with your hair swept back behind your ears.  They give you that artistic vibe.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my grandson. Quality was great.  It fit as it was supposed to. Will definitely buy this again (but in a different color lol)
5.0,It fits great and very comfortable
5.0,Love love this dress.
5.0,"A little less than week before we're supposed to have family pictures done my S-I-L decided to tell us that there was a color theme. I was able to pick up a blue polo at the store for my husband, but there was nothing in the women's section. I hate shopping for clothes online because no 2 stores sizes are the same. I ordered the 2XL to be safe, sometimes I wear just an XL or size 18-20, but I hate tops that cling or show every bump & roll from either my stomach or my pants. & since being postpartum I didn't want anything emphasizing any extra fluff for pictures that are going to hang around for all eternity.<br />It fits as a good 2XL. It would still look nice & flow well off someone who is a bit bigger than me even. I don't look like I'm drowning in fabric either. Looks normal facing from the front, & only looks like it hangs widely from the side. As I loose the baby weight it'll look okay with a belt I'm willing to bet as well. It's a nice fabric, kind silly silky-ish. Reminds me of a few of my maxi dresses. It's very comfortable. & very importantly in my case, the shipping was fast with prime, it was blue, wasn't overly priced. & I'll actually wear it again."
5.0,"I haven't found a sheer bra since I was a 38D. I'm now a 48H, they didn't have this size, so I tried the 46I. It's beautiful and sexy. Fits comfortable. I only wish they had other colors, I would buy everyone. I'll probably just buy another. I'm so happy to see the range of sizes."
5.0,I really love these pearls.  I didn't have double stranded ones so I decided to get these.  I posted them in a pic and I got a lot of compliments on them.  They also look great on!  Lol.
5.0,I got rave reviews from friends and strangers who saw me sporting my Meow watch with plastic leopard print strap. It's a must-have for all feline fanatics!!
5.0,It was perfect!!!
5.0,Fits well and is fun to wear
5.0,"Adjusts perfectly, so I don't have to worry about it being too small or too large. Love being able to just push on the logo and not have to bother with the hassle of unbuckling. Will definitely be buying more of this type in the future."
5.0,Love this under my jacket for work
5.0,Perfect weight to the silk. Outstanding embroidery. Won't find a better dea.l
5.0,"So much fun!!!!!! Very cozy, and keeps my head warm!!!!!"
5.0,"Fabric is sturdy, waistband seems bulky but is still very comfortable"
5.0,"Good quality material, LOVE all the colors, still to big for my little one. Strap for under the foot just kinda dangles due to the elastic being cut too big for her little feet."
5.0,"Fit perfect, love them"
5.0,"The combination of the blues is awesome. You can wear with any blue jeans. Very comfortable. Wear an 8, ordered an 8, and they fit great."
5.0,Love and it fits great.  I am 5 4 so its long.  I will wear with heals.
5.0,Love the material- very light for a warm day. I’m 5’0 34-29-40 and it fits good. A little long for me but that’s expected since I’m short. Will order more!
5.0,We use it for swimming and for ballet great fit my daughter absolutely loves it 💗
5.0,Perfect size when you don't want a large bag but you require something bigger than a wristlet.<br />I have two of these in different colors and I love them. I will probably order more.<br />It comes with a wrist strap which I don't use but its nice to know you have it if you want it. I use the over the should strap.
5.0,Super cute! Love em
5.0,"This coat is exactly as shown. Very good quality. Beautiful. I wear XL, so I ordered XL. Too tight. It's also extremely warm... great for the northern folk, too much for Florida, lol. I'm having to return it, but it would've been perfect if the fleece lining were removable."
5.0,"a gift for my niece, she loved it"
5.0,I love My new ring! Very delicate! I have received a lot of complements :)
5.0,"Great quality and presentation! May be a little tighter then I expected, or I may be a bit bigger, it was the just holidays after all ;)"
5.0,Loved the quality and feel. It wasn't hard to get them in and out. Thank you for an amazing product
5.0,"First, the colors are bright and rich. I am 5'5"" 190 lbs. I got a Large. Im not that busty, heavier in midsection, and larger hinderparts lol. Outfit was very flattering. I was not tugging. I didnt even have to iron it. It has a slight stretch to it. Loved the pockets. Not flimsy at all. Very comfy. And if you like a baggy or blousy look, order a size up. Either way, excellent buy."
5.0,Great product better than the competitors
5.0,"I orderd xl and normally wear a large in shirts, xl if i want it baggy. This fits nicely. Has saved me a few times when sun was beaming. I think it's worth the purchase to protect my skin. The berry color is beautiful."
5.0,I have sensitive ears and can only wear 18k gold ear rings and these were super cheap and don't irritate my ears at all. If you have multiple piercings in a row these are the perfect size because they are smaller!
5.0,Seems like the OEM part
5.0,The eyeglass case arrived in great packaging and looked amazing and the cloth was packaged inside the eyeglass case. I would recommend the product to others for sure!
5.0,"Great value! Like the description says, the belt fits pretty snug (I ordered the L-XXL size, I'm a size 16). It's beautiful though! This belt will go perfectly with several plain dresses to make them really pop."
5.0,"I'm loving this scarf! It's so easy to manipulate how you'd like to style it and so soft. Also, I can unfold it and toss over my lap or shoulders if I'm cold. If you're looking to accessorize your outfit, look no further than a soft blanket scarf!"
5.0,Worked perfect for an outdoor garden wedding. My heels are in tact and free of mud/grass and I didn't sink! Highly recommend!
5.0,Such cute earrings. They look amazing
5.0,Got sad bunch of these. Their great.
5.0,Just as expected. Good size to fit on suv.
5.0,little sayings you see an cheer you up.  This cute key-chain is a nice gift for a teenage or young adult.
5.0,Comfortable perfect fit.
5.0,"Great buy, these glasses are just what I needed after cataract surgery.  They are perfect for reading and carrying in my handbag.  They are very light weight and comfortable to wear.  I highly recommend them."
5.0,Love this basic all purpose comfy dress. I wish it came in more colors a grey version would be awesome.
5.0,Love them. Don’t know why some say it’s hard to put on????? It was very easy. Thank-U for a great product. Those at the store are for ——. I hated them. Looks great on my ring’s. Can’t even feel them.💖😍👍👌👏.Keep up the great work. Want to get the kit soon.( ring sizer). Have a great week day.
5.0,Easy on and off. Comfortable. True to size.
5.0,"For me Marnis have brilliant style. This sandal (and another I got) have a great fit too, dressed up or down. They're comfortable and rather sturdy too, I look to be rocking them for years! So I'm cool with the price - especially as I've landed them with a steep discount. By way, they fit true to size."
5.0,My 8 year old loved this skirt! cute for Halloween
5.0,Love this! So cute! My favorite nose ring by far!
5.0,"I love the dress, however it was a little big despite measuring per their chart.  The dress is beautiful, I received a lot of compliments on it."
5.0,Dress is made of mesh on the sleeves and side areas.
5.0,"I've purchased a lot of tops by PattyBoutik, and this one doesn't disappoint.  It's very cute and flirty, and the material is nice and stretchy.  And with a little tab of double-sided clothing tape in front to keep the strap aligned with my bra strap, there will be no need for a strapless bra (which grows more uncomfortable as the night wears on).  Now if COVID would disappear so I could actually leave the house again...."
5.0,Attached very easily. It is comfortable and looks nice
5.0,Great jacket. Especially considering the price. It fits great and the material has a bit of stretch to it. Which allows for a nice almost tailored fit. It is lined which adds a little more warmth. Not to much though.
5.0,"Wow! This is my first time ever cleaning silver jewelry and it worked perfectly. My Tiffany jewelry were beginning to look somewhat tarnished so I researched all the products that might work. This piece of cloth worked wonders. The cloth is simple to use and affordable. You could see the shine come back in the jewelry within a few rubs. And yes, your fingers will get a little dirty."
5.0,"You can always rely on J&B quality! Such an easy set of shirts to love - basic colors for every outfit, and fabulous reversible v-neck/scoop design is genius!"
5.0,Seem to be a quality product.  Time will tell.
5.0,"May have ordered too small, very hard to put on.but it fit my son so it’s alright, thank you, going to order a bigger size for me, my shoe size is 9 and a half."
5.0,Granddaughter really liked it.
5.0,Wonderful fit and cute
5.0,"Bought my first Pandora silver bracelets and charms at a Jewelry store. I have 6 granddaughters and wanted to start a quality bracelet for them. I looked on Amazon to see what was offered there  On Pro Jewelry, Elizabeth Charms, and others thru Amazon you get lovely sterling for a fraction of the price of theJewelry store.  Some  sites like Pro Jewelry have free shipping. I am sold on them (pun intended)."
5.0,"Awesome dress! Definitely exceeded my expectations. If you are like me, and weary about ordering dresses online...don't hesitate! This dress is just as described if not better. Super soft, flowy and great length. It hits under my knees, about mid calf.. and the best part? IT HAS POCKETS!! and cut out shoulders, which is super cute. I would say you could size down a size depending how you like it to fit. I got my expected size and it was flowy, just how I like it. Will add picture later."
5.0,The product fits perfdctly. Not too snug and a little  stretch. The material is nice and soft as well. The logo has survived 3 washes so far as well. Also there has been no shrinking. Overall I absolutely love this shirt and am so glad I got it!
5.0,Perfect for chest day at the gym and it brings back those great childhood memories for folks when they see it.  Gotta find a Battlecat tank top now.
5.0,"I bought these and they arrived WAY before they were supposed to. I took them to my local piercing shop and got pierced with them after they were sanitized. I love them, the ball is easy to get in and out and they have a nice weight and a nice little jingle when I move my head. Would definitely buy from this seller again."
5.0,"Cute shirt! Made out of a heavier material so great for summer to fall transition. The zipper in the back is a nice detail. I ordered a small, which is my normal size, and it fit really well. It is a fitted top, so if you are between sizes or have a larger chest I would probably size up."
5.0,this dress is soo cute !! i’m 5’2 and around 145 and this is stretchy and very wearable. it conforms to your body and it made me feel slim. definitely a good purchase for a going out night or a dinner!
5.0,"Was nervous about buying the off brand “Twisty Petz” but I wanted a cheaper version for my 2 year old so she wouldn’t take my older daughters’. I think it’s  just as cute, and so far it is holding up well."
5.0,Love the fabric & the color & it doesnt fit to tight to make me look fat
5.0,I got it fast! They were all very cute and high quality! Love it! No complaints.
5.0,"Oh my god, it’s adorable! I get so many compliments on my dress!"
5.0,Good Socks!
5.0,"This dress is amazing. I bought it as a Christmas present, and my friend loves it so much she asked me for the retailer's name to buy more dresses as she wants to buy more as it enhanced her figure while being very comfortable. She also loves that it has pockets. Great price for a high quality product!"
5.0,"Loved this dress so much, I now have it in 6 colors/patterns.  It goes well with leggings.  Very comfortable and enjoy the feel of the material!  I am 5'6"", and the length comes a little above the knees.  I am a full figured woman, and the body portion of dress is flowy.  The arms are fitted, but because of the material do not feel tight at all."
5.0,My nephew loves them!
5.0,This is a nice Astros hat for the price. It is one of lower priced authentic MLB caps.
5.0,Came on time. Product perfect. As advertised. I am pleased.
5.0,"I had cataract eye surgery with complications in January and these glasses help me with my impaired, hopefully healing, sight."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:776f8f12a6558b4c4fe0ab168247d8cf]] So far I like it. Especially for the price. I’m 5’4” and my face fits in the window. For taller people I’m sure you would have to pull the costume up a bit, maybe showing more of your ankles. It does have a plastic smell so I'm airing it out beforehand. I did not get hot in it, but I only wore it for 20 mins to try it out and the outside evening temperature was about 63 degrees. There’s an orange netting over the plastic face area which I thought this was odd at first. However, I could see through it and it hid my face more. The other benefit is when you walk, the costume will slightly lean back so when your face is against the mesh, you’re not sticking to the plastic. I like the look and the shape of the costume and the neck is a good thickness compared to some of the other costumes which I’m sure helps keep the head from bending over.<br /><br />My only cons is that I do wish it was a little less bright though. When I first opened it, the plastic felt thin. However, it does inflate in a matter of minutes so it seems to do its job. I’m sure the material not being too thick helps to keep it from getting too hot also, but I can see why people may have broken the zipper.<br /><br />At any rate, this will work for what I need. So far I’m happy with it, but I will update my review after my event if my opinion changes."
5.0,Love the American flag Montana west flip flops the straps are a little wide but I can live with that.  Very comfortable and beautiful.
5.0,Fits Perfectly and very comfortable - the quality is good and I was very comfortable wearing them for my Ski trip last week - I just loved them
5.0,Loved this item!
5.0,Great product. Comfortable and good material.
5.0,Love the material nice and lightweight! Length is awesome too. Very happy!!
5.0,Great great quality
5.0,The only thing I was unhappy about what the button broke the first day we used it.
5.0,"These goggles are superior to anything I've seen for children's swim classes.  The parents of the child I gave them to were in awe of the design and the little boy (5 years old) said he felt more confident swimming under water now, because his eyes stay more protected.  His other goggles would fill with water easily and the band that hold them on keeps moving around on his head."
5.0,comfortable and beautiful! Every time I wear this mask I get compliments and people asking where they can get one. It’s gone through the wash no problem.
5.0,"Authentic, great fit, over all great quality"
5.0,Thanks! They are perfectly tiny and I love them.
5.0,Very cute!  Happy with product.
5.0,I love them tbay are so pretty I bought an extra 2 as Christmas gifts
5.0,such a pretty shirt!! amazing quality!
5.0,Good quality.  Love it
5.0,Looks great in our guest house
5.0,It is perfect for my 5 year old Granddaughter!<br />Going to give it to her for Valentines Day
5.0,"On time,nice compact package. Really thick high quality goat leather.  Put it out in the garage to let the tanning oils volatile completely.  Quality on part with my Saddleback bags at 1/4 the price."
5.0,Got em on right now!  I ordered a size 11----normally wear 10/2.  Size 11 fits perfectly so would have to guess they run a little small.  They are very comfortable and I can now walk on my stone back yard with my slippers on!
5.0,"Seems like a decently constructed costume and looks good.  I should have asked about getting the shirt and the pants in different sizes.  The XL shirt seems like a decent fit, but the XL pants are huge in the waist for me.  Gloves not exactly as pictured and are pretty snug fitting.  I'm hoping they will stretch with some wear.  Holster also not as pictured and is going to require some mods to actually hold a prop gun.  They could have left out the ""helmet"", it is really not useable for an accurate look, but it is a nice add to complete the costume..<br /><br />EDIT:  Adding a star due to excellent customer service to get my pants sizing issue corrected.<br /><br />EDIT 5/30:  Here’s me in the costume at a con this weekend (helmet and prop gun were acquired separately).  Costume looks great and was well received by the other con goers.  Highly recommend it if you are looking for a Peacemaker costume!"
5.0,"Remember those Velcro strap shoes you used to wear as a kid and how it always gave you the perfect fit? This belt has the same concept except it doesn't make large noises and doesn't look tacky when wearing it.<br /><br />Perfect for those who are very busy and want to slip their pants on and go. You don't have to worry about inserting a piece to a specific hole; you just slip on, quick adjust and slap the two magnets together.<br /><br />It gives you the exact fit to your waist, unlike those traditional belts with holes where you have to work with an inch or half a inch of space<br />If you shed a couple of pounds its easy to adjust on the fly while around you waist. If you gain weight though there's some odd tugging when you have it on, so i recommend sliding in adjustable magnet to the end before putting around your pants.<br /><br />If you or those you plan to gift this to have metal implants like a pace maker i do not suggest purchasing this belt due to the powerful magnets involved.<br /><br />My previous belt had tons of wear and tear although sill usable, planning to replace it with this belt after one year of use. Not sure how long this one will last, I will keep you updated if it last under a years time.<br /><br />Overall the most comfortable and easy to adjust belt I owned in my lifetime."
5.0,"i got this a day early. which is great, i love amazon. when i opened it i totally thought i got ripped off. i mean its a piece of paper the size of a dollar bill. so i hopped on the internet an found out it does work. it is a piece of paper but in between the outer layers is a thin sheet of metal. that will set off metal detectors at the airport. so for ten bucks[shipping included] brings peace of mind."
5.0,These are great! I have to wear an N95 for 12 hours a day and they Sit comfortable on my face with the N95. They don’t fog up which also great and the bonus is they are pretty fashionable.
5.0,"The stockings came out of the package looking exactly as they are described. They are soft, and quite comfortable, yet can be worn over another pair of hose or thin socks if you want to for some reason. They are long enough that they could be worn with garters if desired, but they were used as normal hosiery without a garter belt. They can be used as intended as a part of a nun's costume, or as part of a goth alternative look, so they are more than one use depending on need and personal creativity."
5.0,Big and strong!
5.0,I got these for my best friend and she absolutely loves them and they are beautiful.
5.0,Nice product just as described already put on my US Army Veterans hat. 👍🇺🇸
5.0,The best bottoms I have purchased!! Comfortable and they don’t stretch out and get saggy like many other expensive brands I’ve tried. When/if they make other colors. I’d buy every color!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:b40265ebdc8af906051e79ff8d03ee36]] Ok so the material is great and no pantie line but if you have a big booth these one size fit all are not for you the legs and top of the panties keep rounding down and super uncomfortable I’m a size 14 usually a 9 in panties so if you have smaller thighs and booty this panties will be great for you comfortable and sexy
5.0,"My daughter is obsessed with the Encanto movie so when she saw this, she immediately asked my to get it for her. The costume is beautiful, and fits well. It's typical material of a costume, and I would say it's great for kids. It's not perfect, but as long as the kids love it, that's all that matters."
5.0,These cycling shorts are great!  Fit as expected and came quickly... they fit nicely under longer pants or shorts and make cycling for a distance much more comfortable!  Would definately recommend!  Thank you!
5.0,It was just what I was looking for. Very satisfied with this product.
5.0,‘
5.0,Good quality sweat pants.
5.0,My son loves his light up shoes he wears them to school everyday.
5.0,I love my necklace! I've had a lot of compliments.
5.0,"I got these liner socks to wear with a pair of dress flats which are pretty open. After walking around for quite a while in the flat with these liners, they stayed put and out of sight. They were very comfortable."
5.0,they are good quality fit well and very warm. lightweight and just what I wanted to wear everyday to work in a vermont winter.
5.0,My husband had similar socks in the hospital and he thought they would be good to wear without shoes around the house.
5.0,"Perfect fit, nice material"
5.0,Nice feeling material
5.0,"My size ranges from XS-M, but almost always S. I ordered M and I’m glad I did, as it fits quite well and a S would’ve been way too tight. I almost wish i had ordered a L so it could be a little bigger. Definitely recommend 2 sizes up for loose fit. The head hole is a tad tight but the rest of it is fine. The hoodie isn’t fleece lined so it’s thin but nice as it’s bulky and warm with the pouch. My 3 week old kitten swims around in the pouch but she loves it!"
5.0,Fits perfectly and it is comfortable
5.0,Just what I was waiting for!! Great fabric! Beautiful as in the pic. And very stylish. It also fits me as I expected.
5.0,Bought for my niece during Covid. Very pretty.
5.0,Great fit and great quality especially for this price! My son is almost 6 and the medium is the perfect fit- he has a little room to grow another year but not so big that it swallows him!! Great dial!
5.0,Beautiful Necklace
5.0,Love it!  Would totally buy it again.  Great product for the price
5.0,"Cool,they fit over my regular glasses."
5.0,WIFE HAS ME WEARING THESE ALL THE TIMES
5.0,Super cute jumper! Soft material... one of my favorite summer outfits
5.0,Calidad excelente solo compren 1 talla más de la que lleven.
5.0,"I travel constantly for work, often to Canada on projects.  Making sure I have my passport, the Canadian Nexus card (which is small and easily lost) and any other travel documents in one place is essential.  This wallet provides a great simple solution - it's not long/bulky like many travel wallets I've seen (those are designed to hold boarding passes, credit cards, passport, and other travel crap).  The leather is great with a soft hand, and the inside has several pockets that accommodate my passport, Nexus card, and a few other cards without making me switch to a larger purse.<br /><br />I highly recommend this wallet if you travel a lot.  It comes in a variety of colors; I got the blue as it is a great color.  The listing color is very true to what I received"
5.0,High quality and come with a case and a little cloth to clean them
5.0,"Bag is a nice size, seems to be good quality (I've only been using it for a week). I ordered the green & am happy with the color. Easy to keep organized."
5.0,Great presentation. His mom cried. Yes!! :)
5.0,Reviews from others stated that these Leggings run on the small side - so I listened and bought 2 pair one size larger than normal...They fit GREAT! and are so warm and comfortable that I almost forget that I'm wearing them.  THE BEST LEGGINGS EVER - and I immediately ordered 2 more pair.
5.0,Fit as expected on my 25-year-old son who is an avid Nike wearer. Ordered a medium.  The color combo is very attractive and the quality is excellent. I bought this and a pair of the Nike fitted tailored jogger pants to make an outfit of it for Christmas and he absolutely loved it.
5.0,Love it! Excellent quality. Magnetic clasp Makes it very easy to put on and takeoff.
5.0,These shoes are great. My son loves that they light up and are paw patrol. They fit him great. Overall great buy and i would recommend these shoes to others.
5.0,"I bought these earrings for myself to remind me of the wonderful road trip my late husband and I had taken through Las Cruces many years ago where he bought me a beautiful pair of Native American turquoise earrings. These earrings are exquisitely made. The silver is bright and shiny. The stone is set in a tiny silver trough and catches the light. They come in a pretty little box suitable for gift giving. This is a lovely little piece of art. In addition, the seller has thoughtfully included an extra pair of earring backs. I couldn’t be happier with these earrings and am looking forward to getting more for myself and my daughters and granddaughters."
5.0,I ordered black and was very surprised at the fit. The black is somewhat slimming on me (I'm thick and short) but it feels very comfortable.  The top part does roll down while wearing but it's not too noticeable.  If your girls are large this DOES NOT offer much support.  I will definitely need a strapless to wear underneath.  Material is soft and of decent quality and left me feeling cool while wearing. If you don't do standard bathing suits this is a great substitute.  Just go with a colored one if you don't want it ruined by chlorine.  I would buy again.
5.0,"Nothing like a Prayer Shawl from Israel the Holy City itself.  I love this when I am praying, Power in the cords and tassels.  I feel much closer to Jesus when I pray with this on.  I feel as though I have that extra protection.  I lay it on people to pray for them also.  I am so excited and very happy.  The Lord himself used this and I just feel obedient and like I am following in his footsteps.  There is Power in the Prayer Shawl, Wonder Working Power."
5.0,Very cute sunglasses at a great price.
5.0,Watch is adorable. What a great value for a children's watch. And some cute designs too! Perfect stocking stuffer.
5.0,Justo el estilo que quería y a muy buen precio.
5.0,"Hey, they really work!"
5.0,love the bracelet. Product as described.
5.0,Light weight good color nice with a tank top to take the chill off with out being over dressed
5.0,I was very surprised when this came because it was so well made for the price.  It also holds a lot more then I thought it would.
5.0,Perfect👌 😂
5.0,They’re so comfortable and so soft!
5.0,"I'm 5 foot , 115 pounds....ordered small and they fit perfect.  Love the color."
5.0,This is a must have! The material is soft and not see through. It is made well and the pockets don’t make you look more curvy. I wore with a belt and long.
5.0,"This jacket just arrived today and I love it! I ordered a Medium after reading all the reviews suggesting ordering a size up. It's roomy enough to easily wear a light top underneath, and the sleeves were perfect length. For reference I'm 5'6 130 lbs and while a Small would probably have fit, the Medium is very comfortable.<br /><br />The quality is very good and certainly comparable to jackets ranging in the $100-120 price range. The details are nice and stitching appears secure. The tie is maybe a bit long but that can be fixed with a slightly larger bow knot. I'm very excited to wear this jacket into spring!"
5.0,Pretty much exactly what I thought it would be!
5.0,"I love it, love it and love it. I bought a medium. I am 140 pounds. The colors are vibrant. Love the material. Looks expensive and classy, but the price is right!!!"
5.0,Love it fit perfect on my 15 month old daughter
5.0,Fits true to size. Material is good quality. Not too thin. Will be ordering again in different colors.
5.0,Live the look and feel of this swimsuit ❤️
5.0,"Cute, good quality. I bought it for my 16-year-old but it ended up fitting our 13-year-old ."
5.0,"My sister loved! And the color! Bigger than I expected, but perfect for hauling around work docs, books, can hold an iPad or 2."
5.0,One of the best sunglasses I ever had.
5.0,They are an excellent item.
5.0,Love the fit and the fabric. I was afraid it was going to be some cheap polyester material even though it said otherwise.
5.0,Just as I was expecting it to be. Great.
5.0,"First, I absolutely love this!  I highly recommend adding this piece to your collection.<br /><br />The fit is great - I'm 5'2 and 155 lbs and I purchased XL.  It just covers my bum and that's perfect.  Also, it's very classy and you can't tell it's open croth so that's a nice surprise.  The feel is very nice and your just going to feel very sexy...can't wait for my hubby to see it!"
5.0,Beautiful robe just as pictured. Furry and warm.
5.0,"Clings to curves, fits great just wish it was longer."
5.0,"Just got these, I have large calves so I got the large even though my foot size is 8 and they fit great!"
5.0,Great fit and super soft interior
5.0,its is for a little girl but very beautiful i love it
5.0,Love the shirts from this company. The size is true and the fabric is soft and thin. Great for the summer heat.
5.0,Me gusta el color que tiene esta blusa
5.0,Love the bag - got it for my mom. She loves the sections. It is a bit heavy which tells me its made of a solid good material
5.0,I have several piercings and use these as permanent earrings. They are great and I get lots of compliments.
5.0,"My daughter just turned 3 (37 lbs) and normally wears 4-5T. I am glad I listened to the reviews and ordered a 6-8 because it fits perfectly with a little bit of room left to grow. I think it will last her all season. Good quality, very soft. Satisfied!!"
5.0,"Still wear them, so pretty"
5.0,Gonna get these in every color!
5.0,cute as a button with class
5.0,Daughter loved for cosplay!  Cute and fit true
5.0,Love this shirt! Fits perfect!
5.0,Nice bag for stuff for watches
5.0,Picture perfect for our groomsmen! These ties were exactly what we are looking for at an unbeatable price! Thank you so much!
5.0,Excellent quality material for price. Nice compartment size.
5.0,"Nothing, absolutely nothing, beats this watch in terms of quality, ruggedness AND it's price!! Been using this watch for a solid 2 years, everyday, at the college, at the gym, at the part-time job in a gas station, travel, work as a sys. admin.(server and rack installations), in the rain and under hot sun (this is India) on my motorcycle and more! Nothing can kill this gem of a watch. After numerous brushes with walls, metal etc, the only scratch on the surface is really not noticeable. The strap is excellent. No sign of wear and tear yet. The light is sufficient in any dark area.<br /><br />My previous $40 from Timex lasted 1-1/2 years before the strap just rusted away with sweat. This is a great, durable, and really simple watch that keeps your time well. And at an incredible price. I got this for only $11. A thumbs up to Casio for this master piece!"
5.0,These gloves are fantastic.
5.0,Nothing bad can be said about this watch.  I can see it being to small on some peoples wrist but other than that you cannot go wrong.
5.0,This is the best over-the-calf sock I have ever worn.  The sole padding is great and the pressure on the legs are naught.  I will order again.
5.0,"These bands looks like the ones made my Fitbit, and they have an extra retainer loop"
5.0,Perfect in every way possible!
5.0,Very well pleased with purple earrings.
5.0,Love this wallet especially during travel.
5.0,Nice shirt but runs a bit big
5.0,Buy it! I missed the deadline to order it through the college but found it on Amazon HALF the price! Great material and very light! I love it 😍
5.0,I live in Wisconsin so our winters are cold. These tops are perfect for the base layer or just wearing them under your sweatshirt. The only complaint I have is that the sleeves are too short!!
5.0,Loved it giving to my daughter on her Birthday!
5.0,"This looked huge initially, but fit perfectly on! I've gotten so many compliments. I have washed once (air dried) and do not see any wear or damage. Well worth the price!"
5.0,Looks good but wrong color will be returning and getting a black one
5.0,Its so very beautiful! I love it!
5.0,"It came sooner then I thought it would, and it is bigger then I expected it to be. I got it for my best friend because it is her birthday and she loves it!"
5.0,I have perfect vision and came across these so started doing my research. When I put these on I could immediately see the difference. Very lightweight and after a while I forgot they were even on. I got the square style.
5.0,Absolutely love these jeans. Exactly what I was hoping for and they fit perfectly. As soft as pajamas for sure.
5.0,"Great quality,  very happy with my purchase!!"
5.0,I wanted a retro look & I got it very very pleased
5.0,"This is so cute! Looks like a real but tiny violin, and the case is authentic looking. Great gift for my violin student."
5.0,This bag had a very strange odor.  It wasn't an order<br />such as new leather it was very unpleasant.  Other than that<br />it would have been a great bag.  I would not recommend due<br />to odor.
5.0,Perfect exactly what I wanted
5.0,"Beautiful and very detailed.  Nice size. Ordered it as a gift, but might get one for myself too."
5.0,Ended up buying 3 . Super comfy and they look good.
5.0,SUPER DUPER CUTE!! I wanted something difficult for my cruise this year and although I'm over 50 yrs young and FABULOUS  . . .this is exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,Every time she wears these she gets compliments about every 5 minutes! My daughter loved these wings. I will say that they suck up a lot of batteries and the battery pack typically allows them to last for one evening at their full color... Two evenings if you don't mind them going a little dim.
5.0,Its so cute and bigger than i thought
5.0,"My hubby got this for him to workout in. The outer short seems short but it’s not, the inner part of the short is basically like biker shorts but all in 1."
5.0,"This is such a cute shirt. It is very flattering and comfortable. The material doesn’t feel cheap or uncomfortable. Overall, I would highly recommend it."
5.0,"This purse was a gift for my granddaughter. It is just the right size, She loved the color too."
5.0,I got this as a gift for my Mom...<br />She absolutely LOVES it!!!<br />It's a super soft t-shirt.<br />The sizing is a little off... I'd recommend sizing up!
5.0,I ordered this for my five year olds dance class. It is adorable and I immediately ordered another one in black. Exactly what she needs for her beginner class!
5.0,I wear these all the time
5.0,great product well made.
5.0,Purchased as a gift & it was much prettier than I expected when it arrived. Thank you!!!
5.0,Very good transaction and the glasses will be used for driving.
5.0,"He love them, great color, Navy and Gold."
5.0,"Like the fast ordering,fast delivery and products are always in great condition!"
5.0,"Easy to build, umbrella is huge!!!! Great for keeping the sun out.  I love it thus far."
5.0,"Very cute. My daughter will love it. Small in size, which is nice because it doesn't look gaudy. Looking forward to giving it to her for Xmas."
5.0,Love this hearing and the quality is really good!
5.0,bought for friends birthday...great--she loved it
5.0,"Well made, nice looking"
5.0,"True to size, beautiful design, adjustable, and great price."
5.0,I am 5'6 150lbs and I ordered a large. Fits perfect and is soft. Even my son wanted one but he said it looked too girly on him LOL I intend to buy more.
5.0,I love that these are so comfy and cute literally for any occasion casual or if you’re going out.
5.0,"This is the second pack of these masks that I have purchased, only a different range of colors this time.  They are pretty comfortable, have a filter pocket (I bought the filters on Amazon too) and the filters fit the masks well.  Very hapoy with these masks"
5.0,Great pants and super comfy.
5.0,"I love the zippered pockets,  they keep everything safe."
5.0,This is a beautifully designed Fedora Hat and it looks so handsome on my guy.
5.0,"These were fantastic! I used them during a 100 mile race in Arizona. When wet (ice was great in them too), they really helped keep me cool and protected from the sun. Additionally, overnight they were a great extra layer (when dry) for when it got a bit chilly. I will absolutely be using these in my future hot races!"
5.0,Super soft and light fabric!!  Perfect gift for dads !!
5.0,Cute summer dress with a pretty mandela type pattern. It washes wonderfully. I've had it one year and it looks like new.
5.0,"Uncle was very big AC lover antique tractor pulls. I got it to wear to funeral, really liked the adjustable fit and the quality of material."
5.0,Very cute! Fits great. I bought it big so she could wear it longer. We roll up the sleeves.
5.0,"Love these boots! Perfect olive green that I've been looking for!!  Ordered up a 1/2 size because of other reviews, but didn't need to. Reordered in my regular size and fit perfect!"
5.0,Great design. My son loves this shirt and wore it to their concert in 1/2019.
5.0,Fits well and very good material. Love it!
5.0,These worked great for my wife after surgery.
5.0,Very fast and quality product
5.0,"Beautiful, I gifted it to one of my friends daughter. She loved it!"
5.0,Love these earrings and a great company to work with :-)
5.0,Perfect fit. High quality. Better than any chain store product. Thank  you!
5.0,Love my skirt. It goes well with my top. Will be shopping for mine clothes soon.
5.0,"This is an attractive and comfortable blouse. The material is very soft and ""drapey"". It washes very well. However, I don't know if it is really sun protective because I haven't been out in strong sun since since I got it! Also, there is a deep ""V"" neck, which you'd have to cover with a scarf or something if you really wanted to be fully protected from the sun. Of course, you can use sun-screen too - and have it rub off on your lovely shirt."
5.0,"Light weight, big enough for the essentials needed for a quick day trip or running errands"
5.0,Hermosas
5.0,SO IN LOVE WITH MY BOOTS I WANT THE MAROON PAIR.
5.0,I bought these for my son as play shoes since the price was so good. They look of good quality and not cheap made. A little hard to get on but once on they fit perfect. My son is 3 years old and wears a 10 I order a 28
5.0,I love everything about this shoe!
5.0,Love the delicate chain. It is so light you don't even know you are wearing it. The chain met my expectations.
5.0,well made and true to size.
5.0,Good quality for the price. Plenty of pockets but keeps a slim light profile.
5.0,The most comfortable boots I have ever worn
5.0,I'm tired of people asking where I got it
5.0,"I love that you can wear this tank with or without a bra. Without doesn’t have a ton of support, but it can be done. And with a strapless bra makes the girls look good lol. The sleeves of any square neck line always kind of annoy me and give me the feeling they’re going to slip off. I had that for the first couple hours wearing this, but then I got more used to it and the sleeves never actually slipped off. True to size. The “brown” is more of an orange, but I saw that in the photo and that was the color I was going for. A great fall color."
5.0,Love it wish it was a lil smaller though
5.0,My husband loves this belt buckle
5.0,So impressed with these earrings.  I have a very expensive lace and leather jacket with a leaf design in black. These earrings match the leather leafs  in my jacket  perfectly. I thought because they were faux leather and inexpensive I probably would end up sending them back.  Not the case.
5.0,"Fits nice, looks good"
5.0,"My daughter gets more compliments on these pants than just about anything else in her wardrobe. Comfy & super cute. True to size. They are long, but she’s a petite, so expect to hem up if you’re not at least 5’6”"
5.0,Wonderful product! The craftsmanship is impeccable! Very warm as well! I will definitely be buying again.
5.0,Fits well. Very nice packaging. It is a thick gauge but not terribly just be prepared for the thickness
5.0,"I really like the soft suede-like feel, without it feeling too stiff like suede often does. Touch screen fingers work no issue. I have small hands and the fit isn’t too big."
5.0,Love the lgbtqia+ inclusion in this mask
5.0,It’s a very comfortable casual summer sandal and nice colors
5.0,"I can't decide if I like the design or not. Photos of it look cool, but in person it gives off a zebra vibe I'm not sure I like. The wallet itself is.. fun! It's thin and slick with a unique feel to it. You cannot tear the Tyvek. I can fit 4-5 full size credit cards in the slots perfectly, along with a condom in the side pocket and business cards and other junk in the flap behind the credit card pockets. Theres a lot of spaces to store stuff. Very interesting wallet and I am digging it. Sadly, the size of the bulge in my pants is still big due to loyalty cards and other bric'a'brac. Not the wallets fault tho."
5.0,These are perfect for what I needed to label  my playroom baskets!
5.0,I loved the colors and the clasps are study.
5.0,Great! Thanks!!
5.0,They are just right for to wear with my boots. Toe part is very thin. I have a hole at the seam of the toe on one pair off socks. I would buy more if I need to because they fit great.
5.0,Very nice rosary beads
5.0,bought for an end of year recital dance; fits perfectly; please note length in back is longer than length in front
5.0,"The shoulder detail really elevates this top. It's not an exaggerated puff, but basically a few well-placed pleats that beautifully, visually balance out narrow shoulders without the exaggerated effect of shoulder pads or giant puffed sleeves. The neckline is a modest but flattering, rounded-off V-neck, no cleavage popping out.<br /><br />I'm 5'10"" and the cuffed sleeves hit the bottom of my wrists. The hem hits the bottom of my hip.  I ordered up one size, to ensure it would not be clingy. I could have ordered my normal size, though, and still have it not be too form-fitting. I ordered the Wine Red, and it is exactly as pictured. The fabric is substantial, but not a sweater...think of a nice dense T-shirt."
5.0,The person we purchased this for was very pleased.
5.0,The style for sure!!! The fit is also good.
5.0,This onesie is true to size and I love how it looked on my child.
5.0,"Just got these to hold my hair out of my face sometimes. They're the standard size and weight of bandanas. Nothing special. Fine for the price. The colors are bright, as represented in the photos."
5.0,Love it. It hides all the parts you want hidden and appriately show the parts you wanna show. So cute I ordered on other colors. So far so good.
5.0,"I was nervous ordering from China. Most items come fitting incredibly small and nothing like the picture. This skirt is the exception! The color is darker and more mustard yellow than the image (I was debating between this and champagne and wish I had gone with the champagne now, but this is still a beautiful color), and the waistband is the elastic style shown in the second photo, not the smooth waistband shown in the first. Other than that, this skirt is perfect. It has several layers of soft tulle, hits right below the knee, and has a smooth, soft liner. So happy with this purchase, AND it came about a week and a half before the expected arrival date."
5.0,NICELY FITTED WHAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
5.0,Very cool - my niece loved it
5.0,"Great fit, nice shorts!"
5.0,I love this purse! Attractive and practical! I ordered it in black. Perfect size and the compartments help me to stay organized.
5.0,I HAD TO GET THE PANTS TAKEN UP THEY WERE TOO LONG BUT IT FIT AS EXPECTED..LOVE THE MATERIAL...
5.0,"This is my 2nd one - for my other car.  Yes, it will take time to arrive from China & it will be scrunched. If this is a problem for you, don't buy it. But it works great for me as I ride my horse in the Calif heat. I can't wear the hard Resistol type cowboy hat. I need something more flexible or my head will hurt.  I un-scrunch it by spraying it with plain water, stuffing the hat with a towel and flattening the brim.  The next day I shape the brim using the wire around the edge.  Looks great - a typical cowboy hat.  I bought the 1st one a year ago and it's still great. If the brim gets out of shape, I just reshape it with the wire. I put the cord in the hat when I wear it and only use it for very windy days.  Great hat for the price.  Lasted well. Fits my 7  1/4 head."
5.0,"I absolutely love this scarf, it looks even better in person.  I have received several comments from my co- workers and friends. I would definitely recommend this scarf and it goes with almost everything."
5.0,"My daughter who is 5 and wears a size 6, is wearing this dress, This is a medium and is a little large on her, my fault, I thought the small what be too small. She wore this to her preschool Christmas program with a sweater over it. We got lots of compliments, She loves the tutu on the bottom she was twirling all day. It was very comfortable She wore all day and didn't want to take it off."
5.0,GREAT LITTLE WATCH PERFECT FOR SMALL WRISTS AND VERY STYLISH!
5.0,Overall a nice bag. It’s smaller than expected but cute. The materials and the stitching were good. It’s a nice red or burgundy satin like feel for the interior. It has two small pockets. The bag has feet which is really nice. I’d recommended keeping a mini lint roller for the bag. Can pick up lint like no other but it’s worth it. Came with handles and a cross body strap.
5.0,Bellisimos..tamaño perfecto
5.0,"Wow, this dress is really nice and fits well. It's a thicker polyester and there's no give to it but this doesn't take away from it at all because it's a tent style dress that's very well sewn, feels lovely to wear, has a very nice design with darts, deep V-neck without being revealing, and shirred sleeves.  It's not thin or see through.  This dress is very flattering and can be worn in Spring, cool Summer nights, Fall and Winter!!<br />I bought XS and am 5'3&#34;, 120lbs, 35-29-36..the fit is perfect. I love this dress and if you're on the fence, just buy it!!"
5.0,looks amazing love the color and fits perfect. thought I would need an x large but large was perfect fit.  need more colors lmao
5.0,Granddaughter will love this to add to her charm necklace.The colors are bright as shown and the perfect size
5.0,"What costume doesn't need the full affect?  My grandson wore these with his costume, but also plays with them all the time with the Power Ranger games, swords, etcQ!  he loves them!"
5.0,Love that this fits exactly as expected!! That’s nice because sometimes you don’t know until the item arrives!!
5.0,Best quality!
5.0,"Fits my aviators and my prescription glasses, but not together. This case is a bit bulkier than other cases though. The marble colors are really pretty in person. The inside velvet scratches easily but thats not a big deal for some people."
5.0,Perfect . Shipping on time . Exactly what I wanted
5.0,comfortable but the underwire breaks easily.
5.0,Very cute dress and great quality. It is quite heavy.
5.0,Well made and nice looking
5.0,"Beautiful color blue, fast shipping & came in a gift box. Would definitely purchase again if I had to."
5.0,Everything I ored on amazon I have no complain Maybie only two so far but it's been great shopin here ..
5.0,Stunning design. Good attention to detail. I wear them daily!
5.0,Good quality material and very flattering!! Love it!!
5.0,"I love them! They are comfortable and long without being heavy. They match with just about anything I wear, dressy to casual."
5.0,Fit great and a good buy!
5.0,"These have been great, stand up well to constant use and washings. Husband uses them at work and I use them outside around the yard. Hold up well and comfortable, if a little big on me, but like them."
5.0,I love this stud!!!  I am a NOLA girl and this looks awesome on game days.
5.0,"I love these but I do wish Crocs came in half sizes. The size 6 is too tight so I get the seven and even though they are a little too long, they fit well otherwise. A 6 1/2 would be perfect!"
5.0,My daughter bought this set for her and I. We love them. The chains are sturdy and they look beautiful on is. We LOVE the rose and the infinity anklets. This is a great deal. Will purchase from her again if they have different selections.
5.0,"Fits and looks great...wore them to work already and didn't have no problems, which is a big deal for me cause I have plantar fasciitis in my left foot.  I'm a manufacturing supervisor, so I'm on my feet quite a bit.  With that being said I'd highly recommend these boots to everyone."
5.0,"Thank you Hurley for finally making a compression suit that doesn’t look like a sports bra! I am a 32/34 D, 130lbs and I usually am a large, but because of my small rib cage and need for support I got a medium and it fits PERFECTLY. Fabric is soft and color is very nice.  I plan to use this surfing and otherwise hanging on the beach. It is so hard for me to find swimsuit tops that fit, ESPECIALLY from typical “surf” brands. It’s like they think every woman is an A cup! And when they increase in sizes, the band increases so much that it offers zero support! Glad to see Hurley finally figured it out. I will probably buy this in another color now that I know how well it fits, as long as it doesn’t stretch out after wearing it a few times."
5.0,It’s cool! Very stylish. I like the color and the bamboo frame. And very light to wear too. I would like to buy more.
5.0,"Awesome item, quick delivery"
5.0,"This hat was so cute, the birthday boy kept it on the whole party! Definitely can be worn outside. Warm & comfortable."
5.0,Gift for my daughter's birthday loves them
5.0,"Im 5'7&#34;, slender build so I bought a small, and it fit me very well. Cute summer dress and my husband loves it so much he told me I needed to buy more!"
5.0,Really great ZENTEII WOMEN CANVAS Handbag Tote.I really like the style.Good quality for the price.Well made and perfect size not too big not too small.Very satisfied and fast service.I recommend it.
5.0,"I wear it whenever I can! It's gorgeous, functional, & sturdy!"
5.0,"Top quality item, love them!"
5.0,It's a Great Cover-Up & you can wear it out as a dress as well. Of course not anywhere fancy but just to run errands on a hot day it's perfect!
5.0,"I love this shirt. I wish threee was more design option of anime characters, because I would buy more of them. Comfortable and great to workout in. Highly recommend it."
5.0,"I do martial arts training outside year round.<br /><br />I have to comment it really is worthwhile to purchase the proper equipment to spend that much time outside.<br /><br />This hood is so much more comfortable and warm than a beenie I will buy another if I ever have to replace this do to wear & tear.<br /><br />It's also nice that it has different configurations.  Makes wearing with helmets, googles, etc. very easy."
5.0,I love the color and it is very elegant.
5.0,Cheap but attractive
5.0,"Very comfortable flats, my favorite work shoes! Runs a bit small, I'm usually 8.5 but after looking at reviews, I went for size 9 and it's perfect"
5.0,Very comfy and lite. I works for casual or dressy looks. Buy it!
5.0,Nice gift for my 8 year old grand.
5.0,"I bought this watch for when I'm working in the hospital. The transparent color goes with everything and it's super easy to clean.<br />It has a digital stopwatch too so that it's easy to use when taking vitals.<br /><br />I love it so much that I also wear it out as my everyday watch and I get so many complements<br /><br />I was concerned that it would start to yellow as some transparent/clear plastic products do, but it hasnt happened to my watch!"
5.0,I had to order every womens dress one side bigger.
5.0,This item exceeded my expectations!
5.0,My 12 months old daughter has a big head and the size 2-4 fitted perfect. Good quality.
5.0,"This is a very beautiful and cute tutu. I didn't expect it being transparent so you have my warning. I'm 5'1, 140lbs, and this fits me perfectly. I recommend wearing legging shorts under, since again as I said, it's transparent. Although, this is a wonderful product."
5.0,"I am a watch person and have many, many pieces in all price categories. I first tried this watch a few years back, loved it and started to wear it daily. It kept great time and is really nice to wear. It does not feel like an inexpensive watch, has good weight and is nice to look at. As a gesture, I gave the first one to a close relative I see infrequently; I missed it right away. So, I searched for another, found this and bought it. I won't be giving it up either."
5.0,Order a size up. This dress fit beautifully. I am normally a 10/12 or a large (36D busy). Decided last minute to order up because I figured I could adjust it easier if it was larger. But there was absolutely no need to. The dress hit all my curves just right! So happy I made this purchase!
5.0,Nice value and performance
5.0,Me quedo perfecto es muy suave y buena calidad  ordené una talla M
5.0,"I make angels for my patients that pass.  To make the angels personal I use their picture and charms of the things they liked to do, hobbies and associations.  The trucks are great for those who drove semis."
5.0,LOVE IT!!!  Many compliments!!!
5.0,This was so cute and fit my 3 year old perfectly.
5.0,Gave this to my son when he graduated from State Trooper School.<br />He loves it. It's a beautiful cut medal. Just the right size.<br />Manly.
5.0,My package contained the most beautiful assortment of colors and patterns; they all fit perfectly and match all of my outfits. WigsPedia even sent me baker's dozen! I couldn't be more pleased with my order. Thanks!
5.0,"Being on my feet all day, it is become more important to have some support sox.  These have worked well and for the price are unreal.  I usually wear Bombas support sox.  They are 4 times the price.  Copper fit sox are well worth the money"
5.0,Fit well made son happy
5.0,My 16 year old granddaughter will get her license soon. I decided to get her this keyring and I am very  happy with it.
5.0,So comfy to wear during summer.
5.0,Cute gift for a Y&R fan.  I bought it as a gift for a friend who's a huge fan of the show & she got such a kick out of it!  Nice size mug and obviously is good for any hot drink.
5.0,Very warm and stylish shirt.
5.0,"Excelent quality, price and service!"
5.0,I LOVE these pants!  The fabric is soft & cool & so comfortable.
5.0,"I think this ring does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the 1970's throw back glam. This beauty was designed by Providence Vintage Jewelry Co. It's made is with 18k gold, clear as well as red Swaroski crystals... It is simply breathtaking..<br /> I bought this glorious ring for a friend upon her Graduation 🎓 from her chosen MBA Program. At last report, she was VERY pleased with her remembrance ring..<br />  Providence Vintage Jewelry is a highly respected business who always puts the customer first"
5.0,"Love the fit, the Golds Gym logo and the hood."
5.0,It has stretch so the fit is perfect.
5.0,i saw a couple of negatie reviews on here and while taking into account what other people thought i took a gamble. All i can say is that since i bought this long men's cardigan hoodie it is absolutely my favorite hoodie to wear. Its not going to keep  you warm in a blizzard thats for sure but if you know how to do a little layering and throw this on top it is just wonderful! I bought two more in two diffrent colors because of how my i love my hoodies.
5.0,"This is so adorable!! Absolutely love it, well worth the money! My granddaughter is going to absolutely love it!"
5.0,Great item just wish I would have ordered with the 4mm balls instead of 3mm
5.0,Was a gift they were very happy with the hat<br />Just wish they could be located in the US
5.0,"great pair of ear rings, mom loved them"
5.0,"This is one size fits all and it can be cut off if you don’t need all the extra length. If I had to do it again I would order the plastic and not the metal clip because it’s heavy, but it’s really good quality, but that’s strictly personal choice. Nice tight clip and an elastic band to hold the extra length. I only wish that it came in “girly” colors. I would buy about 6 of them. This won’t wear out."
5.0,Ordered these when I got some new shoes and love them. Probably going to be the only sock I wear from now on.
5.0,"This ring is beautiful!!! I wore it recently and got so many compliments! The color is well represented in the photo...it is unique and eye-catching. I haven't worn it often,or for long periods of time so I cannot speak to its durability but it feels like a solid and sturdy piece. I'm not worried about tarnishing because it's not a color/design that goes with everything. This is more of a statement piece to be worn with the right outfit."
5.0,OMFG this is so cute! Things don't always look as good in pictures as they do in person but this one seemed to for me!
5.0,"I love this dress!!! I wear 2x and it fits so nicely around the waist it makes me look more shapely and the length is perfect I dont like showing my knees and this dress covers them well I'm 5'3 . Love the bell sleeves,nice material very comfortable.<br />I am happy I bought this!<br />Miss G"
5.0,"Great looking links. They also have the right number of stars and stripes. The material is of good quality, and the construction feels solid. I've been using these every time I need links now."
5.0,Adorable!  Perfect for a 5 year old unicorn party.
5.0,"This is probably the first time in my life I have taken the time to review anything. I LOVE this watch!!! Just as pictured. Perfect size for me (really not mini and still gives that trendy large look, but the full size Bradshaw watch I tried on in a local department store was so huge and heavy). Also ordered another mini Bradshaw with the gold face at the same time and this one is so much nicer! The off-white face is really pretty and goes well with my platinum wedding ring without having to do a two-tone metal watch. One thing I didn't realize is that the band itself is different too. This one is a much softer gold than the one with the gold face and looks much classier. As far as I can tell, this is the current model of the gold mini Bradshaw on the Micheal Kors website...just $100 cheaper!"
5.0,"Love this bag!  It kept everything very dry.  And it is super sturdy, hard to damage or rip.  Took it camping and it was able to fit all my clothes, pillow, gear and sleeping bag."
5.0,Very satisfied with my product! Very comfortable and I love the material!  I will be buying from here again! Shine On
5.0,Love them hope I can find something similar in sapphire blue.
5.0,"These are incredible for hot yoga/bikram. Way better compression and stays in place (compared to lulu, athleta, gym shark) and the jacquard print hides cellulite.  BIG FAN."
5.0,"I received a high quality pair of genuine Kaos Softwear earskins. Fantastic product with fast shipping. Completely satisfied, I will definitely be purchasing from you in the near future!"
5.0,they were better made and better looking than in the picture. I almost kept them for my wife. Would buy again.
5.0,"I love this sweater I bought. Its warm, comfortable and I waited a bit to write a review to make sure the color or material doesnt get bad too quickly. I love it! Works perfectly for me, especially up so high in the mountains."
5.0,Looks like the real thing & I ordred 2 more!  I think I will have fun with these this winter!
5.0,Product fits perfectly.  Easy to assemble and looks great.  Wore it to a job interview!
5.0,"I purchased this light weight, stylish robe for my mother and myself - NOT disappointed."
5.0,My son loves this jersey!
5.0,I had gotten this as a gift for my husband. He loved it.
5.0,"My daughter wears this belt with everything, she loves it. Most importantly it is durable and the material is very flexible. The colours makes it easy to wear with everything. People always stop us to ask were we found this belt. It is sized to fix so if you are a medium don't get a small as there will not be any length to play with."
5.0,So cute! Love these! Great quality!!!
5.0,"Love it! Very flattering. Got this in my size (medium), and it fits just fine. Would have prefered the mesh color in nude instead of white but it was nice regardless. Would definitely rock this to my next party.<br />The dress is very well made, sexy but kinda modest (some oxymoron there). Love the hourglass illusion, need a shapewear for extra oomph though."
5.0,"It is small and convenience. Really cute, easy to handle, and very roomy"
5.0,"I am all about my two boys running and getting their energy out in the house during winter but I am also so afraid of when they run they slide and fall or smack into things. These socks are great with the grippies on the bottom! They're also thick which is so nice for the winter. Just heads up it does make for a tight fit in shoes, but as for keeping their feet warm and their mph slowed down they do great! fit is true size! my 4 yo fits perfect with the 3-5 sizes and my 2 yo is swimming in them so I'll have to order a smaller pair for him."
5.0,Super cool looking keychain! I love how it looks and feels. It is very handy to keep my house and mailbox keys on one end and my car keys on the other!
5.0,Great value. Very pleasant to wear.
5.0,My daughter loved this walled!  It was a Christmas gift and she was very excited to receive it!
5.0,It really doesn't look like what you see.
5.0,I love this umbrella! I love that is closes inward to catch the rain!! I am so happy that i got it. The stars design is super cool and collapses to a tiny size!
5.0,"Good quality for the price, my son loves them!"
5.0,"I bought it for my daughter, she loved it."
5.0,"Just stunning I can't wait to wear it by the pool or on the beach, and I appreciate photos and sizing accurate."
5.0,"Top quality product.  Seemed to be a little big but am sure it will shrink slightly as it gets weathered.  Very warm, use it everyday."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful outfit......
5.0,These are adorable for my little grandson.  I got them for a number of events.  Just trying to be proactive.
5.0,"I have these shoes boots in 3 colors, and I absolutely love them!!!!  No complaints, fashionable, and comfy!"

5.0,The fit is excellent and they work great while I am on my computer or on my cell phone.
5.0,It got here pretty fast and it's soo pretty I love it
5.0,"I ordered the pack of 5 and I paid $33. For that price I wasn't expecting much but I decided to give them a shot based on the reviews. I wear a 42D and I ordered the 2XL. They fit great and and the fabric is nice agains my skin. The bra also gives the girls a pretty nice shape. Most sport bras give me a uni-boob. 👎 I'm not sure if i would consider this a high impact bra though, more medium. Don't think I'd do a 5k in it or anything. Lol Hopefully this company won't change a thing about this product, including the great price."
5.0,Really loved my pants✔️I'm 5 8 a size medium and the length was everything can't wait to wear! Thxs
5.0,"Love this Pendant, Subtle and Cool at the same time"
5.0,"Perfect fit for my son. We just finished watching the original Karate Kid in preparation for his 6th birthday party and he is elated to have this! Keep in mind, the graphic does not go all the way down or around, but it suits our purpose."
5.0,"Love these socks. I was looking for socks without seams,  because the seams in most socks rub on my feet, these socks do not."
5.0,"This dress is super soft and comfortable. It is stretchy and form fitting. The material feels somewhat like a Dri-Fit type material. I like that the arms aren't super tight. This would be cute with leggings or just worn as a dress. Could be easily worn with heels, sandals or tennis shoes. I am 6'0"" and 155lbs. So this works for tall girls too."
5.0,This is a great charm for any bag.
5.0,"It took me a minute to figure out how to adjust the size, but once I figured that out (the metal things go in and out of the actual ear piece) these were great for my 4 year old...a little smaller than some other ones we’ve had, but they fit and the price was right. We used them at monster jam."
5.0,this is my 3rd one. i love them!
5.0,This was a present for my godson he looked adorable
5.0,"This is a beautiful bag.  It fits everything I need: 13&#34; MacBook Pro, iPad, all charging cables plus any books or papers I need to carry with me.  It's also a great price for as nice as it is.  Solid construction.  My only concern is that when removing a computer from the sleeve, you need to be careful and open the bag pretty wide, otherwise, you're going to brush the computer against the zipper.  I'm worried this could lead to scratches all over my MacBook (this hasn't actually happened yet, as I've been careful, just a concern).  Great bag and I've gotten multiple compliments."
5.0,"This is used for opening the back of a watch. And for that, it does a great job! Durable, sharp, what the pros use. Love it!"
5.0,Fits great well made.
5.0,I love these little butterfly buttons. I have gotten a lot of compliments.
5.0,My husband loves these glasses. They have a flat profile and very light so he can stick them in his shirt pocket. The lens quality is good for reading in the sun. Great value for the price!
5.0,I buy it small it fit nice.
5.0,I really love these opal earrings! They are a great size and I get lots of compliments on them 😊
5.0,"Perfect for my almost 5 month old. Other socks have been too tight on her ankles and leave a mark, but not these! They fit her chubby little legs/shins comfortably with no marks. Plus the designs are cute. The value is also great for the price. Happy with the purchase!"
5.0,"I wasn't completely sure what my size was as I've borrowed rings from my sister and she said 7.5. I got 2 size 7 rings to stack. Love the fit, style and colors. My engagement ring is a teeny bit big and moves a lot especially when I'm typing on the keyboard at work. Don't want to bang it up, so this is a perfect alternative. Great for gym days as well. 7 fits perfectly, and doesn't slide around. Can't beat the price either...definitely recommend these!"
5.0,These fit perfect. Good quality. Great value. I get complements on them every time I wear them. Very comfortable.
5.0,It's great for winter running when the temps drop below 20 degrees.
5.0,The shirt look exactly as pictured.  Fit my husband perfectly.
5.0,It fits my small wrist!!!!
5.0,In love
5.0,These are awesome! My daughter loves them. She is 2 and a little small for her age so they were a bit big but I expected that since she is so small!
5.0,"Cute necklace, adds a nice pop of color. Fine quality, nothing super fancy."
5.0,"I really love this product. My ear has been pierced twice, never really healed on right side so it eventually closed due to not wearing ear rings. Got ear relieved with studex self piercing ear rings. Used hydrogen peroxide, didnt help.used studex ear piercing solution and my ear is finally healed. So yes, I highly recommendnthisnproduct"

5.0,Love it! Perfect gift for my friend who is a huge fan of Fiona!
5.0,It’s nice to find quality products. These light weight true polarized sunglasses are awesome.<br />The packaging they send glasses in is great.  Cool wooden box and some light hearted stickers. Not that that has anything to do with actual sunglasses but you can tell they care about their product and your purchase ‘experience’. Great job Woodies
5.0,Very pretty cameo.
5.0,I love the look and feel. I purchased them as gifts for my son & DiL for Christmas.
5.0,"I love sunglasses and like to keep plenty on hand, especially for the summer. I've got all different styles and colors. This particular style is one of my favorites. I like to wear them to the amusement park, they do a really good job at keeping sun out of my eyes, as well as off my face. They are big, but not too big. They are very comfortable to wear too. I sometimes have problems with glasses hurting the backs of my ears, but no problem with these at all. The frames are thick and the quality is outstanding. I would definitely order from this brand again, as well as recommend to others.<br /><br />I was provided a free sample of this product for test and review purposes. All opinions are 100% my own."
5.0,I work in a cold office and this sweater is perfect and looks professional.
5.0,"My newest day-to-day bag, and I'm in love with it! It's perfectly sized to hold the essential items I need (Nexus 7, phone, keys, wallet, wifi hotspot), and looks great. Construction is top notch, quality is superb, and it sits nice and snug against my body when worn. The strap is effortless to adjust for both tightening and loosening, especially while the bag is being worn (most other bags on the market don't do well, if at all). The chrome seat-belt buckle (a staple of all Chrome bags) is the crown jewel of the bag's design both functionally and visually. It adds a quick yet delightful way to put on (or take off) the bag in a flash without having to sling it over your head.<br /><br />It's great to no longer have a nearly-useless, mostly-empty bag flopping behind me simply to hold a few small important items!<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who only needs to hold a few, small items and doesn't want a big empty bag to do it with."
5.0,really really nice
5.0,These eyeglass holders are well made and are the right length . They are sturdy and you get a variety package. I bought them for my husband who is always misplacing his reading glasses and he is very happy with them. Can’t ask for a better deal!

I have loved everything that I have purchased from this brand .  In saying that I had to get this dress because it is super elegant looking and was apart of the Grace Karin collection.<br />  I wanted a dress that I could for church , business or out . I wanted something that would be light and comfortable . I also wanted to be able to wear it all year around .  I have a tendency to get over-heated a lot of the time so I wanted something that wouldn’t make me sweat too much .. this dress filled all of those needs .<br />  The dress fits like a glove .

5.0,Wow! Such a top of the line material. This was put together so well and did not look cheesy
5.0,It’s very beautiful!  A lot more blingy on the top than the picture suggests.  My daughter wears a 0/1 but we ordered the size 2 and it fits perfectly so it runs a little small.  The skirt is just the right length.
5.0,Like fit
5.0,"Not too tight, just order 1 size more than you are."
5.0,Xmas gift.
5.0,Shirt doesn’t shrink or fade when washed. Nice soft material.

Perfect for laying around the house or going shopping! The best part? The pockets!!!! The actually can hold something besides some change! If you don't get this dress I don't know what your doing with your life!!!!"

5.0,Love material and fit
5.0,"If you are looking for a ""Costume Accessory Sets Include Light Up LED Y Back Suspenders, Pre-tied Bowtie and Necktie for Festival Party..."" this set does the job.  It lit up and looked cool.  The tie is kinda small.  ***Flashy....Lights***"

5.0,Wearing it every day
5.0,"I bought this instead of a garnet because it looked better. The only issue I had was to get the clasp open. It was cold, once it got warm, it was fine."
5.0,"Color, thickness, and fit were perfect for a taller woman who has thick thighs."
5.0,Love these!  Comfy & seamless.
5.0,I like really like these and good price. I wear them to sleep. Small fit well just a little too long but I'm only 5'3&#34;.
5.0,Fits great and works as expected. Good quality and not too warm.
5.0,Love this dress. It is a heavier material which helps it fall well and not worry about undergarment lines. The v-neck is perfect for more modest occasions like church. I love this dress.
5.0,Got a wallet with no strap so I added this and it was the PERFECT wristlet!
5.0,"Wear these under shorts to the gym, but once I get home they are comfortable enough to lounge around in at home."
5.0,"Shirt looks very nice and feels good on, the only draw back is the care of the shirt. It is not advised to throw it into the washer and dryer. Hand wash and hang. I do love the look of the shirt and you won't find other girls wearing the same thing as you. I would purchase again."
5.0,"Literally been wearing these pants for days!!! I love the fit, very lose and night weight. And I’m all for the stretch🙌🏽"

5.0,Fun cats eye sunglasses with good readers. Very comfortable.
5.0,"Awesome sunglasses,  very comfortable and stylish. I would definitely recommend these to a friend."
5.0,THANK YOU!
5.0,"I really like these socks for when I’m working out. The moisture wicking feature really works. I immediately noticed the difference after wearing these the first time. There was no more blistering or foot pain after wearing them. They are very comfortable. Even though these socks are thick, they don’t make your feet hot. I’ve been wearing them on hot 90 degree summer evenings with no problems. These socks also help with performance. They provide support when walking. This helps for my flat feet. My walk time improves on days that I wear these. My only issue would be that they are long, and don’t exactly fit under leggings. Other than that minor dislike, I really love these socks!"
5.0,Comfy and flattering.
5.0,"Been to the top of Ben Nevis and Slieve Donard with them. Great support and comfortable, I'd say as good a boot as there is out there"
5.0,I love it! It works great.
5.0,"Great fit, good color and design. Shipped quickly and arrived earlier than expected. The thing I liked most about it is the seller used a Gildan tee to do the printing on, which means you will not get some thin feeling shirt."
5.0,Bought this for my engagement pictures. It fits exactly as shown in picture and I was very happy with this purchase.
5.0,It's the best front pocket wallet and it's very affordable too.
5.0,Great flowy pant. Very breathable and comfortable. I paired with a crop top. Love these pants.
5.0,This is probably the most comfortable thing I own now. The sizing was perfect (Large). 5”6 148lbs  Fit perfectly. This seemed like a return from someone else but they must have tried it on and it didn’t fit. Only came with one string for the sides so I need to find some. Aside from that it’s very high quality. Much nicer than expected. It came 2 days early too.
5.0,"I like the color and the fit...soft and cozy looking and I love the color, though I did try to get another in a turquoise color, but they did not have my size and I ordered up just on a hope, but it was too large. I was very happy with the gray one I got...reminded me of rainy day clouds. I felt a little sexy with the neck line as it showed just a hint of cleavage."
5.0,"I used this to fix a sleeping bag I have had for years; It is significantly better than the original.  I dont remember exactly what it cost, but it was no where near what a new sleeping bag would have been."
5.0,Love it. Wallet has the features I like. I can put all my cards in the slots. A space for cash and money.

5.0,Fit perfect and a huge hit at the Christmas party!
5.0,"It does run small. I bought a Large and it is a perfect US size 6. I am 5' 1"" 120# and a Large fit me just right and even looks a little fitted. I bought the army green and I like the color. Good value and I have been wearing it everyday over dresses or jeans."
5.0,My husband uses these with his reading glasses and really likes the way they attach to his thin earpieces.  Seems most strings are designed for a heavier frame.  These stay on and stay put!  Great product!

It has a nice look to them. It is flattering.<br /><br />It was very soft. It felt great on.<br /><br />The fit was good.<br /><br />It feels durable. I am pleased with the quality. It is reasonably priced. I would recommend this.<br /><br />The print was really cute.
5.0,"The Belabumbum nursing gown is exactly as pictured and fits perfectly. I'm 38 weeks pregnant and this is now my go-to nighty. I will certainly use it for nursing as well, I'm sure. Thought the price was a little spendy for what it is, but having one or two cute and comfortable nursing gowns was important to me and this was about as much as I was willing to pay. I'd buy another."
5.0,"Very nice clutch, not too big but not too small, definitely will fit necessities for an evening out 👍🏼"

5.0,beautiful watch!!  keeps great time and is just what I wanted!!
5.0,Love Olive&Pique!

5.0,Going to a convention soon and it's the perfect size
5.0,"Very high quality item. It will be good looking for years!<br />AND the CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING, IMPRESSIVE<br />and SPECTACULAR"

5.0,"My probably 11th pair of BSP. These are the first cropped I ordered.<br /> They can feel a bit small in the beginning but after the first wash and use they stretch and fit better. True to size and great quality.<br />You can’t get a pair of well made, high quality legging for 17$ out there. Great price!"
5.0,I love these earrings they look so high-end are affordable and match a lot of my neutral outfits.

5.0,Perfect gift to show someone you care.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:4c4ecc6dd161a75a82e76f662508dd2]] there is so much that I love about this dress, I don't know if I can contain it in a review without becoming a novel. first off- the color and design, gorgeous and very pretty in person as well as online. the color is very true to what you see on the product description, and the dress looks great in any lighting. the floral print and dress style give it a nice vintage look-which I LOVE. the sweetheart neckline is very well done, and the sleeves have that great box look to them, that easily fits in with mid 1900's dress style. the fabric is thick, but not too heavy, in fact its actually very light and almost feels nonexistent. I ordered myself a large, to hold on the side of caution, and can say this dress fits true to size, as I may need to take it in and sew some areas up to fit smaller, but I kind of like knowing I can fit this further in my pregnancy and maybe even after the baby when I'm still losing that extra weight. I'm 5'8 and this dress came to about my knees, and the skirt is full enough it can support a small crinoline or hoop under the skirt for a much fuller look. I received this dress for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
5.0,washes and wears well
5.0,This is a fun shirt. It is soft and fits well.

5.0,"Fit correctly, looks like the picture. Happy with this purchase."
5.0,I bought these glasses for driving to Myrtle Beach SC. at night. It’s a 13 hour drive from where I live. They worked wonderfully. They reduced the glare from the oncoming headlights and saved my eyes. They also work great as regular sunglasses during the day. They reduce the glare and brighten what you are seeing. I recommend theses glasses.
5.0,"They feel great. Been wearing them for a month now, very nice. Worth looking at if cheap.<br />Does it sold flat foot or anything like that. No. But better than nothing."

5.0,Always a great item!  We live in a small coastal tow with few choices to buy or access products. Amazon is our life saver and we can get exactly what we want or need.  Prices are always cheaper and the reviews tell us what users think or experience.  Thank you.

5.0,"These are the first compression socks I can stand. They come to the top of my ankle and have a good level of compression.<br />After a full night if dancing barefoot, I was in pain. I out on a pair and went right to sleep."
5.0,"I'm 5'8"", 135 pounds, and a size 4. I chose the size medium. This dress fits very well. Not too tight and the material is soft like cotton. It's very flattering and would hide any extra weight around the middle effectively. Great buy."

5.0,"This is the perfect handbag. It's roomy with pockets inside and outside. I am getting compliments and everyone just loves the fabric of the otters (these are the 2 otters that were holding hands, floating on their backs that went viral on the internet). The company that makes these bags is wonderful, environmental friendly and vegan too plus they love animals! I love, love, love their products and will continue to buy Bungalow 360 products!"
5.0,These are my favorite workout leggings and they are affordable!! I can’t stop buying them!!
5.0,"Awesome necklace, great quality!  Charm is really nice, looks hand made as th knot part is overlaying itself like it's woven.  It's perfectly symmetrical. Chain is really shiny and pretty too, it's a square shaped chain, perfect length for me.  I get compliments on this all the time, it's my new favorite piece of jewelry. And the price is so worth it, I feel like I got a steal.  Love it!"
5.0,great protection and fashionable
5.0,"The shoe is very narrow, had to be broke in a lot. Shoe also doesn't have any cushion, had to get insoles to provide  padding otherwise the cleats dug into the foot."
5.0,I Love this long lightweight sweated. It is perfect for knocking the chill off. I ordered and received a white one and a black one. I'm very happy with my purchases
5.0,These were exactly what we needed! We have a ton of wood/tile and in the winter if my almost 2 year old wears socks to keep her toes warm she’s slipping alll over just running around like a normal 2 yr old 😉 these were a perfect find! The non-slip grip is awesome! They are so easy to pull on and they don’t slip off! Great price and perfect for what we needed
5.0,Received this suit in a timely manner. I had to do some minor alterations because of my body type but other than that the suit fit as expected. Looking to buy a new suit soon.
5.0,"This buckle is even better looking than the photos. I would definitely buy it again as the construction and design are sturdy and appealing. Well made and solid, I look forward to showing it off on campus."
5.0,I absolutely love this bag. I feel so polished and professional with it. The color goes with many of my outfits. It’s quality is top notch. I have a 15’ laptop and it fits perfectly. There is plenty of storage and pockets for all my devices. One of my best purchases on Amazon.

5.0,Perfect gift for middle schooler. Was just as pictured!

I contacted the seller late on a Saturday night and they responded by Sunday morning with suggestions and a plan to track the package. I found the package and all good. I was very impressed with responsiveness. Product is excellent quality.
5.0,"The material is cheap, seems as after a few more wears it will start to peel."
5.0,Nose guard same as all the rest and less money. Delivered sooner than they had told me. Worked out great.
5.0,"Bought these for my nephew who loves butterflies, but I wanted something more durable than the normal wire wings made of gauze/tulle. These are thick and cushy and a little big bigger than I expected (nephew is three and he's still about a foot too short to reach the full wing expansion). But they're fantastic and they're bright and durable."
5.0,"Hi. I ordered this personalized baby kimono for my future grandaughter, that will be born in June. I can't wait to see her wearing it. And it arrived just as I expected, in beautiful bright pink and with the names I ordered it. Im very satisfied."

5.0,Love the fit and love that they were a higher waisted legging to hold all the things in!
5.0,Funny and perfect for my quirky uncle
5.0,"I was very happy with this purchase.  The dress was very cute for the 3 year old that it was for. The fabric in the top of the dress was soft and the design was really sweet.  The tulle skirt had blue glitter on it as well as shiny sparkles in the letters on the top part......which was a hit with my friend's daughter!! The fit was right on, so if you like a little room for your child's growth, you could order up a size, but it's not necessary."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress. I'm 5'9"" 146 lbs. It's silky, feels and looks great! My boyfriend loved it! Great for a night out."
5.0,Clients love it
5.0,"Great shirt, bought it for my son and he loves it!"
5.0,"This evening clutch surpasses all of my expectations.  It is stunning!  I was hesitant, at first, to order it because I feared it might not be as nice as I had hoped.  I've been burned before -- who hasn't? With so many crystals and such detail, if the workmanship isn't first-rate, the bag could arrive with some &#34;jewels&#34; already missing; if the materials aren't excellent, then it could simply look cheap and tacky.  It was a gamble, but one that really paid off.  I was absolutely delighted to open the package and find such a lovely, elegant bag.  Every crystal was intact (and the manufacturer also provides a little plastic bag with some replacement crystals -- just in case.)  I am planning on pairing this bag with a black evening suit -- a little jolt of drama to raise the outfit to something special. And now, to practicalities.  With all the crystals, it is a bit heavier than many other evening bags, though not, in my opinion, to a negative degree.  Also, the interior is smallish.  I would not expect the larger phones to fit inside. For example, my iPhone5, within its Lifeproof case, does NOT fit.  I would have to remove it from the case in order to carry it with me."
5.0,It's really comfortable and soft. It also have a calming color and the style is also good. Though the width is a bit large but that's all.
5.0,Lightweight. Comfortable
5.0,Very nice tank top. True to color and size
5.0,Fabric nice and well made. But way too large for me!
5.0,beautiful watch.
5.0,I bought this top for my 91 year old mother.  She is very active and leads a group of singers at her retirement facility.  They were putting on a Valentines performance and I wanted her to have something FUN to wear for the occasion.  She said she got TONS of complements on her NEW TOP!!
5.0,These shorts are great- so comfortable- I’d order more but other options were ugly
5.0,Me gusta mucho para salir
5.0,Arrived on time. Daughter was able to wear in a pageant. Reds are always so pretty on her. She still likes to wear it playing dress up which she can because of the low price

5.0,I love them. So cute and comfy!

5.0,"Every piece of this costume exceeded my expectations!  Extremely well made, and I am so excited and can't wait to wear it!!!!!"
5.0,"I thought it was going to be cotton but turned out to be a very cool light fabric, that was a great surprise and holes in the back for venting. My husband loved it!"
5.0,"Perfect and comfortable. Love to relax in home with this, or go out and have a nice date with the husband."
5.0,"I don't LOVE the fabric - I'm more of a fan of cotton with a bit of stretch, but this dress is too cute to not love. Pretty short, but for a beach vacation, you can't go wrong. Super cute. I'm 5'6&#34;, 128lbs and the small was a perfect fit."
5.0,Great hoodie!  A Merino wool hoodie that is actually thick and cozy. Large pouch pocket and nice larger hood. Great buy worth every penny!
5.0,it was a birthday gift for Betty!!
5.0,Workmanship is good and an attractive dress. Fits well
5.0,"I ordered two from a small business. The quality was unacceptable. The cost was $27.99 each - on sale! I checked on Amazon and was pleasantly surprised because they were $13.99 each. Upon receiving them, thhe quality was perfect! The tees are soft and look like they will fit well. I ordered them as gifts. Thank you, thank you!!❤️"
5.0,luv them
5.0,Wife wears medium shirts so I got this in a medium for her birthday. Fit perfectly.  Seems to be good quality. Wife really likes it.

5.0,"Over the summer, we often watch Jaws 1, 2, 3 ,4 or The Meg poolside on the big outdoor movie screen.<br /><br />Guests are given these bracelets.  It is their admittance to the pool club.<br /><br />Note: They are strong and come in two different tones of blue."
5.0,Clip on back not assembled correctly. Would not even open to use. Poor quality control. Junk
5.0,"better than expextected, I love it. It's just what I wanted and it lookes like a good quality"
5.0,Love this bag! Not to big or too small. Love the design too! Very pleased

5.0,Gift to my daughter
5.0,These jeggings are so...comfortable and accent curves perfectly! May appear to be too small when you first see them but they have a nice stretch! I highly recommend this item.
5.0,"I ordered these compression pants for my husband. He uses them when he plays basketball. He really liked these because they are lightweight, comfortable, ideal thickness, and a good fit. Please make note that the Chinese size chart runs a little smaller than the US size chart. My husband who wears a Large in US sizes ordered the largest size available an X-large and the pants fit him perfectly. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest assessment. This review is based on my own experiences with the product. If you have found this review and to be helpful to you, please indicate that with the “helpful” button, below.

5.0,These shoes are my wife's favorites. This is about the 4th or 5th pair I've bought for her.
5.0,Most comfortable jammies everrrr & they have pockets.  Super soft. They are a little long for me I can work around that. I promise you need these. I want one in ever color.
5.0,"Just received my new Halo Hinge hat, and so stoked! These hats do exactly what they advertise - they channel sweat off your brow and away from your eyes, all while looking sharp! Great as your go-to tucker hat or as a technical running hat with the nifty flip-down sweatband. As a runner, I spent years trying to find a product that would solve the messy glasses and sweat in your eyes issue before I discovered Halo Hinge. I recommend these to all my running friends, as I do their Halo headbands which do the same great job under a bike helmet. PS - had to buy a new one because my girlfriend adopted mine, she likes it so much..."
5.0,My mom is going to love it for Mother’s Day! It looks just like the picture.
5.0,I got those to use for my daughter's choker necklace. It is almost a perfect fit in both thickness and length. I wouldn't recommend these for an actual belt though.
5.0,I am always looking for extra bands for my Fitbit and I came across this one and it's perfect for when I want to dress my Fitbit up.
5.0,These are good cheap sunglasses. The lenses pop out easily for cleaning. They are black with a small blue detail on the side. I have gotten several compliments on how they look. Lightweight good looking and sturdy enough.
5.0,Winter has hit New Jersey and I realized I only had short socks.  I saw these on Amazon and I am very happy with the feel and fit.  I am a 6.5 and often the heel of the sock is off.  These fit well!
5.0,Fits very nice!!!!
5.0,Happy with the product!👍
5.0,"Finding the perfect Hippie hat... priceless.<br />You will not be disappointed.  It’s lightweight, blocks the sun and holds the shape you want.  It’s curvy in all the right places... soft and distressed like you’ve had it forever and have broken it in perfectly!"
5.0,I love this dress! I should have ordered a &#34;Large&#34; size though instead of XL because it is a little loose on me. I usually wear a size 10-12.
5.0,Very nice. Got a pair of these as winter set in and love them. I wear them as a scarf daily and have even used them as blankets when my office is too cold. Plan to use them in the summer for sun protection while hiking. Very pleased.
5.0,love!
5.0,Arrived when expected. Even cuter then I thought. Super happy with my purchase.
5.0,They were liked by the gift recipient
5.0,"Love it.  Only negative is the length of time it took for it to be shipped.  It came from China, so it took a while.  Now that I have it, I love it."
5.0,Very cute. Exactly what i wanted. I wish the skirt was a little fuller. I bought i little tutu to pit underneath to make it look fuller
5.0,"nice light fabric,keep cool in hot days.Very cute, my daughter is asking for another one on the day one she put on! strogerly recommend order one size up."

5.0,This is a great cap and fits great.
5.0,My glasses fog bad and this has helped greatly
5.0,I really love it but its a tad too big and the tail hangs below my bottom so I need to raise it up..I'm a good seamstress so it wont be hard to fix.
5.0,Super cute! Light weight and cutw
5.0,"I got these as a gift for my very petite girlfriend. She wears a women's size 4 shoe at largest, so it's hard to find socks that don't have a lot of excess room in the toes. However, these socks fit her perfectly. It also didn't hurt that every pair was adorable and sturdy (what you see in the picture is what you get). Overall she loved them."
5.0,Beautiful and elegant bracelet! Very good workmanship
5.0,"They are a little bigger than I expected, but my daughter-in-love enjoys them. She says they're perfect. They are well made and look great."
5.0,They work as well as the one that came with  the watch.

5.0,I guess chokers are back in 🤗 my 12 year old daughter loved this.
5.0,Very nice clutch.
5.0,"These are not shiny, bright gold. They are more understated brushed gold.<br />They come in a giftable box and were well secured from damage in the plastic bag inside.  These come with a simple plastic plug for the post, but I changed it out to a flat back one.  They hang nicely and are not heavy at all.  They have a nice swing to them.<br />Really pretty and look far more expensive than they were."
5.0,Worth the money.  High quality dress boot
5.0,Worked out perfect. Good quality. Exactly what I looking for.<br />I like the foldable handle on the end.
5.0,Grandson loved his Batman jacket
5.0,"This apron is a great fit for plus-size cooks. It protects my clothes, and dirt washes out easily. Just throw it in with your other laundry. It does shrink slightly when washed. Keep that in mind when you try it on for the first time. I am sure I will use it for many years."
5.0,Groovy glasses
5.0,Great way to organize your clothing and staying organized
5.0,Fast deliver and comfortable fit!
5.0,These are very small as in baby size

5.0,"I LOVE these pants.  They fit beautifully, they  are very slimming, and the fabric has a perfect amount of body and stretch. They have become an essential staple of my wardrobe--I wear them to work, for dress-up and for traveling.I'm delighted to have found them."
5.0,Super cute and comfy. Lightweight and durable.
5.0,Literally everyone asks me where I got this when I wear it out. So cute.
5.0,"These are awesome, if your a person who sweats a ton and are tired of wringing out halo headbands during your rides this is your best option."
5.0,"The product was as expected. Good fit, but slightly on the small size but comfortable nevertheless. I would like to see it in a variety of colors, I would buy a couple more."
5.0,"Bought to match my wedding ring. Excellent build quality, brilliant ceramic bezel. Great deal"
5.0,"My daughter ordered this and just loves it. She says it’s comfy and soft and goes with everything. (She’s 13, 5’5” and ordered medium)."
5.0,Beautiful dress it fits well
5.0,This romper/overalls are so  cute!! The material was really nice too! I did end up returning it only because I have large breast and felt it looked a little weird lol. But the quality and style is there!
5.0,I got this as a gift and he absolutely loves it.  The size is perfect and it came on time.  I'm very happy with this!
5.0,Loved it so much got 2 more in this style.
5.0,This sweatshirt makes you look like peely Great fortnite character
5.0,"NOTE: I lead yoga and snowboarding adventures as part of my job (Hokkaido Japan Feb 2020 if anyone is interested, see jaycoyoga.com). I got these free to try from the seller in exchange for an honest review, just to be up front. I use gear from big names but also use a lot of gear from smaller brands too. Ultimately if I like it and it lasts, I use it.<br /><br />REVIEW: I got these for my wife. These pants are really well constructed for $40. The seams are great and my wife really loves the fit. She said the waist adjustment is fantastic, holds well without bunching the waist. These have a great amount of give so bending her knees deeply is no problem. We'll update our review when we get the chance to actually get out in the snow with these pants, but initial quality and material are really something for the price point."
5.0,"These earrings are perfect size, light weight. Well made, and I love them!"
5.0,"Very cute vintage dress, good quality. I ordered a medium and it fit a little loose but it doesn’t look bad. I am 5’2 & 140 pounds, usually medium fits just right but this one didn’t hug all my curves."
5.0,Nice festive birthday.  I purchased these for my tween for her birthday - she wears them all the time.  A great value!
5.0,Custom orthotic
5.0,"Love them<br />Works great, no leaks"
5.0,Best decision yet
5.0,"So cute and comfortable, I wear a size 9 shoe, fits perfectly"
5.0,Love them they are difficult to put on but with practice it works
5.0,Love my vest.  It looks better than pictured.  Fast delivery as well.  Thanks
5.0,Nice quality faux fur hat at the right price.  It look well - I wore it with a real fur coat and it was just fine.
5.0,This dress is SO comfy. I want pockets on every dress now! The fabric is soft and had held up well after multiple washings. I can wear the dress without a slip and not worry about showing too much. The perfect dress to add different cardigans and jackets to.
5.0,i like that it is as pretty as advertised.
5.0,"Love the length and the BOHO feel of this product,  Colors and design are well thought out.  Shipping was faster then expected too,  Best of all this is a feel good item that helps others with its purchase,"
5.0,"Love these socks.  Even with the dog image, they are smart and in good taste."
5.0,"Tiene buena tela, cómoda, muy práctica."
5.0,"pretty.  like that it can be worn as a bracelet or necklace and that there are no metal fasteners or findings to get tangled in my hair.  color is just like the picture, on my computer.  everyone's computer settings are different so that may not be the case for someone else."
5.0,"Super cute! I wore them to my friend's wedding in Hobbiton and she liked them so much, I gave them to her so she can wear them to her home wedding party."
5.0,My friend loves this and wears it all the time! Great color!
5.0,"this is a great little wallet!  It will fit in my purse, the bright red makes it easy to find and the quality seems to be very good.  I bought it because someone had written a review saying that this one would not read her work pass through it while others did so I think that speaks well for it's being able to perform as it should.  Shipping was a little slow because UPS delivered to the USPS and the package was delayed somewhere along the way, but I don't credit that against the seller.  They have delivered a good product that seem to be all that was advertised."
5.0,Love the support and fit.
5.0,Awesome!!!!
5.0,The design is perfect !
5.0,"Fit just right, very happy with them."
5.0,My son was very happy with these. I like that some are collages of the here is and others have the hero emblem on the side of the leg instead across the back where he wouldn't be able to see. Fits as expected. Great so far. The
5.0,"the bracelet came very quickly, and was just as cute as can be, very nice bracelet for the price!"
5.0,I have used Casio watches similar to this one for many years and I love them.  It's easy to read the time day or night and I like that they are water resistant.  What I like most is how easy it is to change the time or set the alarm on this watch--no need to refer to the owner's manual--it's very intuitive.  I will buy this watch again when the battery runs out.
5.0,Items received in good condition. Fits my petite gal perfectly.
5.0,Son loves it . Ordered size up and fits perfect. Great material
5.0,"I was a bit leary on ordering this as it didn't have any reviews yet (Yay I'm the first!). It looks just like the picture and is super comfortable and easy to put on. Already ordered another one in a different color, and will probably get another after that! Very disappointed they don't have it in blue though."
5.0,"Comfy, stays on all night."
5.0,Got this for my wife. Fits great and looks fantastic. Good quality. Great value compared with other online sellers.
5.0,For working out. The product quality is excellent way better than expected.  Try to have this design in different color options with same black supports.
5.0,Absolutely love these for around the house. Very soft and comfortable and roomy enough to wear think socks in.
5.0,I loved how they fit and feel they are very nice to wear.... I will buy more of them......
5.0,Just perfect! Color is exact. It is super comfortable to wear daily and sleep In. Would reccomend.
5.0,Bought this for my boyfriend now he finds excuses to wear a tie.
5.0,This belt is 'vintage' indeed and very comfortable. Fit was large but was able to add holes at shoe shop.
5.0,"They are weird when you are looking at your phone though, has a weird effect that hurts my eyes. They are fine to look at everything else and feel okay on the eyes on sunny days. We've had lots of sun and these sun glasses do shade nicely without making things depressing or overly dark like some grey lenses. I like the amber, bright driver style color, and appreciate the polarized effect for seeing into the water and being able to see through the glare and see the fish below the shiny surface. That's really fun. But, looking at the phone is crazy.  Good value for standard, dime store glasses. They come with a really nice case and they fit well. They are comfortable and stay on my face when I bend over. I like them. Big Hollywood style."
5.0,Ordered these for my 5 yr old son..he absolutely loves them. I did order a size larger to allow some room to grow.. Im glad I did as they seem to run a bit small. They are super soft and adorable!
5.0,These look sexy on my chicks little feet.another look besides black ones and white ones
5.0,"This bag is great!  The measurements are accurate. The bottom is stiff like the sides, but it doesn't have a ""hard surface"" as stated in the information so it folds more easily than I thought it would.  The inside has a waxy (for lack of a better word) finish so it won't let moisture through although I won't go so far as to say it wouldn't leak a bit if a gallon of milk spilled in it.  It holds a lot.  It stands up pretty well by itself so it will be easy to load.  There is one pocket on the outside. It will be interesting to see how it holds up over time. Next stop: grocery store!"
5.0,My daughter loves it so much she goes everywhere in them they’re so soft so comfy and easy to clean great shoes.
5.0,Words cannot describe how beautiful her name came out! I can't wait to give it to her!
5.0,Gave as a gift to my daughter! Perfect Fit!
5.0,Used effectively to reduce size of my wife’s hat.
5.0,"Great fit. high level of comfort, zipper is easy to work and stays put thanks to the Velcro strap. high laces make a snug fit. All day comfort and great ankle support."
5.0,this was a great Christmas gift and looks well with other pieces sim ilar.  Use jewelry sealant to keep from tarnishing and leather oil to keep from fraying
5.0,"These are just as comfortable as the original Apple Watch silicone bands, and appear to be just as durable.  I wear the longer band included with my watch, and the longer size of these fits me very well.  I wish they offered even more colors."
5.0,Super comfortable and fits small or large faces with the adjustable ear loop.  It is quite thin though so recommend adding a filter in the built in filter slot if using for face protection from COVID.
5.0,I am thrilled with these jeans! They are such a perfect fit. They sit great on my waist and are a nice material.
5.0,Love this bag and all its storage ability I will definitely be ordering more from this company it has been extremely durable as well .
5.0,We needed protection from the harsh desert sun when hiking in Utah.  Did the job nicely although the sleeves we rather long.  Since we were camping we rinsed them daily and the fabric dried quickly.  Would definetely buy again.
5.0,Everything i was looking for to wear at our wedding! The bolo tie is the perfect size if you are wanting something noticeable but not overwhelming.
5.0,I really like this a lot. All the different cuts in this chain really makes it sparkle in the light. The chain is substantial. It’s comfortable to wear. I bought the 24 inch length. It’s perfect in length as advertised.  The pictures they posted in this listing really don’t do this chain justice. It is beautiful! There is some print on the lopster clasp but it is way too small for me to read. I took this chain to a jeweler to see if it is indeed sterling silver. Two people took a look at it and they thought so. They didn’t really have a way to tell for certain there but they didn’t see anything to indicate it was fake. They said it had a nice weight to it and it looked real. There is no pull when I did a magnet test at home of the actual chain itself which is what your looking for. Silver does not react to a strong magnet. There was pull to the lospster clasp. So that may not be real. I am overall happy with this purchase. I received this yesterday. I will update my review if something changes. If this holds up over time I will come back and rate 5 stars. I may even by another  in a different length.
5.0,I love these! They're exactly as advertised. They took about 3 weeks to get to me but are well worth the wait.
5.0,High quality.
5.0,"I love the way the dress fit all over, very comfortable! I would buy one in every color!"
5.0,Very colorful and comfortable.
5.0,Smelled a little chemically when arrived but no problems now.  Good value with slouch
5.0,"The sandals is clean and of high quality for that price,i will always recommend it to any friend.Keep up with good job ,just continue with it."
5.0,Great little watch
5.0,"These are striking! And yes, the heel is really as high as it appears.The first time I bought these, I bought my regular size, which were way too big, the second time I bought a size smaller. They fit well, just a tad wide, but they are actually comfortable! I wore them all day, even climbing up and down a flight of stairs multiple times!"
5.0,This was exactly the right size
5.0,Good quality. Not a real wrap skirt it actually zips but you still have the tie side. A bit short. I’m only 5’2”. Size medium.
5.0,Look darling on.
5.0,Good size for my 2 year old son. He loves them.
5.0,"I used to just shove everything into my laptop sleeve and cover it with a thin mousepad. Of course, everytime I tried to put my laptop back into the sleeve, all those things just slid down to the bottom. This keeps everything all in place so I really only have two pieces of things in the sleeve. It greatly organized everything I needed. Some of the straps are big enough to hold the entire laptop power supply."
5.0,"These are cut a bit on the large size, which I like because they don't fit tight against my mouth, or restrict breathing in any way. The adjustable interior nose bridge makes for a perfect fit, and my glasses never fog up with these. I've been using them for a few weeks now and they are holding up well. I am handwashing as a precaution because I've had other cloth masks fall apart in the washing machine, and I really like these and want them to last. I get lots of compliments on how cool they look when I wear them. I would purchase these again."
5.0,"Unbelievable quality, I can't say enough about this product it was perfect. The price was unbelievably inexpensive.  So I wasn't sure what the quality would be.  I was so shocked at how nice these were"
5.0,"I bought the 2mm size, and they're exactly as described, look very dainty and cute. In hindsight, I could've gone 3mm or 4mm, so that they'd make more of a statement but all in all, a very cute little pair of earrings."
5.0,Great arch support! Runs a little on the bigger side but still fits if you use the bigger arch support insert.
5.0,"After reading the many reviews on here regarding size, I wasnt sure if i wanted to go bigger or stick to my size.  There was a $10 difference between the 2 sizes I was debating...the cheaper one being my size.  So I took the chance and ordered my size for $10 less.  I'm normally a 6...most comfortable in a 6w really cuz I have a bunion but usually manage to squeeze my foot in a regular fit most of the time.  When they arrived they fit perfectly.  Literally.  They slid right on.  I even had room to wiggle my toesies.  I wore them for about 4 hours...comfort is a whole other story tho.  But last time I checked, anyone buying gold glitter pumps wasn't looking for comfort!!  ;) amirite?"
5.0,Love Charlotte flair
5.0,"I love these! I don't have a lot of booty, but these make my butt look INTENSE lol. I normally wear a size medium, which is what I ordered, and they fit perfect. I also ordered the light grey which was a bold move considering how thing/see-thru some reviewers were saying they are, but they ARE NOT. I've even had people check when I'm squatting and lunging at the gym, and everything says they are fine. Just ordered in another color! Only precaution is that they give the illusion of a little bit of camel toe, since they wrap into your booty so much."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:1c432bed8eb59778ac158d14f95ddd]] Okay WHATTT!? Did not expect these to be this great. Idk if it’s the shading or what, but my booty looks peachy & my booty is not that peachy."
5.0,"This fit my 12 year old daughter""s head so I just gave it to her."
5.0,This watch has tremendous presence in brown colour.- this item has monthly references with heavy solver tone bands.<br /><br />It is different!
5.0,"Bought this for my third grandchild and it really looked better than the picture showed, we also got my other two grandkids shirts to match, we loved it!"
5.0,This is our first time ordering this product and we are completely satisfied. We found this to be a higher quality than expected and would highly recommend.
5.0,Hysterical!  My husband can't wait to wear it for Halloween!  My daughter thinks it's so funny and can't wait for it to become hers to play dress up with after Halloween!
5.0,"Soft material, fits everything I need in my wallet perfectly."
5.0,These sunglasses are fantastic looking. The quality is good at a great price. Just a perfect gift for my wife's birthday :-)
5.0,If you like Mick Jagger you will love this shirt! Rolling Stones forever!
5.0,Smokin' hot!
5.0,So cute to wear for Halloween!
5.0,I wear an 8 1/2 but ordered an 8 because the size guide showed 8=39 EU.  They fit perfectly.  Other Docs I've had were always a little big.  Wish I'd paid more attention then.  Very cute and comfortable-have had lots of compliments.
5.0,"These run large, but I knew that going in after reading other reviews.  My daughter is 9 months old and small for her age.  I bought size small, figuring she would grow into the sleeper.  I figure it will last another year or so.  the ankles are a bit tight, but they don't constrict her in any way. The material is very high quality, as is the construction.  I would definitely recommend ordering these, just keep in mind they're coming from South Korea so delivery takes a few weeks."
5.0,"The compression sleeves fit comfortably, not too tight, but a nice protection from abrasion and UV rays.<br />They give gentle support to arm muscles, wrist and elbow.<br />I found that the wrist/thumb section can be folded up neatly if more hand and finger freedom is desired.<br />Easy to wear..."
5.0,Expensive but they work
5.0,Has saved me from playing all my winnings away.
5.0,Very pretty<br />Very dainty<br />Perfect for layering necklaces.
5.0,"I love tapout brand shorts as it was started in my hometown and I do mixed martial arts. I like how they are long and it makes me look even more like BJ Penn who is my favorite fighter. Did you know the WWE owns tapout now?! Cool, sleek, relaxing shorts"
5.0,It’s absolutely beautiful and went perfectly with my daughters prom dress!
5.0,It's very wearible & very fine item Thank you.
5.0,"Perfect dry bags. Thank you. If I ever need more, I'll look you guys up"
5.0,Bought them for my 8 year old daughter they were a little long but she loves them
5.0,Great to exercises
5.0,Runs very small. I usually wear a large no problem and ordered  the XL In case of shrinkage or being too tight. Ensure you order bigger than normal size for this item.
5.0,Excellent product !
5.0,They were a little bit looser then I wanted but it was fine. Very comfy!!!
5.0,best pants ever
5.0,Great dress and nice fit.  Flowy and cool for the summer heat and not snug at all. Size L worked for me.
5.0,"Nice bandannas, with a quality feel to them."
5.0,"this super soft shirt is a keeper. it is on the thin side, I got yellow and can't wear it alone, a bit see thru.  but since I bought it to wear as an undershirt it is perfect!!!  also wear it with a partially zipped or buttoned top.<br />you can't go wrong with the soft merino, I wash it in the washer on cold and hang it to dry.  dries very fast, and with all merino, if you don't get it to the wash, no problem....no stink!<br />I have other undershirts and sports bras by this company, love it!!"
5.0,"It is a great hat, fit comfortably, feels very comfortable, and looks great too!"
5.0,"I looked all winter for slippers, even tried Ugg moccasin slippers, but none were comfortable. I need a slipper I can wear much of the day in the house, since I have a home office, but also have a good sole to walk outside in. They also need to last a while, which I'm hoping these will. My last slippers from Land's End lasted 5-6 years. Because these slippers run small, I was able to buy a men's 8 on sale for $20 at REI. I am very happy to have new slippers, since the Land's End style I had is no longer available, and now I have comfortable slippers without holes in them!"
5.0,"I normally wear US M, but after reading all the reviews. I got US S, and it fit perfect, great style, all my friends like it. I'm 5'8&#34;, 160 and workout with an athletic build. So far the material has held up after 3-4 times wearing it."
5.0,So cute great quality
5.0,Ty love them
5.0,My favorite glasses. I have owned more than one pair at a time.
5.0,This is the softest t-shirt I've ever worn!
5.0,This was a great first costume for my little man and fit just as expected on the size i ordered despite the chunky size that he is it was adorable to go with my daughter's dori costume so they could fit together for Halloween
5.0,"Really cute sunglasses. I've never bought a pair online, so I was a little nervous because I have kind of a small head,  but they fit great. The carry case is nice too. Doesn't get better than $30 for a nice pair of shades! I also love that they're polarized."
5.0,"Bought this for my wife for a party that got canceled. I suggested we return it, but she said, ""no we can't I love this dress!"" So I shall submit this review as a 5 out 5 rating."
5.0,"Great traction. Live in Alaska, so<br />Very slippery. A little tight around the calf’s, but still look nice. Aren’t uncomfortable, and get lots of compliments."
5.0,Small. Use 4XL
5.0,"This is my second NaviForce watch.  I really like them both.  Comfortable, keep time well, and look good"
5.0,My daught absolutely loves this hat she wears it everywhere and makes people laugh and they always ask me where I got it that there daughter wants one it's adorable!
5.0,I bought these for my daughter and they are really cute and comfortable. The fabric is like your typical workout legging material. They was well and people asked her if she got them at LuLuLemon
5.0,Excellent shirt for the price. Will buy again
5.0,"Anyone who hasn't tried this type of belt owes it to themselves to try it. It seems to be a very good quality but I will let time determine that. It offers the ability to adjust its size in much smaller increments effortlessly. Having tried it, I bought a second."
5.0,My daughter loved the backpack.
5.0,Beautiful and stylish and a great price for the product
5.0,"I love these, they are comfortable and squat proof.  The material isn't thin and the seams are strong. I like the fabric and it's perfect for everything from the gym to running errands on the weekend."
5.0,"Fun socks! This is a nice mix of very festive and bright socks! They are nylon so there is not going to be much breathability with these, but that really is something you come to expect in this type of sock. They seem to have a good amount of stretch to them, so I imagine they will fit a variety of feet without a problem.  Overall, a fun sock for the holidays! Or a nice gag gift."
5.0,Nice thickness and cool colors.
5.0,Nice shirts. Would buy again.
5.0,Total hit at a 40 Birthday Celebration!!
5.0,fits amazing and comfortable
5.0,"This is the second cowboy hat I’ve gotten, the other one was pink. This brown one is slightly smaller but works great for dress up with my kids. Plus it’s a really nice soft material."
5.0,"My feet is wide and often I can not fit to American company's shoes, and I have to buy bigger size, but I don't need to buy bigger size for Itarian Shoemaker."
5.0,"These are really cute.  The shine is brilliant, and they are a cute size for a teen/tween.  They come in a box good for gifting."

5.0,"Love this shirt! Great fit, great quality!"
5.0,Perfect fit! Great polarized lenses! Fit perfectly!
5.0,"I love avaitors. I also am a self-proclaimed klutz. If I don't break my glasses, I lose them. Three glasses in a pack helps keep me from being shadeless (one pair for the car, one in my purse, and one in case something happens to one of the first two pair), and they look great! I've been wearing them for a month and haven't scratched them. I will buy these again for sure."
5.0,I got this jersey for my husband and he LOVES it. It is his favorite jersey and he only pulls it out for special games. It fits great and washes well.
5.0,"Mi bought this for my husband, he is 5ft 5 inches and and he is 130lbs. Small fits him perfectly, my first purchase I bought him medium and it was way too big for him. He likes this because it is not itchy and material is not like throws.Not too thick not too thin ,and there is a room for air to come in to your body. Perfect for doing your daily workout or to use as pjs at his me. Please not that I got this for free for an unbiased review."
5.0,"These are perfect for my Santa outfit.  I'm 6', 250 lbs, and the Mediums fit perfectly...nice big round lenses that are very clear...I've been a little rough with them playing Santa and they haven't scratched up yet so they are holding up nicely for the price."
5.0,Perfectly soft and comfortable! It goes with everything and looks great with a belt. Definitely buying more in the future
5.0,Very soft and comfortable and true to size!!
5.0,This is so comfortable! The product was true to size and the vibrant green is just what I was looking for. I'm so excited to wear this out!

5.0,Looks great and the fabric holds up to washes.
5.0,"Way sturdier than I expected.  Holds my longer wallet, phone (iPhone 12 pro max) , and a couple of other things.  I’m now on the highway t for some patches to add.  This will work perfectly for me"
5.0,GOOD DESIGN
5.0,The shirt looks beautiful 😍😍😍😍
5.0,"Beautiful,classy and stylish, this watch came well packaged in a box and I have had it for 5 weeks now,so far it hasn't scratched or faded so I know it will last me a good time once I don't get it wet or spray excessive perfume on it."
5.0,"LOVE this hat & shield. My kids can breathe, not scream or throw a fit over having to have their faces covered. Literally a sanity saver. And everywhere we go we get compliments and people who want to know where to get these."
5.0,"Light weight, pretty, keeps good time, good good materials, bright light."
5.0,I've been using it as a wrist strap for my clutch every day for over a month and it still has all it's rhinestones.
5.0,Great cloth! Large and multiple sides to both clean and polish.  Liked it so much I bought another one!
5.0,Great for the price. Skip the expensive ones on gypsy warrior and buy this instead.
5.0,"Fit perfect,  looks and feels great on, packs light. Not waiting to get another."
5.0,I dont think anyone will be disappointed. The color pops and can go with anything.
5.0,"Edit 2/11/20:<br />Customer service is excellent and rectified the quality issue. After using this for a week it had bumped my slim clip to the drawer.<br /><br />Coming from a slim clip I’ve been using since 2012 it’s hard to find a wallet that replicates that, but holds more cards and while I’m skeptical whether a band wallet will hold up this one seems great but only time will tell. I docked one star due to the carbon fiber plate being scratched before it was taken from the package. Speaking about the packaging, it’s presented beautifully and has everything you need! Hopefully this will be my new wallet for the next 10 years!"
5.0,JUST WHAT I WANTED
5.0,"Bought new Air Force 1’s so thought I’d get this product for preventative maintenance. I use this once a week and my shoes are still like new. I really recommend using this product regularly. I like that the soap works on any color shoe. If you are using these on white shoes with white laces, I don’t recommend trying to clean your laces. They won’t get back to that brand new look. Besides, laces are pretty cheap so I bought a few backups and replace them as needed to keep my shoes looking fresh."
5.0,Adorable. Comfortable

5.0,I went as Jessica rabbit for Halloween and this wig and accessories were  beyond perfect!
5.0,"Great stretch!  Good buy!<br />Love these! The fabric is phenomenal. Super stretchy, but still with great support. I wasn’t sure of size & just took chance on the M. But little tight in the waist (gut), & they were super short (not a huge issue). I think I’d prefer a L. I don’t expect them to be much longer. But they are not so short that they look unbecoming. I am going to try the L.  I lost nothing on my sizing error (Yes, it was my error-not the manufacturer nor Amazon). I just gave to my granddaughter. Great fit. She loves them!"
5.0,"I'm 5'1, 118pd 32DDD  and it fit great but loose around the stomach area"

5.0,Perfect for workout
5.0,"It’s study, well made and really cool! So yes it is a bit heavier than I was expecting, but the materials solid and I’ve had it for almost 2 years and the colors are still vibrant."
5.0,Can't wait for it to get here-every other item I have ordered from this company is great and made very well. Looks like I paid a lot more for it than what I actually paid!<br />Update: received wallet-love it! Well made and beautiful color!

5.0,"I ordered these pants on the recommendation of a runner friend.  They did not disappoint.  I have an iphone 11 and when I ran in these pants with my phone in the pocket, the pants didn't move at all.  I have had issues with constantly having to pull up other brands because of the weight of the phone.  As for sizing, I'm  5/8"" 150 and the medium is just right. I've already ordered a pair of shorts just like them, and I plan to order these in multiple colors. LOVE!"
5.0,He lived rhem
5.0,It fit my face better than other sun glasses Ive worn great dor wider face Nice looking also

5.0,"Love the color, got the orange, fit is great not too thin or clingy, got many compliments on this"
5.0,It fit very nicely.
5.0,"The color is great and so is the quality. They are super soft. However, these pants are best for winter and early spring as I think they would be too hot for late spring and early fall."
5.0,"Cuter than I thought it would be! Chain link came loose though, but easy to fix."
5.0,"I bought these leggings to wear after surgery to help with circulation. They are comfortable, soft, and do not ride down.  They definitely helped in my healing process and improved circulation while I was recovering."
5.0,"It didnt fit all my chickens but it fit my Buff Orpingtons great. We have some ruff roosters. This keeps my girls from loosing feathers. I have lost one though but i expected that kind of, since my chickens free range."
5.0,My hubby loves them. AND they're all different colors. In the picture some of them look the same and they aren't. Great buy
5.0,"Previous band broke on my scrub watch, so ordered this as a replacement. Arrived quickly & installed easily. Most pleased."
5.0,Being tall it's hard to find tank tops or shirts that are long enough.  These actually fit pretty well and i'm pleased to say I can lift my arms without them coming half way up my belly
5.0,"I just got these. I had been wearing Vanquisher 2.0 (which were fine). Sometimes I had leaks or really had to press down hard to get a seal, which caused some pressure; other times, the nose bridge dug into my nose. So fine goggles but not perfect.<br /><br />I was skeptical of the Magic5 when I got them because the instructions say where loose and do not press to seal.  I tried them and couldn't be more happy.  They stayed on, were super comfortable, didn't dig into my nose, no leaks, could handle turns.  Just a great product."
5.0,"Great fit, didn’t need to be adjusted and they work great"
5.0,"My husband loves it, fits him perfectly. The hat doesn’t ride down on his ears like most fishing hats."
5.0,Love. These are my go to leggings I wont buy anything else now. They are great quality material and really are squat proof. True to size.

5.0,"I purchased these for my brother and sister-in-law as a little wedding gift. My concern was if they would arrive in time, as it was a fairly last minute purchase. The seller was extremely helpful and communicative. The key chains themselves are plain, but that's fine. The metal is not flimsy as other reviews may suggest; the metal is aluminum though, so it *is* very lightweight. Love them, and so did the bride and groom."
5.0,Love that this top has stretch to it. The fit was perfect
5.0,Feel comfy. Love them!
5.0,I purchased this bracelet for my husband.  He loves it.  Not bulky-looking.

5.0,"Super soft, and great for outdoor yoga in the cooler weather."
5.0,Perfect.  Really tied my outfit together!
5.0,"Fabric isn't as soft as I thought it would be. Overall a good purchase. I'm allergic to certain metals and the original silicone band isn't that comfortable. But this band is light weight, fully adjustable and breathable. I will definitely purchase more in the future"
5.0,Nice pullover.  Lightweight and comfortable.
5.0,"Bought this for my husband and got a small because there were no mediums. He is 6 foot and 155lbs. The small was snug and would have been better in a medium.

5.0,"Looks lovely. Even tho it's not expensive, I get complimented on it all the time. People are always inquiring about it. In my opinion it doesn't really look cheap. I did take it off it's plastic rope and put it on a silver chain."

5.0,These watch bands are easy to put on and adjust! I have very sensitive skin and the plastic bands irritate my skin especially when damp from hand washing or sweat.  These bands dry quickly and can also be easily adjusted to dry underneath them.  The bands also look great and are very durable!
5.0,"Great buy! I really like the pattern on the sleeve. Fits well too. True to size, which is a BIG win when shopping clothes online."
5.0,Comodo para la computadora y pantalla portátil entre otros
5.0,this dress is awesome. better than expected.. good material. nice fit.. i got Xlarge.. i am 5'5 174lbs.. and it fit great. even room to spare.. so the xl is plenty big n true to size. i couldve got large but didnt take the chance bc im making this into a mermaid costume.only thing is there is no tag or sewn seams so that is kinda cheap. but serves it purpose n i might even buy another one in a diff color.. shipping time was decent. about 4 days reg air mail
5.0,"I bought this purse in green a couple of years ago because it was a small purse that matched my style. Here I am again buying it in tan just to switch things up a bit. I love the layout, makes some things easier to access and has nooks and crannies for things you don't use as often."
5.0,Perfect gift for cast members of Calendar Girls. They loved it!
5.0,"she started walking good by 10 months but hated shoes, they all seem to weight her feet down and cause her to fall a lot, these are light weight and she loves them"

5.0,Beautiful freshwater pearls. Much nicer than I expected. I’m very pleased.
5.0,"I'm very happy with this toe ring! It was bigger than most toe rings I've bought in the past, so I had to adjust it so that the ends overlap side by side. It really doesn't take away from the product for me though. I've worn it non stop for the past month now, and its held up great. Stamped sterling and everything. Very beautiful!"
5.0,"Beautiful fit, and very well made!<br />Colors true to photo.<br />Very pleased"

5.0,"I'm always leary of buying things can't see in front of me (pictures lie lol) I was presently surprised, made well, the beads are large enough for me to handle (have fine motor skills issues)<br />My only ""Con"" is that I thought it was 10 decades, not 5."
5.0,"It fit my dad as expected. The waist of the pant is flexible to stretch, even I strentch with force. The material is comfortable and cozy. It can withstand wash without leaking color to water. My dad 's waist is about 35&#34;. The size M fit just right."
5.0,Nice lightweight sweatshirt. Soft enough if you don't want to wear a shirt underneath and light enough to not be too hot.
5.0,I was very satisfied with the ring. I used it to go with my roaring 20’s red sequins and feather headband. It was the perfect color of red.

5.0,This is the most comfortable gown that I have worn in a very long time. I am going to get all the colors so I will have enough to last a long time.
5.0,"I needed a nice warm winter cap. I found this one and decided to order one.  It is well made with thick cable stitching.  The interior of this cap is lined with luxurious fleece and it also, in addition to warmth, makes the hat very comfortable to wear.  The hat is generously made so if you have a larger head size or wish to pull it over the ears it is easily done.  The hat is very cute on and it has a nice size pom pom on it. My only regret was I did not order two of them.  It really is a very nicely made cap for the price. I am very pleased with this purchase."

5.0,"Great product, fast service"
5.0,This is an inexpensive piece of jewerly but it doesn't look cheap at all.
5.0,This is a great soft flexible mask frame that does what it’s supposed do—helps me breathe and preserves my chapstick application while working masked 10-11 hour shifts full-time at your favorite online retailer’s warehouse in North Las Vegas!!! ;).  This product definitely fulfills a needed niche and I’m glad it’s been offered for sale!  Great seller too—item arrived fast!  Very satisfied with my purchase.  — Heather

5.0,Jacket fit just right. I bought a men's small for my petite granddaughter and it fit her perfectly. Arm length was nice and long. Very pleased
5.0,"I knew this top was going to be huge, it's meant to fit large, so if you like tighter fitting clothes, this may not be the top for you. It's perfect to throw on over a pair of leggings or jeans. I love the fit of this top. The seam hits just at the waist so it lays really nice on your body."
5.0,"Was glad to find a pair of compression socks for working 12 hour shifts that were not BLACK, NUDE or WHITE.  Got lots of compliments the first day I wore them and my legs felt great.

5.0,extremely comfortable basic but cute
5.0,My husband raves about these — he doesn’t feel the cold at all when he’s ice fishing! Great bibs and the matching jacket was worth it!
5.0,Arrived on time. Color a little darker than picture but I like it better.

(My hand is ok folks, had some henna art done and bandaged earlier that day). I'll get a few more wears out of it and see how it holds up!"
5.0,Love it.<br />Size XL
5.0,"I love this dress. I'm 5 11 and 175 pounds. I ordered an XL in dark blue. I will be wearing tights or leggings because I'm pale. Fits like it should. No weird odor like a few others have said. I did order a tan belt and tan heels to go with it. Overall satisfied and excited to go out on the town. :) the belt that's provided is cheap and I wanted a more defined waist, so I ordered one separate."
5.0,"So, we're all leary of new shoes, but I gotta say, this is the first time EVER that I've had a new pair of shoes treat me so well. No rubbing, not too tight, just fits perfect."
5.0,"These are very comfortable socks and I love the little pop of color when they peek out of my sneakers. They look really cute and are great for jogging, they don't slip down or anything and I can go on long runs without my heel getting tore up by the sock/shoe rub so that's a huge plus. I really love these!"
5.0,Came on time with correct amount and fit perfectly
5.0,"The sizing is weird, but it fit even though I know I'm not a 2x."
5.0,My second grade students decorated a bag for our student teacher. It was perfect!

5.0,Fits well in the pocket. Not too bulky.
5.0,"Nicer than I thought.  Solid,  pretty and nice size.  Not too big or too small.  Fits great."
5.0,"The only reason I say the fit is a little on the big side is because I got a 2X, when I should have gotten the XL. That being said, I was expecting a regular hoodie, but this one is much heavier, and I'm not going to complain about that one bit. In fact, the extra room will allow me to wear another sweater or a jacket underneath it (if I really have to)."
5.0,Súper buena calidad y las piedras son un amor
5.0,It's very large (the fit) and I have a very large head!

5.0,"It's a tad tight, but worn with tunic style shirt it's perfect for work."
5.0,"Some of the same size dresses are not made the same. I do love the caftans they feel good on, make these for Fall and winter, I have bought so many in the past weeks. I really love these Verdusa caftans they are flowing when you walk, doesn't cling and very comfortable, in recent weeks since discovering these Caftans I have bought all of them including the shorter sleeves caftans I have a total of about 18 or more, that's how much I love these Caftans, make the white and cream, and ivory colors in Long sleeve please. Good job Amazon."
5.0,Brightens cloudy days and makes it possible to drive comfortably at night even in the rain.

5.0,"Perfect. I think it's a work out top but I wear it as a regular shirt. The back is so cute. Actually fits like the photo. I'm 5'2 and 128 lbs, got the large. Medium would have worked too but I like the slouchy look."

5.0,This swimsuit is incredibly flattering and I absolutely love the retro vibe! I followed the size chart to my measurements and the suit fits perfectly.
5.0,"I originally bought it for travel, but i just love it now. I would normally use a wristlet- but I’m nuch happier with this! Great small size but big enough for cards + phone and keys depending on the size. And I don’t have to worry about leaving it in a restaurant or bar/ it’s always on my person! Nice, small not bulky!!"
5.0,Amazing quality. I love the roll tab sleeves as I don't like to show my arms. Super comfy. Great packaging. Buying all colors!! Great shirt for any occasion. I get great compliments on it. Love!!
5.0,I love these bottoms. This is my 3rd pair. I'm an aqua aerobics instructor so I'm in a pool almost daily. But I also wear them to the recrearional pool and the beach because they look great with any tankini top. These last me about a year. They keep my muffin top contained and stay put when I move around alot. Great suit.
5.0,Purse is cute. Lots of room. I think it can be used all year around based on the colors. If you love Marlyn you will love this bag. :-)
5.0,"Loved this set! Very elegant and classy, and great quality! I wore it to a black tie event and got many compliments."
5.0,This is a very beautifil and stylish. I enjoy wearing mine

5.0,My wife will use it when we are able to travel again.
5.0,It was a good fit (next larger size than I would've normally ordered). The recipient LOVED it!
5.0,I had to buy two they are so pretty! I like the little brass bell it is soft soothing sound and dainty. My daughter and I both love this bracelet...matches perfectly with her carnelian ring!

5.0,Very cute! Can't wait to put them on my newborn. Arrived much quicker than I was expecting!
5.0,"Very cute and flowy.<br />I'm a size 10-12 and the large was just right.<br />I plan on purchasing another in a different color.<br />It was a little low cut for me, so I wore a thin shirt underneath."
5.0,My granddaughter wanted this to give it to her aunt.  It's very pretty<br /> I'm sure aunt will love it too
5.0,"I’m so in love with these, can’t wait to wear them"

5.0,I am Iron Man.
5.0,"Comfortable to wear, very impressive design for my 3 year old. Size runs a bit big, but shoes are perfect, very happy with them."
5.0,"Love these. Especially for places with not alot of storage, like crusie ship cabins. Can easily keep underwear in one, socks in another, bras in one, swim suits in one. A different color for each family member. Dont have clothes all over the place."
5.0,New Color on my head is looking good.
5.0,I love this band for my Fitbit! It has held up extremely well. I wear the Fitbit portion on the inside of my wrist and it looks like I’m wearing a stack of beaded bracelets.
5.0,I liked that it came with a separate hood and the length on the body is lengthy.
5.0,Terrific 1/2” size post in center of earring! Looks fabulous on the ear!
5.0,"very nice, beautiful earring set. Bought them for my daughter and she loves them. They have rubber backs on them so I did start using old backs I had around because we lost one due to them coming off , so be careful they aren't loose!but still i bought A bunch more cause they're a great deal!"
5.0,"As expected from Suko, great jeans again! I will keep ordering."
5.0,"I've never owned one if these so I'm not actually sure if it fits as expected, but it fit me lol. Great fabric. A little stiff but in a good way. Well made and warm."
5.0,"Value for your money. Well priced, sturdy, good quality, love the pockets, tablet compartment. And has a strip on the handle for better support for carrying. We bought in total 3 pieces and is using it as a Go-bag. Undeniably a better quality than other Go bag backpack being sold. Downside- a little heavy though. But that is because of the material used. Thick and sturdy. Still prefer this to other brand that can break or tear open."
5.0,Just beautiful color. So many compliments
5.0,I like the material and style
5.0,"I bought this for my husband. It fit as expected, is super soft and the material is high quality. Love it so far!"
5.0,I bought this for a gift. She loves and has worn it every day. I would definitely buy it again for myself or as another gift
5.0,I love this pin and wear it with anything. The plastic crystals seem well in place and the clasp is plenty strong
5.0,i did buy a size up and it fits a little snug!  but i absolutely love it and i was a little nervous buying a swimsuit online bc i always have the worst luck but i love this one!
5.0,🙏THANK U SO MUCH🤗 & 😊HAPPY 🌈BLESSED 🌟HOLIDAYS 2 ALL OF U!😇
5.0,Love the pattern and easy fit.
5.0,"This is a gorgeous dress! Very flattering. You can go from day to night easily with this dress. Perfect for all occasions. Great seller, too!"
5.0,"Extremely happy with this. Was the star wars jacket I wanted. Is a little lose but I don't think I could have gotten a size smaller realistically. Make sure to take that tag on the neck line off, its annoying."
5.0,The earrings are pretty. They came in secure packaging and faster than expected. The tracking told me I may get it early November and it came today (October 20). Good buy!
5.0,They fit perfectly in my Style Switch sunglasses. The clarity and UV protection is excellent. You can forget you are wearing them indoors.
5.0,"Fit my hubby perfect! He's 6'5, 238lbs, and they fit perfect in length and width. Great for fit and tall men."
5.0,i got these for my bridesmaids. my matron of honor had clear and the other girls had red. they looked good. ther werent so huge that it took away from the whole look. just big enough for a little something. the matching earings were nice aswell. i have had my girls come back to me after the wedding and say haw they love wearing the set out and about. yay
5.0,Very nice earrings. Fast delivery. Highly recommend.
5.0,I bought these under shirts for my husband who has a very long torso and the XL Tall fit him perfectly! They are made of high quality cotton without side seams. They are long enough to fit comfortably tucked in his pants. They shrank only a tiny bit in a hot wash cycle which is to be expected of 100% cotton. Will definitely buy these again!
5.0,Gift for wife... loves them
5.0,Perfect fit for a 4 year old. Arrived on time. I recommend
5.0,This costume fit my 3 year old perfectly! It took a little less than 2 weeks to arrive in the mail. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,Bought it for my toddler. The scarf is very soft and big enough to cover the whole neck. Just what I wanted.
5.0,"I got this as a COVID covering, but this thing covers way more than needed for that. Specifically, this is a whole balaclava, not just a neck gaiter. As such, this covering didn't see much use over the spring, summer, and fall.<br /><br />As for its function as a balaclava, it's fine. It isn't thick, but the thick ones are for when you aren't moving around in freezing temperatures. This one would be fine for not-quite freezing temperatures or for being active in the cold. Especially in the snow when that reflected light zaps your skin into an angry red hue."
5.0,I'm a 'Trekkie'. This keychain is so cool. Having the Star Trek logo along with the most famous line from the original series adds class to your keychain. I show it off. I'm very pleased.
5.0,"I bought this Crankshaft sensor and a Cam sensor and so far so good. I pray I wont have any problems later on. I have a 2001 buick park avenue. I ordered Saturday and received my order Monday morning, super fast delivery.."
5.0,"My sister recommended these to me. I have trouble driving on wet nights, the glare off the roads is just too much for me! These clip-on's really cut down on the glare and make it much easier to drive. Since they came 2 paors to an order, I shared with a friend. Now she can see too!"
5.0,These are super cute and just like the picture. They are adjustable and comfortable. Slightly bulky with the crystals on there but that’s to be expected. Love the different colors and you get a good variety for the price.
5.0,Very Nice!!
5.0,Supports my friends after Maria
5.0,"The bracelet is really cool and I love to wear it. The styling is truly great, as is the color."
5.0,Bracelet is BEAUTIFUL! But if u have big wrists it may be slightly uncomfortable because even those it’s stretchy it is small.
5.0,Í love ir so much
5.0,Will back nicely and has a nice look to it.. very comfortable..
5.0,Purse is lovely. Looks just like the photos. Sturdy and it’s the perfect size.
5.0,Absolutely adorable!! Just like it’s pictured.
5.0,"These socks are a little bit of heaven. Super soft and warm. Nice price, Fast ship."
5.0,This cribbage board is just gorgeous! I received it in such a short time after ordering. It is a gift for my son-in-law for christmas & he is going to be so pleased! Really fine craftmanship!
5.0,I got the smaller ones. My daughter loved it.
5.0,"The mask fit pretty comfortably. But also I noticed the way it was shipped made the nose portion fold up awkwardly, nothing a few socks and hanging up for a day couldn’t fix though. The plastic over the eye was starting to fog up due to my breathing, maybe an extra vent would’ve helped but the small vent holes in the mask did not do much. Overall happy with the purchase!"
5.0,"I purchased these for my daughter and she seemed to like them very much. Reports were that they fit well and washed nicely. Also, kept her feet warm on cold winter nights. That sounds like a plus  to me!"
5.0,"rugged! No leaks, solid shoes. I Don't wear mine hiking or backpacking, mostly commuting in Ohio snow so not too much wear and tear. I'm happy!"
5.0,Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or poke me! Very comfy and practical for everyday use
5.0,Fantastic gift for my daughter.  She is a fan of Spiderman.
5.0,"I've been losing weight, a good thing, and had trouble figuring out what size belt went with a 34 waist.  For the most part the answer was not a size 34 belt.  Tried three and most were not even close.  Then I read that this would fit a size 33-37 waist.  It works!!!  And I really like the appearance with blue jeans and khaki chinos.  Perfect."
5.0,"This is the first time I've used these, I ordered them per a recommendation from my sisters because I had aches in my legs.  I have large calves so I've never been able to wear normal long socks, so I like that these were available for larger calves.  They were easy to go on and I can definitely feel a difference when I am standing and sitting down.  Will order a couple more pairs."
5.0,Used for little gifts for family Christmas!  Perfect
5.0,The sunglasses are great! The polorization works well and I think they look very stylish. They are a little larger than I was expecting but they are advertised as &#34;oversized&#34; so I should have been prepared. Overall I think they are a good buy for the price.
5.0,Love this! So soft and beautiful!! Truly! I wish they had more like em!!!
5.0,This is the best set of charms we have gotten. Super cute with a huge selection.
5.0,Cool hat. We'll made!
5.0,So soft. Love this cardigan.
5.0,"Quality headgear.  Bought it to protect from winter winds.  Keeps wind out, head protected, and ears warm.  Fits nicely!"
5.0,Like how fit
5.0,Fits perfectly looks elegant. Love it....
5.0,Cute design. Fit as expected.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!
5.0,Came to me in an adorable gift box with a thank you note and tiny vixx pics as a order gift. The chains they come on have an adjustable chain clasp. I love my rings. I got the Leo and the VIXX. they look as the do in the photo and seem very durable as advertised. I have a size 7 finger and they fit perfect if I choose to wear them
5.0,Great wallet for carrying little cash.
5.0,It was so easy to adjust and fits perfectly.  I love the look - makes the watch look a little classier when going someplace special.  I have a very small wrist and most bands which are adjustable still don’t get small enough or they are impossible to adjust (practically need jeweler tools and a high powered magnifying glass) - this band isn’t that way.  I highly recommend it.  I haven’t worn it long enough to gauge the durability but it appears to be strong and will last a long time.  I change my bands regularly and don’t wear the same ones every day.
5.0,Jeep key chain in my favorite color. I love it!
5.0,"Good shoes so far! I’m a forefoot runner and had some arch and heel pain. I needed something that I could run in without discomfort and fear of injury. I got these recommended to me at a running shoe store after they analyzed my gait (well, actually I was recommended an older style that I can no longer get in my size: the 360 Sensation 3, but these seem a good replacement for those). I’ll update if there are any issues, but there don’t seem to be so far."
5.0,Super comfortable and slips right on!
5.0,"Loved colors, fit & design"
5.0,I LOVE this robe!  They are not all equal and this one is fabulous!
5.0,I ordered the biggest as you could get based on some of the other reviews I'm kind of happy I did not saying it would have been too small but I actually prefer it really big I'm only 5 foot but I'm also blessed top but a 3X fits me as either an awesome shirt with a great pair of pants or I could even wear it as a dress and that looks absolutely amazing makes me feel really pretty I do suggest not doing anything around pokey stuff as it's kind of like a silk Bill and it will run I snagged mine but that was my fault it definitely wasn't because of the quality I really like it
5.0,Fits perfectly! Just enough coverage for the right places. Would absolutely recommend.
5.0,"Took FOREVER to get to my house, but was totally worth the wait. The dice and chain are made of strong, metal material and I’m will last me a long time."
5.0,I LOVE THIS VEST!
5.0,Very nice product. Fits well and is comfortable.
5.0,"I wish there was an extra small. The small is a bit too big for me. I am 4'10&#34; and I weigh 113 pounds. Other than that, I love it. The fabric is nice and it feels cozy enough to wear. The colors are very nice too."
5.0,Like this purse a lot.

5.0,"These shoes are very comfortable, stylish, and well made. I absolutely love them!"
5.0,It's adorable on me!
5.0,"Bought as a watch to wear while working in the yard, but it's nicer than that. 36 mm case is traditional men's size, not like current large military watches., so it works well for smaller wrist. NATO strap alone is worth the price of this watch."
5.0,They work good😁
5.0,Can wear it with anything
5.0,Beautiful necklace. Exactly like the picture and seems like excellent quality.
5.0,Wore these to a wedding and I danced the night away without a blister or having to take<br />My shoes off because of rubbing! Also got a lot of compliments!

5.0,"El producto es de excelente calidad, ligero, cómodo y además luce muy bien, estoy muy satisfecho con el producto. Recomendado."
5.0,Tried on tarnished necklace today. Worked like a charm!
5.0,These earrings are absolutely gorgeous.
5.0,I really like the colors and patterns.  They are very soft and comfy.  Band at the top is just right.  All in all a good buy.
5.0,I liked the size and length of the earrings but I would have liked the hummingbirds to be a little larger.  The birds were very hard to see.
5.0,I love it!! It sways with my every movement while walking and doing housework.
5.0,"I love it. I've actually received several positive comments about it. People are shocked that it was such a great price. I can only wear real sterling or the color fades, so I know this is great quality."
5.0,"Besides the title summing up my general feeling about my keychain, this keychain is rather big. I received the cat-uppcino one and it was bigger than I anticipated. You can see all the details and it is easy to attach to keys or bags. I especially like the variety of options you can get."
5.0,Great loose flowy dress for the upcoming warm weather. Also stretchy. Fits great!
5.0,Love the color!  Needed an orange top for a friends themed 50th birthday celebration.

I don't have pierced ears, and the clip on earrings were never comfortable. these are great with the padding!  the padding is attatached to the back of the earrings. they say they are for kids but I am an adult and they look and feel wonderful!"
5.0,This is a must have for my shoe repair arsenal!! Looks dark at first but dries so natural:)) And super easy to use!
5.0,My daughter loves it....Was a ggreat birthday gift for her! Thank you!
5.0,Love this!  Very soft and flattering.
5.0,Great product my daughter loves this.
5.0,"Due to the content of the fabric + the thickness of the fabric, the workmanship and the generous size, this top is a high-quality product and is worth the money in the market today, which is perfect for me. I like oversized sweatshirts and hoodies. I want it to be 100% cotton, or at least 77% cotton, but I cannot find the fiber content and percentage on the website, nor can I find the label inside the clothes. It feels at least 77% cotton. The only design I want to change is to make a drop sleeve to make the shoulders look wider, and the raglan sleeve to make the shoulders look narrower."
5.0,"The item was worth the money. It fit well, comfortable and loved the color. Liked it a lot that I bought a few more. :)"
5.0,"I'm a 5'5&#34;, 165 lbs Hispanic woman and boy do these fit great. I have kind of a big ass, and the mediums fit perfectly. They're super comfortable and I love the colors. They look really big for a medium so just be aware I suppose."
5.0,"I like it.  It doesn't make my anxiety completely disappear but it helps to relax me a bit.  I don't really like to wear accessories but I've been wearing this for about a week because I find it to be useful.  It's well made in my opinion.  I haven't had any issues with the quality.  I'm not sure I would ever wear it out in public, however.  I only wear it and use it when I'm at home.  I'm a very anxious person so to me it's a nice little tool to have to remind me to just relax and breathe."
5.0,Love them. They are very pretty and my daughter loves them
5.0,love these! ordering  2 more pair!
5.0,"Beautiful leather, beautiful bag and great customer service."
5.0,"Love it.<br />Super soft and cute.<br />I am a 5'7"" and usually size small on top. I ordered a small and it fits great."

5.0,MY HUSBAND IS HAPPY WITH HIS PURCHASE. HE LIKES THIS BRAND.

5.0,like this Trapeze Dress most. it very pretty and flattering and the color is mostly the bright and attractive where the better quality. thanks and would like to purchase.
5.0,Nice fit on my 71/4-71/2 head. Works well enough for jogging. My wife thinks she could also wear them but we haven't tried that yet.<br />Good clarity in lenses. Not really dark (sorta medium grey) but good for me. Durability TBD.  So far I like them and think good value ....
5.0,is really nice i like it
5.0,Love. Fits great.  Fells great
5.0,I love them! Super cute! Arrived on time.
5.0,Easy on and off. They really dispell the sun and provide a cooler feeling than riding bare armed. Really felt nice and comfortable.
5.0,I got 2 pairs for my boys last spring and they wore them playing all summer and they still look good and comfortable. My oldest tends to stomp on the back end and had messed up shoes like that but These seems unaffected..
5.0,Such a great price and well made blots of thick hair!! Great colors! My daycare kids will love it! The grinch is coming for Christmas next year!!!

5.0,"These are really expensive looking socks for a low cost.  Very comfy, they keep you warm without sweating.  I wear a size 8 shoe and these are perfect.  The crew height is fine because they don't slip down.  Highly recommended."

5.0,I love this dress. It fits really nicely. I would buy it again.
5.0,"Reached out to the company and they don't make a bigger one that you can order in a single.  This is great, easy to access keys.  I just would like it a bit larger.  But good quality and I would buy another one!"
5.0,"Magical, great for kids"
5.0,Loved it!! I was a little disappointed because the seem of the skirt opened the first time using it

5.0,"I ordered these for a themed party and expected them to be one night stand type glasses, instead they have held up and are still in excellent condition after multiple other uses. Would definitely purchase again."
5.0,"This was a gift for my mom,  she really liked it and was happy with the size, weigh and quality of the bracelet!"
5.0,"I got these last summer for vacation and ordered new (larger) pairs for my kids for this year.  They actually wear them all the time.  They are cute, non skid, and comfy.  Great for the mucky lake or the slippery splash pad.  I definitely recommend these.  They are by far the best water shoes we've had."
5.0,I love the fit of this dress and was surprised by the quality because of the price.
5.0,"I use these for nighttime eczema moisturizing. They work great, extremely soft and light. I am a female and wear size M latex gloves (I'm an RN) and these fit great."
5.0,"Muy bonita, Excelente diseño queda Elegante al cuerpo, me encanto =)"
5.0,"Exactly as advertised. Attractive, well-made, plenty of room."
5.0,I really love this bangle. I got it in a couple colors for my bridesmaids to wear. It's elegant with the right amount of sparkle without being flashy.
5.0,These look great when you need a little dazzle with that outfit.
5.0,I got these for my bridesmaids during my wedding. They are very pretty and my bridesmaids were  very really happy to get them. They still wear them all the time.
5.0,"I am a HUGE fan of Vera Bradley bags. I own about 7 Vera bags and this is my favorite. I am in love with the Island Bloom print; it's bright, cheery and very roomy (without being huge) It has one pocket on the outside in the front (just right for your phone) Inside it has several pockets on the front wall and a zipper pocket on the back wall. The inside has a geometric square print and it has an oval bottom. It is a really nice bag, the fabric is a very nice soft durable cotton. This bag is well worth every penny. A must have for all Vera Bradley lovers."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful charm!  Looks perfect on my Pandora bracelet.  So reasonable considering the workmanship and materials.
5.0,I was looking for the ideal shape and size for my new crossbody purse and I have it in this one!  The shape of a saddle is perfect to fit my wallet and other things I carry in my purse without being to big or tight of space.  I use as my daily purse and even traveled out of town with it with no complaints.  It is offered in many colors and is a bargain the quality  .
5.0,Great during comic con. Nice addition to my badge
5.0,fit great very comfortable
5.0,Super sexy!
5.0,The tie is great for the price point.  Bright and decently made.  A little thin but that seems to be normal for ties in this price range.  Loved it and would order it in another color if a situation required it.
5.0,"Nice hat, bought for an Asian women I see all the time walking at the park. She never has a hat on and in Arizona summers, you need a hat. So, next time I see her. I will give it to her."
5.0,Fantastic belt. I'm a plumbing technician and even though I'm only 165lbs. I put a lot of tools in my pockets and it weighs down my pants. This belt helps not only keep them up but when I get bloated from a large lunch on the go. I can quickly lessen the strap to give relief. A+
5.0,Made very well with good quality buckle.
5.0,We buy for church auxillary and members it covers all and serves purpose  for uniforms for all shapes and we add our logo to it

5.0,Beautiful dress and fits very well.I'm pleased with my purchase.
5.0,"These are sooo small and I absolutely love them! Perfect for adding subtle shine. They may be too small for some people but for someone that loves super small jewelry, these are great."
5.0,"I'm 6'4"" with a fit-muscular build and I was surprised that the medium fit me so perfectly. Nice, comfortable tri-blend fabric, feels good on the skin."
5.0,Not only was the watch great but the box was a great surprise.  He love it.
5.0,It works great and does not take much to do my shoes. It less you keep you leather shoe like leather and has a great shine. I am a believer. It also goes a long way.
5.0,I wore this dress to my brothers graduation and it was perfect! Very comfortable and fits as expected. The pockets were a great bonus!
5.0,Fits great. Just a little slim. Guess thats the skinny.

5.0,So cute and we're awesome for our honeymoon:)
5.0,The kids love it
5.0,"Perfect fit. Slenderizing, Very cute on."
5.0,This dress is amazing!! It’s very comfortable and the sleeve length was perfect for chillier weather. The dress is very good quality and exceeded my expectations.
5.0,Very pretty love the variety
5.0,"The bag quality was superb but after 6 months of daily use, the leather started peeling off and the stiffness and shape of the bag started to become more flexible and misshapen"
5.0,Fits perfect - not annoying material . Soft . Not annoying when walking.
5.0,This was a great buy. Material was awesome and the dress is very unique.
5.0,"Look great, I haven't worn yet, bought for a cruise gong in a couple weeks."

5.0,Product is great and was shipped right on time!
5.0,Fit just as expected. Good quality and seem to be holding up very well.
5.0,A bit big on my 8yr old but i like it bc the image is actually the shirt so you wouldnt have to worry about the image peeling
5.0,"It's a very nice wallet, package came on time, And my boyfriend loves it 🤗🤗"
5.0,great gift. my friend was very pleased
5.0,item exactly as described!
5.0,"Sizes do run a little large.  Typically I do XXL (my spring/winter is an alpinestars) but this fit me fine with XL.  I like that there are arm straps and waist straps.  Armor seems fine, feels different from the D30 back panel I have in my other jacket.  Honestly the quality of this stomps all over the similarly priced icon jackets I was trying on at a shop.  To me those clearly had compromises in features and quality, I don't feel that way about this jacket."
5.0,Kinda a tight fit if you're a big guy. Otherwise perfect.
5.0,"Good product, fairly easy to install and adjust. Had to send first one back as I did not understand the sizing the first time around. Once I had the right one it was great."
5.0,Very nice men tie.
5.0,"Nice and light-weight, exactly what I was looking for."
5.0,Very pretty dress. Just like the picture! Fits perfectly and hugs all the right places. I’m 4”11 weighs 130lbs and I got a L. Wish it was a little shorter but I’ll make it work. Hope this review helps
5.0,Love my mask and I can breathe through it unlike some others I have ordered. I wish it came with a filter pocket but I’ll fix that myself. I wore it for Labor Day weekend and many people liked it and asked where I purchased it.
5.0,"Fast delivery, very nice quality, a bit deformed due to packaging but was easily corrected, would buy again from seller"
5.0,Got for a kids party instead of hats. Everyone got a kick out of them even the great grandparents .
5.0,Beautiful dress! My girls got so many compliments from this dress.
5.0,Great! Fits true to size.
5.0,My great grandson loves it. He wants to wear it everyday!
5.0,"This purse is beautiful. The pink is sharp and bright next to the black. The size is great....it really is exactly as pictured. Only small downfall is that since it's patent leather, as are the straps and that makes them slippery so the purse slips off my shoulders. Aside from that, I am in love. I have received a few compliments on it. One gal at work who is a name brand snob even asked me who makes it."
5.0,Soft fabric. A bit itchy though. But nice sweater.
5.0,"I ordered up because I always take shrinkage into consideration when I see cotton as the primary material in the fabric. Cotton is the most comfortable fabric for underwear, and these are 95% cotton with 5% spandex for elasticity. I didn’t need to go up a few sizes, as these showed no detectable shrinkage after very hot wash and dry. I pre wash all undergarments, as I don’t want to risk any dyes left over from manufacturing. After pre washing, wearing and washing again, these stayed true to size. Even though I could have easily ordered one, or two sizes smaller, there is enough elastic from the spandex that they still fit perfectly. If I reorder, I will try the smaller versions, but these are very comfortable, and a great product. Highly recommended!"
5.0,THESE PANTS ARE AWESOME IN FACT I AM ORDERING ANOTHER PAIR.
5.0,Had it since and love it I’m a very physical person doing a lot of active things is very breathable material sweat won’t build up underneath would definitely recommend this product to people and possibly buy more colors for myself!
5.0,Made a great gift for a great couple :-)
5.0,I really suggest this product! Sturdy and easy to see!
5.0,"Very soft and comfortable, love the fit"
5.0,Look just like the picture! Super cute!
5.0,"100 % cotton, will shrink.  I wear a large and bought an xtra large and the fit is perfect after first wash"
5.0,"Comfy, nice design and excellent price!"
5.0,This is the most beautiful sweater. Very true to size. The price is absolutely amazing for this high quality sweater! I wish it came in more colors!!! You will NOT be disappointed!
5.0,Looks great on her and she says it's one of the most comfortable she has ever worn.
5.0,Washes and wears well.
5.0,"I haven't given bandeaus a shot in years. I have a few off the shoulder shirts and so I decided I may as well try them out again. I'm glad I did! It fits well and doesn't feel too loose. The pads are super cupped though, which is kind of annoying, but they are removable."
5.0,Loved them. Both back and front screw off and they are super easy to put on. They are everything I expected.
5.0,Perfect replacement band
5.0,"the dress is so beautiful,fits as expected and it came on time, had so many compliments,highly recommended"
5.0,"This is my second Tula hat,  I purchased the first when I lived in Austin, TX where it gets as hot as a chili pepper in the summer!  These hats are very well made and last for ages.  I love that this one has a chin strap as the brim is quite large and is susceptible to blowing off on windy days.  I live in Florida now so sun protection is a must and my Tula hats are perfect for the beach, gardening and even golf.  I also love that they come in smaller sizes as I have a small head and hats that fit are hard to find."
5.0,Beautiful dress. Hangs nice and washes nice.
5.0,"Just the right size for this 72-year old lady!  When it came, there was some fraying-a little bottle of Fray-Chek used on all seams inside pockets, inside cavity, etc, then spray twice with weather-resistant product (I do this on every pair of shoes and every purse), air-drying (if possible) and running it through the dryer for a bit (a few minutes) will get it ready to use.  Strap allows for shoulder or cross-body carrying."
5.0,adjustable side loops provides good fit and masks wash nicely.
5.0,"The shirt is so soft, a little stretchy, and flattering. It covers the lower belly area which I have a hard time finding. I ordered several colors. The first time I wore one I saw a friend I haven't seen in over 6 months, and her first words were you look great you've lost weight. I had not lost any, in fact I have gained weight since last I saw her. That's when I knew I loved these shirts. I sized up because I like my shirts flowy."
5.0,I love the feel and the support they provide.
5.0,Muy muy lindo!!❤️ completamente satisfecha con mi compra y gracias !!! Porque trae la herramienta para ajustar así que el tamaño de la pulsera no es problema y trae una linda nota escrita a mano gracias por tomar el tiempo en hacerla<br />muy recomendado seguiré comprando más relojes de este vendedor
5.0,"I wear a 34 DD and got a medium. These are good for high impact workouts with jumping jacks, burpees, box jumps, etc. straps dig in a bit but not more than is expected for high impact work."
5.0,I bought it for my sister-in-law and it fits her perfect. The print is pretty and the jacket is soft and comfortable and warm.  It made a great christmas present.
5.0,true to the color and beautiful.

5.0,Nice gloves and the wife likes them.
5.0,granddaughter lives in tutus!  absolutely loves it!
5.0,Great purse
5.0,These glasses are great because they're polarized 2 let you see better and when you're driving you can see better in the rain. I would highly recommend them. And I like the fact that you can flip them up
5.0,gr8 product/service. future business w/ referrals 2 b expected
5.0,"Great dress bought it for a funeral. The fit is good with room to grow . Only issue I have is the sliver pin in the front . it came off so many times and with me pinning it each time , I got annoyed and took it off . But the quality of the dress is great."
5.0,I bought this so i can wear to my baby shower next month and i love the fit and material. I can’t wait to wear it
5.0,Great for female shirt cuffs.
5.0,"I loved the shorts, bought them for my son and he loved them.  Wish there was a greater variety in order to purchase more."
5.0,Super comfortable! I'm actually getting a second pair for a friend. Great product!!
5.0,I normally don't buy white dresses but this one fits soooo nice.  I like the draping around the hips.  The fabric is so cool against the skin.
5.0,The dress is great for the price. I bought it for a trip to Hawaii and I can’t wait to wear it. The op n back is sexy but it still provides enough support and coverage.
5.0,So many colors for such a good price!
5.0,Dope
5.0,I love the comfy fit.
5.0,"Great price for 4 pack of lanyards. Material is soft, colors are true to the photo. The rubber attachments were a little stiff to put on, but once on they seem very secure. I've only had them for a short time, so don't know how they will hold up, but we don't plan to take them on and off our sunglasses very often, so hopefully we can avoid the breakage issues mentioned in other reviews."
5.0,these were a gift for my daughter for her birthday. I love how they looked. You can see they are made well. My daughter just loved them!!
5.0,"Had a hard time finding Suncloud, but my favorite sunglass company.  They blow away by $160 Rayban Aviators with respect to optics and comfort."
5.0,"I have already gotten compliments from wearing this both at work and on the weekends. It's not the most expensive piece, but it's a great value. The asymmetrical turquoise beading is unique, as is the &#34;coin&#34; (even though it doesn't say anything Earth-shattering--just a year and a brand). The length is perfect to wear over almost any shirt, and it goes with most of my clothes (denim, navy, orange, black, white, etc.). You can't tell that it's a little lower quality unless you're staring at it from an inch away--and even then, it holds its own. Very pleased with this necklace--and that's way more than I usually say about jewelry ordered on Amazon :)"
5.0,They fit perfectly and are super comfortable
5.0,It's great very good material looks very lasting thanks
5.0,"I really like it. It is comfortable, it has not changed color and none of the diamonds have fallen out."

5.0,"Soft, comfy and I just love it."
5.0,"This is my third Timex Easy Reader. On the first one the batter lasted 2 years before I replaced it. I found out the replacement cost as much as buying a new one. So in my second one the battery has lasted 4 years, but I think it may be due for replacement, so that is why I opted to buy the third one....."
5.0,"Ordered a size medium and it fits great on my 5'9'' frame, 42'' chest.  It wicks the sweat away and keeps me cooler.  Will buy again."
5.0,Very cute patter and nice material. Looks exactly like the photo. Highly recommend!
5.0,Looks great in everyone!!
5.0,"I bought this for my grandson to wear while he was deer hunting, He loves it, the bluetooth works great and the speakers are loud and clear, The cap was so warm he didn't even need his orange cap on top.<br />the hat was such a hit i had to order a 2nd one for my son in law."
5.0,"Very satisfied, fast delivery handled with care."

5.0,Wrestling event
5.0,Love it! They look like little bras. I love that they don't squish your eyes shut. I love that they come in their own separate pouches and you can just throw them in your travel bag. The earplugs are a bonus especially if you're a light sleeper.

5.0,"Got the set of just white, along with the set with the peace signs on it.  Ordered a size 6 for my kids who have waist measurement of 21"" and are about 50lbs.  I was worried because they arrived and were wider in the waist than I needed, but they shrank in the waist just enough to fit them perfectly!  My kids have never been so excited about underwear before, haha!  They absolutely love them!  Fit is incredible, soft, good memory, and not scratchy.  We have tried ALL the kids undies and these are so worth the spendy price tag."
5.0,Love these earrings!!!
5.0,"very very cute skirt.  However, I usually wear a medium and the description stated that it runs small so I ordered the large but it's a little too tight!  what a shame.  I love it but had to return it."
5.0,"Although I own several watches, I find myself wearing this watch on a daily basis, whether I dress formally or wear shorts, this inexpensive watch has won me over. Very stylish, comfortable and the case thickness at just 0.6 CM is one of the best watches I've owned at a fraction of the cost I've paid for other bulkier, less stylish watches I've purchased. If you're sitting on the fence on this watch, go for it, you won't regret it both in price and style."

5.0,"I purchased this as a  birthday present for my partner. She loves it, and has used it often since she got it, when she doesn't need to carry her extra large purse.<br />  It is a high quality item at a very reasonable price. All the pockets make it very easy to separate important item."
5.0,"Somewhat on the small side of a large but still classifies as large. If you want it to be a bit more baggy versus fitted then I would go a size higher. It's pretty awesome and I love that the material brand itself is Gildan, it just means the shirt will last!"

5.0,Great bag! Much bigger than it looks in the picture. I purchased one and now everyone at work has been buying them too after seeing mine. The best feature is the zippers which extend down the length of both sides of the bag which allows you to open the bag very wide to find things or pull things out.
5.0,"good quality and fits great, thank u!!"
5.0,My sister LOVED the socks. Good quality material.
5.0,These yoga pants are so soft and stylish! I simply love how they fit! These are a must have!
5.0,"This is a really cute maxi skirt.  It features a flowing layered skirt, which is longer in the back, and shorter in the front.  It also includes a fabric belt, which is a really cute addition!  I ordered it in light blue, and I love the color in person. It will look great paired with flats, or sandal for a casual, semi formal look!  You can really dress this up or down depending on your accessories.<br /><br />As far as sizes go, I would order up a size.  I ordered my normal size, but since it was smaller than expected, I gave it to my teenage daughter, and it fits her perfectly, and she was thrilled.  So order up a size. Or two!<br /><br />The fabric is definitely a little sheer, so you will need to wear something under it, like a slip.  Overall, it's a super cute skirt.  Just order up a size.  It's really cute, and well made!<br /><br />A sample product was provided for an honest evaluation."

5.0,"I love this bracelet. I thought the clasp would come off easy, but it doesnt. I love it!!"
5.0,"Muy linda, se ve muy bien"
5.0,"With the ring in place, the hub cap will not fit in the rim.  The last tab is always too tight to be pushed in.  Tried 2 different hub caps on 2 different rims.  The ring seems very close in size to the ring on the remaining hubcaps, but this hubcap has more tabs than the existing hubcaps, meaning less flexibility.  Also, some other reviews mentioned there are 2 tabs for the ring, one tighter than the other, but there must have been a design change, because there is only a single channel for the ring in these hubcaps.<br /><br />FOLLOW UP:<br />Changed rating from 1 star to 5 star.  The company refunded my money after explaining the hubcaps did not fit.  Having nothing to lose, I tried banging one hubcap on and found with a few blows I was able to get them on.  When I initially tried, I was not willing to bang on them with enough force because I have had too much experience with plastic items breaking with not much force applied, and the old hubcaps did not take much force to put on or take off, but I was able to get all 4 on.  Will contact the company to tell them they can re-charge me, as they are now on and look good."
5.0,"The 1st few photos on the description of this tiedye tank shows more of a gradient type fabric or like a flannel type of design/look. I really liked that about it & ultimately why I chose to give it a shot. I was nervous about sizing but I got a Medium & it fits perfectly, which is hard to come by bc usually when a shirt fits my bust area, they're bagging everywhere else & often too long or vise versa....they fit everywhere else, but the bust area. I love the vibrant tiedye & the material is really soft & lightweight but alsonseems like a good quality. No stretch to it & very true to size.  Size up 1 size if u looking for a little bit of a flow to it, or stay true to size if you want a more fitted look like mine is on me. Also, the armholes are perfect size to wear a regular style bra with too, which I like!<br />All in all, I love it and would recommend, but I'll update once I get a chance to wear it a few x & when I wash it. If you're wanting a cute comfy tank with pretty colors of great quality for the price, then i would suggest going for it!"
5.0,Love this tank!!!!
5.0,Ordered this for an upcoming party.<br />Got the small and it fits well.<br />I'm 5' and 114 lbs.<br /> It's only beaded on front which makes the dress light weight.  Would recommend.
5.0,"I like the look of these glasses they look expensive and work very well, I have enjoyed using them day or night.  For my head shape they hold nicely, they do not squeeze my temples, I would be careful not to crush them by accident because they would not withstand that too well as they are made out of plastic, but if you keep them in the car and in the little pouch that is included then they should be of service for a long time.  Make sure and keep one of those microfibers cloth to wipe them from time to time like I do.  At night they are good at eliminating glare and during the day if cloudy they make everything sharper and clearer."
5.0,Same great quality as all the La Cera clothing I have bought before.
5.0,Super comfy and stays put during yoga
5.0,This sweater was perfectly sized according to the chart provided. Nice very soft material and a little thicker than a heavy t-shirt but not so thick that you sweat to death in it. My only regret is not purchasing more in different colors.
5.0,"Awesome, simply awesome!"
5.0,Just like pictures and description
5.0,So cute~ Great quality.
5.0,price
5.0,Overall it’s good
5.0,Fits perfectly based on the chart .. the material is nice and doesnt look cheap .. the inside fleece is just what you need for this weather.. Price is very competitive<br />I like.
5.0,"This outfit is super cute, The sizing is a little strange though.  0-8 months?  I took a chance on it and it's big..."
5.0,fits my glasses :)
5.0,"Slightly see through, but fits well, is flattering and has lasted several washes now"
5.0,"This is actually a super cute necklace for the price!  I am super pleased with it.  I didn't have high expectations due to the low price, but boy I was wrong on how delicate and stylish it is.  What a gem!  Glad I found this necklace."
5.0,Super soft neck gaiter.  I washed it once and it seems to get even softer.
5.0,Got this for my brother for when he's walking around campus. Great Gift!

5.0,Wish a little bigger but good for her right now

5.0,Amazing it fits and it’s a classic
5.0,It’s good quality and very beautiful.

5.0,This key pouch is great!
5.0,Adorable.  Great quality.  Nice colors.

5.0,"Ordered for myself, and I must say it is one of the best belts I've owned. Very comfortable, good materials and best of all: PERFECT FIT. I've ordered another one as a gift."
5.0,"Bought this shirt because my wife just had our baby girl and I'm a Disneyland fan. The shirt is high quality and the screen printing is pretty sturdy, meaning it should hold up nicely. Quick delivery to boot!"
5.0,"We got hit by a bad winter storm and it ended up being -35°F out, I work outside and everyone hands were cold except mine because of these gloves. For $30 these are amazing."
5.0,Really comfortable and I've gotten lots of compliments on it.
5.0,This is a cute pin. I wear it on a jacket or my winter coat.

5.0,"Love it, great design."
5.0,light and comfy.
5.0,My daughter wears a size 2. In this leo she wears a size medium. It looks very expensive and performs beautifully. Hang to dry and it will last a long time.
5.0,Works like a charm! This item turned my son's red mud shoes back into converses! Super easy to use as well.
5.0,This fits so well! Great for strength training and jogging. Best part = the pads do not come out in my washer or dryer!!! *and all the women said amen!*
5.0,IT looks & feels really nice let’s see if it can will stand all day use.
5.0,Mine came with much better tie dye placement. Can’t beat the price but SOAK before washing with other clothing or you’ll have a blue wardrobe !
5.0,So cute. Non slip and glow in the dark.
5.0,I normally wear between a small and medium or a size 3. I ordered a medium and they fit perfectly with some space. I haven’t washed them yet and they are about 70% cotton so they will shrink a little bit. I’m 5’1 and they were almost a foot too long so sorry short girls! But nothing a little alteration couldn’t fix. Overall they’re super cute! They don’t have any belt loops and have a zipper on the side so that’s the only downfall.
5.0,Pretty snap jewelry
5.0,Perfect. Soft and fits great!
5.0,Got this as a gift for someone and they loved it! Was exactly as pictured and shipped very fast!
5.0,"Love them, they go well with a labradorite slide I was given."

5.0,"Husband likes it , and is able to wear it while playing basketball. He came on time and it’s very similar to the Nike type ."
5.0,"I love the top, it was just as pictured to me but I would definitely recommend ordering up in size. Mine fit only because I ordered up 2 sizes to fit a little looser"
5.0,Love this product when you wear braids or any other “Big” hairstyles !!
5.0,I like them but ordered a size to small. I will be keeping them though.

5.0,great combination of colors!
5.0,He uses them for driving.
5.0,"My husband really needed some type of sun hat for himself because he gets really bad break outs on his face when being in the sun for too long. At the same time, he is very picky on what he likes to wear. We have tried several hats but nothing has worked out for him. This hat is more his style because he likes the camouflage. I was scared the hat may not fit him because it's a one size fits all hat. Surprisingly, the hat fits him well, and guess what he likes it. It has a spring for adjustment and it's a brim hat. I can't believe he liked it but it's made of good quality and looks really good on him. I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review."
5.0,"Well made with lock mechanism, so no worries about it coming lose. Very nice looking, and get lots of compliments."
5.0,Great Hat bought another in White.

5.0,"Buy this dress you will not be disappointed! Such a cute flattering maxi! I am short 5 ft and was worried about it being too long, but the small fits perfectly."

5.0,My granddaughter got loads and loads of compliments from her classmates on &#34;Wear Your PJs Day.&#34;
5.0,"Excellent quality.  Great hat.  Love the color selection, and love the lightweight, portability:  Fold it up and put it in a pocket if you want to take it off indoors, or pack away during a hike.  The material is very light and breathable:  sweat dries fast.  The brim is very short (just FYI).  You can toss this into the wash with the rest of your clothes and keep it clean (don't run it through the drier though).  I have purchased a couple of these and the fit is consistent between the two."
5.0,Everyone likes them & me too! 😊
5.0,"My 9 yr old Grandson loved this necklace! Definitely 'awesome'! Inexpensive, delivered in a timely manner as promised.Quality item!"

5.0,"I have several pairs, have held up well in the wash the last couple years. 110 lbs, purchased size small."
5.0,"Hubby got hearing aids for the 1st time. And we were warned they can easily be lost with putting on and off and wearing masks.  Many are losing BTE hearing aids this way.  I ordered these that can be used with our regular masks and a mask with elastic straps to go around upper head and neck  Hands down these are his favorite.<br />Comfortable as they adjust to your individual needs and easy to use...I asked if he wanted more of the other mask and he said, ""Nope, love these""!"
5.0,Its a very comfortable shoe. I love it!
5.0,This necklace is so beautiful!! I give it 5 stars because shipping was super fast nice packaging nothing broken ... Looks so beautiful on .. Recommend this piece to everyone who like statement necklaces
5.0,Great watch.
5.0,"Does look like costume jewelry, but my finger hasn't turned green, and silver hasn't turned. Very lovely ring! Definitely looks like it costs more than it does!!"
5.0,"Love the material and the fit; and delivery was instantaneous (not really) but it seemed like it. Especially after talking to one of Amazon's customer service reps., and she expedited my order from there."
5.0,"I've bought a couple of earrings similar to this and haven't liked them. This one's the perfect size and fits to my ear exactly how I want it to! It's a little loose with the ball it comes with, but I bought rubber earring backs and it makes it tight.  Easy enough fix. Awesome price, especially for two of them!"
5.0,"Loved the material, very nice dress"
5.0,"Fits well, sewed together nice and better than the cheaper ones found at Walmart and other stores. I didn't want to pay for the $100+ seat shirts, and this was perfect - good fit, nice fleece, and at an attractive price."
5.0,Love the length. Lounging in it is very comfortable.
5.0,"This hat was exactly what I had hoped for, and came at a good price! Fit and shape are excellent!"

5.0,It was what I wanted and expected.
5.0,"I had low expectations for this dress but let me tell you. I. AM. IMPRESSED. I bought it a size too big which is my fault, but even still, it fit perfectly. I’m 5’3 and I’m not tripping over my dress with my shoes on. It’s also looks exactly like the picture. 5 stars well deserved"
5.0,Cute works well on my badge holder
5.0,"Commenting on the beige bra. It is awesome! Great support and lift.  Padded perfectly so no low beams are showing (hey, when your small, your low beams are always on).<br /><br />Now I brought this due to how my shoulders hurt (fibromyalgia in shoulders)  you just can't find wide straps for small boobs. I, mean, just because we don't have HUGE ones doesn't mean we want the tiny  shoulder strap cutting into us. This give great coverage for back fat bc the small strap around us cuts in, doesn't give us support.  This bra does.  For real.<br /><br />I already gave feedback on the black and white ones. Don't buy them. Two totally different bras from the beige one."
5.0,"I just received this bag, but it is beautiful, it’s even more vivid than its pictured.  Great workmanship!"
5.0,"These shoes are great! So many shoes get pulled off or wiggled off, but the juicy bumbles have never been pulled off or wiggled out of. They are super cute and soft baby has worn his footprint in to the soft leather. I bought the another pair the next size up. I highly  recommend  these shoes."
5.0,"very fast shipping, nice product, my friends love it and me too , small little but it's fine for my hand I'm not fat"
5.0,Love them  and I get many compliments

5.0,I got this for my 2 year old niece & she absolutely loves it !
5.0,"I usually wear a US medium and I ordered an XL. It fits a perfectly on me, it's tight fitting and not loose. The material is very thick, so it's perfect for a cold winter day. The sweater looks exactly like the picture and it's super duber cute!!! Very happy with my purchase!!!"
5.0,was a gift for coworker.he thinks it is good
5.0,I LOVE THIS CUTE ASS RING!

5.0,"This dress has a very forgiving fit with a nice stretch to it, and is very flattering. I was trying to find a gold, glittery gown that would accommodate my 4 1/2 month pregnant growing belly and frame (5’2” & 140 lbs), and this dress achieved that goal! Plus, pretty good quality for the value. Very pleased with this purchase!"
5.0,Bonito regalo
5.0,I haven't wear it yet but looks just like the picture and love it
5.0,I got this for my husband and he likes the soft fabric and great fit. Says it is really comfortable. We just ordered two more. I can't keep it washed in the closet. He always wants to wear it.

5.0,Love the shirt! I would order from this company again
5.0,"Nice material, good fit"
5.0,Great fit. And comfortable
5.0,"Good quality, but was too small for me. I needed it to be larger."
5.0,"They are almost perfect. I'd take a smidge of extra depth, but overall, they are great packing organizers, and add virtually no weight to your packing."
5.0,"Fits great... better than expected. I got these for my bootcamp weightloss program. The last thing i want is to be getting my but kicked & feeling uncomfortable in what i'm wearing... (which has been my problem) these pants didn't let me down. They fit in every place...  they're comfy, strong & stretchy fabric. And they look good. I'm very pleased with these pants... i'm definitly going to order more."
5.0,My boyfriend loved them :3 very soft and comfy. They fit true to size.

5.0,"perfect...as described. stylish, good quality, fun."
5.0,"My husband loves firm fitting dresses on me. Very classy , nicely hugs my curves , very soft and super cute and sexy.  Love this dress."
5.0,"I absolutely adore this sweatshirt...it is made of quality material and construction and the colors are beautiful. The Basquiat painting it reflects is, of course, awesome!  I wore it while traveling, and several people stopped me in the airport to inquire as to what I was wearing.  Re sizing, it runs somewhat small, although the size I ordered fit me exactly as I had hoped and looked great worn as an oversized top over leggings, which did  not overwhelm me.  I ordered a size large and I am female 5’3” tall and wear junior size M/L and Misses size S.  Hope this is helpful if it comes back in stock...this is a truly wonderful item, well worth the price."
5.0,"I love this shoe by Jessica Simpson.  It is very comfortable and yet, very stylish.  At first I ordered the wrong size and had to return the shoes.  It was very simple and convenient to handle the return.  I am very happy with my purchase and with Amazon."
5.0,"Fit good, material was nicer than expected."
5.0,Fit best friend perfectly. Got it for her as a Christmas gift
5.0,"True to size, colors are nice and material is great. I recommend"
5.0,"Awesome value for the set. My 2yo is taller/larger for his age and we ordered a 4T. After a few washes, it still fits well. Thinner fabric is great as my toddler runs very warm."
5.0,comfortable and convenient.
5.0,looks great & love the ratchet system.
5.0,"I bought these for my 7 year old who is photophobic.  She was outgrowing the small kids size glasses that you can easily find in children's stores like Gymboree or Old Navy , but was still too small for the bigger kids size.<br /><br />After a bit of research I found these and decided to give them a try.  These fit her perfectly and the blue is really cute and matches everything.<br /><br />These are pretty expensive for a 7 year old so if your child is one who easily looses glasses I would look for a cheaper pair."
5.0,I love these pants.  Material at waist is fragile so we will see how they hold up in the wash.
5.0,"I really loved the breathability of the material. Very well vented. I've used it riding both atv and dirtbike. I drive a Can-am 850 and a KTM 350.  I usually wear a XL but ktm clothing usually run small. I've compared standard Troy Lee Designs XL with KTM TLD and former is definitely tighter. Point a reference I'm about 6'2 250lbs, I excercise so I'm fairly wide. I wear a 48 regular I'm suit jackets"
5.0,"Great looking watch for a great price! Don't think, just buy. It is totally worth it!!! Nice look to it and no scratches. It came packaged like new."
5.0,Spacious!
5.0,They are great for replacement. Came in great and on time. These are great to change color anytime
5.0,Great price and fits right.
5.0,Really nice thick weight and engraving!
5.0,"Very nice, just as described"
5.0,My daughter has very sensitive ears. But these earrings work perfect for her. No problems at all. Great for batman fans!
5.0,"I’m constantly on the go and I like wearing short clothes during the warmer season . I HAVE had ... uhm...”accidents “ in the past where my skirts were short enough that people saw a glimpse of my underwear while I was simply passing by ! *gasp!!!!!****<br /> I needed something that looks good , is still comfortable yet not prone to causing those types of mishaps . I’m not exactly a tennis player , but still!<br />When I saw this skirt , I told myself “why not !?!!” So I bought it . It ended up being a fantastic idea since I got something light , easy to match to all sorts of tops , and true to its size .<br />But don’t just take my word for it ! Feel free to take a look at the shots I posted with this review of mine . Might I also add : I’m a size 14! and I usually look it , unless I get in the right clothes . What a slimming effect ! This makes me look like I’m a size 10. It’s crazy what a good quality garment can do in terms of how you show up .<br />The “security shorts “ inside the skirts fit seamlessly, you won’t even know they’re there , provided you’re buying the right size . I still had skirts like that in the past , where the shorts underneath literally rode my #ss . I’m so relieved to report , you will feel like you simply have a comfortable short skirt and you will very likely forget about the shorts underneath anyways .<br />Dressing as you prefer to doesn’t have to be complicated , I’m actually almost tempted to get myself a second one ."
5.0,Great NATO watch band. I wear this working construction daily and it hold up to everything.
5.0,It looks just like the photo and fits perfectly! The holes make it breathable and the silicone makes for a nice feel. It even comes with some scratch protectors for the screen!
5.0,"great dress! The length is perfect, it hits me right at the knee.  I am 5'7."
5.0,Super pretty and delicate
5.0,This is so unique and cool! Totally goes with my octo themed bathroom
5.0,"Looks great on and fits perfect, arrived next day after ordering"
5.0,Cute dress. Good quality fabric and stitching.  And  IT HAS POCKETS! I am 5' 4&#34; 120 lbs. right now.  My measurements are 35-28-35.5. I ordered a medium.  It's pretty loose but not too big. I think I would have liked the fit of a small better but the medium is definitely o.k. It's not designed to be a form fitting dress. The length comes a little closer to my knees than on the model. Definitely recommend this dress.
5.0,"Very nice charm, purchased for my wife and she loves it. The charm is a nice piece and we'll made."
5.0,It is so pretty. I love it so much I order two for my sisters.
5.0,I liked the pull ribbon inside to help make the hat fit snuggly.
5.0,Love the purple.
5.0,I think it's a beautiful dress and fits nicely. 2 XL for size 12
5.0,"My son loves them so far. We bought them to help keep the bugs/ticks off his legs so I didn't have to spray his regular shoes with deet. We don't do a lot of strenuous hikes, so they're holding up well and do what they're supposed to."
5.0,Even prettier than they look! The little stones pick up the color of your top and look even nicer. Love these!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:126859cace6c53975c31fb700cd2637d]] I really like these socks.  The material is thick enough so I think they’ll last quite a while, but thin enough that I can wear them with my tennis shoes when I’m on my way to somewhere else.<br /><br />This is my first experience with yoga socks.  Although I have some hospital socks that have grips on the bottom…these socks *really* grip.  I wear socks around the house a lot because I have cold feet.  But I gotta tell you that the first time I walked onto the tile kitchen floor with these on I almost face planted…because I stopped.  Boom.<br /><br />This is a three pack with 3 different color patterns.  Not very feminine choices in the pack that I received, but hey if they’re good socks I don’t care.<br /><br />The size is a good fit for me.  I am a size 8.5 and they’re not too tight…but they are snug.  Make sure that you don’t get them too loose or they’re not going to grip when you need them to.  They say they’ll fit up to a size 9 and I think they probably would.<br /><br />The price also feels like a good value to me for what you get…3 pairs of very nice socks with good grip.  So big yes on these."
5.0,This dress is so comfortable and lays nicely.  I'm only 5ft 4in so this dress is long enough for me to wear to work.
5.0,We both like it
5.0,"I've only been using this wallet for a few days, so maybe with time the stitching could come apart inside, but that could happen with any wallet. After reading some 1-star reviews, I took mine out to check over the strength of the stitching and overall quality, and I must say mine is a very well made wallet and I love it. And I am not one who is hesitant to toss a cheaply sewn wallet because it looks hideous. I'm not sure if the two clasps are meant to click together, but mine doesn't. However, the wallet stays together because of the hinges on the side. I put change/money in one of the clasp compartments, and my extra cards/coupons/stamps in the other. The slots are not as tight in some wallets, so I was able to fit several cards that I use more often in one slot. I have stuck my phone in the large side pocket and it is so roomy I could put just about anything I'd need in it to run into a store or take into a restaurant and set on the table near me. Am very satisfied with this purchase!"
5.0,Durable and cute!
5.0,"Look is retro explorer, fit is great."
5.0,Easy to adapt to size and great looking
5.0,I have purchased these hats for my granddaughters and they love their hats!<br />Excellent quality and so cute❤️
5.0,Love this coverup for the summer.  It’s perfect weight and looks great in over a bathing suit.  There are no care instructions which would be helpful because of the material.
5.0,I absolutely love these sunglasses! I would definitely recommend!
5.0,Soft material. Easy to pull on. Fits in all the right places without clinging.
5.0,"These are great for my 3 month old.  We are able to go to places with a lot of noise and we can put these on him, and he can still take his nap. Glad we decided to give them a try!"
5.0,Better then I thought
5.0,Very pretty. Love the wallet with wrist strap
5.0,These party hats were ok. They got the job done. They only fit the kids though.
5.0,"Got these as a gift for X-mas, by far the best pair of socks I own! You can tell they are made with care! You will not be disappointed."
5.0,"Product as described, great quality and fast shipping.  I will no hesitate to order from this seller again.  Thank You!!"

5.0,This purse is awesome! I use it all the time. Perfect size. I am able to wear it in many things and nice enough for an casual evening out. I may need to buy more colors
5.0,So simple and easy fit. I am actually wearing it today. Cute!
5.0,Great pajama bottoms. Fit my son perfectly. So soft and warm and well made.
5.0,I’ve been wearing 2 pairs for several weeks. Comfortable even with my headphones on and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments since my earrings are one of the few things you can still see with my mask on.
5.0,"Smelled funny, but I put dryer sheets in the pockets. Looks durable. I'm using it as a gift bag for my teenage daughter, filling all the pockets with presents. I think she's going to love it."
5.0,color and name attached
5.0,Really cute and fun for a themed summer camp.
5.0,Overall pleased.<br />A bit pricey for 3 socks.<br />Velcro from diapers can stick to these well and create fuzzies. They looked very used after 3 weeks of use.<br />They leave harmless indentations on skin from the grippies that keep them on babies feet.
5.0,Dress looks just like the picture
5.0,"gave as a gift, i didn't realize the size, its a little big for what he wanted. nice cross."
5.0,"Perfect, fits just right and the material is very good quality. I’m impressed for $5 + prime shipping 👌🏼"
5.0,Love them....fit perfect
5.0,I bought these for my father-in-law for his birthday and he really enjoyed them. Wears them to play golf and for every day activities. It's hard to buy something like this for another person without trying it on first but was exactly as described and the metal was durable and looked high-end. Came in a nice box perfect for gifting.
5.0,"A cute and simple charm, perfect for my jewelry making. I only got a few to see if they were good enough, and I loved them. I am totally going to get more."
5.0,Wife loves it and wears it when doing moderate to high intensity workouts without any negative comments.
5.0,"So I ordered this dress twice. I ordered a Large at first. Those .5 inches means a lot in the breast area, it was a little too tight. SO I really wanted the dress and  reordered an XL and absolutely love the fit and will be purchasing this dress in red as well."
5.0,Got alot of compliments on my scrub
5.0,Great bands
5.0,Just love them no more balls. So easy the best thing for massive Piercings
5.0,"they fit great ,comfortable"
5.0,Gorgeous and came quick thanks
5.0,"These shirts are beautiful. I've ordered both the yellow and the green ones. The material is light are comfortable. It is vaguely see-through but only if I wear a patterned/bright bra underneath.I am normally a size Small. I ordered the Medium, and I love it. It's a little more flowy this way and drapes nicely. I think the small would fit fine too, but I wouldn't hesitate sizing up if you are not sure."
5.0,Absolutely perfect in Alaska!  I Luv them!
5.0,"I purchased this for my daughter-in-law, mother of two boys.  She loves it!"
5.0,I love how these gloves look and how comfortable they are.
5.0,Great fit comfortable and looks great
5.0,"I bought this watch because I was looking for a waterproof watch to take out surfing, and not yuck up my nice watch with a metal band.  I thought I'd get the usual clunky rubberized sports watch, then I stumbled on this.  I loved the look, especially the woven band, and was surprised to see it's waterproof rating.  For the price (way less than a sports watch) I thought I'd give it a go - and if it failed, I'd either just buy another one, or try something else.  Six months later, after surfing 2 to 3 times a week since buying, it is still ticking, still looks great, and I wear it out about 50% of the time instead of my nice metal watch."
5.0,I bought this lovely petite pair of earrings as a gift for my lovely petite mother in law.  They were made very nicely and the gemstones were perfectly matched. She loves them.
5.0,Awesome product! I have terrible knees and I can wear these all day (I'm a teacher). Wonderful! Looking to get another color!
5.0,"This piece of jewelry is super cute!! The pictures in the review don't do it justice! I purchased this for my cartilage piercing, but the bar is a little too thick. I am trying to stretch it out for it to fit. The opal center is really pretty. Love everything about it."
5.0,This worked perfectly to keep my key fob to gain access to restricted areas at work. This is fashionable and serves a great purpose.
5.0,Fits good & pulls everything in & smooth everything out. Also gives the butt a nice smooth shape. I weigh 228 & 5'11 & I can not wait to wear it.
5.0,"I was a bit skeptical of this because I always, always choose a large, relatively structured totes with a cute, hippie pattern.  So, yeah, this was way out of my comfort zone!  But I am so glad I got it!!!  Now I did receive this in exchange for my honest feedback here.  I'm so glad this review opportunity came up bec a use this bag is perfect for me and my lifestyle.<br /><br />Pros: very cute, fun color.  Color very similar to as pictured in listing<br /><br />Made of a nylon type material.  Washes up easily and dries fast and protects your belongings if it gets wet. Keep my stuff safe when I was caught in a rainstorm.<br /><br />Adjustable straps so you can wear it crossbow or on one shoulder.<br /><br />Many pockets for organization.  I keep my cell phone in one and keys in another.  No more dumping my whole bag looking for these things.  A handy third, outside zippered pocket for papers/coupons/ etc.  Rarely even have to open bag!<br /><br />Summer just started and it so useful for going to the pool and parks etc.  Extremely lightweight, but takes a beating.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I mean, it's not an evening bag. But it's not intended to be one anyhow."
5.0,"I used this one year as a skirt for a little mermaid costume. And the next as a tube top style shirt for a fish costume. It worked great for both! It fit me for both, and I'm a big girl. Size 18/20 or 2x most of the time. If you wear it on your hips or waist, it is long enough, but tends to ride up. So I decided to wear it on my high waist, which worked great, but was a little shorter than I'd normally wear. However, I paired it with the multi color scale leggings, so it worked great!"
5.0,"These are great, super cute eveyday shirts.  My daughter likes the color and fit."
5.0,Bought this as a surprise for my picky daughter. She loves it and wears it everyday- so glad I got it for her
5.0,Got the balaclava for my husband. He wore in °9 weather snowmobiling. It kept his head warm under his helmet.
5.0,Great fit for a waterhead like me!
5.0,"Perfect size for phone, credit cards, and more. Notable quality for the price. Purses bother me when I shop. This one is small and can go over the chest with ease and without discomfort."
5.0,Fits exactly like a 3t should. Gave this to my niece for Christmas and she was in love with the adorable unicorn! The sequet sleeves was what sold me on this little jacket.. so trendy and cute!
5.0,Great hat! fits amazing. 10 out of 10 will recommend
5.0,"I bought this bag to start exercising on breaks at work, but I honestly use it for everything! I use it for traveling, exercising, even just as an extra storage bag (my family plays a lot of board games and you’d be surprised how many fit in this bag haha). It’s great, I love it, so glad I bought it!"
5.0,Super reflective ! great for night riding!
5.0,"Great buy! Born and raised in China, I have a good idea what the prices of stuff are in China and this is a really good bargain. Soft and comfortable, great for driving in cold days (but the leather makes it a bit slippery to grab the wheel). My husband bought these gloves as an early X'mas gift to me. I love them!"
5.0,"I just love it,  as picture!"
5.0,"Super cozy, cute sweatshirt, but I would've sized down."
5.0,I received my package today and it came with a variety of sizes half of the sizes were too big but I got half that I can wear on multiple fingers which is awesome considering some of the reviews I saw. I love that variety since I will have options to share with friends this amazing stone that can help many with it's powerful benefits!
5.0,Bought as a gift. Very soft. Fit as expected
5.0,Cutest turtle bracelet ever!
5.0,Great hat no complaints
5.0,I like oversized glasses & these are HUGE. It’s helpful because it’s very sunny where I live. Quality is great & the price was fair. I’ll definitely be purchasing more glasses in different colors.
5.0,Great ring. I haven't had any problems with the finish or jewels. I love the mid finger aspect and it fits perfectly.  This is one of my favorite mid finger rings that I have. I would highly recommend this for anyone.
5.0,Nice  Hat good color.
5.0,"Solid feel, even when looking down they don't slide down my nose. The bayonet temples make them easy on and off, and the Polarization is a bonus.<br /><br />If I had one wish to change something on the glasses, I would change the purple hue of the lenses."
5.0,Classy and glam look.
5.0,These were perfect for my hippie themed party!
5.0,"I have purchased three of these (one for my wife and I each, and an additional because she lost hers making a snowman...) these are a hard metal we've had ours eight months and they've held up in a shop environment and still have the design. Our are a little beat up now, but they are the best deal!! They arived on time with a pretty box and they are worth more and have lasted longer than I paid for them."
5.0,I love these bands they are easier getting on and off then the normal band.
5.0,"These plugs fit snuggly, the assortment of colors for the price is amazing. I bought them for my significant other, as she wanted plugs but didn't want her wallet torn apart by local prices, so I surprised her by gifting her these and showing her the link. She loves them so far, so and so that she  will most likely buy more later on."
5.0,"Got them for my boyfriend for hunting... he is a fair weather hunter and always cold, but he is happy with these"
5.0,"Good product,  great price"
5.0,"Soft silky material that hangs nicely.  Surprised at the fit. I am a size 12/14 and this one size all actually fit.  It was still a bit loose in fact.  As far as a dress on my size however, no, but I knew that from previous reviews. I'm 5'5&#34; tall and this stopped right at the bottom of my butt. I paired it with a dark brown nylon mini skirt and it looks great.<br />For size reference: it fit me loose and perfect and I am<br />5'5&#34; tall<br />194lbs.<br />38D"
5.0,this is awesome
5.0,"I love this dress! I bought one in three different sizes, the M dress fit as expected the shirt part came right to the waist line.. the L and XL shirt part appeared to be shorter similar to a half shirt... I suggest getting a size larger if you want the shirt part of the dress to come to your waistline"
5.0,Fits well - comfortable and looks good
5.0,my son love this! He was so happy! great design
5.0,"These pins are very nice and well made. Clever, too!"
5.0,Its good that its fits a woman wrist
5.0,"I bought this becuz my old one was wearing out and this has a built in system to add a power brick to the pack complete with a power cord to power a cellphone, a camera, etc. The size is just right and the material is really nice and appeals to me.<br /><br />For the price, get one for you and your significant other."
5.0,"I love these Yoga capris ... These are the most comfortable pants I have ... great for relaxing or actually doing yoga. I was a little skeptical when I ordered these as I usually wear xl or xxl and it seems when I have tried on other brands they ran very small. I was presently surprised when these arrive and they fit perfect , were super comfortable and washed like a dream !!! Love these ..."
5.0,"Wonderful variety of colors, great quality!  Really enjoying it!"
5.0,My daughter loved this so much!!! It's beautifull and the fabric is good.
5.0,"Quality is very nice. I haven't given it to the person yet because this is a gift but I hope they like it a lot. Blue is my favorite color and will in fact always choose this for someone because you can never go wrong with blue. In any case, the product itself is very nice and smooth and probably comfortable. Again can't really say anything until the person I'm giving it to tells me what they think so i'll update in a few weeks to tell you what they think."
5.0,"I haven't bought these beanies on Amazon but have bought them at a similar price from an Asian company. I intend to buy more here. I can't say enough good things about the quality and comfort of these beanies. They are also versatile. If you don't like a real slouchy beanie, you can turn the beanie inside out, roll the ends up over the sides, then turn the beanie outside out. Then you have an attractive small beanie with nice pleating in the back. I am an older woman trying to let my hair grow out, so I need something a little more conservative than the slouchy. I even wear them in the house because they are do soft and comfortable"
5.0,"Great dress for any occasion! Super comfy and fit perfect. It is long (I got Medium, I'm 5'8&#34;, 135 lbs) but if you are wearing heels it's fine."
5.0,"Great pair of earmuffs, very warm, and actually stretches well to cover both ears (a problem for some of the other pairs of earmuffs I have).  Pretty quick delivery, nice price, no complaints."
5.0,"Perfect for our bloody bathroom scene. It looks real and even dries realistic looking. I've been able to use one bottle for two years in a row and it's ready to go for a third, so it doesn't dry up and you get plenty of bang for your buck."
5.0,"I really like the fit of this shirt, though the fabric is thinner than I expected, it's still a winner!"
5.0,Awesome. Exactly as described.
5.0,Nice little figure for those hobby enthusiast that needs 2 3/4&#34;  size figure. Nicely done.
5.0,Comfortable. Has got additional pieces of cloth to make it wider
5.0,the hoodie is nice i ordered a medium and im 5 ft so keep this in mind when you pick your size<br />pros<br />soft<br />nice color<br />cons<br />NONE
5.0,Just the size I needed and it is strong. I can put so much into this tote and I love it.
5.0,"I have a 42 inch chest and the medium is perfect! It almost has a Jersey Style back and the entire front is mostly a silk screen feel. Hard to describe but it feels good and I am happy with it. Perfect for the 4th of July, or ANY day."
5.0,It was just what I expected and fit perfectly! It ironed nicely and was very comfortable all night.
5.0,I really like this color.  The red does not stand out like in the picture.  It is subdued and it is rich and darkly stained.  So aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
5.0,Bought them for my vacation. Loved them so much only wore them once so I wouldn't mess them up.
5.0,Beautiful dress and very comfortable fabric! I'm 5'4 and 110lbs the small fit perfectly and I got a lot of compliments.
5.0,"Love it, perfect fit. Super cute. I’m 5’9” and it wasn’t too short"
5.0,Love these socks.  I ordered them and they were delivered as scheduled.  I would recommend them to a friend.
5.0,Perfect fit over my glasses. Dark enough in bright sun and comfortable to wear. Love them because people don't know they are fitovers!
5.0,Clear easy to use loop.  Nice case.  Great value.  Shows all the details of coin varieties like repunched mint marks.
5.0,"good quality, as advertised. been using a couple of months and no issues, no leather flaking, no broken latches. thank you."
5.0,Exactly as described. Arrived super fast.
5.0,"I like this casual long sleeve blouse, the fit was spot on and I will possibly order more in the future."
5.0,"I've been searching for some high powered, comfortable, inexpensive readers.  Found them!"
5.0,"This bag is so cute I just love it.  It is medium size and holds lots of makeup, great for travel ."
5.0,"Looks just like the picture. Green is a lime green, not too aqua. If you want it to hug your curves, pick your size. I went 1 size bigger = my size but roomy."
5.0,Got it for a friend of my daughter for Christmas. She was happy with it.
5.0,Great purchase! It was exactly what my sister in law &#34;pinned&#34; on her pinterest board but it was cheaper than the site that she pinned it from. Very happy with purchase
5.0,I bought this for my dad. He said they are the best masks he has had. Easy to breath and fits comfortably.
5.0,18 month more like 16
5.0,I'm extremely happy with this item very warm and comfortable. fits very well
5.0,Would recommend this product
5.0,Great price and very bright vibrant colors
5.0,Very pleased. Just as listed
5.0,Love these jogging suits so much I ordered 2 more!  The material is a good quality and is very comfortable. Love that the pants have pockets!  The only recommendation I have is to order a size up if you are looking for a little more roominess. I’m usually a size Medium (5’2” and 138). The medium pants were snug fitting so I returned it and ordered a Large. It’s perfect!
5.0,"It's a good boot on a good price.<br />Good quality and comfort. I use it for my girlfriend's catwoman cosplay. It's perfect.<br />The main problem was the size. It goes smalles than regular shoes.<br />So, make shure you buy at least one number up."
5.0,I love this thing! It's small and adorable and geeky and I'm so happy I bought it
5.0,Looks lovely!
5.0,my friend loved tgus as a graduation present
5.0,"This bag is great. Very well made for the price. It came sooner than expected. I use it to store my wallet, keys, cellphone, earbuds and hand sanitizer. All these items used to weigh down my pockets so I then decided to get a backpack to carry them and that didn't feel secure when traveling through the city and it was also very hot on my back in the southern California sun. This bag is the perfect resolution for that problem. I am a rather large person so the strap is a bit snugger than it is on the models in these photos but it doesn't feel awkward or look bad at all."
5.0,"I haven't washed this pretty cardigan yet, and I'll say the fabric is pretty thin so it may wear down sooner rather than later, but with that said I love the way it looks and how lightweight it is. &lt;3"
5.0,Good for bigger feet
5.0,"I bought this bag several years ago and love it. It’s held up magnificently and looks almost as nice now as when first purchased, (just a little broken in). Plenty of room for a laptop, some files and necessities. I was thinking about getting another and came back online to see what brand this one was. Highly recommended."
5.0,Love this hat! Good quality!
5.0,"Beautiful shade,😎"
5.0,"Very beautiful, love the quality and I made a good choice."
5.0,These are great running shorts.  I like the back pocket that zips.  I also use them for swimming in my local lake.  The inside liner is well made and holds everything together...
5.0,I ordered the gold in the Leaf Ear Crawlers!!  4 compliments in 3 wearings!!  Easy to use and look great!!  Recommend!
5.0,They were a gift for my daughter and she loved them.
5.0,"Great product, great price, great shipping, and my son loves them"
5.0,Works perfectly does exactly want I need
5.0,"Material is thicker. Pockets ,  Not a lot of stretch, very comfortable,  warm,  Nice coloring. Very cute"
5.0,"I am allergic to everything except  stainless steel, 14K gold and the even more expensive metals, but I thought ""Why not give these a try even though they are 'just' gold PLATED?"", and amazingly, they have been fine!  Thank you for this product. I hope  plating wears well, but they're INEXPENSIVE,so I'd buy another pair."
5.0,"I bought this to dress up as genie for Halloween, it made a great costume. Would recommend"
5.0,was a gift to my son.  Holds up well.
5.0,Perfect! Comfortable! Like wearing your pajamas! Absolutely love it! Got 3 this brand and they all fit like a great!
5.0,Cute keychain. Bought as a gift
5.0,Loved it! Fit and length were just what I was looking for. Have already ordered two more colors!
5.0,I have never been so satisfied with an Amazon dress purchase. Fits as expected. Normally a 10-12 5'3 170 and the Large fit without looking inappropriately tight.
5.0,I love this wallet. It allows me to carry all my cards without making a bulky wallet. It has plenty of card slots to fit all your cards comfortably. I love the zipper compartment too. Allows you to store cash or loose change. I hope it lasts with time and doesn't fall apart on me. I will update if there's any change.
5.0,"Fit as expected, son loved it."
5.0,Perfect for working out. Easy to pop on and feels secure/well made.
5.0,Got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. Very cute package and great quality. Highly recommend.
5.0,"Very pretty,good price. Great shipping."
5.0,"There are other stuff cheaper, but I just wanna keep all my straps consistent for like lengths and stuff."
5.0,Her cute dress! I advise to buy your direct size or one size smaller it has a lot of stretch.
5.0,This is my second order from Crazee Wear. Never disappointed.
5.0,This dress is really great quality! I ordered a Medium. I'm 5'5 and 160lbs. Fits perfect!
5.0,These earrings are adorable!!
5.0,These gloves are so versatile for any occasion. They definitely vamp up any outfit and are really practical as well as pretty—very feminine for anyone who loves that look.
5.0,"Smaller than I thought, however I love this bag! The bag is of great quality and has turned into the only one I continue to carry."
5.0,I really love how this fits on me and I love that it has pockets!!
5.0,"So cool it’s perfect, very heavy but still perfect and doesn’t pull down your jeans"
5.0,"It fits well, just like freya bra products. It is in UK sizing, which i think might confuse some people."
5.0,Little smaller than I thought but still adorable.
5.0,Fits true to size. Looks fantastic!
5.0,Perfectly fit and can be used in winter. Material is pretty good.
5.0,I love these earrings and find that it's one of my favorite pairs for every day!
5.0,"I love these so much, they are my go-to pants! Th crotch does sit a little low so you need to wear them high-waisted which is a little annoying. This then causes the pockets to sit low and can look a little funny if you aren't wearing a longer top."
5.0,"These are exactly as shown in the ad. Look at the photo, and that's how they fit me.  I took a chance with the size, since I am used to waste sizes with jeans. I wear a 27 or 28 waist jean. So I looked up the levi size chart because they make jean shorts like this style, and ordered the size 4 based on their chart. and they fit. In fact these shorts say size 27 on them. It'd be nice to offer up all the sizes in the ad, and list both sizes, 4  and size 27.  I was worried, and now I'm super excited that this worked out.<br /><br />There is a lot of great stretch in the fabric. The color and style is exactly as shown in the ad. They are short, cuffed, an fit well around my leg so that they are not hot pants, if you remember those.  They are long enough that they are not uncomfortable or too revealing. They are short though, and they are mid rise, coming up to just below the belly button and in the back they rise to the small of my back. No more hip hugger shorts. The butt is good and roomie. They have some curve to them so I believe that if you are curvy they'll work. They do not flatten the bootie. These fit very similar to my favorite shorts.  I just hope they live as long as my favorites have.<br /><br />The stitching and cut a good quality. The zipper and button closure are good. The zipper works well and the catch works so it is not falling down. The pockets are real and usable.<br /><br />They wash up easy, normal cold wash and tumble dry.  5 stars, good value."
5.0,Very soft and true to size. Looks just like the photos .
5.0,Cute bigger glasses. If you want statement sunglasses get these. I have the mirrored ones and they are my new fav glasses. Not too heavy either actually pretty light wear but not cheap filling
5.0,It fits my 16year old perfectly and she loves Haikyuu!
5.0,"They Fit very well, light and sturdy."
5.0,I wear mine with dress slacks and summer shirts.  I feel sure they will last longer than the braided synthetics I used to buy.
5.0,"Items were perfect, my mom loves her gift. Items were delivered on time. Only wish they hadn't bugged me so much to write a review."
5.0,Fast shipping and the scarf is beautiful and made with quality!
5.0,I got it for my mom for mother's day and she loved it! It is a cheap material so you get what you pay for but it is precious!
5.0,Nice pendant. Perfect size. Unisex necklace. Great for crystal energy healing on the go.⭐️
5.0,Best glasses I have ever purchased for my son. He loves them!
5.0,"I LOVED this!  I bought it to wear on vacation-it is comfortable and very supportive which I was surprised about.  Having a large chest (36DD) I didn't expect a shelf bra to offer much of any support but I was wrong!  It is bright, comfortable and functional!"
5.0,This is the best Boba Fett shirt I have ever seen.  Great quality.  My son loves it.
5.0,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he deemed it a 5 Star.  That says a lot because he is very, very picky.  He told me I'd picked a winner.  Very pleased with it."
5.0,"Really nice newsboy/paper boy (Peaky Blinders) hat.  I have a big head, fitted cap size 7 1/2 (approx 60 cm circumference), with very voluminous hair and this cap fits nicely.  I like my hats to sit &#34;over&#34; my head and not to be atop.  The top is more pillowey and loose, and not sleek or structured like a kangol cap - i like it a lot especially for the price."
5.0,Bought for travel.  Easy to change style.  Love these!
5.0,"Article looks very good to the body, it was what I expected and I recommend it."
5.0,This is just the right size and it's good quality.
5.0,Beautiful and I love it! Love the color of Malachite!
5.0,"I purchased this a size bigger because of the reviews, and I'm glad that I did because it fits me just fine! I love it and hope to buy others like it soon. I love the shape of it and the feel of it. If you're modest, I suggest to wear a camisole underneath so you won't have to keep pulling the top to cover excess cleavage. I will be purchasing this again!"
5.0,I love these glasses. They are big and fabulous !!
5.0,Husband loves them.  Perfect for men who work with their hands day in and day out.
5.0,Hat looks great!
5.0,"Bought this as a present for my mother. So glad this was in a v-neck, which is one of the few collar styles she likes. It fit well, though we ordered a size up to be safe."
5.0,"This bracelet is very pretty. While it is lightweight,  it's not flimsy.  If you wear a size 7 in a link bracelet,  go up a full size. I tried a 7-1/2 and had to return it. The 8 fits perfectly. This is well worth the money.  The item was well packaged and arrived quickly.  I might buy another one!"
5.0,I love this bag! It was awesome for our beach trip. I love all the compartments. It made it easier to carry and find everything while at the beach. It was easy to shake the sand off it. I highly recommend.
5.0,such a pretty dress on! has great stretch and is very flattering. can't wait to wear it!!
5.0,Great shorts only like New York when Bernard King play with them
5.0,"Just moved over my cards from my old wallet to this new one! And Wowzers!! Look no further ladies and gentlemen. Well ladies if it’s for the husband. He will love it. Got my license, Costco, debit and credit card so 4 cards. Not super flat. But my prediction is that it will settle in. Color is wonderful. Now i gotta go But some boots to match with it."
5.0,Russell sweatshirts have a good quality.
5.0,"Very nice watch. I love that is big but not too over powering. Just awesome!!! I love my watches, so I know what I am talking about. Get yourself one.<br /><br />Best,<br />Tom"
5.0,This face mask is breathable.
5.0,very nice!!!
5.0,"Great fit, would buy more"
5.0,My daughter loves this shirt. I’ve washed it a few times and it still looks good. I will say that this not not your normal hoodie material. It’s a little thicker than a long sleeved t shirt. Overall it’s very cute.
5.0,These are easy to use and you get a perfect fit for you.
5.0,"Las perlas tienen un hermoso oriente.  Los aretes son muy versátiles, elegantes o informales.  Muy satisfecha con la compra."
5.0,Very comfortable Socks absolutely love the colors I wear a size 9 in women’s and they fit perfect
5.0,"This is ridiculously useful - holds all of the things I need, with a loop on the top to pull out of my backpack quickly (and hang it on my desk!). Straps are tight but stretchy enough to hold a pen case, back pocket is voluminous to hold a planner if the pocket is unzipped, and it's really sturdily made. I'm not concerned about it ripping, ever. My one small complaint is that it came slightly warped inwards, which bends whatever I have in the back pocket; this isn't a big concern for me. I've read about these for a while and am surprised but happy that it lived up to the hype!"
5.0,great fit!
5.0,These socks fit very well and stay on baby’s feet. They are super cute too
5.0,Love this bracelet and it’s beautiful tones and colors. Perfect size for me as it’s actually not huge on my wrist like most bracelets. I could look at it all day. Great purchase
5.0,"Soft leather and it's the perfect size. Holds my cash, cards, and checkbook."
5.0,"It's not too often I order clothing online but, glad I did! The dress is beautiful. It does run a bit small from the top but I managed to zip it up :)<br /><br />Received so many compliments! Thank you"
5.0,"Bought this to replace the chain on my Felicie puochette and I couldn’t be happier! I much prefer this strap Over the original chain strap! Hardware is sturdy and a good non-brassy tone. I got the red and it’s a nice red…not too bright with blue undertones. The strap material is flexible, with a nice feel to it. I do wish the glazing was a matching red color instead of black. That would have made it PERFECTION! Otherwise good buy and happy with purchase!"
5.0,"Beautiful, unique, handmade product<br />Thank you<br />Om mani padme hum"
5.0,"I got this for a friend who had just recently lost his mother, he has told me he loves it!"
5.0,"Leggings were long enough to cover my whole leg & then some.  They also were tight enough to stay up but loose enough not to look bad around my thighs. Love them, I'm so glad I ordered them"
5.0,"Very comfortable and the sizing is very forgiving for a smaller body type as well as stretching to a larger type.  However it can be confusing at first to actually put on and wear but once you get it, it does make it much easier for the next time to put on.  The straps on mine were sewn on fine, however they could easily be strengthened with a little stitching for people who want a sturdier piece."
5.0,"I got this for my sister, who was born in February, as a Christmas present. It comes in a nice gift box so it is ready for gift giving and it is a very attractive set for those who like to have their jewelry big enough to be seen. Fit seems true to size and the earrings stay in place."
5.0,Perfect size for what I needed.  Great price
5.0,"Love my Enso ring! As a Gymnastics coach, wearing my wedding band and engagement ring can sometimes be a problem. It can get stuck in equipment, or scratch my gymnasts when I am spotting them. This is a fantastic way to still show I am taken without risk of damaging my rings on equipment, or scratching my athletes by accident. I was worried about how it may feel before it arrived, but it fits nicely and I hardly notice it is there."
5.0,I divided the earrings between my grand daughters and daughter-in-law. The grand daughters were very excited with the verity they got to pick from. They had a hard time deciding which ones to chose because they wanted them all.
5.0,I wanted this to wear under a sweater and this one fit really well. I'm going to order more in different colors. Good product.
5.0,"This ring is absolutely gorgeous!  The Diamond color is rich and vibrant, and the stones match perfectly.  A great buy!"
5.0,love this dress. I got a small and it fits well enough that I kept it but I think an x-small would have been better. 5'4&#34; 110lbs
5.0,Perfect fit and super comfortable! Love them!!
5.0,Love love this hoodie!!! Fits great right size great quality
5.0,"Very well made.  I was hoping the sole would be more firm for better arch support because my flat feet can totally demolish the cushy arch support.  But they are very comfortable and my heel is supported, so my plantar faciitis hasn't flared up.  I'm impressed."
5.0,love it's feeling and usefulness
5.0,"Beautiful and stylish, well made coat."
5.0,"They are very cute, and the color is pretty. My niece likes walking in them. Great product."
5.0,Love his dress.  Great material and great fit
5.0,No real support but it is a slipper. Super cute very light weight !  Very satisfied with this purchase !
5.0,"I am in love with this swimwear! I got the navy color, it is amazing and very beautiful. I thought it would be cheaper quality  because of its modest price, but it is not.<br />The quality is very good and it is very comfortable. I am considering buying another colors. The size I ordered fits me as expected.<br /><br />Disclaimer. I received this product with a discount to give my honest review about this specific product. I was not influenced by the seller to write a good a review, but rather I gave my honest review.<br />when I write reviews, I rate the product by the following labels:<br />1 star: I hate it.<br />2 stars: I do not like it.<br />3 stars: It is okay.<br />4 stars: I like it.<br />5 stars: I love it.<br />this product deserves 4 stars and i suggest them to others."
5.0,Washed it after i got it. Fits great! Glad i bought it
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish.  I will order another in a different color.
5.0,Great product! Great trail! Made the perfect gift for my friends hiking the CDT!
5.0,These compression shorts have changed my life. as a runner i hate things jiggling when i run and these help tremendously in that regard with my phone. I slip my phone in there and use my wireless headphones. Go for a run and never think about it again. Great product. I keep buying more!
5.0,My brother used my Prime account to order these support stockings. He said Not only was the price fantastic but these are the absolute best socks he has ever purchased! He will definitely buy these again.<br /><br />The first purchase he received a discount to buy again and he immediately used the discount coupon and purchased another pair. He has a lot of trouble with his legs as a guard he is on his feet a lot and he has had issues with thrombosis and other blood clotting issues. These socks have saved him in many ways. He will for sure be a regular customer and highly recommends the socks. The seller is great the product is fantastic and they arrived in a very quick amount of time. Thank you!
5.0,Great price and quality.  Truly a handsome and exceptionally well made shirt.
5.0,These boots were the prefect style for my Work Christmas party. Soo comfortable from the first time I put them on.
5.0,Comfortable supporting quality sandal. My 21 month old uses this heavy for few weeks and still in nice condition even after getting soaking wet by mistake
5.0,"My daughter lives in these jeans!  They are super cute and high quality!  The fabric is soft, stretches, but does not stretch out in the knee or butt.  The design is not overly loud, but original and fun."
5.0,Shoes were for my girl friend. She saw them in the store and they didn't have her size. They were exactly what she wanted.
5.0,Seems to be as good as the more expensive/well known brand that my wife uses at a much lower price.  Quality is good.
5.0,"Love these socks!  They do not slip, they are no-show, and they have washed well."
5.0,"Fit? I'll have to get back to you on the fit. Not sure yet where to ... whatever. Anyway, this is an excellent product. Best I've ever used."
5.0,"Good gloves, best option for the money. I would highly recommend them"
5.0,These items was for my baby girl she want more🌹
5.0,Love these. Lightweight Terry sweats but for riding. Fit tts. So comfy.
5.0,The dress was exactly what we were looking for. The quality was excellent as well. Does not shrink after washing.
5.0,1st of all I love purple and this has turned into my every other day choose lol
5.0,"Exceeded all of my expectations. I was very hesitant about this dress because honestly the pictures do it NO justice. It looks stunning and expensive in real life. My daughter will not take it off. It flows and is comfortable for her, the material is not heavy at all. I purchased size 3-4T and my daughter just turned 4, it fit her perfectly."
5.0,Out if 200 pieces there was only one broken.  I will say these little charms are very beautiful and the price is right. I would buy them again. My 92 year old mom makes ear rings from these for gifts. She was thrilled.
5.0,"These glasses did not seem overly large at all.  They did rest on my cheeks, however, but overall, I am very pleased with these glasses."
5.0,I still have this and it's soooooo nice. Used it for bar crawls and a 5k. I was legit happy with it because it was SUPER cold and I was cozy.
5.0,"This is great for bike rides during cool fall & early spring days.  The hood actually covers my forehead to my eyebrows, so it really offers a nice amount of wind protection.  There is elastic at all of the openings to also help keep out cool air.  It comes with a thin bag to squish it up & stuff it in which is another plus.  I can hang it off of my bars, belt, or toss it in my dorky bike basket (yes I have a basket on my bike I like to carry stuff & gather stuff, being a dork is fun).<br /><br />I normally wear a size small, but like to go up a size in jackets so I have better range of motion.  I got this in a medium & it is plenty roomy, not restricting at all.  I'm wondering if a small would have actually fit fine.  That's the problem with not being able to try stuff on first.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really comfy & handy jacket to have for any occasion.  Heck, with it's storage bag, you can even keep it in your car for emergencies.  Come to think of it, I think I'll do that.  When I go for a bike ride, I'll just grab it out of the car."
5.0,"Another satisfied purchase. I ordered a small and if fits just right. Reaches just at the ankle. I'm 140 and 5'6"" and a small works for me."
5.0,"I love this tank top but there is no scenario in which could I ever do anything resembling a workout in this thing. It’s become a staple in my wardrobe  because I love the colors, and, well, I don’t have to wear a bra, but the pads are not sewn in and there is no elastic shelf, so I have to do a lot of adjusting constantly"
5.0,I bought this for my daughter's 2 year birthday party. i was shocked at how versatile it is! It not only fits her head but mine too! Also put together very nicely. Everything was intact and pretty! She could wear this as she grows
5.0,"Dope pants.  Feel good, well built.  If I had anything negative to say... the button fasten is cheaply made."
5.0,"I Love them!  First off, When I first purchased these,  I accidentally bought a size 4.5 (I'm a size 7). I emailed the company about my mistake, not really expecting a quick reply because of my experience with clothing companies in the past. Too my surprise they emailed me back within a couple of hours to tell me they changed the size and shipped the shoes.<br />Second,  they arrived earlier than I expected,  which is awesome!<br />Third,  They look and feel great!  Definitely going to keep my feet warm when it snows here."
5.0,Probably my favorite watch right now. The tone is great for most of the outfits I wear. Band and color is still clean and smooth. The face is what attracted me and it looks better in person. Plenty compliments on this one.
5.0,Colors were bright and didn't &#34; melt&#34; away because of the oil on your skin.  I work with horses and in manufacturing and I get it caught on a lot of stuff but it still hasn't broken
5.0,Great pajama outfits. I bought more
5.0,Very cute! Love it and will buy again
5.0,"Size Large in this fits perfect. For reference I am 5'5&quot;, 150 lbs., and curvy. I usually wear a U.S.A. size medium. From the reviews, the size chart measurements (very accurate) and because this is a bodycon fit, I ordered up a size. Fits me perfect. Dress delivered is better than pictured! 90% cotton and 10% spandex. Dress is lightweight but NOT see through. You can see and feel the quality. The pictures on Meaneor's product pages are accurate and very helpful! Shipped fast also."
5.0,My son loved this hat. It is good looking and well made.
5.0,This wallet is thin and great quality. Very strong magnets and all cards have kept working. Room for all the important stuff.
5.0,ver pretty
5.0,"I love these so much! I have to pull them up every now and then but they're warm, soft and make me look great! I love these!!"
5.0,"Nordstrom has the colored round for 4 times this price!  I love these, so light and pretty and perfect for summer.  They go with so much and I wear these all of the time.  Highly recommend and they come with pretty packaging."
5.0,"loved this product. got it as a gift for one of my sisters, and she just loved it and so did I. would buy again."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. The pockets are the best.
5.0,"Should have bought sooner. That's my only regret and/or complain! I did take my time to research, which is why I finally got my set, and I'm glad I picked this since it comes with so many extras. It's very well worth the price, good job FIDELO! 👍"
5.0,"Love this dress!  I'm 5'1 and it's maybe 2 inches too long on my frame, so I wear it with some heels and it's perfect.  It's super comfortable, exactly what I was looking for and with a belt, very fashionable.  I ordered another one in a different color the same day I received this one.  Fits true to size."
5.0,My daughter love  the experience of open the clam
5.0,Gave at a shower for the big sister to wear she just loved it!
5.0,Great fit... Nice price
5.0,This was the perfect Christmas present for my husband! He usually wears an XL but the large fit him perfectly! He absolutely positively loved it!! And it has a cape!!!
5.0,My neice loves this pullover. I purchased it for a Christmas gift. She loves wolves. The color is beautiful.
5.0,The contrast of colors really makes this shirt pop.  My Fiance loves it and so do I.  As a wounded warrior its great to see craftsmanship in these shirts.  I would highly recommend it.
5.0,"Great ring, fits me perfect having XL hands"
5.0,was a present and they love it thanks
5.0,For aging mother and the plastic ones are not as easy to clean and sanitize - also should not have to replace this item
5.0,So cute! Loved it!!!
5.0,"cute bracelet, perfect for anyone with nautical tastes!"
5.0,"I absolutely love these boots. They are true to size and very nice quality. I wear them walking around in New England where it’s cold, and they keep my feet warm, comfortable, and durable. I usually wear thick, higher socks as seen in the photo. The color is gorgeous, exactly like the product picture. The details are perfect, and the buckles are thick and not flimsy or cheaply made. I love that the toe area is hard and all around the boots are a thick and sturdy material so they look and feel like they are made well and will last. I 100% recommend these. The best part is, I had a dream about red rocket dog boots. I looked up that exact thing and these came up, and I knew I had to buy them! am I crazy or what lol"
5.0,"Beautiful dress!!! Fits great, soft fabric & lace, nice quality. I received a lot of compliments.  I purchased a large but could have worn a medium without any problems. I normally wear an 8. I wish the belt were adjustable."
5.0,"I can’t believe a pair of jeans I found online fit so well!! These are fitted all the way down to the ankles, but the material is very stretchy. MOST AMAZINGLY, the waist is flexible!! Normally, the jeans that fit me in the hips and booty, don’t fit in the waist. THESE DO! I ordered my normal size and they fit like a glove. LOTS of compliments!"
5.0,"I was afraid it would be too big, but with adjustable links it fits perfect.  Lovely item."
5.0,Super cute. Just like picture. You get what you pay for in which this necklace is pretty cheap but adorable
5.0,"Love this bag! Simple, great quality, perfect size. Plenty of room for shoes in the bottom compartment. Smaller pocket within main bag area is great for those smaller items that like to bury themselves in the bottom of your bag."
5.0,Perfect with leggings. Runs big but I think it's the style.
5.0,Absolutely love the earrings. I wear them all the time. I appreciate y'all sending the information on what everything means because I've now been able to explain it to my friends. I'm very happy to a found the site. Thank you so much for such a wonderful set of earrings.
5.0,Love Alex and Ani! I bought this as a gift.  I have one that I've worn for at least a year without taking it off and it still looks new.  Great quality
5.0,This dress is gorgeous.  Just the right style for a mother of the bride dress for bridesmaid luncheon.
5.0,"Love these, Esp the smallest ones. I sleep in them and have no issues. They stay on due to the neat clasp. Only thing I was a bit disappointed with was they weren't as silvery as the product picture. But I'm not that unhappy."
5.0,"Gives great shape, good materials, great price! It runs a little bit big, I ordered medium because normally is what I use, I don't like to feel tight however the medium was big, I had to order the small size and was perfect. I kept the medium for a friend, she love it!!!"
5.0,good watch for the price
5.0,Great product. Great customer servive
5.0,beautiful suit to hide my 10 COVID pounds till I can fit into my bikini again. Nice style to hide chubby upper arms. love it
5.0,Gorgeous- can't say enough about it- definitely a head turner
5.0,Cute gift. Good material. Fits well. Would buy again.
5.0,My husband's feet have been hurting w/different boots he has. Saw these & thought let's hope fur the best fur comfort. Low & behold HE SAYS THEY FEEL FANTASTIC. And no more pain..<br />Thanks so much for making comfy boots. 😉
5.0,Look so good on my seven year old daughter. Would definitely buy again.
5.0,"I've seen several terrible-quality stamped aluminum ""cap badges"" out there.  This is a beautifully-made badge that I'm proud to wear on my cap. Appears well-crafted and feels substantial in your hand. Very very pleased with the quality."
5.0,"At first I thought it was a bit large (my son was born at 5 lbs) but now that my baby has gotten to about 12 lbs, it's nice to wrap him up in it. The usual towels aren't as cozy as this one!"
5.0,Love it! Great comfortable fabric!<br />The color goes with lots of stuff.<br />Great purchase.
5.0,Pattyboutik is my favourite shop! This jumper is fitted and perfect for curves. The sleeves are very long with red and white stripes. It is very smart and classy and comfortable to wear. I am a UK 14/16 and the L fits well.
5.0,"I have had my F-91w for several years. My son also has one. You’ll see that my positive comments are similar to those of other reviewers:<br />- Comfortable and almost weightless. Feels like it’s not there.<br />- The perfect set of features for a digital watch: Time; 24-hr (military) time; optional hourly beep; optional daily alarm; stop watch w/ 1/100th of second timing; light.<br />- According to Casio, this is not really a water resistant watch— splashes only, I believe. However, my son & I have worn ours swimming in fresh water and salt water dozens of times, often for over an hour at a time. No damage at all.<br /><br />My only complaint: The light. Back when I owned my early Casios (mid-1980s), the “backlights” were dim and weak yellowish lights that shone from one side of the display and almost didn’t light up the opposite side of the display. That’s how this light is.  This weak feature might not matter to you, but I sleep in my watch and am in the habit of looking at it if I wake up at night.  The light almost doesn’t light up the whole face.  If the watch’s light is important to you, consider the Casio F-105, which is the same exact watch (size/shape/features) as the F-91w, but for $3 more gives you a blue light that illuminates the entire screen uniformly. I have another Casio watche with this type of light and it’s amazing. So if the weak light doesn’t matter, get this for $10. For a much better light, get the F-105 for $13."
5.0,"Great Bag. I was totally surprised how nice it is I bought a second one for my friend. Just beautiful! I use it daily, everthing I need fits inside."
5.0,"This dress was gorgeous and fits like a glove. Make sure you use the measurement guide in the photos, it’s very accurate. The part on the arms makes it difficult to move your arms high, but it sits perfectly for asthetics. The fabric was very nice. It’s a great dress especially for how low the price is. There is a built in bra with adjustable bra straps in the back. It’s a very good built in bra as well. I’m wearing a size 4."
5.0,I absolutely love the white fold over ones. I only trust the ones that are prime eligible.
5.0,Very nice coat. Very thick and warm. Bought it for my son but it's too small. Need to reorder 1 size up
5.0,Really good. The watch is beautiful
5.0,My dress arrived before the date.<br /> It  fits  and feels  good. It is  soft and relaxed.<br />I love it and will be buying another
5.0,I like the way the scarves feel. Awesome wrapping.
5.0,"Love these fun earring.  Planning an Caribbean trip in a few days , perfect."
5.0,"This medal is very, very lovely. Exactly as they described it. And with the price!"
5.0,This hoodie has style and quality. The material is durable and comfortable to wear. Easy to maintain and clean. Not super heavy where it feels bulky.
5.0,i just bought this because my 5 year granddaughter loved her doll.  perfect fit fit both of them
5.0,Product as described. No problem when wearing.
5.0,Used with AA chip coins.  Works Great!!!
5.0,Even prettier in person
5.0,I love this belt! It’s perfect!
5.0,I love it and it soft I bought it for myself
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! Dainty and sweet. I love the 3D effect of the necklace. Would definitely recommend!
5.0,"Beautiful earrings!!! They look amazing, even better craftsmanship and quality. Company responded unbelievable quick i was shocked! You’ll love them"
5.0,Tiny earrings but perfect for my 9 year old!
5.0,I love this.  Inside cloth for removing tarnish and outside to polish and shine.  Simple and easy to use.
5.0,Great hat! Very functional and really cute. Worked flawlessly. Spent some time in the sun and it protected my face really well.
5.0,"The shirt is made of good quality material. I've laundered it in cold water several times and air-dried it, and it hasn't shrunk. I ordered one size up from my normal size (as recommended), and it's a perfect fit."
5.0,I've been wearing these for years.
5.0,Fashionable.
5.0,Very pretty on!
5.0,I’m 5’3 and weight 190. Very curvy. I got the XXL. It fit perfect for my imperfect body. I have very big butt and hips and a little stomach but not bad. The bottoms filled and covered everything without looking like grams bathing suit. The top fit my 36/38 D perfect. I just changed out the pass for larger ones. I love that there are no strings to tie or claps to deal. It’s cute for the gym pool. Will be ordering down as I loose weight. FYI the band is thin with no drawstring. If you are built straight up and down you will not like this swimsuit. Definitely for curves. Also great for river trips or lakes. Hope this helps!
5.0,Thank you! I really liked it!
5.0,love It! Great customer service!
5.0,Groovy top
5.0,"This is my favorite I look good in it ,it's comfortable I am a big girl and was sceptable of how it would fit it fits great and I get many complements on this shirt. Great buy"
5.0,This hoodie jacket is neutral beige and goes with just about everything.  It is slightly heavier than my other hoody jackets so I wear it on chilly days.  It has the toastiest sherpa lining.  I am 5'7 and 127 lbs.  Got this in Medium.  Fits good - true to size.
5.0,Liked them just a little too long
5.0,"Very cute, good quality"
5.0,"This is a very pretty coin pendant on a chain.  The thing that attracted me to it is that its 925 silver, and most of my family cannot wear ""fake"" metals.<br /><br />The presentation box is one of the best I've seen in this price range - it looks good and it is classy.  I didn't really like how the note card and polish cloth are the first thing you see when opening the box - they kinda fall out in your lap.  So maybe if you are giving it as a gift you take those out first and put the in the bottom or give them later.  You'd also want to remove the plastic wrap (if giving in person of course!).<br /><br />The size is good for me, as my wife is petite and she would find this to be ""perfect"".  Although it does have a lot of bling in the photo, its not that bling-y in person.<br /><br />Overall this item is a home run (if you are a fan of this sort of pendant style)"
5.0,Love this dress so pretty
5.0,"I bought these to walk a trail near my home, but ended up using them to hang around the house too. And also for my physical therapy appointments.  I injured my knee in an accident and I need to have it uncovered for those appointments, but also more comfortable to have it uncovered at home.  Very comfortable stretch, long enough to feel covered, and the pocket for my phone.  Perfect!"
5.0,Bought these as a Christmas gift to my step brother. He seemed to like them. They came wrapped up in paper sleeves so it was difficult to tell the quality without removing them from the package. But from what I could tell they where super soft and felt thick. I would bet they keep your feet nice and warm.
5.0,Cutest headbands ever!!! Love this seller!!
5.0,"This was the perfect gift and it was so easy to find non of the stores nearby had pink jade and this bracelet was the exact color my gift recipient wanted in a pretty pink color. It's sturdy but looks feminine and pretty on her wrist. Once she put it on, she hasn't taken it off!"
5.0,Sunflowers is my Favorite and when I saw these I KNEW I wanted them!
5.0,Came quickly and quality met expectations.
5.0,My wife loves this unique piece of jewelry. It is a bit heavy but sturdy so the anklet won’t break.  It’s very pretty for the summer.
5.0,"Fits true to size. Pretty darn cute to wear out on a regular day of shopping, running errands, etc. quite nice on a hot summer day as the type of material kept me cool."
5.0,I have had my watch for 2 yrs now and wear it almost everyday. When I bought it I bought a black stainless steel band for it and it has held up quite well with minimal signs of wear on the band. I just had to rebuild the watch recently starting with replacing the battery a few months ago and replacing the display/ case because it had black spot. So I wanted to give it the watch a make over. The band looks great on the watch and my wrist though the lock wings are easy to bump and have the watch come loose on your wrist sometimes. I would still recommend it just be cautious. Now the bezel that came with it looks OK but not really my style. The numbers are really fat and it does't look good for me.  Everyone has their preference. So I bought one that has a black diamond look to it. Works for me.
5.0,I got them for my husband and he loves them
5.0,This bathing suit is adorable.  It is not for sluts though.  I'm a wholesome transgender who is not a slut.  I approve of this article of swim wear.
5.0,bigger than I thought but fits everything Whoo! Gonna get the matching bag!
5.0,Excellent product and service. Fast shipping
5.0,Love the side pocket. Makes it easier to run with your phone as opposed to having it in your shorts pocket.
5.0,Fits a lot and love that there is a zipper! I read that some bags that fold like this don’t have a zipper. Well made!
5.0,A mi hijo le gustaron mucho buena variedad y calidad
5.0,"The fit is nice, they look nice and are warm besides!"
5.0,So beautiful and just what I was looking for! Not too big.
5.0,"This dress is drop dead gorgeous!  However, it is sized very small.  I typically wear a size 6, ordered 8-10, and could not even get it zipped up the back.  Reorded a 14.  But so so pretty."
5.0,The necklace is beautiful! Everyone comments on it. Perfect size and color. Love the mom on the side. I think of it that my boys are always close to my heart.
5.0,The necklace is very beautiful! The intricate details are amazing. The chain is beautiful and dainty as well. It is going to make a perfect gift for that special someone in your life!
5.0,Would like more of the same they are very comfortable.
5.0,Nice skirt and quality material but if you have big hips it may not fit properly.
5.0,"We have many kinds of masks, this is my favorite (average size woman face). It fits around my face well enough that my glasses do not fog up. It has a filter pocket in addition to the cloth layers. I can talk in them without it moving around my face or slipping down."
5.0,My son wanted these to gift his friends sort of like friendship bracelets and they love them
5.0,I needed a sturdy and functional key holder. It arrived in a beautiful gift box and I love the Idakey. This is my second purchase and I won't hesitate to get another when I need one.
5.0,Perfect fit! Not too short
5.0,"So cute!  The gray is kind of a brownish-smoky gray, not a true gray, and the red is similarly muted, but honestly that makes them even better.  They are soft and stay up well, the ears stay up nicely.  The white spots on the socks are done with colorwork, and the ends of each section are loose and fuzzy on the inside of the sock, kind of like thrumming, providing extra insulation, softness, and warmth.<br /><br />My kids are nearly 6 and almost 7, pretty tall and skinny types, and they both have the option of wearing these a little slouchy under the knee or snug right over the knee.  They're great for wearing with skirts and dresses and shorts, obviously, but we have also put them over leggings and under-the-knee with capris.<br /><br />My only concern is durability.  I have washing these in cold water, re-shaping them and air-drying, just in case, but honestly they seem pretty rugged.  I guess we'll see!"
5.0,"Love love love this scrunchie watch band! I’ve had such a difficult task finding a good band that I don’t break out from, but I can sanitize and is comfortable and holds up, this is it! It’s cute, comfortable, stylish, and since it’s a softer vinyl type fabric, it repels liquids. I loved mine so much, I turned around and ordered another for my mother and my niece. Word of advice, they don’t run the same as basic bands though, if your wrist is a bit bigger, order the Larger band, I ordered a large for my mom as she has had surgery and has a plate in her wrist. I promise these won’t disappoint."
5.0,I needed this because I have a job that I can be anywhere at any time.<br /><br />It comes in handy and I can have it in my bag.
5.0,Great quality and speedy shipping!
5.0,Size is good (some socks say they fit specific shoe size and the they are tight or stretched-these are just right). Very comfortable! Highly recommend them!
5.0,This is one of my favorite dresses. Fits great and color is amazing. Only complaint is that shirt wrinkles very badly.
5.0,"This sunglass fits my head perfectly.  It is a little wider than most frames, and the arms on the frame are flexible.  This frame is wide enough for a more rounded facial feature head.  Plus, the cost of this sunglass is cheap.  I would highly recommend."
5.0,Absolutely perfect!! ❤️
5.0,Nothing fancy here and that is exactly what is needed. We use these for our daughters for Volleyball and Softball as they both have very long hair and need it to stay out of their faces. These tie back so they fit various size heads and they stay in place decently well for this type of product. Would purchase again.
5.0,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
5.0,They were in excellent condition.
5.0,"We used this at an Easter event at our local elementary school and the KIDS LOVED IT!<br />It's a well made thin plastic suit which you get into and zip up in the back (from the outside, so you need a helper). It uses four AA batteries to power a fan which inflates the suit once you are in it. The 3 inch fan is the only ventilation though, so it can get hot inside the suit especially if you are in the sun!<br />The suit was a hit - we will definitely be using it again next year!"
5.0,It's a nice quality bug tie that depicts great pictures.
5.0,i gave this to my wife a year ago and she still use it. great product.
5.0,Look it it fit perfect
5.0,"Love love love this dress, I'm 3 weeks post partum so I went on a mission on finding cute comfy dresses, plus is over 90' where I live right now so I also needed something light, and this dress it's a winner, got lots of compliments already, I will definitely purchase more colors"
5.0,"Very fun Halloween ring, much nicer than the plain plastic ones you can buy at party shops. A little bigger than I was expecting, but it's still comfortable enough to wear."
5.0,Colors are much more beautiful in person!  Great length and nice and warm!
5.0,Has tons of pockets and compartments and several insulated sleeves for bottles. I like that it doesn’t look like a diaper bag and my boyfriend can carry it if needed.
5.0,"I am  42/36/42 and went with a 2xl because usually these kind of dresses fit on the tight side and I was in between sizes on their size chart.  If I order it again, Ill probably try a Large, it fits gigantic.  I ordered it for a Belle costume so with the apron and the shirt under it, it is not horrible, but definitely don't size up if you are between sizes.<br /><br />The fabric is a really comfortable stretch, it is not thin at all! The pockets are full size pockets too."
5.0,Look great and we're easy to swap out. The only thing is I feel like they come out a little too easily.
5.0,"Been wearing these shirts for years; that says it all. They will require touch-up ironing, but then I’ve never seen a true wrinkle-free shirt that included cotton. The stain repellant finish really works; plus bead up on material instead of soaking in. Not made in US; but at least it isn’t China."
5.0,This looks gorgeous
5.0,"I love it!! I get comments all day when I wear it. I got a medium instead of my usual small. It is slightly too big, but I don’t think anyone notices. So I would say the shirts are true to size unless your ta tas are exceptionally large (congrats btw) I wouldn’t go up a size."
5.0,I had to return this item because it didn’t fit :/ it was too big but the feel of it and the fabric was great! It came with a nice belt also.
5.0,"Great color and fit, though these are definitely SKINNY pants, not slim-fit. I am a slender person and I was looking for this, but someone with a more muscular build may have difficulties getting your legs through the pants. If you're looking for merely slim-fit trousers, you should look elsewhere. These are quite snug even on my slim build."
5.0,Great addition to any vacation on the water.......
5.0,Shirt fit perfect. True to size
5.0,"This mask is a good quality mask that looks awesome. The latex material is very thick. It's not flimsy like other masks I have purchased. It has some foam placement inside on the top to help the fit while wearing, The only negative I can say about it is that it is very hard to see out of while wearing. I had to tilt the mask downward to see out of the vision holes."
5.0,"Love this top! The size 6 fits like a loose 5x. But it's cotton, so it will shrink. The colors are very vibrant."
5.0,"Bought this dress for a wedding in September. I needed something that wouldn't be too hot. I can tell this dress will be perfect. It's super comfortable and fits really well. It's a little big, but I feel like if I went down a size it would have been tighter than I'd want, and I don't mind a little give so my fat doesn't show lol. I got the burgundy in size large."
5.0,"This dress will make you look like you deserve all the awards. The sequins are rounded, so they won't scratch your skin. The dress is fully lined. The back neckline has a slight cowl. The fabric has no stretch. I found the fit to run small. For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier."
5.0,Looks very nice and stylish.
5.0,Gorgeous in one word.
5.0,Son unas gafas excelentes pero lo que no me gusto es el estuche con lo que lo acompañaba.
5.0,good bath robe. soft and natural
5.0,"Cute dress. Fit me well. 5'2&#34;. 34B. 147 lbs. Im not too curvy. Wear a 10 in dresses so took the risk and ordered a 10. Its stretchy so it hugged on the curves (hips). Back has a small hook, but this dress does not have a metal hook for it, its just thread. That's fine. Still holds and looks amazing!"
5.0,Just perfect I bought 3 !!! And love them all !!!
5.0,I bought them for my husband for the second time. I bought him another brand but he insisted on  these glasses. He says it works the best for him. He can see better with them even when he’s not on the computer. Thank you. I’ll be ordering them again when he sits on them. LOL
5.0,Keep my feet warm.
5.0,Great bracelet and very well made
5.0,These are lovely earrings that look comparable to the real thing made by ODLR. Except these are far cheaper but still well made. Love em!
5.0,"Great price, great product"
5.0,"This is  very cute bikini I would definitely recommend it! I ordered it in the leopard and in the red, White, and blue stars and stripes style. I am 5’8 135lbs with an athletic build size 34C. In all of my workout tights, tops, shorts etc. (under armor, Reebok, adidas) I wear a size small. I ordered a size LARGE in this suit and I am glad that I did! I would normally buy a size medium swimsuit at a department store.<br />The bottoms fit PERFECT in the size Large! The top is slightly larger then I would like in the band around the bottom but it fits. Excited to wear these two suits to the beach next week!"
5.0,I love that they are made of wood and are very light weight. I love that they are light weight and not tiny .
5.0,Beautiful gift.
5.0,"Exactly as advertised, great deal."
5.0,These goggles are the truth. I was looking for something sturdy to wear for work and these have come in handy for sure. They are built to last. Would definitely purchase again.
5.0,"Fit true to size, loved the quality of the shirt and color."
5.0,"Great product. Works perfectly at night and day, especially when it comes to glare."
5.0,She is small and it fit perfectly
5.0,Fit perfectly and exactly like the photo!
5.0,"Need to wear under a mesh hat to protect from sun damage to head. Works perfectly, fits great."
5.0,"Great product for the price, and it arrived in the mail fairly quickly."
5.0,"These are really great. I surf, sail, kayak,,,you name it. They are really good and they float."
5.0,Unbelievably good !
5.0,great product thanks
5.0,"I’m 5’6” 175lbs and ordered a M. I got nervous as I was putting this on as it seemed a bit snug, but after putting it all the way on, I realized that was only because of the “slimming” affect of the swimsuit. This is my favorite swimsuit I’ve ever had! It is comfortable, has a beautiful cut, adjustable straps, padding in the breast, and most importantly; it slims without leaving that sharp, unflattering indentation on the butt area! I would love to buy another color. Don’t hesitate to buy, you’ll love it!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:41ec79c3d99f32d0806b50f95c0b6922]] These are very very beautiful I will be buying another pair
5.0,Socks fit as expected.  They are thick and look durable.  Bright orange is also really cheerful.
5.0,Perfect all around gift for your flower girl.
5.0,"I love this gorgeous silky top. The fabric absorbs perspiration and dries quickly, so it has a cooling effect, even with the long fitted sleeves (which protect against sun damage--SPF 50.)  I wore it walking, and tossed it in the machine when we got home (cold/delicate). The color didn't fade or run. It's everything I want in an all-season top."
5.0,"Awesome. Busted the clasp on my original bands so ordered these. Arrived fast, shiny and with extra pins! If i need more bands I will buy from them again."
5.0,"Love it Love it Love it. Beautiful and well made. Fit perfectly as well. Thank you, will buy again!"
5.0,Very nice wallet. The card slots are a little tight at first but once you break it in its perfect.
5.0,A colorful way to hold all my favorite pens!
5.0,Very comfortable soft and look great
5.0,This is a great inexpensive watch.  It is simple enough for a 10 year old to use.

5.0,"Purchased this is the black and white stripe and I love it.  I am wearing it as I type this review with leggings at work.  Washed well on the delicate cycle. I let it air dry.  Length is perfect with leggings...I am 5"" 7"".  XL fit perfectly - I am normally a 14-16 in a top.  Just ordered it in black...would recommend to anyone!"
5.0,"Just as I needed, racer back tanks tops that are lightweight, comfortable and dry fit. Oh, and not to mention - AFFORDABLE!!! Great purchase indeed."
5.0,I love the fit and look of this dress. Had to get it hemmed due to I'm small .
5.0,"The mask is large, comfortable, adjustable and allows one to both breathe and speak easily."
5.0,The boots are great quality just like real boots. There isn't much space after they are on but. They are very nice

5.0,This is my second Escape Miracle suit. My last suit looked great for years !
5.0,Great product for a good professional look.
5.0,The umbrella  was as advertised when I received it.  The material was heavier than the one it replaced and it was well made. It was easy to assemble and set up and I really like the ability to rotate it  as the sun changes position.
5.0,Really cute bag
5.0,In one beautifull watch
5.0,Great quality. This product is as it apppears in the photo. I love it!
5.0,Gave as a gift to a rapper!! They loved it!!
5.0,Not real tight compression but you should lose the gut working out and eating better. It’s more like a tight support wear which I like.
5.0,A Christmas gift for my sister. I know she is going to love this. It's super cute and elegant at the same time. Any Tweety Bird fan will love this. :).
5.0,These look very refined.
5.0,"I absolutely love this Skort!! Bought same style in (turquoise?) 2 colors; another w/ pleats, & a print without wrap in front; have 4 PRINCE skorts now.

Mostly only wear these 4 skorts"
5.0,"The stone is a white cat's eye moonstone, which I like even better had it been pink. It fits well and is a lovely, elegant ring."
5.0,"This purse is my favorite right now. I saw a similar style at a different store for much more and decided to look on amazon instead, I'm obsessed. Too cute! Such a stylish accessory for your outfit and I'm excited to also wear it on Valentine's Day!"

5.0,"I bought these as a gift for my husband. He says they fit great but I notice that he cannot pull them all the way up and must wear them scrunched at his ankles (he has larger ankles, but not abnormally so). He LOVES these socks and has asked for more! I think they are his favorite of all his gifts!"
5.0,"Nice size, I use when I pray."
5.0,"Yes, fit very good"
5.0,"I ordered mine and came out perfect for me (6'2"" and 185#). Timely delivery and the pants looks great; have received comments on how good they look."
5.0,AKA stress relievers in disguise. Nicely hand made and painted.
5.0,really love this piece....I pair it with a pair of faded blue jeans and a coloured tank top or a pair of shorts and a white cami.  It's a nice way to cover your shoulders without wearing a sweater or a jacket when it's 110 degrees!
5.0,"I was worried about how the hat would look since I have a big head. It looked great, not too small for my head"
5.0,"I have used this glove to work on many meat carving and deboning projects through the Holiday Season. I feel much more safe wearing this glove, I have yet to test it hard, but I know it works well on the lite impacts that would normally cause food waste, or medical attention..!!"
5.0,Bought several for Christmas presents and they love them !
5.0,I like the color the disign but only think is that the design in the waist it was a little up from my waist
5.0,Very beautiful! As shown.
5.0,"Very Warm - these are very nice, thick socks and so warm!!"
5.0,"really cute, look great on me"
5.0,Love these shorts. Went with reviews and got a size medium. Usually a size small. Glad I sized up!

5.0,This was a gift for my sister in law. She really liked it and my brother said it was beautiful.
5.0,It is true to size I was just hoping it would fit it's for a Halloween costume and she wanted a dress instead of overhauls.
5.0,My daughter wanted to get her cartilage pierced but we feel she is too young.  This is a great alternative to piecing her cartilage.  She loves them.
5.0,"Great for my spinning class- I almost wish I had bought a larger size, isn’t tight but wouldn’t mind extra room"
5.0,I got the black one to use for work.<br />It is not revealing. It maintains a clean shape. It is soft and warm.<br />Everything a sweater should be.
5.0,Love this hat.  I will war it for many summers to come.
5.0,This dress fit well and I got so many compliments. I wish it didn't wrinkle because i took it on a trip and it was really hard to pull out the wrinkles. I think I would buy the next size down next time I buy a different color.
5.0,perfection! it's not easy to find things that fit well and look good if you're not a size 0!!! i wish I'd bought more than 1 and plan to do so very soon.
5.0,I love the soft insole and bottom sole.  I don't like to make a lot of noise when I walk so this was perfect for me.  I can't stand anything except twill tape or soft leather between my toes and these fit the bill perfectly for me.
5.0,"Stays put, great color, super absorbent!"
5.0,I was very happy with this purchase and it is a great value. I would highly recommend this product to my friends.
5.0,It is a bit in the small side and the strap is not very long but I live this little purse.
5.0,"Quality garment, great fit with room to move. I'm really pleased with my purchase.  I love garments that cover but are still stylish.  It's shorter in the back and longer in the front and I would have preferred the length in the back and the front. But I can live with the length in the back which reaches just just a little short of full coverage of my bottom..But this is not a problem but just the way it was designed,  it's just my personal preference to have more length at the back. I'm 5ft 5 in so kinda average height. So on a shorter person it would fall lower in the back. If it were longer in the back I would have ordered several more colors."
5.0,So nice!
5.0,Nostalgic. My grown kids want some. Everybody wants to know where I got them. Wish I sold them.
5.0,"I ordered this item with a one day shipping for my daughter's junior prom. It arrived on time, and it is gorgeous. It is perfect since my daughter has a very small wrist, and this bangle is fully adjustable. Very happy with the purchase."
5.0,These shoes are great for my 14 month old. They go on easy and fit perfectly.
5.0,"Bought this for my grandson, he was thrilled with it. Thank you for making sure I got it in time for Christmas."
5.0,Super Fun and super sparkly. The Pictures don't do these earring justice. Many complements . Highly recommend getting these .
5.0,I bought large. I put them in dryer on high heat and they shrunk. Nice material. Vibrant coliurs. Soft. However be extra careful separating pack if underwear from plastic tag. I normally am careful. I noticed holes where i pulled the tag out. Had to sew area with matching thread. Poop🙁
5.0,I bought it for my daughter and she loved it
5.0,"Very pretty. Great material, super comfortable."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.
5.0,Everything lots of compliments fits very nice

5.0,I ordered 4 different bracelets from this company & love them all. Was pleasantly surprised of how beautiful the bracelet appeared. Excellent quality. Will order more.
5.0,Complete blindness can't see a thing as supposed to be. Mouth opening is a bit too small so just cut it a bit larger and everything is perfect.
5.0,Very nice set. Keeps you warm
5.0,A little short so it eventually broke when it sagged on something.
5.0,I found these earrings to be uniquely cool.<br />The different texture and mixed metals were nice.<br />They are very small and light.
5.0,"I have had these earrings for almost a year now.  I have two pairs of the 3mm and one pair of the 6mm.  Over 10 months of regular wearing, being tossed into my jewelry bag, and traveling around, these earrings are still perfectly intact and gorgeous!  It looks like I just bought them.  The only tarnish that has happened was a little bit on the post that goes into your ear.  However, this is completely unnoticeable from the outside and has caused me no irritation.  I can leave these in for days with no discoloration or itchiness.  The backers are also sturdy and I actually find myself using them for other earrings too when I'm not using them for these.  I get so many compliments on how they catch the light - the colors are lovely.  10/10 would buy again."
5.0,These are thick and nice.
5.0,I really like this hat.. High in fashion and functionality.  It has a lining that adds to it's warmth. Great fit and comfortable.

5.0,My 7 year old has worn this cap numerous times and it has stood up to multiple washing a with no damage to image.

5.0,Great product! Well made! Fast Shipping!
5.0,"This dress is really high quality! It has hidden pockets and is lined making for a comfortable fit. I had to sew belt loops due to the belt moving around. I'd agree with other reviewers that buy a size up to make sure things aren't too tight up top. Overall, a great dress!"
5.0,these shirts are so cute and stylish my daughter wanted these shirts in different colors to wear with her skinny jeans true to size great christmas gift
5.0,"Got it in XS for the mrs, and it fits her as a comfortable silky pajama."
5.0,Very cute and so far so good
5.0,super silky and soft
5.0,I bought this for my daughter wolf costume. She loves it and thy fit perfectly. Great job I will buy again.
5.0,Perfect time piece stylish and easily adjusted watch band! Lasts how long??? what else can you ask for?
5.0,"I just ordered my second pack of these. As a person who likes to dance a lot, but struggles with sweat in his eyes after only a few songs, these are a must. I mean, I use them for running and biking and working out too, but most of my use occurs on the dance floor. They are very absorbent, don't fall apart in the washer/dryer, and I never leave home without at least one. I've received numerous compliments on my headbands, and I don't even wear them for their obvious high fashion--I wear them for the utility."
5.0,"These are gorgeous earrings!  The silver work is detailed and unusual, and the stone is just beautiful.  Very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,I love this top. It’s so comfortable and can be casual or dressed up. I even bought a second color
5.0,Fits well and very comfortable.
5.0,Easy breezy
5.0,"This ID card case with lanyard is attractive, and not cheap looking for the price!"
5.0,Great value and color options. I wear these regularly and love them.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:a4250238e66c810ae7201b15bcb952d8]] I am very happy with this purchase!<br />It seems well-made and looks like it will hold up well. Plus, it came in a cute little bag.<br />It will make the perfect gift!"
5.0,My favorite pajamas!
5.0,"Was a gift for my best friend, she loved it!  Great value, price, and exceptionally packaged.  Thank you!"
5.0,cheap watch does what it supposed to tell time light works good at night has long enough strap to fastenthree or four holes in from end making more secure on wrist  iam hard on watches
5.0,I love this key ring. It a simple present that my son gave me.
5.0,used to make my bridal bouquet!
5.0,"The color is very pretty and just like the picture. The fake dials are kind of silly, but I just ignore them. I just enjoy having these type of watches in almost every color I can get to match my outfits. So I think of them more in terms of jewelry. However the watch does function properly and I do use it for telling time as well."
5.0,Would like to tell everyone that buys these there is a protective plastic piece on the front of the lenses and one on the back when you get these in the mail. Be sure to remove these are you will think the glasses are just started and they are not. These for the price are very nice reading glasses.
5.0,I bought these as school shoes for my 6 year old boy... they haven't given him any problems even since the first day. They look nice and seem to be holding up very well after a week of wear.
5.0,"Best dress everrrr. The black and white is so elegant, classy, and sexy. I got many compliments and ordered another for friend as well. Totally recommended."
5.0,"Purchased masks for comfort,lightweight & excellent value for money. Highly recommend this product. Purchased as a gift . Masks are beautiful & extremely colorful masks."
5.0,Helmet color matches the motorcycle!  The helmet is a great fit (small). The wife liked mine so I got her helmet in the wine color.  We chose the open face because of the heat in Arizona. The visor is a great plus.
5.0,"They are a good deal. Thin, but no holes coming through yet. Recommend these!"
5.0,"The fabric is thinner than I expected, but it isn't see-through. The style is very flattering. It will be the perfect dress for Valentine's Day!"
5.0,"For Christians these are very appropriate Tallits. They are of acceptable quality, especially for the price. We have ordered many different Tallits and are very pleased with these."
5.0,"These earrings are small, cute and comfortable enough to sleep in. They are also fairly easy to close, which is not always the case with tiny hoops. Just what I was looking for."
5.0,It looks just like the photo and is good quality!
5.0,I absolutely love this scarf.
5.0,I love it! It's very soft... Like Lularoe fabric.
5.0,"Nice purse, great price."
5.0,Best wallet of my life hands down. I'll order the same wallet over and over if this one ends up getting tattered. Surprisingly durable and great quality. Tons of little pockets!<br /><br />Wrote this in 2018<br />It's now 2021 and I'm still rocking this wallet! Extremely durable still looks new!
5.0,Just wish it wouldn't take so long in shipping.  But worth the wait.  It is somewhat thin fabric (not see through).  Very light and well made.  I will probably be getting the other colors as well.
5.0,Love the socks and made my legs feel better
5.0,These come in a variety of colors and Shakes you can't get anything anywhere like it
5.0,Great gym shirt!
5.0,Fits tight but that's the purpose.
5.0,I bought this for family pictures. It is adorable! I bought her normal size and it fits just perfectly. It also washed well. Very pleased!
5.0,MEGA LIKE IT!!!MEGA LOVE IT!!!
5.0,Perfect and affordable. My husband lost his first one a week after our wedding.
5.0,Glad I looked at the reviews. The dress is more of a red and blue.
5.0,"Gave these to my husband for Christmas, and I swear if he could he would wear them to bed!!<br />I catch him walking the dog in them..getting ready to go to church in them..Really?!<br />I am thinking to purchase them in a shoe..<br />Thanks Amazon!!"
5.0,Can't wait for next seasons colors.
5.0,Looks good. I have 4 screws in my license so I had to drill 2 more holes in it. You can use 2 screws if you want.
5.0,I adore these hoops!  Perfect for every occasion!  Love them!
5.0,"So comfortable. Fits perfectly. Love the open ""holes"" that helps give air to your wrist. Highly recommend."
5.0,"I love these pants. They fit perfectly and they are so warm and cozy. For a person who's always freezing, these are great!"
5.0,"This is a beautiful bracelet. Its so classy and rich looking. I love the look that it has the cz's all the way around, which is hard to find and when it moves around, you will always see the sparkle.  I love it."
5.0,I love the quality and size- very happy with my purchase.
5.0,Love the color!  Beautiful cuff!
5.0,A great kit for when you are traveling somewhere! Kept everything really organized!  I received this with a discount coupon for a review but all of my opinions are my own
5.0,This whole set is boxed beautifully and the necklace is just stunning. The craftsmanship is beautiful and the necklace doesn't feel heavy or bulky at all.
5.0,The fabric is great. Comes out of dryer ready to wear. Fit is perfect
5.0,It's the real thing. Matches what you buy in the boutiques.
5.0,Beautiful ring and excellent price. Shipping takes quite a while but worth it!
5.0,"Beautiful dress.  We ordered 6 of these for flower girl dresses.  The girls all fit into the dresses as expected.  They looked adorable and were comfortable as they did what 5-10 yr old girls do at parties.  It says dry clean only, but I washed my daughters dress after the wedding in cold water and dried flat.  It looks perfect.  It’s ready to wear again to church or another dressy occasion."
5.0,"I really like it! I bought it to replace the &#34;Titanium EDC Minimalist&#34; that I hd just purchased; which was good, just not for me because of an old hand injury."
5.0,I love that they have a clip in the back so my son can put on his own googles for once! We have not used them yet though so I am unsure of how effective they are at keeping water out.
5.0,"Love the dress. It was a little bit longer than I expected, but I’ll get it taken up and it will be fine."
5.0,"I really hesitated at buying these boots, considering the steep price tag.  But I finally splurged, and I'm so glad I did.  These look amazing!  And thank god, the buckle is functional because I have pretty hefty ankles/calves.  Really lovely and very comfy.<br /><br />I loved them so much that I ordered them in another color."
5.0,Out of all the dresses I purchased during prime days this was the best one.  Very flattering and wearable to the office. Only complaint is the olive colored one I ordered looked more of a brown than the green shown in the picture.
5.0,"I just love my eyeglasses, they are so light."
5.0,Perfect for Ren Fest. Very comfortable and fits nicely. I ordered a large - I'm 5' 8&#34; 160#.
5.0,"This is a nice set. They are as pictured. Color is accurate. You need a belt or something to be able to wear the tail. I don't know that anything different could have been done but it would have been nice if a belt wasn't required. Either way, I still loved it and they looked great. I would recommend them."
5.0,They are the best! Very soft and comfortable
5.0,Fit true to size very soft material
5.0,absolutely cute and comfortable. this is a must have for the wardrobe.
5.0,she loves them!

5.0,"Bought these for my very particular athlete son. Finally found something that he really likes, and they hold up well."
5.0,Very comfy. Fit as expected. I’d like to buy more.
5.0,Love the dress!
5.0,Awesome fits perfect
5.0,Good price fast shipping will by again when needed.
5.0,"I'm 5'9&#34; and had a very hard time finding a maxi dress that wasn't awkwardly short on me. This one is perfect! It sits about 1 inch off the floor so it is perfect for flats or sandals. I purchased a large in the navy blue pattern. It also has pockets, which I loved!<br />For sizing references, I am 5'9&#34; and approx 200lbs (Size 14/16). I purchased both a large and xlarge to try on. Both are very flowy on the bottom half. The large fit better on my frame but if you have a larger bust, you might want to get the xlarge."
5.0,I love it. I wore it to a wedding reception and I received so many compliments...I changed it up a bit and wore the shirt the opposite way of how you're suppose to wear it!!
5.0,"the fact that it's tight, helps getting the card out easily since it's not already deep down."
5.0,Isn’t the biggest backpack if that’s what you’re looking for but for any PlayStation fan it’s a must have!
5.0,"Damn. It is very nice.  navy blue.<br />Soft feel, looks a lot better than the picture<br />for 15 bucks? It's a bargain"
5.0,"Great material! Wore this dress to a gala, felt very beautiful in it."
5.0,Just Beautiful
5.0,Kids love them. They’re safe.
5.0,This is a really nice dress the fabric is extremely comfortable. I’m pregnant and this dress made me have freedom around my belly as well as a cute cut right between my belly and chest.
5.0,Yours deserves this
5.0,This product is stunningly beautiful.  My daughter thought that this was the coolest necklace ever.
5.0,Makes the proper statement.
5.0,It is very attractive both on the hanger and me
5.0,This was a perfect fit and true to size. Very comfy
5.0,Thought it be a lil too small and kind of not as pretty as it is. It's absolutely gorgeous!
5.0,I absolutely love these dresses!! I just ordered a THIRD one in less than a month's time! I've gotten SO many compliments on them too! The material is thin but not see-through (perfect for Arizona summers). For me- 36D bra (probably could use a new fitting too) the top was a bit tight but it still looks lovely! I was surprised with the length (a bit short for me) but I've grown to love it. Definitely don't dry these in the dryer- I made that mistake!
5.0,"I truely love these boots and the price was great.  Well made also.  I usually wear a 6 but went up to a 6.5, so I can wear heavy socks in the Winter."
5.0,Super cute. Wore it to a boat party over my swim suit
5.0,I love this wallet
5.0,My granddaughter loved the Shierff Kallie boots
5.0,A person who is definitely not me LOVES these
5.0,"I wouldn't normally pay so  much for a scarf, but this is worth it if you like scarves. Packaged well and they included extra bonuses (bracelet and cloth carrying bag) that I didn't expect. The cloth is very uniform (no bulges in the threads and no gaps in the weave) and overall feels soft and light. It is also very large, so getting the look as shown in the pictures is easy.<br /><br />[...]"
5.0,"For the price and quality, I give it a five. Looks like the picture, not the best quality.. But under 20 bucks it's def worth it. fits well, at my height of 5'2 and slim build of about a hundred pounds, it drops just about on the floor."
5.0,They look great really light weight too!! Only one I wish had a clearer image is the ships but still usable.
5.0,"Feels great looks great! I’m 5,5 130 pounds, very small chest and the MEDIUM fits great. The only thing is the bottom could be a little more high waisted for me, it barely covers my belly button."
5.0,"I really like both of these tops, I’m actually waiting for the yellow and black combo to be in stock so I can order them. The open back is super sexy, only complaint is it’s a little loser then I was hoping in the back. The fabric was soft and the colors were true to the picture. For reference I’m 5’4 and 220lb in Weight loss mode. Which means in like a couple week these tops will really look amazing. I’m also super excited they match the pants I bought."
5.0,"Fantastic poncho. It hangs well and definitely kept us dry.<br /><br />I can’t tell you how many poncho reviews I read, how many I researched before buying this. I bought this and another one. While the other had a bit more found on in color/style attempt, this one worked and hung on us much better.<br /><br />Ponchos are nice especially considering rain rarely just falls straight down. Umbrellas keep your head dry but your clothes (and bags and purses) get wet more often than not, and are especially helpful when having to do some walking in the rain (as we did).<br />It’s good to have around in your car, emergency kits, etc.<br /><br />This (Green) works for any gender and is a good quality color and material (even for someone who isn’t particularly drawn to green normally).  It folds up into a provided bag for convenience. It’s good for keeping the wet poncho contained so  you can shove it into a purse or bag until you head back out in the rain. (Just be sure to open and dry it out at some point!)<br /><br />I plan to buy more to have on hand.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
5.0,I like everything about it!
5.0,They are very lightweight and I love the quality! They are great and the design on them is vibrant and colorful!!
5.0,Very light weight and comfortable.
5.0,Great set of earrings nicely made
5.0,It’s a great watch for the price. Really good for men with large wrist. Gives a very classy appearance. Loves the price as I love to change watches and this way didn’t have to invest much
5.0,"This dress is just lovely. It not only fits me PERFECT but it's so bright and vibrant. I love tye dye anything so ofcourse I love this but it is absolutely comfortable, worth the price, and you will not be disappointed if purchased! I wear a size small typically in gowns, and dresses and that is the size I got. Fits perfect with a little room."
5.0,"I am THRILLED!!!! They just came and i tried them on! I love them so much! The packaging was amazing done with such care and i received a little pouch bag to carry them in. I had a pair of white sunglasses that brought the memory of my daughter to me,. She wore white sunglasses and they broke, so did my heart.. Now since i cannot go out to try any on because of COVID-19.. My anxiety was flying,these mean so much to me i just ordered another pair.<br />THANKYOU, for great service"
5.0,"This is my review of Copper Fit Knee High Compression Socks<br /><br />I recently went through some procedures to remove a couple of bulging veins from my legs (from the knee down). Everything went fine; however, for a couple of weeks your legs and feet tend to swell up a bit.<br /><br />I have had some bad experiences with other compression sock, but I thought that I would give these a try. Bottom line, I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />They controlled the swelling, and my legs felt fine; even after wearing them all day.<br /><br />If you are in the market for knee-high compression socks, I can highly recommend this brand."
5.0,"I had to shop for a wedding last minute and wanted something simple but elegant. I decided last minute to try this dress in this color (emerald green) and it was the best decision. I received compliments all night on the dress and I was able to easily accessorize to spruce it up. The material of the dress made it perfect for the fluctuating temperatures. I wore when the weather ranged in the high 40s to low 70s in the few hour time frame. I could’ve used a jacked at the coldest but it wasn’t too bad. The material was nice, excellent stretch, and the size chart was accurate for me. I purchased a medium and I am 5’5 165 and curvy on my lower half. I felt amazing in this dress and it was a steal for the price."
5.0,"Comfortable, durable, and flexible"
5.0,Have had these for several months now.  They have held up to weekly washings and have kept their shape.
5.0,"Rugged slippers, Worn them inside and outside for a couple of months now with no signs of wear so far!"
5.0,Super soft and stretchy
5.0,Quality Material. Embroidered not decal
5.0,Purchased for my niece for her birthday. She loves it!
5.0,FITS GREAT LOOKS GOOD MY GBABY LOOOOK SO GORGGGG N THIS
5.0,Arrived exactly as pictured
5.0,"I bought this and was pleasantly surprised! I've bought several things online and while cute, they didn't fit me the right way. This was soft, flattering, and comfortable! The cut is nice, too, but a bit short on the sides to be for work. Great for a warm day out."
5.0,Fits as expected. My kid loves the sweater and wears it all the time.
5.0,This sweater is very true to size & is exactly like the picture.
5.0,Love it! This is dress is perfect! Ladies look at the size chart is pretty accurate. I am a size M and order a large one thinking it was going to run small but no it was actually a big on me but nothing that a waist belt couldn’t fix. Highly recommend this dress
5.0,My husband loved this so much as Christmas gift because he hasn't ever found a Grateful Dead jacket before. He wears all the time in winter and it's been durable and he continues to love it.
5.0,Really nice wallet.  Better materials and finish than I expected for the price.
5.0,As Undertaker was one of my favorite wrestlers I looked in depth for the right shirt as a symbol of his career. When I discovered this it said what I wanted so credit Amazon for carrying it and of course the delivery time was prompt. Shirt fits well and feels good. WWE products seem to be of good quality!
5.0,I love them.  The intricate designs in the bracelets is amazing!
5.0,My boyfriend and I love it! I ordered a size up from what I would normally wear and it fits perfect.
5.0,I'm about halfway between a medium and a large. Out of the bag the large size shirt fits me perfectly. Hope it doesn't shrink in the wash.<br /><br />Logo is as pictured and appears like it will weather washes.
5.0,I wore this dress for a 4th of July themed wedding. I got compliments on it and I loved it. I'm thankful it fit as expected because I was supposed to get it on Thursday the day before the wedding but it didn't get delivered until Friday about an hour before the wedding. I would recommend this dress!
5.0,"The shirt arrived 4 days early.  So happy to have this early.  The shirt is exactly as advertised.  The color is vibrant, the material is light weight which is exactly what I wanted.  The size is very accurate.  If you want it loose go up a size but I am completely satisfied with the size.  Very happy with this and will buy from this seller again."
5.0,our baby is huge. but it fits him.
5.0,My son likes these glove very much.
5.0,"It was a very nice surprise for the money. The set is very elegant, good quality, and very sparkling. The packaging looks like an expensive present. I am very happy with this purchase. I would recommend and buy again."
5.0,Great Product 👍👍👍👍👍👍
5.0,Very well made. Love it!!
5.0,This swim dress fits amazing and very comfortable!  Highly recommend!!
5.0,Very cool happy I bought it
5.0,They worked great. Very pleased with gloves.
5.0,"Ok, it is my husband who loves it... especially with the N number of his plane on it."
5.0,"This is a really nice tank top! Based on previous reviews, I worried about the arm holes being too big, and those reviews are right; the arm holes are too big. But the pros of this top far outweigh that one con, so this is a win for me.<br /><br />The fabric is a really nice weight and feels soft. This feels, dare I say...expensive? If I didn't know it, I'd think this cost much more than it did. I'm 5'9&#34;, so the length of tops is important for me, and this tank is the perfect length. I can tuck it in with plenty of room to play with it. If it's untucked, it kinf od skims my lower hips.<br /><br />The neck line is PERFECT. Not too high, not too low. I'm kind of busty, so I like to have a bit of neck and chest showing in my tops, just for elongation and proportion. I also like for my tanks to fit not too tight and not too crazy loose. I'm a true 12/14 in almost everything, and the XXXL gave me the elegant, loose fit I wanted. I'm absolutely going to order an XL to go for a tighter, sexier fit.<br /><br />This really is a great tank top for a great price. Can easily be dressed up or down, which absolutely suits my purposes."
5.0,Great price for a cute bracelet.  Bought several to give as thank you gifts.
5.0,I live it it fit perfectly
5.0,Gave as a gift and the person loved it.
5.0,a little larger than normal but will always go out of my way to get a Russell sweat shirt!!
5.0,I gave these handkerchiefs to the women in my bridal party before my wedding (because I knew they would all shed tears that day). They were beautiful and a perfect gift for my ladies!!
5.0,My son was hit at my great aunt 80th birthday party everyone loved his outfit.
5.0,Perfect for my kids homeschooling eye strain. My kids started getting really bad headaches from being on the computer for so long that I decided to buy some blue light glasses and it makes all the difference. I was really skeptical at first but the headaches are completely gone. I’m so happy with these glasses !
5.0,I absolutely love these! They are so soft and comfortable and they are exactly what I was looking for. They are good quality and they were shipped on time. I'm a small (about 5'6&#34;/115ibs) and they fit great. I have 2 colors so far and I'll be buying many more ❤️❤️
5.0,Love this watch its a good daily driver and the band is comfortable too !
5.0,Durable and comfortable
5.0,"These are great socks for any occasion, not just for fitness. My husband wore a pair to work, he works cleaning robots and sludge out of pits and he said his feet stayed dry the entire time. He has begged me to order him some more. He also wore a pair to the gym and complimented how they fit perfectly to his feet which is very important during cardio. They didn’t slide and he says his feet stayed dry once again. I would definitely recommend these to anyone. They are thick but comfortable and durable!"
5.0,Excellently made!
5.0,Great! Look just like the picture.
5.0,I love this purse!! it is perfect. Very detailed and sturdy. Perfect set!!!!
5.0,The material is very soft and light. Follow the sizing instructions and you should be fine. The &#34;O&#34; is the hole in witch your man parts come through and rest in the pouch like flap. For me the pouch is a little small. It's a great price for the very good quality. You might want to look at the David Archy
5.0,"I needed a good looking watch to wear when going out with friends.  This is a very elegant design, thin and light weight. The leather is comfortable and keeps it in place on my small wrist. The finish is subdued just as I wanted.  I needed an accessory not the main show."
5.0,Love these socks
5.0,"This thing is so awesome. There are defects here an there but it is made very well. Everyone who has seen it loved it. As someone who really likes the game I am so pleased I want another one it will be on display year round an part of my Halloween costume. It isnt to heavy,  fits well, doesnt squash your nose, & comfortable. Does not look cheap at all!"
5.0,"I love all PattyBoutik shirts, dresses and skirts! I am a loyal customer!"
5.0,Great quality for the price. Soft against the face and very pretty. Delivered promptly.
5.0,"Beautiful mask, perfect for a masquerade party! It is well built and solid! The crystals are nice and reflect the light in a way that looks magical. The design is intricate and unique. This was everything I had hoped for and we were the stars of the party!"
5.0,"This is an EXACT replacement for my Casio watch.  I used to replace the bands with plastic ones because that's all I could find, but I really like the feel of this band much better (again it is exactly the same as the band that came with the watch).  The price is very reasonable and it arrived within a few days after I ordered it."
5.0,"Fits great and feels light and breathable! I wasn't sure what to expect as a pear-shaped size 16, at 5'9&#34; and 208 lbs. The XL was perfect for me, though! The leg extended to about 2 inches above my knee, and the back was about 2-3 inches below my bra line. One reviewer had mentioned that the fabric is a bit see-through, and I agree; it's the nature of a cotton blend fabric like this. I got the beige, which is close to my flesh tone, but my dark panties showed through; I expect I could easily wear flesh-toned panties underneath with no problem. Since I am actually using this piece as the foundation for building a dance dress, I was not too worried about the slight translucence. I look forward to trying other colors in the future!"
5.0,"This is an exceptionally beautiful tutu leotard. Every girl will look like a ballerina in it.  The netting is stiff enough to not look droopy, yet not scratchy.  The design on the front is very pretty and looks like it will stay on for a very long time.  The bow in the back adds and adorable touch.  I am very happy with this purchase.  I would recommend to everyone."
5.0,This is a nice high quality belt. I love the design of this belt.<br />No more pulling the belt and inserting that thing into the hole.<br />This belt has 30 adjustments. It is 50 inches long and 1 1/4<br />inches wide. It arrived in a nice pouch inside of a nice box. This<br />belt is very easy to use. You just pull the belt through the buckle.<br />There is a lever that you push to release it.<br />Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my<br />honest and unbiased review.
5.0,"I love this wallet. Fits everything, i will probably buy it in another color for variety!"
5.0,Glasses seem very good and high quality.  Have not worn them as yet but initial impression is very good.  They do seem much darker than other glasses I have.
5.0,Color was as expected
5.0,beautiful dress for a great price
5.0,I like this item just wish I would have order a size down because ran a little big
5.0,I purchased this item from my daughter it is a great compromise for her to wear them under her skirts or under her ripped jeans and she likes it she thinks it's fashionable we will purchase this item again.
5.0,"Just like the picture described, it actually looks better in person I think. The sweater is light and comfortable to wear.  I probably would put on another jacket over it during the winter but look at how good-looking it is. I am sure it can go well with any jacket or coat in your wardrobe."
5.0,I liked that the dress is true to size.
5.0,"Awesome buy, very happy."
5.0,"I wish the chain was a little longer, but it is still a great necklace. The locket with the urn is very sturdy and seems well made. I like the flower cut out design on back and the weight of it. Very pleased with purchase."
5.0,Bought it for my daughter. She loves it.
5.0,"Another one size win for Glamaker! I'm a size 14 L/XL, 40 DDD and this looks AMAZING on me! No weird gap on the shoulder area, great length to wear with tights this fall too! The neck choker fits snug and does not sag! Nice, thick fabric. Just a great quality sweater!"
5.0,I really like the shirts well made the right length of sleeve and body and the material dries quick side not I did cut the sides because I have bigger hips
5.0,"Surprisingly a very simple, beautiful dress! Got a M fits perfect as it should ... Not too tight . This could easily be worn as a tunic as well . Not a very breathable fabric but great print &amp; fabulous price !"
5.0,As advertised good price fast shipping

5.0,comes with tool. comfortable on my wrist.....
5.0,"I usually wear flimsy small underpants but I walk all day long and it's time for some that will stay in place. I like everything high waist as it's the fashion at the moment, so I bought those underpants.<br />Things I don't like: the color is really red, not pink but that's minor. It is of course not really flattering to wear by itself. The tummy control effect isn't mind-blowing, it's just covering the belly which can be helpful.<br />All in all it's a good everyday underwear that will not roll up or down and it doesn't cut your butt cheek in half like some panties do.<br />I like: even if they are not truly invisible, if I fit them correctly on my butt they are not detectable under my clothes and this is quite awesome! The colors are nice so it doesn't look too bad when they peep out of pants. They're pretty soft."
5.0,Our granddaughter loves these.
5.0,It's that time of year when we get to wear sandals and this anklet is pretty and perfect
5.0,It’s really cute and comfortable. It fits true to size and isn’t thin but not too heavy either. It’s perfect for what we call cold in Texas.
5.0,Best purchase i’ve ever made. Did come with a small tear in the leg but was easy to sew up with a sewing machine. Ordered one size bigger than usual and was extremely satisfied.
5.0,Love this anklet. Love the colors and I would buy more.
5.0,"Very sweet, mutt mom loves them."
5.0,simply beautiful
5.0,I ordered the dress in the picture but received the longer one. My daughter still loves it and it looks great on her! One happy girl.
5.0,Bought this as a gift for a friend! She loved it!!! Super cute.
5.0,"I love the look, feel and weight of this bracelet, but have worn it only twice and it already has scratches on the clasp. I will be wearing this only for special events and not everyday or at work. Love it! It is unique and different and has a wonderful meaning."
5.0,"I use it for work everyday, still looks new."
5.0,Stays this child color for a long time w/o rusting
5.0,"I like the stayle, but the proplem is that the sleeves are too big and they are not too long it is quite good"
5.0,Absolutely love it. Great value and love the design.
5.0,My niece loved these.
5.0,"It is a beautiful, elegant dress and the fabric is very comfortable, weight 200 lbs and I measure 152 and I stay just to the average order xl 😊"
5.0,Ordered for my Mom for Christmas two of these. No two alike products and different from all the other 1928 Jewelery that I bought her in the past. Great deal for great price!
5.0,Works good but slow shipping but it is coming from China
5.0,As described. Perfect for my daughters costume
5.0,My husband loves these! He normally would not wear this type of clothing but I can happily say they were a home run.
5.0,These are my son’s absolute favorite underwear. We only have white and they have held up for over a year.
5.0,I am an RN and I bought this since I do not wear my diamonds to work.  I was looking for a nice band that would compliment my diamond right but not over take it.  I looked into a white gold wedding band but did not want to pay $300 plus for a ring.  This ring is wonderful.  A little darker than my white gold set but still goes with it nicely.  Also I would recommend that you order 1/2 size smaller than what you actually wear as they run a little big. This ring is so comfortable and nice because it does not tear my gloves or cut my patients!  Great price and shipped very quickly!  Thank you!
5.0,This hat is amazing!! The extended visor blessed my soul
5.0,"Bought a size 2 for my boy and 1 for my girl. I really love them and so do they. Comfortable for them to walk all day at the zoo. Got wet but dried fine. Both pairs are holding up fine even with them scrapping/dragging their feet because they ""like the noise"""
5.0,"Just love this sweater. The inside is so soft and plush and there are little slits on each side. It looks more formal than you would expect, lots of glitter and the side slits make it appropriate for business casual holiday wear."
5.0,"Beautiful dress. It fit as expected, the material was great for the price and if you're on the fence about purchasing, I'm here to say go for it."
5.0,Not too small and not too big. I bought turquoise :))
5.0,comfortable & beautiful
5.0,"I think the scarf actually looks much nicer in person than in the stock photos (where it looks like felt to me). It's pretty long, and a good thickness so it feels appropriate for various weather conditions. I couldn't get the color quite right on my phone, but in person, it's pretty true to color. The ""cashmere"" tag is unsightly, but easily covered. A great purchase! Love it! 😊"
5.0,Nice and comfortable but a tad bit large. I'm kinda glad though plenty of room and loose. Going to be working in them so it doesn't matter. Also if they shrink they will be perfect...if not they are still fine. Came fast so that is always a plus.
5.0,Perfect gift for my boyfriend! He loves it!
5.0,"This long sleeve is perfect! I love the thickness of the material, perfect for fall. It is nursing friendly, the neck line holds it's shape. I went off the size chart and the fit was perfect. I wish I ordered two!"
5.0,So comfortable!!
5.0,"great dress for my granddaughters they are in my sons wedding. so pretty in pink! dresses were lost in mail.. oh my.. however replaced  and received very fast, a great company to work with!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:aa7b7b46a6bcbdf6b95e0d95d584f02f]] This pendant is just gorgeous, a trio of sparkling crystals are suspended by a fine chain. Looks quite lovely on.<br />Two stones are clear, one is a purple that is the color of a dark amethyst.<br />Delicate but certainly noticeable, it would be appropriate for any age, and nearly any occasion.<br /><br />The stones are secure, it is a well made piece of costume jewelry.<br />Boxed nicely for gift giving.<br />I received this item at a promotional discount in order to test and review. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item. Views and opinions are my own."
5.0,"Perfect for summertime weather.  Very versatile, I wore as a dress with a bodysuit under it on my vaca in Jamaica and had many compliments.  I also bought 2 other colors."

5.0,"I purchasedthis purse for a wedding to go with my grape colored drwss. It was a little larger than some evening purses, which I wanted. And the beading is very pretty. The purse also has a shoulder chain which fits nicely out of the way."
5.0,"Color is a little different than picture, but exactly what I expected otherwise."
5.0,Love these! I'm 5'7&#34; 130lbs and got the S 32 and they fit perfectly! They look exactly like the picture and are very flexible! I got the dark brown and it's a lovely rich chocolate color. I haven't washed them yet.
5.0,Way it was sewed logo no good
5.0,Very cute :)
5.0,Very elegant. Good color scheme. The chain is just the right length. Overall good quality.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:c2c0b26c454c47630f7419e007b1a9ca]] Great fun mask! It's cool as described in their description. Light up with no problem. My boy loves it!
5.0,Fit and quality were great!
5.0,These are the best leggings. True to size they fit snug and hold everything in. Great for everyday or any and all workouts. I have 4 pairs. The pockets are an added bonus.
5.0,Replaced my prescription glasses for driving at night.
5.0,"This is larger than i thought it would be. It just came today and i like it. The color is nice and what i expected. It's red/maroon/wine color. Very roomy inside. I wish the inside pockets were a bit deeper. The zippered pocket is a nice size. The pockets on the front are also roomy. I like the pockets on the side, they are snug. The handles aren't long enough for me to carry comfortably on my shoulder. Using the included strap makes me feel as if im carrying a messenger bag.<br />I was on the hunt for a 'Mom' bag, that didnt look like a diaper bag. This bag does that. Nice price of 24$ when i bought it. It looks nice, nice color, roomy for all the diapers, changes of clothes, full size wipes, toys, booger wipes, tissues, my wallet, my phone, diaper rash travel size, baby powder travel size, and i still have room. I have 2 girls, 3 &amp; 10 mos. i will add baby food, snacks, ipad, and what what...maybe some make up! Ha.<br /><br />Since it's the first day, ill update if anything breaks. The hardware seems standard and durable....Except for the side clamps that are for the strap. They dont open smoothly. I think they went cheap and didnt get the ones with a spring. Idk, they kinda stick. I can tell they are cheap.<br />I like the canvas fabric. It should be easy to clean when spills happen.<br />Im very happy I listened to the other reviewers and JUST bought it wihout thinking too hard about it. I expect this bag to last me a long time. Thanks y'all!"
5.0,Good quality. Fits
5.0,"These fit perfectly and feel great. My daughter is picky about her clothes, she has to have soft comfortable clothing. These are her new favorite shorts to wear."

5.0,Really like dress. like color. Just as described.
5.0,Worked out perfectly
5.0,"They are perfect for me. I have very thin ears, hard to find earrings small enough. These are great! Comfortable to sleep in also. I just wish the company had even smaller ones for my second and third piercings. If they come up with smaller ones, I'll buy them in a heart beat."
5.0,"This dress is a winner. It fit well. The fabric had some give for comfort. The weight of the fabric was heavy enough that the skirt draped in a flattering way that did not accentuate any lumps, bumps, or unintended curves. I'm 5' 0"" and it fit me as a midi length. I highly recommend this dress."
5.0,The color was brighter then I expected but I really like it. The zipper pocket inside was a bit smaller then expected too but its fine. Fits all the things I need.
5.0,Great necklace...love the bigger size!!
5.0,"Got these for working out and liked them so much I ordered another set. These fit true to size and are long enough for my 5'8"" frame!! Very comfortable and wash like a dream. Can't go wrong with these. Love 'em!!"
5.0,"I was hesitate to buy gloves online, but these are great...glad I did"
5.0,This was such a great find especially for the price! I love that it was high to low so I didn’t have to worry about the front length of the dress. I wore it to a local charity event that we are covering for the show and got tons of compliments on it!

5.0,I get a lot of compliments on them. They look fantastic.

5.0,Item arrived exactly as described with quick shipping. I had initially purchased the wrong size ( my fault not the seller) and they exchanged that gi for another one no problem! Great item great seller!

5.0,"I've only had these for a few weeks, but so far they have been very comfortable while exercising and traveling by plane."
5.0,"I bought this dress for my granddaughter to wear to a Beauty Pageant she was in. She won 1ST Runner Up and First Place in the Photo Contest. She’s 7 1/2 years old, I had about 4” cut off because it was too long. She looked beautiful!!!"
5.0,Decent quality fabric and stitching. Comfortable to wear.

5.0,Good protection and look
5.0,"This dress is super cute. Fabri  is strange but it is a great color and style. Just need a little alteration.<br /><br />The back is gorgeous with the bow at the back. It is not too short and I am looking forward to wearing it soon.<br /><br />Bust: 36D, hip: 47/48, waist: 37"

5.0,This dress is perfect. I've been wearing it around to all the holiday parties with low heel knee high boots and I've been getting compliments left and right. It's very thick material but forgiving. It's become one if my favorite dresses.
5.0,So cute! Great quality!! Great for the price!
5.0,"Cool hat (snapback). Wish it didn't have that green fabric under the visor (had no way of knowing of the green fabric as it is not noted in the pictures or the description). With that said, good quality hat, and fun, cause... Who doesn't like chillin? Haha. See pictures for more details on hat."
5.0,Muy lindo el vestido y muy cómodo.
5.0,Love it....
5.0,"These are gorgeous!! So soft and comfortable - as good as Lularoe at a much more affordable price. The OS (One Size) truly fits nicely on women who wear a size all the way up to an 18.  The colors and designs are mind-boggling!! So MANY to choose from!!  I am 5' tall and a size 8-12 depending on the style or cut, whether it's a top, dress, pant suit, shorts/capris, or these leggings.  These are amazing!  The ONLY thing I would rather have on these would be a wider waistband for a little more comfort, but other than that - you won't be disappointed at all!!"
5.0,For a SMALL face.
5.0,Good price for solid quality
5.0,I just wish the shorts for longer
5.0,Got them for my son and he loved the way they fit.
5.0,This product provides a great backdrop and is just great for frivolity.
5.0,Nice quality and fit is good. The buckle has good attachment. Have used as regular belt and also in tactical situations. Recommend if you're looking for a good heavy duty tactical belt.
5.0,"This is a very cute accessory if blue is your favorite color, and the blue is very vibrant. I love the heart design that it has, I am very happy with how early it came. It was suppose to come from August 14 or August 30, but I got it durning the near end of July. I hope that this product last a very long time :)"
5.0,Very nice. No complaints .  Fair price.
5.0,"Originally ordered a medium and had to get a  large instead. I am 170lbs, wear a size 8 in jeans. I have a bigger booty, so I wasn’t really shocked about the medium not fitting the way I would have wanted.<br />Pictured is the large, I ordered a body suit to wear with it and have on heels (5’5) feet and they are perfect at the bottom!! Super comfortable and I feel sexy in this outfit. I got for a wedding that’s coming up and since it’s winter months, I skipped wearing a dress. Highly recommend!"
5.0,I love my sunglasses I recommend to anybody for the price they are GREAT.
5.0,Just changed my mind and returned.  Not flattering for my big frame.  I did get compliments.  Sleeves way too long—has to push them up just to achieve wrist length.
5.0,Nice as a swimsuit cover up or sundress. Dress up or dress down.
5.0,"These are the best leggings I've ever owned. They are sooooo soft and comfortable. The fit is awesome! They don't shrink when you wash them it and they are just as soft afterwards. I ordered this trio and since I loved them so much, I went back and bought the other colors as well. If you are a legging connoisseur like me, buy these! 8"
5.0,Love this very light weight shirt. Very comfortable and made well.
5.0,"I was looking for a lighter all-day back pack, and also to have many compartments for all kind of small stuff I may want to put in. This backpack certainly fits my needs. I was a little afraid it would be to big (I already have 2 bigger backpacks and I needed a smaller one) but it's not. It seems to be made from a very durable material and robust zippers.<br />I can say I am really satisfied of this product.<br />UPDATE: I bought two more for some colleagues, they were impressed by this product."
5.0,"This was purchased as a gift, I was nervous ordering online. I was honestly pleasantly surprised at delivery with the quality and style. I’m told it washed well and has held up."
5.0,"It's beautiful, but the size is 2cm x 2cm, the whole cm less than in the description. Attached is a photo of pendant compared to a US quarter coin for your reference. Other than that it's very nice and of good quality."
5.0,A gift to a friend that made her day!
5.0,Love it! Fast service and great product – thank you!

5.0,My girlfriend loved the robe and within a few hours I got the expected results.. So for me.. 100% of the time this robe works every time... I am the new mayor of sexy town!
5.0,Love these! They fit great and feel very comfortable.
5.0,Ppl give me compliments on my shoes all the time.
5.0,John Deere best socks
5.0,"These are as good as I've  had. They clip on easily with little fuss for placement. Lenses are polarized, thus cutting down a bit of glare. They flip up/down easily one-handed or even with mittens -- this is very important to me because, while my eyes can't stand brightness, I also can't see in dim light. For example, I have to be able to adjust instantly from sun to shade if I'm riding my bike along a trail with intermittent trees. I don't know what I'd do without shades of this type. They do wear out -- because I'm always hauling them around, they eventually get abraded and have rough spots in the field of view. But, if you need them, as I do, well worth the cost of periodic replacement."
5.0,Loved it! Fit perfect and I got tons of compliments!
5.0,I bought these a little bigger than my daughter's size. Its just as shown in the display photo
5.0,"look so cute on and friendly, sporty with class."

5.0,keeps me very warm during the cold months!
5.0,"I love these bands!  They are not big, wide, and bulky.  They look amazing in my watch.  Slim and classy.  I ordered several colors!  They have held up very well."
5.0,"Love this pair of shoes, esp. that they are made from recycled plastics! Protect the ocean!"
5.0,Great vgreat value for the monealue
5.0,Really cute 50's bracelet to wear with my poodle skirt outfit in Las Vegas costume wedding. Easy to get on and off... Adds a nice touch to the outfit!
5.0,Very pleased with the product 👍
5.0,"I was looking for a pretty modest and  feminine dress and I am very very picky.<br />I wasn't sure if it was right for me but, I tried it on for a male family member who said ""that dress is beautiful and it looks good on you"".<br />It fits  your shape nicely without being overly tight or revealing.<br />I got the red and I may order it in other colors .<br />Couldn't be happier with this purchase."
5.0,They are made well. The details are good. Not sloppy. Very cute! I will be getting a second pair in a different color
5.0,Love my Angel Kiss purse.  Very roomy and lots of pockets .  Very soft  and pretty!

5.0,teah it's pretty good
5.0,Feels and looks to be of good quality
5.0,My mom loved it very much
5.0,Gun stocking stuffer
5.0,I used it as the choker. I have way tiny wrists so the bracket didn't fit but I loved the choker. Lots of compliments :)
5.0,These were exactly what I needed. The fit the watch perfectly.
5.0,I've this top light weigh not see through very flattering
5.0,"OK, It is a not a cheap watch.  Very Basic....no date, manual winding and no bells and whistles which you might see in other and cheaper options.  This is a nostalgic purchase.  I grew up on the space coast watching Skylab and the Shuttle go up and now SpaceX and ULA.  I have been careful with it and it hold great time as long as you wind it.  I was a little annoyed that the vendor or Omega puts a security band like you get at a concert through the band which states ‘No returns if removed.’  This is annoying since you cannot close the clasp to see how the watch looks.<br /><br />The shipping method the vendor sent required a signature, which is not a problem, but they sent it up where I could not redirect the box to a FedEx location since I would not be home...I struggled with this during shipment.  However, the FedEx delivered it to a local WalGreens where I was able to sign and pick it up.  It would have been helpful to know this in advance.<br /><br />For a Stainless Steel watch it is surpassing light and thin.  I am sort of a watch nut and will keep this watch and pass it down to my kids."
5.0,"YES, a VERY FEW of these did not work, but what a bang for your buck!!!!!!!!!!!! I am VERY HAPPY. No more mechanic with flashlight in his mouth under the hood. SOOOOOOOOOO many uses!!! Price RIDICULOUSLY cheap! Used for choir in candlelight service."
5.0,"Light, soft fabric. Good quality for the money. The Pom poms are so cute and just what I wanted. Love the bright colors! It is a bit see through, which I like for a coverup. I am 5’4” about 140 pounds and this JUST fits me, could be a little longer if I had a choice. So, I really don’t agree that “one size fits all”. I would say this is probably close to a medium. Overall, I recommend! Can’t wait to wear it on vacation!!"
5.0,"If you're a size 7, you need to get an 8 because they run small. Still love them!"
5.0,Amazing! I LOVE this tank! It's extremely comfortable and stretchy and absolutely adorable. Highly recommend to fellow yogis.

5.0,"I liked the  Slim RFID Blocking Wallet I purchased .Tt is exactly what I was looking for, I can put my ID in the front clear window and a couple of credit cards in the sleeves  . I like the zip compartment to put a little cash inside. I will buy it again in the future, maybe in black."
5.0,This dress fits well. I ordered a medium and I’m 5 foot 125 lbs. I got a lot of compliments on it.

5.0,"Love this dress! Should've gotten an extra small, but the small fits fine! 120lbs, 5'0&#34; if that helps anyone! Color is gorgeous in person. Definitely shorter in the back, but I like it! Wasn't sure before purchasing, but glad I did!"
5.0,"Super comfy, long length/great coverage, great with leggings, washes well (but I always hang-dry). I bought both styles. Love them both."

5.0,IT MATCHED MY COACH BAG PERFECTLY I ALWAYS HAVE TO TAKE THE ORIGINAL TO GET REPLACED AND DECIDED TO GET AN EXTRA BUT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL VERY STURDY AND HOLDS ALL THE WEIGHT I CARRY IN MY BAG.
5.0,Dress fits true to size nice stretch easy to dress up or more casual would buy another one in a different color!
5.0,I like very much of this pants ! Very comfortable! I’m enjoying going to the gym and use at home.
5.0,"Lovely earrings, just beautiful with a touch of sparkle!"
5.0,"Very pretty. Delicate and petite stones. The dangly part bothers me, but I think it's only because my cats keep trying to play with it while it's on my wrist. I would buy again, and it would make a nice gift."
5.0,"I love these! They are so easy to slip on and go feed the animals, muck the corals, and collect the eggs."
5.0,"Excellent product.<br />Shipping was decent-product arrived 4 days earlier than expected. I have received several compliments on it already even though no ome knows where the desing came from. A little larger than I thought, which I like and I imediately put it on the free chain rather than the black one it came on. I'm probably going to buy the kakashi style next!"
5.0,beautiful fit and texture
5.0,Huge hit with the whole family! I gave them out to all family and relatives with whom we exchanged gifts. It added much needed Christmas spirit and cheer to the otherwise low key year.
5.0,Good.. Just what I needed..
5.0,This is absolutely perfect!! Amazing quality and not too thick. Perfect for Walt Disney World on Halloween- not too thick for the weather here. I usually wear a large/xl took the chance and went up to the xxl per the reviews for a looser fit and it’s absolutely perfect fit.
5.0,So sexy and I’m chubby but there was no fat showing
5.0,My daughter picked this dress to wear to the father/daughter dance. It is a very pretty dress. I ordered a petticoat so that her dress looked like the picture.It was windy so you can't tell. She's 9 years old and wears a size 7 in pants and a 6/6X shirt.
5.0,"Great look and feel, makes the gear look more like a watch. Has some weight but not heavy didn't need to adjust for fit on my big hands. Did crack my screen pressing to hard to snap them in so be careful with that. The snap lock makes it more secure than original bands."
5.0,"Estaba temerosa por lo que me llegaría pero me encanto, a mi hijo le quedo super lindo , buena calidad , recomendado!"
5.0,"AMAZING!!! I was scared it would fit too small or be bad quality but I read all of the reviews and decided to purchase. I LOVE IT!! I order in The middle of January, it wasn't set to arrive until April but it arrived the first week of February. I am normally an 11 but I ordered a 10 that was the largest size at the time. Just buy it!"
5.0,This is a beautiful bonnet!  Well made!
5.0,WIFE LOVES THEM!!!
5.0,I get complements on this shirt every time I wear it. It’s very comfortable and fits well.
5.0,Comfortable...light weight..Used it for MTN Biking 👍👍
5.0,Absolutely love this toe ring. It is exactly as described.
5.0,I ordered a XXL and it fits really comfortable not too loose and not too snug. I ordered on 6/19/15 and it arrived on 6/24/15.
5.0,"Quality product. 47"" laces, size 10.5 shoe. Ordered these to replace a thin (dress-shoe variety) lace on a pair of running shoes. Sturdy laces. Lightweight, strong when streched, reflective and a non-slip single tie. Color matched perfectly. Had to use a hemostat to install these as they were a tight fit through the eyelits. Definitely worth purchasing."
5.0,Great deal. Nice quality. Big hit for all the kidd.
5.0,"The length of the short is okay, but I think it also depends on your size. I bought M size it fit me well. I have run a couple of times with this short to check whether how early I was going to sweat. It met my expectations since after running an hour per day, it didn’t feel uncomfortable in my short, means does not consume the sweat to much)"
5.0,I like this product to much
5.0,"Attractive  Cufflinks and Studs Set, great to have for those special  occasion, I  received  this  product  at  a  reduced  rate  in  exchange  for  a  honest  helpful  review"
5.0,I had bought a set of sports bras with foam pads inside. The pads ended up falling to peices after a few washes. I bought these to replace those foam pads and they work nicely.
5.0,Great fit for a great price!
5.0,"I've tried a few different straps for my Inspire HR, but this is the only one that I've been happy with. It's so comfy, I forget I have it on. It's easy to move out of the way, when washing dishes, hands etc, and dries fast if it does get wet. The strap is soft and, because there's no buckles or clasps, there's nothing to rub against sensitive skin. I'm probably going to order a few more, just for variation in colour. It's easy to attach, and detach. I'm pretty rough with it, and it hasn't stretched out of shape or fallen off."
5.0,Just as pictured and advertised. I used them to pull a coat that was too big together in the back to take up some extra room. They hold tight and worked great.
5.0,"I'm very petite (5ft) and ordered an XS. It fits amazing. The quality of the fabric is better than expected, not thin at all. I was going to use it to work out but is way to nice for that!"
5.0,Super comfortable! Super cute!!
5.0,"I love this shirt. It's comfortable, good quality and light."
5.0,"These earrings are even more prettier in person than I thought they would be! I purchased them for my 8th grade school formal, and initially I was afraid that they were going to turn out to be too big or worse, too HEAVY ON MY EARS. I hoped that they would turn out to be perfect, and they did! I think they're so beautiful and they look like real glistening crystals! Was definitely worth every penny, especially at such an excellent price!"
5.0,Very lightweight yet durable. I've had them for several months now & they're still like new. A good quality product.
5.0,Great support and feel snug for workouts.  Its a slight bit tighter than expected but that is better than a loose workout bra.
5.0,Love the pendant but the chain looks cheap..
5.0,I was very pleased with my purchase!  The dress is adorable and such a GREAT price!!
5.0,I am 5ft 3in 180lbs bought the xl. I felt beautiful. It fit perfict. Was a little long but I am short lol. The plastic did smell a little so I washed it in cold and hung dry before I wore it. Quality is awesome it is thick material and heavy. Highly recommend.
5.0,Great support while remaining confortable
5.0,I love it. Have ordered another. It is a bit too large but I will wear a tee shirt under it.
5.0,I remember having these as a kids myself and knew they would be perfect for my daughter as we cannot pierce her ears right now. She loves them so much. She picks out a new pair every day. They stay put rather well we I found them stuff to other things in the house. They do not leave behind a stickiness thankfully.
5.0,Super cute!! Very comfortable and stylish. I bought two different ones and love them both! 💕
5.0,Could not wear it as although I bought a size up it was still too small. Gave it as a gift
5.0,Dress is perfect fit

5.0,Yay I love it
5.0,"A little smallish in the chest area but it's so pretty, I'm keeping it. Good quality fabric and the color is gorgeous. Excited to wear it this Fall or Winter."
5.0,I bought these looking for something different than what I normally wear and they fit great and are very breathable as well.

5.0,"nice fit, looks nice."
5.0,"Comfortable, not as ironic of you actually have boobs"
5.0,"Slides on small silver necklace to make my own ""Mothers"" necklace for my wife. Great to have separate simple charms."
5.0,I bought this to wear in a wedding.  The pieces are not too big or too small...just perfect to wear with a simple dress.
5.0,It’s very nice I bought it for personal use
5.0,I've only been wearing this band for about a week and a half but it has been a good experience so far. I love the latch on this band it is super easy to do one handed and quick. It is a little slicker material on the inside than the original but overall the band is softer so it's more comfortable in my opinion. So far the band has stayed latched throughout daily activities and sleeping. I'm hoping this strong hold will continue over time. I would definatly recommend this band to anyone looking for a band to replace the original Gear Fit 2 Small band.
5.0,"These masks worked for both my 7 and 10 year olds.  They fit perfect and are comfortable enough for them to wear at school all day. No complaints here, and you cannot beat the price!"
5.0,Soft material and fits as expected
5.0,They worked great for the wife for work.
5.0,"This is a really cute set of jade car mirror hanging beads. The jade is really pretty and it is well cut, so it is good quality. I gave one to my mom so we match. My only complaint is how short the string is, you have to actually take your mirror off to get it on."
5.0,It was very cute. I bought it for my granddaughter and she loved it.
5.0,"Was a bit worried about fitment because that is always an issue when shopping due to sizing differences varying by company, but this fit as expected and its really good quality. Satisfied with my buy."
5.0,She loves it! Stylish and practical! Great value!
5.0,"As a VFW Auxilary member, I’m always looking for nice patriotic things to wear.  This worked great for Veterans Day  and will for all the days I need them. They look nice and are easy to put on."
5.0,need all the warmth I can get
5.0,I got this for a friends birthday and she loved it! The product was very cute and looked like good quality material. Almost wanted to buy another one for myself!
5.0,It’s is perfect.
5.0,Have these on now and really like them.
5.0,I use them as bandannas for my dogs...cute!
5.0,Beautiful product as described. Nicely packaged. Prompt shipping.
5.0,"These bands are great.  I love the style of them.  I had no issues changing them from my Fitbit Inspire HR.  They clicked right in!  FYI - The bands are smooth and the base of the bands are white (the underside), but the catch is black.  I really like these bands and would recommend them to anyone."
5.0,"These earring backs really stay put, and they're comfortable, too (a difficult combination to find).  I've lost expensive earrings before by their being pulled off (wind, small children, dogs can all loosen them).  I doubt that I'll ever lose another earring with these new backs."
5.0,Absolutely love them. They are a little tight but will do. Feels like I don't have a ring on. Perfect for work and fishing and any activity. I love that I can change the color to match my outfit.
5.0,"My husband loved these, perfect birthday gift."
5.0,Great hat!  Nice quality and strangely enough it fit perfectly without me having to adjust the size!
5.0,I love the dress but it fits a little tighter than I'd like--afraid the extra large would be too big.
5.0,"These are good...just what I wanted. I do wish they were sold individually because I only needed one. But, I really can’t complain.  Good quality, not expensive. I am happy with this purchase."
5.0,Very nice. Would order again.
5.0,Very nice...!!!
5.0,"They are as beautiful as pictured on the page, lots of rich colors.  I like it when reviews have picture, but not need this time because the photos on this page present them well, accurate.  The are solid, not cheap, they would be difficult to damage.  There is a bit of weight to them but not too much."
5.0,Works great in cold weather. Keeps you warm and dry.
5.0,Love this mask gaiter since we are now being forced to wear them at work.  You can easily breath though it unlike other masks and it's very comfortable.
5.0,This is not a cheap looking as I thought it would be. A little thicker of a chain which is nice. I loke it! Shipping came alot faster than I thought.
5.0,Work perfect
5.0,Order 2-3 sizes up!
5.0,Fitted very nicely. Cute. It is thin fabric so perfect for spring season.
5.0,Such soft and comfy!<br />I bought my daughter a set also!
5.0,This is an absolutely adorable shirt. It's true to size and the color is exactly as expected. The fit is comfortable and material feels great.<br /><br />It made it through the first wash without shrinking much and the decal stayed in tact perfectly. There was no fading of the color.<br /><br />This is just a sweet little shirt to add to your wardrobe.
5.0,I usually purchase these loose fitting shirts to hide my unlost baby weight gain and quarantine 15. The sleeves are loose fitting and is light weight all around. Will eventually purchase other shirts in different colors.
5.0,"Lightweight, but also warm. Great purchase."
5.0,These are great. They are light and stylish. They do a great job of blocking the glare from icy roads!
5.0,Pretty and finishes off a couple of outfits. Well made.
5.0,We bought these for my mom. This is the type they give her in the hospital. They wear very well and wash nicely. We do not care for the socks and slippers that have the small round grippers as they do not glide as smoothly and could cause our mother to catch and stumble. These are great and the only advise I would give besides buy these is go up a size. We got the large and found them to be a bit snug at the toes.
5.0,"My dad loved this so much it made him cry and he put it on his keys right away. I am happy with the quality and lettering, and would buy other personalized gifts from here."
5.0,One of my wife favorite dress. The fabric stretch so according to my wife it's flattering to her figure. The flow of the dress falls nicely as well. It's a lightweight dress but not super light. She is 5'4 and about a little over 130 and the small fits her. Color and style is exactly like picture shown.
5.0,Favorite dress find of the season! A woman stopped me while I was walking to tell me how much she liked the dress. I told her I found it on Amazon and she got super excited.
5.0,"Another great classic, rare and unique jersey! This is wonderfully made. Great material, nice stitching. Cannot go wrong with $18. Stunning quality, comparable to any other jersey for 100 or more. Fits great, looks great! Perfect"
5.0,Price and quality
5.0,Perfect in every way. Daughter loves it

5.0,Good love it
5.0,"got it today, it is beautiful"
5.0,Happy with item!
5.0,Great company the ones I bought came earlier Than expected. Buy the winter ones with the tag on the outside way better fit. Stocking up on these bad boys!
5.0,"After being thoroughly disappointed by inadvertently buying a thinner gauge, much tighter item, I found these and they were exactly what I wanted, good quality, good price and comfortable ..."
5.0,"This product is extremely well made. High quality brown, wool tweed, Irish made by the Mucros Weavers of Killarney. The front and back are wool, and the vest is lined. Two small outside pockets. Buttons appear to be plastic, simulated leather. This is a very good value. I checked out Mucros Weavers after receiving this vest and seeing how high the quality is. Looking forward to colder weather so I can wear it all the time. Dry clean only. It's the real deal."
5.0,These are the best joggers I have ever bought! They are legging material but in jogger form. I will definitely be buying another pair. I bought a size S and I’m 5’3” and they fit perfectly!
5.0,Very comfortable. A little longer for those of us who don't like really like short running shorts. I've been really happy with everything I've bought from this company.
5.0,Perfect for a treat bag gift
5.0,"I wear 2 in my nose (18g 6mm) & 1 in my lip (14g 8mm) & all 3 are comfortable to keep in 24/7, fit tightly w/o any extra space while each can still move & rotate freely, and can be inserted or removed quickly, much easier than any seamless segment or captive bead ring I’ve ever used."
5.0,The dress material is nice for spring weather.it fits very well and does not rise up. The sizing is correct as well.
5.0,I liked the price!! I loved the dress!!
5.0,This coat fits my daughter perfectly
5.0,It was beautiful it for so perfect i am pleased
5.0,Perfect fit and good material.
5.0,The pic doesn't do this little flying owl justice!  It's more detailed than the picture lets on.  The chain is super pretty and complements the owl very well.
5.0,Bare Traps have some of the most comfortable shoes. I absolutely love them!!!
5.0,Great coverage.
5.0,"Looks beautiful, but I haven't seen it yet.  My brother said it's awesome though, so I am looking forward.  Giving it 5+ stars based on my finicky brother's  opinion...  We plan to modify this just a bit (add feathers and shading) for a Quetzalcoatl costume. Will update with future fotos."
5.0,"High quality head covering. Satin lining to protect the hair, the wrap is connect into a loop. It fits my head even with faux locs because it has a nice stretch. This is a good item"

5.0,He loves it! Added his kids’ pic
5.0,I just loved this necklace was everything that i was looking for.
5.0,This is a sexy little tank top that provides protection during workouts. I love the gradient color and it’s a good size. Wish for more padding but it’s all good :)
5.0,"Great support, and has a beautiful design. Fits tighter, but in a comfortable way. Does not cause the &#34;back fat&#34; look that similar sports bras do."
5.0,"Sleek, small for when you don't want to carry bulky purse"
5.0,Bought these hoodies for my boyfriend and I this last Valentine's Day. They are perfect! I have washed them both several times and the color and the words are both still in great condition!
5.0,"I wear Vibram five finger V-trails and these socks make walking and working (4.8k) daily better. Keep my feet stable in my shoes and help with sweat. The colors are easy to match with whatever you are wearing and have a great fit. I tend to buy men's five toe socks since they are better made. For the price point, you can't get a better deal."
5.0,It’s for a wedding gift.
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this jacket!!! The small is just a bit big on me but i think the XS would be too small. Overall, fabulous jacket! I have yet to wear it when i don't get a compliment on it!"
5.0,This choker was perfect for my Tim Curry Worst Witch inspired outfit and just perfect as a choker overall. It works with a lot of my outfits for Fall and I always get compliments on it.

5.0,I bought these for all of the mothers in my life for mother's day back in May. My mom is still wearing hers and it has not tarnished or anything. They all loved them.
5.0,it was a little to long but otherwise it fit
5.0,Way better than expected. And literally was on my front porch the next day.
5.0,"So used to getting asian sized the XL was gigantic, but still a quality shirt and my most complimented piece at work."
5.0,Love the colors and fits perfectly on my 2 year old. Love the long sleeves.
5.0,Very comfortable and fit great.

I want to order more in other colors too!"
5.0,"Leds stopped working after two days, send it back for refund."
5.0,I am now a fan of Grid-It.  These are great for keeping things organized in a backpack or other travel gear.
5.0,My son loves these water shoes so much he wears them as slippers around the house. They also work for running around on our deck because the deck is in the sun and can get hot. They certainly protect his little feet. I ordered an 8 which is his regular shoe size but they run big. I kept them anyway. He has chubby feet so it’s nice and roomy.
5.0,Exactly as I had hope. Works great!
5.0,Came nicely packaged and on time. I ordered a size smaller than what I usually wear and still feels extremely comfortable. Would not mind ordering more
5.0,Looks just like the original band but much higher quality. The lining is leather instead of the synthetic material that Citizen uses  (which cracks almost immediately ) - why Citizen would put a cheap strap on an all stainless watch with a sapphire crystal is beyond me. The fact that you can use your original buckle is a real plus.
5.0,In love with my new bathing suit !!!!! I have never been the girl who was comfortable wearing bikinis and showing my stomach.  I bought this to give it a shot and I'm in love with it. Fit perfectly. Now just to test it out when I go swimming 😊
5.0,"Fits perfectly, only the zipper got messed when I try to take it off"
5.0,I ordered these as I wear a Fitbit without a second hand and I need it for patients.  Read how someone had clipped it around their stethescope tubing and it works PERFECTLY!  Shared with my colleagues. SO glad to find a solution for a great price!
5.0,Cute dress - great for summer wedding
5.0,I pleasantly surprised by how well the dress is made. I like the dress but I definitely need to go up a size so I have to return it. It fits but I'm not comfortable with something very fitted and would be more comfortable in the next size up.
5.0,They were amazing.  Love all the  colors.
5.0,"Very nice quality and even though I changed from bulky stuffed bi-fold, It hold much.Like the color and price."
5.0,"Love all the Chakra bracelets, I give as gifts for people who are struggling"
5.0,"I love this bracelet.  It reminds me of the jewelry I used to buy in Cherokee North Caroline .  Very well made but looks like the ones hand made by the Cherokees.  I have purchased others from this seller and I love putting more than one on it really looks great and I get so many compliments on them.  I plan to buy more from this seller.  The seller is nice and you can tell they really want to please the buyer.  I would recommend them to anyone, they are really great.  I am so glad I found them."
5.0,I bought these for my 6 year old daughter she loves them! They look just like they are pictured! Light weighted and I’m glad they are hypoallergenic because she has sensitive ears...

5.0,This will make a great Aldi bag for lite trips.
5.0,"The charm holders worked perfectly for two charms I had for my Pandora bracelet. I could not find this kind from the local jewelers.  I really wanted to display my new charms, with these I can."
5.0,My Lil girl loves hello kitty she wears them all the time and they look really adorable on her the quality of the earings are a 5 star
5.0,very big butterfly medallion....wish it came in gold tone also...
5.0,I’ve tried a couple bracelets for my FitBit and this is my favorite. It seems to stay on well and I like that it has the leather strap so I can adjust it because I have small wrists.

5.0,So soft and perfect fit.  Actually bought the flamingo and hedgehogs
5.0,My son loved this product and he wears it all of the time he originally bought it as part of his halloween costume
5.0,"This dress is truly fantastic, the material is very forgiving, I ordered a medium and it was perfect, I have gotten several compliments on it.  It has some bunching at the hips that needs to be adjusted, but not bad."
5.0,Bought for my mechanic husband. He kept burning his head underneath the cars and usually hats don't fit right. He loves this. Also helps from sweat going down his face.
5.0,It is a very attractive bracelet
5.0,Very lovely necklace. Solid piece through and through.
5.0,These shoe bags are the best! They are light but durable... I love that they show a portion of the shoe while keeping the dust out. I used to keep all my shoes in their boxes. These are space savers!!!
5.0,Great price for all of these. They are as shinny as the picture
5.0,This is way better than I thought way softer on the wrist theni thought and my daughter actualy likes it she wants pull me around lovelove
5.0,I’ve gotten lots of compliments on this hat lol
5.0,I bought this product for one of my workers and she washes dishes and we didn’t have an apron that could keep her from getting soaked from water so yeah she loves it a lot and keeps her dry and the quality is really nice it doesn’t feel or look cheap so it was a good investment.
5.0,"These are really cool leggings with a fantastic design to boot!  The material is really soft and the &#34;stretchiness&#34; would allow a wide variety of shapes and sizes to wear these comfortably.  The waistband is really high, like 1980's high, but since the fabric is so stretchy it doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review that is truthful and unbiased, which I have done. If my experience with the product changes in an unreasonable measure I will update my review."
5.0,"I love these!!!! I ordered the 2x because a lot of the reviews said they ran small so I ordered up but I really wish I hadn’t because now they are definitely big on me, comfortable but as time goes on and they get more wear they won’t fit as well. My advice, don’t order up a size, either go off of the size chart or down a size because they stretch out very fast. Other than that I have no complaints and I love them!"
5.0,"Perfect swimsuit, super cute and for those mammas with a few extra lbs, flattering. Never thought I'd wear a 2 piece swimsuit again!"
5.0,My old spikes were toast.. these help while on the trails with traction when the conditions are wet.

5.0,Love this bra! It looks like I’m wearing a traditional wire bra but doesn’t feel like it. Still getting used to all of the clasps which can be tricky but it’s the best wireless bra I’ve tried by far! Style isn’t my favorite.
5.0,It stoped well above my belly button. Very crop in the front.
5.0,Very comfortable shirt. Arrive within 2 days of my order being placed. Will order another one soon.
5.0,"We let our son pick the futsal show he wanted and he.l chose these. Perfect fit, sleek colors, and sturdy shoe! He loves them. They work well on the indoor field surface. Would definitely purchase again."
5.0,"This bra fits me perfectly with the comfort I was hoping for. It is well-constructed, has no extra junk sewn on it that would detract from the natural shape of my body! Instead of making my bust stand out unnaturally, it gives a contour that is slightly larger with less sag than this old gal has at this stage in my life! In fact, I have ordered a second in another color. I recommend this company and their products."
5.0,The dress came a day early-perfect. The material and fit was just right
5.0,It looks really cool and is easy to read
5.0,My husband loves these. I've worn them myself and as far as this style of glasses go I think they are by far the most comfortable.
5.0,"These beads seem to be very good quality.  It is a beautiful piece.  The tiger eye is gorgeous and ads a lovely contrast to the obsidian.  The prayer bead is definitely unique.  Given the natural flaws in each bead, no two strings will be exactly alike.  I only have two problems, but they aren't enough to affect my opinion on it.  There are more than 108 beads and the string is elastic."
5.0,Get a size larger but great product
5.0,"These pants are sooooo comfortable!!! They are just harem style shorts with leggings attached, but I love the fit! The leggings are soft and the shorts part are a thicker material. Love the pockets as well!"
5.0,My students loved these on mustache day! Worked perfectly!
5.0,These leggings are beautiful!  I get a lot of compliments on them.  I am pretty short (5'1&#34;) and the fit nicely and don't look awkward.  Material is great for yoga.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:1b8c4d21c690a6bd00ab891de9b03fc9]] I’ve bought I believe 4 of these already because I love them so much!<br />Super comfy and the colors I have bought do seem to be squat proof. But if u want to be safe just wear same color or nude undies. Incase it’s helpful although we all Carry our weight differently, I am 5’4’’ about 167lbs I have a mommy belly flab which these leggings help with.<br /><br />I’ve gotten size Large but my last pair was a Medium that fit more snug which I don’t mind.<br /><br />I want to try out the shorts next!!!!<br /><br />Don’t hesitate try these and you won’t regret it."
5.0,Very minimalist which i kind of like these days now! Thank u!
5.0,"This dress is a nice, thick fabric.  It's long (past the knees).  I'm 5&#34;4, 36DD, 33&#34; inch waist; a large (L) fits great on me. This was definitely worth buying."
5.0,"great, good materials, well made, launders well."

5.0,"This is really a great purse.  I recently purchased a purse that retailed at $80, and this one is BETTER!  Lots of roomy compartments, well made. I don't think you'll be sorry.  I'm certainly not! Actually thinking of purchasing one in a different color."
5.0,Very pretty. Pleased with the quality. Several layers so not see through which was my concern😊
5.0,"Im 5'2 and fluctuate between 116-120lbs. This is not for anyone much taller or heavier than that. Just don't waste your time. I have long legs so they fit nice in length but I have thick thighs and I have to strategically pick these up past my thighs becuase they are so tight. Once they are on though, it is soooooooo comfy! I have not washed it yet."
5.0,It's beautiful . I just love it .

5.0,I think it's really cute and I love it!
5.0,Honestly we weren’t sure what to expect but wanted to try! My sister turned 15 in April and we bout this to do some late quinceañera pictures. So worth it! She loves the dress and it fits her perfectly. It’s gorgeous especially for the price!

5.0,"[[VIDEOID:caa2522dd67b5841a49639fe7f5baf1b]] very lightweight - forget it's on my wrist until I want to know the time and not pull out my phone and click stuff.<br />very bright - when I received it yesterday I went in a closet for darkness and it wasn't bright. But, fast becoming the new love of my life, I wore it to bed and in the darkness it was very bright. But the minute and hour hands could be a little wider so the titrium is as bright as the hour marks on the watch. One reviewer complained about the band - that the end ended at the side of his wrist. I made a video to show an easy way to solve that - just bend the end and tuck into the strap. When taking off the watch, pull from near the buckle part, don't try to pull out what you tucked in. I'm all about efficiency and simplicity and this solution works... or I just don't tuck in the now kinda bent band end. When I travel to countries like Vietnam, I want a watch I can wear to bed and easily see what time it is in the (cheap) hotel room. This watch will do it. When I'm over my cold I'll try wearing it swimming - one review said he did. I read that warm/hot water can  mess with the inside seal, and that ATM is for still water, not rushing water such as bigger waves in the ocean, waterfalls, maybe swimming. I hope I hear back from company support staff before I try it out swimming.<br /><br />Ok I've had this watch a few weeks and love more. Yesterday I swam 20 laps in chlorinated pool and no leakage. I won't shower or hot tub with it on because research says that can soften the inside liner that keeps water out. I wear it to bed every night, nice not to have to take it off at night, put it on in the morning before coffee. Buy it, you'll love!"
5.0,Love this hat. I get so many compliments.

5.0,"I ordered this for my granddaughter who loves lime green, she'll absolutely love it!  It doesn't look cheap, looks much nicer than the $1.99 I paid, and is about twice as big as I expected it to be.  I have others I've been waiting to order in other colors and will go ahead now that I know what to expect!"
5.0,Love it! I have worn and washed it several times now. Fits slouchy and comfy!  Long enough to wear with tights or just y’all boots.
5.0,love it..
5.0,Love it!  I ordered according to the size chart by bust size since that’s where I usually have problems and it was perfect!  Very cute dress. I’m 5’5” and it’s about 2-3” above my knee.  Wish they had other patterns because I’d order more.
5.0,I love this!  Its so cutesy & old timey.  Happy with this product :)
5.0,"I love these bows for my son. I had a hard time finding a solid color bow tie that wasn’t cheap looking. These are adorable and nice! He’s 13 months and I ordered the baby size. It barely fits, so when he outgrows I will purchase more in the child size."
5.0,My husband loves this bathrobe!
5.0,"These shoes are made well, comfortable and stylish.  I have a few pairs and I bought one for my mom who wears a size 9 wide.  They fit her perfectly."
5.0,I should have gotten 2..Great purchase. Great fit.

5.0,"Husband loved it, especially the length."
5.0,This costume is true to size and very comfortable.  I ordered the size I wear in dresses and the fit is perfect.  The stretchy fabric on the bodice is forgiving and I like how the costume is one piece.  The cape is attached.  Very satisfied with it!
5.0,"Looks so cute,  love them"
5.0,Works like a charm! Everyone admires it! Great value and quality. I'm snowcat a stage on my life where not only do I need to take my glasses on and off a lot o loose them! Well no more! I have found the perfect solution!
5.0,My fiancé loves this shirt! Such a great buy!
5.0,Cozy and warm for the cold weather!
5.0,"So I was looking for a necklace for my boyfriend online and came across this necklace set. I knew that i had found the perfect one for him when I saw the cross necklace. I was even more excited to see that a heart necklace was included that I could keep for myself. He has always been super picky making my job of finding him any gift extremely hard, but this necklace looks great and goes with anything he wears. I'm glad I purchased it for him."
5.0,I love these suspenders!  They are high quality and look very sharp on!  They stay where they are supposed to be.  The charcoal gray color I ordered is a gorgeous color!  I highly recommend this set of suspenders!  I received a discount to give my honest opinion.  This made no impact on my review.
5.0,Item was as described and are really nice
5.0,"Lenses snapped right into my Arnette dropouts, Crystal clear with a few days of wear."
5.0,It fits perfectly.  I wear it in the morning when I get up because my back is stiff and I need support before taking my run.  20 minutes and I am right as rain.  Then I wear it when I do deadlifts and squats for support.  I also wear it during walks to get a good sweat going.  Great product.
5.0,Love this have gotten so many compliments! Still ordering all the new and beautiful jewelry every chance I get. I'm sure you will love it too.
5.0,They were a gift for my sister and she loved them very much
5.0,"Love it! So much that I went ahead and purchased a second one for my friends son who asked where I got it. The colors to very slightly between the two of them, but don’t let that put you off. Both are very nice to look at and much better quality than similar ones I’ve purchased on here. These are strong as can be. Definitely a quality item."
5.0,I expected this belt to be your average belt you can pick up at any chain store. However when it came in the mail it was a delightful surprise to see that it was made of way better quality and it was more of a classic look. I must of played with the functionality of the belt for a good 5 minutes because I've never seen a belt like this one before. It slides though just as a zip tie would and has a lever that releases it to remove the belt. There isn't any unsightly holes in the belt Wichita gives the belt a classic appearance when wearing it with a tucked in shirt. The black and silver buckle gives a very business look to any attire and my husband feels confident in his belt because it gives him a since of pride when he wears it because it is made better than a regular belt. I'm just happy my husband enjoys his new belt and love seeing him confident while he works feeling classy while he works. As they always say dress for success and it has gave him a feeling of being successful in just a simple accessory!<br /><br />I got this product at a discounted price in exchange to do product testing on and to provide my honest review.
5.0,Excellent product. Exactly as described. Great seller with expedite shipment.
5.0,Great uniform shoe. I like that I don't have to worry about destroyed shoes laces. Also saves dressing times

5.0,These glasses are very nice and durable. They have an expensive feel to them and they are very comfortable. I love the color and the overall look.
5.0,my  daughter  love  it
5.0,"Yay, I remember these from my childhood and thought, why not?  Seasonal allergy sniffles are a pain.  Perfect size for pocket, no more finding tissue pieces in the washing machine."
5.0,Just perfect fits to my 3 mo son! And I love to dress him up using those side snaps
5.0,Item: Leki Makalu Retro Trekking Poles... I absolutely love this pair of trekking poles. I also ordered the LEKI Rubber Fitness Walking Tip (they also come as a pair). I am pleased with both items.
5.0,The socks were just what I expected. Great quality and perfect for my purpose. They arrived sooner than expected. I have no complaints
5.0,"i highly recommend these chains as a substitute to the the expensive silver and white gold chains. they can easily fool anyone into thinking that you paid hundreds of dollars for what looks like platinum or white gold! but paid a fraction of the cost for tough / rugged stainless steel. purchased 2 and loved them, as of this writing i purchased 2 more. you wont go wrong with these chains they are strong enough to support large crosses and big medallions"
5.0,Super cute! Fit as expected. Loved wearing this on vacation.
5.0,This jacket is bright and comfortable. It has several pockets. I normally wear an X-large and needed an XXL in this jacket.

5.0,Very nice carrying case.  Looks attractive and is protective.  Love it.  Arrived very quickly.
5.0,I bought these earrings to replace another pair of emeralds. The color is fabulous and the casing is top notch. I love the way they look when I wear a green top. Love these.
5.0,Used for a Christmas party. Beautiful dress great material and flattering fit.
5.0,Super comfy jammies.
5.0,This dress was great for halloween.
5.0,"This is a well made and comfortable (according to my daughter) leotard.  It is two pieces, leotard and shorts, not one piece."

5.0,Love these! Style and price for amount!
5.0,Husband loves this!  Durable and soft.
5.0,"Absolutely loved it. Super cute, makes outfits look on point hehe"
5.0,"One of my best purchases! Great shine, perfect length, and very good quality. Very happy....will order more. Wish they came in the next mm size, which would be a different look and go with different attire for different purposes."
5.0,"Wanted an everyday ring that could take the handling of 6 rescue dogs and the volunteer work...which includes being bitten from time to time. My 14 kt gold band was a mess. Looked like it had been through a war+....<br /><br />This is shiny, has some good weight to it but the comfort fit is to die for. Glides on your finger like butter and is the perfect width if your fingers are not as long as nail polish models are.<br /><br />It has that steel grey darker platinum look that is so flattering to all skin tones. I really cannot imagine why anyone would spend money for a gold ring when you can get something this fabulous looking and hard wearing as this ring. It's a real winner and keeper for me ! One of the best jewelry items I have ever purchased !"
5.0,Bought 2 one for me and my daughter and we both love ours
5.0,"Happened to see on someone, they told me they ordered it from Amazon and literally 10 mins later I did the same thing. Love it 😀"
5.0,"just received this bag and immediately love it. love the size, the fabric feel, the strap size is good. full zipper closure. while its full  coverage cat print, its not big therefore not overwhelming. super cute and fun.  i would order a bunch moreso i have back up bags in the future!!!"
5.0,"I bought one a few years back, and used it faithfully.  I had to go to my extra key when the first one's battery was slowly going...but it didn't have one of these. And I couldn't find one ANYWHERE locally this time. Found these and they are the same, with nice colors. Cloth covered plastic which last longer than just plastic wrist key chains. Worth the money too. They arrived fast too."
5.0,"Very cute dress!  I am 5'7&#34; and curvy, it is very flattering and almost hits my knee, just how I like it.  I am buying another one now!"
5.0,"This dress is amazing! The sizing was perfect, it's flattering, comfortable and has that little ommpf of sexiness without being revealing"
5.0,It is a beautiful ring. The gems are sparkly and the engraving was perfect

5.0,My brown shoes never looked better. I gave one container to a friend and still have plenty.
5.0,"This is the first of many I have purchased from different retail & on-line stores, no matter how many times I ordered one it never never ever fit or wore correctly, always to short and never look like a true slouchy; always seemed that the beanies were never manufactured correctly! UNTIL NOW !!!! I can’t believe it has taken me this long to find a slouchy that fits correctly; and IS TRUELY  A SLOUCHY  BEANIE ! I loved this slouchy beanie so much , this one came in a package of two, so I ordered two more packages, just to put away and ordered a couple more for fiends that were having the same issues as I was ! My one buddy got back to me he was like now this is what I am talkin about ; brotHer where did you find this awesome slouchy beanies...he has two I gave for now , but he is also ordering back ups just because it’s the first true fit slouchy we ever found !!! Comfortable, warm when needed ,but also cool with warmer weather ...I wear mine year round ....JT"
5.0,Material is too thin but i love to represent.
5.0,Color is true to photo online and the quality is good. Overall pleased with purchase.
5.0,I just received mine yesterday! Love it! It's pretty small but it's the exact size I wanted! I ordered the pink one and have already had tons of compliments on it.
5.0,"They are amazing! They feel so soft and are super flattering.  I’m 5’11 and these are long on me but I love that, normally leggings are too short."
5.0,It was alittle hard to pop one side in both bands but overall a good replacement.
5.0,"I love this bathing suit!! The color was exactly what I was looking for and the fabric was a good quality so it fit very well. I would err on getting the larger size if you're between two sizes like me, but other than that it was perfect!"
5.0,Perfect! My 10 year old loved it. Comes flat and you simply clasp together into a circle. Wasn't paper like which I was afraid of and didn't break which I was also afraid of. Sturdy and just right.
5.0,"Thicker material, soft and SO comfortable! Would absolutely buy again."
5.0,"I love these! Perfect for the days you don’t have time to style your hair. Just do a messy bun , put on a buff. Quick cute and style’n."
5.0,Perfect...
5.0,I got this for my sister in law for Ren Fest she loves it I'm so happy!
5.0,I love how study it is.  The picture does not give it justice.  A beautiful headband.  Delivery did take a long time.
5.0,Good quality hat
5.0,I love these!! So comfortable and yet so cute!!<br />I want to add that the pockets hang out but I just took a safety pin and pinned the<br />pockets together on the inside so they look and feel normal. Not a major deal. I freakin love them and would wear them everywhere if it wasn’t for my kids eye rolls as I try to wear them everywhere! Haha!
5.0,The young man 'bagging' my groceries said he wished everyone had a shopping box like this one. Easy to fill & carry.<br />Am pleased with this product.
5.0,Easy to put on and take off. Easy for her to put on and take off. Beautiful details. Washed on delicate and dried on delicate with an air fluff. Perfect poof.
5.0,"Direct replacement for my Von Zipper sunglasses, would recommend."
5.0,It could be placebo effect but i feel more grounded when i wear it. Perhaps hematite doing what it does.
5.0,This set of briefs is very comfortable. It feels fine on. It is not too thick. I liked the fabric. It felt very soft. I like that it comes in a set to save money.<br /><br />The quality was good. It washed just fine. It seemed pretty stretchy. It looked fine under the clothing. It had good coverage. I would recommend it.
5.0,Nice hair covering.. great quality
5.0,"This necklace is simply beautiful, elegant and unique.  I love the boldness of the design.  I would suggest wearing it with a solid color outfit because it wouldn't blend with a multitude of colors. Definitely would recommend purchasing."
5.0,Sooooo Awesome
5.0,"Love PattyBoutik. This shirt is well-made, comfortable, and has a nice heavy-weighted fabric. It's a little stretchier/springier and clingier than my other PattyBoutik tops but I still like it a lot. The arm detail is unique and stylish. The neckline is the perfect compromise between a little modest and a little revealing."
5.0,Christmas gift for my wife. She loved it and wears it everyday and at night. People complement the necklace. Worth buying!
5.0,Ima full time professional cosplayer and this cosplay was perfect. I got a size medium. I could have gotten a large if I wanted a tad more space. But I like how it fits like a glove!<br />10/10 would recommend
5.0,Super stretchy and comfortable.  Will purchase again in different patterns.
5.0,My 7 year old son saved his allowance to get his teacher a gift and this is what he chose. His teacher loves it. For such a small price it's a beautiful little bracelet and a moment my son will remember forever.
5.0,"Horgeous! exactly as I expected them to look,"
5.0,Wow! The quality of this dress is beyond what I expected! And I have received so many compliments on it.. will buy the other colors for sure!
5.0,Super cute design. It fits pretty well and comfy too.
5.0,"Super cute shirts! I was hoping they would be a little bit flow-y (they're pretty fitted), but I still love them :)"
5.0,my favorite dress. I walked the streets of Puerto Rico and was comfortable!!
5.0,Very good ! They did the job .
5.0,Used for a costume. Going as a BLU spy from TF2. I had to make cuts into this to get the desired effect but it turned out great. The fabric doesn't rip if you cut it and stays stretchy so it worked perfect.
5.0,Love the outfit and the kiddo loves it
5.0,"Exactly as pictured, the color is perfect. I get compliments every time I wear it!"
5.0,Its super cute and easy to adjust the tail! It was a little tough adjusting the ears but I made it work!

5.0,"Fashionable design, makes it look elegant and it goes well with jeans or dress pants.  Will definitely re order for a gift in the future."
5.0,"I bought a large volume of these for work and was pleasantly surprised with their quality. They have a nice industrial, modern look and good action on the fastener. If you intend to write on the slip of paper that comes with each tag, you're fine, but if you're going to print your own, as I did, be mindful of the unique shape of the metal part; you'll have to trim your paper to fit.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great look and feel<br />- Quality construction<br /><br />Cons<br />- None. Great product!"
5.0,"The thing I love most about yoga pants is how flexible and forgiving on the fitting side for bigger girls like me, but its so annoying to get a good work out in them and then my legs are DRIPPING with sweat after, they don't breathe that well but THESE are the solution! I love them! because they are yoga pants they still fit very well and they are flexible for working out but they are SHORTS so my lower half of my legs are sweat free :) I highly recommend this product to yoga-pant-worker-outers :)"
5.0,"Fits great, looks so professional. Such an incredible deal!"
5.0,"Item was very nice, exceeding expectations."
5.0,Super soft and great quality! Color is perfect.
5.0,"Fits beautiful feels a lot more quality then what your actually paying for, was quite impressed!"
5.0,The kids love these watches. And now they know when to be in the house when they are out playing.
5.0,It was perfect for me as a wallet. It is very well made and will last a very ling time.
5.0,Great deal. No issues
5.0,"Wow, item arrived fast, reasonably priced and I can't get over how good the sound quality is for the price.  Excellent buy."
5.0,These are sooo good for the price !
5.0,"Very versatile, fit well and I love the color!"
5.0,Love our headbands! Such good quality!
5.0,"Runs a bit small, but otherwise, is fitting and comfortable."
5.0,"They're beautiful, just wish I could've gotten them in silver since all my other jewelry is silver."
5.0,"Great wristband.  It looks awesome, feels great, snug and comfortable. Way better than the original band.  Highly recommend this for anyone searching for a wristband that's comfortable, convenient, and that looks awesome."
5.0,"Super stylish, lightweight but polarized excellent sun blocking. Super cute that you can match with your kiddo. Smaller kid version and adult. Excellent quality!! 5 stars."
5.0,"This is a great product for the price, the material is surprisingly soft and does not leave scratches on my glasses.<br />It was also delivered way before the promised date."
5.0,So far so good.  When I first got my Fitbit all I could find was really expensive replacement bands.  I was skeptical about this one but have been pleasantly surprised so far.
5.0,Pretty pretty
5.0,Love it!  Looks amazing for a great price and fits awesome.  I had been wanting a wrap bracelet for a while and this met my expectations.
5.0,Nice wallet...good value. Would buy again.
5.0,"This set was much better quality than I expected for the price, and the fit was better too. I am definitely a pear shape, which I didn't think would work with the style, especially when I compared my measurements to the chart. I usually wear an 8 pants/dress and a small or medium shirt. I ended up with the 42 fitting. I ordered the 44 in another style (the blue checkered dress with a brown apron) from the same company and it was too big, but I liked it enough to order it for Oktoberfest next year.<br /><br />I am not usually an online clothes shopper because I'm hard to fit, but I'm glad I took the chance on this. I love it!"
5.0,"Cute for a lounge dress and that's what I bought it for. I can see you adding some jewelry and wedges to dress it up, but I don't like wearing anything higher than 1.5 inches. I am more of a flatter, comfort sandal, girl. I am 5'6 and this would be too long for that. I purchased the green color and it is a very nice color. The pockets are a nice touch also. I wanted something nice to travel with as I have two big trips coming up, and it will be great to throw-on after my showers, while drinking coffee, etc. Its totally appropriate for that and classy. Its reminds me of a modern mumu without the boxiness."
5.0,This long sleeve shirt was the perfect price.  It comes with a stretchy fabric and it feels very light on your skin.  I would order more in other colors.  Very satisfied.
5.0,This is a great shirt for the gym and I love that it comes with four shirts
5.0,Awesome gloves
5.0,Looks great and the magnet was more than strong enough. Exactly as desired.
5.0,"I just received my glasses!  I am very surprised with them! They came in a nice cases and are very stylish,  which is not really important to me anyway. However, i didnt realize that one of them was a bifocal and it's the best one of all for me!  Nice surprise for me! Mine are clear and easy to clean. I only wish I got them a bit stronger but they are still fine. I have read other people reviews about how cheap they are, but for less than 5.00 each with a coordinating colors cases then go to a dollar store and get one. These are very good for the money. I would not hesitate to get more from this company!"
5.0,I liken the look and it fits perfect.
5.0,"I do not carry a purse with me, as I find them to be annoying. This product is great because I just clip it on with my keys and I have my chapstick handy everywhere I go and I’ll never have to dig for it!"
5.0,Flawless
5.0,"This was just a bit darker than I expected it to be, but I'm able to wear it with outfits that need a slightly darker color than that for which I was originally looking.  I do love this bracelet and it goes well with so many outfits.  It garners a lot of compliments and I'm very pleased with its looks, its construction and quality.  This would make a great gift if your Mom or girlfriend or wife wears colors that will go with this bracelet."
5.0,Love this ring fits a little. Big but looks great and every one likes it buy it
5.0,"I am very pleased with this goggle and swim cap set.  I ordered this for my 10 year old for swim team.  It isn't as high quality as the much more expensive sets you would buy in the store, but it works well.  The goggles are adjustable and work well.  Ear plugs and nose plugs were included but he doesn't use them.  The hat is easy to put on.  It is a rubber material, and it keeps his hair dry without pulling it out.  I think the price of under $10 is great for a full set.  Don't expect a $50 set, but this exceeded my expectations at that price point.  It fits well and works how it should.  Shipping was very fast with amazon prime.  I would recommend both this set and the seller."
5.0,Was a gift. he said he liked them.
5.0,This is a very well made shirt and is exactly what I expected.  It made the perfect birthday gift for my husband.
5.0,My grandmother loves these snap coats
5.0,comfortable and cute!
5.0,I love my new smaller watch band!!
5.0,It's freaking awsome!
5.0,These leggings are amazing.  True to size and the material is so soft.  Love these and planning to order more!!!!
5.0,"I love this little wristlet, it fits my smartphone, money, cigarettes and lighter easily with room for other odds and ends like chapstick.  My only complaint is I wish I got the blue one!  The maroon one isn't exactly what I was expecting but still super cute."
5.0,This is beautiful on!  I love the short sleeves and it is really pretty.  Great purchase!!
5.0,I gave this gift to three different friends and they all loved it.  A little shocked when they first read the message then laughed and said it was perfect.
5.0,"This is very comfortable and flattering. Even though I could stand to lose a bit of weight, I still felt comfortable in it."
5.0,"The dress fit perfectly, true to size. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Neck line is important and it goes up high enough to make my neck look pretty and practical that it covers my neck to keep me warm.  I like that it's long sleeve and not heavy, but thin enough to wear in the warmer weather as well as the colder weather. I like that the back is smooth without any hem line like another one that I saw. For me the jacket sits just above my waist, so it doesn't cut me off. I'm only 5 foot tall and thin, but that makes me look slimmer when it hits just above the waist. I would like that they had more colors.  The blue is beautiful, but i wouldn't have anything to wear it with. And i have no need for white. I would love wine and dark taupe"
5.0,These are superior to any other brands that I have bought.
5.0,"These little studs are small but impactful ~ less is more!  I wear them with other studs in my first and second earring holes.  And I just got my 3rd lobes done too, so they will look super cute alongside other tiny studs"
5.0,This was a gift. Granddaughter loves them.
5.0,Beautiful charm. My favorite of all my charms.
5.0,I would have trouble with rashes under my breasts from sweating. Pambras absorbed the sweat and have solved my problem. Thank you!!!
5.0,"Fast, easy transaction.  Granddaughter loves Moana and is crazy about the shirts!"
5.0,Love the design.
5.0,Very stylish and great quality! With the various sizes you have many options for looks.
5.0,i love this hat.  bought it for my bf but im keeping it and will get him a different one ;)
5.0,Great product! I love the color and price! Plus they look great on me!!
5.0,Made very well.  Love the bottom of these shoes.
5.0,"I absolutely adore this dress!  It is very comfortable and flattering.  I ordered a size up (I normally wear a size 20) and I'm perfectly pleased that I did.  The waist sits in the correct spot for a busty person.  It is VERY long, since I'm only 5 feet tall, but alterations should be simple.  I'll need about 6-8 inches taken off the bottom.  I would definitely purchase it again, and I'm anticipating buying it in other prints and colors."
5.0,"Comfortable dress, I just had surgery and I needed comfortable dresses and this one is very lightweight, I’m 5’6” and this dress is over my knees. It looks good."
5.0,"Winter is officially here and I hate no being able to wear gloves and text at the same time. You have to choose one or the other; keep your hands warm or be able to text or just be able to answer a call. I knew that other products like these have been on the market, but I've never really thought that I would want a pair.<br /><br />After receiving these gloves, which came in very appealing packaging, I'm now sold! 100%! These are classy, stylish and still have the warmth that everyone desires in a good pair of winter gloves. Not that I do a lot of texting while driving - which you never should do, but there are those occasions where you might need to. I'm very happy with this purchase and couldn't have picked better.<br /><br />These fit TTS (true to size) - I'm a medium and they were truly a perfect fit for my hands. I've been wearing them for the last week, twice a day, and they still fit the same as they did the first time I put them on. I did get them wet, and they still look brand new. Very easy to use to text while using them and it's a relief.<br /><br />Honestly, you won't go wrong with these. I'm glad I made the plunge and got them. Even though I did receive a discount for my very honest and unbiased review, I have to say that as far as winter gloves go, these are an A++++."
5.0,"the color of the pictures is not that accurate, but is a nice shirt, good material, for casul wear"
5.0,Really cute dress! I got a lot of compliments and it was super comfortable! Perfect for the summer.
5.0,"I wore this for an 8 hour shift today and let me tell you, it stays put! It doesn’t itch, I didn’t sweat. It didn’t slide up when I lifted my arms. I felt comfortable literally all day! Didn’t even really notice I had it on. The straps stay in place and you tighten them from the front which I love!<br />The bra comes with an extension in case it is too tight around the rib cage and I did have to use that but it’s so convenient that the company sends that with the bra!<br /> I’m normally a small and ordered a small. Considering it comes with an extension i wouldn’t size up.<br />I would order a million of these! My favorite bra ever!"
5.0,I love the fit.  Not overly hugging or binding.  Waist is so so comfortable !  Just what I wanted in a legging right now. Perfect fabric. Soft and stretchy  The Capri length is trending right now under Aline skirts n things!  I bought 3 colors and I’m so happy!!
5.0,"Excellent, fit good, real colors"
5.0,"Although, I would prefer a higher quality fabric like organic cotton, hemp or tencel, I still love it."
5.0,Very light weight and comfortable.
5.0,Adorable and soft stretchy fabric! This is a good one to get!
5.0,Ditto!! I got two Zeta stocking & third one.<br />Thank you
5.0,"This mouse pad is a really good deal at $8. It's huge, not overly padded but still thick, and very smooth. My boyfriend does use it to play video games and likes it a lot better than the one he used to use. He needs speed for his gaming and doesn't have any issues. The design looks just like the picture and we are more than happy with the purchase. I did receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unpaid review and will update if my experience with the pad changes over time."
5.0,Ack! Sooo soft! Adorable and wonderful to wear all night!
5.0,excelente gorra me encanta
5.0,"EDIT: I still use this bag every single day. Everything about is has been holding up GREAT, except for the little magnetic ring around the front pocket that holds the flap down, has gone missing. It simply fell off somewhere and I didn't notice until it was too late.<br /><br />Also, the back zipper that was 'getting stuck', has finally ripped and become unusable. Other than that is has held up great! Still would recommend.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Very solid looking bag, rugged yet classy. I got the Army Green bag and it works great for my uses.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Plenty of pockets to choose from, one in the way back, one up front on the flap, one on the side. When you open it up it has a ton of room plus another pocket with a zipper.<br />- Sturdy<br />- Lots of loops to hook keys to, if needed<br />- Adjustable shoulder sling strap as well as an adjustable clasp on the front, securing the flap closed.<br />- Flap has a strong magnet to keep it secure.<br />- The inside, itself is a big pocket, with a zipper to keep things inside. (just in case you drop or tip it upside down)<br />- Looks GREAT!<br />- Not too heavy, even when it's filled with things and stuff.<br /><br />Cons<br />- The outside, back zipper is getting stuck, randomly. (probably because it's the one thing that's constantly being pushed up against my body, moved around and has a lot of pressure on it. Which I wasn't too upset about because I never use that pocket.)<br /><br />All in all I think this bag is awesome. I'm glad I found it and I get a lot of compliments on it. ;)"
5.0,🔥 literally such a good fit i own every color lol.
5.0,Love these earrings only complaint is the backs fall off. I just bought rubber ones and they work perfect.
5.0,Really fine quality at a bargain price!
5.0,I purchase this for myself and it fit nice and comfortable and I am a small.
5.0,Purchased for a boys cosplay he is happy
5.0,You honestly can't tell the difference in the two and I have a real one this is an excellent buy and I bought more ☺️🦋
5.0,Nicely made great packaging
5.0,"I wasn't thrilled when I pulled this top/dress out of the package, but it's grown on me and now I love it.<br /><br />It has the funky, boho style I expect from Mordenmiss.  I'm 5'9&#34; tall, and the dress hits me just below the knee.  I wear all these dresses with leggings, so the length is just fine.<br /><br />I really wasn't thrilled with the fabric at first; it's a jerseyish knit, very lightweight, and I thought it felt kind of cheesy.  Then I realized that just about all the Mordenmiss garments I own (and by now, that's a LOT of them) are made of very heavy, thick fabric, from sweatshirt weight fleece, to thick knits.  It's nice to have a MM dress to wear in warmer weather.  The dress looked like a plaid in the picture, but it's more of a check.  The green is vibrant, but very pretty.  This'll definitely be my St. Paddy's Day ensemble next year!<br /><br />The cut is generous, and the dress has just enough tailoring that it doesn't look like a sack on.  This is my very favorite clothing brand and this dress didn't let me down."
5.0,Nice wall item
5.0,This is very classy and just what I was looking for. Love it!
5.0,Very soft. Good quality and stitching. Fits as expected.
5.0,Stance socks are the best! We patronize this brand because they last so long and our son's love the patterns. This pair was purchased for our middle schooler who is 11 years of age. He wears a size 4-4.5 in shoes and the large size in boys Stance fits him perfectly. We highly recommend this brand. They wash and dry great. No shrinkage. Materials used are of high quality. Very popular socks for boys & girls. They come in all different sizes from toddler to men's & women's. The patterns are really fun. These socks are all my boys wear. Thanks Amazon for making them available!
5.0,I have had other tips of cut of shirts but these ones are the most comfortable ones I have ever worn Love them.
5.0,"love it!  Works great for my running shoes, sketchers, etc."
5.0,"These are GREAT.  I bought one for my rain gear to try and ensure the size was correct.  It was so good that I bought 2 more for packing clothing.  I used these for a back country hunting trip; organization was much easier and pack was more compact.  The small size fit socks, underwear, and t-shirts for 5 days.  Construction is quality, straps are quality, light weight... great!  Highly recommend!"
5.0,Very cute! Stays on her feet as she is still learning to walk.
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this necklace - it's fun, sweet and whimsical. Nice quality.<br />Makes me smile."
5.0,"Such a cool shirt. I love the design, and the fabric is super soft"
5.0,Sexy dress. Fit was good.
5.0,"These are comfortable to wear, bright colors, and have a third layer of cloth over the moth and nose for extra protection."
5.0,Exactly as expected.  Not just kind of see through when wet.  Totally see through when wet if you get white or yellow.  Feels great regardless.  You can get away with a dark color (I got blue) on a public beach but it is still bold.
5.0,These are great. They fit and feel great on.  Very trendy look!
5.0,my new favorite flannel! buying more...<br />high quality flannel. nice fit
5.0,I ga e it to my daughter. It fits petite
5.0,This is just like the polishing cloth I have purchased from James Avery and works great.
5.0,got these for friends and they all loved them
5.0,I got an extra small and I absolutely love it. I’ve gotten compliments on it every single time I’ve worn it. It dresses anything up
5.0,Bought this for a CHRISTmas party and LOVE it!!! Had several compliments on it!! If you’re looking for class but not quite elegant this is your dress!! It’s classy and can easily be dressed up or down! Love that it has pockets to hold what little you might need without taking a purse in. I plan on wearing to to a Valentines dinner as well!! I normally wear a med and large in dresses depending on how they are made but after reading the reviews I ordered an XL and it fit great! I may could have used a Large but a smidge looser was great! I’m 5’2 and 165 lbs and  36DD if this helps anyone. Would definitely buy again!
5.0,"This Belt is cool! It looks good, it adjusts much more than a conventional belt, and you can cut it to size over and over as you lose weight!"
5.0,Awesome shorts super fast drying great for water parks
5.0,Perfect for my ivory/champagne wedding dress!
5.0,I am so in love with this ring!! My husband bought this band to go with it and the set is stunning!!
5.0,I was pleased with these flip ups. I've used them for driving and trap shooting. On bright days they darken the sky and the orange clay birds stand out better.
5.0,Beautiful bought for my parents they loved them
5.0,Very nice fabric. Good quality and very cozy. I love it!
5.0,It's exactly like the picture. I absolutely love it it is perfect for me can't wait to show it off.
5.0,"This is a lovely snap, my granddaughter loved it"
5.0,"I'm 5'3 and normally wear a size 6, but I had to exchange this for the large size. Otherwise, it's a simple product at a great price. It was a little tight on my thighs, but it helped me complete my first sprint tri with short transition times.  The pockets in the back are perfect for a car key or fuel and the pad is just enough for the bike. Beware, there's no compression or support, so you'll need a sports bra for under this."
5.0,"Hands down my favorite dress. It fits perfectly on me. I got a size small. I'm 5'3 and around 105 pounds for your reference. It's very flattering around the waist. The floral pattern is really pretty. The only downside is that the dress is just a tad sheer, even with the built-in slip, but that can easily be fixed by wearing another pair of shorts or something under it. It's just too gorgeous of a dress."
5.0,I love the fit and the blue color is fashionable. Keeps me from straining my eyes in the sun. I use them often
5.0,Not sure what the other reviewer thinks that shell is... but this is very clearly shell and it's super cute! The stone is not metal in any way.
5.0,Pardon my morning hair I just received these they fit nice over my glasses. I walk dogs all day and it's nice to have eye protection.. They say in the ad UV protection but there is NO sticker saying the sun glasses are.. Hope they really are for my eyes sake.. I like that I got 2 pair since I lose mine all the time..
5.0,"So, I really love these shirts, but if the wind is blowing to hard you might want to wear a tank top underneath because the bottom of the shirt will flip up. Other than that they are very comfortable, stretchy, and smooth. They have pockets on the sides, you could even put dress weights In the pockets during windy days so the shirt doesn't flip up."
5.0,"Been wanting this shirt since I was a teen. The subway style version of this Bad Brains shirt can be difficult to find, but this shirt is the true &#34;subway&#34; style. The design fits the whole front of the shirt, just as the picture shows. Looks great, fit looks about right, maybe a tad smaller than expected for a men's size medium, but I am ok with that. Glad I finally bought the shirt."
5.0,Product was easy to use. Perfect for bending/shaping metal bracelets.
5.0,3 days before we left for our Disney trip I decided to order 30 pins (for only $30) for my girls to trade. What a deal! They were delivered less than 48 hours later and actually had some great pins in the mix that my girls kept instead of trading! It was such a savings and my girls were thrilled!
5.0,I bought this for my hubby. It looks so hot on him. The slim fit is perfect. Just remember the sizes are international so you need to purchase the US size of you are in the US.
5.0,I like the mask and the detailing. Really great quality. My only con is that it's heavy. It's not made of plastic...more like a ceramic kind of material so it makes it feel heavy on the face.
5.0,Loved these mock turtlenecks.
5.0,My wife looks amazing in them
5.0,Really cool socks
5.0,Great value. Flattering and slimming fit! Get tons of compliments. Only downfall is sheer material. Got the navy color & you cannot see through it. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0,Mama likes it. Warm. Soft. Well made.
5.0,Love! Love! Love it!!!♥️♥️♥️
5.0,"I found I was allergic to the bands that cem with my Charge5 Fitbit. I looked for an alternative and found this leather band. I originally ordered it in pink from another company and it never arrived. I found your company and ordered from you. It arrived on ti,e and looks great. I will be ordering other colors."
5.0,"Love the rich red. Love the super wide straps that don't dig in and haven't fallen down my arm either. I appreciate the wide back band as well as the wider than usual front band (underbust) area.<br /><br />I am typically a US 42-44 C. I ordered a 46c/d because, as we all know, Asian sizes are markedly small than US sizes. The 46c/d fits me without the extender."
5.0,"I didn't notice that this was a children's hat when I placed my order and when I tried it on I was surprised that it fit me perfectly!<br />I ordered it to wear under my cycling helmet and because it is fitted and not a thick material it works perfectly.<br />I am so happy.  AND , it's lightweight so it is not hot in the summer sun.  I want one in every color.  LOL !"
5.0,Fits heads of all sizes. This is a lot of fun!
5.0,"I love the height, they go up about 3 inches from my ankle or just under where my calf begins (I have a 32&#34; inseam). Socks are cool (literally), wick sweat and durable (had them 2 years and still no thinning in the heel or toe). Though I don't have a lot of neon green shirts to match they add the pop and ironic statement to my set up that I've always thought it was missing."
5.0,Great for a light snowboarding layer
5.0,Such a cute hoodie! It’s more of a shirt because it’s pretty thin . But super cute!
5.0,"Fit perfectly, not bulky, no uncomfortable bunching."
5.0,So unique and original!
5.0,Amazing product. The first picture is the first watch strap I bought. Theres nothing wrong with it other than being a little worn. I've had the first one longer than a year and a half. I decided I wanted another in a darker color and its just as good as the first one. I definitely reccomend this strap.
5.0,these were a little bigger than i thought.  someone else would probably like them better than me. there was nothing wrong with them.
5.0,Love everything.<br />The only thing I would change is to put a small bottom in it like 2 inches<br />Thx
5.0,Absolutely love these. I was looking for fairly low cost plus size overalls that didn't have too many rips/a destroyed look. These are super comfy and seem to be made out of fairly durable denim for the price point. I recommend ordering up 1-2 sizes depending on how you want them to fit
5.0,Love the fit!!!! I'm 6 feet tall and the leggings stretch down to my ankles. Will also fit shorter people - just pull the leg fabric up a bit and they will fit fine. The waist sits at my waist and I dont have to keep pulling them up. They stay in place and fit snugly with no bagging yet are not too tight. I have 8 designs and ordered more! First time I've ever found beautiful print leggings that are long enough for me. Love them!!!!
5.0,Such a cute outfit! So flattering!! Love it!
5.0,"I like,it because  its really  pretty and it sticks out there it's nice and pretty necklace"
5.0,"Top Quality key and credit card case. Plenty of room for everything. Double snaps for a good fit. Very well made, easy to use. Great."
5.0,"These boots were a gift for our granddaughter. We bought her this brand last year and they have stood up through almost daily wear.  So far, we are pleased with this new pair."
5.0,So soft. So very comfortable
5.0,Wanted a non-underwire style bra and this works well.
5.0,Can’t add a video
5.0,Good quality metal and looks really cool when wearing them in both my nostril piercings
5.0,"Perfect for my wallet that i just got, and the delivery was super fast!"
5.0,"So I ordered these because my other long pants for camping had a couple of holes in them.  I must say... these are DURABLE.  I went cave exploring for 3 days over the weekend, and normally always get some pants that eventually get holes in them when I go out there.  I wore these all 3 days, climbing inside caves, army crawls, etc, and they have ZERO holes in them.  I even hit my right knee 3 different times while climbing, and the pants really protected me each time.  If they had ripped, I would have been bleeding instead of just bruised.<br /><br />DEFINITE BUY"
5.0,Lightweight statement earrings.
5.0,Beautiful scarf....gorgeous colors and so soft!!
5.0,"I love these small hoops with a secure fastening back that doesn't snag or pop open unexpectedly. I love these and would order another pair for my multi pierced ears. They are super comfortable, I shower and sleep in them."
5.0,"Definitely worth it for the price! They are smaller than I expected, which was a good thing for me."
5.0,"Loved how sparkly it was , bought two"
5.0,"Basic, cute summer dress. Wore over bathing suit on a cruise. It served its purpose."
5.0,This dress is absolutely adorable! Very lightweight and comfortable. It just skims your body and is very flattering. I ordered 2 more in different patterns. They are stylish and comfy.
5.0,Perfect Fit.
5.0,Super cute high wasted. Roomy. Material is nice. Order size small. 5’6” 130lbs
5.0,I love this sweatshirt so comfy!
5.0,there is nothing to say but Awesome Quality
5.0,This is a very versatile charm bead.  It is beautifully crafted and I can't wait to collect all of the dark blue Galaxy charms from NinaQueen.
5.0,"Love this ring. My brother in law calls this my tin foil ring, since it is So shiny. But I love it because it goes with so many things that are also shiny. If you are expecting any shades of black on this ring, it is not there. So when you pick this, wear it with shiny silver jewelry and you will love it."
5.0,"Be careful with younger babies. I put this on my daughter’s head & fold the top half back then tighten. This helps to make sure it’s not too tight on her head, & stops it from falling down. Also, if your child is a curious one then be VERY cautious with leaving them unattended with this on. My daughter will grab it & pull it over her face. She doesn’t do it as much anymore so I guess she had to get used to it. I just felt that was important to say. I love this product & love that it can stay with her as she continues to grow."
5.0,"A little expensive, but comfortable burnout tank.  Great for CrossFit."
5.0,Came earlier than I expected and looks amazing!!!
5.0,Chain is great!  Amazon deicery completely sucks the last 20 plus packages getting shoved back 2 weeks from promised next day delivery.  Why do I pay for prime membership again?!
5.0,Exactly as expected ! Go up in a size if you'd like a tad bit more coverage because they are cheeky ! Stay true to size if your trying to flaunt the booty ! Lol
5.0,Great value. Have ordered twice
5.0,Super cute earrings. These are perfect for my daughter. She loves simple small earrings and these are absolutely perfect. They ha ent changed in color and are high quality. I am super pleased.
5.0,nice but too small for my face. frame is very thick. returned
5.0,"Lovely watch! The only surprise is the band is very large & not adjustable. It sits further up my arm than I'd like, but it's okay. Getting compliments!"
5.0,So this dress looks like it could be Bebe or similar! It is t cheapy thin Halloween costume material! It's definitely worth the money. My measurements are 5'5 36ddd-29-40 and the large is great.
5.0,"For the price, these shorts are awesome!! I am so impressed with the feel of the fabric and the fit. They don't roll up and they are ""squat proof"". Such a great find. I bought four colors."
5.0,Work as advertised.  Most excellent.
5.0,Husband liked so much he bought a second pair
5.0,42 H Bust  and got an XL
5.0,I found this beautiful key for my granddaughters graduation from college.  She has the key to her future with her degree and I am reminding her with the necklace.  It is just perfect.
5.0,"Needed something really fast that looked good and was inexpensive, this was it. Gold tone wasn’t brassy and the pearls looked good with the layered look I was going for."
5.0,I love this top..It fits great .I wear a size lg/xlg. And I bought a large..the fit is perfect and it looks good on.
5.0,Husband loves it.  Its exactly what you would expect from a throw.  Not super thick or thin.  Great colors.  Does its job well.
5.0,"One of the best qualities at a great price, I've been using them for a few weeks and there's nothing wrong to say about this watch bands. Colors are solid and perfect fit."
5.0,I love this hat. It fits perfect and didn't have to adjust it at all. Perfect buy. I needed a hat to block the sun for the summer that for my style and this worked great.
5.0,I like these so much I've got four pairs all located in convenient places. Nice dark lenses. Surprisingly sturdy considering how light they are. I have both clip-ons and clip and flip. I prefer the latter.
5.0,I usually wear a 2x and I went up a size and fits comfortable. Material is nice and you can wear for any occasion.
5.0,he looked adorable in it.
5.0,Was exactly  what I expected.  Very pleased.  Will make a nice Christmas present
5.0,"If I have to wear a mask, this will be what I wear from now on.  I'm sick of smothering in the other types of masks.  I'm sick of foggy glasses, although I'm sure these will probably end up fogging up glasses like the others.  But sooo much easier to breath with this type than the others.  A big plus is the ability to leave it around your neck as a scarf.  No more forgetting my mask in the car and running back for it."
5.0,So fun!  Much larger than I thought
5.0,Love the bigger size!  It is a larger than normal scarf.  That is what I wanted.  It is also very warm.  Bought as a gift and she really likes it.
5.0,This is the perfect fit for my son.
5.0,Fit perfect no alterations needed. Loks very chic and beautiful
5.0,They are so comfy I ever go to store with them on. They are great indoor out door slippers
5.0,A gift for my mom. And she loved it
5.0,"Long top, fits great. One of my favorite ones so far."
5.0,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The fabric is soft and washes well. The lace doesn't curl up after being washed and it's soft as well. May buy the short sleeved one for the summer months.
5.0,"It has a loose, cozy fit. The material is soft and warm."
5.0,The socks are very cute on my 1 year old daughter.

5.0,hmmm...maybe I should leave 'em off 😯
5.0,Pretty high quality and fit around my thighs well without riding up too much.
5.0,Waiting on the perfect dress to wear this with!
5.0,Great nose rings! Great deal for the price!
5.0,My daughter loved this costume! Comfortable and fit just right!
5.0,I have 2 teens and I am using these bags as reusable gift bags!  I put their gifts into it and give them the bag.  It always gets a big smile!  Then the kids give me the bags back in a day or so and I put them away for next time.  I no longer waste money on paper gift bags!!
5.0,"I have ordered 4 of these sweaters.  I love them!  They are good staples to add to your wardrobe.  The fit, quality, price and color are all great!"
5.0,Love my new sunglasses case!
5.0,Bought these when I started having circulation issues in my pregnancy. They are super comfortable and worked really well. Great quality and result
5.0,I bought several different but similar sweaters/shrugs and this was the keeper.
5.0,"I LOVE THESE LEGGINGS. FITS LIKE A DREAM!!! as a girl with a big bottom half, I can never find leggings that aren’t see thru. these are<br />Perfect!!!!!!!"
5.0,This lightweight jack is surprisingly warm and is exactly what I need.
5.0,Love it for the classroom and traveling Teacher's Aide
5.0,I am so tired of one size hats that are too small for my natural hair. This one is perfect whether I wear a ponytail or have my hair loose! Thank you!! And the color and fabric are so flattering. I hat is very well made. I plan to add more colors now that I’ve tried this
5.0,I am in love with this dress! I was nervous on sizing since a lot of reviewers say it runs large. I'm glad I went with an XL because I feel like the waist would be too tight in a L. The XL is a little big on the bust but nothing a pin and some tape won't fix. A cardigan looks really cute. I'm very happy with this purchase!
5.0,"I am very pleased with this item. Though it is a bit larger than I expected, it is still beautiful and wearable. The picture does not do it justice in anyway. The adjustable cord is wonderful. Overall, this will not disappoint you."
5.0,My daughter earned an amazon gift card threw her dentist and she got this ring and absolutely  loves it...
5.0,"Nice colors, good width, keep sweat out of my eyes. I found these colors to be the ones I wear most so the color-pack works well for me"
5.0,8 year old Grandson loves it
5.0,"I traveled for 6 weeks in Asia over the summer, staying in a total of 5 different hotels, travel via bullet train, plane, automobile, and boat. This NEVER let me down. It held all my clothes nicely (except for my one outfit I always kept in my seperate backpack.......Summer in Asia is humid and mid day changes are sometime required). I love that this has the garmet bag section in the bag that comparable products do not offer as I was traveling for work a portion the time, I did have to place a few blazers and dresses into the garmet section. I also love that there is no need to unpack. By rolling your clothes and placing them into the indivual sections, you truly are able to get a nice amount of items in each section. As such, this probably would NOT work well for someone who is able to be a &#34;backpack traveler&#34; as it did take up the majority of my 21 inch suitcase minus room for toiletries and a couple books and a pair of shoes.  I was able to clip this directly onto the closet hanging bar. I highly recommend this product. I plan to purchase many for gifts soon!"
5.0,I have received lots of compliments. The wood look is nice and shiny.
5.0,So far I have use this glasses & found no issues so far. I enjoy wearing it it feel comfortable on my face & it helps me to see much better drive at night. I am not going to say that it is a 100% glare free. But it much better than what I am use to & for that I am very grateful.
5.0,I received the wrong size.  I ordered a medium and received an extra large.  The quality and the print is great and looks just like the picture.  I am returning the xl and have reordered the medium.
5.0,perfect for pirate themed bachelorette party i went to
5.0,"My Casio G Shock watch band was solid Plastic (?) Rubber(?) but was causing a rash on my wrist.  I like the watch but Casio, like many watches will not accept the standard two-piece band, SO... You must purchase the adaptor which attaches to the two side pins (that holds the old watch band) and then you purchaser a NATO watch band.  I had no idea what a NATO Band was, but it is simple.  It is a one-piece band that weaves under the adaptors and under the watch.  Perhaps the NATO military uses this type of band that will not come off of your wrist in heavy use.  Little tool allows you to unhook the pins and take of the old bands.  Then reattach the two adaptors with the original pins or use the two supplied. Now thread the new band (This is another purchase and there are many to choose from.).  My eyesight is not that great, but it took me maybe 10 minutes. New Band is great!!!"
5.0,These earrings are absolutely beautiful!  I love the angel/wing theme.  They are on the smaller side but they are packed with glittery sparkle!  They appear to be more expensive than they actually are.  I highly recommend that you get the BERRICLE Cubic Zirconia CZ Angel Wings Womens Fashion Pendant Necklace 18&#34; as well....such an amazing set when paired together!  Don't hesitate...buy now!
5.0,Both my grandsons put their's on right away and loved the design and material.
5.0,Exactly what i ordered. Great product.
5.0,"This watch is great, I love the way it looks and it seems to be fairly durable (haven't worn it enough to say for sure, but resists scratches) it is however DEFINITELY not 45mm wide.  The watch is a good bit smaller than I was expecting. I have to agree with other sources that list it as about 42mm with a 22mm band. Edit: I've put this on a NATO strap and it is now easily one of my favorite watches."
5.0,Bought this for my dad and he works in thought conditions that consists of a lot of cement<br />It’s lasted him very long
5.0,These are perfect to label our band gear bags and cases. They are nice for shows with multiple bands and gear stacked everywhere. We can always spot our stuff even in the dark. I would imagine they are good for luggage as well.
5.0,"If you are considering this purchase, and live somewhere with cool weather, go ahead and go for it.  This is a BEAUTIFUL, soft, vibrant, very well made scarf!  I absolutely love it!  It is thick and definitely for cold weather."
5.0,Great Costume! My son received so many compliments.
5.0,Soft and comfortable. I love it
5.0,"As headline says. Totally Legit. Not some cheap plastic crap. Not real gold obv, but its heavy and has that authentic feel it should have. Came with a zip up protector bag with a red smoking skull on it, and has the rattlesnake skin on the back side. Very happy with this! Just have for any Stone Cold fan!"
5.0,Look great and don't hurt my head.
5.0,"I cannot yet vouch for their durability, but for comfort and pricing I am very pleased. Personally I'd like the small to be a tad smaller; but hey, manufactured goods can't be perfect for everyone."
5.0,True to size and very comfortable. I love the beautiful colors and the very best part is it has pockets!
5.0,Super soft and flowy! My little one loved it!
5.0,comfortable material
5.0,good quality. look excellent! Love it!
5.0,"It's a nice quality had and very cute but this style just didn't look good on me. I'm not a hat person, never have been but recently had 2 facial surgeries to remove basil cell carcinoma and decided I need to start wearing a hat to protect my face."
5.0,These are amazing!  Almost to big!  The sparkle is real!  Great buy for the money!
5.0,"6'3"", 215 lbs, ordered XL.  Suggested I order a large and likely could have gone either way and both would look great.  XL is still form fitting and looks great.  Dress arrived clean with good stitching.  Double layer makes this dress not sheer and safe to wear anywhere.  Looks great stretched to slightly above the knee or hiked up mid thigh.  Highly recommended to be all the sexy you want to be!"
5.0,"Oh my God!  I have had so many jeans not fit me, I didn't want to get my hopes up.  I have a 26&#34; waist and 37&#34; hip/butt and every other pair always had a huge gap in the back.  I hated sitting down as it would show my butt crack.  I couldn't wait to try them on.  These fit like a dream!  Just enough room to wiggle them over my widest area and the hidden draw string closes the gap.  I love that these are boot cut.  I am never comfy in skinny jeans that pinch and pucker.  They are soft like advertised.  They are not sweat pants (believe me, I wear a few of those).  Not gonna sleep in them but great for lounging in and casual workplaces.  Fingers crossed they hold up long term.  They seem well made so if they hold up I will be replacing all my jeans with these."
5.0,Muy bonito.
5.0,"Well made, fits as described, and comfortable dress. I would buy again. Highly recommend."
5.0,Breezy
5.0,True to size and beautiful!
5.0,For what I need and for what I use this is perfect beautiful freaking watch
5.0,"This is a great bag.  It's a little big if you are petite like me but it's very lightweight.  Not sure what they did differently but their pockets are actually super functional in comparison to other diaper bags.  Love the front pockets for wallets and keys.  The side pockets are perfect for sippy cups.  Since they are on the sides, prevents the cups from spilling in your bag which saves me a few freak outs on a weekly basis.  The changing pad is really light so it doesn't weigh down the bag and the strap is perfect length for either wearing like a purse or hanging on a stroller.  Haven't used the media pocket yet but think it's an awesome idea. Oh and the price point is great.  the biggest mistake I made with my first kid was spending an absurd amount on a diaper bag.  This will basically be a trash can that hangs off your body ladies, go for value!"
5.0,We had one before but we bought a new car so we had to get a new Vader!!
5.0,"I'm 5' 7&#34; and a size 16/18 and took a chance buying the size XXL this based on the reviews, and it fits perfectly.  It sits comfortably high waist without sliding down or pinching and falls around three or four inches above my knee, which is the right length for me. The fabric is lightweight without being see-through, as well. I'm very satisfied with this skirt."
5.0,Bellísima y 100 por ciento recomendado!!!!
5.0,Received from Gearbest for $62. Mine came with Citizen/Miyota Automatic Movement. Some people previously received with Seiko NH36 “hacking” Automatic Movement. Fit and finish and quality surpasses any expectations I had for this Watch. Accurate within +20 secs/day. Highly recommend.
5.0,At first inspection these are really cool.  My daughter loves them.  We only tried a few so far but they all worked and the lights are bright.
5.0,I usually wear a small or medium followed the size chart and ordered a large fits perfectly.  It's a very nice top 😁
5.0,"great color and design, nice quality."
5.0,"I've written and illustrated a series of ""UnFROGetable"" picture books for elementary age children that are sold on Amazon.com. When I make an author visit a classroom these are the perfect socks to wear. Children love my frog earrings, pins etc. and now I have socks that will fit perfectly with my costume. Someone once said, ""What separates us from the wild beasts is we accessorize."""
5.0,Fits just like it should! Looks just like the picture. Good quality material! Love it!
5.0,Materials soft and stretch. Fits well.
5.0,The colors are vibrant and the quality of the scarves is awesome for the money paid.
5.0,"In past, I have bought bras of this same nature and the padding always comes out or adjusts when washed.  Not with these!  They do not move, are super comfortable, and it is a great price with a great variety of colors.  I would buy from this seller again."
5.0,great looking hat. well made.
5.0,Just perfect.
5.0,Son loved being Sebastian the crab as part of our little mermaid themed Halloween<br /><br />Quality product that should be able to be passed down/worn again
5.0,Very cute and in what i think is good quality. Just a little bigger in the top area
5.0,This is the second time I’ve purchased this necklace. It’s an awesome statement necklace and it goes with everything. It’s durable and super cute. It takes a little while before it starts to tarnish
5.0,Great shoe. I've bought them in 3 different colors now. They arrived 4 days earlier than expected.
5.0,It is a cuff watch that was inexpensive.  I have really small wrists and every watch that I buy that is not a cuff watch I have to have links taken off.  With the cuff watch you just snap it on and go.  I wish I would have thought of cuff watches years ago.  I love the rose gold color of the watch too.
5.0,The person I bought this for love this dresz
5.0,"I am very excited about giving this hoodie to my daughter. The material is strong and high quality, the picture is bright and colorful, and the hoodie is the correct size. I am very pleased."
5.0,works as advertised and easy to recharge.
5.0,Great quality. Very nice gold color.
5.0,"I love the clarity of the Prince 1999  album cover mask. The fabric soft and comfortable.<br />Since wearing a mask is apart of daily life now, if the mask had a red backside ( similar to the letters on the back of the  album) that would make it bit easier to keep clean and not look dingy.  After all this is PRINCE!!"
5.0,Very supportive!  Fit great and a very appealing bra.  The design is beautiful.
5.0,It was perfect.  My granddaughter just turned 8 and was part of her Birthday present.  She loves that movie and all the characters. She also knows all the songs by heart.

5.0,Fits good! Looks good
5.0,Nice light frames that are extremely flexible and look great.

5.0,Love the fabric super soft

5.0,grandkid like them really well
5.0,"I love this skirt. I’m normally a size 26 but because this brand tends to run large, I decided to size down. I’m glad I did. Hits me just below my knees. A line style. Snag fit at waist . Kinda think material so no see through situation. Great buy"
5.0,Excellent choice.
5.0,"I received this as a present from a co-worker/friend.  It is well made and looks very classy.  I am in agreement with most other posters, that this could be a better chain, but it will work for now.  The packaging was nice.  Love the little tag on it that says &#34;wish&#34;.  I wasn't sure if I would wear it, as I wear a &#34;mother&#34; necklace everyday, but it is super cute with it since this one is on a longer chain.  I can hardly wait to show her in person next month!"
5.0,Fits real good.
5.0,My Granddaughter really loves her new boots! Perfect fit!
5.0,"I used my purchase of five necklaces for my sisters, as we honored my dad for his home going funeral services. The piece was beautiful. It showed beautiful as representation of him as a navy veteran."

5.0,"Just what I wanted.  Soft and stretchy, with a little bit of weight to it.  Hangs nicely.  Very comfortable. Lace is NOT scratchy."
5.0,My father-in-law saw a commercial for another brands slippers like these. When looking they were crazy expensive. So I found these on amazon and they are VERY close to the others but way more affordable.  Every time I see him he stills says how much he loves these shoes. They are super padded and comfortable.
5.0,Creepy!!
5.0,"I get a lot of compliments on these glasses, and they do the job perfectly."

5.0,Very nice fitting
5.0,Bought this for me daughter and I love it. She just had her hair braided with beads and she tends to be bothered a bit by the beads when she’s asleep. This seems to keep things in place and she’s not quite as fidgety when asleep. Good stuff.
5.0,"Really nice design, good fabrics.."
5.0,I use these for my keys and badge access card. I gave some out to friends also.

5.0,stand out very well
5.0,Enjoy them
5.0,Gorgeous dress. I plan to wear for my engagement photos in a few weeks.

5.0,"Sexy and sturdy and I love them!,"
5.0,I bought these for my mother to use while on bed rest following surgery.  The material is very comfortable and bouncy.  I’ve washed it and put it in the dryer.  It had no shrinkage and looks new.  The material is high quality which surprised me based on the price.

5.0,Quality was good.
5.0,Great buy awesome look.
5.0,"&#34; Received the Prottoni Premium Garment Bag within the designated time.  It appears to be a very nice bag and quite durable.  I especially like the rings for hanging the hangers within the bag, and the built in hook.  The zippered pockets appear to be large enough for my son-in-law's dress shoes.  It was given to him as a gift. &#34;"
5.0,"Very cute and practical, nice alternative to all square with the rounded edge, style matches my davinci crib perfectly but color is just slightly lighter, I’m fine with it since it’s clearly its own Piece but if you want it identical I’d stay with the square davinci"
5.0,"Love the price, great for a gift"
5.0,Love how it fits
5.0,"I wear a small, ordered a large because the write-up said to do that and they sent an extra-large which I really like. I think maybe that's best because I'm planning to wear it in hot weather and on the beach so it's better if it's not clingy. The jacket is light and airy and the fabric looks really nice."
5.0,I didn't want a bulky Hoodia so I decided to try this and am very happy with this purchase. True to size.
5.0,Had this wallet for 3 years now and I have been happy with it the whole time! Perfect for a front pocket so you are not sitting on a thick wallet all day.<br />No complaints!
5.0,This was very helpful to keep the mess of cutting hair more manageable.
5.0,wish there were more shirts in the pack
5.0,Cool piece of jewelry.
5.0,Pretty and functional :)
5.0,Bought this for my son to wear for his baseball games and now he wears it everyday!
5.0,"These pants have the perfect fit and also have plenty of flexibility so I can move and bend when I am working outside or camping.  I am adjusting to the pockets since I am used to big, baggy cargo pockets but, because of the snug fit, the pockets  don't sag or bag.  Still plenty roomy though."
5.0,Is not what I really spected but It worth the money. The hammer head Its seems to be a little bended but Its ok for a toy.
5.0,I’m going to be buying more in multiple colors. These are so soft and comfortable. They are long but I love the length.
5.0,"These shades are AWESOME!!! Packed well, built well and fit well!!!"
5.0,I loved this on my daughter fit perfectly she has 2 others like this i definitely recommend
5.0,"just received this, and it is not Sandalwood at all.....it is made of plastic beads like you could get at a craft store.  Will not purchase from this group again.  Very misleading unfortunatley.<br /><br />I was incorrect...these are sandlewood beads after all.....I apologize for my comments and judgements.  These actually look very nice when wearing them....friend complimented them...that's how I learned they really are sandlewood.....Please consider these if you like the looks of them..."
5.0,"This shirt will definitely be a go to this school year. Very stretchy and soft. Will be great for 3 seasons, but definitely too warm for our hot, humid summers in northeastern PA. Patterns are crisp and bright, exactly as pictured. I ordered the black and white and the aqua multicolored patterns."
5.0,"I had to size up, but shipping on the dress and the replacement was quick and easy. The dress is stunning and I can’t wait to wear it to the gala this weekend! Word of caution though, if you think you might need it hemmed (i.e. if you’re shorter than “really tall”) be aware that because of the construction of the dress (which is very well done) it is quite expensive to get altered. It ended up costing me more to get it altered than I paid for the dress! (Granted, part of that was taking some of the excess fabric and making me some straps. But my seamstress said that was the easy and quick (Cheap) part. Worth it though, because even with what I paid for the dress and alterations, I’m ending up with a dress that looks like I paid a LOT more for!"
5.0,I love this dress I read the reviews which were mostly positive  but sizing seemed to be an issue with most and they were right I’m 5/5 36b 165 lbs dresses are usually almost impossible for me to Wear since I’m smaller up top and bigger on the bottom I went with a small based on reviews I’m usually medium/large and I must say the small actually fit me to my surprise the material is more like a T-shirt material which I like you can actually dress it up or dress it down if you want to put  a cute pair of  sandals To  just wear it around town or you can wear a pair of wedges and a nice statement necklace to go out for the night  I’m definitely happy with it
5.0,The item came undamaged in the time that was indicated.  It is a gift that has not yet been given so I cannot attest to the durability at this time.  The item is just as it appears in the photos and the leather is of high quality.
5.0,I like how sturdy the cards are inside but even you wanna use them they slide very easily. I like the slim design alot!
5.0,The earings are even more pretty in person. The shipment was quick. The quality is really strong.

5.0,Really cute. They are a gift for my niece Christmas. She loves pink.
5.0,"My husband bought this for me for Mother's Day and I love it!<br /><br />The charms are beautifully detailed, all 3D. The words written on the charms are easily read and the bracelet lays nicely against my wrist. I like how the weight of the bracelet and the size of the charms are proportionate. I've been wearing it non-step and it looks as good as the day I got it.<br /><br />I did have to send it back to get a smaller size but the company made it super easy. I contacted Jennifer through email, and she immediately emailed a return label. A few days later the correct bracelet came and it fits perfectly. I also opted to add a pencil charm. Again, the company responded immediately.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the bracelet and the company."
5.0,"Very good quality, attended expectations and arrived on time."

The stones show nicely and I get compliments on it whenever I wear it. My one critique is that after awhile it kinda pinches your head so you either take it off or get a headache."
5.0,Really cute and soft material
5.0,There are comfortable to wear and does the job.
5.0,Love this shirt. Very diverse as it can be dressed up or worn casually. Washes well. I hang it to dry just to be on the safe side. Always get compliments on it.

5.0,"The fit is just right and the color is awesome, I got very good comments about this dress. Everyone wanted to know where I bought it from."
5.0,great product for away from home use
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I wore it to a wedding and it’s so comfortable. I bought a large and I definitely could have sized down to a medium. It runs big. Nice quality. I would definitely recommend.

5.0,Fits perfect and looks good.  Not original Glass material but that's not even available directly from Ray Ban now at any price.
5.0,Love croc flip flops. I've been loyal to this brand for years. They're the most comfortable flip flops ever and they last for years even if worn every day. They provide good support.
5.0,These glasses are so nice. They are very comfortable to wear. I really like the way they look too.
5.0,These are perfect for my 2nd earring. I can leave tehm in to sleep and shower and they don't hurt or fall out.
5.0,Great fitting shirt. I ordered the 2XL TALL as a 6'8&#34; muscular man and it's perfect for my frame. Not too loose or tight. The shirt is using quality material here. Nice thick neck band too as I can't stand cheap shirts with thin neckbands that end up stretching and sagging over time looking tacky. Logo is bright and pressed on well to the shirt. Clear to read. Definitely a keeper.
5.0,"Very nice shirt, very pleased with the weight and fabric!!"
5.0,Will continue to purchase from this brand
5.0,I used these mittens on a recent Colorado ski trip and they worked very well.  I wore knit gloves underneath and they worked as liners and I could use my iPhone with them. I high recommend them.  I would not recommend using a hair dryer to dry them as they melt with hot temperatures.
5.0,My daughter said she loved it and especially the box. LOL
5.0,Fits as expected good quality
5.0,I bought this in red and really like the way blouse is cut - fits me well - I am a 36D and professionally speaking - this blouse is a 10 …. Thank you
5.0,"Beautiful blue dress!! Flattering for any size/shape!! The only negative I can say about this dress is that it is tapered at the bottom, which makes it difficult to walk fast. I guess they expect you to take small, delicate lady-like steps while wearing this. LOL  Still a great, extremely comfortable, pretty dress that is good for casual or dressy occasions."
5.0,Love it! Only complaint is the belt is lame.
5.0,Rings were a hit at the party.
5.0,"Beautiful locket, easy to add charms to. I dont have any complaints. The color crystals were also very vibrant."
5.0,"Love the ombre color. Very comfortable. By the end of the day, my feet and back aren't screaming for relief."
5.0,"This dress is amazing!!! I bought this dress for one occasion, but ended up wearing it to my BFFs funeral. The family chose to wear white w/purple flowers for the women. Even tho it was a sad occasion, I still received many compliments. I am 5'8 & 210 lbs. I bought an xl and it passed my ankles but didn't hit the top of my feet. I so satisfied that I will be buying the black and red one. Just make sure you don't wear anything bulky underneath, it's very form fitting."
5.0,Received this swimsuit today just as in the picture and good quality..... Ordered the xl due to my 36d boobs the bottom fit great and this was the only seller that had it in xl.... Because of my boobs the band in front is right under it so u don't see the words but it's not a problem.... Luv this swimsuit it's sexy and can't wait to wear it when I go to the Caribbean in two weeks time....
5.0,Excellent product. Love it.
5.0,Comfortable. Nice variety to pick from
5.0,Love it - so glad I bought it!
5.0,My daughter wears this all the time.  She loves how cute it is.
5.0,Purchased for my boyfriend and he loves it!!
5.0,Love this dress. It fit exactly how I wanted it to and it is perfect for work. The material is extremely comfortable.
5.0,Enjoying wallet. Color was as expected. Quality seems good.
5.0,Probably would have fit perfect but didn't realize they were not petite..
5.0,[[VIDEOID:32e921171d36226254cb56e664a59d80]] Sandals were a tight fit until I wore them a couple of days. Love the neutral color.
5.0,"It's exactly as  advertised. I'm shaping the bill with a rubber band to suit my personal taste, but the cap as-is seems fine and likely to last through normal wear."
5.0,I've ordered about every color from this company and I have a size 10 u.s. shoe and I always order up a size to the 43 and it fits perfect I just wish they had all the different styles in a 43 but some only come up to 42 and I know they won't fit but I love these shoes are very comfortable but they do not have an arch support so I would suggest buying an insole gel with a slight arch support to make them comfortable all day long
5.0,I like it has multiple single color
5.0,"tons of compliments, loved it. Hide all the bad areas and enhanced the good ones!"
5.0,Good quality and soft.
5.0,"I love my tree of life, I wear it often."
5.0,Son loves them!!!
5.0,"They look even better in person. They are leather, not plastic or fake. I gave them as gifts and all loved them also!"
5.0,"I bought this hat because it was just so cute looking! I got alot of compliments when I wore it! Cute,chunky,and worth it!"
5.0,"bought this for my nephew birthday, he loves it!"
5.0,Absolutely beautiful stones and fits perfectly! Will definitely make future purchases from this shop! 😍
5.0,"Seems wider than picture, but that is good! Some crease lines from shipping, but confident they will come out. I am quite pleased with purchase..."
5.0,So pretty! I am very happy with my purchase. The real stones are nice quality. Delighted with the price too!
5.0,Great looking tie. Have since purchased many more from this company..
5.0,Did not have a slot for my pen.
5.0,I love these chokers!! And so do others.  I have had lots of compliments.
5.0,My daughter in law loved it.
5.0,So pretty in person
5.0,Perfect. Fits and works great
5.0,"This ring was a bit too big for me (I ordered a size too big) but it is very pretty and detailed. I also asked for it in silver but I got it in gold. No biggie, I couldn’t have worn it anyway. It seems very well made though. It is very pretty. It comes in a cute ring box as well. I would recommend if you are into bulkier rings. I will probably reorder the silver one a size smaller."
5.0,The Material is awesome
5.0,They have to restock these :( They just have to!  never got around to ordering one at the time and they sold out so fast in my size!
5.0,This is exactly what I wanted. It has all the packets and space I need. It is durable and remains flat.
5.0,"My 9 year old son loves it. Great Christmas present, arrived on time with no delays."
5.0,I ordered a medium because reviews said it ran small. I felt it ran true to size and could have used a small. Medium fits but bottoms a tad bit large.<br />Super cute though!
5.0,Wonderful product and would highly recommend. Especially to those in the healthcare field. Extremely comfortable and also stylish which is a rare find
5.0,Good quality hat. really enjoy it.
5.0,I have a pandora bracelet & I used the charms for my bracelet & they fit perfectly... I love them!!! Definitely will be ordering more
5.0,Just like photo.  A little large but I have small wrists.  Very nice
5.0,"shirt looks great, nice vintage look"
5.0,"The pendant looks more beautiful in person than in pictures because of the very fine details. Color exactly like pictured. Neither too small nor too big. (I was worried looking at the pictures that the pendant might be too big, but it was just perfect.) Necklace looks cheap for the beautiful pendant (but I did not expect a high quality one for this price, which covers the pendant only), so I use the pendant on my other nice necklaces. Highly recommended!"
5.0,They’re great for working out and I’ve literally bought more than 15 individual shirts. I also use them for work since the hoodie helps cover the sun from the back part of the neck.
5.0,Great material and super cute!
5.0,"Good fit, thin material, comfy and sexy at the same time. Wonderful with jeans"
5.0,Great umbrella for the price! Easy to open and assemble.
5.0,"Easy to install, and a great replacement"
5.0,My great grandson enjoys wearing this comfortable cute sleeper!

5.0,"Love these! I'm a hoops earrings girl, but these are fabulous!!"
5.0,I looks Great! Just like the pic!
5.0,Love this set! I’ve gotten so many complaints on it!
5.0,Soft and stretchable.  Keeps their shape.  Great length for layering. I’ll buy more.
5.0,"Everyone LOVED my dress and accessories! Thank you! Perfect 20s outfit! Comfortable too! The headband was a bit tight for me so I just cut the elastic and sowed it a bit! Worked great! Gloves where good quality, jewelry too! Dress felt like a dress and not costume material which I loved!"
5.0,Perfect fit! Love the material
5.0,This jacket fits perfectly and is warm but super lightweight. I highly recommend it.
5.0,Perfect look perfect fit
5.0,"Will color change if worn in the water over and over again. Its a cute necklace but, it wont stay the color you order long. If you dont care about that, then order and rock it. Its a cute little necklace."
5.0,"My husband bought this because he is a saxophone player in a jazz combo. They needed white coats for a dinner performance. We were both pleasantly suprised with the quality of the material and construction of the  coat. We also felt that he had one of the best coats in the ensemble. Highly recommended for quality, fit and shipping speed."
5.0,"Love the design, Matte is on point."
5.0,These belay glasses are the most comfortable ones I have ever worn! The glasses cord for then to hang on your neck was soft and tick…not just a piece of cord. I love the durable case they come in as well.
5.0,"I really like this dress, it is very comfortable and light. Great for sunny days."
5.0,Me gusta y queda muy bien
5.0,"It looks like the pictures, it’s soft and warm, it washed well, I hung it to dry. It is oversized but that makes it comfortable."
5.0,Fits great and is a gorgeous color! Very happy with this product.
5.0,Great fitting comfy and cute two piece outfit you can wear for multiple occasions!!
5.0,The earrings are as advertised. I bought the pair for my neice and she loved them! The order also arrived prior to Christmas as promised.
5.0,"I bought it for my daughter.  She loves it. Its comfortable, soft and the right size."
5.0,"The cover-up is VERY cute.  It says “one size fits most” and being a top heavy woman (34DD), 5’4.5” at the weight of 174 it made me look like a smaller person LOL… I would even go as far as to say 200lb person could fit this due to the draw sting feature.  The cover-up doesn’t give you peek-a-boo cheeks (at least mine didn’t) and you’ll feel very confident in it.  I got lots of compliments in it.  This was a really great find, and I’ll be ordering one in black now, and another in white. I wore  it river tubing with me once to use it as a sun shade from the Arizona sun and the grass stained the white. But you WILL NOT regret this purchase!!!"
5.0,Looks very good in person and the sound is actually great!
5.0,Best buy ever for reading assistance and they are cute too.  one for office and one for bedroom.  Great buy
5.0,I purchased this watch to wear every day and feel it is a great value.
5.0,"The colors I ordered were not as bright as the picture,  but all in all very comfy and not too warm under scrubs. The material is very soft and wicks moisture well. I work in an ER and have not yet had a problem with the sleeves coming down while I'm doing something strenuous. Size recommendation was spot on."
5.0,So awesome for a trip with multiple hotels
5.0,good product good price
5.0,Beautiful and Elegant. Royal clothing.
5.0,Nice lace product. Made my girl feel sexy and do nasty things to me. Great price and comes in a variety of styles.
5.0,Daughter loves them. Nicely made.
5.0,Love love love this.  It's the perfect top for leggings
5.0,my husban love it
5.0,I had gotten my little girl a pair of Metal Mulisha Etnies years ago.  They were for boys but they looked so awesome on her.  I just happen to save them and ended up having a little boy a few years later.  So finally when he turned two he was able to wear them.  Eventually they got too small so I ordered another pair just a different style.  They came in the mail today and he loves them.  I wasn't aware when I ordered them that they have an insole in the shoe that you can take out when they get too small to make them larger.  I am very happy with this brand of shoes!
5.0,"Not much to say, really, perfect replacement for my son's watch, whose band finally gave up the ghost after about seven years. Easy on/off, he's pretty happy with it and so am I..."
5.0,The nose fits and it has a pocket for a filter. I feel like it is safe and protects me.
5.0,"This is my 3rd watch band from Henoda and so far I have been very happy with their products. I own a black Samsung Gear S2 replacement band for 2 months a blue band with white arrows both with the regular buckle closures and have now ordered the red band with the push close. My Gear S2 originally came with a white watch band so I ordered the replacement bands to switch up the look of the watch. The band is the same size as the larger (for size comparison) band that comes with the Gear S2 so it may be a little large for people with a smaller wrist. The rubber on this band is a little more flexible than the rubber of the original watch band but thats no big deal. As for the size and thickness of the watch band it seems to be the same as the original. This band has a closure similar to the iwatch rather than the one original to the Gear S2.  I have found the button or push closure similar to the iwatch to work well and keeps the watch secure on your wrist. The band attaches to the watch exactly the same as the original by sliding the band up into the watch from underneath and disconnects by pressing in the tab underneath and pulling down. The band holds the watch secure and matches the lines of the watch case the same way the original band does so it does not look off or like a cheap replacement. The watch band is overall a very good value considering what the cost is for a replacement band from Samsung.<br /><br />I want to add that I was able to purchase this watch band in return for a fair, honest, and unbiased review of the product. The opinion above is strictly my own, and I was in no way influenced by Amazon or the seller. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. I stand behind my reviews and would be happy to answer any questions if you contact me."
5.0,It's for my mother in law after her eye surgery but doesn't like too dark. She wears everyday since I received the product.
5.0,Awesome me and my girlfriend both love them
5.0,very cute just as pictured
5.0,Ordered these to replace my factory lenses that had seen better days . I liked the fact that they are thick as original and they didn't disappoint. Great quality and clarity.
5.0,They fit perfect and are very comfortable and the print is done perfect
5.0,Cute and super comfy! perfect for hot days!
5.0,"I bought these polka dot dresses for my 12-year old twin girls. There is nothing not to love about these dresses: they can twirl, carefree fit,  stretch for comfort, wash beautifully, and most of all they simply look adorable and stylish. In fact, I would have loved one of these for myself! Do not hesitate one second -  buy with confidence."
5.0,Gave these shoes as a gift. Fit well and well liked.
5.0,This is so soft and so cute on!
5.0,Cute headband that is comfortable
5.0,Beautiful.<br />Elegant.<br />Look great!<br />Many compliments...they even SMELL really nice! :)
5.0,Nice fit and band is perfect eye candy replacement for but cleavage
5.0,Love how these feel and fit!!!!
5.0,Awesome feel
5.0,"These are somewhat small b/c I normally wear a 7.5-8, and these fit me perfectly! They provide great support and are fun when you have to wear that same old uniform everyday :-)"
5.0,Fit perfect. Right to size.
5.0,The first shipment was broken and the watches were missing. Amazon resent another package. I am quite happy so far.
5.0,"This was a steal at the price, even with the month it took to get here. Heavier than I expected, but not really in any kind of bad way. The only thing wrong with it is that the bottom of the box is a little crooked because there is a little piece of metal that needs to be filed down so the base will sit more flat, but it's entirely negligible. Were I not a hands-on sort of person, I would be perfectly content not to bother with it at all. I will be buying another one in the bronze color very shortly."
5.0,This shirt is a great polo. The fit is just as you would expect. There is no need to buy a size larger. The color is just like the picture and the gold emblem on the shirt really stands out.
5.0,They are great compact. Fit well I. Small handbag.
5.0,Gorgeous and not made cheap I'm super happy
5.0,"Waterproof. Folds down. Keeps feet warm up to 32° ( much higher than they advertised). Not a big deal for me as I’m very active in construction if I’m in them. Good work boots. Kick on and off easy. Good for the price. Decent. Seems like it will last years if not damaged on metal or whatnot, things like razor sharp rebar. Worn 3 months. No issues besides advertised  temperature. Throw on extra socks for below freezing."
5.0,Increíble fit perfect! I really like it
5.0,"I am fully aware of the statistics on the efficiency of this style ""mask"" in its ability to stop the COVID19 virus or my moist vapor being dispersed over unsuspecting individuals. This is my choice in masks due to its light weight and breathability. My only complaint is that the gaiter will slowly work its way down off of your nose requiring a readjustment of the gaiter. I'll put up with that small inconvenience vs wearing hot, stuffy cloth or medical type masks. I'm a few months shy of 69, and like to show my patriotism with the USA planted across my nose and mouth with a bald eagle on either cheek."
5.0,I love the style of a halter top and this one fits in a very flattering way with the bottom band (hides the tummy)  and the color is beautiful.
5.0,I bought this and at first i thought it wasn't worth the price but i went with another brand for my second one and the difference shows. This blends quicker and leaves my shakes pretty smooth for a portable blender. The glass is a must.
5.0,Comfortable fabric and great fit! I am purchasing a second color in this dress!
5.0,Worth the buy. Super cool.
5.0,Wish I ordered a smaller size.
5.0,This is an awesome product. I am exchanging for the adjustable one as I plan to wear it around my ankle. Company is very helpful! Highly recommend!
5.0,I love these! Came earlier than expected and was exactly what i needed. The length is perfect without sticking out of the piercing like most. Also it came with a cute mini bag to put them in.
5.0,Very nice my friend loves it!!!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful! Does not come with a chain.
5.0,Cute outfit for baby !
5.0,No buckle. These elastic belts hold the back of your jeans from gaping in the back when you sit or bend over. I bought 1 in each color of my pants.
5.0,Absolutely perfect! This fit my grandmothers Pandora bracelet perfectly!
5.0,Love these shirts so much! I have them in three colors! They run TTS. Not made of a heavy sweatshirt material. Super comfy!
5.0,"Thank goodness I tried these on ahead of time! I'm normally a size 8 and I tried on my friend's 7, it is perfect. Go one size smaller or at least a half size smaller. She was a 7.5 and I'm a 8. We both wear 7 in this shoe."
5.0,Soft and perfect! Gave as a baby shower gift and they're so pretty.
5.0,I instantly fell in love. Looks and feels well made. Does not feel cheap or flimsy. The legs are sturdy which I especially like.
5.0,"I love the watch band. It fits perfectly on my large wrist. I’ve had so many complements on it already. I love the little guard at the end to prevent it from unhooking, also."
5.0,Great blouse!  Fits perfectly.  Love it!
5.0,🤘🏻
5.0,Good Quality Material and well made. Ought to last a long time in and out of my pocket every day
5.0,Great tags!! I tecommend them for sure.
5.0,"I like it. It’s really hard to put in tho, as you can see from the picture my ear is super red and swollen from trying to get the earring in. I wish it was threadless as that would have been much easier"
5.0,Its perfect
5.0,Very easy to pack clothes & it stays as it is.
5.0,This was the perfect thermal for ski trip. It’s also super sexy looking. Very comfortable.
5.0,Perfect. Exactly as advertised.
5.0,Exactly as pictured -- great quality! Loving everything about these!<br />Purchased for my wife as a Christmas gift. She's happy!
5.0,These little earrings were so perfect for my daughter.  She was the tooth fairy for Halloween and these were the perfect finishing touch!
5.0,"Love this dress! Super comfortable fabric, cute for fancy or casual occasions. It's priced reasonably as well."
5.0,Looking forward to wearing this in fall when I go back to work in a school. Tons of options for layering and not to sheer or short! Great burgundy color!
5.0,Nice pin.  Goes well with the rest of my flair
5.0,Really impressed they are just the right size and look real
5.0,Very nice..will buy another.
5.0,I love this top. It's made well and looks very flattering on. You can dress it up or wear it casually. The fit is true to size. I plan on buying another color.
5.0,Material is of great quality
5.0,"This is such a pretty bracelet! It reads:<br />When you get overwhelmed, just remember whose daughter you are and adjust your crown<br /><br />It's a bangle, but it's not easy to adjust, it's such strong metal but it stays on my wrist perfectly!<br /><br />One thing I wish was that I with the writing was on the product outside of the bracelet, but it's written inside. I've got other bangles like this that aren't appropriate to have the writing on the outside (one that says keep f-ing going), but this one can totally have the phrase visible! As you can see from the photo, the outside of the bracelet is plain and just has pretty arrows on the ends.<br /><br />I think this is a great inspirational gift to give to someone special who may need reminding of how great they are."
5.0,This dress is very high quality and the stones are attached very well so they don’t fall off when toddler plays. My daughter wears this dress as a daily wear dress and is hard on it. It holds up very well and fits perfectly.
5.0,"These are so pretty and very nice quality for the price. I love adding them to a ribbon to decorate a gift, especially around Valentine's day. Very pleased and signs definitely order more."
5.0,large attractive face and very easy to read
5.0,Fit as expected & fit well. I like the colors. Stretchy fabric is easy to move in. Long board short length so I don't worry about showing too much. You can roll the top over too if you prefer a lower fit or have them as a higher rise.
5.0,"So soft, beautiful colors."
5.0,Most night vision glasses look too ordinary.  And yet bulky.  This one though really got some fashion to it and yet it does its job. I've used it a few times and its done its job. Would recommend this!!
5.0,"A nice and sexy pajama lingerie set from Queen.M. I will say I like the cut of this lingerie and it does look sexy. This does come with transparent underwear but these are skimpy and not very comfortable. This is an easy piece of lingerie to put on, just slip it over your shoulders and adjust the straps until it fits. The stitching is well done and I like the way it sits on me, hugging the right places and is flirty. There are no flaws in the color in terms of fading. The little bow in the front is cute and is a nice touch. It is very pretty with the exquisite lace detail across the top. The sheer lace is nice along the top and the slits in the skirt area are sexy<br /><br />Overall, this is a very flirty outfit which actually looks sexy and well made. The size I ordered fit me as expected and I have had no issues with the outfit in terms of manufacturing or comfort. It is not itchy or rough against the skin so that is a positive. The adjustable straps are nice as I can set it so that it fits me better.<br /><br />I do routinely provide feedback on products I try so that other shoppers and friends may avoid some of the not so good choices on products they are looking for while avoiding the bad products. I have found this to be an effective and quality product which is nice and performed as promised by the seller. Please, if you find this review to be helpful to you be sure to hit YES. Thank you and happy shopping!"
5.0,A beautiful dress just made me feel larger and I had to return if I was 20 pounds lighter it would be perfect.
5.0,"Super cute charm! Just wish they were double sided, but they worked perfect for the craft day at the horse rescue. I pay for my own supplies and would love to hear you offer larger qualities at a discount, but everyone loved these ay the jewelry making booth and the proceeds went to a great cause!  Will order more fur the next fundraiser. Yes, if you don't mind a single sided charm, then I highly recommend.<br /><br />~K"
5.0,This is very striking.  I was afraid it would look cheap but was very happy.  Just wish there were earrings to match.
5.0,"This are great, look good, bendable nose ring, best I have tried."
5.0,Fit great and feels great. Perfect for spring or summer. Love it I picked a medium and fits great
5.0,Great product.  Have given as gifts.
5.0,This
5.0,Worked great for my net doors on my 2017 Polaris Ranger 900xp! Only needed a small modification with a drill bit. The actual clip is 21.00 each!
5.0,I purchased the two blues because it such a great blouse. True to size and receive compliments on the color and style.
5.0,I don’t normally wear sling back heels because they feel wobbly to me. These MK heels feel like a dream. They’re fashionable and the wide strips very trendy.  My feet are on the wide side but these fit perfectly not too tight. I can dance in them and squat comfortably. So they’re  a win win.
5.0,I really like this purse. It's just the correct size if you are going on vacation and want to take a travel purse that has a good amount of room in it. I like that is has a zippered pocket on each side. The drink holder can be expanded by the zipper that runs down and around. I also like the 2 zippered pockets can open on the top. Has several pockets. Love this purse.
5.0,These are great! They are not as large as I expected (about the size of a quarter each) and not as heavy as expected either. Very fun for spirit days!
5.0,It arrived super fast. Only ten days and I was expecting to wait another week or two. It's soft and so comfortable. Only issue is one of the handles is sewn a little off. The end is sticking out but it doesn't bother me. Overall I love it. Great quality from only $2
5.0,I love this waist trainer! It also helps me with my posture it's great.
5.0,I love this shirt it fit as expected
5.0,Love the pattern and fit of the dress.<br />A few loose threads have been found but all in all a great dress.<br />The pattern is just as pictured.
5.0,"Excellent for blocking out the Florida sunshine, still I did not pay attention to the size which was a tad too large and had to return it."
5.0,Great price and quick delivery. Got it for a birthday present.
5.0,Bought this ring as a Christmas present for my 12 year old daughter. This ring is beautiful and well made. I love it.. I'm more then sure she will too!
5.0,Very cute and look just like the picture!!
5.0,Love it! Was hesitant to buy with some of the other reviews but it turned out to be good quality and is super cute.
5.0,Pretty great
5.0,"I had to return this as it came free with an item I ended up returning, so I returned this necklace as well. But the stone is brilliant and big and shiny. Great quality!"
5.0,"Durable, great fit, easy off and on"
5.0,I wanted comfort and that’s what I got with these compression tops..
5.0,Love love!! Took this to the beach and use it at the pool. Fits our 2 year old perfectly. And she LOVES it!!
5.0,It’s pretty! And easy.  And goes with my jewelry. Looks nice
5.0,I love it! It looks so beautiful and arrived in a little box that is just too cute! It was like finding a little present in the mail. I can't wait to wear this gorgeous piece out.
5.0,"Great collar, Amazing Seller. I have absolutely nothing but good things to say about the quality of this product and it fit extremely well on my adorable little pet."
5.0,Omg! I love this! They are just perfect!
5.0,It does exactly what its suppose to do. The quality is great and it stays hooked to you belt loop. I have 2 of them and haven't had them fall off or haven't lost anything on them.
5.0,I use these glasses to play simple games on my iPad before going to sleep. It's nice that I could order my magnification too. It works.
5.0,Super cute and soft perfect dress for the holiday
5.0,"Didn't realize how much my hair covered the necklace, but those who seen it, really liked it."
5.0,Really good towel
5.0,Works for exactly what I needed it for. Quick shipping. Soft fabric. Fits just right! Thank you!
5.0,These are great they fit perfectly and they go up the waist also so they're great for holding the tummy and to be in shape I suppose if I used them more often and worked out in them they'd be a great help also to trim the fat :)
5.0,"A decent gym legging. Thick but breathable. It is super high-waisted which helped to conceal some excess belly after the birth of my son. I would recommend, I get compliments all the time."
5.0,I ordered a medium and it fit my 135 lb. body perfectly.  The color is exactly as pictured.  I purchased a pair of green skinny jeans to go with it and am now ready for St. Patrick's Day.
5.0,"This soft and unique scarf is interesting and I love it because it has recipes too. Anytime I have it on, I  got a lot of compliments. It is a soft and perfect size for around the neck in winter, Spring, and Fall, just by looking at glasses with colorful drinks makes me happy."
5.0,"I went back and forth in my head a few times before buying this because I wasn’t sure if it would be really cheap looking or low quality. I am so happy that I trusted my gut and bought it because I just loved the colors, design and the fit. No complaints here at all!"
5.0,It’s very good the way I expected it<br />Confortable and warm inside<br />Real boot for snow time I give it a five star for comfort and price
5.0,"I bought this as a gift for my best friend and it is way better quality than I expected. It's thick, probably because it's reversible, so it'll be perfect for fall-spring late nights and early mornings (she works 3rd shift anyway). Very soft, excellent quality, and both sides look amazing. It also got here earlier than was projected, about three days sooner!"
5.0,"This shirt is even better than I expected. Every time I wear it, I get multiple compliments. The fabric is a little thin and does not have any stretch to it, so make sure to get the appropriate size. Otherwise, the style and cut are awesome."
5.0,Great gift for the price.
5.0,My grandchild loves it
5.0,Perfect! Gorgeous! Amazing transaction!
5.0,Looks great exactly like the picture.
5.0,Wears well and washes well.  I get lits of compliments!
5.0,Loved this shirt and got sooo many compliments on it! Recommend highly!
5.0,"I didn't like the pocket flap because it stuck out and was useless, so I took it off. Now am very happy, with these Camo sweats. I would order more if I liked the other colors and patterns, which I don't. I might actually order a second pair of the Camo style. I wear Size 6 usually or 8 if baggy, and am 5'8"", 136lbs, and the medium fit great."
5.0,"My wife asked me to buy it for her and I expected it to be cheap and smell bad but the quality is actually a lot better than I expected. ( I had bought a 3DS case and some other little totes that all smelled like gasoline.) this is replacing a Fjalkenraven bag I had gotten for her years ago that is a bit too big and old, and it has been doing great for 3-4 months now."
5.0,Very cute !  Loved it!!!
5.0,"Like it, a little smaller than I thought but it'll work"
5.0,to small for me as i like a big robe but my sister in law is in love with it.
5.0,Very cute earrings.
5.0,IT LOOKS GREAT
5.0,"I love this case, my glasses fit in here perfect and very durable. I would buy another one if i needed to and they came on time and very pleased."
5.0,"I love this shirt. It’s very comfortable. Lightweight. It fits loose just like i wanted. I wear a sports bra 99% of the time. You can see that. It does show skin below the sports bra. So if you don’t want that, i would size down maybe. I am 5’3 145lbs and i got the large because i wanted a loose fit. I probably would have been ok with a medium."
5.0,I bought this dress for my 12 yr old granddaughter to wear in a wedding. It's perfect. Good value for the money.
5.0,Really nice quality. Looks great under a suit jacket wearing a solid colored T-shirt.
5.0,Love that dress a little long
5.0,"Once again, I loved it so much that I have one in every color. Light, breezy, wash and wear! And everyone I meet asks where I got this. But they are just so comfy I can't get enough!!!"
5.0,Had it on for 2 years the heat will make it pop up but it still works thanks
5.0,This is a beautiful beautiful dress my granddaughter loved it
5.0,Super cute. Arrived fast. I have a baby I have to carry so I need all the free hands I can get—Makes life easier. Only thing is I have a feeling the zipper might break soon. I’ve had it for maybe 2 months now. I am still happy with my purchase. I would recommend to my friends & family
5.0,Love the quality. Fit great and so soft.
5.0,"I like this dress it is light and comfortable, I bought it to wear at a company function. When i took it out of the pack i wasnt too impressed, then I tried it on and if fit perfect!"
5.0,Looks and fits as expected!  Hems are great.  Once washed it did not shrink!  Reordered in other colors!
5.0,"This swimsuit is exactly as described. It is well designed, fits comfortably, and doesn't look cheap. My daughter loves this suit with the mermaid print, the little skirt, and the shoulder ruffles. Best of all, this suit has adjustable shoulder straps so she'll be able to wear it for more than a year. It is definitely worth every penny."
5.0,"I got this for my hubby for a bday gift. He absolutely loves wearing this mask, its easy to breathe thru and its the only mask he will wear."
5.0,Great dress! Fabric is nice and thick..I am 5’5 about 135lbs and got the medium. I had to alter it around the chest area... I brought it in about an inch and a half and now it fits perfect! It has this stretchy material in the back that’s nice and snug! I got more compliments on this dress than anything I have ever bought. I will definitely purchase another!
5.0,"I gave this as a gift to someone who is going on a trip and needed something that would fold up in a suitcase.  This does, and it is a really cute hat as well."
5.0,"Jewelry arrived as as yet, no issues. Good product!"
5.0,"I bought this for my son to wear to a costume party.  I didn't want to break the bank on something he would probably wear once so this is a good price point.  It's really good quality.  It comes with a shirt, pants, ascot, necklace with a medallion,  and a lovely cape."
5.0,"as the picture, arrived way before expected great service... LOVE IT"
5.0,"wow! i've been looking everywhere for comfy nightgown. so glad i found these! affordable, comfortable, beautiful color! i like it on the bigger side, more room to move ;) usually a medium, ordered a large and fits nicely!"
5.0,The bag very pretty I love the colors....<br />Very nice bag
5.0,Wear this to show support for those breast cancer survivors and those in treatment now.  Compliments any pink outfit perfectly.
5.0,These socks are so so so cute! They are a little smaller/shorter than I had hoped for but I still love them!
5.0,N i need d large size cuz I really luv dress
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality!<br />I get so many compliments.. It’s all the same at the end of the day. If you have prestige you make the pieces look good."
5.0,"Beautiful, comfortable, no irritation.  The little plastic holder-on things didn't arrive with the earrings, but I don't care.  Finally - earrings without pain!"
5.0,"It's soft and warm, a true sweat shirt. Not a tee shirt that they are calling a sweat shirt. The fit is the same as shown in the picture and so is the color."
5.0,Great for the gym
5.0,"SPF 50, stain resistant, and made from recycled water bottles, makes these shirts excellent for fishing while helping save the oceans one plastic bottle at a time!"
5.0,Good shoes and quality
5.0,It's exactly what I was looking for.  And for the price?  You can't beat it.
5.0,"A nice pair of glasses, good by looks and the price. I would recommend.<br />Can change different colors and can go blinky, good for a club or a dress up ;)"
5.0,Soft fun and love it. Great price too!!
5.0,Product arrived on time as described
5.0,"I wanted a nice, casual dress to lounge around in on my birthday at the end of June. This was perfect!! Fit, durability, material, l absolutely loved it and got plenty of compliments."
5.0,I gave this belt a somewhat negative review based on the spring in the buckle breaking after the return period. I contacted the seller and they replaced the belt. The replacement is working fine.
5.0,I had bought the original belt to small so glad I could just order this to fix
5.0,"Mi llavero esta muy bien ,buena calidad."
5.0,Really cute.  My daughter was a micro preemie and has the TINIEST feet ever!  These fit her &#60;3  I am very pleased with the purchase and will probably get all of her shoes from this company.
5.0,I like this bands specially the price. The only bad thing I have to say is about the QC work the way they attached the bands together it got the bands kind of stock together when you try to take them apart you be pealing some of the color.
5.0,Needed a yellow dress for a destination wedding. It's cute & has pockets!
5.0,Great product. Fast transaction. Would buy again. Thanks!
5.0,They fit perfect and feel even better

5.0,"The watch band is very nice quality.  It's nice and thick and seems like it is very strong.  The silicon is nice and smooth, nice buckle and was easy to install.  May order more bands for my other watches."
5.0,I picked these up for my girl and she loves them they are good quality and arrived super fast. I'm glad I got these form this supplier than the others
5.0,A lote of soldiers die for this flag.
5.0,Pretty and good quality.
5.0,Absolutely love this hoodie! It's so soft and comfortable. Definitely my favorite hoodie!
5.0,"The best I can say about this piece is that it's exactly as seen in the picture.  What you see is what you get.  The fabric is velvet, but it's not very thick, so it will stretch a little bit.<br /><br />On a personal note, I find the jacket affordable and versatile (good with a Goth or Victorian ensemble, a normal-designed skirt or even a pair of jeans).<br /><br />Absolutely recommended."
5.0,"Very nice and good looking watch. Fits very well on my small 6.25 in wrist. It has kept excellent time since it arrived, only gaining 3-4 seconds per week. I went ahead and ordered an official Oris metal bracelet through a local authorized dealer (pricey!) since I plan to wear it for many years to come."
5.0,I am in love with this hat!!! It’s so lightweight I even forget it’s on!!! I would definitely  recommend.
5.0,I CAN SEE...I CAN SEE...I CAN SEE...SWIMMING HAS BECOME FUN AGAIN...FITS SNUG...EASYTO PUT ON...
5.0,Omg. Just got a new indoor spin bike and these have saved my rear end from a lot of pain. Highly recommend.
5.0,"By far my favorite hat, the best part is my head stays warm but doesn't over heat. I also noticed that even wearing it I never got bad hat hair. It's soft and it came quick. The quality it worth the price this will be the best investment you will make. I will have multiple colors."
5.0,"Well made, exactly what was shown"
5.0,Son wears cap all the time.
5.0,"Excellent quality and fit. I was waiting for the XL gloves to be available online for a while and once they were in stock again I jumped on them.<br />The leather is great and allows for lots of independent movement, the lining is soft and warm. Great pair of Spring ski gloves, or if you live in the Northeast you can pretty much wear them all ski season."
5.0,"Very nice product , will be doing more business with"
5.0,I absolutely love this strap. It exceeded my expectations. I got so many compliments from my girlfriends and they couldn't believe it got it for a few bucks.  The color is just a tad bit off to match my LV but nevertheless this was such a great purchase.
5.0,Got my carry on luggage before estimated time. It's so unique that I can spot it a mile away. It's very cute and perfect for my travel needs.
5.0,Esta hermoso
5.0,Great shirt if you want to keep cool and keep from getting sunburned. Well ventilated and the shirt looks nice.
5.0,Light weight ! Very nice !
5.0,My wife's tits looked banging. Would recommend
5.0,Very warm and fit great. I am surprised at the quality and warmth and I have different colors to match different coats.<br />I love my gloves!
5.0,Love these! They don't leave a weird film in your mouth like some other pork rinds.
5.0,The hat size seemed fine initially but tightened alittle after alittle perspiring
5.0,"The top is a true bikini top if you are top heavy, but the bottoms were extremely high waisted which covers the parts I am more self conscious about.  Its nice to wear a real bikini again."
5.0,I love this set! Exactly what I needed for a neon day at school. I’m a curvy woman at 165lbs and everything fits fine. I will say though that they are kinda different shades of neon green. Not all super bright but it doesn’t bother me!
5.0,Bought this for my girlfriend as gag gift. She liked it and for the price it was worth it.
5.0,"Just what I was looking for<br />Good fit, light weight<br />Like the texture and color"
5.0,I LOVE these shoes.
5.0,These fit perfectly over ankle braces (AFO) and give extra grip in helping our little one.
5.0,Easy to breathe. Does not restrict breathing
5.0,"Nothing beats the F-91W when it comes to a cheap watch that does everything it needs to:  wears extremely comfortably, is durable and water resistant (should be able to shower and go swimming without worry), tells accurate time for a quartz movement, and looks cool and retro.  Photos show strap swapped out for standard black, but the original jelly ones are cool too."
5.0,"I gave these to my daughter, as a gift, and she loves them!  They have become her earrings of choicce, for daily wear."
5.0,"I bought this sweatshirt for a friend because she loved mine so much. We both love our sweatshirts, they're warm & comfortable & fit great."
5.0,Great navel ring of good quality
5.0,These are earrings are gorgeous! I love skulls and these earrings couldn't make me any happier. So feminine and pretty but with that bad ass skull look that gives you just a hint of an edge. They do look like the photo. So sparkly and girly yet they are the perfect earnings for any skull lover. These definitely make a statement without being too &#34;loud&#34; and he diamonds are beautiful too. The skull has tons of details and the heart eyes just make it for me.
5.0,With this dress.. so many compliments when I wore it.. great dress for the price!
5.0,Loved the dress. I purchased a larger size because I saw reviews that it ran small
5.0,"I bought this for my daughter to use with Dotera Defender oil during cold and flu season. its stylish enough she will wear it, and sturdy enough it will not get broken on the playground. Great price point as well."
5.0,The perfect gift for yourself if you’re a fan of all the coolest jewelry and fashion!
5.0,My son loves his anime hoodie and practically lives in it!!
5.0,Cozy and warm.
5.0,Adorable. Fit my daughter just right.
5.0,Very comfy sexy style and true to size
5.0,"Well they were SUPER small. And I bought them mainly for the black and the black didnt have its pair. So, Ive been using the gray/black. I was bummed when I got these though, they havent infected my ears or anything so, at least the material they use is wearable. UPDATE: company reached out to me and replaced the black earrings along with two other sets AND sent me larger ones. Thank you so much! Great customer service!"
5.0,My son loves these glasses.  They make him look &#34;cool&#34;.
5.0,I wore this darling hat for a Derby Day party. It was a hit!
5.0,"I ride a 2011 G650GS and needed some new boots. I purchased these from my local BMW dealer, and they are amazing. These have to be the most comfortable boots I've ever stuck my feet in. One thing to be aware of is there's no getting around the black smudge on top of the boot from your shifter but that's a tiny price to pay for an awesome boot."
5.0,Great for making your bag easier to identify!
5.0,Oh what a cute top!! and great price!  I just ordered the size that fit my chest measurement. The rest was all easy!
5.0,Love this top! It looks great with a long skirt! Just what I was looking for!
5.0,Very happy with these. Good fit. Good support. Easy care.
5.0,"Packaging and value was very nice! Stuck well, fit as expected and quality was better than expected. They even came with a plastic carry case. I should be able to wear these a few times. Would purchase again"
5.0,These block out noise really well. So well I used them for myself while running a belt sander. I mainly got them for my kids but it's nice to have them around the house for anyone when needed.
5.0,"I've worn a set of these frequently since purchasing in May, sometimes daily and sometimes not taking them out at night or when showering. Now August, they still do not look tarnished or scratched up and they don't discolor my skin. The silver is not as shiny as some of my sterling silver rings, I prefer the gold set, but a solid investment at this price and exactly what I was looking for. I have a double piercing and the effect of the matching sets in slightly different sizes next to each other is nice."
5.0,"Perfect. Strong and sturdy. This is my second order, I loved them so much."
5.0,"First, all club ride flannels are awesome.  Really well made, great material, and they are &#34;athletic&#34; fit but not too thin.  I'm 6'1&#34; with monkey arms and they fit well.<br />If you are wondering the difference in flannels, here is how they compare:<br />Jack: lighter weight material.  Cool to mild weather.<br />Shaka: mid-weight, like a traditional flannel shirt.<br />Gravity: heavier, kind of denim material. Not really a flannel.<br />Lake Creek: Shaka + Gravity basically."
5.0,"When this arrived in its Amazon box, I opened it and was very pleasantly surprised to find a metal case.  In side this metal case that had the logo on it, was a coiled belt.  This belt is canvas and stiff, initially.  my husband wore it to the sports team's game (he works the scoring table), and was very pleased with it.  The buckle is not too large to sit in for long periods of time, nor too small that it digs in when sitting.  It is strong, sturdy belt that can dress up or dress down.  The color is neutral enough to go with any pants from khakis to jeans, and all in between.  This belt has no &#34;give&#34; or stretch in it, canvas belts are not supposed to.  This is one fabulous belt and i plan on purchasing another.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount/free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My opinions are always my own and are never influenced by the seller. I truly hope my thorough testing and review of this product has helped you come to a decision. If my review has helped you please hit the helpful button, so I can continue to test and review more products for people like yourself."
5.0,Perfect fit for my 6 year old son!
5.0,Had been looking for these for awhile as I make my own survival para-cord bracelets. These were an excellent find at a great price and arrived quickly. Thanks.
5.0,I just ordered another color because I liked the orange one so much!  Very cute & surprising good quality for the price.
5.0,These are really comfortable and have a great stretch.  I like the quality and can see that I will be using them a lot in the future.
5.0,Made really well. Love it
5.0,I ordered a few others at the same time that were cheaper. You could definitely tell the difference in the quality. The tassels on the cheaper ones were plastic and not as shining.
5.0,"Fantastic quality! Thick cotton, so NOT see through at all.  Such a sweet item.  I am so thrilled with this gown, I'm going to order multiple more!"
5.0,"Great waist trimmer, comfortable."
5.0,True to fit. Very comfortable.
5.0,Wife bought this. It's nice and comfortable she said.
5.0,Get so many compliments
5.0,"Chinese sizes are much smaller than American so my 4x jacket is actually what would be called a Medium here.  It looks good though.  Normally I wear a large, but I think the slightly more snug fit looks good on me."
5.0,These socks are great quality! The design is adorable.
5.0,"Other reviews said this ran big, so I ordered a size down and it was perfect."
5.0,"I like this bec its so soft & long, I will use this everyday for casual walking. It will work both unisex. For alpaca content ,it is not costly. I can use it for hiking too provided I have a padding on the sole. I ordered large for women so as to prevent a lot of stretching & less holes . Large size was just right for my shoe size of 9."
5.0,Beautiful piece that our son loved for Christmas!
5.0,"Love these yoga pants as it holds everything in place! Great for yoga or exercising! It’s also very warm, soft and comfy, totally worth it! The material seems to be made very well and it isn’t thin either it’s on the thicker side. Love these! The only thing is that the markings on the back which is more for like lifting your butt is a bit lower then my actual cheeks but other then that they are very comfy!"
5.0,Great Mother's Day gift. Great setbice and fast shipper. Thank you
5.0,ordered for a project. Great !
5.0,"Everything I love from this dress true color, true size."
5.0,Arrived on time in simple secure packaging.  Fit as expected and are heavy duty for years of wear.  Happy with purchase.
5.0,Beautiful quality earrings.  Look great
5.0,"My grandson will not take them off. I think he glued them on, he loves them!"
5.0,"I waited sometime after receiving my tote to see how it would perform.  I work from home one day a week plus I am taking two classes and bring the books back and forth.  This bag has out performed my expectations.  After use for work on school the bag still looks beautiful, no change in the integrity.  Great product that performs wonderfully."
5.0,This suit looked great on me at the Hard Rock pool in Panama. My friend raved at how cute it was. However one of the loops that holds the shoulder strap popped. Thankfully it’s not a necessity to use the straps or I’d be crushed that it was gone in just one use.
5.0,I loved this band but after 3 days it turned my wrist green and had a bad smell so I wasted more money on a band I can not use anymore.
5.0,Pretty nice costume the price is great and design nice too
5.0,Perfect fit and high quality print.
5.0,"These stainless steel earrings are beautiful. They are the perfect size for me and the best part, other than being beautiful, they don't make my ears itch. I was worried that the backs and posts might have nickel in them, but they are stainless steel as well. I love these Love Knot earrings and highly recommend them for people with an allergy to metal (nickel) like me."
5.0,Lightening fast shipping. Perfect costume.
5.0,Perfect Summer dress. A little shorter than expected but not bad at all. Love it!!
5.0,These leggings are very soft. They are long enough for me at five foot eight.
5.0,Very nice color and quality.  I had a very small wrist the small/medium size fits perfect.
5.0,"Ordered this to replace old key lanyard but wow this is nice! Leather is cut symmetrical and fastened real well. About 2mm thick, does not stretch, old world brown. A little beeswax and leather honey and should last."
5.0,Reasonably priced. Cute piece
5.0,"I am very satisfied with these buttons, but I would rather have 4 large buttons and 6 small ones.<br />the large ones are the ones that are most often lost."
5.0,please and would order again
5.0,"I ordered one size up as I like baggy feel. It is super light fabric and very comfy. It has a baggy feel.  I’ll order another one but size small for a more snug fit. Overall, it does what I need. Baggy. Comfy feel shorts. Looks good wih a t shirt over it."
5.0,These were a great addition for our boy's paper money collection.  Great size too.  Good quality.
5.0,Granddaughter loves her down coat. Super lightweight and not bulky.
5.0,They look awesome !!!
5.0,Tal como en la imagen
5.0,Love this brand and style ... fabric is lightweight and soft!
5.0,Very comfortable fun slippers!
5.0,Really funny charm addition!!
5.0,Quick delivery.  Works well with layering necklaces.  Very discrete way way to get your steps in!
5.0,"so cute, my 6 year old granddaughter giggled and loved this little kitty.  Large enough that I could fill with some goodies."
5.0,Item exceeded expectations and was delivered ahead of schedule.
5.0,They seem to be great so far.
5.0,I used them on identical sleeping bags that my daughters received as a gift so they could tell them apart. The company makes a variety of colors that are very appealing. I received my order the following day!
5.0,Got this for my sister and shes worn it 3 times. Its comfy and pretty.... buttons fall off the back so be careful
5.0,Good fit and soft texture.
5.0,"I WANT YOU TO KNOW, SOJOS IS TOP QUALITY. I KNOW WHERE TO SHOP FOR MY GLASSES NOW. THESE ARE AWESOME, THANKS A BUNCH. : ) I AM SO HAPPY!!!!!"
5.0,"My 13 yr old loves it and wears it daily. Has held up through all summer water events (beach/pool, etc). Good quality."
5.0,Nicer than expected and very unique piece.
5.0,"These organizers made packing for my 11 day trip with just a carry-on SO easy! Not only can you keep all your items separate for easy access and packing/unpacking, but the ones for clothes have mesh on one side, so once you zip up your suitcase all the air is let out, so you no longer need a bigger suitcase. The ones that are not see-through are still breathable enough that they release excess air too, and they're great for storing feminine products or any other items you don't want your travel companion seeing. The dirty laundry bag is not large enough to fit sweaters or t-shirts in, but at least you can get dirty socks and underwear in. I'm sure if you were traveling with tank tops or thinner shirts, they would fit in the laundry bag easily. Overall, a great set perfect for people who travel light!"
5.0,I was worried that the bag would look cheap cause if the price. I was so wrong! I love this bag!!! It’s super Roomie and has compartments for everything. Great quality and looks just as good. Goes with everything too! Buy it
5.0,Great Military quality to last not all loose .<br /><br />Thank you
5.0,"This is fantastic, it's light, it's breathable, it's all I was looking for. I can't ask for more considering what I paid. I will be completely honest, however. I had to take off one star from comfort because once in a while my arm's hairs ended-up caught in the magnet latch. It's not really a big deal."
5.0,Love it .. beautiful color stone
5.0,Love it as expected!
5.0,These pants are wonderfully soft. The S/M size fit for someone 5’8”. I have a new favorite pair of pants now!
5.0,The cap display came in excellent condition and displays the cap very well.  Like the gold posts. I would recommend it for anyone looking for such a display.
5.0,Xcellent..fit well
5.0,Great little earring
5.0,These are awesome! They are very interesting and gotten a lot of compliments on them!
5.0,"My key is 1"" wide at its widest point, and I had to wiggle it back and forth but it went in fairly easily and fits perfect.  I love that it's 3-D-ish so I can feel in my pocket or in the dark and know where my apartment key is and which way it goes in.  The whole in the key matches up perfectly with the whole in the cat key cover so even if the cover breaks, the key is still on the ring which is what I wanted after 5 other key covers breaking and almost losing the key.  The cat reminds me of one I used to have.  :)"
5.0,"I loveeeeee it , I bought a green and the color is very nice. I am saving that dress for a date 😍😍."
5.0,I love these glasses. Definitely a must have.
5.0,"The wallet is beautiful, in perfect new condition and had Kate Spade tags intact."
5.0,Love them. The smaller ones can be worn with anything.
5.0,"I bought this to capture heart rate during my bike rides, but it's comfortable enough that I wear it most times. I don't have to worry about sweating on it when I'm working, discoloration, etc. But it's so easy to change to a leather band to go out to dinner if I want to. I'd buy it again."
5.0,"The length is good as well """
5.0,"I love the way this looks and feels! The only thing I don't like is the padding, but I took it out."
5.0,Fit perfect and she loved them
5.0,"Thank you, it fits well with my everyday life, I wasn't quite sure how it turned out. It does clash with other jewelry that I tend to wear."
5.0,"This stuff works great. I have a wool hat. It took a few coats, but nowhere near the whole bottle."
5.0,"Everything I wanted, gteat merchandise<br /> Wish there were more beaded included, but very  nice!"
5.0,Band is thicker and smooth. Feels good. I hadn’t noticed that there was apparently a longer pair of pins in the package. The longer ones worked better. You can also easily take the pins out of your present band without difficulty and replace.
5.0,"Bliz Matrix Nordic Light enhances the contrasts, like a Oakley Prizm or a Smith ChromaPop.  Lenses are very clear.<br /><br />The nose pad and the rubber earsocks are comfortable.  Glasses are light.<br /><br />Works well with MTB and road helmets."
5.0,Fit great on 3 Yr old
5.0,Looks great with jeans or leggings and I am tall.  Hits me at thigh level.
5.0,"At first I thought it was too small, but I was actually wearing it wrong..lol but it fits well and looks pretty good. There's a slit in the back to make for easy slip ins and offs, and long hair is easily tucked away inside the mask. Honestly I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I'm actually really happy with what I have."
5.0,"They are so cute, my son loves them! The case is nice too"
5.0,I love this dress. The length is a little longer than most of my maxis but I just wear my wedge sandals and it's fine. The color is beautiful and the pockets are great!
5.0,Very comfortable and strong zipper pockets really make these workout or just lounging pants a great buy
5.0,"Oh, boy, have I ever got to get myself some more of these. I am 4'11&#34; and sixtysomething. A little over a year ago, I weighed 208 lbs. and am now 82 lbs. lighter. Figuring out what size to wear in clothes and getting things that look good on me even as I keep shrinking has been a real challenge. When I was offered a pair of these leggings at a discount in return for my honest review, I decided to get a small (which comes closest to my hip measurement) instead of a medium (to fit my waist) because I know I'll be losing a little more weight. I am SO glad I got the smaller size! I don't think I would have liked the medium size at all. I thought when I first pulled them out of the wrapper that I'd made a big mistake, because they looked positively tiny and I thought I'd never be able to get into them. But they stretched right out to fit me like a glove but also cover really well.<br /><br />Other leggings I've had have been either too baggy on me or too tight in some places and too loose in others. These fit incredibly well all over, even at my waist. They are very smooth and don't pill at all, and they don't pick up as much lint as the others do. In fact, with the exception of the model's gorgeous flat belly, these leggings look EXACTLY on me like the do on the model. The length is the same (I've got short little legs) and my lower body even looks like that. (Do you know how good that feels after being a SIZE 18?) And they make me look toned and fit, even though the skin on my thighs is pretty saggy after losing so much.<br /><br />I do fitness walking and indoor cycling. These leggings are very comfortable for both activities. They are warm, but warm like my skin might be warm; they feel like they are a part of me. I've tested some compression products designed to keep your knees warm and massaged while walking to avoid injury, and I really don't see why these would not do the same job if you get a snug enough fit as I did.<br /><br />I'm really thinking these are at least partially made out of bamboo (a cotton/bamboo blend, probably), because they are very similar in feel—wonderful—to a few bamboo tops I have.They wash up the same, too. I hand-wash all of my clothes except bedding because we don't have easy access to a washing machine where I live. I have some Yummy Tummy leggings I got last year on eBay that are a whole heck of a lot easier to wash by hand than denim jeans are, but these Hoveox leggings are even easier and drip dry really quickly.<br /><br />Speaking of bamboo, I read on Wikipedia, I think it was, that in the U.S. bamboo items must be labeled as polyester, but polyester sounds so fake and man-made, unlike bamboo, which is a renewable resource and biodegradable to boot. I hope I'm right that these are made of bamboo. I hope the vendor will include more specifics on the product on the product page, including inches for measurements to help American buyers. And I don't think I'd make the same recommendation some others here have to buy up a size. These leggings have ample stretch, so I'd say go with the size that most of your measurements fit the best and don't worry too much if one area is a bit larger than what is stated. I'm really glad I fit to my hips."
5.0,Very cute top. Everyone I work with had a good laugh with the design but loved it.
5.0,Classic and Elegant

5.0,"BEST BRA EVER! I totally love that it provides awesome lift, is wirefree, comfortable, provides full coverage - no side boobs no nothing, everywhere securely covered. I am more than blown away by the High impact sports support that it provides, I am finally able to do my jumps as well as all my other high intensity exercises while having my boobs firmly secured by this bra that costs so little. It is a dual-purpose bra, I use mine for everyday dressing as well as for sports. Honestly, I can't get enough of this bra, I plan on getting 5 more when it is back in stock, as I plan on using it for sleeping too because of how comfortable it is.<br />N/B IT DOESN'T RUN SMALL, RUNS TRUE TO SIZE  - FOLLOW THE SELLER'S CHART AND MEASURE YOURSELF RIGHT BEFORE  PLACING YOUR ORDER LIKE I DID."
5.0,"These are extremely cheap but very colorful shoes. More like slippers. But, Minnie wins the show and our youngest grand daughter loved them"
5.0,These eyeglass pouches are very cute.  The material is soft and durable.  The pouches are a decent size.  They hold even my large Elton John sunglasses.
5.0,"This dress is beautiful!! I was a little skeptical about buying a dress like this online without trying it on, but it fits amazing!! I am 5’8 125lbs and I went with a size medium. Usually dresses tend to be short on me, but this is the perfect length!!"

5.0,Received many complements!!
5.0,I love this choker its got a nice clasp and is a wonderful acent piece furthermore I love the fact it has a little weight it's very well made
5.0,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter who has a thin build and they were perfect!<br /><br />The material felt great and was good quality for a great price. The color was bright and as pictured.<br />Sizing was what I expected. She is 5' tall and weighs about 90lbs so I ordered the small and it fit perfect with a little extra room so they weren't tight which was the goal<br /><br />We will be buying more!
5.0,I purchased them for every day wear and they’re perfect for that purpose.
5.0,Envío Rápido y Excelente calidad!
5.0,"This is a great shirt as a cover up or with skinny jeans/leggings.  Ordered a M/L after reading other reviews  stating this shirt has a generous cut.  Just a little loose at the shoulders, but so comfortable!  I am 5 7 and 136 lbs."

5.0,"After having this watch for a month, accuracy is around +5 seconds/day. This  falls on COSC (chronometer ) standard of +6/-4 per day. For comparison, I have an Orient bambino which is only accurate at around +10 to +20  seconds per day based on my experience.  I like the thin profile and the long lugs with drilled holes which makes it easy for you to change nato/zulu straps or a different strap. I also like the matte finish as it projects a subtle and simple look as opposed to polished blingy finish ( Probably , an acquired taste but this is how I love it ). Also,  this watch resembles the gg-w-113 military watch ( Vietnam era )  and has a great history.<br /><br />Like:<br />-Affordable<br />-Great Quality<br />-Swiss Made ETA 2801-2 Hand Wind Movement<br />-Oversize Crown for easy winding<br />-Bead blasted finish<br />-Time only - easy to set on the go. ( compared to watches with date, you don't have to think AM/PM and can set the time faster ).<br />-Decent Lume - Superliminova<br />-Vintage look with great 38 mm size. Wears bigger in spite of the smaller size because of the long lug length<br />-Sapphire Crystal ( have a slight dome on it )<br />-High Beat movement of 28800 BPH - seconds hand moves very smooth<br /><br />Dislike:<br />-Strap could be longer but should not be an issue for those with smaller wrist<br />-No AR coating ( reflective crystal)<br /><br />Update :<br />There are two movements for these watch.

5.0,THESE EARRINGS ARE BEAUTIFUL.  THEY LOOK VERY EXPENSIVE AND NOT GAUDY THE WAY SOME BIGGER CARAT EARRINGS DO. i lOVE THEM.
5.0,Very nice hat. It feels very good to the skin and that is very important for me because I shave my head and I can't tolerate acrylic or cheap material.....affordable and good looking.
5.0,This was a gift.  The dad loved it.  He said it is always a reminder.  He does carry it in his wallet.
5.0,I bought these to complete a jewelry set that I have.  These match beautifully!
5.0,I really like the comfort and fit of these.  Also bought them for my grown daughters.  👍🏻
5.0,This is for my daughter she loves it!
5.0,"Great push up. Not too much, but just enough to make the ladies look perky again post babies. Perfect fit and doesn't look too ""fake"""
5.0,I bought the earrings for myself and they are so cute! I’ve gotten lots of compliments and they are a good size. I read some reviews of people claiming they were really small but I think they are a good size. They take up most of my ear lobe. Really like them so far.
5.0,Perfect babydoll dress! I’m 5’6” normally wears a medium. Purchased a large for the size and it’s great!!
5.0,This is absolutely perfect!! Couldn't ask for better and at a very good price! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to complete a Mad Hatter costume!
5.0,"Well made, nice fit, and stylish. Gun on front is a patch sewn on, the sides GSG-5 are orange stitched in, and the back is plain (tuck in adjustable strap, clamp hold kind). I'll take it shooting even if I don't bring my gsg 522 sd with me."
5.0,i am in love with this dress. I wear a slip underneath because the material is see through a little bit. I kick it up with some doc martens and it perfect. I love the floral pattern. Great and very light for summertime. i received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review
5.0,Very cute and true to size. Bought in this style and short sleeve version. I decided to keep the one with shorter sleeves just because I thought I'd get more wear out of it. Love the cut and style of both dresses.
5.0,Comfortable and cozy robe. My 10 year old loves to put it on after taking a shower.
5.0,"He loves the color, design and says it's comfortable- high praise indeed!"
5.0,Very nice. I like the fleece lining in the gloves and fun fact: I took those pictures on my phone while wearing the gloves just to prove that you can wear them and use a touch screen. Prefect for cold weather!  The design is pretty and they go with everything.
5.0,"My best friend really loved it, so did I."
5.0,Love love love this necklace!!!
5.0,"This is one anti-fog spray that is all it's cracked up to be. I sprayed my sunglasses, put on my mask, and headed out for a six-mile walk. Not once in nearly 3 hours did I have to stop and de-fog my glasses. And bonus: I took a walk the following day, forgot to spray, but found that I didn't need to; the spray lasted two days! I'm relieved to find a product that does what it say it will do. Thank you!"
5.0,My wife loved them. Taking on our cruise to Alaska
5.0,"We had some miscommunication on the pants size I think because the pants were too small but I was promptly sent the right size pants as a replacement. Everything else fit just fine and the quality was great for cosplay purposes. The robe is very thick and heavy (I don't mean uncomfortable) as in well built and very screen accurate.<br /><br />This is an update to my original review, I have added a star based on the results of my 1st official field test at Megacon, I received a ton of requests for photos and everyone said I looked amazing. The level of response and complements I got far exceeded my expectations, I was there for many hours and I was very comfortable as well. If you're a fan then buy it here with confidence"
5.0,"Got this for my youngest to match her big sisters and she LOVES it. Doubt she will take it off, which means it's perfect for her! Very comfortable and fits her perfectly! Will probably get her the shark one next since that's her favorite animal!"
5.0,Very comfortable<br />Great purchase
5.0,Love these perfect for.
5.0,It makes your luggage very easy to spot and I received great comments from people standing in line behind me. They all thought it's cool.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:cddffda6a694b25fa0ecf4e3b9e4c55d]] Comfy, easy to use, warm and thin. The touchscreen works great!"
5.0,I got green and I love it. Go with green
5.0,"Great product, fitbit fits in it perfectly.  Looks nice on also."
5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SUIT!!!! SO HOT ON!!! Ordered this suit because I leave in 3 days to the Bahamas and I've looked for high waisted swimming suits everywhere! Was scared to take the chance on ordering online but I'm glad I did! Plus it came in two days! I waited till the last minute to finally order it because I couldn't find anything I liked in the stores...AMAZON PRIME IS THE BOMB!!! Only thing is the bottoms to this suit are a little big but nothing too crazy, just going to throw them in the dryer once and they should be fine! My weight is 168 and I'm 5'5 or 5'6 and I ordered the 2x because I was reading what the sizes are and I usually wear size 10 in pants but I'm in between sizes right now since I've been losing weight! Can't wait to go swimming in the Bahamas with this baby! :D"
5.0,"I have worn them for an entire week, or in my case four, ten hour work days. They are perfect and keep my feet dry. I work with water and they keep my feet dry and comfortable.  I was hesitant to purchase them. Ordering shoes on line is scary.  Will they fit? Will they be too ⁹heavy and make my legs tired? Are they going to hurt my sore knee? This is all the things I think about. I wear a size seven. They are light enough that they almost feel like sneakers. They don't hurt my knee.  The only downside too them is I leave them at work because of the grease from the trucks.<br /><br />Side note.... I did add another inner sole. On top of the stock. Just because I like all my shoes with a little more cushion.<br /><br />I say try them. You may like them.<br /><br />Edit: I still wear them to work. Everyday. Got them in August and it's now November and I still like them. My job has changed but I still need steel toe. They are still just as comfortable as ever."
5.0,"When I saw the color of this purse, I just knew I had to have it. I have the perfect pair of boots that matches it perfectly. I had been having trouble finding a purse that I liked that matched it, well until now. I love that little zipper pocket in the back. My husband is military and I always have to have an ID card  ready to show any time I go near a military base, so this pocket is just perfect to have it ready in an instant.<br /> This is a leather tote bag or it may be called  a large purse. To me it is the perfect size. I ordered the tan bag but it comes in 6 different colors. It is a really soft PU leather. The bag itself is tan with gold hardware. It has 2 hard handles at the top of the bag for carrying it that are gold on the outside with black on the inside of the handle, so they are a two tone. You can also carry this purse  on your shoulder with a long tan strap that is also removable. The bottom of the front of the purse has 16 gold studs..8 on each corner. There is a zipper pocket on the back side of this purse. The inside of the purse has a tan paisley lining that is very pretty.  This is a 3 compartment purse. 2 big compartments divided in the center by a zipper compartment. One of the big compartments has a zipper pocket in it and the other big compartment ha 2 pockets on the side. This purse is very stylish and classy looking and I am so very pleased with it.<br />Thank you for giving me the chance to review such a great bag at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0,"These clip on/flip up sunglasses worked and fit like I wanted.  The mechanism fits my glasses and it only took a short amount of time getting used to it. I am aware that something is above the rim of my glasses, but it doesn't bother me.  The sunglasses height are slightly longer than my prescription glasses, but it makes it easy to flip them up when driving in cloudy or shady areas as well as making a quick trip into a store.  Although I was hesitant in ordering these on-line,  (couldn't find any in local stores to fit my glasses) I was happy with the information on how to measure and am happy with the fit.  The clip is rubberized, so it doesn't not scratch my lenses. Very sturdy, easy to work and easy to put on and remove."
5.0,Love this scarf color beautiful size and weight good
5.0,"I bought two, and I'm happy I did.  One is a gift, and it's cute enough to put a bow on.  I'd probably order 2 more if they came in a left and a right!  They're hefty, so I'm hoping the cats won't knock it down easily.<br />Update-ordering a replacement because I dropped it. It was tough to clean and needed a refresh anyway (I couldn't get the dust off)."
5.0,Very comfortable and warm.  So soft inside.
5.0,"I bought 6 of these and gave them as gifts.<br />I LOVE the ones I bought for myself too. This brand in particular was better than the other couple brands of scarf that I tried. Very nice material, love it!"
5.0,"Long and wonderful, amazing  😉"
5.0,I liked it. Real cute.
5.0,there awesome
5.0,Love this suit. It really does make me look thinner. My husband absolutely adores it. I’m not young anymore but this suit will make you feel sexy.
5.0,It came just as pictures and is so beautiful considering the cheap price! I wear it a lot and have not seen any signs of it being damaged or worn out. 10/10 would recommend this to a friend or someone in my family.
5.0,"It's very nice, I walk everyday and it's warm, and it looks cute."
5.0,You need to watch the video to understand how to put it on your wrist but when you get it on it fits wonderfully and looks so cute. I will be getting more bands.
5.0,Granddaughters loved them!  They made items with them!
5.0,Excatly what I expected.
5.0,Gorgeous!! Good  material
5.0,"quick ship- cute bag,"
5.0,"I love my new bag, it is roomy and just what I need"
5.0,i received this a week ago.  great stuff.  everything is tight on this - meaning doesn't seem like there was any stitch out of place.  good substantial material.  i bought this patch to put on the arm of my winter parka.  it had a velcro brand name of the coat patch on it which i promptly replaced with is one .. although it's like 2mm smaller but it looks great.<br /><br />what i also love about this patch is its ambiguity - sure STAR WARS is ubiquitous in the 20th and 21st centuries of our time but only TRUE STAR WARS FAN will know what this patch is.<br /><br />it's a bold patch - yet subtle - Bold for those in the 'know' - subtle and confounding to casual fans and non-fans.<br /><br />too bad the winter hasn't been bad enough for me to wear the jacket more than 3x this winter.. darn you globalwarming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />PS - i had to put on the velcro to the back of this myself.
5.0,"These were bought for Christmas gifts, the recipients loved them, said they were made well, and looked attractive on their wrists, not to mention after they added their favorite essential oil, it stayed with them all day!"
5.0,Very cute and stylish. Hasn't gotten stuck yet and it has stood up to a couple of really windy days. The extra black lining on the inside provides great sun protection.
5.0,Comfortable and warm but not too heavy. Great jacket!
5.0,"Cuter than expected for the low Price! Great detail, fit is perfect"
5.0,I got a medium - I'm 5'3&#34; 125lbs with long legs (29&#34; inseam) for my height. Very stretchy and fit as expected.  Comfy too.
5.0,Great looking shirt but not true to size.  Need to size up.
5.0,Love love! I have kind of wide feet due to some bunion issue and these are just lovely! Just like all other sofft shoes they are very comfortable. Wore them shopping for a while first time and no break in needed.
5.0,"I love this pajama set! They’re really cute- I love the white on the neck and wrists- and fit perfectly. The material is nice and warm, and fuzzy on the outside AND inside. Plus, I like the front pocket. Pjs with pockets can be hard to find. I work from home and these will get a lot of use!"
5.0,"Love this purse, light, small and just the right length."
5.0,Sized up from an 8G to 6G and the change was perfect. The balls are large and comfortable and keep from slipping in my pee hole with my PA piercing.

5.0,It was super soft and comfy
5.0,"Good quality , I like the style,usually all neck Wallets look not great, usually I am use it with my belt and its fit well!"
5.0,"I'm a 5'1 girl weighing 115 pounds, and the small fit me perfectly. The colors are definitely navy blue and red. It's very nice, flowy and elegant. I needed it for a New Year's office party. Can't wait to wear it officially!"
5.0,I loved it and so did my daughter that I gave it to😁 it was beautiful just as I seen online thanks guys ill be talking and buying more soon
5.0,"Go buy this dress right now! I searched for a long time for a dress for my wedding shower and let me tell you, this dress blew me away! It for in all the best places and I got compliments from everyone on this dress. I loved the material, not itchy at all with the lace, and plenty of stretch. I’m a bit busty and was worried about my boobs slipping out but it covered them well. If you are a bit more endowed up top, you might want to consider a cami underneath. I’m 190lbs, 36DDD, and bought a size large. The length was awesome I didn’t have to worry about flashing anyone and enjoyed when I sat down the fabric was flowy not tight. I’m definitely wearing this again and again and again."
5.0,"I had bought a dress without realizing it was off the shoulder, so I got a strapless bra and this tube top as a backup. I'm glad I did, because the strapless bra slipped into a really unappealing shape.  I'm small-breasted, and the tube top was completely adequate for providing light support, and not see-through at all. Also, it's quite comfortable. The only thing I would really improve is that it ought to widen more as it goes down toward the hips. If I don't tuck it in, it rides up my belly. I might buy the same thing in the shorter version to see if it works better, but the long one is quite workable."
5.0,"I recieved them very quick and they were just what i expected, i love them"
5.0,Great item with a beautiful saying. It meaningful. Small enough to keep in the pocket and looks to be of good quality
5.0,Pretty and soft
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:eae81cd86b5e497840e7de4c75741c15]] I love chronograph watches, especially big face ones. It can be worn for work and play. The band is genuine leather with great stitching. Because it is Quartz, it is quite. There is no tech with this watch. So you don’t have Bluetooth or anything like that. It is waterproof and makes a great gift for men on any occasion. This one is a keeper. Comes with a 90 day money back guarantee with a 1 year warranty."
5.0,"LOVE these leggings. Just ordered 3 more! The crop leggings are definitely a better choice because they are more like ankle fit, so I know the regular length would be too long. The material is so comfortable, not see through at all, and great for work outs. I'm 5'5&#34; and 145 pounds, larger in the hip/butt area and the medium is a perfect fit. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Looove!
5.0,I love this shirt.  The fit is really flattering.  I bought a second shirt in purple and one for my daughter.  We both agree that the fabric is soft and comfortable.

5.0,I love the fit very cute dress
5.0,"Shirt fits kinda small, normally i wear an XL and had to get a XXL in this. It is totally cute though, if you have a large stomach it will make it look much slimmer! I also really love the ribbed t-shit type material it is made out of!"
5.0,GREAT VALUE
5.0,"This bracelet is well made and looks very nice on my husband.  He has big wrists and it's hard to find a nice bracelet big enough.  This one is snug, but not too tight. Good buy!"
5.0,"Beyond a shadow of a doubt-- best drunk purchase of 2013. Drunk or sober-- 10/10 would buy again.<br />Also, its soft. Soft like a sloth."
5.0,"The size is perfect for the multiple piercings I have in my ears, and never get caught on anything or irritate the skin. I've been wearing them almost non-stop since I bought them. They went in easily and the closures are secure but open when needed."
5.0,"Already have the dress in another print. Fits great! I'm 5'8"" and a size 10..<br />Large perfect"
5.0,"These are very great, I love them. I wear a size 12 and, after reading the reviews, I ordered a size 3XL. They looked really big when I opened them up out of the package, but they actually fit comfortably. Not too big, not too tight - they fit perfectly, no complaints. They come about half way up my stomach, slightly lower in the back. They dont slide down while walking, doing cardio, nor pilates. They're great, I'm really pleased with them."
5.0,My husband enjoyed wearing these on Halloween to scare all the little kids.  Hahahaha
5.0,I wore this to complete mt BTS outfit and it fit perfectly
5.0,"Great bra - no movement, great support."
5.0,"Love it! I have a huge head so I had to stretch it out a bit, but it's amazing and super cute and versatile."
5.0,great. the clamps are far better than the button style i'm accustomed to.
5.0,"My neck did not show as others thought may be the case.  I guess if you don't plan ahead and wear a scoop neck with it yours might.<br /><br />It was a bit difficult to breathe the first five minutes or so, but that passed and it was smooth sailing from then on out.<br /><br />The eyes are very far apart and you can only really see out of one at a time, and then only by tilting your head to the side; however, tilting your head to the side gives the mask a bit more ominous of a feeling.<br /><br />I wore it with a cardboard cut of a soda pull tab wrapped in foil around my leg and a fake soda six pack cut out of clear plastic painting tarp.  Now that it is my Facebook profile picture, people are being freaked out well past Halloween..."
5.0,"Order a size up. I wear size 4 and the size 6 was TIGHT around the rib cage, but workable. A bit big in the bust too. But it looked great and the fabric is lovely, will last for years. Check your monitor settings, but this dress is PURPLE. A lovely deep purple. Not blue."
5.0,MY DAUGHTER LOVES HER EDDIE MUNSON INSPIRED WATCH
5.0,Very pretty locket.  The only thing that I would change are the chains I'm having to replace them with better chains.
5.0,It's worth every penny.
5.0,Beautiful!  On time and perfect.
5.0,"Super comfy!  I don't have much of an endowment so I don't know how these would work for a girl with a bigger chest, but great from my perspective.  Bought two more in different colors."
5.0,Gf loves it
5.0,These were really comfortable and durable.  No band marks!
5.0,"nice material, pretty colors.  Fit my daughter well"
5.0,BEAUTIFUL BATHING SUIT! I WOULD BUY IT IN EVERY COLOR!
5.0,"I’ve bought 3 pairs at this point. Extremely pleased with this product! Take care of them. They are delicate. Very comfortable and I’ve worn them to a few places with good results. Head turner, conversation starter. 5 stars all the way. Love em."
5.0,We love the socks.
5.0,"I love, love, love these shirts! Got these for our one-year anniversary and they are super cute! The small fit me great, the medium fits well on my hubby, but a little snug in the armpits - still doesn't keep us from wearing them. of course we love to wear them together! They are well made. The women's is pretty thin material, but they are both soft and the print on them is great. They've been washed a few times now and they hold up just fine in the wash.<br /><br />Super cute and love really love them.. did I mention that?"
5.0,This top is super cute. The material is comfy and has a satin sheen to it (but it’s still soft). I love the pink blush color. It provides good coverage in the bust area so I don’t need a bra with it.
5.0,I was worried about the size since these are only available in One Size Fits All and I was at the higher end of the chart for height/weight.  They fit surprisingly well and even have some extra room in the waistband.
5.0,This umbrella is better than I expected. The canvas is not flimsy and the lights are just enough for a cozy setting. You won't be dissappointed with this product!
5.0,This visor fits perfect I love the sparkle❣
5.0,"[[ASIN:B00NOA44E6 Florida Gators Fans. Jameis' Famous Crab Shack Orange T-Shirt (Large)]]<br />Love this shirt. Fits as expected. I'm female so the only drawback was that it was a little snug in the hips, but it could stand to reason that I just need to work out a little more! All my Gator fan friends and family have already commented on how funny the shirt is and asked where I got it. It's a good quality material. I have already washed it twice, and it is standing up very well. It isn't the cheap fabric you sometimes encounter with some T-shirts. Did not shrink at all in the wash either. This is great for Gators fans!"
5.0,Its such a good dress for both office and casual occasions. I got compliments through out my first day of wearing it
5.0,"very basic watch that will last you, the straps last about a year till they start wearing out and breaking off. Then its on to the next one"
5.0,Perfect! Adjustable length necklace and quality pendant for the price. I am satisfied.
5.0,Quick delivery highest quality hats
5.0,"I get compliments on this dress every time I wear it. I dress for efficiency and being comfortable, so it’s a plus when this is also stylish. I use this dress as a nightgown or for going out to pick up kids and errands. For what I paid for it and how many hundred of times I’ve worn it, it’s a purchase I don’t regret."
5.0,Love this hat.
5.0,Love it very much.
5.0,These fit great.  Way better then the blue disposable masks. Love the fact you can change the filter.
5.0,"Love it, it's warm and comfortable"
5.0,"The clips are perfect. They fit a 2&#34; barbel nice and snug, but are easy to put on. The clip is not tough to set, but holds the plates very securely. Even when doing drop-weight deadlifts, these do not budge! Highly recommended."
5.0,"My husband enjoyed these. He and some friends wore ""Christmas"" socks together!"
5.0,Great product well made worn alot
5.0,Nice design. Chain with the pendant is too thin. Broke after a couple of times of use. I contacted the seller and the were ready to give a refund. But my  Wife decided to keep it after replacing the chain. Would but from this seller again.
5.0,The color was exactly what I was hoping for!
5.0,Love these they are very comfortable and they hide the bulges & pouches. They actually smooth out all the imperfections! I will be buying these again. You can’t see thru these like the others and also no camel toe to be seen . They are great ! I got the long and mid calf ones .
5.0,I can’t tell you how may compliments I’ve received on this sweater!  It’s lightweight enough to wear a cami or t-shirt underneath but warm enough to take the chill off on a cool day or indoors with the air conditioner running!  I ordered a large so I could have extra room to wear a variety of shirts underneath. It’s lightweight and not bulky and doesn't give you that “heavy look”.
5.0,Cute.  I like that it fits over my wrist like a bracelet.
5.0,"After reading reviews about poor sizing and length being too long, I tried to cancel. Order was already in transit so it couldn't be canceled. I'm happy it wasn't canceled because these are just what I was looking for, and the sizing is great. I'm trying to shrink my holes and needed lightweight plugs. These are perfect, especially at the price. I can even glue on gems if I'm feeling anything other than simple :)"
5.0,Its super cute and great quality!!! Highly recommend it.
5.0,"Nice size, color"
5.0,"This shirt is super cute and a good quality. If you want it to fit as pictured I suggest going up one size. I normally wear a size small and got a medium in this and it looks like it does in the picture. The quality is better and thicker than I thought it would be, the color is pretty."
5.0,Running
5.0,"High quality, better than I expected honestly. Sturdy, thick but not too thick. Really pleased. Out of my recent orders this is one of the only things I haven’t had any issues with."
5.0,Love it fits just right.
5.0,Love them and they are gorgeous
5.0,Purchased as a gift. Very nice.
5.0,"The boys XL fits fine, I usually wear women’s medium.  It is good quality, I have no complaints."
5.0,Muy ajustada pero hermosa 😞
5.0,Awesome product and seller.
5.0,"This is a great belt, but it runs way big.  I have been a 40""/42"" waist size for 20 years, but had to cut 6"" off this belt (pin buckle belt).  It came with a punch and instructions so it was pretty easy to adjust, but why make them so big?"
5.0,Dainty & shiny. It's even more beautiful in person.
5.0,Bought this for myself and super glad I did! It shipped fast and I've worn it everyday since it arrived. It's a great peice. I love it. I plan on keeping the card it came with. It is beautiful. I will be a repeat customer for sure!
5.0,"Nice soft material,  I wouldn't mind having more shirts this soft"
5.0,Muy buenas gafas
5.0,Top Quality
5.0,Really great quality for the price!  The material is really nice and the color is true to the picture. I just wish it wasn't a faux wrap. If I could tie it tighter I wouldn't have such an issue with the wind blowing the skirt open.
5.0,"I bought these as a gift, she loves em."
5.0,"my 11 and 8 year olds love these. they do fog a little bit while out on the slopes for a while, other than that they are quite comfortable and at a great price"
5.0,Fits perfectly. Lightweight but not see through. One of my favorite dresses.
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Lightweight, great coverage, fit well."
5.0,I’m a curvy lady. I’m normally a 1x. The first time after reading reviews I bought a XXXL. It was huge on me. I returned it and bought a XXL. It’s fitting on top comfortably. The arms aren’t tight. The lower half doesn’t cling at all and lose. The material is not thin. I bought the blue and it’s even prettier when I got it. I will be buying additional tops. Im really happy I bought this! I hope this review helps you to be comfortable as a plus size lady to be able to find something cute!!
5.0,Comfortable and machine wash
5.0,Great quality & great price compared to other similar styles. Added a bolero for the evening event that will be held outdoors later this month.
5.0,"Use it for everyday use, when sunny outside."
5.0,"I was not sure that these compression stockings would fit or be what I needed, but they are.  I love the colors & plan to order more."
5.0,"My son used this for a costume for school- he was DogMan.  It fit really well.  The plastic has a strange smell, but we were able to air it out."
5.0,I absolutely LOVE it!  Good quality at a great value.  Thank you!  I'd recommend and will probably buy more.
5.0,For the price..this is a perfect scarf
5.0,Ok...I have to say that I look  marvelous in my glasses
5.0,"Great fabric, cute design, I would have bought it one size up but worth the buy. Lots of compliments and now my new lake shirt."
5.0,Nephew loved this. Package and product was great
5.0,Came as advertised and the quality is what I expected.
5.0,"Came in fast and the quality is outstanding, I love them!"
5.0,"Solid, beautiful leather, I can see this lasting for years. The stitches are solid, the thickness and feel, lets you know money was spent on this belt. It’s a gorgeous belt. For dress or everyday use. Classic style goes with anything with belt loops. Doesn’t disappoint."
5.0,"Super comfortable, prevents blistering, and are still looking good after many wears and washes."
5.0,Noce dress
5.0,My son looks great in the shirt
5.0,"I could find nothing negative about this product, except it takes a about a month to get it from china. The fabric is light weight and comfortable. It is very well made, could find no flaws. I wear a medium and ordered a medium the fit is perfect. As for value for money, it truly is I own several hoodies like this all of which cost 2 to 3 times as much.<br />I will order again."
5.0,"Great fit, fit exactly as expected. This type of sweater does have a tighter neck so just be aware of that. I popped a few threads to get it over my big head and caused no problems. Overall awesome quality."
5.0,I love this set i got really great value and love the look of these pieces for my man. amazing
5.0,I was skeptical about this type of sandal because they would give me blisters as a kid. but my daughter is doing great in them and always grabs them when we say to get ready to go bye bye
5.0,"What an amazing pair of pants.  I want them in more colors.  I am hard to fit - big tummy, no behind, and skinny stick legs.  5' 7&#34; 240lbs apple shape.  usually tight fitting pants like these are NOT flattering.  But I got compliments the first day I wore these.  I bought them for the gym because I wanted a high waisted pant that would move with me.  Well these do!  I had no idea how well constructed and polished they were.  I am buying another pair for work.  PLEASE.....I want color options..........."
5.0,Nice winter fleece.
5.0,So very glad I bought these... three are not enough... will be buying more. A great addition to my bracelet. 😊
5.0,Can't wait for the slides to come out so I can get those too
5.0,A little loose but SO comfortable! The insides of the sleeves are soft and kinda fuzzy! My new favorite Christmas shirt!
5.0,Very well made; soft &#34;leather&#34; that is very nice; spacious inside with various pockets. Great!
5.0,I love it! It goes perfectly with the matching leggings my boyfriend bought me!
5.0,She loved them! Very soft and oh so cute!
5.0,"I'm not real crazy about the dress, but I needed something from the 40's for a concert I'm in."
5.0,Super comfy. The material is very soft. It fits my daughter perfectly and looks very nice on her
5.0,I'm a bag lady
5.0,"Perfect, arrived faster than expected. Very pleased."
5.0,Fit well for 5k
5.0,My wife loves this.  Fit her very nicely.  Use a size up and you will be good
5.0,"Super cute and stylish. They match many, if not all outfits, (for my personal style and opinion) and super comfortable and warm in the cold nights or even winter and rainy days. They fit perfectly to size. They seem pretty durable for outdoor use like on trails, dirt, grass, etc. Highly recommend!!"
5.0,I bought this necklace for my niece's golden &#34;8th&#34; birthday. I thought it was perfect for a younger child. She loved it!
5.0,"Got these as gifts for my fiancés bachelor party and I put them in their goody bags. Fiancé says these are the most comfortable socks for him, he loves them!!"
5.0,Le encantó a mi nieta. No se la quita!
5.0,These are awesome wish it had a pocket but they are still amazing
5.0,Love these leggings. They are very opaque and fit great. I wear them everywhere!
5.0,"I ordered this jade bracelet to go with a beautifully designed light green jade amulet that I also ordered. It's light green in color, simply designed,  fits my fairly small wrist perfectly and matches my amulet."
5.0,Beautiful light weight.
5.0,"If you want to heal your piercings these are perfect for the girls. I got them because I heard titanium is good for that. Way better than getting something from the mall that is just surgical steel. The smaller ones fit nice for the nips but its a little hard to clean, overall it’s pretty and I recommend. They have a flat backing so it’s not a round ball."
5.0,"5*, Item as described, packed professionally and shipped promptly"
5.0,"Very cute, love the huge spikes. arrived on time. thin material, but not bad quality"
5.0,"Bought this for my grandson, he wears a medium and said that this fits as expected. He also liked the charcoal gray color."
5.0,Very cute dress fits perfect I ordered a size up in order to achieve the perfect fit for the look I had visioned comfortable fabric feels great not too short overall a good purchase must have for upcoming holidays
5.0,Good quality bag and very fashionable! Large enough to fit my daily travel materials. The long strap is great. This bag could be used for a man or woman.
5.0,So cute and girly
5.0,Great fit... Shipped as promised!
5.0,Works great thick pages individual top slide in slots
5.0,Great gift for a stocking stuffer!
5.0,Cheap but very loose over your own glasses but will work for what I for need them
5.0,Very soft and good quality
5.0,I love it ... ❤❤❤
5.0,Love love!!! My totally fav yoga pants!!!!:-)
5.0,Had to return husband upset-bought bigger size.
5.0,"Fits well, size was spot on."
5.0,"Lots of compliments every time I wear this! Love the high waisted design, which creates a slimming effect."
5.0,Very pretty. Giving this to my massage graduate who is graduating. Delivery was super fast
5.0,"I lose my noserings like nobody's business. I'm talking every other day on average. Does anyone else have this problem? On top of that, each nose also requires a different style -- my left needs a straight pin and the right needs an L-shape.<br /><br />Well, I've tried everything and the only thing that works is having A TON of backup replacement studs on hand. So far, this is the best deal that I have been able to find on Amazon. The pack comes with 16 pieces which at my rate, will last me about a month. This is an easy solution for me that doesn't break the bank. The shipping was fast and the packaging was nicely sealed and protected. They are made of hypoallergenic stainless steel and has a nice smooth finish. The crystal is a very modest size, not overdoing it with the bling on my face.<br /><br />I would recommend this product!"
5.0,"My love loves this scarf. The length is perfect, the colors are grey with a touch of red and black, and the material is soft and comfortable. The beads make it classier than most scarfs, and as a result, she will wear it both in dressy situations and casual ones. It goes perfectly with her black dresses, red dresses and grey dresses, so she is very pleased."
5.0,A lovely addition to my Pandora bracelet. Bought one for my best friend also!
5.0,"This is much prettier in person, beautiful!"
5.0,"Received the quartz, rose quartz, and amethyst crystals in the metal wraps as depicted. Size, shape, and color will vary, so do not buy this if you are picky about the look. I just wanted crystal pendants that would not fall out. I was not particular about the exact look. The metalwork feels sturdy and secure."
5.0,Fit as I expected. Like the color.
5.0,I purchased this for my 6 yr old grandson. He loves ties. Sometimes will even have one on with a t-shirt. This tie is good quality. I know he will love it.
5.0,"Excellent item, fit Pandora perfectly.  Would recommend to other fans."
5.0,I love turquoise jewelry..Great deal and it didn't take long for it to arrive.I am very pleased.
5.0,Usefull
5.0,This dress is super cute and super flattering! I love it.
5.0,Love these! Need more of them!
5.0,Keeps my son warm water proof
5.0,Absolutely love this purse great quality.
5.0,everyone keeps asking me where I got such a crafted watch.
5.0,Good fit! Form fitting but not tight. Not too short either
5.0,[[VIDEOID:ae03be4c9603edc9d386e200d1952da6]]
5.0,Very nice product!  Came promptly.  Can also be used for travel shampoo and lotion.
5.0,"Love, Love, Love these glasses.  very fashionable. Very sturdy construction.  Large size.  People ask me where I purchased the.  Would buy again."
5.0,My daughter loves these socks!
5.0,"These are really nice and fit my face well. I have a short, small face so it can be difficult to find a flattering pair of sunglasses. They provide good protection from the sun. I highly recommend them."
5.0,Love these tops! Have them in 5 colors
5.0,Warm. Fits nice and after one wash still has original color
5.0,I had to return the first one I ordered as it was a bit too small.  The second one came very quickly and I love it!
5.0,"They fit my thighs perfectly and make them look amazing. I must warn people that they are probably made for people with thinner legs, as they are a snug fit to a 100 lbs 5'2&#34; girl. Just to be clear, when I say snug, I mean there is room for more, but fits just fine as it is."
5.0,Good deal and good quality
5.0,Very nice ties finally got all of my favorite ties at a fraction I would have paid elsewhere
5.0,Absolutely beautiful.  No nickel irritation or allergies.
5.0,"I searched everywhere in stores to try and find mittens on a string before I turned to Amazon and found these. I'm also happy that they are warm and easy to put on my 20 month old daughter. The velcro strap near the cuff makes it easily adjustable so they don't slide off her hands. It is hard to get her thumb in the correct spot, but I'm pretty certain that has nothing to do with the product's quality rather than my stubborn child! I plan on buying another pair in a larger size for next winter!"
5.0,love love these. It is exactly as picture and true to size.
5.0,Looks good in my Shadow Box!!
5.0,I love this product! It's so beautiful and it's been almost a month of having it!! It's sturdy!! Even my cat likes it! Lol
5.0,Lightweight material with excellent seams that hug your hips and flow down to the floor. The Slits in the pant legs are not too high like some in this style. Very comfortable to wear.
5.0,Cute and warm. Love the option of ponytail  or not.
5.0,Nice suit!
5.0,"This dress is super cute!  I got it for a summer wedding and it's floral and nice without being too casual.  The material is nice and fits great.  Not too long (which is great for a short person) and can wear with short heels without having to get it shortened. 5 feet tall, 115 lbs, ordered a small and it fit great."
5.0,Love! Fit is true to size and I like that the straps are adjustable.
5.0,"If a tank was ever made for me, this is it. After having two babies and not being quite as toned in the midsection as I was in my younger years, I am ready to leave the super form-fitting tank tops behind. Enter this shirt. I absolutely love the cut of it. It hits perfectly at my hip (5'8"" 130 lbs and wearing a small) in front and is a bit longer in back to cover my bottom. I love pairing this with denim shorts and jeans. The fabric blend allows for a great weight to the shirt that keeps it from riding up. Not a super lightweight shirt so if you're looking for something to wear it hot, humid climates, this probably isn't it. But I actually love the weight because it causes it to have a great swing to the hem when you move. So flattering! I wash this on cold gentle cycle and line dry to preserve the richness of the black dye. Fit is looser and more flowy. Looks great out or tucked in. Could be easily dressed up with jewelry and heels. Love, love, love it!"
5.0,Too cute and like picture for the love of pits
5.0,I was looking for a good pair of yellow pants and these are just what I expected. high waisted control top and good fabric provide the right amount of support for my cardio and strength activities. The color is very pretty and not see through! Will order more soon.
5.0,Very pleased with this purchase! Smooth snug fit in all the right places.<br />Verry happy. Will be purchasing in other colors.
5.0,I lost the first one purchased for me. Had to buy it again. It was my favorite winter hat.
5.0,Nice felt like quality not cheap feeling
5.0,"It's the perfect size - you just need to find a thin silver chain to put it on, and it goes perfectly with the matching dangle earrings.  Dainty and sparkly.  A fun piece of jewelry that sparks conversations.  The seller shipped it immediately in a pretty gift box and I will definitely shop at Gem Avenue again."
5.0,So comfy & warm!!!!! This jacket is as warm as my winter jacket & it’s so soft even after several washes!  I bought one for my sister in law because she kept trying to steal mine!
5.0,Good quality. Haven't worn off any of the black coating. It gets difficult to get the ball in by hand when you get above 14g in my opinion.
5.0,these are beautiful. they fit really well.
5.0,🥰 love it
5.0,"These aren't going to keep you warm. They are very thin, but that was exactly what we were looking for in these. My children have to wear a covering on the bus these fit the bill perfect. They fit my 8 year old perfect, but they are too big for my 5 year old. I hope this helps others when sizing for their children.😊"
5.0,Very nice band. Great looking.
5.0,Very happy.
5.0,Color and fit were great!  Good value.
5.0,I bought this as a gift but I took a peek at it since I received a discount to make sure it was okay!  This bracelet is well made and fits most size wrists.  It has a nice color and the charms don't look cheap.  This will be a nice addition to anyone's bracelet collection!
5.0,This is 100% better than it expected its gorgeous and fits perfect in am in love with this ring!!!
5.0,Love the masks . More durable than other brands
5.0,Fantastic for a great price
5.0,Good a bit smaller than I expected though oh and goes slower in water
5.0,"I use this to carry things to work. Not too big, not too small and easy to keep clean. The only thing that would make it better is a zippered pocket in the center."
5.0,"This bag is exactly what I was looking for.  It holds my laptop comfortably with all of my other purse stuff.  Mine was delivered without the shoulder strap, but I contacted the vendor and they sent me one out quickly."
5.0,"The dress is very cute and the perfect length! I'm 5'4&#34; and it hits me a bit above the knees. The material is soft, light and the neckline is conservative - which is what I'd like for my tour around Europe, AND has sleeves! It's great. I'm normally an xs, sometimes, xxs, and the fit was great with an xs."
5.0,"I straight up tool this bank over for $1,000,000. Havent gotten caught yet. Keeps you warm and protects your identity."
5.0,My daughter loves her unicorn crocs.
5.0,"These Lapel Pins look really nice right out of the box. I purchased style 2, and the colors are very bright, and the pins look to be good quality. For $12.99 for the set, you can't really go wrong."
5.0,Very pleased with this item. I wore it in my photoshoot😉
5.0,"Love the moon shirt!  I bought a large this time which fits so much better than the medium that I had bought previously.<br />Great stretch and so comfortable and flattering . Wear all the time .<br />Definitely size up, such a great shirt!!"
5.0,"Excellent quality, lenses are very nice on these glasses, polarization works well and soothing to the eyes, however, I did return them, just because I felt they were a bit small for my face. The seller was excellent and the transaction was fast."
5.0,"Very clear lenses. As described, but would have preferred a better choice of color. The spring arms are nice and make the glasses feel like more expensive ones. Comfortable. They do what they're supposed to do.  Great customer service is an added bonus."
5.0,"I was quite skeptical buying this swimsuit for $5 with prime shipping since I know it’s a popular design and frequently inaccurately recreated, but decided for the price to try it out. Well I am so glad I did as it was better than expected! The top is so cute and feminine. When I pulled out the bottoms I got worried thinking there was no way they’d fit a human, but they actually have a decent amount of stretch and feel comfortable. The fabric feels better quality than some other swimsuits I’ve bought for more money on Amazon. It felt somewhat supportive for someone with a tiny figure, but don’t know if you’d feel supported with a fuller figure. Overall, this fit me perfectly and exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend purchasing this swimsuit."
5.0,Buy it! This dress fits perfect. I’m 5”2 123 pds I ordered a small and it hugs every curve. It looks nice and feels good against my skin! Buy it
5.0,I knew this would be a small fit so I bought 2 sizes larger. I have had so many compliments of this outfit it's too cute!
5.0,This fit perfectly!  I think this would have been better with white gloves vs part of the costume but my daughter loved it.  It’s a little difficult to get on and off.  Overall I have a happy child and that’s what mattered.
5.0,"Forget all the bad reviews on this dress.  It fit perfect and the color is awesome.  I bought the purple one and the color is great!  :)  I have large shoulders and a wide back, and a body frame and it fit my body perfect. I was so excited I didnt remove my jeans before I took the picture."
5.0,"Was looking for OEM replacement for new pair of Nike Zoom Vapor 9.5 Tour tennis shoes. Wanted more pop and length than the standard dark navy which was too short at 45&#34;. These are almost 48&#34; which matched the length of my old shoes, same model. The lace shape matches with the original Nike's. Was expecting a flat orange judging by some reviews, but to me, these are a nice medium intensity fluorescent orange. They are actually a bit more saturated than the orange accents of my shoes. Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! 1000% satisfied. Tip: Make sure to measure your old laces for correct length - don't bother with calculations using eyelet count."
5.0,"I picked this out as a present for my wife, and man, did I score.  I was nervous, not knowing much about purses, but it worked out well.  The wife loves it."
5.0,very thin and nice
5.0,Super soft and fit excellent.
5.0,I purchased 5 dresses for my sisters wedding.  They all fit very well and looked amazing.  Great low price and I liked the size range.  It made it easy for us all to order the same dress.  Will post pics after the wedding. ☺
5.0,I'm a size 2 and it fit perfectly! Really cute costume! I got many compliments on it! Washes well too!

5.0,Beautiful bracelet. Very well made and great makesmanship. Comes with a bag to store it that will keep it looking new for a long time.<br />Recommend buy.
5.0,Great price. True to size. I love it.
5.0,"Bought this for my 89 year old mother-in-law and she loved it! The style, color and weight was perfect for her. She lives in Mi and will get a lot of use out of this!"
5.0,"I use this bag to store and tote small balls or other small equipment for PE class.  It is very sturdy and does the job well.  It stays closed when it should and is easy to open, Fast shipping...all is great"
5.0,I just got my sweater and have been waiting for only a couple weeks! It was all I hoped it would be! It has a nice feel to it.. SO HAPPYYY
5.0,Gave to my kids for Christmas.  Super cute.  And they loved them!
5.0,True to size small onions
5.0,I love this sweater.  Great for the office.  Will buy this in different colors. A+++ seller.
5.0,"I am happy with my purchase and love how this dupatta feels luscious, colorful and pretty ghotta work on the borders."
5.0,high quality straps
5.0,"The shirts are nice, but the ones is received seem to run 2 sizes smaller than what the tag says, so they have to be returned."
5.0,"Purchased these for the husband.  He is completely satisfied with everything about them - the fit, the warmth, the durability, and they are a great looking slipper besides.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"I usually wear xl in American sizes and xxl in Chinese sizes, so I ordered an xxl. The xxl is actually a tad bit too big and the sleeves are a little too long, but due to the somewhat unforgiving material, I haven't decided if I'm going to keep the xxl in Black. (Black is always a more forgiving color when it comes to bumps/bulges)<br /><br /> If it were any of the lighter solid colors, I'd definitely recommend ordering a size up,  especially  if you don't have a sleeker body because of the somewhat unforgiving  nature of the material.  If you have a  pudgy belly and/or  few back fat rolls, I recommend ordering a size up in the lighter colors, if you're going to wear it alone. Order your true size if you're going to wear it under something.<br /><br />I plan to order a few more, and when I do, I'm going to order the striped one in my true size and the lighter colors a size up.<br /><br />It DOES have an odd chemical smell that will likely come out by simply hanging it outside for a few hours or washing it, but it wasn't bad enough to make me want to send it back."
5.0,"The watchband was exactly the perfect style, fit, size and color for my new watch! It was a little long, so I used their suggestions to make it shorter and it was simple to do and looks great. It accents my watch perfectly. Love it!"
5.0,Warm and fashionable! I love them!!
5.0,Was perfect! The grand loved it and wears everyday. Very happy customer
5.0,"Buy this skirt!<br />It’s so soft and the material is great!<br />It fit perfectly, I am a size 5 in jeans and ordered a small, it fit in a flattering way.<br />I will be ordering again soo !"
5.0,this tie tack is very beautiful. I would  buy it again. thanks
5.0,I use this for my husband who has Parkinson’s.
5.0,"These bands have been perfect for me. These might not last for decades, but these have worked better than any other cheap alternatives I’ve had. Disclaimer: I don’t get them wet or work out with them, so wouldn’t know how long these would last under other circumstances. Would gladly purchase again."
5.0,"This set is perfect for hot, humid nights. The fabric is light, soft and comfortable. The shorts have an elastic waist and the v neck top has an eye catching pleat. The red is very pretty. The fabric has some stretch and the fit is forgiving."
5.0,This is a great quick release carabiner keychain for my car fob.  Fits well over the straps of my crossbody bag and I never have to search for my fob in my bag.  Attaches and opens easily enough just take a minute to actually look at the mechanism. I like the silver as it is not noticeable on my bag and is very sturdy yet lightweight.
5.0,"I don’t have a face where any pair of glasses look good on me so buying glasses is daunting. Cheaper glasses have a tendency to wear really heavy and uncomfortably, but these can be placed on my face and I’m barely adjusting or removing the glasses to relieve pressure or discomfort. The husband likes them and they look like a second cousin to some Maui Jim glasses I really wanted for a fraction of the price. I’ve had the glasses since September, so not too long.  However the case and the cleaning cloth that came with it is much appreciated. Fingers crossed they last!"
5.0,Fits exactly as expected. The quality is amazing and thick. Not cheap material at all.
5.0,Awesome band. Works great.
5.0,"My son loved it. It does fit slightly small. He is a tall guy, it is never easy to find this type of shirt that fits very well."
5.0,I received my dress today and the dress was a perfect fit. The Dress is very pretty on and this picture doesn’t do it justice. I will order more in the near future! Great investment piece.
5.0,This fanny pack is perfect. Great for doing my nature nerd walks with various tools and I'm expecting it to serve me well on international travel in the coming months. Thanks.
5.0,"We ordered this 6 pair set of Panvbo Socks for my Mother-in-Law who is Diabetic.<br />These are working out great for her so far. She says they are very light and comfortable, not to tight which can be uncomfortable for People with Diabetes or Neuropathy, but just Snug enough to not move around in her Shoes and the triple wide silicone heel grips are keeping them from slipping down.<br />They also wick away perspiration keeping her feet Dry and the Mesh Cotton design is also breathable so her Feet don’t overheat and Sweat to much anyways."
5.0,I LOVE this product!! Great quality that doesn’t cost too much!!!  THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
5.0,preciosa
5.0,LOVE these dresses... I have two.  I have wide shoulders so I went one size up and they fit perfectly.  Material is nice and not too thin.  Very flattering style for someone with a little bit of a belly and wide shoulders.
5.0,Got a few as stoking stuffers. I love their quality and packaging is perfect for gifting.
5.0,I'm generally satisfied<br />1) I bought the orange pink one. If I wanted go back I would have chosen the black one as it is stylish. The orange pink one makes you look fatter<br />2) It's a flowy and gives a non-basic texture and look. On the other hand it is not too flowy. I was considered this would look too complex.<br />3) It was puffy in the pictures but it was not as puffy when arrived. I don't know whether it's a pro or con but that's a difference between pics and the real one.<br />4)The price could be lower.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied but there are aspects which can be improved.
5.0,A very nice purchase and well made item.  My wife uses it whenever she goes to the pool class.  Also keeps your car seat dry.  The inner lining of terry cloth is fantastic.
5.0,I liked how it sparkled in the night . It was the talk of the event . The picture doesn’t do it justice more stunning in person ..I wore a disposable mask underneath for extra protection because I was in a closed environment. I only wished that it came with the pocket inside so you can insert a filter for extra protection but the disposal worked just as fine I only cut the strings off it fit perfectly.
5.0,goes back to my neck or up as a hairband when not needed for a mask
5.0,Excellent product and very good seller exact product information
5.0,Great purchase for pinning
5.0,"I have not worm them yet, but it feels good to<br />the touch. I love the prints and they are perfect<br />for summer. I have tops that will look good<br />With them. I can't wait to wear them. I thought<br />they will be big and loose, just perfect! Yes, a little<br />loose but I like it that way. Perfect for Thailand and South Africa.<br />The price is good also. Let me wear them<br />and I will let you know if they are durable. Thank you for my great purchase, Amazon!😄"
5.0,I really like wearing this braid visor hat on sunny days & when I am having a bad hair day.
5.0,Arrived just as described - great quality! Perfect for my upcoming running relay.
5.0,"I ordered these for my daughters 13th birthday party sleepover.  They are soft, seem durable and will work perfectly for 10 teen girls."
5.0,Love the feel of the fabric
5.0,Looks great and expensive. Loved them
5.0,They are very cool. Love them!
5.0,The quality was nice. Thinner material but not bad at all. I'm 5'2 135 pounds and pear shaped so the size small was perfect for me. Nice and flowy at the shoulders and a little more fitted at the hip. If you want a much looser or flowy fit you can size up and it will still look nice.
5.0,"This is a really cute dress for summer or spring. I ordered it in white and in the sunflower print. I love the waistline of this dress, it’s super flattering on people with curves.  It’s NOT an empire waist which typically falls just under the bust. On me, the waistline falls to my True waist, closer to the bellybutton. This gives your figure a much slimmer appearance while still camouflaging any excess bulge below the belly button. I also love the length, it falls right at my knees while wearing heels. For reference, I am 118lbs 5’5” tall, measurements 34-25-38 and ordered an X-small. The dress runs true to size and possibly a little smaller than other brands. If you have a large chest I would suggest sizing up.<br /><br />I also love the fact that this dress has sleeves and a scoop neckline. It is a modest dress that can be worn for a number of occasions. And the length falling to the knees means no worries about it flying up during windy weather. It can be wore with heels and jewelry for a more dressed up look or worn with sandals for a more casual look. It really is quite versatile. The material is very soft and slightly transparent. The white more so than the sunflower print. However, with nude underwear you can’t see anything. It’s definitely more opaque then other white sundresses I’ve tried. The entire dress does need some ironing straight out of the package but after that the material doesn’t wrinkle easily. Perfect dress for summer or spring !"
5.0,This shirt is great and comfortable for layering when golfing. Light weight and true to size fit!
5.0,genius invention.  watch out for flying stays
5.0,"Perfect for carring mesa, bought one for me, one for gift"

5.0,"They fit perfectly and arent way too big or small, 10/10 much better then the drugstore kind."
5.0,yes these gloves are fitting very well.
5.0,"I'm very pleased with the quality of this shirt 65/35 poly cotton blend makes it easy to care for in the washer and dryer.  I hate to iron and can get away with not ironing this shirt.  I love the built-in stays in the collar.  I thought those only came in men's shirts.  It makes this shirt very professional looking.  There are two buttons on the sleeves to adjust the tightness.  I'm curious about the button holes on both sides of the shirt, but not concerned as they are not seen when buttoned.  I would definitely recommend this shirt."
5.0,"I don't want to take them off. I just hope they wash and hold up well. If they do, I will probably buy another set. Love how they feel."
5.0,I’m satisfied with the products<br />I’m a healthcare worker.
5.0,My nephew is a big Luigi fan and he loves his hat 👍🏻

5.0,Will only order from this company Great Price and they are excellent quality.

5.0,Very expensive looking!
5.0,Took on a trip to Florida. Held everything I needed on the plane with no worries about anything falling out since all the pockets have a zipper. The wristlet was great to take at night! The craftmanship is worth twice the price.
5.0,"This was a gift for my 6 year old. I thought it was going to be bigger but it looks appropriately sized for a 6 year old. It fits three pairs of dance shoes, tights, dance shorts, 2 leotards, and a hair prep bag with room to spare."
5.0,Gave as gift!
5.0,"I am 120lbs, 5’7. I ordered a small in color white. Fits to size. high waisted. Exactly what I was looking for. The material is great. Not stretchy, Usually I find that cheaper denim is TOO stretchy, this is just perfect."

5.0,Comfortable and lightweight! Perfect for cold weather sports without the extra weight or bulk when you don’t need it. The 3 pack is great for sharing or being able to rely on another hat while the others are waiting to be washed.
5.0,"These are the cutest little things. I saw them and I knew I wanted them immediately. Emoji's are very much the in thing right now and I see them all over the place on pillows and drawings and pictures etc. I couldn't not have it as my little keychain once I saw it. I had a hard time choosing between the two different steps, and we decided to get the ones of the different colors In order to be able to tell our keys apart easier.  I also happen to have two kids so it was nice to have a set of four so that I could give each of them one as a toy.  They look exactly as pictured so I did not take another picture to post in this review as I did not think that it would add any value. The keychain attachment is very nice and make sucking it onto your keys very easy and effortless.  The plush part itself seems to be high-quality and I think that it will hold up to wear and tear of being a keychain. I think I can even hand wash these and dry them if they get dirty. I would recommend this product. Disclaimer, I did purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My opinions in this review were in no way affected by the fact that this was a promotional transaction."
5.0,These pants felt so soft and cute but unfortunately I was sent the wrong size. Customer service was amazing!!!
5.0,I order three bags of these sick and it was a good fit on everyone. I bought them to give out for my sons 4 th birthday and there are so cute and everyone was fighting for them lol.
5.0,"Three pairs of sturdy studs for under $20 can't be beat. Beautiful silver and shiny, bright stones...I wear next to more expensive and real jewelry without hesitation."
5.0,Package came fast and also there was a card for a free set.  How awesome is that?
5.0,"These are really high quality. Each came in their own soft draw string bag, and cleaning rag! Will be purchasing more for the unbeatable price"
5.0,This was a gift & my friend loved it! Nice quality shirt!
5.0,Absolutely stunning gift idea
5.0,"Really like the texture and organic feel to this jewelry line and this heart pendant was no exception. The detailing of the two textures is beautiful and the weight of the pendant is not too heavy, but the weight of the pendant definitely feels like a designer piece of jewelry. Personally the chain was not long enough for me (they rarely are), so I swapped the chain for a longer one and it looks fantastic on a shorter necklace or a longer one. I like the double bale and feel the craftsman ship of the entire piece is of good quality. The only thing I wish is that they offered an option for the chain in a 20&#34; length with a 2&#34; extender for those of us that like a necklace longer than 18&#34;. If you haven't tried this Israeli jewelry line, this is a nice place to start and would be a great gift!"
5.0,Loved this!!
5.0,"Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I normally wear a M/L but after reading the reviews I decided to get an XL. I'm glad I did as it fit me very well, was just lose enough to be comfortable but definitely not to lose. I love the lightweight fabric and the colors were perfect. I would recommend ordering a size up. No problems with the product or seller!"
5.0,I ordered the workout top to compliment other shirts that I have bought.  The color is very pretty and it fits me perfectly.
5.0,Love this nightgown.  A little spandex helps it keep its shape.  It is a nice length above the knee but not so short that I feel like I cannot sit comfortably in it.
5.0,I love the dress! Form fitting and very retro. I originally ordered a size 8 however I had to return it. I bought a size 10 instead. It's a lovely drsss. I would definitely buy it in another color.
5.0,PERFECT COLOR WEIGHT AND SIZE😊
5.0,"I LOVE THIS DRESS!! I am 5’6 and 205 lbs, DD chest and wide hips. The dress is very long on me, but perfect with hells. Super cute and so easy. I am in love!!"
5.0,Great value for all the chokers. Holds up well so far and fits my neck.
5.0,I love my reusable bag! I would definitely recommend it.<br />I also would love to have different sizes
5.0,I bought this for my mom for mother's day as a part of a package sent to her with other things. She pretty much wears it every few days now and it hasn't given her trouble.
5.0,Súper cómodo y la talla se corresponde
5.0,"Oh, I love this pick necklace.  It looks so nice on a white shirt and is a true pink."
5.0,My boyfriend loved this!
5.0,It was so cute everyone loved it

5.0,Long for my height (5'2) but fit perfect everywhere else.
5.0,I use it everyday when doing the house chores. It works well and keeps my hair in place. The color is also pretty. I shared some with my bestie and she also loved it.
5.0,The dress fits great and its very flattering on. The only thing that went wrong was it didnt come in time it was late arriving.
5.0,Loved this beanie cap. It was a perfect fit. It is one of my favorite accessories.
5.0,"I loved my first pair of these from a local store so much that I searched out a second pair. This pair is just slightly smaller, a little harder to zip all the way, but not uncomfortable to wear. I expect they will loosen a little more with some wear. So comfortable with good support and an arch that keeps me from overpronating. I wore my first pair after Achilles surgery and they were approved by my podiatrist. Highly recommend."
5.0,"Wore one to st Maarten and have been wearing in the shower every day, rarely take it off and there’s little to no wearing on the metal. Very satisfied and I love the variety! Can’t wait to try them out w my bathing suits =^_^="
5.0,Muy bonitos Me gustó muchísimo
5.0,I like the pants because they fit just right and are very comfortable.
5.0,"Awesome shirt, good quality, wish they had more authors as well as Mr Bukowski I'd mos defiantly purchase from this company again."
5.0,LOVE IT! So comfortable I wanted more but when I went on-line it said not available.
5.0,"Muy buena compra , diseño diferente y calidad para el precio. Es para ejercitarse, buena elasticidad. Color femenino y delicado"
5.0,"Nice, comfortable and stylish"
5.0,"This dress is beautiful! I bought a similar polka dot dress a few months ago and I loved it so much I wanted another one. The fit of the dress is very flattering and I appreciate the modest neckline. It fits to my body but has some stretch to the material (65% cotton/35% spandex). For reference, I am 5'3&#34; and it hits a little below my knees. It seems to be well made. I haven't washed it yet but the tag says to hand wash cold, lay flat to dry, medium iron as needed.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to wearing the dress for weddings and other events. I recommend getting a petticoat to go with it. I bought this one [[ASIN:B0158B0Z14 Vianla Women's 50s Vintage Rockabilly Petticoat,26&#34; Length Net Underskirt Black XL]]. It helps give it a 50's flair!<br /><br />**Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion. The comments in this review are my own and are not influenced by the discount."
5.0,"Beautiful dress!  Fit my wife perfectly.  Size 8 is a true medium.  It comes very wrinkled, however, so be prepared to spend a few buck getting it steamed."
5.0,Very cute and fit my 1 year old well
5.0,Comfortable and stylish. Lenses are very char.
5.0,She loves it!
5.0,Received this as a Christmas gift.  The picture does not do it justice!  The embroidery work is great and is in my opinion a sharp looking cap.  There is a tag sown on the inside that states it is an official licensed product of the U.S. Air Force.  A possible downside - Made in China.  Hopefully we'll start seeing more Made in America again!
5.0,Love them!Just the sticker they put on the lens does not come off easy! Would be better with no sticker on it! Ruins the lens
5.0,"My son recently converted his religion and I bought this to support his change.  He loves it and wears it proudly.  He likes the fact that it's not ""dainty"", but suits a man."
5.0,Perfect. Stretchy material
5.0,Shirt fits well and has been washed a few times now.  No color loss and no shrinkage.  I get many compliments on this shirt.  Its a good buy for the money too.
5.0,"Best tank tops ever! I first bought these at CostCo and have worn out the two I purchased. Awesome fit, very flattering and so comfortable for workouts. On my way to getting every color available. :-)"
5.0,Fits as expected. Warm and comfy.
5.0,I bought this for my best friend for Christmas. She loves turtles. She absolutely loved it!!! I will definitely purchase more from this company in the future.
5.0,They're great!
5.0,"I actually love this tank. The cut was a little odd looking, but when I put it on it fit perfect and was super cute! I like the material too. Great every day tank to wear around!"
5.0,Bought it for a friend
5.0,Beautiful necklace!
5.0,"Love this outfit, very comfortable and not a cheap material, great airport outfit , shorts was a tad big on me but the shirt fit perfect plus I don’t like my shorts tight  so it’s great"
5.0,Great for morning runs
5.0,Love this super cute bracelet.  Betsey has the best stuff.
5.0,Best shoes for you crawler to walker! If they fit a little big just pop on some socks. I bought all sizes for my little girl. Material is great and you can pair these shoes with a variety of outfits
5.0,Love these boots! Going to buy another pair!
5.0,"Definitely not the real thing, but my nephew loved the product anyway. Because it isn’t real gold, he has kept up with the cleaning and taking care of it..Otherwise, It’s holding him over until the real thing."
5.0,Looks like photo.
5.0,"Excellent quality and value for the price., My daughter who is a Psych fan loved it!"
5.0,"Ordered this for my boyfriend and it fits him just as expected. He loves that it's a snapback so he can adjust if needed and says it's super comfortable. The white material on top can be a bit thicker/better quality, but I'm not complaining. He also likes that it actually says &#34;CAPTAIN&#34; in the front. Great for pool parties, boat trips, raves, Halloween costumes, etc."
5.0,"Pretty much looks like the picture, but it’s really thin material.  I love the sleeves.  I’m going to order another"
5.0,This is so beautiful I order the large 12month
5.0,Love them all!! My favorite!!
5.0,"I am pleases with the the quality of the fabric, it is a nice thick cotton. My son wears US size 2T. I ordered this in a size 3T and fits him well with a little room to grow."
5.0,For stitched together fabric pretty close to woodland digital. It fits around my whole head very well. I highly recommend this for paintball/airsoft.
5.0,Son loves them....he'd sleep in them if I'd let him.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:322666444e5c4304c51981050d291365]] Ok for only 10$ amazing petticoat! Good quality and really fluffy! Would recommend!
5.0,Was so happy to get this. It's everything and more. And the best part. It was shipped from the town I use to live in when I was in California. It was meant to be the right thing for me. And at the moment I knew.
5.0,Awesome jewelry and fits great
5.0,better for 5 years old and up. they were big on my 3 years old. they fit my 5 years old like a glove :D
5.0,"These look GREAT on stage! Super happy. I'm the lead singer in an Eagles tribute band (Eaglemania), and I love the shirts."
5.0,This bag is exactly what I expected and it is great to keep in my briefcase.
5.0,BEAUTIFUL!!!!
5.0,Perfect hat. Has adjustable strap in the back to fit anybody’s head. Love the colors in the material.
5.0,They held up well to all the play.  The graphics were fun.  Good quality.
5.0,I absolutely love this dress. I am 5’5 165 pounds and the size large is perfect and very comfortable and flattering. Some of the reviews said when they washed the dress on cold the colors blead. So I will be taking this dress to the cleaners and will post a update.
5.0,Got one for me and my boyfriend and they came with cute little white gift boxes and the right size. The money was definitely was worth it for them we love them. I had these for a month while I don't have any scratches on mine he does from always working so I'll keep that in mind if you do a lot of hands on activities.
5.0,Love the quality and the fit- they look so pretty even if they might peek out of some style of shoes- the lace makes me feel pretty.
5.0,May need a smaller size. Jean has alot of stretch. I'm normally wear medium & I exchange for small. Plan to buy in white & black
5.0,"This thing is huge but I love it. Could wear it as a dress, I’m a size size 18-20 in women’s and six feet tall"
5.0,"I bought the first pair of these for my kid when he was 3 and starting an outdoor playgroup. I bought them a size or two big and cuffed them hem. They stretched a tiny bit after machine washing on delicate-cold, but after a few washings the knit actually tightened up a little. He’s now 5 and tall and can still wear them as knickers with tall wool socks under rain pants or as is. These are so warm and versatile I just bought another oversized pair here. I hope he can wear them for another few years!"
5.0,My granddaughter loved this & it looks so cute on
5.0,"These are awesome, look great and I always get so many compliments on them."
5.0,Liked the way it fits.
5.0,"Follow the size chart. I am 5'4 , 165lbs. I am short and petite. Measurements are  bust: 36, waist 30.5 and hips 40 - 41in. ordered a M and  I definitely  should  have went for the L or maybe even XL lol. Baby everything was tight (I tried it on w/o a bra) dont think I could  have gotten one on if I tried that how tight it was in the bust. I sent it back! However material was good and it was as expected I should have just ordered the right size !!!  I gave the product a 5 star b/c  the fitting error was my fault."
5.0,"I ordered the last one in stock. Got many compliments on this dress; It fot perfect for my shape. Dress fell just under my knees, I’m 5’ 3”"
5.0,"I love this sweater so much, I own 3 colors, and bought my mom one for Christmas. It’s my go to jacket daily. The only thing I wish were different was that they made an XS, or the jackets in general a little smaller. These jackets are so cozy, though, I don’t mind enough to part with them! I am a small, and the arms and chest are a little big. Same thing with my mom’s- she is normally an XL, but a M fits her perfectly. So, if you are looking for something fitted, go two sizes down if possible!"
5.0,"A very nice quality Renaissance chemise, it didn’t work for my costume but I would buy from this company again !"
5.0,"I bought this to wear out in the yard, or on the days I didn't feel like doing anything with my hair, and it's been great!"
5.0,I bought this product for my son for xmas. Great size and quality!
5.0,"This is a quality hat with an all stitched logo and a flat brim, which was important to my son."
5.0,"Amazing!!!  I normally wear 34A.  This looks just like in the picture, and creates cleavage where there is none.  Love it!"
5.0,Excellent quality. Very classy. You can wear it with jeans or skirts - versatile.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:44c394e9e4c3926de256d362084db6c1]] This dress is just really pretty!
5.0,Fits great!!! Material is of a good quality. I love it.
5.0,I was surprised when it fit so well.  I used the size chart.  Sewn well.  Not too heavy or too light. Did not fade when washed.  Read label for care and dry flat.  Get compliments on it
5.0,"Bought these as a gift for my husband! He loves them super soft, great material, super comfy!"
5.0,"Whisper soft, comfortable, but I regret ordering a medium rather than a small.  Based upon other reviews I erred to the larger size - but a snugger fit might have lent a hint of support and kept straps in place a bit better.  Not a deal breaker though - so very comfortable!  The arm holes are generous and the neck line scoops low enough to allow some pretty feminine styles and still not show.  No obvious shrinkage in the wash."
5.0,Warm and well made.  My husband loves these!
5.0,Great cuff watch just what I was looking for wear it all the time easy to get on and off dont have to worry about bands breaking
5.0,I love these pins I have them on several jackets
5.0,Fit awesome
5.0,"We all need this. In the winter we stretch them, in the summer we shrink them. this thing is amazing. the guy who made this is a craftsman. He did some job. Sturdy, easy to use, nicely finished and even comes with an extension in case your stretched beyond the norm. A good handy product to have. Now, if I have to stretch them a lot, I use a pair of vice grips to hold the pants together where they button so as not to pop the button. Just flap over a small piece of old towel, clamp the vice grip and stretch away. Works phenomenal."
5.0,"Great variety, fun and unique"
5.0,"Quality mask, perfect fit and looks good!"
5.0,"Well build for the price. I Have two of this backpacks for my work and personal 15"" laptop perfectly fits. Lots of pockets for pens and both side holds my coffee cup traveler and water bottle! I love it. I can't ask for more."
5.0,"This product was super awesome! Comfortable, and super cute. I got so many compliments at work! Also the packaging was adorable. 10/10 recommend. I have long hair and was able to put it in a low pony tail and get all of my hair under the scrub cap."
5.0,"It's easily adjustable, comfortable, and holds my accessories securely."
5.0,I ordered a medium and it fit me perfectly and it is now my favorite hoodie. I get stopped at places when a fellow Flash fan sees my hoodie and compliments it.
5.0,I love this blouse and receive compliments every time I wear it.
5.0,Fast ship comfortable to wonderful price
5.0,"Warm, well made and seem to be wearing well.  Just don't dry them in your clothes dryer.  They do tend to shrink just a little after a few dryings.  I would buy them again."
5.0,Great quality! Much better than I expected. Will definitely order from this seller again!
5.0,"I have always used this type of sunglasses over my glasses... so easy to flip up when entering a store or completing a transaction. Easy to remove and put back on also, and super easy to store in pocket or purse!"
5.0,"I have prescription glasses that I cannot see ANYTHING without, and even though they are tinted transition lenses, the sun and glare is still a real problem for me. Worst of all, when I wear a regular cap or visor, my bangs get sweaty and bunch up to make me look like a real goober! This visor slips onto the arms of my glasses and sits perfectly between the upper rim of my glasses and my bangs, so ... I'm no longer a goober!<br />I highly recommend this visor."
5.0,I bought this bracelet for my son. He loves the look and quality of this African turquoise bracelet. It’s large enough for a mans wrist.
5.0,Lightweight look good
5.0,are very nice for the price
5.0,Nice shirt runs really small.
5.0,Loved the fit and fabric. Very comfortable!
5.0,These are actually great quality and sizing is true.
5.0,Super cute!! Medium fits comfortable. It is see through. So be careful what you wear under it!
5.0,Beautifull!!! Perfect!
5.0,"fits great, beautiful color"
5.0,"el material es bueno, pero atras me queda muy bajito."
5.0,2mm
5.0,"These are pleasantly tight, keep you in place."
5.0,"I'm not gonna lie, I bought this to match a romper I got my baby on Shein. Honestly this is the best purchase of my life. I can't WAIT until she's big enough to fit in hers so we can match.<br />The fit is good. The fabric is soft with descent stretch. I'd say it fits comparably with 2x cotton rompers I've bought on Shein. It's short, but not too short. Very comfy.<br /><br />For reference:<br />I'm 5'9<br />Size 16 pants<br />Size 36J bra"
5.0,"These earrings are so cute and fun but I was pleasantly surprised that for fairly cheap costume-style earrings, they were of fairly sturdy quality and looked great on."
5.0,These work amazing well and stay in for hours. Even the adults loved them!
5.0,"This is a nice looking floral summer dress. Before ordering I was a little concerned if the colors would look different in-person but no, they look the same as in the product images. The dress weighs around 357g but it does not feel heavy. It is soft and stretchy, and the material looks very good. Look at some of the pictures I uploaded, the Medium size reaches slightly below the knee on a 5’4” tall person.<br /><br />I love the pockets, they help avoid holding the phone or keys in my hands, Happy with the fit, very comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Hope this review was helpful."
5.0,Love these pants.  Holds my cell phone while I exercise at the gym or just taking a walk. Fit is perfect.
5.0,Adorable! My granddaughter will love it!
5.0,a favorite tshirt
5.0,Gorgeous coat. Not for winter. Looks super classy on. Compliments the figure
5.0,"This Spiga chain necklace was delivered on time and arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />This chain by U7 is such a great chain.  I got this for my teenage son who has been wanting one for a while.<br /><br />The chain I chose is the stainless steel and it looks great.  It looks way more expensive than what I paid for it.  This chain is a little bit thicker than a normal chain, but it works perfectly for men.  It is sturdy and I have no worries that he will break it.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this chain.  My son likes it and the stainless steel makes it super durable.<br /><br />**I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review**"
5.0,I really like this top because it is shaped around the waist instead of full like the others I bought.  Highly satisfied!
5.0,For the price it's very nice my son loves it.  Go shark week!
5.0,My son has autism and for his ABA classes this summer these have helped so much!<br />We live where summers are so hot so I thought he would not wear a vest so the tanks are great! He focuses for longer periods and doesn’t complain about them! We love these and will be getting more!
5.0,"Gave this as a gift. They loved it. Great hoodie, vibrant colors, always gets compliments. It's more on the thinner side; so, I probably wouldn't wear it in really cold weather."
5.0,l loved the price and quality. TY
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments on it and it’s so comfortable
5.0,Overall nice set of sunglasses...
5.0,Love that it can be a baseball cap and face shield for virus or sun. Very well made!
5.0,Quality was better than I was expecting.  I  had ordered the wrong size case and they were able to correct my order without any problems
5.0,"I really like this keychain. It is very nice. Looks great, packaged nicely. Love the sentiment and arrived early. Would order from this company again."
5.0,These haven't been worn often but they are great for $13. They didn't turn my ears green and they look nice. I have long hair so earrings are not really something I wear often.
5.0,Beautiful! Just as shown :)
5.0,The length of this skirt is exactly what I was looking for. It hits below the knee and the pleats just makes the skirt look so sophisticated. I got many compliments when I wore this with a black long sleeve body suit on Mother’s Day.
5.0,Nicer. Than expected.
5.0,this was a gift. It is very bright and cheerful.  well worth the money for a bracelet or even if you wanted to use the beeds for another project. My niece really likes it alot!
5.0,"I got this dress and loved it. True to size. It was my birthday spent at the beach. I cannot say more"" The material is truly soft and nice. It do not feel like polyster""<br />Its prettier in person."
5.0,"Really liked this classic oversized black sweater. Material seems really good, the seater is warm. Wore it to work an got several compliments. Good for fall season. Happy with my new sweater"
5.0,"This is honestly one of the best things I have ever purchased off Amazon! The look of the hat is like a much pricier item....it goes with everything, stays clean.....super super cute.  I have a big head and it fit me perfect :)"
5.0,4th of July was a hit with this. Thanks.
5.0,"Great crinoline petticoat for the price! I am 5'2 and it is the right length on me to go under retro dresses and skirts. The lining is comfortable and it is not as scratchy as some petticoats I have worn, it gives a lovely poof without being too over the top. It does not add bulk to the waist or upper hips and flares at the hem, for the most flattering Silhouette. The sheen to the fabric is very cute and I don't mind if it peeks out under my skirt.<br />I would definitely recommend this petticoat to anyone looking for some fullness and a retro silhouette!"
5.0,After 1 wash it fit perfect and looks great.  I will be ordering more but in another color to mix it up.
5.0,"I love, love  these.  I have a 27&#34; ribcage & 40&#34; bust & have been searching all over for a new sleep bra.  I bought the long line small/large & they are great.  I was disappointed when I first got them & put one on.  It was not at all supportive & was not going to work for me.  I put another on over the first & it was perfect!  Just the right amount of compression & support & only a little quadding.  I don't use the pads, so I can't say how they work.  The wide band is soooo comfortable & I have not had any problems with it rolling until I wear them a couple nights.  Once they start, I know it's time to get out a new pair.  I would not personally exercise in these or wear them out of the house, but they are super comfortable for sleeping & lounging around in.  I bought another pack after the first & hope they never stop selling these."
5.0,"Adult size, not for kids"
5.0,"These are awesome, love the grip on the bottom, very warm and thick. Must have!"
5.0,gave as a gift....the recipient absolutely loved it
5.0,"Snoga is the BEST, hands down. Love all my snoga skirts!"
5.0,I am so in love with everything about this dress. The light blue color I got is so pretty. Looks great on!!
5.0,Super classy and well made for a very inexpensive price.
5.0,Good quality material and printing
5.0,The scarf is cute and not too bulky and the material is very soft.  Looks great with a black fitted dress or even a fitted black long sleeve with jeans!
5.0,"Nice shirt, just afraid it might shrink too much."
5.0,Awesome!!!! I like it and have received many compliments thank you!!
5.0,Use it every day..Great for travel too.
5.0,"True to size 5’7, 230lbs , ordered a 2xl"
5.0,Watch band it’s a great product the product matches description and listing product is comfortable wearing for all sorts of activities such as working out working at a job relaxing at home recommend this product to any person or consumer that has a smart watch
5.0,"Perfect for the use case - needed for part of a cosplay.  Slim fit, exactly as described.  I would order up a size if I intended to wear this as a regular shirt, but for cosplay I ordered my normal size and expected it to fit closely (it does)."
5.0,This is the perfect beach wrap!
5.0,"My grandson loves this item.  His money is kept in tact, and his keys are available without being lost.  The fabric is washable, and it is a good asset to his Boys Scout training.  It reminds me of being in the military again.  I, too, ordered one for myself."
5.0,Got it for my grand daughter
5.0,My wife say's the dress is all she hoped it would be. Very pleased. Thank You Jesse
5.0,"I purchased the 14mm gold covered sterling silver earrings based on positive reviews, though I was somewhat hesitant. The website claimed these earrings were hypoallergenic, nickel-free, etc., so I took a chance. I've worn them to test the claim and haven't had any irritation so far. The metal is a smooth, shiny surface and would be perfect with casual or formal wear. I did not have any problems with replacing the tiny backing with a more supportive, larger comfort one which some mentioned. And, I really appreciated the longer post. My only wish would be a slightly larger size. At 14mm (about 1/2 inch), these are still lady-like, but I would have purchased them at 16mm for a bit more drama (those with stretched lobes might also like a larger size)."
5.0,So pretty and fit just as expected !
5.0,Love everything about this dress! I normally wear size 8 & I ordered a large & it fits great!
5.0,Super cute and fits awesome for the price!!!!!!!!
5.0,"I love this jumper! First I bought a size L and it did fit me but was too fitted for my liking and the leg openings were too tight on my calves. For size reference, I'm 5'8&#34;, 140-150 lbs and normally a size M in women's, size L in junior's. I wanted it to fit over-sized so I returned it for a XXL. It is perfect! I love it! Lightweight, soft and comfy. I recommend ordering up a size or two if you don't want it fitted. So cute!"
5.0,"These shirts are better than expected. Definitely ordering more. I'm 5'11"" 180lbs I ordered a L which is Medium in US and it's a perfect fit."
5.0,Fits good and looks good.
5.0,Very special watch band! Like a pearl bracelet! I chose Size L and it fits my wrist!
5.0,Can't believe you can get a good watch for this price.  A new watch battery costs almost this much.
5.0,I am so in love with this dress and it stretches!!!!! So comfy for all day!
5.0,After just a month and a half a gross film developed in between the lenses. For $25 I expected at least a bit better!<br /><br />*UPDATE: Reached out to Knockaround on their website and they're sending me a new pair for free. Updating this rating for excellent customer service and acknowledgement that my pair was defective!*
5.0,"material, color, size and price are perfect, you can coordinate it with almost all colors of clothes"
5.0,Looks great and is one piece you need to own 😜 quality feels great does not fade at least not yet from months I've owned it. I actually lost one and had to purchase a new one
5.0,"This is a terrific Halloween tee shirt. The graphic is cute and the shirt is extremely soft and comfortable. The shirt comes in four different colors, all have the same design on them, and it fits to size. There is a sizing chart along the side so it’s a good idea just to double check there before you buy one, just in case.<br /><br />The manufacturer makes some lofty claims about this shirt. It claims that the printed pattern is elastic and bright in color (that’s not the lofty claim, it’s coming…) and that it will not fade, fall off and/or crack after washing. I thought this was going to be one of those things that was simply said but after three washes the shirt looks exactly like it did. The pattern on the front looks exactly the same. So far, all the claims made seem to be true.<br /><br />I really like this shirt. It’s absolutely adorable and a definite Halloween shirt! It’s just so cute! I would easily recommend this if anyone were to ask me about it."
5.0,Love the different colors. Performs just as good if not better than the original. Even if it doesn’t last you get three of them.
5.0,I love this dress. Super soft material and a great fit. Fits as expected.
5.0,I just experienced possibly the very best customer service of all time. A couple days ago I experience some pricing error I messaged NINAQUEEN they went beyond my expectations and their charms OMG!!! SO well made even better than Pandoras who charges for some of them $$$ for their charms + not all that cute.<br />NINAQUEEN charms theirs so beautiful so well made with 1/2 the price.<br />I was so impressed! What a remarkable company and items. They have a customer for life.
5.0,Fit right on target and they doe not slip or crawl up
5.0,Did what it was meant to with no issues!
5.0,It's pretty comfortable 👌.
5.0,"My friend gave me 2 Kate and Macy bracelets that didn't fit her.  I loved them  I had never been much or wearing bracelets, but I just can't get enough of Kate and Macy!  They fit so nice, are made so well, and the beads go with so many colors.  Kudos to you!"
5.0,Looks gorgeous on....ordering it in more colors asap
5.0,"Vibrant, beautiful case.  I love the design, and it has already withstood a couple of dramatic falls with no damage to my phone. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,"good product and good service delivered on time and new as advertised, would purchase again if needed."
5.0,Loved this set!!!
5.0,Love it so much I bought it in another color
5.0,"This is a great basic shirt to grab and go. It looks good, hides a world of imperfections and is easy to wear. It's loose fitting so if you want ""the look"" you'll need to go with your regular size. If you want it more close fitting size down. That being said, I wear a medium and I got a medium and I'm happy. The high low hem covers a multitude of sins and it's lightweight without feeling flimsy. Oh, did I mention it looks good too?"
5.0,This product looks and feels like a legit NFL jersey I love it.. Shane Falco is my favorite Movie football player.
5.0,I initially purchased a Medium sized shirt (which is my usual size). But that was too big on me and had to return.<br /><br />I re-ordered a Small size and it fits me perfectly as I would want.<br /><br />The fabric is light and soft on skin. I wore it with a black leggin and love it.<br /><br />Will certainly try other patterns of this tops.
5.0,I wear a Medium t-shirt size . so i ordered once size up for this jersey.<br />Fits perfect and is comfortable. Use it regularly and atleast on 2 long rides (40+ miles).<br />Perfect jersey . Can't beat the prize.<br /><br />Update After 11 months and 25+ rides : the jersey is still going strong and is as good as new.
5.0,"Love these, comfortable and fit well."
5.0,I liked everything about it and most of al it made me laugh because I would think of the show and its characters!!!!
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for. Minor complaint is if your someone who puts on your belt whilst wearing your pants, the belt needs to be threaded from the left side if you want the logo right side up. I maybe weird but I thread by belt from the right side so the Logos are upside down. Otherwise great quality belt that is an excellent value with the right amount of stretch and secure fastener"
5.0,Slimming fit! Love it
5.0,"My daughter loves it, it fits perfect and the fabric is very nice!"
5.0,my bridesmaids looked wonderful in this set
5.0,Best diaper bag my son has had.  It’s perfect!!
5.0,Good quality product as described.  Not too short and too small.  exactly what I need.
5.0,"Beautiful amethyst earrings.  They are just the right size.  Not too much, but a tad more than a stud.  Definitely worth the price."
5.0,"Everything came in tact, they even sent it with a super sweet note and a matching ring. The packaging was pretty, the bubble rap was pink hearts!"
5.0,Very  small but nice.
5.0,Loved it! Great statement piece!
5.0,"Comfy, Saturday and super cute!"
5.0,Super cute and well craft!<br />Great gift !!!!!!
5.0,Perfect fit. Not too loose. Does shrink sime when washed.
5.0,My daughter loved this wig and used it in a Ciel Cosplay for Comic Con. Fit as expected and looked cute!
5.0,"I got the Red and it's cute, cheaply made, Very thin but that was to be expected because of the price for that I'm still giving 5 stars 😍"
5.0,"Durable, Comfortable and Feminine..."
5.0,Great robe. Somewhat large. Comfortable!! Can only be worn in cold environment. Family and friends like it because of the hood.
5.0,The dress was very well made - nice material. I recently wore it to a conference and got many compliments on it!<br />Very stylish and professional!
5.0,My teenage niece loved this
5.0,Love it!  Exactly what I was I looking for..
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress!!! If you are a curvy heavier-set girl like me, this dress is going to be SOOO flattering on you and I completely recommend it!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Super nice quality fabric (not really as &#34;soft&#34; as I expected but super strong and nice and will last a long time).<br />-really well fitting, stretchy back is fantastic!<br />-extremely flattering.<br />-looks nice with or without a petticoat.<br />-Pattern is bright and vibrant.<br />-Waist ribbon is removable if you'd like to use a different color or type.<br />-really quite comfortable!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-this is less of a con and more of just something to note, their size chart is kind of off. Their measurements for an extra large are in the mid 30&#34; or something for waist but I'm somewhere in the low 40s and it's slightly big on me. Just keep that in mind when ordering.<br />-the only other thing I can think of is that the halter top tie is a kind of thick fabric so when you tie it it's a little hard to get just right so it sits comfortably on your neck. It's not ba at all though ^-^<br /><br />Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this to a friend. In fact, I'm probably gonna buy one or two more! Also note, I added a photo of me without my petticoat too so that you can see how it falls."
5.0,It's very nice!
5.0,its so pretty! on my daughter. love it. satin texture deliver on time.
5.0,"Very soft and warm. Be careful when choosing the size and pay attention to the attached table. A variety of colors, I took it in Light Grey and it is beautiful. For the price it has and being that it is going to be used for day to day it is perfect."
5.0,Hubby remembers this from when he was a kid and was very happy when I surprised him with this vintage  style t-shirt.
5.0,I got the XS purple laces for my toddler’s size 7 shoes and it fit perfectly. I don’t like the silicone no-tie shoelaces that seem to be popular right now. These are exactly what I was looking for and make putting shoes on and taking them off very easy.
5.0,"I love this necklace!  I've accidentally worn it in the shower and have slept with it on and it has been fine.  It's just my style; it's fun, not too fancy, you can read the words that are engraved easily, and it's a decent length. I love the added touch of the little paw charm, and that it's sterling silver."
5.0,"Love, love, love this dress."
5.0,"I am 4'11 and weigh around 110and wear a 32 D in bras. I ordered the pink  US size 6-8 swimsuit and the top fit just perfectly because it has adjustable straps like a normal bra would. The top is also padded and has an underwire, so essentially it has some bra components that work well to keep your chest supported. The only problem that I had was that the bottoms were a bit big even if I tied them tighter. Overall I am a happy customer that had slightly baggie bottoms that I tied tighter."
5.0,"Cheapy glasses, but sturdy and do the work!  So can’t complain."
5.0,"Really happy with these, arrived on time, and in perfect condition. Very comfortable."
5.0,"Everything about this product was amazing. I have had these shoes for two months now, and you can walk all day in them. They are so comfortable."
5.0,"I highly recommend due to price , quality , color , seeing is believing!!"
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. Color is exact as the picture. Shape very well done! I love the brand!
5.0,Bought this for the pandemic for my 3 year old son. Its a little big but he loves it and won't take it off. Looks like its double layered so it warm and breathable perfect for winter or a global pandemic
5.0,"Fit great, had a small tear in the tull tho."
5.0,"They are a great fit, comfortable relaxing."
5.0,"Easy to order, fast delivery. Beautiful dress that you can wear over leggings or by itself. Lots of embroidery details and summery soft and light. Love it!"
5.0,This is a nice large bag and enjoy the waxed canvas material. I bought  this as a gift and they loved it. I wanted to keep it for myself so I will probably purchase another one
5.0,"I bought this to replace a chain that I had been wearing for a couple of years that sudden broke.  The chain was actually nicer than I had anticipated, based on the price.  Excellent quality, strong, holds up well, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5.0,Loved this purse. Can't wait to use it.
5.0,Classy and amazing Style and color
5.0,I love this bag.  It's light and durable.  Unfortunately I had an issue with the zipper however the vendor promptly replaced the bag.  I was so grateful since I loved the bag so much.  Great customer service!
5.0,Very well made and even cuter in person.  :)
5.0,It's very cute and elegant. I wish they also produce the same style of dress with additional squared neck and long flared sleeves. It would makes me look like a princess. This dress is perfect for wine tasting!
5.0,"Great little dress for the price.  Soft Jersey and nice drape, i turned a lot of heads in the blue. I got a small and I'm 5ft2 about 125lbs, 36b. Fit perfectly"
5.0,To me it's so light weight I forgot that I have it on sometimes. Love the color it goes with everything.
5.0,This dress fits so well! It’s very flattering and I love all of the colors. I received many compliments when I wore the dress.
5.0,"I really like it, it felt good on my legs...."
5.0,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! Beautiful and comfortable fit.
5.0,"I wore this every day of the most brutal parts of the Boston winter while biking. It fits over the bulkiest hats and the fleece in the hood really cuts down on the wind.  Easy to wash, folds up small to fit in a backpack pocket, well made-- for the price it's a great product."
5.0,Finally a swim top that fits!  The adjustable straps make a huge difference and there is enough side coverage to avoid the dreaded side boob for a DD cup.  This is for my young teen who feels extremely self conscious when there is too much exposure up top.
5.0,My boy wears these socks a lot and they've held up well to his abuse & frequent washings!
5.0,So inexpensive but it does not look it AT ALL!  It's very pretty
5.0,"Such an ADORABLE shirt!!! I had open heart surgery, and I decided to get this shirt on a whim. It's soft, it's true to size, and it's adorable!"
5.0,Was getting tired of matching colorful socks lol the grip on these are great and the fit is expected. Maybe a little larger that other brands of this size but still fit well with room to grow
5.0,love this dress. I like the ombre color
5.0,"Quality stitching, great color. Anyone who has seen what these are based off of will know they're not the real deal, but they're obviously not trying to fake it anyways."
5.0,I love the Uno de 50 line of jewelry & this bracelet is great
5.0,Me encantó!!! Muy cómodo y se siente que protege muy bien. Fácil de lavar
5.0,"Love the mood charm, so different and unique."
5.0,"Nice wallet for the price! First impressions are great, let's hope the design doesn't fade too fast over time. I was looking for a smaller sized wallet to fit my smaller purse and it's perfect!"
5.0,I really love this belt. The material feels amazing.
5.0,The material is elegant
5.0,I have one in every bag and anyone I know who travels more than once a year really appreciates these as gifts.
5.0,I don't know about the HD part of even what it means but I like the tint and the fit. My second pair.
5.0,"Very nice, better than I expected!"
5.0,I love these glasses. They're much nicer looking in person. They are light and comfortable to wear. Will be buying more in the future.
5.0,It's cute!  Just like the photo.  Bought this as a gift.  When it first arrives it has that fresh ink smell to it.  I'm sure that will wash out.  It's a good size.  Comfortable fit.
5.0,Love the look of this and receive many compliments
5.0,I absolutely love this bag! Its a little small but It's perfect for on the go. The design on the bag matches my car seat covers too!! I'm highly pleased so far.
5.0,I love this bracelet great quilaty doesn't look like the price I paid. I have gotten a lot of compliments thinking about ordering the silver
5.0,Complements all around my husband says I  look hott ❤️
5.0,[[VIDEOID:f539bdcebbcc583c4214f9f092511ccb]] Previously purchased this set in blue and had to get white. As long as you wear nude tone underwear you should be fine with the white shorts. The jacket is also long enough to cover you if needed.
5.0,"Great concert T! I don’t understand all the bad reviews. Top is super soft, fits true to size. I’m 5’5” 135lb and ordered a small."
5.0,"Very soft , warm and comfortable."
5.0,"I am so happy with these! They fit absolutely perfectly. I'm 5'2"", weigh 108 lbs, and got a size small. They're so soft and the material is stretchy so they are incredibly comfortable. I can't believe they're only $15.99, I was shopping for jeans shorts just a few days ago and you're lucky if you can find a pair for $30, and hope they fit. These are so perfect!"
5.0,great length and great feel.  I did buy a size up because this style shirt usually runs small.  buying one size up seemed to enough...it fits well.
5.0,"Aloha,<br /><br />Pretty much fit as expected except for bottom hem.  It is slightly close to snug & I would have liked it a little more full.  However, it works....& I really like it!<br />Aloha,<br />Leipūpū"
5.0,These are just shoelaces. They did fit easily into sneakers that needed this extra length. Well made and  my  need.
5.0,Everything i like.
5.0,Wonderful product.  Great for kids and adults.  Makes shoes look classy and they go on with ease.  Wish I had discovered and purchased them sooner.
5.0,"Love these leg warmers, they are good quality and look really pretty on my little one .."
5.0,"We like Knockarounds as a brand, and my boys love these."
5.0,I absolutely love them. They're beautiful. I've gotten a lot of compliments.
5.0,"I have two of these now, in black and pink.  I get so many compliments on this dress!  I wish they had a size between the medium and small, because that would fit me better.  I bought the black in medium and the pink in small.  The pink shows a little more bulge than I would like, but it looks good too.  I may buy this again, as its the most comfortable dress I own!  It does great in the washer and dryer!"
5.0,"I've been wanting to get this toque for a long time and I finally pulled the trigger. It fits perfectly, I have a medium size cranium( 22 and 1/4) and its just right the way a beanie should fit. People with larger cavemen like heads this might be a little tight for you. I love the fleece liner on the inside and the minimalism of this hat it looks super cool. I got the green."
5.0,Cute<br />Rather small<br />Perfect for small face<br />Pretty design
5.0,"Picture doesn't do it justice! It has every color in it!! Not as purple as pictured, it is amazing!"
5.0,"This is the cutest little bag. Nice size I can put my wallet, Chapstick, eye drops etc in no problem."
5.0,I really love this wig! It's not super thin and it has really nice wavy curls. It is definitely one of my favorite cosplay wigs I have purchased from Amazon.
5.0,By far my favorite watch band. A good adjustment to fit just right and very comfortable
5.0,This is really nice worth the money will order another color
5.0,Great for working out !
5.0,Love this shirt soft like p.j.'s
5.0,i love this. it’s super cute. it does run large i got a medium and it’s really big but i like the look of it but if you want it more fitted size down.
5.0,I ordered this up one size according to reviews. It fits perfectly. I’m 5‘3“ tall and it’s above the knee but not too short. It’s a nice silky fabric with a slip attached inside on the front panel. Love it!
5.0,so soft
5.0,Received lots of compliments!
5.0,"Perfect Elvira costume, can't wait for our Halloween shin-dig this year!  I'm a size 14 and the Medium fits me perfectly.  It's snug, but it's Elvira - it's supposed to be snug!  The fabric feels nice against my skin.  I will need to reinforce the slit, it definitely needed a couple more stitches during the finishing process."
5.0,They kept in touch while I needed to send in my measurements for a custom fit. I was told I would receive my item  late October I received it last week the first week of September! It is a little big still in the waist and it came with padding in the chest. I will need to have my dress tailored still and the padding taken out. But so very happy with my purchase!
5.0,"I’ve been wearing two pairs of these earrings for a couple of years. I recently bought a replacement because I promptly lost one when I removed it for the first time since purchasing. Oops! If you’re like me and you lose earrings all the time, you’ll love that you can sleep, swim, etc in these without them coming loose, snagging on clothing, changing color, or causing discomfort. I wear the smaller sizes and they are so dainty and delicate. They’re lightweight but strong, I can’t feel them at all while wearing them. I previously ordered several other brands of similar earrings but they were too thick and looked cheap. Choose these ones!"
5.0,i just love it!
5.0,"My girlfriend's 15 year old son has been recovering from a traumatic brain injury when his head hit a pole. His symptoms have been varied (he had a stutter for a week that went away just as mysteriously as it appeared).<br /><br />A little while before I ordered these glasses, he said that he was having trouble reading an article because the text was swirling around the page.  It sounded like he was manifesting symptoms of Irlen's syndrome. I had read that colored glass could help, so I ordered a pair. They came in just as he was standing in front of the house chore chart.<br /><br />""Can you see what your chores are?"" I said.<br /><br />""No."" He moved his hands around wildly, indicating the direction of the swirling text in his vision.<br /><br />""Here."" I gave him the glasses. He put them on.<br /><br />""Whoa!""<br /><br />He says the text didn't stop moving altogether, but it's legible now.<br /><br />Not only do these glasses help him read, they take away his headaches and allow him to look at screens without upsetting the healing process. And he likes the Tony Stark look."
5.0,"I love the design and how this cardigan flows. I used it for a Sonia Nevermind swimsuit AU cosplay. It was a little tight around the arms, but other than that, awesome!"
5.0,I took the id holder off and swapped it for a silver carabiner with my keys on it.  Now it looks like my ride is an x-wing.
5.0,This is great quality and very comfortable
5.0,Got this for my 4 year old daughter and it is super cute and very durable.
5.0,Very well fitting and good workmanship.  Laundered well. Shipped quickly.
5.0,"This skirt is adorable! Was no see through, but I didn’t wear little spank shorts !"
5.0,I've been wearing this dress a lot during my pregnancy and it's perfect. I love it.
5.0,So beautiful. I love them.
5.0,"Item is lightweight and pretty. Very delicate material, be sure to check it when you receive it an be sure to follow label instructions. The seller is VERY concerned with customer service and quality. They email several times to ensure you are pleased with your purchase and if there is a problem they handle it immediately! I am pleased with the item and seller."
5.0,Super comfortable and super cute and perfect for warmer weather as they are not too thick
5.0,Used these for a video and they turned out great.
5.0,"The hat came totally crumpled up in a plastic bag, and when I removed the hat, it had creases in folds all over the place. But, it wasn't anything a bit of ironing couldn't fix. After I removed all the wrinkles and creases, the hat was as good as new, and looked absolutely beautiful. I love this hat!"
5.0,Nicely constructed!!
5.0,"love the fishnets, love the 3 sizes, they look super cute! nice and tight on my thin legs."
5.0,"I love holiday-themed jewelry and this bracelet if just adorable.  Finely crafted and detailed, I really can't wait until October to wear it.  It's for the adult wrist, too large for children."
5.0,Love interchanging them! Highly recommend!
5.0,"Some of the best socks I purchased for my son. These things actually look like he's wearing little jordans, even before he could wear shoes. now that he has outgrown them, I plan on framing them along with his outfit we took him home in."
5.0,Cute shoe. Normally wear 8 to 8-1/2 and bought an 8. It worked. Pix with outfit attached.
5.0,Awesome my watch band came with tools and everything to change out my band
5.0,"I love this hoodie. It was an instant hit at a Halloween party I went to. Good quality, great colors, and it's comfortable. It fits somewhat large for women's sizing, but definitely is not quite men's sizing. I am a size medium in women's tops. This hoodie in a size medium fits me more like a women's large would (it is too big, but I don't mind). My husband is a size medium in men's, but when he tried the hoodie on, he almost ripped the seams! So bottom line, if you're a woman, order a size smaller. If you're a man, order two sizes larger. This hoodie is not cut like a woman's hoodie, by the way... It is not shape flattering at all. I'm assuming it's unisex."
5.0,Great looking and fit. Real happy with it.
5.0,This is the second one I have purchased.  I wore the other until it was threadbare.  Love these nightgowns.
5.0,these are so cute my daughter loves them as well I am not a small woman 5ft 9in and curvy but they are slimming and I love them!
5.0,"back when these were a trend i would wear mine EVERYDAY for like years before it broke. i showered with it, worked out with it and slept with it. it was absolutely perfect"
5.0,Was told by doctor to wear compression socks due to edema in legs.  Other socks were too tight.  These fit snug and yet does not fit so tight as to leave marks on upper calves.
5.0,They arrived fast and as shown.
5.0,I love the whole package! Sunglasses are perfect and I considered that a bonus.
5.0,It is  beautiful cloth.
5.0,So cute and exactly what I wanted.
5.0,They matched perfect with my Kagome cosplay!
5.0,"I'm 5'4"" and 135 lbs. and bought the large.  I didn't want it to hug my body too much as I work in a school, so I sized up.  It's a tad big in the top around the shoulders but nothing too noticeable.  I wear it mostly with the wider belt which gives it a great look.  I love wearing it as it is soft and very comfortable."
5.0,"This vest has it all!  I have used it biking, hiking, exlporing Europe and just jotting around town.  Great alternative when you want to leave the purse behind."
5.0,I like the colors and the hooks in the front could make this perfect for breastfeeding moms who are exercising.
5.0,I usually wear a small. I’m either a size 2 or 4 depending on the brand. I got a medium and that worked perfectly for me. it is a little bit bigger than what I would usually wear which is perfect as it leaves space for an inner layer. I bought this for my Iceland trip. And it kept me dry at the waterfalls and in the ice caves.
5.0,This is so pretty and so far I haven't had any issues with it. I was afraid the stones might fall out when I bought it but it seems to be very durable.
5.0,I have gotten so many compliments and people asking me where I purchased this band. I wear it often and it has held up very well. There has been no fraying and it hasn't scratched. It is great quality and value.
5.0,Ideal compression
5.0,"I bought this small purse to use in a different way. I have limited mobility and needed a way to have my phone with me at all times. This worked out perfectly. It is light weight and the straps are thin, comfortable and adjustable. I adjust them to wear around my waist and the clip makes it easy to remove and put back on. I have room for my glasses as well as I  only need them for occasional use. Thank you for much for a much needed solution!"
5.0,"Great Watch, love it! Thanks"
5.0,These are wonderful
5.0,Beautiful necklace.  I absolutely love it and have warn it since the day I purchased it!
5.0,Fits great and looks pretty.<br />Enough said.
5.0,"I  wear slippahs  all the time but it has been very cold this summer.I discovered V-Toes  online and decided to try them out. they are great!  Stretchy, great fit.Comfy with slight padding  Love the Dragon design."
5.0,I ordered for my friends - they love it. Cheaper than other packing cubes
5.0,I Loved the Fit. It went great with my swimsuit.
5.0,"Oh man.. these dresses are the cat's meow.  I bought 2 and came back to order 2 more.  I am 5'7&#34;... 38DDD, usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  The XX fits me perfectly. I am a little busty so it's sort of empirish.. but doesn't look maternity.  And the best part?? POCKETS ladies!! Oh yes.  Lovely pockets that don't stick out. Just handy.  I wear them over my swimsuits... I dress them up with jewelry... and/or a jacket.  The prints are vibrant and clear.  The wash beautifully (I wash on delicate and tumble dry on &#34;low&#34;).  If you try one, you'll come back for more I bet.  This dress would fit a wide range of body types in my opinion. Further, as I travel a fair amount, they pack so nicely, without wrinkles!  Love love love. And I rarely get to say that about clothes of any kind.<br />UPDATE:  10/3 ...  I've gone back to order 2 other prints.  They wash beautifully.  Wear so comfortably.  The pockets are the key. Would love if they would come up with a sleeved version!"
5.0,💕💕💕💕💕great gramma liked her G G letters.
5.0,These dresses fit great and are very pretty.  I am so glad I took the chance and ordered
5.0,Great product. Thank you.
5.0,"Arrived on time, and I really love it!"
5.0,These are fun weekend capris. They are thicker material but keep me cool with the wide leg opening.
5.0,My wife loved them!
5.0,"Love this key chain, so pretty."
5.0,Most comfortable  socks! I wear at work or can be worn for hiking! Soft and breathable!  I need more!!
5.0,Hispan fits great and adjust s so it's not too tight. I love the colors they are so fun and festive! Will buy some other band from this Seller.
5.0,I look too cute with this hat!!!
5.0,"I am SO thrilled with this purchase. It's literally the softest sweater that I own. And I love that it's adjustable. I can keep the waste tight, and the shoulder stays nice and loose for that off shoulder look that's in style right now. I've already washed and dried it, and it still perfect. Buy this sweater! You won't regret it!"
5.0,"Cute earrings, I added them to my small regular hoops"
5.0,Perfect for the young ladies...
5.0,These are a spin must have!  They are expensive but worth every penny especially if you tushy hurts during spin!
5.0,Love this bag! It’s beautiful and perfectly made/designed…as all Matt & Nat bags are!
5.0,Really happy with it. This was a gift and the recipient loved it.
5.0,"Excellent belt which uses the power of magnets to hold up your pants. Looks and works awesome with any kind of pants, and adapts easily to shifting waistlines and can even accommodate Turkey Day bloat. Best belt you can get for your money, hands down.<br /><br />*The belt is not a miracle worker, but it certainly won't hurt your chances with the sexy people*"
5.0,I love Woolrich clothes. They seem to be very high quality and my Grandpa use to wear Woolrich when we would go fishing.<br />I cant always afford Woolrich but if theres a sale ill be first inline if its something i wear.<br />I cant wear normal pants because i get ulcers on my legs and jeans tear my skin. These are very thick and well made.
5.0,Super cute and better quality than expected. Size was as expected as well. Needed a size 4. That's what's we received. Very happy.
5.0,bought one for me and my best friend and i’ve wore it a lot since i bought it and no fading. love it
5.0,This is a great purchase for anyone needing chains for pendants or charms or just to have on hand for backups.  A good price and whichever size you need - saves a lot of time looking for the right length.  Well recommended.
5.0,I have no problems with this product. It's very soft and looks like the picture. I got mine in black. Definitely would buy more.
5.0,"I love these, not to pricey but so so pretty. Really beautiful colors and they look expensive while being well priced. I submitted a order for a couple more sets after I saw the the first order. I like the silver post rather than the gold, but both look good."
5.0,"Ordered XL. Fits really well. I usually have trouble finding shirts in this style because of broad shoulders, but it wasn't a problem here. I was under the impression that it was a button up shirt, it is not. Buttons are for decoration. Sleeve length is good too. I like this shirt. Would buy again."
5.0,"Bought this for my 9 year olds birthday and she loved it! So soft, and fit true to size."
5.0,Purchased for my friend in Mexico. Shipped quickly!
5.0,Super cute & fit great

5.0,"Really like the fit on this shirt, ordered another color as well"
5.0,Satisfied with product.  Correct size and no complaint of product delivery.
5.0,"At first I thought the waist would be too small, but once on everything fit fine. They were very comfortable. I liked the size of the small pocket provided. Good quality."
5.0,Loved this dress! Very flattering. The material was thick enough and was not see through (I was worried about it not being lined but it worked out very well!!) I received a lot of compliments - I’m so glad I purchased this!
5.0,LV vachetta match
5.0,As described. Thank you.
5.0,"So nice to have a tie that is long enough! I've quite tall and this tie works great. If you're used to wearing ties that are too short for tall people, it will take a few tries to get the right feel of where to tie the knot, but once you do, it's nice and even. I wish they had more colors!"
5.0,I love the look of this watch!<br />The band is beautiful and the face is very thin.
5.0,I really like this band. It's lightweight and easy to install
5.0,Great band and fast delivery.
5.0,Surprised my wife with this shirt and she loved it! Fits her perfectly!
5.0,"These are beautiful! The sparkle & the rich colors are amazing. Well-made setting . Very, very pleased."
5.0,"This is my go to hat for being outside in the Alabama summer. Since I had a precancerous spot removed from my face, I have gotten diligent about covering up from head to toe. I wear this whenever I go outside. The brim is wide enough to protect my entire face from the sun and the neck flap protects my neck. I've gotten plenty of compliments on it too.<br />The only problem I have is it makes it difficult to see branches hanging over my head if I'm wearing it on a hike (I wear it to keep ticks out of my hair in the woods too). I just make sure to look up a bit more than I normally would, and I can see the branches lurking above me."
5.0,"Work just fine in boat shoes, oxfords, and athletic shoes. Finally a true no-show that still feels like a real sock."
5.0,"My favorite earrings.  Classic, timeless, lustrous, sparkly."
5.0,My daughter loved these. They were cute and comfortable
5.0,Buy it! Fits good. Very soft.
5.0,Purchased for Daughter for Christmas and she loves it. They do fit small and I ordered a size up.
5.0,I bought these for my daughter who's getting married soon and she loved them.
5.0,Beautiful.I get compliments about it all the time!
5.0,granddaughter loves this t-shirt
5.0,"Look really good, not just for the price. Pleased"
5.0,"A little throwback to the 90s!<br /><br />This style of necklace was huge in the 90s for any kid who could spell the word &quot;surfboard&quot;. They look awesome, feel great, and are awesome quality.<br /><br />I'll be headed to Florida later this year and I was looking for a more beachy type necklace to wear while I'm beach-bumming it with my girlfriend. This set of TWO necklace will provide the perfect look! The clasp is perfect. It's just big enough to spin with my fingers and small enough to get lost in the design. It's a spin clasp, which means you put it together and give it a few twists - which is perfect for any adventure sports. You can totally go jet skiing or surfing and these won't fall off your neck or come loose.<br /><br />I was very happy with these and I'll probably buy a few more colors! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest feedback"
5.0,Got them for my daughter to wear in the shower. Great for college students because they may have to share a shower room with so many people.
5.0,"I love these bags! They are so sturdy! My old insulated bags were falling apart. The lining holding the zipper were separating from the bag and the silver insulated part was tearing inside of the bag. These are bigger than my old ones, can hold more, and have a bottom piece that easily folds down so I can carry heavier items, like milk and other things, with ease. I can't wait to buy more! I also have the brown earthwise groceries bags and love those too! I've dramatically cut down the number of bags I need and trips from the car to the house since I can carry so many heavier things easily. I love them."
5.0,"Super fun hats for the season! Fits my wife great, but is a little snug for me (7 1/2 - 7 5/8 Fitted hat size). I still looks great but won't keep my ears warm, but that's not necessary for Florida. All in all I love the hat."
5.0,I got this way later than I should have but it was worth every minute I had to wait. This necklace is the cutest thing ever! You can wear it as a choker or as a normal necklace. I’m so in love with it.
5.0,"Seriously amazing! Soft, perfect fit, can’t see through. Super deal! Really happy with my purchase !"
5.0,"I love, love, LOVE this case! This case is rather big but it's well worth buying in my opinion. It can hold one pair of large framed sunglasses or two small framed sunglasses. I have the cloth cleaner in mine as well as glass cleaning wipes. When you hold this case up to the sunlight you will see that the flowers on the case are red. I will definitely recommend this case to everyone I know."
5.0,"Although the title in Amazon is misleading, (these aren't Disney nor are they there for girls), I'm happy with the product. The stickers are durable and can used several times, which is great since belly photos take several shots usually!"
5.0,Llegó cómo se ve en la foto
5.0,I absolutely loved it. It was perfect for my event.
5.0,nice material! nice fit
5.0,"Shades were cute, they served their purpose. I have no idea where they are now"

5.0,Covers well
5.0,"This top is amazing, the color is as expected and the material feels good in the skin,it’s breathable and comfortable to wear. I like the detail of the lace at the bottom, this is a perfect top for summer or hot weather. It’s true on the size."
5.0,I love the way they look and made very durable
5.0,"Super Cute, fits well, sheer-a camisole is recommended but perfect for summer. LOVE it"
5.0,Cool. Quite cool. Thanks
5.0,These things are awesome. Had purchased 4 different pairs prior to these. All 4 pair broke for no real reason seems you can tie these in a bow and they would go right back to original condition. Great Glasses especially for the price!
5.0,I absolutely love this ring.  I fit wonderful...I love the style and comfort of the fit...I would highly recommend this ring to all...I am sure you will enjoy wearing it as much as I am.  The delivery of this ring was surprisingly quick....Great product!...Thank you!
5.0,"Thank you for making prescription strength glasses!  I’m stuck at home with now contact lens, no glasses and no access to an optician. I ordered these glasses, they came really fast and look expensive. Super stylish and exceeds my expectations."
5.0,Love this shirt. Nice material. Fit well.
5.0,Nice for casual or dress. Very nice feel to it. Great find.
5.0,Good product for a Good Price!!
5.0,fits well looks very nice on wrist
5.0,It is just as describe and thin. I bought it for myself (need one I can see when I don't have my glasses) also it looks very nice.
5.0,My daughter loved her pijamas!!  Worth it!
5.0,One pair to small useless.
5.0,"Surprisingly great fit and good quality. Now I've got 2 other replacements and I got the navy blue and gray. Looks great! The pink is a light pink, more like a cream color with a hint of pink. I like it. Fits perfectly and feels pretty sturdy. Worth it!"
5.0,"Nice size, not too big. Super cute!"
5.0,Just need a cheap but nice style pair of sunglasses and these are perfect.

5.0,Fit PERFECT
5.0,Great Quality..... looks sharp to add to your coat to display your pride in service.
5.0,So cute! Granddaughter loves it so much she wears the hat to bed.
5.0,"Cute!  Great price, nice and thick.  Seem well made for the price!"
5.0,I love this dress it's so beautiful... My daughter wore it for her graduation ceremony and we got compliments on her dress and I told dem I purchase it off Amazon Prime and look for Vivienne Honey dresses...
5.0,"This was a gift for my sister, she loved it. I have one too and it is great to sync with TV for quiet movie watching."
5.0,"This is the first product that I can say that will keep my hands from freezing. I don't have very good circulation through my hands, so they are always cold. The waterproofing is fantastic, but it will not allow sweat to dissipate, and that leaves your hands feeling wet anyway (if they get warm enough). The touch screen portions of the gloves seem to have unnecessary extra material. There's about 1/2"" extra space in the thumb and index finger and I have long fingers.<br /><br />These gloves will keep your hands from getting overly cold. However, I have used them in -30° weather and they start to let in the cold at that point. It is good to have something extra like a disposable hand warmer or something.<br /><br />I will say, though, that in your average cold/wintery conditions, these gloves will keep your hands warm and they will prevent any melting snow from seeping through the fabric. These gloves have a liner to help with insulation, which I prefer. They are comfortable and provide usable dexterity aside from the extra fabric in the thumb and index finger. I give it a 5-star rating because they actually work for me."
5.0,Very nice I like it a lot
5.0,This is a very nice top
5.0,I get so many comments on this mask.
5.0,Ordered this for a costume party one of my friends was having and it was fantastic. I got so many compliments. It was comfortable and I 100% recommend it!
5.0,It is so pretty.

5.0,Great quality set with a nice box for displaying.
5.0,No breaking in needed. These are great trail shoes.
5.0,"Got this for my mother for Christmas, she cried at how beautiful it was."
5.0,"Bought these to clean under the boat, they are simply excellent.<br />You can use both sides of your hand for hard to reach places and the glove surfice is perfect for removing all the grime and small barnacles.  Protect your hands from being cut to shreds too.<br /><br />So far had them a month and still going strong."
5.0,"Excellent quality, beautiful zip up hoodie."
5.0,"I love this keychain so much. The pictures don’t come solid like on the picture, they are see through like real film, which I actually like more. Definitely recommend!!"
5.0,So very pretty and looks good with any outfit and helps to remind me to look above and remember what is really important .
5.0,This is perfect for rainy days. It literally saved my shoes from getting dirty.
5.0,This house coat was made well of quality fabric. It’s also pretty and the color was accurate for what was pictured.
5.0,Fast delivery great quality
5.0,Looks like my beloved Gentle Monster brand of sunglasses. Good quality. I would've preferred a hard case instead of the fabric one because the sunglasses is very fragile and needs extra protection..
5.0,Wow... fits great!
5.0,The shirts fit perfectly and are so cute.  I love them!  They are exactly what they look like.
5.0,"The white is not really white, its more of an ivory color. I wanted white, the quality is very hood though. If you are looking for a white dress do not buy this as the dressnis not actually white. I purchased a large."
5.0,Its a great quality shirt. My husband i didnt know what to expect because it was so cheap. However it's a nice thick but not too think cotton blend shirt.
5.0,Excellent fit and fabric comes in wonderful colors.  Very comfy and soft matierial.  Love the panties and will reorder.
5.0,Great shades look great and are very comfortable!
5.0,These are solid good weight tags!!  The fact that they can also be engraved is a great plus. These are seriously great tags.
5.0,Love it.  Very comfy and fits great
5.0,"I paid $50 for the costumes, then won a $50 Amazon gift card in a costume contest. Not too shabby. Good quality, I recommend taking it out of the package and hanging it up for a few days to get the creases out."
5.0,This is a gift for my wife and I know she will love it.
5.0,"Friend that helps on the farm has HUMOUNGOUS feet and needed an inner sole to put in his rain boots to use in the winter so I ordered him these. Says he loves them - warm, comfy, FIT. No complaints"
5.0,"Mi hija tiene 3 años y usa casi ropa de 4 , le compre el 2-3 y le queda perfecto . Tengo otro conjunto 3-4 y es súper grande ."
5.0,"I have a smaller 8 year old that they fit very well and they fit but loosely on my 4 year old who is average sized. I have a larger than average 11 year old nephew and they don’t go over his head easily and the knit is stretched on his face, you can see separation in the pattern. I’d say this is best for under 10 and if they are a larger than average child it wouldn’t be the best. They are a single layer, but thicker than other fabrics. My kids say they are much more comfortable than their other masks. I like that they can pull them up and down with out taking them off and loosing them or getting sitting them on dirty surfaces."
5.0,very impressed with the quality of this boot. inside lining thick soft and very well insulated.  Boot itself quality feel to the boot thick not that cheap feeling thin stuff.  my daughter in law got the uggs for Christmas.  I have to say I feel I got the better of the deal for sure!  Sizing is true to size but if your looking to wear thick socks you could go up a size but with the way these boots are made you don't need thick socks.  All and all very satisfied with these boots.  I am very picky to say the least but I give 5 stars.
5.0,"These socks are wonderful! I am a runner and also walk a lot, so there is lots of wear and tear on my feet. I was hoping these socks would provide some useful cushioning as well as temperature control for my activities. After receiving the socks, I wore them for 48 hours and did almost everything... speed walking, running, general activities around the house. They are fabulous! No smell (at all), they feel nice and cushiony, and even protected my toes during the run. (Often the tips of my toes get bruised on longer runs). What was also nice is that the merino wool provided great temp control for my feet. We hit an unexpected 74 degrees here yesterday, but my feet did not get hot or sweaty. The wool is great for temperature control.<br /><br />I'm going to buy a pair for my husband, and also explore if Pro-Tect makes shorter socks (vs. mid-calf length) specifically for running!  But I'm definitely going to get great use out of this pair. **Disclosure: I received this item at a promotional price in return for my independent, unbiased opinion review. I am not affiliated with the manufacturer or distributor of this product.II"
5.0,Very stylish and perfect fit.
5.0,Warm and washes like a dream.  Love the colors offered. I like a loose sweatshirt so I can layer over a turtleneck. These were perfect for that. I wear one almost every day.  Sleeves are nice and long with no shrinkage after the dryer.
5.0,Loved these little rainbow charms! We made rainbow bead bracelets for my daughter’s party and these were a hit!
5.0,Perfect and as described!
5.0,"It fits perfectly on my child's feet, and I really likes the color and design of the shoes. Nice shoes!"
5.0,"Very good quality, thinnish merino good for warm or cool days, fine details. My other merino jerseys are a bit heavier, so this is nice. It is not a skin-tight fit compared to some cycling jerseys, cursory research would have revealed that. I like a non-racer fit. At 6'1&#34; and 185 lbs a Large fit me very well. Yes, wool jerseys will all sag when you overstuff them with heavy items - again, cursory research. That said, this one sags less than others I've had. The zipper pocket might be too small for today's giant cell phones, FYI. Wish there were other colors at this sale price."
5.0,"I needed a small apron for work. I thought maybe a restaurant server-style or carpenter apron. I didn’t know a cleaners’ apron even existed! When I found this I was a little skeptical because it seemed kind of long. Would it get in my way? I gave it a chance.<br />The fabric is a lightweight woven polyester and is a little slippery. It is not a cotton twill type fabric like you’d expect. It appears very well constructed. The body of the apron measures 21” wide by 14” long. The length has not interfered with my work.<br />There are five pockets, two on the top front that are about 10” wide and 8 1/2” deep, and three pockets behind, the right measures 10” wide by 12” deep, the center measures 4 1/2” wide by 12” deep, and the left measures 5” wide x 12” deep. You’re going to lose your phone at the bottom of any of these so just be aware.<br />There are four sewn-in fabric loops at the top for holding/hanging things, two on the front and two at the side seam. There are two clever hooks on the waist belt, one also doubles as the size adjustment/slide. Included are two loops made from metal cable that can be hooked through any cleaning tool with a hanging hole in the handle.<br />All but the front two fabric loops are useless to me because they are on the apron edge and on the adjustment strap. I’m very slender so the majority of the loops are at my center back. I have the waistband adjusted at about 29” which is just above the minimum adjustment of 26”. It looks like there could be up to an additional 24” of adjustment for larger sized waists. The waistband is a standard woven/webbed belt and plastic clasp that you squeeze to release. I have experienced no slippage or loosening at the waistband but that might be because I don’t have the apron loaded with heavy things or because there is even weight distribution all around.<br />So far I have used the front largest pockets for rolls of trash bags and my cleaning rags. I’ve used the front loops (the ones I can reach) to hold spray bottles. I’ve used one of the edges of the left top pocket to hold the handle of a duster out of my way. My phone goes in the back pocket of my jeans (where it has always been) so I can’t speak as to whether or not this apron had great phone storage like the pictures show. I’ve used the apron twice so I have yet to wash it. I will update my review if anything changes after multiple w earrings and washings over time."
5.0,I love these socks. They're warm and comfortable for long hikes!
5.0,"I love it and use it daily, as described, thank you"

5.0,"I love these glasses<br />I’ve had 3 pairs over the years. They are durable, great protection although a bit heavy on the face & wont stay on top of my head if doing working tasks. Not a product flaw just not lightweight rec type glasses. I love them!"

5.0,"I ordered this for my granddaughter - as just an everyday shirt.  The shirt was soft and relatively thick - not see through.  It fit as expected.  The fit is comfortable and as expected.  The colors are true, it didn't shrink or fade after washing.  The top looks just as it does on the web site."
5.0,Love the pattern and the fit.
5.0,"I surprised my SO with a trip to Orlando only to find the predicted weather was going to be rain. Thankfully, it only rained one day but it really poured. I am sooo glad I bought this jacket for myslef and my boyfriend (this version), all of our belongings (including paper tickets) remained dry as a bone in our pockets and we were super dry as it poured on the crowds decked out in overpriced trash bags. This jacket fits like a glove and looks great! We are so happy with our new jackets!"
5.0,"I bought two of these when they were on sale, and gave one as a present to Mom. I love this company and what it stands for, and so does my mother. This isn't the only item I own from Benevolence L.A., and it won't be the last. I know the chain itself felt slightly flimsy at first, but it's held up to me and I tend to break things. I have yet to break it.<br /><br />Chain is a nice length though, a bit off-color from the 'Love' pendant. The charm itself is more of a true gold color, very shiny, and petite. Mom loved the length of this necklace, and so do I."
5.0,I brought this for a M/C party (motorcycle club) it was cute.
5.0,It it ok

5.0,"It is really good, seems like on photo"

5.0,"Big, long and pretty. Exactly as pictured. Perfect weekend earrings for a cheeky and classy look. Highly recommended"
5.0,VERY comfortable and soft. Good support and shape. Straps aren't too restricting. Seriously love this one!
5.0,"This is a beautiful multifaceted necklace with loads of sparkle. It is just the right size and weight on the neck. I plan to wear it with cardigan sets and pleated A-line skirts this fall to create that classic, lady-like look that I love to see and emulate this time of year!!"
5.0,"Awesome product- authentic,very well made,I highly recommend this business!! Fast delivery, and I am very pleased!"

5.0,Cute and fun!
5.0,"I bought these because I had ankle surgery, and  it's taking forever for the wound to close. I'm able to walk again, but all I can wear are flip flops because they don't put pressure on the wound.  Now that Fall is here, my feet are getting chilly.  These are perfect, and they are actually kind of cute."
5.0,Great wire!
5.0,Easy to wear around house or town.
5.0,The perfect gift for my sister
5.0,Best socks anywhere. Soft and wicking.
5.0,"These pants are so cute, and the fleece lining makes them great for the winter. The only thing is they shrink if you put them in the dryer so make sure you air dry them! Otherwise no complaints!"
5.0,"I like the material and fits great,I expected to be a little longer but I love it anyways,will be great with some faux leather pants,also beautiful details on the sleeves!i love it!!!"
5.0,Nice tight fit
5.0,these look good and the lining is great the touch screen works as well but it doesn't seem the most reliable thing though that may just be cause it doesn't fit my hands perfectly
5.0,Precious. My girls loved it and made of very sturdy material

5.0,The Yoga sock were perfect.
5.0,"I have very sensitive eyes and so I am always on the lookout for a good and stylish pair of sunglasses.  These definitely get the job done.  I like the very slight cat-eye shape of the lenses and they have dark enough protection for my highly sensitive eyes.  I liked that they are lightweight and very much stayed in place.  My 10 year old daughter liked them too and so now we are ""fighting"" over them which is a good sign of a great product!"
5.0,is great
5.0,Very good product fits perfectly<br /> Wry good quality
5.0,"Love this, it fits perfect and it looks great."
5.0,"My wife really likes the earrings alot. They are much better than the dangling earrings, of which I have no idea what she means but it might be useful for you. Also she said the earring backs are the very best."
5.0,"Very very nice. It’s better than I thought. It was a gift  and I haven’t  seen it on my daughter except when she first put it on to see if it fits. I would purchase another for her, and it’s nice enough to buy as a gift."
5.0,My husband loved these glasses. This first pair took a long time to arrive but the second pair arrived soon. He loves the glasses because they do not fall off when he is working on vehicles.
5.0,Great tie well made and looks great.  Extra long for guys with large necks like me
5.0,This belt is nice on all outfits.  It fits waists from medium to large sizes.  It adds style to any outfit.
5.0,Very nice dress. Color is great
5.0,They look so good on and just like the one Rihanna wore. A couple rhinestones came off when I tried it on for the first time but that’s so be expected because my wide face stretched the frame a little bit. I’m going to super glue them back on as well as put a thin layer of it over the other rhinestones for good measure. I just can’t believe how amazing the quality is. Definitely recommend
5.0,Perfection!!! Just exaclty what I ordered and expected.
5.0,"I went to our hometown mall and found this purse in a store and fell in love. BUT I was not about to spend $108.00 on it. Then I thought more and more about it and decided its ok to splurge every now and then and was going to treat myself, well I did my search on Amazon because it just seemed easier to purchase through prime if possible and **BOOM** there it was for $52..HALF THE PRICE.. double checked sizing and everything and it all matched so I ordered it. I have been complemented multiple times and went by the store and it is for sure the exact same thing. Love it !!!"
5.0,Ordered these as a Gift and the recipient was happy with my purchase for them. I'm glad I ordered them.
5.0,"I am in love with this bathing suit. My measurements are 32.5”, 25”, 37”. I was a little worried about the bottoms since I am usually a medium in those, but they fit me well, just a little bit tight. I am also an A cup but the top made my girls look bigger than they actually are, it’s amazing!!"
5.0,I wish I could buy these again!!! These are the best earrings I’ve ever owned!!
5.0,Very cute dress!
5.0,Good price - good product - shipped quickly.

5.0,This is just beautiful
5.0,I would buy again.
5.0,Shirt came on time and was exactly what I ordered! It was pretty and fit perfectly.
5.0,Nice fit.  Well constructed.  I look like a dork but the glasses save my neck when I’m belaying a top roper for hours on end.
5.0,"Bought as a gift and recipient is very, very happy. Can't stop talking about it. Well made and very warm. Exceeded expectations. May have to buy another for myself."

5.0,DD loved it!  Charms work only on Crocs without the fur liner.
5.0,I love it...it's a gorgeous rose pink!
5.0,The belt was for my son. He stated he really liked the belt. Doesn't stretch and buckle stays secure.
5.0,Just got these in the mail today and I'm actually quite impressed! At first glance they look too short but as soon as I got them in my lip they were a perfect fit! Not too short and not too long. The balls and spikes were easy to screw in place and so far haven't had them unscrew and fall off. Great quality I shall order more next pay check 👍
5.0,My daughter's second birthday party dress. She looked so adorable. The material is ok too.
5.0,I am very happy with this purchase. Was able to repair my packs myself.
5.0,This bar is one of the few that actually fit correctly in my ear without a struggle.
5.0,I love the enhancers that go with this
5.0,I love these.  They are so cute.  No pilling or shrinking.
5.0,Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it!  Super cute!
5.0,"The bag did appear to be a good quality but I did return because it is very small- if you do not intend to carry much, I think this little crossbody would be perfect for you. I would say that you could get a wallet, camera, and small bottle of water and that would be about it."
5.0,I love the product...
5.0,"The outer layer collects pet hair easily, but I’m used to that, since I have pets; and have a constant battle with it ;-)"
5.0,"Very satisfied with this shirt. Its very good quality and it fit great. I was afraid it was going to be tight fitting when I got it but it wasn’t at all, and it wasn’t too loose. I would definitely buy more."
5.0,Really good quality I thought it feel kinda cheap but no at all I love it and I really recommend great accessory
5.0,"The dress is well-made. My daughter wears a 1X and is usually hard to fit. The bodice is not too loose, the waist sits slightly above her natural waist, so not too tight, and the skirt is nicely gathered. She was smiling because she finally found a dress she can wear."
5.0,"These gym pants are great! I got a compliment about them the first time I went to the gym with them as well.<br /><br />I am about 5’4” and 155 lbs. I work out consistently, and have fairly strong/large thighs. The size medium fits me perfectly. The fabric stretches enough to be very comfortable but they never start sliding down. No tugging needed! Also, I ordered the purple color and they are squat proof!<br /><br />I will purchase them in different colors as well. This is an amazing quality, especially for the price."
5.0,Beautiful sure my granddaughter wil love
5.0,"The belt is very nice looking and fits perfectly. Order the size as their chart recommends and it will fit. The leather is great and the color is consistent throughout, great product!"
5.0,So cute but I wish it was longer
5.0,This fit my son great! The only thing is that the pants were a little baggier than I thought they would be. It still looked perfectly fine though. I loved this on him!
5.0,"Bought for my bf hes a size 11, little bigger than the norm but all G' real nice slippers for a good price :)"
5.0,"Super cute! I was expecting it to be above my belly button, but it covers all the extra &#34;pooch&#34; nicely. Im 5'0 and 160 lbs, size B cup and I ordered a large. It fits nicely!"
5.0,Amazing watch!!
5.0,"I love this dress and I ordered more. I have 11 colors so far!!!  It’s a fun dress.  Soft material. I am 5’6 and 185.  The small fit great and still had lots of room. So nice I bought in over five colors, both long and short sleeve.  Gonna get more colors.  Great in summer or with a cardigan."
5.0,I love it and its just right.
5.0,Perfect size and weight. This was for a gift and it was well received.
5.0,I ordered the burgundy and the color is nice but I thought it would be a little brighter. I didn't take off a star because this is now the most comfortable shirt that I own. I thought it would shrink after washing but so far I haven't noticed. I will be ordering more colors.
5.0,"LOVE, and the not I got with my earrings was AMAZING!!! thank you so much!"
5.0,Can't much go wrong with plastic. Easy to stick in the glove box for surprise rain storm.
5.0,Exactly as picture. Beautiful bracelet!
5.0,This set is super comfy. I love it! Color is great and I love all the pockets too. My k on not con is that is short on me but I’m taller than most.
5.0,True to size !
5.0,I got these to wear to a tribute band concert and they was perfect.
5.0,Happy I bought this!
5.0,"Good product. Arrived on time. Note size, was good for me, may be large for others"
5.0,Nice hat which only came in black but was blue when i received it.
5.0,"These have helped so much! The only thing I dislike is they do not prevent blisters. Which is okay, could just be the shoes I wear. They have for sure helped with swelling and knee pain!"
5.0,"I ordered the multi-color nose studs and I’m happy with the purchase!  They are so cute and fun.  I’ve had my nose pierced for 15 years and I always buy the small nose studs, just like these.  Anything else seems too gaudy to me (personal preference).  These are the perfect size and exactly what I want.  I love the fun colors so I can change them with my outfit.  My only issue is that the nose stud I currently have is shorter and thicker than these.  I don’t want my piercing to close or get tighter so I will alternate still and change them out to keep the hole at the bigger size.  The picture posted shows the differences (right stud is my current, left is the new stud).  I also like the shorter ones because in the past, if I hit my nose, the shaft is less likely to puncture my nose and bleed.  But the longer shaft is okay and not a deal breaker.<br /><br />Don’t be scared off by the picture of the girl on this, they are not nearly so big. And a pet peeve of mine….check the spelling on your products: “SURGLCAL” is not a word (picture).<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with this and look forward to changing them out.  This is probably more than I would ever need but happy that I get the choice.  It’s also nice and compact so I can carry them with me when I travel.  I also don’t have to worry about losing them because I can just stick them in the foam material.  Thanks!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.  All opinions are completely my own.  If my review helped you, please click YES."
5.0,Its perfect
5.0,Shipped amazingly fast. Fits exactly as pictured. I am thinking of buying again in another color!
5.0,Love the color and fit. Fabric is lightweight and comfy. Would definitely recommend this product.
5.0,Have been wanting a pink face watch.  This is adorable.  I have a 7.5 wrist and it fits perfect with a little wiggle room to spare.  Would love it more if it were stainless steel.
5.0,Luv it feels good
5.0,The monkey bath robe is adorable and incredibly soft! Order a size up.
5.0,BEST SET BAG EVER!!!!? I've had this for 2 years now and love it soooo much
5.0,"I love all hoodies, mine fits loose but I still love it. It's really hard to hate a basic nike hoodies"
5.0,"This whistle is a little larger than expected but nonetheless very nice.  Lots of sparkle and a sturdy chain.  However, it doesn't work.  Just for show."
5.0,"Of all of the sandles my wife has worn, these are the most flexible. A lot of times, shoes like this are stiff, but this one flexes nicely (in the soles).<br /><br />The quality is great. What's really cool is that she instantly felt the support for her feet, especially her right foot (which gives her the most problems). This is exactly what she needs for any tasks that involve going out. Absolutely awesome."
5.0,Perfect size for all my necessities!
5.0,This ring was exactly what I was looking for to pair with another ring. High quality ring for the price.
5.0,Great fit and great material.  I love the modest style
5.0,This top is Perfection! I'm 160 5'8 34 DD & the medium fits perfectly. I'm ordering all the colors!
5.0,Gorgeous.  Love it. Good fit.
5.0,Good watches for this price. Works good
5.0,Love these slippers!! Fit and look awesome!!
5.0,This is a gift but they are super cute and appear to be high quality
5.0,"Sweet bag, only wish it had a couple addl interior pockets"
5.0,Really comfortable just to wear around or to the gym so you can see your results from a good work out.
5.0,Love these glasses! Great fit! Comfortable and stays in place and I love how they look! I’ve been looking for aviators forever n finally found these. Great purchase
5.0,I love this thing. This is the only sleeping cap that don’t come off my daughter head during the night. I going to buy more
5.0,"Ordered this dress in two colors last summer (2018). Have worn them countless times. Washes well while retaining color and shape. Comfortable, great for vacations and everyday."
5.0,My son absolutely loves them!
5.0,I've gotten so many compliments on these. I love them! I purchased a case for it so it doesn't scratch.
5.0,"Shoes are a hit tight around ankle and a bit loose in toes.  Being leather, the tightness should ease over wearing."
5.0,"Out of 40 pieces, 12 didn't work. For the cheap price I was not surprised. The ones that did work were nice and bright. The kids loved them. They still work after a week of use."
5.0,"Really soft material, very comfortable. I thought the package was lost when it was delivered (it was in the mailbox but it was a Sunday so I didn't think to check) I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and responsive. I'm 5'9 with a slender to medium build, 140 lbs. I ordered a medium. It fits almost perfectly, maybe a hair bigger than I expected. If you are between sizes go with the smaller size over the bigger. Perfect length too since I'm tall."
5.0,"I'm a curvy, heavy chested, petite gal, size 12. The XXL fit beautifully! I'm 5'3&#34;, hour glass shape, 38F. Very excited to have this--great for job interview, business meeting, baby shower, date to the theatre!"
5.0,"This is a fabulous product.  I have wide feet with a high instep and my sneakers and loafers, etc. are too tight for socks.  These do the trick and they never slip down in the back.  All the others I have tried so.  I ordered more.  Rinse out and dry in a jiffy too."
5.0,"Love this dress! It is so comfy and flattering! It has adjustable straps AND pockets! I've received compliments from strangers every single time I've worn it! It's super light weight but not see thru. For reference I'm 5'3"", 175lbs, 38 DD, and ordered the XL. It fits perfectly-not too tight and not too loose. It'd be nice if it was a little shorter (hits just below my knees), but with wedges it works perfectly!"
5.0,"These earrings are SO adorable! Just stunning. Magnet holds together very well, they have a decent weight to them so there’s no worries about my holes closing up while wearing them. So classy and cool."
5.0,"Received this quick! Good quality, fits perfectly on the last clasp where I wanted it to lay right above my collar bone but if you wanted it shorter it can be worn so. It was a great purchase and I'm happy to learn that a percentage of my purchase has helped others thru charity. I will buy again from Benevolence! :)"
5.0,"I was worried that these would be way too big to fit over my son’s glasses, but they’re perfect! He’s excited to have them. The case/sleeve to keep them in is nice as well."
5.0,"The fit is great. Printed pattern is vivider than the photos from amazon, which is prettier."
5.0,Birthday gift for my beat friend he refuses to take them off day or night
5.0,"I bought these to go under wide-calf boots, and they are very nice.  One of the buttons fell off, but was easily repaired, and not enough for me to complain.  I've had several boot socks that just aren't made for a wide calf, so I was quite happy with the way these fit."
5.0,Perfect for swimsuit cover up.
5.0,"Very cute! True to size, so definitely order your normal size, if you are in between maybe go down because it has adjustable straps for the top. I’m bigger chested and it fit perfect. The tie in front can slip down but tie is tight and it looks fine."
5.0,I wear an XL motorcycle helmet and these bad boys fit my noggin perfectly! Never again will I purchase tinet gas station shades
5.0,This was a gift for my wife. She liked it a lot. I’m very satisfied. Arrived on time. Same as shown. 100 % recommended.
5.0,Yes l loved this product. Used it for jogging!
5.0,Very pretty. Solid feel to it.
5.0,"Perfect, been looking for one of these for years, love it!"
5.0,Beautiful! I’m in LOVE!😍
5.0,The material on this shirt is very soft and is a good bit thicker than your average blouse or t shirt. The weight of the material prevents it from getting bunched up or wrinkled throughout the day and it goes with jeans or slacks well. It has an interesting asymmetrical shape that gives it a bit more of business casual look despite it not having sleeves. It’s definitely the most comfortable shirt I own and I’ve been wearing it on “casual Friday’s” at work.
5.0,5'6&#34; 160 lbs with 36DDD bust<br /><br />Got an xxxl - Should have gone one size smaller but will work perfectly when my baby bump & bust fill in! Just ordered another in a size down for now. My husband loved it.Very flattering and allowed me to run around with my 2 year old without fear of falling out.
5.0,"Adorable, fun and comfy! LOVE!"
5.0,Love it! Good fit
5.0,As expected. Ordered for the whole office
5.0,Love these chains
5.0,This jacket was a gift for my sister and I kept putting it off to open because I ordered a large and then thought best check it out.  Sure enough the jacket was more like a size small I am trying to return it but think I may have waited to long cause there is no return button on the order anymore.
5.0,Love the fit of this shirt.
5.0,"These are adorable!  I purchased these, for one of my grand daughter's 11th birthday presents.  She wanted a Unicorn stuffed animal.  I purchased these slippers, as an additional surprise!  And, what a surprise they were!  She fell in love with them immediately!<br />The slippers are extremely soft, fluffy and comfy.<br />The colors are very vibrant and eye catching.<br />The slippers are well constructed and fit as expected.<br />I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and I'd highly recommend buying them."
5.0,Perfect for my 5-year old kindergartner! She loves it!
5.0,I loved them. I experienced snow for the first time and these thermal were awesome layers.
5.0,"I love it! It is stylish, I love the color, fits well, and is easy on and off even when wet. I especially liked that the shorts/bottoms were a lining that went all the way up past my waist. So I could easily slip on pants or leggings and the top covered it without bunching up."
5.0,I thought this was a great dress but I had to return it.  Dress is very short and I am only 5’6. If it was just a little longer it would had been perfect shockingly good quality for the price.
5.0,This is a very cute switch keychain.. I expected it to be smaller but it is a pretty big size. it's too big to be carrying around with keys  It is a little bigger than the key itself.
5.0,"Fit is suitable for a bodybuilder with muscular arms, chest and back and a narrower waist.  My husband also likes it because it gives him enough space around his neck.  Wears well.  Washes nicely."
5.0,I love these socks. I knit my own socks and these are just like hand made in all the right ways. They are definitely worth the money. I will be buying more.
5.0,Came as described. Was bought as a gift and he loved them. I enjoyed the pixel design.
5.0,Great socks comfortable and are great to wear through out the day
5.0,"They are a little tight in the beginning but they will stretch out overtime. I put them through the washer and dryer and they turned out fine. Exactly what I needed, full head coverage. Great for the winter and even the fall. You can even put a warmer over it if you like because it’s low profile. I would recommend these if you’re looking for a lightweight alternative to a winter cap."
5.0,K Bell has great socks!  The seam ar the end of the toe is not irritating and I cannot stand to feel the seam.
5.0,my dght loved it
5.0,Somewhat large but because its a wrap around it was perfect.  Great fix and material..
5.0,Daughter loved them for grand baby! Great material!
5.0,I got mt kids these socks for gymnaatics. They do parkour. They love the grip and the open toes. I recommsnd these socks!
5.0,These are my new favorite everyday earrings. I have worn them everyday since I received them.
5.0,Cute wallet that can also be used as a clutch. Very happy with my purchase!
5.0,Great tags with a metal loop for attachment. Well made.  Perfect for my new luggage set.
5.0,"This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old son.  I bought size small. He is 5'9"" and it fits perfect with some room to grow.  He loves this shirt"
5.0,"Surprisingly soft and well made, doesn’t seem like they will fray easily. MUCH more comfortable than the standard sport band."
5.0,Perfect in every way.
5.0,It was a gift for my nephews and their dad. They love them.
5.0,"Great value! I was surprised at the quality for the price. I did order up a size based on the reviews and it fits fine. Love the color. Just wish I'd ordered the short sleeve one also while it was on sale. But since it's so inexpensive anyway I will order it at the regular price. May also order different colors for spring. Not too sheer, so I don't have to wear a cami under it. Will be a nice addition to my wardrobe as soon as the snow melts."
5.0,"I love the shirt, just wished there where more choices of shirts."
5.0,"I get compliments on it. Being in the south, the warmer winter can cause thicker sweaters to be uncomfortable, this sweater is light enough to be comfortable in a wide range of weather."
5.0,Awesome and cheap! thanks!
5.0,I like the dress but a little long for me as I'm 4&#34;11 and the large fit me well I weigh 115 to 120
5.0,"A very unusual piece, but very comfortable and easy to wear next to the skin or over a blouse, tee-shirt or turtle-neck.  The chain is a good length if wearing against the skin as a &#34;bib&#34;, but requires extender(s) if wearing over a turtleneck.  Not too flashy, but large enough to draw attention, won't tarnish, so will be easy to maintain."
5.0,These are too small will reorder larger size
5.0,Exactly what i needed
5.0,IT'S OK for me.
5.0,Loved it. Same as shown in pictures.
5.0,These trumpets are the perfect size and quality.  I attached them to birthstone bangle bracelets for my mother and myself to commemorate my late brother's 60 birthday.
5.0,"Love these. So soft! Nice and warm, but not so warm I can't wear them around the house.<br />Buy these!<br />I'm a tall girl (5'10"") and the longs fit over my heels like I like. Perfect!"
5.0,"I bought these for my wife as a spontaneous gift.  Some people remarked that they were too big, so I knew what I was getting.  They are large &#34;pancaked&#34; dangle pearls.  Beautiful and unique.  We love them!  They bring a smile to my bride's face!"
5.0,"So, I bought this strap for my watch. A few years later I needed to buy another one. I loved it so much I bought the exact same one again. I think that pretty much says it all right there. Oh, my watch is a Nixon 51-30 Chrono. The fit is perfect."
5.0,"What I read about this before purchasing in its description is exactly what I got.<br />Love that!<br />It truly is very lightweight, windproof and breathable! Mostly using for extra protecting under my helmet when riding my motorcycle."
5.0,i bought this necklace for my 3 granddaughters and they loved it.  the color was so pretty
5.0,Beautiful.<br />Lighter shade than the photo..<br />It's Vegan 💚✌🏾
5.0,I bought 4 pairs of these for my daughter after she stole my other iLoveSIA tights/pants....she absolutely LOVES them!  Very nice quality and they look great on her!
5.0,"So I did wait awhile until I was able to try out the glasses, and wow what a difference... they really help out a lot."
5.0,"It fits and looks exactly like picture, I am so pleased and excited to wear them around!"
5.0,"love it, fits well and hasn't broken like other ones I've purchased :-)"
5.0,"Beautiful dress, perfect fit,  timely delivery...would definitely purchase from this comp and designer again...it was a hit in my daughter's wedding..."
5.0,"This product was exactly as advertised. I was worried that they wouldn't fit over my shoes, but they ended up being perfect. They keep your feet dry and protected while biking in poor weather while still allowing you to grip the pedals. These are a good solution for anyone who has to ride in cold or wet conditions."
5.0,"Just the right size. Sturdy, Nic. I do with it had a double zipper."
5.0,This fox fur in white is so soft and beautiful.
5.0,Finr
5.0,SUCH A COMFORTABLE FIT as well as fashionable style!
5.0,They do a great job of keeping the sheets in place.
5.0,Beautiful earrings! Very happy!
5.0,The box should have been made of heavier cardboard.  It was all collapsed when it arrived.
5.0,Thought both masks where adult normal the grey one is for youth
5.0,What did I like it? the Design and the Material the size small if perfect for me.  What I don't like it is the Material it is not good to use washing machine it is better to hand wash it!
5.0,I loved everything about this dress
5.0,Totally meet my expectations
5.0,Love it! Great fit. Use the size chart. Very forgiving material. Great deep color consistent throughout. Lace is soft and not itchy.
5.0,Fits my daughter perfectly.  Very good quality.  I couldn’t be happier with this purchase.
5.0,Comfortable I do however have a smaller face so it's a tad big on me but I roll the end over the bridge of my nose and it works just fine.
5.0,Loved this comfy two piece workout set! Fabric is flattering and loved the gray color. Very comfortable and easy to wear!
5.0,"I bought the 12M for my 3M old (50th percentile height/weight) and it's a bit large. I'm sure it'll still fit at 6M. The smell was very strong when I opened the package but after a wash, it was fine; I buy unscented everything so I'm very sensitive to smells. So far it has lasted through three washes with no issues. Baby loves running her fingers along the furry vest. I don't have any other polyester clothing for baby but I really needed something to keep her warm and this did the trick. Anyway, we wear it over a sleeper/one-piece so it doesn't touch her skin."
5.0,Excellent product quality and design  at this very low cost.
5.0,"great deal, fits great"
5.0,Great costume and compliment to my Little Red Riding Hood. It was slightly saggy in the back end but it did not take away from the costume.
5.0,"Chic and minimalistic. Very comfortable to wear, and it’s just as expected. Going to be an every day staple."
5.0,Excellent buy for the money!
5.0,Perfect I love them!
5.0,Beautiful print! Loved the quality!
5.0,Want to order this shirt in other colors I love that I can wear it tucked in or out and still looks good either way
5.0,I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this set was. It is even prettier in real life than in the picture!  It came in a nice box and was very well packaged.  The best part is that my 7 year old niece loved it!
5.0,Was good fit. Little pricey
5.0,"Awesome! Followed advice to go a size larger than usual - I always take a size small but ordered a medium. They're still slightly tighter than I would've liked, but still great."
5.0,They do exactly what they are supposed to do
5.0,#worthit
5.0,"These are the perfect plus size pants! Perfect fit, length and everything!  I feel like a WOMAN in them!  Thank you!  I'm planning on ordering more!!!  To whomever created them:  HURRAH!!!!!"
5.0,This is exactly what I hoped for when I ordered it! The seller was awesome and I would order again from this seller.
5.0,It's a bit long but I love it!
5.0,"Ultimately it is worth the money. However, it runs a tad loose and I have a large noggin. I had to hand punch a smaller tighter snugger fit. No biggie, about 3 minutes of work. I am concerned I or a stronger person could crush the plastic choker ball. I cannot for the life of me do so, however the the type of plastic is a tad suspicious. Don't let this hold you back though. It is indeed a great first timer hood. If you have some years under your belt, look elsewhere for a small price increase to get a nicer piece. Enjoy."
5.0,"These are very comfortable, the straps seem more comfortable than any bra that I have ever owned.  I did order a larger size that I usually wear."
5.0,"Great product! My kid does a lot of baking, and they wanted a specific kind of apron--durable, strong, and with deep pockets. These definitely fit the bill at a very reasonable price!"
5.0,"Very  versatile  set, perfect fit"
5.0,"This color is stunning, fabric is soft, fit is perfect!  Get it Ladies!!"
5.0,"I bought this to see if I even liked the concept of this style wallet over a traditional one.  This product may not be right for everyone, but it turns out I love it."
5.0,Excellent quality!
5.0,Very pleased with these cufflinks.  The enamel thoroughly covers the design and they feel like quality metal.
5.0,all i git to say about this ring it was more than i expected it is relay nice and wears good buy it
5.0,Well constructed sandal. Comfortable and fits true to size. My foot is narrow and it fits well.
5.0,"Love these although the length is ridiculous<br />Im 5'10 and I got a medium and they are about 4"" too long"
5.0,"great item...just love it! great dealer, too...fast shipping!"
5.0,Love the purse. Great price and super cute!
5.0,Beautiful.  As described
5.0,Real.com love them
5.0,"This swimsuit is very high quality, well-constructed, does not look flimsy or like it’s going to fall apart after washing. It’s not see-through at all. The print is vibrant and sharp. The price is unbeatable. Thank you!"
5.0,Exceptional ptoduct that does exactly what it says!!
5.0,"Purchased mine in 2016 & it’s still holding up. I love it.<br />My iPhone 8 Plus fits perfectly.<br />Hopefully I won’t jinx myself lol, but I will def be buying again ."
5.0,"I got this D&S Polarized Ski Goggles for my brother. He loves skiing and they are perfect for him. The glass is anti-UV, anti-scratch and ant-impact perfect for keeping the lenses clean so you can have a crystal clear view. The glasses have venting ports to control airflow to help preventing clogging from snow, ice and moisture. These vents are designed to reduce fogging inside of the lens.  These goggles can be wear with glasses underneath, this feature is perfect because my brother wear glasses. The frame is flexible and super comfortable and it has a silicone elastic strap that stays in place. This googles are lightweight, comfortable, windproof, sandproof and perfect for many sports. I strongly recommend this product.  I would have no hesitation buying this item again or as a present for someone! If my review helped you in any way can you please click the like button! I received this product at a discounted price in order to try it out and leave and honest and unbiased review. This does not influence my review at all. I try this product from a regular buyer’s point of view.  I do not get paid or compensated in any way so I have no reason to give a good review if the product does not deserves one."
5.0,Feels great and of high quality
5.0,Cute tie made well great quality
5.0,The fit is perfect and great quality.
5.0,Excellent quality material. Ran big as I purchased for waist size and that was unnecessary with elastic waist. Arms at cuff too tight but I have thicker arms.
5.0,"I love these earrings!  I purchased them to wear at a dance demo for St. Patrick's day, unfortunately they were out of stock, but were sent to me within the next week.  That's ok, because our outfits are green with the shamrocks, so I'll be wearing them a lot!  They're beautiful and the company was very good to work with -- they promised if they couldn't get them back in stock, I'd have something comparable sent to me."
5.0,"I bought to use for part of my Halloween costume. It's good quality, fits very good. I plan on using it for more than Halloween as well."
5.0,As described! Cute and spacious! Good quality!
5.0,Great product and the perfect size.  I was even able to put my Samsung Note5 in there with problems.  It looks nicely made and doesn't look cheap.  Well worth the price paid!
5.0,The necklace was perfect made well. Worth the money. Looks really nice on great size thick chain and pendent was a good size.
5.0,"These are so cute! Bought 12 pairs of corgi socks for a male friend for Christmas and this seller was kind enough to send 2 additional corgi designs for free, which was very nice!<br /><br />Sizing- though these are stated as unisex, they’re probably not for men with very large feet... probably best for women and men size 9 and smaller- maybe men size 10 even<br /><br />Print/quality- print is bright and clear- it’s worth noting that the print is only on the top part of the sock, and the bottom/sole is plain white. Print is not blurred or distorted much when wearing. These are thin socks and stretchy and great for hiding under men’s dress shoes, says the recipient<br /><br />Great quality, very cute- wish Shelley offered a shipping discount though as shipping makes these affordable socks a bit pricy, but still good buy and i recommend for corgi lovers"
5.0,I needed some more compression socks. The ones I had was ok but these real does the job. And simple instructions that all the other brands need to follow. Wouldn't trade them for anything else.
5.0,"This item is authentic BT21!! It's super cute and the size is adjustable, which makes it perfect!! The color looks like Royal blue.  Great item!! Highly recommend it!"
5.0,My daughter loved these.  she wore them for prom and everyone kept trying to talk her out of them
5.0,It's a very cute scarf. The material is pretty thin. It's true to color. Overall a cute little scarf and great purchase for the price!
5.0,"These are the best compression socks I've found. They are thicker than some 20/30 socks, but they don't tear easily.  The only slight problem was the size chart...I ordered the medium according to shoe size, and it fit but was a little too tight at the calf top. Maybe adjustments could be put on the chart for those of us with large calves and short legs?  As for the colors they are wonderful...wide variety and cute patterns! Thanks for making an otherwise dull experience a lot more fun!"
5.0,I love it!! Fits good material is comfortable.. I order it for the ugly Christmas sweater party
5.0,daughter loved the cuppy cakes!
5.0,We loved them 😊
5.0,"I love these pants! I bought them in the green color, and while they're brighter in color than I expected, they're still so cute! They fit perfectly - I am 5'7&#34; 150lbs and I bought the medium. I saw reviews that said the side of the leg doesn't stay runched, but if you put a small loop knot in the string, it will and is easy to untie. I also wish they were easier to wash, but on the delicate setting with cold water and hang dry, it works just fine! I'm going to buy more in other colors! Love!"
5.0,"Great shirt, love the color combination!"
5.0,I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. She has the rose gold necklace while I have the black one.
5.0,"I found these on Amazon while I was just surfing.  When I showed them to my wife, she said they were so cute.  And thus we have them.<br /><br />These leg warmers are multicolored to provide many options for matching.  Each pair has a cute little animal face.  I can recognize the bear, dog, and maybe a cat.  Regardless, each face has it own set of ears, which I am informed makes them &#34;Cute!&#34;<br /><br />Our daughter is one year old who is about 28 inches tall and weighs around 18 lbs, these leg warmers go from the top of her thigh and bunch a bit by her ankles.  They slide down on her legs a bit as she moves about.  I expect this normal since they are not compression sleeves.  The package we received had both English and Chinese on it.  The English could have used one more edit, but it was readable.<br /><br />My daughters movement does not seem hindered by them as she walks about and they do not seem to hinder her when she falls and tries to get back up.<br /><br />Overall,  they look great, help keep the baby warm, and provide as access to diapers in away that pants do not.  My wife and I would buy them again."
5.0,My fiance loved this jersey!
5.0,Purchase this bag for school and work. Pockets and water bottle holder are life savers.
5.0,You should get one size bigger than your actual size.
5.0,"My husband complimented me when I wore this, and that happens rarely. Cute and easy to wear, plus pockets!! I will be using this dress for many occasions."
5.0,"It’s exactly like the picture. Larger than I was expecting. I read other reviews first, so I had a good idea of what to expect. One reviewer said it looks like a cash bag you’d use to take money to the bank. I can see that. Suited my purpose fine. I wouldn’t use it for a nice event."
5.0,She loved this set!
5.0,The perfect gift for my chicken-loving parents.
5.0,Love this cute outfit!  Can’t wait to give it to my niece for her little one.

5.0,I thought it would run small but it was true to fit!
5.0,It was great! Shimmery and flowy! Just as I expected! And stretchy!
5.0,I like the softness and fit. I bought these for my grandson. He hasn't wore them yet. These will be part of his Christmas stocking.
5.0,I love this dress. Fit perfect and the color is just as the picture
5.0,These are the best compression socks ever!  I wore these all day because I am on my feet majority of the day.  When I got home and took these socks off to my surprise my legs and feet were not sore and hurting as they usually are with other compression socks.  I could not feel an inch of pain and I felt like I had not been on my feet at all.  These are the best investment ever for your feet and legs and to keep those spider and varicose veins away.
5.0,Sized right. Seven7 wins again. Perfect fit
5.0,Love the bands and colors
5.0,To cute I love it and it was a great buy
5.0,Love the fit. Material is very comfortable. Great add to the look I wanted.
5.0,"Love these pants!!  Perfect fit. Great stretch,  soft comfy & warm!! I got the black/white checkered ones with cargo pockets. Fyi that may help with sizing I'm 5'6 weigh 157 & I got 2xl but I'm pretty sure xl would fit fine also."

5.0,Great quality jacket. Fits great.  The color is exactly what was advertised

5.0,Wonderful bag with perfectly placed pockets!  Great for all day wear at the zoo!
5.0,love the facets!
5.0,Divinely elegant
5.0,This is a cute shirt. I ordered a size XL. I am 5’7” and 205lbs. I would definitely recommend ordering a size up. It was pretty snug. One more size up and it would have been perfect. The material is almost a silky material. The quality is very nice. Just make sure to check the size prior to ordering.
5.0,Great addition to the suitcase party favor boxes. Love them.
5.0,"Soy Swarovski lover, y la verdad tengo que admitir que estos se le acercan bastante, son un poco mas pequeños, pero el brillo es el mismo"
5.0,"These socks are warm, come fairly high on my mother-in-law's calves, and best of all, have rubber grips on the sole to keep her safe.  I have no complaints.  They wash and wear very well."
5.0,"LOVE this bag! Very very classy and I am quite surprised on the volume of items it can hold!  This bag was well thought out when it comes to organization. I absolutely LOVE all the pockets and how roomy it is inside! I can pack for several days with this tote! No need for a separate toiletry bag because of the clear zippered inside pockets. Easy access to tickets, passport, money, etc!  Love the shiny black patten leather handles and the gold pull zippers. I find the bag can also be pushed in front of you besides pulling it from behind you, which I love! Very well made and can't wait to use it on an upcoming cruise! Ordering the matching suitcase...it's lovely!  Highly recommend this item."
5.0,solidly soldered and quality silicone wire
5.0,The earrings are absolutely beautiful.
5.0,I liked the way this worked although I only received one se when it said 2 that I’d receive. I was disappointed for that fact but the product worked great.
5.0,Well built product. Looks durable and elegant.
5.0,Beautiful! Perfect fit!! This is the second I buy.
5.0,Comfort. Too tight but might be due to my big head lol.
5.0,These are really great! Perfect size and shipping was quick. Great value.
5.0,Works really well
5.0,"Really nice sweatshirt with nice pockets.  I should have sized up though, it fit too small, so I had to return it."

5.0,Super quality super material
5.0,"Safely packaged for shipping, quick transit and an excellent item. Extremely pleased with everything! Thank you Earlums!"
5.0,"The most feminine and elegant larger style watch I have seen for ladies. The band sometimes comes unhooked while wearing it, but in that it doesn't come apart it doesn't actually fall off."
5.0,"I love it. The fabric is lightweight and stretchy. The zipper works easily. I ordered a 2X, which is my regular size, and it fits well. It arrived from China in one week even though the expected shipping was one month."
5.0,EXCELLENT product
5.0,These are amazing headbands!  Love the fabric and fit!
5.0,"I mean it's button. My kid likes to add some flair to her backpack because she feels like the man is holding her down with the uniform she is forced to wear everyday. If your kid has to wear a uniform and is a bit of an OG, then let them bedazzle that up with some sweet buttons, killer pins, and when they are ready, an iron-on or sewed on patch. Mind blown."
5.0,My wife loves them and says they are very cushioning on her feet.
5.0,Great price for a spare set. I love that these are so light and don't leave a depression on either side of my nose after wearing for a while.
5.0,"Great apron. I like the color and durability. My toddler likes to run around the yard a lot and he is quick. I wear the apron to hold my phone, any acorns or walnuts that he finds, maybe go grab the mail, etc. Works well when I don't have pockets!"
5.0,"I'm obsessed with this bag already, it's perfect for concerts and outdoor events. I can't believe how much fits in there with the zipper expanded! My ID holder, keys, gum, hand sanitizer, eyedrops, sunglasses, a small cooling towel and iPhone XR all fit nicely. Def recommend for low key events that don't require you to be formal, but need to carry more than your pockets will handle."
5.0,huge difference in quality and weight vs nxt pod pack
5.0,"bought this for my husband. They fit him well, washes well. will purchase again."
5.0,Loved the colors and very comfortable.
5.0,I love it. it really does the job thank you
5.0,These shoes are decently made for the price and my High Functioning picky child absolutely loves them! They don't pinch nor does the tongue bunch up like other high tops. the Velcro is definitely kid friendly too!

5.0,"Such an adorable although a bit pricey it's worth every penny.<br /><br />The fit of the hat is amazing and there are so many small details that are just adorable like Tata's signature under the brim, the steel buckle at the edge and all the embroidery. My favorite B21 product by far."
5.0,"I love this dress, it looks exactly like the picture. I am 5'8&#34; 145lbs and I bought a medium."
5.0,BEST SWIMSUIT FOR PRICE!!!
5.0,soft material that also wicks the sweat without getting too saggy

5.0,Perfect fit. They don't curl up or move around in my shoe. The first no show sock I've loved.
5.0,Perfect semi-casual work dress
5.0,This is such a quality made SACK-PACK and the material it's made out of is great.  There is a small zippered compartment inside that will keep<br />keys and small objects from landing in the bottom of the pack.  I am very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"I have to say, I've wanted a pair of these since I was in middle school, and I always put getting them off. But I decided to get them as a Christmas present for me, and I love them already. The print isn't going to peel or wear off. The only two things that bother me are that there was a little tag in the right one that was annoying me, but that was easy enough to snip out. The other thing is that there's a little seam around the thumb that's pretty big. I'm sure as I wear them more and they get 'broken in' a bit, they'll be just fine. Overall though 10/10!"
5.0,Very pleased with the fit and quality
5.0,"Very nice, better then thought for the price."

5.0,"Does not keep feet warm, but works great other wise."
5.0,The charm was used on a pandora bracelet and we were happy the disney collection was available with mickey and minnie. The charm fit perfectly and the color matched the bracelet!
5.0,"I'he only worn it a couple of times, but received a number of compliments. I wear black to work a lot and this scarf adds a touch of floral femininity.  The dash of red provides a dash of color near your face, which every woman knows is complementary."
5.0,I like it fits perfect! everyone loved it!
5.0,"The band works as described. You MUST remove the white piece after you remove the screws. If this is the first time you’ve had to replace that band the white cover will be hard to get off it will come off with a a little force. Put your fingernail right under the edge and then slowly wiggle. Once you get enough room to get more then a fingernail under, give it a good push and it will snap right off. Again, will need some force to come off but it will."
5.0,It's perfect!
5.0,Fit my petite daughter prefect. She looked cute and curvy.
5.0,"I have worn these for the past 2 years (nearly to death, might I add). So cute, I get compliments when I wear them."

5.0,Great compression socks for the price. These fit and work well and alleviated a lot of my leg and foot pain that I experience at the end of a 13-hour shift working as an RN. Definitely on the tighter end of different compression socks that I have tried.
5.0,my husband loves these
5.0,Una sola palabra !! Hermoso!!!
5.0,"Great material, fits the size as stated (L). I was a size 12 and im down to size 10 now.  Not see through. It doesn't snug off while doing yoga or squats."

5.0,sick but low qualtiy
5.0,Awesome bra. Pushes up the girls quite nicely. Very comfortable and pretty. Loves the front open style.
5.0,A double layer near nose and mouth. Fits well and adjusts nicely.
5.0,For the price I payed for this Is a steal. It is authentic and  the quality is superb. I really was impressed. Not cheap looking at all. Only problem for me as always was I'm so short I needed to alter the sleeves and of course the hem
5.0,"This dress surpassed all expectations! I was looking for a nice floor length dress with embroidery, and this is a great dress for the price! It's really beautiful and unique, and the embroidery is very well done. I feel like it looks expensive, and I could see this dress hanging in Anthropologie or other stores like that. This dress would be gorgeous at any formal event, and it is certainly very eye-catching. I didn't really like the half sheer part at the bottom so I got a navy blue maxi dress to wear underneath it.  The dark blue under really makes the embroidery stand out. I do like the nude colored slip dress that comes with it and I'll wear it under other short dresses."
5.0,Buen tela
5.0,"This bag is awesome! Been looking for the right bag for years! Have finally found it! I purchased the tan and will be purchasing the black as well.<br />Two main zippered compartments which I need. One for the usual, one for papers, envelopes, bills, etc. One Outside back zipper Pocket for loose change, receipts, etc. 1 Inside back zipper pocket for makeup, lipstick, etc. Two inside front open pockets for cell phone and keys. Would love to have in all colors. Double handles are perfect length for carrying on shoulder. Keeps its shape while being soft and flexible. Nice size. I like a bigger size purse but don't want luggage. This bag is perfect! :0)"
5.0,"I bought this for my small chested friend for a pirate fest. It was amazing. If fit perfect, the strings in the back were adjustable to 2 different sections of the back which made it easier to make tighter for the top section and loose on bottom. Wore it for 10 hours with no problems"
5.0,Very soft and super comfy
5.0,So awesome.  A couple no of months ago I had to start walking with a walker.  This bag is perfect for when I want to get groceries.

5.0,Great watch for the money. I  bought this watch twice
5.0,"The gloves came in quickly and are just lovely! The only issue was I ordered a medium (what my old pair of gloves were) and while I could get my hand in the glove, it was very snug. Not the makers fault, I should have double checked the dimensions. Still would recommend, just if in doubt, go up a size."
5.0,the color is beautiful!
5.0,my son loves the way it fits
5.0,"Great bonnet. Used it for my waist length boho braids and box braids.... Elastic is strong and the bonnet stays on the entire night. Great for wild sleepers. It’s cute too, color is true to the photo."

5.0,"Bought these bike shorts for my husband because they look Like regular shorts instead of tight fitting bike shorts which he really liked. The shorts fit him really well and look great on unfortunally though we have not been on our bike since he got them because it has been raining everyday so as soon as he does his first bike ride wearing them I will do another review on them, but so far they sure look great!!!"
5.0,Better than VS
5.0,"Have 2 sets for myself; these were a gift for a friend. She is delighted with them. They carry so much, making for fewer trips for loading and unloading, plus, they are pretty."
5.0,Good for de manny
5.0,"These earrings are so BEAUTIFUL..to be honest they look different from the picture shown.....(darker brown feathers, bronze gems that hang ...an antique feel. I LOVE THEM : )"
5.0,"LOVE! I usually wear 12-14? I bought large and so happy. I judged size by all the reviews...so, need my Spanx to smooth out a few areas LOL but have a feeling I will wear over and over. Fabric feels great and its a pull over so no zippers to wrestle with. Very happy"
5.0,"Very comfortable, my son loved them."
5.0,Nice large cloth.  Just what I was hoping for.  Interior cleaning cloth and outside polishing cloth.
5.0,"Absolutely my most favorite bathing suit I've ever owned! I've never been confidence in a swimsuit because of having weight in my stomach, but this high-waisted swimsuit hugs me in all the right places. I get compliments every time I wear it. The materials is great as well, very well-made. Honestly had no problem!  Fits great!"
5.0,Very very beautiful. My three years old daughter adores them. And everyone is complementing her all the time about her earrings.<br />For me was very important that the back of the earring is covered and it doesn’t bother her when she sleeps.
5.0,I used these for my Max (Sam & Max: Freelance Police) costume. They look fantastic! Took a couple tries to fit them right but it was worth it. Now I'm set for any costume that needs sharp pointy teeth!
5.0,My husband loves it for work
5.0,This ones my favorite one!
5.0,I love these compression socks they fit great wear well.  They don't cut your legs like some compression socks I would get them again.
5.0,Simply Fantastic!
5.0,This is a small but visible pendant with a sterling silver chain. It was packaged with the chain in a separate compartment inside the plastic bag to keep it from scratching the pendant. There are five blue diamonds and five white diamonds. I will wear over a white or light colored top to show it off properly.
5.0,Fit well. Appear to be very sturdy. Happy with them so far
5.0,My daughter wore for her birthday weekend. It was exactly what she wanted and it made her feel extra special. Thank you!
5.0,"I was skeptical.... I had never ordered a costume like this and was sure that I would have to return it since I'm shaped thicker at the bottom and didn't know how men sizes would fit on my body. To my surprise, this costume fits like a glove! I am 5'5&#34;, pear-shaped, and 140 lbs--- it fit over my larger calves and thighs without any struggle! Even the arm and calf bands fit perfectly! Of course, the mask was the icing on the cake! I am so excited to show off my killer costume this Halloween =D"
5.0,These are my new go to socks. I’m a men’s size 9 so I got the large and they fit great. This is my second order as I have switched all my socks over to the zealwoods. These socks keep your feet comfortable throughout the day and almost feel like a second skin.
5.0,"Love this bracelet. I have an average wrist and it’s a bit on the large side, so be aware of that. Otherwise, well made and beautiful."
5.0,"A lot of people keep saying the made in China and the company name is too big, but if you fold the bandana like the picture it is completely hidden.<br /><br />The design is only on one side, but again, if you fold it no one notices. I wear mine almost exactly like the picture or where I cover the top of my hair more like a Do rag thing and it works great. I would get another one in a different color. :)"
5.0,"I LOVE these boots! Every morning I go out to my garden, my sneakers usually end up soaked by the time I get back inside. I needed boots. Ordered these and when they came, I fell in love!!! They’re so comfortable and keep my feet dry. They’re also super cute! Really happy with them!!"
5.0,Really love it. I needed one that would hold all my cards w extra pockets or space for cards that were not credit cards.  Plus I wanted a few windows for my picture id's. Perfect but must admit a little fat w all my stuff packed in it. I received it quickly & it's good quality.  I would recommend this item to other shoppers.
5.0,Perfect fit for my son's AFO's!  He's 5 years old and these socks works the best for this AFO's and shoes.
5.0,"This was a gift and the giftee was pleased; although I ordered an XL and it looked more like a L. Be prepared to order a size up as if you were in the juniors section of a store -not women's. Overall, it is a cute fun find :)"
5.0,They are great socks. I like the way they fit and are nice looking. I would definitely buy these again from this seller.
5.0,I ordered this brand for 3rd times already. It's comfortable and fits perfect for me but might be small for men face.
5.0,"Got this watch just two weeks ago. Time is accurate, functions are good. No complain. But the biggest problem- when you messed it up with playing. Some how, if you try to fix it- the hand book that come with it- is just worthless. No videos - no guideline, even customer care personal can't help- unless you send them back the whole watch. I play with my edifice and messed it up and i fixed it. And I am happy. The only thing that i noticed is wave cepture - i don't know how it work in DC- But I like the watch- this is my second casio edifice watch- there is another warning do not put it near by the magnet or high electric frequency. then your watch is done. it gone forever."
5.0,So funny. We're still laughing every time we put it on.
5.0,boss loved them

5.0,"Amazing hat, much better than the one the army issues."
5.0,"Love these house slippers, very comfy"
5.0,This is the second bridesmaids dress I bought on amazon. The seller made the dress to her measurements and it is amazing. Barely a little too big all around which is ideal - better to err on too  much than too little. I’ll post photos as soon as it’s tailored properly!

5.0,Super pretty! Just like the picture .<br /> Highly recommended
5.0,I've had this hat for some time now.  I get plenty of compliments.  I don't wear it around the yard.  Mostly out shopping or at the office.  Maybe when it gets a little older I'll wear it out doing yard work.

5.0,Father daughter dance. Fit perfectly
5.0,"You don't have to be pregnant to wear these! I have been searching for compression socks for long car rides and flying to fit on my 19&#34; calf and this was the 4th pair I tried.<br /><br />LOVED.<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE! I'm buying another pair because these were perfect. There was only the tiniest bit of swelling where the fabric loosens below the ankle, but it was barely noticeable. That was after a 14 hour car ride! I wore them again on the way home with the same results.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!"
5.0,This arrived and I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and how well the 4 leaf clover is preserved.

5.0,"Fits great and my son loves the color, nice and bright...and made well too"
5.0,"This earring is beautiful! I wanted a stud earring with flare, not big, but one with presence.  These have an offset stem which i have used to my advantage by replacing the backing with a wider stabilizer and rotating the earring to a position that is centered on my lobe."
5.0,The price was the best from all comparable items. I gave these to 4 young girls in my choir.
5.0,I love it!! It looks exactly the same as advertised. Couldn't be happier. Thank you🖤
5.0,Great quality! The bell is pretty large so when I wear it it sits between my clavicles and doesn't jingle too much with just regular movements.  It's so nice I've actually worn it out in public a couple of times and I really liked how easy it was to pair with an outfit without it looking out of place.
5.0,Very comfortable! Breatheable but not see through. Falls a few inches below the knees
5.0,I’m 5’10 and hippy it fits like a glove !
5.0,"Great fit, exactly as the measures detailed. Perfect for my ballet classes during winter. Loved the fabric and the details in the sleeves."
5.0,"This is a very nice casual dress.  The material is a good weight - not thick enough to bunch up and slide up your butt when you sit down, and not thin enough to outline your underwear.  It's a bit big around the shoulders for me, but I'm thinking that will change after I launder it.  I love the feminine neckline and the drape of the skirt that hides my trunk-junk.  I feel pretty in this dress and I'm glad it's versital.  After you try it on, cut the tag out on the neck if you want to keep it.  The tag is a nasty thorn that will torture you until you kill it with a pair of scissors."
5.0,I love these! They can be used as modest cover's under v necks tshirts and tank tops. I just have to put a stitch on each side of the lace to make it modest. They're comfortable! Best that I have found yet!! A++
5.0,"I really like these, very easy to use."
5.0,Amazing 😍
5.0,"Very pleased with my second Longmire hat.  Stylish and affordable, this cap is a great addition to my hat collection!  And, I truly got into the show!  Sadly, the last season is in the can and on the tube."

5.0,This is a really cute small owl pendant that won't break the bank price wise. It was purchased for a Christmas present for an owl lover friend of mine.<br />It's well made and adorable. The 18&#34; chain is a good length and should work well for most people. Also good alternative for people who are sensitive to gold.
5.0,"I got these for my boyfriend and I and it honestly made him the happiest guy ever. I've never seen someone so happy with such a gift. It definetley hits you in the heart when you read this necklace. Its beautiful and I've had it for months now and nothing went wrong with it. I sleep with it every night and shower with it, and nothings changed. Very hard to break too, this bad boy has  been  pulled on so many things I'm suprised it hasn't broke yet. Totally worth the 20 bucks!!"
5.0,Love this key fob protector! I’ve already dropped it twice and my key fob has ZERO damage!
5.0,It is beautiful my daughter loved it. It made her birthday outfit. But it was a little to heavy she did not keep it on too long. But just long enough for her pictures. Over all it’s real nice just a little to heavy.
5.0,"It has an oversized fit, which is what I wanted."
5.0,Used for a charm bracelet.
5.0,Husband uses this.
5.0,best sweatshirts .
5.0,Bought as  gift for great grandaughter and she loves them.
5.0,Perfect bag!!! I needed a bag when I go to different clients homes as a home based educator and this was perfect and it gets pretty heavy at times and it has not frayed or broken love it.
5.0,"BUY THIS DRESS!! IT IS LOVE IN CLOTHING! I'm 5'7, 135 lbs, and a solid 34C. I usually always wear a medium, however, I up sized to a large after reading all the reviews and it fits like a DREAM. I'm not a naturally curvy girl, I have slim hips and broad shoulders, but this dress gave me such a flattering figure. Love it. Love love love."
5.0,"I am very happy to receive beautiful, soft long skirt! I need cut 7 inches for my wearing. Anyway, I like them very much! Thank you!"
5.0,I bought this for an aerial performance. I truly thought it would be in pieces by the end of it simply because I was performing on fabrics and I was so sure that the feathers would rip out. But to my surprise it lasted through both performances completely intact (minus a feather or two). The material is well made and very secure!
5.0,Very nice and it looks much more expensive
5.0,As pictured. Fast delivery.
5.0,Excellent quality belt! Accurate sizing and very well made. This belt arrived packaged inside a drawstring bag that was additionally wrapped in plastic. I would purchase again and definitely makes a nice gift!
5.0,Perfect for a convalescent.  Also perfect for anyone to use at the home dinner table if they tend to drop food on nice clean clothes ........
5.0,Great watch for the price!
5.0,"fit is true to size (i'm an 8.5 - that's what i ordered and they slip on/off with ease) - so comfortable, nice sleek look and go with jeans, khakis, ankle or crop pants, everything - if i could find this shoe in a slip-on (no laces), i would buy them in every color"
5.0,Fits great and comfortable!
5.0,Glasses fit good clear 2nd pair gotten before. Like
5.0,"Two thumbs up.  Best value and excellent product.  I have owned CEP compression socks that cost upwards of $60 a pair.  These Danish compression endurance sleeves are durable, comfortable, and cost only a fraction of the CEP.  I run marathons and do weight lifting regularly.  I wear these sleeves for long runs and dead lifts in the gym.  I'm going to buy another pair for my wife and my daughter.  Great product and fantastic value!"
5.0,"Absolutely in LOVE with these leggings. They are true to size, the perfect thickness, not see-through, flattering, and are VERY comfortable. I would definitely compare these to leggings that you would get at VS/Pink for $50+, and I honestly feel that these are even more comfortable than those. Plus, you can't beat the price of these!<br /><br />I now have the royal blue color (very bright and fun) and the black pair, but I will be buying many more in the future!"
5.0,My wife really loves the Sovelen Women's Oversized Cowl Neck Pullover Sweaters Turtleneck. In fact she's wearing it today at work. This highlights two things. It's good to wear when it's cold and it's good for a casual work environment.<br /><br />She regularly wears this sweater and looks beautiful every time she does.<br /><br />It's also really easy to care for. Wash and hang to dry.
5.0,Very nice & reasonable.  Will order again.
5.0,Love this necklace!! Good quality - same as you would expect buying a necklace from some place like Target. Looks exactly like the picture. Got compliments the first day I wore it. Arrived quicker than expected.
5.0,"Beautiful!  Light-weight, nice quality.  Bled a little with first wash but I hand-washed.  Second wash most of that went away. Big enough to use as a halter dress (I'm 5'7&#34;) and thin enough to not be bulky when knotted at the wait.  I'd buy again!"
5.0,This is absolutely adorable and well made. My daughter will be showing her uniqueness while playing softball as well as knowing her hair will not be obstructing her view. Glad I made this purchase!
5.0,"I ordered these for my 78 year old mom.  She needed help identifying her luggage and these tags are great.  Sturdy, durable and brightly colored.  Would highly recommend!!"
5.0,Material is soft. The hi low design is perfect.
5.0,"Super cute, perfect fit (as expected), made well."
5.0,I received 8 bands! What a deal!
5.0,Hold very well
5.0,This is a great buy and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it each time I have worn it. It is a little heavy but not so much that it is uncomfortable to wear and it feels solidly made. My kid's friends asked me if it was real stones! :)
5.0,"Excellent shirt, great price."
5.0,"This kit is amazing. I thought I was going to have to throw out my white leather sneakers due to heavy soiling.  They looked bad.  White shoes can be a pain and I usually end up replacing them rather than trying to clean.  I saw this kit and decided I would give it a shot.  The results were impressive and after seeing how well this worked, I used it on a bunch of other shoes. I used it on a pair of leather dress shoes and it took the staining off. It didn’t take a lot of the conditioner to get a good luster so the bottle should last me a while. It restored my dress shoes and some sneakers and made them basically look brand new again. The cloths are great too, they didn’t leave lint behind and I tossed them in the wash after. I like that there are two cloths, I use one with the cleaner and the other with the conditioner.  I have enough to last me a while.  I am going to gift this item to family after seeing how well it worked. All in all, this is a great, effective kit. I was very pleased with the results!"
5.0,These are perfect for masks. So gentle in the ears and help with the fit!
5.0,"Great leather quality, fine craftsmanship, lovely dark chocolate brown trim with black glove body. I live near Philadelphia and wore them this week."
5.0,Super cute and fit perfectly under tall boots.
5.0,"This dress was amazing! I wasnt expecting much seeing as it was $10, but I needed something for a Christmas party in 4 days and with covid there was nowhere I could really shop. But it exceeded what I thought I was going to get by far! It was so soft and fit amazing, very flowy and looked like I had spent 10 times as much. There is literally nothing bad I could say about this dress and I'm looking forward to another occasion where I can wear it again."
5.0,I bought these as a Christmas gift. When they arrived they are even better than the picture. Look and feel pretty solid and good quality. I'm seriously considering buying a pair for myself :P
5.0,Nice. Needed to take links out but it was not complicated. Receive compliments all the time.
5.0,I need light weight & soft jammies because I live in pain. Very often I can't get dressed so I'll spend the day in jammies like these.
5.0,well made and good quality
5.0,It was great for the price and pretty comfortable
5.0,"Great fit, brim is relatively firm and it keeps the sun off of my face, neck and ears."

5.0,My son loves these socks
5.0,purchased for a flapper costume and they looked great
5.0,"When I opened these and saw the uneven sole of the shoe i was sure these would not be comfortable, yet... they are. I noticed the bumps at first but not in an anoying way and then I completely forgot about them as I wore them. So I concede, they are comfortable."
5.0,Beautiful dress and at a great price. My normal size fits and the material is very comfortable.
5.0,"Love how these fit. Tight, fingers don't twist. They're super soft and flexible Great for driving or walking around outside. All around great to wear.<br />Unfortunately for my skin on the back of hands got super irritated. The inner lining is woven very tightly and this seemed to itch and crack hands. This sucks because these are great feeling gloves. Will give to someone or donate them. Hope this doesn't effect everyone, my skin is super sensitive."
5.0,I love the dress but it was too small for me. I sent it back to you and it was to be put on a gift card and I can't find the gift card with the price of the dress on it.
5.0,These were exactly what I needed.  Quality was as expected.  Shipped quickly.  I would buy again.
5.0,This makes an ordinary tshirt look stylish. I'm obsessed w/ this necklace!!!
5.0,"Super Cute and Exactly as Pictured.<br />The hat was too big for my three month old niece but It will make a awesome summer hat for next year. The colors were true to the pictures. The hat itself seems well made and the stiching is professionally done. The material feels like a thin cotton canvas. Not as thick as say uniform pants. Light enough for summer but still provides protection. Overall, I glad I picked this up and I am looking forward to taking tons summer photos with my new best friend."
5.0,Are you kidding me? These sunglasses come with everything you need and they look awesome!!! My friend thought I paid over $100 for them!
5.0,"My husband loved it, the only thing is the part you use to pull the zippers open and close broke semi quickly"
5.0,Well-made chains!
5.0,Yellow tassel perfection. True to color.  Light weight. I received so many compliments on these ear rings.
5.0,"I intend to return this item because the sleeves are a bit larger and loose for a small size (I'm 5'1 petite) but, on the second thought, I decided to keep it and give as a gift.  I have another one Red with a long front (small but diff style) that fits perfectly well.  I love the design, the texture, the soft feeling and comfortable lightweight.  Also, thinking buying more..Thumbs UP!  Five star!"
5.0,"The material is nice, soft, and thick. This is gonna pair great with jeans."
5.0,I love this mask as it says it all since no one can see my smile anymore....
5.0,"I bought this button down top to use for the first few days after surgery. The material is just what I was looking for. The size was accurate (I ordered a Medium and I am 5'2"" and 130 lbs). Fit just right."
5.0,Just as advertised.  No issues!

5.0,Love these bags. Got some for my wife and she loved them!!
5.0,"I had  receive this as a gift for Christmas and I absolutely loved it!  It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be and the chain looks like it would easily break, but pretty none the less. The chain is a bit longer then I thought as well but that's okay and could be fixed if I wanted to. Over all it is a wonderful gift!"
5.0,"I'm 5'6 185lbs and I bought a size XL, it fits perfectly. Very comfortable and doesn't ride up your back, straps are adjustable and I'm surprised how well it holds me up (40D) without a wire.  Love these bras."

5.0,Really nice earrings.  I am very impressed with them.  I have been looking for starfish earrings for a long time to match a necklace/bracelet set I have.  These are perfect.

5.0,"I am female and often order men's shirts, because I have wide shoulders from a lot of wide arm push ups.  This size/style works for me. I really like the graphic/colors. The fabric is 65%polyester 35%cotton, and does stretch. I ordered another 2 in different graphics. Heads up guys, this medium fits more like a mens small, or slim fit medium."
5.0,The slippers were a little on the small side  but they are still comfy and look awesome.
5.0,I got this as a gift for my little sister and she absolutely loves it!
5.0,This is the BEST polishing cloth I've ever used!

5.0,My husband liked and thought it gives relief.
5.0,4 year old loves this style
5.0,"My daughter wore this for Halloween, it was very cute because she matched with her friend. It fit extremely well on her as its hard to find her products that fit because she is skinny and tall."
5.0,"My girlfriend loves it! She wears it on her shirt pocket during her nursing clinicals and says she forgets its even there most of the time. She is really clumsy and it still works so pretty durable so far, was worried about the quality given the price."

5.0,Attention I get when I wear it !!!!!!!!!!@
5.0,"These were a hit at my zombie party, and I didn't have messy body paint to get all over everything all night.  I wore these gloves and painted a mask to look fleshless and had a nice, low key, no messy makeup night."
5.0,Just as expected except I should’ve looked to see what how big these were on a ruler as they were bigger than I expected! Now I am going to this store to buy some smaller ones as well!
5.0,"Bought for my grand daughter to wear while hiking at their mountain cabin.  Her mom, dad and brother have them as well."
5.0,"I have already bought several face masks and this one is by far the best. For the following reasons.  The material first is very soft.  It does have two layers so you still get a firmness overall.  AND for all you people who are really paranoid, yes, there is room for a filter.  The best part I think for me is, I really have a smaller face than most adults.  And usually the adult sizes are tight for me.  this one is actually bigger than normal and has one of the easiest adjustable ends that you can easily adjust on or off of your face.<br /><br />We have to wear these and if you are looking for style, this company has alot and this one is by far my favorite."
5.0,Bought this for my 9 yr old daughter and she loves it. The material is buttery soft and the colors are so vibrant. Will be buying other colors.

5.0,The best you will ever buy!!!!!
5.0,KEPT MY LEG WARM AND PROTECTED
5.0,Sizes seem to run big. I ordered a medium which turned out to be way too big for me. The company Soomet really cooperated with me when I had to reorder a small instead. I really like the shirt and I’m sure it will give me the sun protection I need.
5.0,"Nice, stylish and thick."
5.0,Very cute. My daughter loved it. Fair for the price
5.0,"The dress is exactly as described, it fit quite well. The material is also good quality. I love it!"
5.0,The only thing I don't like is the strap
5.0,Extremely soft and comfortable.
5.0,Perfect finish to my 2 year olds 1980s Jogging halloween costume. She is now 3 and they still fit. She loves wearing them for fun!
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. Was better than the picture.
5.0,High quality leather band that was packaged with a very useful tool for band replacement.
5.0,"Only (minor) problem I have with it is that the beak is actually flat, rather than the curved portrayal the product image seemed to imply."
5.0,From all the dresses I have ordered this is the best hands down. Just be careful I ordered a dress with sleeves and they sent me short sleeves.
5.0,"Well, I was hoping these would be very similiar to the HD 790s I purchased bout a yr ago, but no LV took the best features of the 790 and did away with them in the 1080s by hiding the control buttons and battery out on the strap in some cloth pockets thusly very effectively hiding the info window also from view. Bogus........"
5.0,"These are really dark. I love them. They’re cute, classy looking, and trendy."
5.0,"Bought for my daughter to wear for a class project on the American Revolution.  For a costume/dress up, the material is good.  Feels like a cotton/polyester blend maybe, not pure polyester.  The details are good as well, stitching feels solid, the cuffs have actual layers of fabric, the bonnet and shawl are nice as well.  Having purchased many costumes for my daughter in the past, this one is worth the price.  She is 9 years old, I ordered a 10 year old size and it's a little big in the waist but the ties allow you to make it more fitted and it will fit for a long time that way.  The length is perfect, long enough to cover her ankles but doesn't quite touch the ground."
5.0,"beautiful, all of them are."
5.0,"Lightweight and warm. The material isn’t super thick, but it will definitely keep you warm. I got the XL and it fits perfectly. Not tight or too loose."
5.0,"I love this hat, it was just the right size and looks as great as the picture."
5.0,👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5.0,"I bought this watch for my sister and she loves it, very cute."
5.0,"i got a size medium and it fit perfectly! i usually have problems with bottoms fitting right on my hips, but that wasn’t a problem with this suit. the material wasn’t exactly what i was expecting - it is kind of ruched and slightly shiny, but still cute. if you have a bigger chest i recommend sizing up, because i am a B/C and it was just right for me."
5.0,It exactly as description and my granddaughter absolutely loved it
5.0,I purchased style Q in pink which I loved so much. I read reviews of these breaking but I fell asleep still wearing it and it was fine the next day. I've worn it several times with no problems. I wish the silver pieces didn't have black patches of the metal showing like chips in the paint. I'd prefer a solid silver paint but that's something I can get over.  Overal I love it and I've gotten tons of compliments from people who love it. I have a second in black I'm waiting on =)
5.0,"Get a size or two up, love it"
5.0,"These pants are amazing!!!! Love them. True to size, soft and super cute. I received so many compliments."
5.0,"I am very impressed by the quality of this hat. It fits perfectly (I have a medium sized head for a male I suppose). And it will keep your head extremely warm! Very comfortable, and I received many compliments on it. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Looks great and comfortable.
5.0,"This is a big ring, and looks great on the hand. I wear it most days, and I think it holds its own next to rings of greater cost. I like the bear claw design, and it's comfortable, provided you get the correct size."
5.0,Great quality .....better then expected!!
5.0,I love it! I always wear it as everyday but I have other different color of bracelets that I always change depend what my outfit clothes match.
5.0,"My daughter has many medical conditions that makes her medical team nervous when others aren't aware when she is away at college. Having this attached to her Apple Watch (40mm) makes her, the medical team and her parents feel way more at ease. She likes it because it is discreet compared to other alert bracelets she has used in the past. It doesn't bother her at all yet provides the added sense of security we need. Would definitely recommend to a friend!"
5.0,"Absolutely flawless, verified Cazal."
5.0,"I wanna like these so much but I have oily skin & they’ll slide 🛝 down on a chick nostril, the quality is great though too! I think it’s just me fr🙄"
5.0,Very nice dress fit will
5.0,"I ordered this dress for my mom, item was as described ad the Apricot was a nice color."
5.0,Beautiful cap!!! Good quality!!!
5.0,these are super comfortable and stay in place
5.0,Cute top true to size . Light and stretchy material. Looks like a sweatshirt in the pictures but it is a much thinner material
5.0,"Such a beautiful dress...<br />The fabric is thick and has bold colors. Nice combination of white, black and blue. This is good for the cold season and suitable for any occasions.<br />Breathable and skin friendly.<br />True to size. I'm 5'2 118lbs, I order small and fits great.<br />Recommended: Hand and machine wash"
5.0,"This is a nice watch for the price, but they definitely skimped on the design - instead of a backlit display there’s just a crappy little light in the corner of the display that barely illuminates it. Sad, but you get what you pay for."
5.0,Light weight and fits nicely
5.0,Super cute belt for the price. Great for jazzing up summer/travel dresses
5.0,My son loves the shirts. He wears them for his work outs.  He wants more that tells me he likes the shirt.
5.0,Amazingly Beautiful
5.0,Bride loved it.  Thank you
5.0,perfect  pair of sun readers
5.0,"beautiful,perfect for me, fast shipping"
5.0,Good Product but sizing off
5.0,"Perfect! My mother loves the holidays and always wears some kind of novelty headgear. She recently had chemotherapy and has lost her hair. Our holidays were very cold this year, and this was perfect for keeping her head warm.<br /><br />Some reviews have said that this wasn't as chunky as the photos appear. I really didn't want it if it wasn't chunky, and I had every intention of sending it back. Luckily, it was exactly like the photo. The one that my mother received was extremely chunky and a great alternative to the normal red furry Santa cap."
5.0,Perfect for my wedding
5.0,Beautiful and lightweight.  I wear it everyday!
5.0,Love it! Cute & comfy! So soft too!
5.0,"Great product. Does exactly the job it's supposed to. Simple to use, low profile, effective."
5.0,"Durable material, comfortable against the skin, well fitting.  It seems to be more durable than the previous undershirts my daughter had used, time will tell after multiple washings.  But, just out of the package, it seemed to be of much higher quality and for a little less $ than what I pay for the shirts through our dr's office."
5.0,Hat fits perfectly and looks great.  The material is nice and soft as well.  Great hat.
5.0,I LOVE IT!
5.0,Fits perfect/soft & stretchy/decal is adorable and good quality.<br />Loved it so much I ordered another for my daughter-in-law 🍁
5.0,"Seems well made, not wrinkled, dress up or down. Looks good with a tank top."
5.0,"Accurate color, good velvet material, and very comfy and warm.  Pants were very long so I had to hem the bottom. Ill probably order another color because I love it so much."
5.0,"Purchased two of them. One each for my son and my husband,they both work outside. Got a two thumbs up from each of them."
5.0,Super cute and fits really good. I’m 5’8 about 138lbs and got the small. I had gotten the red 3/4 quarter length sleeve one and loved it!
5.0,For the price it was amazing! Everyone couldn't believe it when I tell them about. The cheap price makes up for the fact the stone came loose after a couple weeks of wear.
5.0,"These pants are amazing. They fit perfect,  feel awesome,  are very stretchy and will be perfect for golf. LOVE THEM"
5.0,Great fit loved it ty
5.0,6 yr old daughter loves it. Comfy and warm.
5.0,"Love this dress, and great price! Fabric has a lot of stretch, wish there was an XS so I could have sized down."
5.0,"Tried this on quick and cannot believe how amazing it fits!  It’s not too low cut, not see through, it’s honestly way better than I had expected!!!"
5.0,Very comfortable and fits all face shapes. Good quality and super stylish
5.0,"These are the best sunglasses i've ever owned.  For the price, you can't beat them.  Great style and  fit perfectly over my prescription glasses."
5.0,Just what I needed. Fast delivery and good products.
5.0,I purchased these because I was tired of almost ripping out the nose ring I have with prongs when I wash my face cause the nose would continuously get infected since its only 6 months old. they are perfect and I can also wear the dark coloured ones to work without it being easily detected.
5.0,"Needed a band replacement for my Shinola watch.  Store price $200, so thought I would look elsewhere.  This Eache 20 mm stainless steel band is perfect.  Very solid construction.  Feels heavy but comfortable to wear.  Fits well on the watch face and looks great.  Multiple easy adjustments to make fine tuning for perfect fit.  Links can be removed with nicely machined screws (vs simple pins).  Very nice finish.  No hair pulling.  Locking mechanism well designed.  Even the tools supplied are nicely made, and very helpful.  Would have been nice to get written instructions, but pretty intuitive. Also came nicely packaged.  Really excited by this exceptional find!"
5.0,This really worked out great for my 8 year olds play.  She loved it and wasnt overwhelmed with a head to toe costume.
5.0,"This dress is beautiful and modest. It fits perfectly and falls right above my knee. I am 5'4&#34; and 120lbs, medium busted, and ordered a S."

5.0,Great look for the great price! I had to order my sisters one too! Rose gold is just beautiful! Love it!
5.0,Very versatile. Wear with jeans or casual clothes
5.0,"I live in a place where Halloween is huge. So, of course, I wanted to go above and beyond for it. And this pendant was fantastic.<br /><br />I was Bastet (Egyptian cat goddess) for Halloween, but my problem was that I didn't have a scarab necklace that she's usually seen having around her neck. So I took my problem here and found the perfect one.<br /><br />The scarab is a good size and, like the product title says, it's made of pewter. The cord it came on had to be sacrificed to make it more ornate (with glass beads) and I was saddened that I had to cut the leather cord. The cord has a beautiful knot that allows it to adjust to the size you want it. Honestly, the cord is nice, but rather plain. It clashed terribly against my costume.<br /><br />Now I know I said I wore it solely for Halloween, but it is a great necklace for whenever you want it. I wear mine when I'm out and about. The pewter shines nicely when sunlight hits it.<br /><br />And it arrived fast. I couldn't be happier with it."
5.0,"This is such a beautiful and flattering dress. The material is gauzy and nice feeling. It lays great and slips right on with no zippers. I love the ruffle and the printed detail. It does get a bit staticky, but I used a dryer sheet on it and now it lays perfectly. I got so many compliments when I wore it."
5.0,Perfect match with some earrings I bought!  Love them!
5.0,"This dress is so pretty looks just like the picture it's very flattering and fits perfectly! I am 5'7&#34; size large. Since I am on the taller side the dress does fall right above my ankles, so def doesn't hit the floor but that is perfectly fine to me. It feels nice not rough and is made out of thick fabric. I am so pleased i will def be ordering this dress again in a different color 😊"
5.0,"My feet and calves are cold all the time, so this leg warmer takes care of the calves well and can be worn under my pants."
5.0,great for swimming and active sports
5.0,It’s a nice Quality pin!
5.0,I like them very much. Nice warm fabric and sleeves that are nice and long.  Just bought two more colors.
5.0,"Nice size, great quality!"
5.0,Awesome fit is a bit large
5.0,Excellent quality and value
5.0,"True to size - get the one with your measurements, don’t size up. This belt was a perfect addition to a dress I have! Comfortable and looks to be decent quality."
5.0,Ordered hoping I could make them work for my Oakley Crosshairs.  Couldn’t be happier!  Had to trim off an 1/8 inch from both ends (these aren’t made for the crosshairs) and the fit perfect.  They are the only ones I could find in Brown.
5.0,Wear them all the time!
5.0,"I ordered and was so excited but i guess I didn't think it out well enough! It fit a little to long and not how I wanted. The best part? I was able to get a different style and was taken care of very fast by the customer service and I'm very pleased by that! The corset it self was so beautiful, glad I was able to get the right one with out a problem."
5.0,"Good buy for the price! Have not used it yet, but planning to use it in real cold weather."
5.0,Very warm and cozy.
5.0,Fits great & does not shrink at all in the wash.
5.0,"Love Olukais always, but these are a premium selection. Love the color choices."
5.0,This item fit perfectly and is exactly as described.
5.0,Love this top—it’s the second one I’ve purchased.
5.0,"Gorgeous and well made!! Lots of detail and my daughter loves it!<br /><br />Size up,  as I’m sure this nightgown will get lots of use by your little princess and the longer she can wear it, the better!"
5.0,"I really love this shirt, it's very comfortable and really cute. Can be dressed down or up."
5.0,"The fabric is good, fits well. Totally love it! The price is reasonable and still good quality."
5.0,We bought his hat for a project at my 8 year old son's school. It was perfect.  It fit his gigantic head (so it might be large on normal heads).  It came home in his backpack (not idea) but was easy to reshape and use the next day.  Great little hat.
5.0,Love this kippa. Just a little tight
5.0,Very nice organization compartments.  Cute bag.  Not good for carry-on as it takes up a lot of space.  But good for travel in checked luggage.
5.0,"I just wanted an inexpensive watch that had military time for when I go outside of the U.S.<br />I love the simplicity and easy to read face. I have a small wrist so I’m glad it does not look out of proportion. The strap that it came with is nice too, however I did put it on a leather man multi tool and it completely matches."
5.0,Got for a gift for someone and it was beautiful and they love it
5.0,LOVE THEM!!!  Tried a pair and I won't go back to plain old reading glasses.  They're right where you need them without swinging all over like regular reading glasses on a strap or falling out of pocket every time you lean over.  Easy to take lift up for reading and drop down again after using.  Adjustable enough to fit nearly any size head - my large one or my grandson's small one (he loves to play with them).  Durable enough to last a long time even when the grandson plays with them - my first pair lasted over 1-1.2 years of daily use - and easy to keep clean.  Comfortable enough for wearing long term.  I can even leave them hanging around my neck while riding my motorcycle without worrying about losing them.  Highly recommend them to anyone who uses reading glasses while working or with an active life style.
5.0,"Bought as a gift, and it's beautiful. Looks like an expensive ring."
5.0,"Great material, that’s what we ordered!"
5.0,Nice comfortable and light weight by nice enough to dress up a little. Nice alternative to shorts in warm weather.
5.0,"I washed the hankies the day I received them.  They washed up beautifully and were very soft.  Love that they are simple and classy, they will match anything.  I gave them as gifts to a group of young ladies I work with and they were very pleased."
5.0,Infatuated with these pants definitely purchasing more so stylish and comfortable
5.0,"I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I really love this headband. I had been looking for one similar to this headband for awhile, but they were always with some super crazy pattern or didn't come in any other colors than black (although I bought it in black). This product does exactly it's made to do. It kept all my hair in place and out of my face, doesn't slip or move around, easy to put on/figure out how to use. This product is a no brain-er purchase. If you are looking for a good exercise headband, something comfortable to put your hair back with at work or just to lounge around the house with, this is your headband."
5.0,"This is a replacement strap for [[ASIN:B000GB1R8M Casio Men's DW290-1V &#34;Classic&#34; Sport Watch]], a 20+ year-old Casio with two conspicuous defects: a stiff PVC strap and a plastic buckle. I never liked the strap and I hate plastic buckles.<br /><br />Hadley Roma's replacement strap is also PVC, but it is softer and more comfortable than Casio's strap and it has a stainless steel buckle. Since an 18mm stainless steel buckle would cost at least $5, Hadley Roma's strap and buckle are fairly priced at $9.95. If you wear it every day, you will appreciate its added comfort."
5.0,Looks great on my son-in-law! Wife didn't like it on me -i don't have enough shoulders according to her 🙄
5.0,Super cute boyfriend loved getting this as just a little surprise.
5.0,"I'm planning on wearing this to my college homecoming dance.  It is already husband-approved.  Very elegant, but not ""too much."""
5.0,I just use it for everything fits so good
5.0,Ordered the shirt 2 sizes up for a loose fit. It’s beautiful. Looks really nice.
5.0,Love it!  So dainty.
5.0,Starting my second season with this umbrella and I love it. I have a small deck 10x12 so this umbrella covers almost the entire thing. Of course something this big is going to sway in the wind. Any umbrella this size dangling from a pole is going to move around in wind. I do take it down if it is going to storm and the best part is the netting! It makes it possible to sit on my deck once the hotter weather comes along with all the bugs. Since my deck is small this almost encloses the entire deck and it's awesome. Gazebos are very expensive and this is a very good alternative. My brother screwed the base into my deck so there is no concern about it tipping over. I am happy with this purchase and hope it holds up for the entire summer. Getting 2 seasons out of an umbrella is all we can expect even the high end ones I have had only lasted that long.
5.0,One of the best masks I’ve bought. Size is perfect and it’s very breathable!!
5.0,This dress is awesome and the colors are amazing.  Love wearing it and get lots of compliments.  So soft. Love it.

5.0,Wore ot to work. Everyone loved it. Wears as expected.
5.0,"It fits well and is super easy to get off and on. I have bigger wrists and it still fits me, its comfortable during workouts as well."
5.0,I thought it was shorts under it but its ok that there isn't. Overall good quality.
5.0,Thank you for this i love ❤️ it
5.0,"It might be a prop, but I think it's fun, and I use it when cooking. I haven't spilled anything major on it, so I can't speak for the ease of cleaning, as I haven't had to clean it yet.<br />But I've had it for over a year and it has held up well with monthly use."
5.0,Jewelry that doesn't break the bank but looks like it should!
5.0,I didn't realize there were 2 belts until I got them ha! Better price than I realized! Exactly what I was looking for
5.0,awesome tons of colors.

5.0,My wife loves them. Great gift.
5.0,"Perfect,  cute and dainty."
5.0,I bought this sweatshirt for my 6 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it! It is a really cute sweatshirt and good quality.
5.0,These are super cute but very fragile. I purchased for my niece because she wanted her ears pierced more then just the one normal piercing and I feel she is to young. They are lightweight and pretty. However they can bend easy and break.
5.0,"I love this swimsuit. I’m mid sized and I thought it would look awful on my but it really compliments my body. Kind of difficult to put on, would recommend planning on a second person being able to help you."
5.0,I wore the heart shaped on the new shoes I bought to use for my step son’s wedding. It made my shoes look so elegant and sparkling!
5.0,My hubby love these socks!!! Great buy
5.0,Has held up pretty good so far. Bag looks just like the photo. I love the big pocket in the front.
5.0,This was nicer than we thought. We bought it for my husband to use at the gym and its just the right size
5.0,Love it. Looks very cute. Good quality
5.0,I love this but had to return the large and the medium as they were both too big. I ordered a small and will update on fit. I know it is supposed to fit loose and flowy but I couldn't even keep it on my shoulders.
5.0,My son likes it.Seals good for him.
5.0,I love the color. How much space there is to put my daughters things in there.
5.0,I love these earrings.  They are beautiful and are as pictured.  Great quality for the price.
5.0,Lite weight fabric.. be sure to order big
5.0,Very cute and nice pric

5.0,"It's a gift for my niece, she is going to love it. It's just what I ordered and it arrived on as promised."
5.0,Exactly what I needed to fill in the gap above my boots and keep the snow from getting in.  Thanks!

5.0,They do the job very well.  Comfortable!
5.0,Lots of colors&prints. Curved&straight barbells. True to gauge.
5.0,Perfect fit for g2 watch easy to change great color
5.0,Love them!!! Great price and great quality!!
5.0,Fantastic! Great fit!
5.0,"I love this dress. It's flattering,  especially with a belt. The fabric is sleek and nice,  the seams and over all finish of the dress is professional.  I had to iron it because no amount of steam or washing could get the crazy wrinkles out but it shouldn't need ironed again."
5.0,"not only soft and comfortable but my hair was finally frizz-free, tangle-free, and wake-up-ready-to-go! (i do have a smaller head and mid-back hair so the cap fit just right on me, but i could see that for larger heads or lots of hair, this may be too snug)"
5.0,It had me at pockets!!
5.0,"very pretty, good weight for initial pendants to hang from any of the rings, pretty color, clip bale is large enough to fit almost any choker and is ornate within itself. I would recommend this for any age.  can be worn alone or with small pendants- pretty either way."
5.0,This dress is well made and extremely flattering. It was nice enough to wear to my sons wedding! I got so many compliments! So worth it!
5.0,This has worked really well for me with just cleaning a ring that I cherish that has been handed down to me. It gets a lot of soap type of dirt on the underside of the ring with the diamonds. I let it soak a few minutes then clean with the brush it comes with and rinse with warm water/dry. I like that this is a natural cleaner - that was my main draw in purchasing it. I don't want chemicals on my hands when trying to clean jewelry when there are natural options such as this one. I also clean a diamond chip bracelet with it and it does a great job with that as well.
5.0,Great comfort
5.0,Love the fit. Great quality fabric.
5.0,"Love this top, I have 7 in all different colors and patterns! Long enuff to wear with leggings. Perfect."
5.0,I loved these they are the best I wish I can order them in my size and the colors are nice
5.0,Super Cute Ring❤️ & Great Fit!
5.0,Very nice looking sun glasses
5.0,Very pretty and not cheaply made. Just keep in mind that it does run very small. Look at their size chart. You won't be disappointed.
5.0,"I love this dress...the fit is great, but the bottom of the dress is just a little stiff but it's definitely a keeper"
5.0,I've had this for well over a year now and it's still in really good condition. Great pouch for school.
5.0,"Classy, great quality and nice fit.<br />I recommend purchase."
5.0,"The hoodies run a bit big, but that's Ok with me :). It will work for my cosplay just as well as a smaller one. (It's better if it's a bit bigger size than me than a bit smaller size than me.)"
5.0,My 96 year old mother's hands are always freezing even though she is always indoors.  This muff is perfect for her!
5.0,"Comfy. I'm 5'10 130 lbs. I got smalls, they fit great. My cock and balls sit nicely in these briefs. Not quite as snug fitting as the other Penguin trunk briefs. There's no fly. I get terrific range of motion with no hang up, as with all of the Penguin trunk briefs. 5 stars for quality. It says China on the label but I won't hate. We live in the world. China is part of the world."
5.0,Great quality for the price. My daughter is 20 months and it fit her perfectly!
5.0,Consider this watch to be excellent value. The fold over clasp is not the quality of the 9937 but is acceptable.<br />The japanese movement does not sweep the second hand as smoothly as the swiss movement but it is still a beautiful automatic movement. The date magnification is excellent. A beautiful time piece. Hard not to be impressed for the money.
5.0,Fits fabulous love it
5.0,"Great price for a superior product.  I will buy them again as I am sure to leave them behind like so many pair before them, lol.<br /><br />Thank you!"
5.0,I love how light weight the hat is. It keeps me cool on 95° weather and I receive several compliments.  Definitely my go-to summer hat.
5.0,as usual . beautiful
5.0,I love this bra. I have never before found a wireless bra that provides such great support and lift. It is a bit tight. I ordered the 36 C and had to absolutely use the extension piece that came with it. This was my first time using an add on extension piece but it seemed fine just a little harder to unclasp. The bra is pretty and provides great lift and cleavage without being to obvious. Love that it has no underwire.
5.0,Fast delivery and great product
5.0,Love it!  Love my Heels!
5.0,The shirt fit perfect. It look just like the picture.
5.0,I  loved it
5.0,"I got this for my mother after it caught her eye.<br />I love blue, and she liked everything about it.<br />After it came in, I havent seen a day go by where she isnt wearing it!<br />She absolutely loves this watch!!<br />I do as well. Its very sleek, stylish, and fashionable.<br />The build quality seems really nice, and I've asked if shes had any complaints and so far absolutely nothing!<br />It seems a little on the 'fancier' side, style-wise, but even with just blue jeans and a white top it matched her outfit well and brought it up a notch or two!<br />We're both super happy with this watch!"
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous. Love it!
5.0,"Runs a little big, but super cute and good quality."
5.0,I bought this for a gift.  I loved it and so did the receiver.
5.0,Excelente compra muy buena calidad
5.0,Absolutely one of my favorite purchases on Amazon. Couldn't be more pleased!!
5.0,I love the fine gauge cotton so it doesn’t snag as easily. It is soft but durable feeling. The long length is perfect. And of course white goes with most anything. It just is a quality sweater for casual wear.
5.0,I bought these for a ring toss game for my Grandsons Pirate themed birthday party<br />they were perfect and was shipped very quickly.<br /><br />I attached a photo of the inside of one and a photo of a ring toss game<br />the kids loved it
5.0,"Comfy, kick-a**, stylish boots!  Great for dressing up (business casual) and down.  Very well made and reasonably priced compared to many boots that I looked at.  I wear them all the time!"
5.0,Great glasses! I got the red pair and they can really make an outfit pop. Super cute! Definitely will be purchasing more sunnies from SOJOS
5.0,My daughter does pageants and we love Tip Top Kids shoes! They are perfect and hold up so well. These would also be cute for an special occasion outfit as well! Will definitely be ordering Tip Top Kids shoes from here again. Great price! Great quality! Quick shipping!
5.0,"I purchased a medium which is normally my size I’m a little top heavy and the dress stretches. I wouldn’t  size up as its flows and you may end up looking too big there’s plenty of stretch in this dress. The pattern is beautiful. This dress is work appropriate in my opinion nothing’s popping out or showing, also there’s pockets which I love!"
5.0,I like it but it’s a little snug. It’s very fashionable.
5.0,I like this cotton nightgown - it's comfy.
5.0,"I generally do not write reviews. However, for this display case, I find I must. It is absolutely beautiful to add your keepsakes within. It was packaged, shipped, and received in the most secure way I have ever received a box, bag or package. Seller: Display Gift Inc. letter perfect in your care of service and I totally appreciated that. Mine holds the WWII CAF RedTail Squadron Cap and Pin. To ALL of the men and women of color who fought and died in ALL of our nation's wars , I salute you all and thank you for your service to these United States of America."
5.0,"These glasses are lightly tinted and great driving sunglasses. They're not too dark so you are able to see inside your vehicle while driving. Great for bright, overcast days or evenings when you still want some sunglasses on for protection."
5.0,Love this cute little necklace. Perfect size and not cheaply maid.
5.0,It works great
5.0,AWESOME QUARTZ WATCH WITH WORKING SUB DIALS FOR DAY AND MONTH ALSO FEATURES A MOON PHASE DIAL....i RESIZED IT MYSELF AND LOOKS EXPENSIVE AND HAS A GOOD FEEL...PERFECT GOLD WATCH FOR MY RETIRED AGE :)<br />YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH IT.....

5.0,"With all the craziness of the Elf on the Shelf, this was a great chuckle  The book that came with it explains it all!  Great gift."
5.0,"These are fantastic socks! I feared they would be too big for my toddler (he wears size 5.5) but fit him perfectly. Everything’s good about them - good grip, quality, they don’t roll off his feet. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Perfect size. Added to mini flashlight key ring
5.0,love the size and shape
5.0,Nice Dory pijama.
5.0,"I received the Bracelet and was nicely surprised! It is exactly as pictured and the fact that it is fully adjustable is awesome. It has some weight, but it makes it stand out. For the price it is totally worth buying, I'm thinking about buying some of the other designs, quality product and nice price!"
5.0,"So cute! Comes with socks and a Santa hat! Socks are perfect, hat is a little small but what a nice surprise to have included in the package. For the $ spent, you’re getting a great deal. Very generous."
5.0,"I bought these for going supermarket. It is good for eye protection from virus, flying objects and splashing stuff. Great quality, no vent, great price, and they fit around my glasses well! The strap is really nice too. They did not fog. Comfort level is good and excellent! Satisfied to date! Hope this was helpful."
5.0,"Got them yesterday and they are working as discrbe.  I did not have to touch my glasses at all.  They stayed right in place.  No need for nose pads, or a strap around the back of your head.  Perfect for the issues with glasses sliding down your nose."
5.0,A very nice top!
5.0,This dress fits perfect. Makes me look like I have an hourglass figure. I’m tall and have no hips. Very flattering. But can tell it’s cheap up close
5.0,Sturdy and does everything it claims. Love the world time functions and it looks great. Highly recommend although it is a little pricey
5.0,"This hat is fabulous. I will be wearing it every time I go to the beach. Yes, it does come folded for delivery, but the shape is so easy to put back it definitely does not stay wrinkled and misshapen. I will probably be ordering the other colors as well!"
5.0,They are so unique everybody compliments me whenever I wear it! Great buy for good price!
5.0,Love the versatility of these leggings! Pair with anything dress up or down as required…might consider hand wash cuz it does attract lint
5.0,This shirt was a hit...bought to for my BF for a Valentine's Day gift...he immediately changed into it and out the door we went...he even got a couple compliments on it when shopping at the mall
5.0,Inspite of them being just a bit snug they are great.
5.0,These are pretty and delicate and seem to be of good quality. They are not of a length that is highly noticeable but are more subtle than that. But they are perfect and will go with anything. I highly recommend these!
5.0,very warm for going out in the snow we get in Nebraska.
5.0,The waist is adjustable with a drawstring and they are really soft.
5.0,"I am 5'9"" 150 pounds and ordered a Large dress. I am always worried with dress length and this dress did not let me down. I felt comfortably covered and it fit snug in all the right places comfortably. Great dress I will be getting it again if I need a different color."
5.0,Love the robe will order again
5.0,"I needed white gold earrings for my wife to match a white gold necklace,  These earrings fit the bill very well."
5.0,"Nice bag, I love it!"
5.0,My local cobbler has adjusted my left shoe size in all of my winter boots but even high-quality sandals rarely have a sole substantial enough to do this. This company is the ONLY one I have found in internet-land that offers sandals with this adjustment. They're just glorified flip-flops but make a world of difference for back pain and other problems with my uneven legs. Highly recommend and hope that this company expands its sandal styles to different colors and designs.
5.0,Highly recommend! High quality for only $10!!! Would have expected lulu to have similar quality!
5.0,"These are pretty, silky and feminine panties.  Their colorful pastels are attractive.  As another reviewer commented they are a very good choice for men who enjoy wearing smooth and comfortable women's attire.  I feel sorry for all those males that limit themselves to wearing unattractive and uncomfortable boxers or briefs.  These sateen panties are as liberating as they are comfortable."
5.0,Nice and soft material. An improvement on basic sweats. Great price.
5.0,This is a very cute scarf.  It seems to be a regular size it is also pretty thick so it was great for winter time. I probably would not wear it as a fashion scarf during the summer but during fall or winter it is perfect.
5.0,Very pretty. Love the fit.
5.0,Liked the watch
5.0,"Cute design, beautiful and suitable! I can wear it with everything!!"
5.0,Im really enjoying this hat. Warm enough to wear everyday. It's soft and comfy. The only issue I have is the fit. I was expecting more of a slouchy fit. I do have a large head and find most beany hats fit me small. If you have a small head your experience may be different.
5.0,I will for sure order this item again
5.0,"Cute Navy top/dress.  I wore this with leggings.  Fits great except it's a little tight around the neck for me, but it's stretchy so it's not bad. Washed it in a zipper bag in the washer and hung it to dry.  Doesn't even need ironing - love that."
5.0,This gaiters face mask is a great purchase and very important for the times we are living through with the COVID It is lightweight very easy to breath through so you dont feel smothered It stretches easy over your head and is not too tight around your neck

5.0,"I just bought my second color in this dress!  Originally bought the navy/white striped & got hair dye on it that wouldn't come out, so had to get rid of it :(  Just bought the purple one and cannot wait to wear it!  I am 5'2&#34; and wear an XL, true to size and is only a kersmidge too long for me, so I end up tying on the side."
5.0,"worked like supposed to, chest, back, shoulders did not get burned and did not have to put sunblock on in those areas"
5.0,Love the size...not a carry on but a good size check back.  Very durable
5.0,"This was a guift for our preteen, she loves it and wears it almost everyday. All her friends asked were to get one."
5.0,"Very cute to wear for a casual day, It isn't as long as in the picture tho, I was hoping it would cover my back end in my leggings. No Go, but still cute."
5.0,"Best tanks I have ever bought, they stretch well, size is true to chart, and they are very comfortable, I will be buying more 👍👍👍"
5.0,My mother in law is a huge fan of Betty Boop so obviously we got her this tote bag for Mother’s Day and of course she absolutely loved it!
5.0,"Wow! This dress if perfect!  Size Small  5'5' 120lbs. Everyone said it was amazing.  The fit was form fitting and wonderful! Everyone said they would have never picked the color combo,  Thanks!!"
5.0,The tie back makes the top very adjustable to your size. Colors are very vibrant with no fading.  Bottoms were lined. I have had this suit for over a year with our pool and its held up very well. I still get lots of compliments on it!
5.0,"got an xs and it fit perfect I am on the thin side and 5'3""...it falls a few inches above my knees and is true to the colors in the picture."
5.0,"I bought these for our 40th high school class reunion. They are great quality, and the red ones are a great color. True red. We took a group picture with everyone wearing the classes, and it was awesome! A bunch of old people in red sunglasses 😎"
5.0,"Great fit, great style, super comfortable."
5.0,One of the best looking hats
5.0,This hat is great quality -  better than expected!  I added studs and a few Halloween decorations and received so many compliments.  Its large enough for a man or woman to wear.  Nice and sturdy - I'm sure I'll have this for years to come.
5.0,Allkem company is very kind and understanding. Thank you.
5.0,"I like the keychain, but what I got was not rubber as it says."
5.0,Love this hat! I've been wearing it daily since I got it. Keeps the sun off my face and neck and is easy to adjust the size.
5.0,"Took a little longer to get here, but fit as expected, packaged well and he looks darn adorable in it!"
5.0,These flip-flops are very comfortable.
5.0,"A substantial cotton t-shirt type knitted material was used for this top, so it's not flimsy. It is warm and sturdy. The upper sleeve is a bit snug, but tolerable. I am 5'2&#34;, and currently wear a size 18 (sigh) and this fits well. I am short, so this hits me mid-thigh. If I was a more courageous woman, or had slimmer legs or a waist, I could belt this and wear tights, and wear this as a dress. I may wear this with leggings some day, when I am feeling brave. If you work in a cold office, this will keep you warm. I haven't washed this yet, so I can't say how that will turn out. The laundry directions state no dryer, so let's see how this line-dries. Will it be wrinkled from the washer? I don't know. I would recommend this to a friend."
5.0,Awesome & convenient.
5.0,"I originally emailed company to confirm the colors I wanted. (Like another reviewer said, make sure you include tie numbers so you get the colors you want.)<br /><br />Initially, they sent the wrong batch to me, but after emailing them a second time, they sent me a prepaid envelop to return the wrong ties and sent the correct ties as well.<br /><br />They treated me as a valued customer. I would buy from this company again."
5.0,"This is for a gift, got one for each sister. I saw a model on TV with a person showing the different ways this can be worn plus the added warmth around the neck and shoulders.  You can put over your coat for added color but most are worn over sweaters.  The plaids seems to be popular this year.  I didn't splurge and get one for myself."
5.0,Perfect fit and comfortable and I don't feel silly wearing them to the grocery store!
5.0,Fits nicely and doesn’t cling to you!
5.0,I was looking for a spiral that had an artistic/almost primitive feel-and this fit the bill-- very nice
5.0,Great Product!!!
5.0,Shines silver quickly. I'll buy more.
5.0,"This stiletto has me so many times in my sewing products. When you get cornered in tight spots this tool comes to the rescue! Highly recommend, love the feel in holding while working on projects."
5.0,"I really love these pants,  They fit me so good and the length is perfect I ordered petite.<br />They wash really good and hold their shape,<br />Won't buy anything else except these pants.  I also bought the capris which were also really good."
5.0,I really love it! I will be Suit for a wedding.
5.0,"I wanted a nice white bag. This one suited me in size, color and price. It arrived promptly.<br />I was NOT pleased with the condition the bag arrived in. It was in pristine condition except for<br />looking as though it had been smashed flat. Because of the construction of the bag the outside<br />corners were crushed in. I was able to reshape the bag and will keep it."
5.0,"This is a cool Creature mask painted in colors that remind me of the Basil Gogos' covers from Famous Monsters magazine. The latex is a little thin but for the price, I cannot complain. Looks great in my mask collection.  I enjoyed it so much that I also bought the other creature version."

5.0,Very sexy I will be purchasing more in different colors
5.0,"I got this as a Christmas present for my good friend who is a fellow Potterhead. She loves it! The craftsmanship is good, and the locks include the little &#34;Muggle Worthy&#34; tag which is adorable. It has a chain so that she could wear it as a purse, but for now she's just been putting it inside a larger purse. She's very happy with it, and I want one too!"
5.0,Love it and how it was packaged the extra gift was icing on the cake beautiful thank you and I might order another one soon
5.0,"Fits me, mens 10 feet just fine. My friends get a laugh out of me when i wear them with sandels!"

5.0,My son loved these horns. And still wears them from Halloween!
5.0,Loved it!<br />Will be buying more!
5.0,"I absolutely adore this shirt!<br />I've ordered 2 so far, I'm diving back in to get additional colors.<br />The fit is beyond my expectations. I normally order a large in t-shirts, for a loose fit. This time, I ordered a small because they were discounted!<br />It fits perfectly! I'm 5'7, 160 lbs for reference. It isn't tight at all, nor is the length short. I would say it fits like a good quality medium t-shirt."
5.0,very nice and fit as expected
5.0,This bracelet was perfect for my friend who is absolutely obsessed with cats! I went back to buy myself one and now they're unavailable! Please bring them back I need one!

5.0,I Love it!  Waiting to order another color!
5.0,"Fits true to size , comfortable and easy to move around"
5.0,"So this dress is totally not my style at all, but I decided that I wanted to try out something different for my cousin's wedding. It is an early October wedding so I thought that the purple would be a pretty color to wear. I thought this dress would be good because it is very conservative yet still super cute. I am 5'1 120 pounds. I ordered a size small and it fits me almost perfectly. It has a little tie that goes around the waist so I was able to tighten it a bit because it felt a big baggy. Once it was tied though it looked great!! It fell to just a couple inches below my knees. The material is pretty thick but not heavy. It is really well made, no loose stitches anywhere or anything like that. I am so excited for the wedding so I can put this dress on! My little sister freaked out when I showed her, she thought it was just gorgeous. I did purchase this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. However, the discounted price did not in any way effect how I reviewed this dress. I rely a lot on reviews on amazon when making purchases so I keep my reviews honest and as helpful as possible."
5.0,"Looks great, securely hooks"

5.0,"great socks, will order again"
5.0,"This was super cute, the only problem is I ordered a large and it was too loose. I usually wear about a size 8 in women’s so I’m guessing I should have gone with a medium. I tried to re-order it and return the one that was too big but it was out of stock. I may end up buying it again once it comes in stock because it was very cute"
5.0,Love the color and material. It runs small.
5.0,"These are so cute! In fact, my daughter has them now! Loves them!"
5.0,I get SO many compliments on this.

5.0,It was used on a wedding. Both my Mother and mother in law used it for my daughter's wedding. It's exquisite for the price
5.0,I ordered a pair for my wife after our daughter broke her other pair. It was hard to find something similar with the wide sides like her old ones. But these were the close that I found and they live up to the same pair from before. Over all a good buy and I got them quick with the Prime membership.
5.0,Nice quality hat
5.0,Could not be more pleased . Many complements on this piece

5.0,"The recipient loved it although they are a tad big, either that or she is just a very tiny human."
5.0,Nicest bracelet I have purchased in a while
5.0,"I’m 140lbs and 5’5” with a very small budget as a full time, very active librarian, mom and wife. I ordered my dresses in Large and XL bc I’m small on top but I have bootay-ok! I need comfort, professionalism and still want to feel beautiful. These dresses fit all of my criteria! I am now ordering everything I can get my hands on! They arrived quickly and so neatly packaged! I’m very picky...and very much in love with HOMEYEE!"

5.0,"I was really impressed by this dress. I bought it on a whim thinking at the very least I'd wear it around the house, but I've work it out a few times now and I'm very pleased with it! The quality isn't amazing, like it is a tiny bit sheer, but for the price I was very pleasantly surprised. Bought it in black too!"
5.0,Very nice looking pendant.
5.0,I absolutely love this jacket very very comfortable very very nice looking I would recommend this jacket to anybody and everybody

It fits perfectly, and it has a super comfy thin fleece lining which makes this dress not only incredibly comfortable but also covers any imperfections. I will be buying in more colors! So happy!!!"
5.0,"My wife has worn these and here is what she says.<br /><br />""First it's so nice that you get two pairs for the price, and I plan to keep one at home and use one when visiting our daughter in another state. But the best thing of all is the comfort. These feel so nice and keep me so warm when it's a little cooler at night! The sizing is perfect, too, just right --- I usually wear a small and this small is a great fit.<br /><br />""There is a pocket. That is not usually there in a PJ and it is so useful because I can use these for lounging as well as sleeping. But here's the really good thing. On a lot of inexpensive products, they skimp on the elastic waistband and it tends to bunch up. But not this one, and then it closes with a drawstring and everything is good.<br /><br />""So definitely five stars. A lot of value and good quality of material and workmanship. Comfort and convenience too."""
5.0,I use them for flight travel to help with circulation and they are great
5.0,"The cows are a decent size, light & FUN! PLEASED!"

5.0,My husband loves his new robe!
5.0,This is an adorable dress. My daughter wears it with leggings. It washes up great.
5.0,I didn't think I would need to use this until the winter but my son's shoes were outside in a rain storm so it was a great time to test this out. I let them air dry overnight in the garage but they were still pretty soggy This dryer really got them dry and it didn't take to long. It was easy to set up and use right out of the box. I'm excited to have this for snow boots in the winter.
5.0,Fast service and looks great!
5.0,[[VIDEOID:5635f4864ea6a738529da64f52eefa44]] Just received it and it fits the watch well.

5.0,"love how water resistant this cover up is, not to mention super cute!"
5.0,"I love this dress it is perfect for southern winters I wear it with a slip and it is just the perfect weight for our winters.  I can dress it up or dress it down.  I am 5'3&quot; and 175lbs and the XL fit perfectly.  The material is a nice thickness.  I have machine washed it in a Lingerie bag with the intent of taking it out and dry flat as the label stated.  Opp! I forgot and I dryed it in the dryer, the dress came out perfect.  I have since order 2 more in the dark green and the gray."
5.0,I got the green lenses with the tortoise shell frame. Frame fits my big head wonderfully. Lenses are very &#34;punk rock&#34; I have been told. Tortoise frames are very tortoisey. Feels great wearing for king periods of time.
5.0,"Great suit! I'm 6'0 and weigh around 170, large fit perfect.<br />Incredible suit for the cost. Flexible,  comfortable, and arrived in perfect condition. About 15+ dives so far."

5.0,Picked these up for an Emoji themed party.  They were a huge hit!
5.0,Very Cozy Slippers
5.0,"I love this model. I've been using this model of watch for about 20+ years (off and on).  It's not the best looking, or stylish.  I get this model for its practicality.  I first bought this model a decade before the advent of smart-phones, and now all the features of this watch are available on any smartphone.  However, I still buy this model because I appreciate its ruggedness and water-resistance.  I'm very rough with my possessions.  I don't have the most up-to-date smartphone, so I don't have the water-resistance with it.  I usually use this model of watch for about 3-5 years before I have to replace it. Now that I think of it, maybe I buy it now because it reminds me of my more care-free college years, and I'm in my mid-50s now."
5.0,"I love these socks. The  color is perfect, comfortable, and I love the quantity."
5.0,"Great mask it’s thick, long and durable. It was a little tight at first but loosened up after using it a couple times and washing it"
5.0,Wow I love it. So comfortable and dits teuento size. Will get another color .
5.0,Just like description. Durable so far
5.0,Can you put the black color that comes with it as the picture?  I bought this thinking it was the lighter black color in the picture you show but it is actually very dark black.  This is very deceiving.  The color in picture looks alot better than the color I received. Plus the band does not have quick release on back like the rubber gear band has.<br />UPDATE:<br />They contacted me and sent me another band of my choice and also let me  keep my original band.  I am happy for them reaching out to me. If you have any problems with your band you will not have to worry.  They give excellent customer support!
5.0,Perfect for holding range finder or jackets.
5.0,Definitely a keeper! Very soft and comfortable.
5.0,"I LOVE THIS SHIRT, it's amazing, the picture is so clear and just beautiful."
5.0,Fits great easy adjusting
5.0,"I have a heel spur in my left foot, so I wear a compression sock, and I wear my shoes so I can help support it.  Therefore, I am usually I my shoes during waking hours.  I saw these and I figured this would be easier to use than to constantly tying/untying my tennis shoes.  I ordered these and patiently waited for them to arrive.<br /><br />They came in a small, sealed bag.  They are really self-explanatory, but thankfully, manual instructions were provided.  I took out my old laces, and began to put this in.  If you have shoes with eyelets like mine, it can be tedious to get the ends through them.  I had to use tweezers to put them in, but I don’t think this is a problem!  Once I got them in, I put the laces through the push tabs and cut the lace to the end of where you start to put the laces in on a shoe.  I then put the lace protector on the end and snapped in on<br />.<br />The laces have elastic in them, which makes it easy to for me to slip on/off my shoes.  You loosen the tab to put them on, and tighten when you have them on.  Walking around, I forget they are even on.  I don’t miss having to tie/untie, tripping when they come untied, or sliding off.  I will be getting these for my kids’ shoes has well.  It makes shoe wearing that much simpler!<br /><br />#ProductDiscount<br /><br />This product was provided at a discounted rate in exchange for a fair, honest, and unbiased review.

5.0,"Very comfortable and fit true to size, just what I expected"
5.0,"This pin is a gorgeous combination of colors. They look fabulous together. The pin is also very nicely rounded. The golf leaf looks quite delicate, but it’s actually very solid."
5.0,"Niceter daisy design imitation pearl double sided stud earrings is so beautifully made.  It comes in 3 unique pearl colors, purple, pink and white.  3 floral daisy is the stud portion with design of 2 black daisies and 1 white one. There are 3 ways you can wear this doubled sided earring. 1) with the daisy in the front and the pearl in the back, 2) with the pearl in the front and 3) with the daisy by itself (you just need earring stopper).  It is very comfortable and lightweight; contradictory to what it may looks like, my co worker even asked me if it is heavy.  I like how subtle it looks in the front with the daisy stud, and how bold and unique the pearl is in the back.  It can be worn dressed up and also down, very versatile.  Overall, I got a lot of compliment when wearing it to work and also out with friends.<br />I was chosen to review this product at no cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."

5.0,Heavy duty and made well
5.0,Such a fun seasonal dress.  I wore it all season long and got rave reviews every time.<br /><br />Note:  I did need to patch the dress in one small section at the waist.  So clearly not high quality craftsmanship but inexpensive and fun which is what I was looking for.<br /><br />Would buy again in a minute.
5.0,"Big Beautiful Pin!  Wow!  I was blown away.<br />Sparkle galore.  Works for that special occasion to perk up an outfit:  on hat, belt, coat, shawl,<br />clutch bag or anywhere you want to call some attention."

5.0,"These eye snugs are soft, comfortable and really block out the light.  I am going to do a lot of traveling this summer, I can't sleep with lights and noise. This product solves my issues with ear plugs and eye snugs, plus a case to pack it in my purse. I also use it on the airplane for shut eye. I highly recommend this brand."
5.0,They fit my g-fore perfectly just like the old ones.
5.0,Just right. The length is not too long which is hard to find for me. The material is comfy and not too hot.

5.0,"Was unable to get touch screen to work, however I work in extreme weather and have tried many different gloves and ways to keep my finger tips warm.

5.0,I love the color and style. Very flattering and comfortable.
5.0,They were perfect I loved them
5.0,"As advertised, even tho' they were made to go over regular glasses and I thought they would be smaller--looking at the picture. Not. I was wrong. But I think they work well."
5.0,"Simpy love this product. So comfortable to wear that even after wearing for 8 hours a day, you will not feel uncomfortable. In-fact i did not even remember i am wearing it. and does it work beautiful. You can clearly tell the difference before and after wearing it. Easily hides under clothes, so it is not visible at all.<br /><br />But remember to order at-least 3 size bigger than what the chart recommends for you. I have noticed that case with all of the belts, dont know why they make all of them so small and yet claim in the chart that smaller is perfect for you.<br />I ordered a 3xl instead of a regular large size and it fits perfect."
5.0,Super stretchy and comfortable. Runs true to size.

5.0,"Simple and professional this is a great tie clip. Not unlike many other tie clips, it clips your tie quite well :)  A great deal for the price and perfect if you want a simple clip to accent any tie."
5.0,Let me tell you about the best purchase that I have ever made on Amazon. I couldn’t believe the quality for the price!! It fits like a dream! I love the fact that it has a clear band around the shoulders part so that it stays in place and doesn’t rise up your shoulders. I wore it for a formal event and got a ton of compliments!! It’s stretchy as well. I wear a size 14 pants and ordered a large and it fit perfectly. I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone!

5.0,"I enjoy this product. There is however one sticky point, a few would scoff at. In photos where troops were seen wearing this hat, the top tip of this hat, appeared a tad bit taller. I used to imagine that they took the idea for this cap's design from the Wizard of Oz's Wicked Witch of the West's tall hat with floppy brim. I'm also known to have OCD......Thank you anyway!"
5.0,"I travel to Italy quite often. They are well known for their quality leather products, your fine leather belts are par with theirs."
5.0,dress is very nice.
5.0,Very happy with this shirt. I am in love with shirts that have thump holes. I wear a lot of leggings and like my shirts to cover my behind but don't make me look like I am wearing a potato sack. This one does all of it. It is the perfect length to cover but still form fitting. The material is very soft and well made. It is light weight and great for under a jacket or the fall.<br />Order a size down. I normally wear a small and bought an xs and it fits perfectly. Will order the other colors as well.
5.0,This band is really nice if you are active or just enjoy an elastic type of watch band

5.0,super nice :))
5.0,"I love this toe ring! I wanted a multi ring look with only one ring, particularly one that wouldn’t slip around when wearing it as my single band one did. This is it! It is comfy, doesn’t slide and I love the look of it. Highly recommend."

5.0,I bought these for my daughter.<br />They are so cute and very comfy.<br />True to size and easy to get on and off.
5.0,"In these times I thought it would be a good idea to have an RFID passport protector.  The leather is soft and makes a nice presentation.  Don't know if the RFID works, as I have not used it, but I am sure it will."

5.0,LOVE! They fit perfectly over my glasses and the color is beautiful.
5.0,"I bought this product for a reduced price for the review. Thank the seller for a quality product. Wife asked to buy a small and handy purse for her. She was very happy when I got it. Purse responded to all its requests. It has two large compartment for money and keys, although it has the keys separately, two pockets for credit cards, there is a compartment for a photo or a driver's license with a transparent window on the front side. Very good is the presence of lightning that does not lose anything from her purse. My wife is just happy."
5.0,"Loved it! I was able to pull off my Esmerelda costume with it. I was suprised just how much of my chest it covered; it looked smaller, but I was fully covered."
5.0,I'm a nurse and wanted a cute hat to wear at work. This one is bright pink with flowers and I love it! It's adjustable so it fits well and has plenty of room for all my hair.

5.0,Beautiful set. Love it.
5.0,Love this dress. Great casual dress to ware any time.
5.0,"We bought these shoes for my daughter after listening to her complain that her shoes (3 months old) were uncomfortable. On examining her shoes, the padding had mostly crumbled and fallen out. These Under Armor shoes have been loved from day one and are as comfortable now as when she got them. I think she’s an Under armor kid now."
5.0,"These are so comfortable. I am on my feet all day at work, and these socks keep my feet warm on the coldest of days, and feel great."
5.0,This bag has all the room I needed. It holds all my Steelhead gear great
5.0,"Bought this item since I only had one septum ring which was the original piece I was given when I had it pierced in January. Although when I first received it I thought I had chose the wrong gauge and was sort of bummed I decided to double check today before ordering the 14g ones. Glad I did they are the exact same size as my first ring and although it is a bit difficult to screw the pointed ends onto the ring once you change out your piercing enough it becomes pretty easy just don't fasten it too tightly or it will be extremely difficult to undo later on (which was the case with the initial piercing I was given at the tattoo shop). All the colors are super beautiful, some did come with the ends not screwed onto the ring but that wasn't an issue for me as I was going to remove them anyway to make sure they weren't fastened too tightly where I wouldn't be able to wear the jewelry. Overall the packaging is perfect and arrived on time and with no issues, amazing seller would definitely recommend. Will possibly post later on down the road to update on wear and tear of the product but I doubt that will be an issue."
5.0,Somewhat large for my daughter but it's ok she can grow into it. Serves its purpose.
5.0,Love it. Perfect size for a daily purse. Can't wait to see what comes out with the new collection.
5.0,Nice for summer wear
5.0,"I really like it very pretty love the diamonds in it but it was kinda heavy and hard to lay in unfortunately, I’ll probably only wear it on special occasions. I love it though"
5.0,"Liked the style.  We’re larger than I usually wear, but so cute kept them!"
5.0,Love this nightgown. I had purchased this brand in the past. It’s so soft and washes well. Can recommend without hesitation.
5.0,"I had no idea leg warmers were still available! I needed something to keep my legs warm, while I wore softer, non-binding socks on my feet. I've had procedures and surgery on my feet and they are very sensitive. Most socks, especially winter socks, are too binding for my sensitive feet (my shoe size is 10/10.5, although my feet aren't wide, most socks are simply not made for a woman with my shoe size), but I needed to keep my legs warm. These arrived today and I put them to the test immediately. And reader, they worked. They were even warmer and cozier than woolen socks. I'm going to order more. I am 5' 5.5"" and 120 lbs. These leg warmers fit me perfectly. They may be too tight for people with larger calves."
5.0,I got it for $20. Perfect for our FFB use at that price.

5.0,I purchased this shirt for my sister who adopted two boys (brothers) and got pregnant with another baby all at the same time.

5.0,My daughter wants to wear it every day. This is a great purchase.

5.0,In love! need many more of various colors!!
5.0,"Believe the reviews when they say “order larger size”.  I usually wear a large shirt.  I’ll order XL sweatshirts so they can be roomy.  But in this, I ordered 3XL and it’s perfect.  I’m also tall (5’10”) and it fits my long arms.  I am very happy."
5.0,I got these pins for my Kanken and they’re super cute! They’re really good quality and have been durable on my bag.
5.0,"exactly what i wanted, very comfortable!"

5.0,"This is my second time buying these socks!<br /><br />They are so warm, yet very thin and great to wear under pants.  Very good quality and they stay up on your leg.  Wash very well, do not shrink or pull.  Highly recommend!!"
5.0,This is the best fabric. Light weight & super soft. Perfect for our southern climate and great for layering.
5.0,"Nice looking ring, got it for the wife. She loves it, its comfortable and doesn't irritate her skin."
5.0,"I gave it as gift....and my boyfriend loves it! It very versatile: can be used as a everyday watch and also for special occasions.  The watch as a black mate color and it's so soft.  The down side it's the glass, you have to be careful not to strike to any hard surface by mistake, you if are that kind of person that doesn't calculate the distance of the wall and your hand..lol...it's looks like it could break it easily, it has not yet break or anything, but just in case... it was worth the money! Definitely I will buy again."
5.0,"Love the large dial (although it might be more convenient to have the numbers face the person looking at it rather than having to turn it upside down each time to see the time), love the chain length, love the easy push button opening (worried this will wear out soon with such repeated use, but time (no pun intended) will tell, love the color, easy to adjust the time, great price.  Only thing is a personal preference - would have preferred something not quite so elaborate in design but otherwise - it is great.  (Is there a way to change the battery?  Is there a battery?)"
5.0,"These are solid and stay on my face with no issues and have decent side protection.  They are one of the few full lens readers that I can find for not too much money and of those, these are the ones I'm happiest with."
5.0,Nice lightweight shirt to workout in. It can also be worn as a casual shirt. It feels good against the skin and isn’t tight or form fitting.
5.0,Super cute dress. Great fit
5.0,"Good buy, sewn well, nice fabric.  Order up a size or two if possible, runs small.  What I expected.  Good buy."
5.0,"I am 5’7 147 lbs athletic build with a bra size of 34D. I bought size medium in violet. This dress was slightly difficult to get around my bust but as soon as it was on it hugged me perfectly. This dress curves to your back side, it does not cascade down from it. I can wear this without a bra but the material is a bit sheer so I will need to buy petals. I might buy more colors."
5.0,"Amazing, perfect fit. They look perfect. Very happy."
5.0,"Would buy again! Very soft, warm and cute design."
5.0,Vuarnet are the only lenses that work for me. Loved the price!!!

5.0,Love this Jacket. Shipping was fast. The jacket fits great and feels good. It also has a detachable hoodie which is a nice touch.

5.0,"Really nice, sturdy, comfortable and looks like it will be long lasting.  The tool was an added bonus."
5.0,I prefer plastic belly button rings this one is fun and comfortable
5.0,"Love these so much I just placed an order for another pair in different pattern.  I'm short,  5'3 so I expected them to be quite long.  I rolled the band over and pulled them up a bit and they are perfect with my favorite pair of wedges.  Super soft and comfy.  I could see how if you got too small of a size they would show some imperfections or become slightly see through in the areas that they actually hug your body,  booty,  thighs etc.  I'm quite curvy and a large fits perfectly.  Can't wait to wear these on a warm summer day to an art fest,  Yay!"
5.0,Love this shirt!!!!  Wish there were more colors available.
5.0,Super cute and high quality.
5.0,High quality product at a reasonable price.  Great service!

5.0,LOOKS EVEN BETTER ON. IT'S AN ATTENTION GETTER.
5.0,I really like these socks; 88 percent cotton helps to control foot odor. and I really like that there isn't a logo on the side. Just a solid color. They are thin enough and enough elastic to not bunch up.<br />Black TSC men's quarter socks.
5.0,Great and comfortable quality
5.0,"These earrings are so pretty! They are perfect costume jewelry for a night out. I did receive them with gold trim but that if fine, they are fairly long and if you take care of them then I'm sure they will not tarnish."
5.0,"Love sea turtles and I love this ring!! So much detail. Its so pretty. It sorta looked like a heavy ring to me in the pic, but its not. Anyway, you'll love it!! Its a couple months later and I had some general questions about this ring...like can it be sized down a little..etc. Anyway, I just wanted to add how helpful and great this company is to order from and communicate with. Along with their rings that I love, I would totally recommend this company too!!"
5.0,Gret Service. Nice looking key chain
5.0,[[VIDEOID:252eb79c33b90e46717d345fb1084cb]] A nice durable laptop bag. The main compartment of the bag holds up to a 15.6 inch laptop. It has 2 outer pockets that are large enough to hold all the accessories needed to use with the laptop.

5.0,Very light weight but sturdy . It is large carries s lot but can fold down after use. I really like it
5.0,I purchased this for my 5 yr old granddaughter and she wants to wear it everyday. I purchase most of her clothing as my son is a single father. Since I shop a lot for her I am very picky about the material and have been getting a lot of garbage clothing from well know retailers at the mall. I was very impressed with this nightgown the material is amazing so soft slick and comfortable no wonder she wants to wear it all the time. It washes very well also! I highly recommend this product!!

5.0,Took some playing with to get links out and the size right but I finally got it and it looks beautiful and it comfortable!<br /><br />Will update my review after I wear it for awhile to see if it tarnishes fast!
5.0,"I have to admit I was dubious about the claims of thinness for this wallet. But this really delivers.  My previous wallet was made by Tumi, and I loved it except for its thickness.  The Bellroy wallet is 3 or 4 times thinner than the Tumi with all the same cards & cash in it.  I will be curious to see how well the Bellroy wears over time, but at this point I am truly amazed at how it delivers on its claim.  Very satisfied."
5.0,Great case! Not too big and fits everything I want to put in it. It has multiple pockets. Great travel organiser.
5.0,Great for little kids Nikes. I accidentally ordered a pair of little kids shoes with real laces. These worked perfectly as a replacement for the laces.  Size S is great for little kids 10 in Nike running shoes.<br /><br />I didn’t realize that a 2-pack means you get 4 laces total.
5.0,Great pants. I ordered the reg. Length and needed the ankle length. I’m 5’4”. Reg length is to long..Ankle length is just right.
5.0,My wife looks so pretty in this dress and it fits her perfectly
5.0,Perfect fall colors and super comfy
5.0,Awesome face mask love this very hard to find great price
5.0,I really like this strap it’s pretty and tropical I only wish it was a little longer.

5.0,"Love it! Perfect fit looks great, very complimentary"
5.0,"I had a great pair of gloves for years and lost one of them during the holidays last year.  I was very disappointed but ordered these and now I must admit I'm not sorry that I lost the old glove, these are FANTASTIC!  They are so warm and feel great on my hands.  I liked them so much I got a pair for my mother and daughter for Christmas this year."
5.0,Great for my granddaughter who has leukemia.
5.0,The color is a happy color and very comfortable.
5.0,"Was pleasantly surprised in the quality of this dress, the fit, and especially the softness of the fabric.  It fits well, very flattering, doesn't wrinkle AND under $10 dollars?!  What?? It looks good on its own..or with a jean jacket or sweater...love it.  If it helps...I am 65, 5'7"" 135 lbs and ordered the small.  Even a grandma can pull this look off!"
5.0,bbbbb
5.0,"Very cute! 5’4, 167lb, 36-29-46 and ordered a medium. Very conservatively flattering. If you have hips like me it won’t be as flowy but still really cute!"
5.0,"Super cute, both sided."
5.0,Love love love wish I could afford a regular size DB purse
5.0,"I'm wearing these socks every day during the winter because they're comfortable, warm, and look nice. After a couple of months I'm not seeing any signs of wear. I turn them inside out to wash, and hang them to dry. Much nicer than cotton socks."
5.0,"Nice and comfortable, fits perfectly."

5.0,10mm is very large... X large pea. Very pretty earrings.
5.0,I really love this dress. It’s perfect Blend of professional with a hint of sexy. I had to get a XXL and I typically wear a 12. XL was too small and I had to swap it out.
5.0,"I really like these Utopia's Capri Cotton/Spandex Yoga Leggings - they're comfortable, durable and well made.<br /><br />These fit pretty amazing. They are super soft and stay put when youre working out or running.<br /><br />They are very comfortable and true to size. No itching from the seams and the material is light.<br /><br />Definitely a product you should buy if you are in need for one.<br /><br />Overall I’m very satisfied with this product.<br /><br />My intention is to inform buyers of the quality and functions of products so that they can make better informed buying decisions.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive this product for trial and testing in exchange of my honest , 100 % opinion and unbiased review."
5.0,"these were absolutely great while living out of a backpack in Europe for two weeks, kept everything organized"
5.0,I ordered these multiple times. Great product!
5.0,Perfect solution to slippery wood floors and my daughter loves the designs.
5.0,Very nice and true to design.
5.0,I like it so far. Wish it made me sweat alittle more but overall very good.
5.0,Great. Pain stopped after a week
5.0,"This bundle of 5 scarves is so worth the price I paid.they are less than $3 per scarf, and you get free shipping. Perfect for summer!"
5.0,This belt comes as the picture describes it. It is durable and firm. I'm impressed with the quality of this belt.
5.0,"Good day, I want to tell you that for several months I have been looking for a pair of sunglasses that I liked and settle my face, I made two purchases and with none of them is satisfied, however seeing these letes I came back to excite and I decided to buy them, all the description that you made of your lenses is appropriate to the reality, I love the lenses, I congratulate you, if any more I wondered why lenses buy I would recommend the MANITOU."
5.0,Perfect for larp or under armor plus price was perfect. 4 in 1 link and some links had some gaps but for show or costume it's perfect if you need the look but not the protection and don't want to spend a ton then this is perfect
5.0,"I am normally a size 16, 40DD, and normally have to go up a size from Amazon clothing. I took a chance in following the size chart and got an XL. It fit perfectly and was very flattering, especially over my post-baby belly. Received several compliments on it. I wore it all day and it was very comfortable. The snap across the cleavage seems a little strange but holds nicely. I wore a cami underneath it and unsnapped it later and it still looked cute. Thinking of buying this in more colors. Loved it!"
5.0,Exactly what I expexted
5.0,"Very comfy and cute, fits perfectly"
5.0,Fits very nicely. Very satisfied with the quality of this dress.
5.0,"This is my third of these hoodies. They’re SO comfortable! You really do need to size up. I typically wear a medium and ordered a large in the first two, but they’re still rather fitted. I wanted something a bit bigger and cozier for this one so I sized up to an XL and love it just as much."
5.0,Loved the color and fit
5.0,Great value and versatility.  Used as a mask with comfort.  Occassional headband/hairband
5.0,Exactly what I needed!!
5.0,"Really pretty ring. I like that it is open. I wear it all the time!<br /><br />After wearing this ring for a while, I can add that I did not get a dark ring around my finger. It is durable and beautiful."
5.0,"OK first off I’m gonna start by saying that these boots are amazing. They are really cute, you can takeoff the buckle which is a bonus for those you don’t like the buckles. I will state this if you’re not too familiar with leather boots or cowboy boots in general when you get them they will be stiff at first so you’re gonna have to take the time to break them in. You’re gonna wanna wear boot high socks socks at first that way they don’t rub your skin Rall or wear skinny jeans with them to protect your legs until they are broken in. So they’re going to seem a little uncomfortable at first but that’s normal. Once you break them in they will be the most comfortable shoe you have ever owned. Also look at the reviews and you’ll see more positive than negative reviews. The negative reviews you see are most likely going to be from people that had a horrible experience with Amazon and have no experience with cowboy boots as well. Take it from a person it’s worn them for 15 years almost. You will also want to get the proper equipment to clean them and make sure you have she shapers and hold her so that way the calf of the boot does not warp and fall over and lose its shape because they won’t fit right after that. And get a shoe buffer made for boots leather boots especially to clean off the scuffs that will happen over time.<br /><br />However after reading the reviews some people said you go a size up or a half size up which I decided to do and they were actually too big for the half size up. So I would definitely recommend that when purchasing these or considering to purchase them that you get them in your actual size not the half size and not a full size up because they will be too big. I tried on a similar pair in stores and a half size and they fit perfectly so I decided to make the order and the half size same brand. But the just fit completely different.<br />After ordering the half size up they were too big for me and my foot slid around even with thick socks. So I contacted Amazon and they took care of me without a problem they issued a UPS pick up for the return process what’s the old you in the next morning. If you have to return it it will take them 3 to 5 days to give you your return back after they receive the product to make sure you sent back what you were supposed to heal and that it was in the same condition you received it. And then they give you the options to either refund it to the original payment method or as a gift card.<br /><br />That being said I saw some comments in the reviews that said that because they were too big or too small Amazon would not issue a return or exchange.  I spoke with Amazon today in chat and on the phone to confirm, if you order it in the wrong size they have to do a return they can’t do an exchange because they consider it a different product. But if it were the medium or the large like (the width) of the boot that was too big or too small then they could do an exchange. But because it’s a size that needs to be fixed they can’t do an exchange because the prices vary based on size and wet. Which is true if you go to a boot store or western store, you will notice that some boots even though it’s the exact same, the size will vary in price as well as the width of the boot."

5.0,I was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews I purchased this for my husband.  The coat looks great and fits him perfectly!! Great quality and you definitely can't beat the price.
5.0,Most baseball/trucker hats look odd on me. I like this low-profile crown. The bill is just the right size. I appreciate all of the small details and quality materials. I especially enjoy the subtle smiles I get from others.
5.0,Beautiful dress and after two summers it is still just a beautiful!
5.0,"This bathing suit is super cute.  I read some mixed reviews on sizing, so I went ahead and ordered the medium and the large. The large was a perfect fit. (I am 4’11, 125 pounds). The bottoms do not cover much at all, so if that is something you are concerned about, keep that in mind.<br />Overall, this is my new favorite bathing suit!"
5.0,Awesome value
5.0,I love it... machine wash and still looks great! Adjustable to size.. love the cute design..
5.0,I have worn these for years and paid $13-$14 each at WalMart.  This is the first time I've gone online to see if I could get them cheaper.  What a great bargain!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:33e25595d65534862364461c0b3d3d7d]] I absolutely LOVE this dress. I probably needed to iron it before wearing it because it was a little wrinkled from shipping but I was just too excited. I got a large and it fit PERFECTLY. I'm 5'1 and 158 lbs, size 36b bra. I love the grey because I can mix and match with other shirts and jackets. Its casual and yet super cute!"
5.0,"I love these pants - they were a great vacation buy!  The fabric is super light and breezy, they were perfect for the beach.  They can also make a super cute going out outfit - easy to dress up or down!  They do run a little bit small.  I ordered a L and contemplated exchanging for an XL (thick thigh probs) but I kept the L and they are fine, just have to have them sitting at JUST the right spot or they ride up in not flattering places."
5.0,Very good quality. My daughter loves it... she is taking it any where... it is her favorite. Thank you for the quality..
5.0,Looked awesome and felt great. I am 5'8&#34; 145lbs

5.0,Replaces lost earrrings

5.0,I teach water aerobics and I am in the water all of the time!  This is my 3rd Nixon watch!! I love this watch!
5.0,Literally the best glasses I’ve ever purchased. 10/10. Buy them. They’re unbreakable. And surprisingly stylish. I’m 22. And look so wiked.
5.0,"The material is a little noisy, but it's a nice jacket! Very warm."
5.0,I am 5'2 about 130 lbs and ordered a Med. This dress fit a little lose but nothing to noticeable. I love that you are able to wear a regular bar and has pockets. I couldn't be happier with this purchase and received a ton of complements.
5.0,"These are the most comfortable work pants I've ever owned. They are excellent quality, material and stitching are perfect. I'm a tall, curvy woman, and these pants fit perfectly."
5.0,Pretty mask but didn’t find the battery.

5.0,Love as always Nike top.  Little expensive but I wanted cap sleeve.  Do not find often.
5.0,Just love the Gabby sandal.
5.0,Good quality for price. Got this for drag and glued chain and stones on it.... definitely worth getting and making your own.
5.0,"Very comfortable and pretty..Well made.Not a lot of support but enough if you aren't jogging. I liked it.I chose a size up due to reviews but ended up taking it in a bit for a snugger fit so custom fit for me. It washed well but I hung to dry and it looks fine. I would buy it again. Quick shipping,well packaged."
5.0,Love the oversized look!
5.0,"These joggers are so cute and they have a really nice feel to them. They are well made and fitted. They are stretchy enough to move in but do not lose shape over the course of the day. The olive great. I have washed several times with no fading. Happy to have received these pants. Persist stands by their products, they even have a card with your order that if it wears in a duration of time they will replace! Great company."
5.0,beautiful!! Love the setting also!!
5.0,I got this for my daughter for her sobriety date. She absolutely loved it. It shipped quickly and was just as described.
5.0,"It's pretty, fits just right and hasn't tarnished yet. I really like it, and for a great price."
5.0,I bought this for a gift.  It’s the perfect size and the coin fits really snug .  Great product
5.0,"I got one of these 8 years ago.  And mine is still nice!  The black that some are mentioning I had once also.  I hit mine with a little mother's wax. Brought it right back to life.  But it is well worth the money.  Nice quality.  And a solid piece.  I will be  buying another to put on a chain.  But the one I own now, I wearers single day.  Shop with confidence."
5.0,"If you are in between sizes, size down. Absolutely in love with these shorts. I need them in every color."

5.0,Socks are great!
5.0,A great quality cap for a good price.
5.0,We live in Hawaii and always have a difficult time finding lightweight warm weather costumes.  This one is perfect! And it’s so soft too.
5.0,Great hat. Nicely made. Good quality.
5.0,"I have tried 3 different brands of compression socks, including the Magic Copper&#34; socks, but the are far superior in terms of style, quality and build. I have diabetes and suffer from swollen ankle. The Miracle Copper socks help keep the swelling down, but these socks actually stop the swelling, and return your feet to their or swollen state!!!"
5.0,"The earrings look very expensive. The color is brilliant red and it reflects the light perfectly. The silver portion is neither too shiny, nor dull. I receive a lot of compliments when I wear them."
5.0,I bought this for my 12 year old daughter for Halloween. She loved it!!
5.0,Bought more since these are so comfortable for her.
5.0,"Wonderful pants, very comfortable. I will probably purchase more."
5.0,"Little smaller inside than I was hoping, but I love the pockets to keep things organized.  It is a sturdy purse and looks expensive. I don't like big purses and this is a great size."
5.0,"These are *great* pants! 8S fit my curvy/athletic 5'3&#34; 135 frame perfectly. If you gain a little weight, the stretch has you covered; if you lose some, the drawstring will save the day. A little wider than I expected at the ankle (can't imagine how wide the bootcut is), but that kept them from looking like leggings, and pass as dressier pants than they are (in black, anyway -- not sure that would work in a lighter color). Basically the ideal travel pants."
5.0,"I have tried numerous face masks and always have one issue or another and have yet to find the perfect fit.  This mask provides a secure fit, my glasses don't fog because of a great fit and the elastic that goes around my ears does not irritate or make me feel like my ears stick out.  Extremely comfortable."
5.0,"Just received this today, came earlier than expected. The fit is great and I have a usually large head for beanies, the lettering is perfect. Except mine is black with white lettering, but that doesn't bother me to much. Everything is spelled right and it really doesn't feel like a very cheap quality beanie. In love with this purchase!"
5.0,These masks are easy to breathe in and fit great. I have a small face and usually the mask takes up my whole face or straps are too long and I have to tie them and it hurts my ears. But these masks fit and stay up on my face.
5.0,"Impressed by the quality. Good fit, wears comfortably."
5.0,"Arrived quickly, excellent packaging. Each pair came in a nice fabric bag with a cleaning wipe. The glasses are nicely made. Highly recommended!"
5.0,Love it use it in hot or rainy
5.0,"Very cute purse and came exactly as described, however, it was much smaller than I imagined. I admit that I do not remember checking the dimensions so not upset just wanted to make people aware that this is a slim, single pocket crossbody with an additional slimmer pocket in the front and the fold over portion also unzips to provide some storage but not a lot as the top will not fold over when too full. Is great for a slim wallet and phone and then maybe a few accessories in the additional pockets but definitely not big enough for what I would consider an everyday bag."
5.0,"This bra is great. I got it in 32E and I love it. It supports well and does a good job of keeping bounce down for my jogging. I don't do anything super crazy so I don't know how it would perform  under huge stress. But for walks, jogging, and comfort it's great."
5.0,Love the classic locs
5.0,"color pops,goes with everything"
5.0,Bracelet was perfect. Received one as a gift and wanted another one for my daughter. Love  the clasp !
5.0,My husband loves these shirts and for the price you cannot beat the value. Moisture wicking easy to wash and dry. Don’t judge the size fit as Amazon wants to recommend using my data
5.0,"I'm short and can never find long dresses that I'm not sweeping the floor with. This is the perfect length. The bottom is a bit too see through, so make sure to not wear printed underwear!"
5.0,Have received a lot of complements about this watch !
5.0,"**Another Update! 4/20/17**<br />The customer service of Messic has been absolutely PHENOMENAL. They are quick to respond to emails and quick to do anything to make the customer happy! I will absolutely purchase from them again. So, they pretty much said (not verbatim), we want to make it up to you so here's a link and look at our clothes, find something you would like to try&#34; (I emphasize try because it meant that they will send me the clothes I'm interested in and I can try them on, keep the one I liked best). I perused the options, and found a top I adored! I emailed them back with the product number and size (at like 11 at night) and two days later (today) I get it in the mail! I did not need to pay for shipping or anything. Everything complimentary! I literally just tried it on and LOVE it!!! I'm going to try and see if I can post a link to the top they sent me, and/or if I can write a review on it. AMAZING customer service, kind, willing to work with the customer, takes design suggestions, will do what it takes to make the customer happy, and so much more. I will ABSOLUTELY buy from them again! *I was neither paid nor asked to post this review, was not offered any compensation to post this review. I did it of my own volition because this is literally the best customer service I've ever had on Amazon.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I received a lovely email from the company literally less than 3 hours after posting this! Talk about great customer service! The email stated that they would like to do what they could to &#34;make up for this.&#34; Yes, absolutely they may! I do like the product quality, and am very pleased that they reached out. They even thanked me for my honest opinion and did not ask me to change my review...I chose to change it on my own. They even said that they would talk with the design department to make improvements. THIS is the type of company I want to buy from. I appreciate them taking the time to reach out to me and take my review into serious consideration in terms of design. Like, WOW! I'm updating this to 5 stars because of the customer service experience!<br /><br />________<br />Not doing one star only because I do not like the word &#34;hate.&#34; Nevertheless, it does deserve one star. The idea of it is cute, however it is NOT how it appears in the picture. It's shorter than depicted and is slightly see-through (don't wear a black bra with it). Additionally, the sleeves are not as long as depicted. I was excited for this but when I tried it on, the seam that's supposed to be below the breasts was nearly as high up as my armpits - it pretty much only covered half of my breasts. The pleating isn't so cute, either. I'm 5'5, 163 lbs, 34DD. Not for members of the itty bitty titty committee! I'm going to return it :( I'll post a photo of it later on (if I can). Very sad :("
5.0,These mask are GREAT for kids I have a 7 and 8 year old that are going back to school I'm person...these mask make me feel so much better about them attending school with all that's going on out there
5.0,My good friend is an Airforce vet -- I gave it to him for his birthday.  He loves the hat and wears it everyday (along with the set of patches I also gave him); he said that this cap fits perfectly;  he likes being able to put items into the internal pockets.  Recommended!
5.0,"very nicely made and wash is just right. fits so much better than the 3x, which I gifted to my mum."
5.0,Very soft; fabrics kind of have a subtle shine to them when you look closely. After reading reviews I ordered an xl and I'm normally a medium sometimes a small. They fit just barely loose. I like a little slack for comfort and these were perfect.
5.0,"If you like the style of a Hermes band, but you don't want to pay the big price for it, buy this band. I go through a lot of watch bands and I keep coming back to this one. The material is soft, it's easy to install and look beautiful on your wrist. I wasn't sure if i'd like the bracelet concept, but once you get used to it you realize it has a very masculine look to it. (I'm sure both Male's and Female's will enjoy this band) I've been getting a lot of compliments on the band and I couldn't be happier with it. I have no real complaints about this band. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review."
5.0,It’s definitely worth the buy!!! I love it!!
5.0,Very heavy not a flimsy robe at all . Very soft and feel like a millionaire in it .  Great for winter and colder weather thick soft warm comfy fluffy and  sexy looking for sure.  Don't buy junk.......  this one rocks

5.0,"Fit as expected, ordered for skating"
5.0,Unique design and very nice.
5.0,"Great little cutter,honestly smaller than I thought itd be. Cuts nice and crisp every time. I purchased about 20 cigars for a wedding and everyone that used the cutter commented how nice it was.<br />Update 10-11-2020<br />Cutter is pretty dull so it commonly tears the cigars or leaves some behind and I only smoke 2-4 cigars a month for the past year."
5.0,Boot dryer works great and dries the shoes/boots out! It’s quiet and just perfect to keep your feet dry the next day!
5.0,Love my new purse!!  Very roomy. Oilcloth had a weird smell when first opened. Disappeared after a few days.
5.0,Very sturdy. Nicely constructed
5.0,Fantastic.  It’s a great belt. Lots of complete.
5.0,Excellent for petite people like my daughter who is only 5'2&#34; and  has a tiny face. Price is excellent also.

5.0,super fabulous and chic. i love them. not too dark but dark enough so you cant see my eyes. they feel sturdy.
5.0,I ordered this for my wife. After reading the reviews I decide to order her a size bigger. Turned out perfect. She love the costume and highly recommend.
5.0,"This works perfect for me for work it is smaller and shorter then others I have tried which is good because I can take it in and out with out tugging and because it is shorter it doesn't poke me. I LOVE IT. It does have a sharp end but like I said it shouldn't bother you because the stud is fairly short. it does have a black spot in the center which if you look closely just looks like a blackhead which doesn't bother me, but just so you know."
5.0,"Love this top, it fits great and the length is perfect. It keeps you cool as well because the material is thin but not in the cheap way."
5.0,Quality product. Happy with fit.
5.0,I love this bracelet! All my friends want one!
5.0,Need more info on buying same model but different colors. Love more colors.

5.0,"I love the Nike brand and glad I found this sports bra. I will definitely give the Baker family 5 Stars due to delivering as promised. Even more important, teaching their children value of working to obtain their goals in life. I am extremely impressed! Also, thanks for the gum ! I hope all your dreams come true!"
5.0,"Good fit, just right amount of warmth vs wicking.  Im 5'8 165 and these are perfect for hunting in the northeast winters, sitting for hours on end with an additional layer."
5.0,"Following another tumultuous harvest season on our family's vineyard; I wanted to get my wife a small token of my appreciation for her patience and support of this trying time.  These earrings caught my eye, and based on the description, met her preferences.  Now that we've received them, I am extremely pleased with their appearance and quality.  The pearls have a nice luster and show multiple colors in varying light.  While they do look like a grape cluster, it's not so obvious/over-the-top as to be cheesy.  Are they heirloom-quality jewels; hmmm... who cares?  She likes the look and feel of them, and wears them frequently."

5.0,"Great price, fit"
5.0,Thank you for a Great Top!
5.0,"Love the quality workmanship, style, fit & price! Highly recommended...100% satisfied customer!<br />Disappointed cannot reorder different colors...why the lack of supply?"
5.0,"Beautiful, nicely made, classy."
5.0,"I just got these shoes about 30 minutes ago and I put them on and I'm obsessed!!  They do run a little small, I'm normally a pretty true 7.5 and tend to size down in flats but the 8 fits perfectly! They are super light weight and comfortable."
5.0,"It is waterproof, windproof, and locks in the warmth of your body that is all to the plus! Now on to the minus this jacket we had to order two sizes bigger then what it called for to give extra room in case if she wanted to wear a sweater underneath of it. Also this particular jacket when it came in the mail it had no care instructions on washing or whether you can even dry it in a dryer so I had to text a service representative in order to find out how to take care of this jacket."
5.0,I love the look of all black it looks so good
5.0,"Great looking watch. I'm impressed with how sturdy it is, yet so very light.  You can hardly feel it on your wrist."

5.0,It fit great and comfortable on my son foot.
5.0,Very nice looking and I would order again!
5.0,The Size
5.0,Brought some joy during COVID
5.0,"I usually wear a M width shoe.  I rarely find a sandal that fits comfortably across my toes.  I usually end up with a blister on big toe area.  I ordered the Pruce ankle strap sandal in 8W.  It fit so well and so comfortable that I ordered a second pair!  I have one in black another in the almond/natural color.  I know if I ordered in M width they would have been too narrow and scrunched my toes!  Would have returned them.  Definitely recommend this sandal, but in W width.  Nine West please continue to make this fabulous sandal but more options in Wide width and I will buy!!!!!  Did I mention absolutely walking and dancing in these cute Pruce sandals?"
5.0,"Really cute swimsuit, especially for the price! Material is thicker, cut is very flattering. The size fit just as I expected. I got several compliments on it, and even went back and bought it black when it went on sale."
5.0,"I really like these. At the time I bought these I also bought another brand to compare. These shirts won. Fit is perfect, good material,  comfortable and luv the colors. I will buy more if they come in short sleeve and/or tank"
5.0,Love it....would def. recommend...
5.0,"I love these. I have purchased multiple packs.  They are thin and light, but durable enough that they hold my long dreads back and away from my face. I have purchased multiple packs and am always happy with the shipping time. Will be purchasing more in different colours/patterns"
5.0,Great deal! Looks quality for the price paid.
5.0,I got lot of compliments wearing this
5.0,Very useful. Nice fitting. Now I can read books lying in bed on my side without problem from eyeglasses temple pieces.
5.0,"Beautiful, but small. Will pass it on to my 12 yr.old grandaughter. She will love it T.Y."
5.0,I have been on a seemingly constant hunt for true no-show socks. Many that I have seen in stores or online (and purchased) there that claimed no-show were far from it. These are exactly what I have been looking for. They fit wonderfully and don't slip. I'll definitely be purchasing more.
5.0,I got them for my 11 year old niece for tie dye. They will work out great! The bag is a little thicker so it needs a little more dye than the scarves but not much. Good set for kids to tie dye.
5.0,This sweater is beautiful.  Well made and soft to the touch.  It fits perfectly.  Will be ordering another one that's similar.
5.0,"cute, fit nicely."

5.0,loved this outfit wqas super cute for christmas pictures for my little boy
5.0,My son had to dress up like Stan Lee for school. He wears glasses so I couldn't just give him a pair of aviator sunglasses to wear. I bought these for him to clip to his glasses and they worked great! I'll be using these for him on the daily!
5.0,Lots of sparkle for the price
5.0,This dress is so cute! I purchased it in yellow. It is a little see through so I’ll have to wear a slip. I’m 5’8 and a size 14 in dresses and I got the XXL.
5.0,"These are super comfy, fit perfectly and cute! I'm a small and ordered a small 5'6"" 120 lbs"
5.0,"I work at an elementary school, so I get so many compliments that I’m buying them for most my co-workers. Sucks to wait so long for shipping, but awesome little earrings when they come in. My ears are very sensitive too and these don’t bother them at all. They are super light weight I forget I’m wearing them. Grab a couple colors and mix them up."
5.0,"Just right, good merchandise, good price"

5.0,Was a gift and yet not gifted!  As described.  Will be a hit I know!
5.0,"I'm buying my second package for a trip to Florida.  Slippage on my feet depends on shoe styles.  Since I often wear Crocs it's nothing to shift one that gets bothersome, but that rarely happens.  I have both hand-washed and machine-washed these, but always dry them flat  And in the washer I use a net bag."
5.0,AMAZING SO CUTE.  My 28 year old sister is obsessed with Disney I bought this for her as a birthday present and she Absolutely loved them they are beautiful
5.0,"Me encantan, fácil de poner y csmbiar"
5.0,"Originally bought ring too small, return was easy, ordered a new one. Happy customer!"

5.0,stunning!
5.0,Better than pictured!  It is a simple but beautiful ring with a rich deep blue stone. No chips or imperfections.
5.0,A gift for my son and he loved it.  Beautiful shirt!  Unique.

5.0,"I love these glasses, I was a bit hesitant to order them at first due to the fact that three other reviews said  that they received these glasses broken, however I took a chance and boy am I ever glad that I did ."
5.0,Perfect subsitute for Oakelys for kids
5.0,"Love this, just ordered my daughter one as well."
5.0,"A little background - I had just ordered 3 pairs of gymsharks and ending up hating all of them so I decided to give these a try. So glad I did! I'm 5'3 115 and ordered an XS in the Steele blue marl and it fits perfect. Perfect length and tightness. I also ordered the blue ombre+ and they were way too tight so I returned. If you are looking for compression, go with the ombre+, not these. At first, these felt a lot thinner than I expected and I was worried they would be see through but once they are on, they are not see through at all. Have worn them on a hard leg day and they passed every test! No camel toe, squat proof and did not have to pull them up once!!! Just ordered the charcoal pair and planning on getting more."
5.0,Cloth is really a nice size shined my silver jewelry like new will recommend.
5.0,I love this dress it fits me perfect and material is excellent for the price
5.0,They fit as expected and comfortable
5.0,"We have used these for YEARS!  Wine remains safe and secure in your checked luggage.  They hold mag bottles, too!<br />The only issue I have is that after a few years of use, the strap breaks off the bottle area.  We then duct tape it to get a few more months out of it, but purchase more when it no longer holds... ;-)"
5.0,"Gorgeous as it looks in the picture.  If I could figure out how to wear two, I'd buy another!"
5.0,Great product for the price!!
5.0,Beautiful scarf! Vivid coloring!
5.0,"Excellent ring!  Looks sharp and the photos represent the expected quality.  Fiancee got this for me for my &#34;temp&#34; wedding band, but have decided to wear it off and on.  For under $25, it's worth it!"
5.0,Granddaughter was very happy with gift
5.0,Excelent quality.
5.0,Great face mask without a filter but I put in a filter in the pocket.
5.0,"Perfect fit, comfortable and flattering cut."
5.0,Makes a great gift
5.0,This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it and it fits perfectly.
5.0,Dress looks good once you put it on.  It is a little longer thank expected and a little scratchy but does look exactly like the picture.
5.0,Son loves it. He plays in school band.
5.0,It came in the mail 3 weeks earlier than shipping estimate. My wrists are very small but it fits perfectly doesn't fall off but still loose enough to dangle which I love. Its two sets I wasn't expecting two so that was great and its just beautiful very trendy.
5.0,I am really happy with the results ;)
5.0,Very warm and great quality
5.0,I love that the seamless have some compression and don't stretch out like the gymsharks do! I was on the fence and sure i wouldn't like these but they are awesome!

5.0,"Oh my gosh this tunic is soooo pretty! I got the black and couldn't be more pleased with it. I'm 5'9&#34; and 140 pounds, and the medium fits marvelously. It looks expensive, too! My only regret is that I didn't order two at once so now I have to wait while another ships to me!"
5.0,wear these every day!
5.0,Excellent Glasses and in the deep South you need them .
5.0,"Most comfortable goggles I've ever used - I tried three different ones - all leaked water unless I had them really tight and uncomfortable.  I'm so glad I believed the reviews on this one.  Comfortable, never leaks, rarely fogs and allows me to swim longer as I don't have that pain under my eyes like I used to get. I highly recommend these."
5.0,Perfect! Go Patriots!
5.0,they are nice weight and very soft. Fits great.
5.0,Love the Thai dye. Very comfy and cute color
5.0,"This is my favorite dress ever! It's so comfortable and pretty. It runs true to size. I normally wear a large and ordered a large and it fits perfectly. The waist is not tight at all, just gives a little shape to the dress, fits great at the top and has  a beautiful flowy bottom part that hides everything! There are 2 things to be aware of....and I'm only speaking of the red dress with white flowers here....1) I washed the dress in cold water, gentle cycle and used woolite detergent. Hung it up to dry and noticed that the red dye had bled onto the white flowers, so while it was still wet, I soaked it in some oxi clean solution for a while, then rinsed it well. It helped a lot, but there were still a little pink dye on a few of the flowers. I wore it again and then washed it again in cold water, gentle cycle and woolite. Hung it up to dry and it's perfect again. No more pink on the flowers. 2) the hemline is curved. Lower on the sides and higher in the middle. I don't think this was a sewing error, I think it was supposed to be this way. It looks like it anyway. But it's a great dress. I wish the seller had more patterns to choose from. I would definitely buy more."
5.0,recieved at a discount there GREAT!!!!
5.0,Made of metal that is nice and smooth across the edges and surface. There are no defects in the paint and it has a nice low shine. My super hero loving son is going to be very happy to receive this shield. I absolutely would recommend.
5.0,Wearing masks sucks so putting a little humor into it makes things more interesting. I like the smile mask. It doesn't wash well. My smile was cracked after second wash.
5.0,Comfortable easy to hike/walk in.
5.0,super cute . passport fits perfectly & has room for credit cards !
5.0,The cold weather has finally arrived in the northeast and I have had the opportunity to use these gloves during the past few days. They are quite warm. The touchscreen capability of the gloves allows for phone use without exposing your hands to the cold.
5.0,"I love these glasses...they're comfortable, stylish and they come with a beautiful, sturdy case!  Highly recommend!"
5.0,great sunglasses!!!
5.0,"These are awesome,fit,design,soft and warm and comfortable<br />Love them!"
5.0,Smaller than I anticipated but Beautiful piece.
5.0,This blanket is super soft and the graphic is clear and colorful! I was surprised by the quality of the image. The backside is white but that doesn’t bother me. Would recommend!
5.0,The fit and color. Casual wear
5.0,"Beautiful necklace, perfect for a gift my daughter loved it. The color of every planet is just beautiful."
5.0,I am a big fan of silicone rings. I am very active and tend to do damage to either hard-metal rings or to my fingers in the process. This is not my first purchase of these and likely won't be my last.
5.0,Very cute and flattering. Fits as expected. The lace detail on the back is so cute
5.0,"This hat is a very well thought out accessory for gardening and really any other outdoor activities. I would wear it to summer sports events, boating, flea markets etc.<br /><br />The hat has a nice, wide brim that’s a little floppy to give sun protection to the eyes, ears and the back of the neck.<br /><br />The crown has horizontal vented mesh openings to release heat with loose fabric coverings to help prevent rain from getting in. It also has a drawstring (my favorite feature) that makes the hat adjustable. Great for a true fit with the extra bonus of being able to tighten the hat on windier days. No more chasing hats!<br /><br />Speaking of wind I think it’s time to end the review and spare your eyes from further reading. I’ll just wrap up by saying if you like to have a hat that protects you from the sun without overheating then this is the one for you.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful to y’all."
5.0,"It's hard to find straps that fit my fat wrist, but this fits perfectly! High quality and looks great."
5.0,I used these curly key bracelets exactly for what they were intended for my house keys.
5.0,My husband loves it but it does run a bit small.
5.0,Beautiful necklace.Very lightweight and comfortable.Great packaging as well.😀
5.0,"I love this top. I wear a medium,  but purchased a large because i have wide hips and small waistline.  The material stretches, feels cool and easy to put on."
5.0,Goodies rash guards. I love them
5.0,Custom was a bit large for a small. Shorts definitely showed this.
5.0,"I'm seriously in love with this dress. I found it to be true to size (I normally wear a small or sometimes medium, and the small fits perfectly), and the material is the perfect thickness. I am wearing it with a petticoat in this pic, but it also looks good without one. I would easily pay twice what I paid for this dress."
5.0,"I have gotten so many compliments on this scarf! It is soft & comfortable, & I love the size & color."
5.0,"I needed sunglasses for a trip but didn't want to fork over the money to get prescription ones, especially with my track record- including but not limited to: losing, misplacing, scratching or breaking said sunglasses.<br />These did the job well. They clip on and off with ease and you can barely tell they're clipped on. Not looking too dorky was my number 1 concern to be honest, and my wife and kids all seemed to approve of these. They are slim and lightweight enough to slip in your shorts pocket or you can simply clip them on your shirt collar, which is what I mainly did.<br />Aside from looking good, the primary function of blocking the sun works well too. The clarity is great and my eyes couldn't be happier.<br />I'm only sorry I didn't get these sooner as I have just kind of getting by without sunglasses at all. I highly recommend giving these a try."
5.0,I purchased this belt through their Kickstater program. I workes well and has the traditional look I wanted in a ratchet style belt. It is well made and pretty simple to size for my needs with a pair of scissors. The chrome looks good on my belt belt and the other color belts I purchased from them.
5.0,Great hoodie! Tons of compliments! No regrets! Love it!
5.0,Perfect fit and hugs the body in all the right places. Nice color and washes well too! So glad I bought this dress
5.0,Excelente muchas gracias
5.0,"This dress looks sophisticated. The material is great, perfect for special occasion."
5.0,Love the quality & design. Ordered a Medium initially. Too big. I usually wear medium. Got a small and its still a bit loose but way better!
5.0,I worried a bit that this top might be too short  ( I’m 5’8”) but it’s perfect. The ditsy pattern is adorable and the material is a good heavier weight cotton. A win!
5.0,Really pretty for the money look glamorous for special occasions!
5.0,"i usually get a size medium, but i decided to get a small with this sweater and it was the perfect fit!!"
5.0,Great light compression. Makes my tired legs feel more comfortable. Thin enough to wear with any of my shoes.
5.0,"Love these! Very comfortable, perfect and pretty for summer"
5.0,very well the best
5.0,"Cute style. Sleeves are a bit long but bunch up nicely at the wrist. I'm 5'6&#34;, size 12, and busty. I ordered an XL: it fits beautifully and goes down to mid-calf."

5.0,daughter loves it and for $25 she better lol
5.0,I purchased these as a gift for my hairdresser who has a daughter named Luna....she loved them!
5.0,"The first thing that struck me was the minimal packaging; wallet wrapped in tissue paper inside of a recycled cardboard folding box. Nice to see a company reduce waste with as little packaging as possible.<br />Now the wallet... WOW! Very, very nice material and build. I'm sure this will last for a long time, without a doubt. Stitches are study and even, leather is of sufficient grade and my stuff fit inside without issue. I have 6 cards and cash inside and its still slim enough to comfortably fit in my front pocket with ease. If I could rate it higher, I would! Great product!"
5.0,MOM LOVED IT
5.0,"I normally wear a 10, should have went up a size"
5.0,Think my grandson will really be pleased with it.
5.0,I love this hat. It's exactly what I was looking for - a perfect balance between comfort and fashion.<br />My head does get itchy over time but to be honest I haven't found a beanie where I don't experience itchiness.
5.0,"I have a pretty big jewelry collection, but there are the items I wear most often, these earrings have definitely become part of the ones I wear more often. I recommend buying them, they look great and the price was great!"
5.0,This is a very nice costume. The tulle flows nicely and is not stiff. It is a great quality costume. Even the satin is very pretty. The accessories that came with it are also very cute. My daughter wears this costume everywhere. Huge fan and I love seeing my little girl super hero running around.
5.0,Better than the pictures.super fast shipping
5.0,Nothing I use my purse all the time
5.0,"I had originally bought a single sports bra like this, I loved it so much I bought the 4 pack. Fun colors and very comfy. Fit is just right!! I’m a 36DD and large is perfect."
5.0,Great waterproof watch for the price. Highly recommend it.
5.0,"These briefs are amazing to me.  I am in shape but not a man with a perfect slim and trim body and this pair of briefs fits me snugly, are extremely comfortable and show off my body really well.  They are low rise and I really can't rave their quality and durability enough.  Go with whatever color you want for they look even better in person.  Highly recommend."
5.0,"I love the way these panties look, feel, and fit.They are very soft and comfortable to wear.This set comes with 2 Blue panties and 2 black panties,They have a lace trim around the leg area that adds a sexy accent to them.They are also low rise and have a cheeky fit in the back.The front is a sheer material that looks really sexy against the skin. These panties are very well made and they are true to size. They fit me perfectly.<br />They are the perfect balance of simple and sexy. The lace is also nice.It is not the cheap itchy stuff, even after being washed. This is a very nice pantie set and I love how I look and feel in them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.All opinions are 100% my own."
5.0,Perfect Christmas gift.
5.0,These were actually very comfortable to wear.  The USB port seems to better placed than is a previous pair I own.

5.0,Soft material and fits nicely.
5.0,"color isn't same as picture, but it is beautiful and durable - I always drop my sunglasses, not sure why, and so far these still look good. It didn't scratch easily. I have a wide face and this side is perfect to cover from side to side."
5.0,Great fitting and very stylish!
5.0,Bought these for my girls so cute
5.0,"very well made.<br />beautiful , she loves them."
5.0,Love this style!!!  Very feminine and true to size!
5.0,"Raymond Weil is a Top Tier company. This was a was a birthday gift for my incredible wife. She is my strength, and the Love Of My Life.....she is a victim of Cancer who possesses near super human strength. The minute I found the Raymond Weil watches on Amazon, I knew I had found the perfect watch....the Tocata. This watch goes beyond beauty. It is an incredibly accurate timepiece, with an easily read face that does not detract from it's feminine appeal. The design of the Tocata is dressy, as well as functionally casual. Simply stated, it is perfect!"
5.0,Nice tanks
5.0,It was a gift and she loves it.
5.0,This pin is the perfect addition to my ball cap.
5.0,Love the Scotte pant!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:9a0c0a17aefcaab464add1e658058582]] Shipped fast, just in time for Trinidad Carnival! This mask is definitely an attention getter for parties and fetes!"
5.0,"OK so I bought this for my Sailor Moon loving friend for Christmas and she Loves it!!! It's a little different looking than in the picture though, like the fur is more white but it still looks really really cute. I totally want to order her the purple one for her birthday. XD"
5.0,"I loved this necklace, I like its size, its blue color, and also that it has not rusted.<br />iMe encanta este collar!, por su tamano, color y ademas se nota su buena calidad y no se ha oxidado para nada."
5.0,Very satisfied. I would purchase again.
5.0,Worth the money. WAY easier to use then a purse. I received the product as it should be.
5.0,Bands worked out great with my Timex Weekender T2N855 watch.
5.0,"I love these Capris!  They fit great, perfect length and the price was right.  I haven't utilized the pocket yet, but the thick band it's great for extra tummy support.  Just washed them and hung to dry, and they look great and fit the same.  Will definitely be buying more of this brand."
5.0,i love these! it would make a great gift too
5.0,Best backpack and light. Was ideal for the trip I took.
5.0,"Beautiful, I love it!!"
5.0,"This items looks very pretty, feminine filigree design on chain and moon.  It's not too large, nor heavy.  Great value, dresses up an outfit.  The green glowing center is a nice accent."
5.0,Much more comfortable than the stock wristband. Have only had a few days so I'm not sure about durability yet but seems to be made well and I don't foresee any issues.
5.0,I ordered 2 sizes up; lov. Would buy again.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:adc218d8686238ad37df32f35f2e28bd]] They are nice. They do have a little weight to them so personally I don’t wear them for more than two hours. Overall they’re good though
5.0,Para un regalo
5.0,slim and nice looking. touch ID works and it seems like it will be ecure for water
5.0,"Quality, price, design, the best"
5.0,"Extremely surprised. For the price I thought it would be junk but would serve my husbands purpose if it worked..... The watch turned out to be attractive and stylish.....Arrived on time, works beautifully, watch was as advertised. Great Value."
5.0,"REALLY HIGH, but it looks so cute. The soles are more plastic than rubber (because this is a cheap quality shoe probably made in China and nothing like the actual ones that are rubber soled and 90$+) but it really does the trick. I don't recommend wearing them for super long, they do hurt because the sole is thick and hard, but it really is cute and good for the price for an imitation shoe. It's also quite sturdy."
5.0,"Love these Vigoss Girls' Bermuda Shorts. They fit perfectly and are so comfy!  I now have several pairs so I'll never run out of them! Thank you, Vigoss and Amazon.com  Aloha, Nancy On Maui"
5.0,Having to wear a mask and glasses at work caused my glasses to fog continually. This product solved that problem nicely.
5.0,Absolutely love fits perfect and looks fabulous.  Highly recommend. Looked so nice I bought the black one too
5.0,"I loved this product. Exactly the kind of shirt/dress belt that I was looking for!!<br />✓ This product arrived on time and in perfect condition. No damages at all. Excellent packaging!<br />✓ I am 5'2""-115 lbs- US size Small (2-4). Got a Size Small, brown belt. Worked perfectly for me!<br />✓ Quality: Good. The front part feels and looks like leather.<br />✓ The side part (aka the crochet part) is stretchable. Good elasticity. You'll have to button up at the back. Has a Criss cross leather tie in the front too (That's mostly for the stylish look. But I guess you can adjust that as well if needed. I didn't try this). Totally a very stylish design.<br />✓ High waist, wide belt. Suitable for long shirts, sweaters, dresses, shirt dress etc.<br />✓ Gives a good shape for those dresses that give a slightly awkward or shapeless look when worn without a belt.<br />✓ I got the brown belt. The color is very similar to what is shown in the pictures.<br />✓ Foldable after use! Good for packing and traveling.<br />✓ I wore this belt with a sweater. Gave me a perfect shape and helped a lot with tummy control!<br />My review: This is a good quality, fashionable shirt/dress belt at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,Very comfortable and stylish. I love these sandals.
5.0,"I'm in love with the stoppers by Bella. The quality and beauty is outstanding. I've always found most plain stoppers seem to take away from the over all design. But, Bella's stoppers are art. They complement and complete the beads. And a word about functionality, they are tight and once you put them on... THEY STAY PUT. No sliding or moving. I couldn't ask for anything better."
5.0,"Love this necklace, great quality and I get tons of compliments on it when I wear it"
5.0,Came faster then said very happy with them. Definitely going to order more
5.0,"When I first put on the glasses, I was looking at the balloons, and I could distinguish between the blue and purple, which I couldn’t do before trying on the EnChromas. It wasn’t until I looked at some magenta flowers that it really hit me. It was an entirely new color for me; I had never seen anything like it before. It was just a totally separate color than anything in my spectrum. I expected to be able to distinguish reds and greens and blues and purples, but I had no idea I would see an entirely new color. It was definitely an “omg” moment, and I broke down. I spent the next couple of days keeping an eye out for my new favorite color every time I had the glasses on."
5.0,These are very cute polkadotted cat eye sun glasses that are fun to wear. The a simple platic frames that are light weight and comfortable on. The come with a storage bag that will help when I put them in my purse so I do not scratch the lense.  This review is my own 100% unbiased opinion. #Sponsored
5.0,"My wife likes this shirt, the material is soft and enjoyable. Perfect for any adventure time fan!"
5.0,This dress is beautiful and flattering. Sits as expected once you get the right size. Go a size smaller and you will fall in love with it.
5.0,"Loved it, just what I expected."
5.0,Decent quality and excellent style.  I was stopped going into the grocery store by a lady who wanted to know where I bought them.
5.0,"Oh my goodness!!  Finally a bra that fits and is comfortable!! I love it!!  Every bra I buy is always too big in the cup because they NEVER have the right size for me, I found my 46B  here and it fit's perfectly!!"
5.0,"This tray looks very nicely made with care and quality. From all accounts it feels, smells and looks like real leather which it claims.  It is a matte leather so not too glossy not too dull. It has a nice subdued grain. The tray we got has a soft tan suede on the interior trays. It is all well made. The box it comes in was a nice blue box that has silver embossed &#34;Royce&#34; on it for Royce Leather and inside is a card explaining the company product and that is a nice touch . This valet beats the &#34;fake leatherette&#34; valets that are a dime a dozen and look cheap such as totes etc. The price is worth it despite being about 20 more than the leatherette ones. There was a tiny tiny tiny area of visible leather or fabric, but nothing major. It was just a slight area that had been glued or cut a centimeter too small. It is hand made it seems.  I see the product says Brookstone on the listing, but I didn't see that in any of the  documents. Other than that, the 18 year old we're giving to this will be very please with this adult looking but sleek styled grown up gift for his new stage in life."
5.0,Great haven't used them yet out on the road but I am very tall and slim. 6'5... And the length is perfect under riding pants. I chose the extra large and it's a little bulky. Can't beat the price tho! Get these if you're on a budget or just want to try something new.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ac9456b22b011f9bd0fa3c324f83a6dd]]This Yahoho leather wristlet wallet looks even more gorgeous in person than it does online, and it feels very soft and luxurious. I measured it to be 8.25&quot; L x 4.5&quot; H x 1&quot; wide, which makes it a spacious enough to hold an iPhone 6+, but still comfortable to carry by hand if you didn't want to use the wristlet attachment.<br /><br />It comes nicely presented in a dust cover inside a gift box that has a pretty polka dot and bow design. There is a mild new leather smell when you first remove it (which I happen to like), but it dissipates fairly rapidly once aired out for a day. The polishing, oiling, and waxing of the top grain leather results in beautiful patina that's glossy and buttery feeling, and also gives the wallet a high end look.<br /><br />It is solidly constructed with contrasting thread and gold tone hardware that compliments the leather which is true in color to the product picture. This wallet has enough compartments to easily store money, my cell phone, Id card, store cards, bank cards, credit cards and then some, and it's the first wallet I've had where the card slots are actually the right depth for the cards and not too deep.<br /><br />The outside of the wallet has a 7&quot; x 2.75&quot; zippered compartment for keys or other small items I want quick access too, and like the inside of the wallet, it's lined in a very attractive satiny feeling brown colored material with angled gold and black stripes. The zipper is well stitched in, has an attractive gold and leather pull, and opens and closes smoothly.<br /><br />The main compartment has a sturdy zipper that functions well and also has an attractive gold and leather pull. The inside is also lined in the same beautiful satiny material, and there are an impressive amount of compartments and slots for cards (9 card slots and one transparent ID slot). There's a slot for bills on the back with slots for six cards in front of it, followed by an open sleeve for receipts or cell phone, a zippered compartment for change, followed by the see through ID card holder, three more card slots, another open sleeve, and finally another zippered storage compartment on the front inner wall.<br /><br />The number of storage compartments and card slots this wallet has provide me with more than enough places to organize everything I need to carry, and it all looks and feels very well made. This is a beautiful wallet that is intelligently designed, practical, a nice size to carry, and it should provide many, many years of use.<br /><br />This wristlet wallet was provided at no cost by the manufacturer for evaluation and review."

5.0,"Unlike the few,<br />Very happy with the mines<br /><br />I walk everywhere and i work at a ramen shop where i run back and forth<br /><br />Necklaces holds up i can adjust<br /><br />Sometimes it loosens and goes down further but thats when i move quickly, i don't care i like it at any adjustment tbh<br /><br />And noticed felt strange when i held it and idk if this is chance but recently got a raise after two years working never wore one of these at all<br /><br />More positive  than usual battle with alot of things trauma growing up ghetto areas, bullied school home. Abused , rejection lol you name it<br /><br />I make humor of it because thats how I deal anyway<br /><br />I train i meditate with chakra crystals<br /><br />I wear a monk bracelet (i got from a traveling monk)to remind myself when something gets me heated to remember to be calm (i look up to bruce lee and respect shaolin) so<br /><br />This necklace was the first thing i got and felt good<br /><br />I appreciate the work going into this especially with all that is going on your doing  a positive thing selling these.<br /><br />I really don't have anything negative to even think to say im satisfied<br /><br />Thank you 🙏🏾"
5.0,"Great slip on shoes, perfect for running out to check the mail or watering the yard in the morning. Warm and comfortable, would buy aging if needed, I hope they last."
5.0,I love this not to small or not to big just right for me. Thank you.

5.0,Loved it got so many compliments
5.0,"Totally love this ring!!! True to size and very comfortable, especially for its size"
5.0,I was surprised on how durable they are
5.0,"Overall, the size of this clutch was the biggest downfall -- it was a bit larger than I expected and that isn't really my style, but I can see how this would be a great fashion statement for a fashionista. I wanted to return the product due to its size but I would have have to pay for shipping back so the seller suggested giving me 1/2 credit back so I didn't have to go through the trouble of sending it back. I was actually pretty happy with this arrangement and found it to be good costumer service! The item is cute -- but I probably won't use it often so paying a lower price seemed like a good deal to me!"
5.0,I love these earrings and Carol Jewelry is a fantastic seller! This is a must buy! Great quality.
5.0,This piece is beautiful to me.  It is in memory of my beloved❤️Dog who died recently.
5.0,"This is genius to have this for cold football, soccer, baseball, etc games!  I have worn it quite a bit and holding up well!!  I will say mediums are typically a little looser on me and almost went smaller since you’d want the warmth to be close to your body but I’m glad I did not get any smaller!  Size up vs down."
5.0,"When I first opened the package I thought they were going to be too big. However, I tried a pair on and they are perfect!! They are so comfortable. I work from home so I am going to have to order more so I can wear a pair everyday!"
5.0,Cute as can be. My grandson loves them. One month into the season and holding up well.
5.0,"Very cute, fits well and is good quality for the price. I’m happy with this purchase"
5.0,It is smaller than I expected. The echeting is well done .<br />For the cost I would recommend it.
5.0,"Really good quality leather and the hardware is oversized and sturdy. Not really an elegant strap, but it's great for a more rugged look. I definitely recommend"
5.0,i love this coat i live in canada so it gets cold here coat is nice and warm glad i bought it nice and heavy too
5.0,Perfect fit for the size. Included a tool to adjust just in case. My son loved it and said it was comdortable.

5.0,You can't match the price for this watch. My nephew swims with it and uses it often. It works great.
5.0,"Great makeup bad, lots of space, the bottom holds a lot of makeup brushes which is great to have the brushes separate, and the top part where the makeup goes is spacious and holds a lot items. It zippers nicely as well."
5.0,This was perfect!! And it has a zipper in the rear for easier access to go potty.

5.0,I really like my purse
5.0,"I prefer cardigans in case of hot flashes but often they want to fall off my shoulders or stay too open.  This takes care of that problem and is really attractive, kind of extra jewelry.  I bought other types as well and I know I'll be using them all but this will probably be my favorite."
5.0,She is going to LOVE IT!
5.0,I love this watch! I thought it might be hard to tell the time on it with the stones but it's no problem.  Very comfortable and a great size even though I have a very small wrist. I get compliments on it all the time.
5.0,LOVE!! I’m 5’10 and it was perfect length for me!! The material is perfect and not too thick or thin. I usually wear a 14/16 in pants and the xl fit perfect.
5.0,LOVE THIS MASK. WHAT A HANDSOME BABY!
5.0,Runs at least one size small but it has some room to stretch. You can wear this to a nice dinner or a casual day around town. I normally wear XL and got 2xl and its perfect.
5.0,"Love this top, i bought two. Very flattering"
5.0,This product is ideal for the shoulder surgery patient!  It fit well and was so easy to use!  Plenty of strategically-placed snaps to allow for quick and easy wearing and removing when needed!
5.0,Great looking and fits good
5.0,I get a lot of compliments with this top. It's light weight and goes well with so many things. Would recommend.
5.0,Love this band. So much nicer than silicone because it doesn't seem sweat. The velcro is so much nicer than a buckle.
5.0,"Really good product, good price, great waterproof quality. No doubts, ... buy them."
5.0,I am so pleased with how quickly the item arrived! The necklace is absolutely beautiful. It's something with a vintage look at a very affordable price. I'm hoping it lasts a while!!
5.0,I love the coverage and the way they fit. I have a small nose with high cheek bones and they fit perfect.
5.0,My son loves his and we’ve already ordered an extra
5.0,Beautiful and nicely packaged
5.0,Takes abit to come in the mail but is decent quality for a simple pin banner. I really have no complaints and it’s great for the price. Looks just like the photo
5.0,"Super flattering, I prefer the neckline to set below the breasts. Dress it up or down."
5.0,I received so many compliments on this dress. I was worried that it wouldnt fit properly. I'm curvy & the dress was flattering without drawing too much attention to my curves.
5.0,It has been hard working with a  mask while wearing glasses because they are constantly fogged.  This fog spray has been a life saver and has made work a lot more productive.
5.0,I love that it's portable and cordless  and can travel with me.  It's there when i need it. .....awesome!
5.0,"We put these in stockings for 5 kids in the family plus a few adults. My bright green and yellow one stayed on for 3 days (I washed around it and even lightly on top after sweating) even with going to the dentist (the hygienist thought it was hilarious) and going on 2 runs (5.5 miles on day 2 and 3 miles on day 3). The toddler wore 2 and was disappointed when their ""mush"" had fallen off in their sleep. I highly suggest it for fun, especially with kids."
5.0,"Very nice material,feels great,very comfortable,and looks flattering"
5.0,"They were as advertised,  very pleased with purchase"
5.0,This is a lovely piece. It's actually larger than you think it will be.<br />I bought it as a gift and the recipient loves it.
5.0,"For years these have been my favorite glasses and I’m so glad Oakley still makes it.  Over the years I have lose a couple pairs and one of those happenstances occurred recently.  However, there was no worry I was able to replace them with the exact same product.  I have retina problems and these are the only sunglasses that  do not let any light in."
5.0,Hubby love it!!!<br />It is comfortable and easy to put on to take off 😉
5.0,"My Daughter's really like these skirts. 5'5"" 125 to 130lbs and the medium fits great. If you want to wear these skirts high rise the waist then can be too big, however, I use a safety pin on the inside to tighten if needed. The size small was a bit too snug in waist, medium fits better."
5.0,I love how they feel but they are a little tight at the bottom of the capris
5.0,This purse wallet is so convenient and great quality
5.0,Got this as a gift to give a huge Tom Brady fan. She loved it!
5.0,Im very happy with my purchase

5.0,Super quality. Just as described. Great price for what you get!
5.0,Gorgeous colors and very nice material
5.0,Beautiful dress and fits great
5.0,This is a very well put together belt.  I'm not sure why real leather belts that look good are so hard to find.  I need to order another one in black.
5.0,It's a small drone! But goes good!
5.0,Awesome umbrella! Love it! I recommend highly that you buy a heavy base at the same time so you can enjoy without fear of it tipping over...very happy with it
5.0,cost effective
5.0,Beautiful real authentic amethyst. Thank you.
5.0,I usually buy a lot of things from Pretty Garden and they are true to size but this was not. Had to return it.
5.0,My second pair. Love the fit.
5.0,It lit up beautifully. Its gorgeous dress and all the lights works perfectly
5.0,"Very pretty lace.  I ordered a medium because I heard they ran small.  It fits, it's just a tad loose.  I'm a 32B."
5.0,Among my favorite socks.
5.0,"Very pretty and just perfect for St. Patrick's Day.  I wear it at other times too, but it is just sooooo.....perfect for St. Patrick's Day."
5.0,Love how it made my watch look expensive.
5.0,To go over my sleeveless sun dress.
5.0,"Great, sturdy top for the price!  Love it.  After reading some of the comments regarding the collar, I decided to just simply fold it down in half like you would a polo or dress shirt.  Looks fine. I'll be wearing it more as the weather cools down.  Cute with jeans or leggings!!!"
5.0,The colors were a little faded and the stones moved a lot. I am still giving it 5 stars because it is cute but perhaps I just got a defective item.
5.0,"Today is my first day wear them to play ping-pong,it's tight but comfortable,very good supporting on my foot."
5.0,This shirt is amazing !! Super comfortable . I wish they had more colors !!
5.0,I got so many compliments on this dress. The quality is well made! I am 5'1 130lbs and the small fit perfectly! I wouldn't mind having this dress in all the colors!
5.0,Really cute and stylish I love how it gives to an amazing cause!!!!
5.0,Amazing hat
5.0,Just as pictured1
5.0,Es lo que esperaba
5.0,These have become my go-to pants for work!  Very comfortable and legging-like (but not shear anywhere).
5.0,"Awesome value, very stylish, nice comfort"
5.0,Great quality and beautiful meaning.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:a52014f9ed81c1c6eca6dcdf8363702b]] Brazalete mas fino wow me encanta 😍 porfa necesito un case también color tornasolado
5.0,I liked how it fits
5.0,Much better quality than the past couple of band shirts I've bought from Amazon. Size is spot on for a  6'1&#34; 215-pound adult
5.0,Good quality construction. Appropriate light weight fabric. Comfortable.
5.0,I ordered these pants and another style. They fit perfectly and look very cute. I would recommend them if you want something cute and unique.
5.0,Like these!
5.0,"The product was exactly as the description, simple and elegant with a sturdy, carabiner-style, key ring. My wife really likes the color and I enjoy knowing her keys won't fall off and into a gutter."
5.0,They look great and sleek. not to big a nice size cuff link
5.0,Love the design and adjusts perfectly
5.0,The masks worked out just great..
5.0,"Nice and comfy socks! They are soft and not the least bit itchy like some wool socks. I love the vintage patterns - I machine washed and dried them and they came out fine (directions say to hand wash and line dry). I also love that they are warm, not too warm and not too thick as some wool socks are, I definitely recommend these socks!"
5.0,Very well made product.
5.0,"If these boxers would've been the correct size, my grandson would love them.  I will be purchasing the same styles in Small so he can wear them.  The material is very light and seems comfortable. The designs are very cool."
5.0,Love this dress. I generally wear a snug size 12. I'm a full-figured woman; 5'3&quot; and 180-185 lbs. with 36DD chest and a big butt and thighs. I ordered a large. It fits snug down to the top of my thighs but comfortable. I don't have to worry about buying spanx. I'm wearing a 3&quot; heel and the dress doesnt drag. The dress is great quality and not itchy. The &quot;V&quot; neck isn't too low. It's a very classy looking dress. Note: I don't recommend this dress if you have a big belly. It won't fit right if at all over your stomache and will draw attention to your belly.
5.0,"I bought a size medium, I am 5ft 7 inches and 160 lbs. Very flattering and comfortable. These are even more comfortable than their gym shark counterparts at half the cost. The material is thick such that it’s squat proof, however light enough to be so comfortable and non-restrictive. I have almost every color. The only possible downfall would be that sweat shows up in the lighter colors, however that doesn’t bother me at all-if you're working out, you should be sweating in my opinion :D"
5.0,"Soft, very comfortable & work on my phone 😁👍🏼"
5.0,These are legit. I've never felt so comfortable in underwear until now. I'll most likely be buying another pair again soon.
5.0,"Fits great, very soft, I can't wait for cooler weather so I can wear it!"
5.0,"This is adorable! Very soft and fuzzy.  Got a large for a teen 5'3&#34; and 125 pounds and it's just the right amount of baggy.  We got it for Halloween, but she's used it as pajamas almost every night."
5.0,Just bought the moon and sun bracelets and love them! The quality is fantastic.. smooth shiny mirror leather and the two prettiest Swarovski Chrystal’s. Can’t waitnto add to my collection! Kudos to the artist. And a bonus was the cool packaging. They make a great gift as well.<br />Thanks! So happy to have found these beautiful leather pieces.
5.0,Nice watch band. I like the way it looks.
5.0,They feel great to wear all day.
5.0,"Let me start off by saying that my glasses are super light with a titanium wireframe.  Long gone are those frustrating days where I have to keep pushing my glasses back up on my nose every couple of minutes because they keep sliding down.<br /><br />Easy to install.  To adjust your glasses where you want them to stay on your nose, After you have installed these and put your glasses on, just slide the retainers at the same time until your glasses reach their desired position.  That said, these retainers keep my glasses in place; period."
5.0,"Hello, I ordered a size small and Im 5'3 at 125lb and 32c this dress fits great!!! The color is vibrant and just as it is pictured by the seller. The fabric the skirt is made of is thick and smooth, def a great quality! Even the top of the dress seem well constructed (not thin or cheaply made). I would highly recommend this to all of my friends!"
5.0,Love this dress! To me me looks more expensive than the price you pay. Loved it so much ordered another in a different color. Very versatile dress. Can be worn for many different occasions. And very comfortable. Just check the size chart for your measurements and order accordingly.
5.0,"The only questionable item on the bag for me was the ""leather"" detail, I don't believe it is sold as ""leather"" and it's a good thing, it could be better. otherwise this is a great bag, and very good that it comes in 2 different sizes.  I love it"
5.0,Soft cotton fabric. Seems to hold the color a as shape after several washes. I love it.
5.0,My neice loves it for her new little baby!! Thank you...
5.0,"This is SUCH a fabulous dress. It's the first I've ever owned that I can go without a bra and be comfortable (I'm a 38DD). Plus it's so cute. I pair it with my petticoat to give it lots of fluff. It came a little wrinkled, but that's to be expected with shipping."
5.0,"It was somewhat tighter than expected for me even after sizing up to a medium, but not a problem. Glad I read other reviews and went up. I LOVE this suit! Really great quality for the price :)"
5.0,"Amazing comfort,  support, and style. Love Saxx so much! Will be ordering more!"
5.0,"They do what they are supposed to. I was hoping to use it for a different purpose, but the end was a little thicker than I expected. Not a design defect."
5.0,I ordered this hat for my daughter’s softball game and it arrived the next day. Comfortable and cute.
5.0,Nice looking and good quality product. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,Excelente artículo lo recomiendo 100%
5.0,"This was cute<br />Fabric was soft, seams were sturdy and clean. I didn’t wash it so I don’t know how it washes . But I did feel like it was good quality.<br /><br />I didn’t like how it looked on me.. so I did return it. But it had nothing to do with the quality"
5.0,This. Is. Awesome.<br />First time out of the house with it and already a dozen comments. The Carbon fibre design really sticks out in the light which makes it even more attractive and stylish. Easy access to my cards so no more struggling and fumbling with my old big wallet. I don't use folded bills in the middle. Instead I used an external battery the size of a credit card and surprisingly it fits too. On top of that I have managed to fit 2 cards in each slot and the wallet has still managed to hold its integrity. Amazing and a must have for any one who loves cars or Carbon fibre or both!
5.0,"High quality, LOOKS AND FEEL GREAT!"
5.0,We bought these as house shoes for our daughter. She absolutely loves them! They are so comfy!!
5.0,"I love watches, so this did not disappoint. A bit larger than I usually wear. But I  love just the same"

5.0,It also keeps great time.
5.0,I received these bangle and they are beautiful. They are solid and I love the sound of them together. You can wear only one and it's still look good.  I would recommend these if you like big bangle

5.0,I bought the hematite adjustable bracelet and loved it so much I bought the hematite and tourmaline adjustable bracelet two weeks later. They are really well made and priced so fairly I could buy two of them!! I wear them everyday and have gotten complements on them. I only take them off when I workout and take showers. They really are pretty. I actually bought another one to give as a gift. I’m very happy with these bracelets.
5.0,"Did not have to remove any links.  Perfect fit for my small wrist.  If you like to wear different watches, try this one.  It is definitely a conversation piece and it's cute and casual.  Keeps time good!"
5.0,My daughter is 5 and I bought 6x. Perfect size. She has long arms and this fits really good on her. It's not bulky either. She loves it.
5.0,"Fit as expected and Comfortable to wear, I love it !It’s good deal for the price ! Fast delivery! Thank you !"
5.0,Perfect for the gym! Pockets could be a little deeper.
5.0,"The only complain I have is that they only had 1 color available for my size (L) otherwise I would have ordered all the other colors. These shorts are a nice hybrid of casual and gym so they look good with a gym tank or a polo shirt.<br /><br />I'm 5'5"", 189 lbs, stocky muscular build and L fit perfect."
5.0,"He loves his shirt, I’ve washed a few times and it looks good"
5.0,"It comes unhooked between the stones a lot and needs to be rehooked. It’s a Beautiful, sparkly wrist band."
5.0,My son loves his new “bright” sneakers. They’re lightweight and the Velcro stays in place.<br />Sizing was as expected.
5.0,When I put this dress on I felt sexy it covered the rolls & belly well I recently got to relaxed & let myself get comfortable in Love... but it did me justice to celebrate my Hubby’s birthday he Loved the dress couldn’t keep his hands off my derrière (LoL)

My behind is covered n doesn't ride up.. nice n snug under the cheeks.. the stripes hide my post baby stomach perfectly and since i don't like to show my back this covers great..i highly recommend this one piece.. really love ❤️ it more than 5 stars .. just wish stripes would go all around .. would by from this seller again.
5.0,"Nice quality, buy larger than expected, should order one size down"

5.0,Fit very well and stay in place.
5.0,Comfort and warm
5.0,Perfect overall
5.0,We visited Ireland last year which turned out to be the trip of a lifetime. These earrings evoke such wonderful memories. They are made with Conamara marble which you can only get in Ireland and they are shamrocks which are iconic Ireland without making you immediately start taking like a Luck Charms commercial.
5.0,Very pretty and comfortable on the finger
5.0,Got it for my mom for Christmas. She loved it! The packaging was very pretty. Also it is real gold...not gold plated. Looks pretty much like the picture. This is a lovely present for others or for yourself. Simple and beautiful.
5.0,LOVE! Little see through but thats ok
5.0,Love the fir and comfort.
5.0,These leggings fit perfect! they are super soft and super comfortable!
5.0,Love this necklace! Have received many compliments! Would recommend getting this piece!
5.0,This was a spontaneous purchase knowing she LOVES PURPLE but what a winner!  Since Christmas she has not taken it off!  Durable and pretty she will love it!
5.0,Very breathable....just what I was looking for.
5.0,"So cute! The fabric is stretchy, but holds its form well. No sagging. Fit great. It's definitely more of a cropped look, which looks cute with sandals. The fabric is a little scratchy, but didn't bother me at all. I normally order a small, but sized up to a medium, and it fit perfectly. I'm 5'4 and 128lbs for reference."
5.0,"Really pretty,  silky smooth robe. I've had mine about 6 months now and it's held up well. Very happy"
5.0,"Llllllllllove these pups!<br />They look awesome, feel and fit great! Non see-through (which is kind of important to me). Very comfortable. Stretch perfectly well!<br />I ordered them in purple. Will definitely order them in black, too!<br />These pants just me happy and make me not want to take them off.<br />Very good quality. And the price is just to laugh at!)"
5.0,"This is a really nice pair of water shoes! My son has slightly wider feet, so he can be picky about shoes... Especially if he has to wear them without socks! Luckily he has found these to be incredibly comfortable!!! He even keeps asking to wear them to school over his regular shoes, lol. They feel all made and like they will last the summer. I would recommend them!"
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:d0dbb6cb6aa911ed0448a3e2b484970b]] Bought a size Medium and it fits well.  The material feels a bit thin but it does have some stretch.  The top front of the dress definitely highlights your boobs so you may have to pin it for work or wear a jacket but overall, I liked it and the front split."
5.0,Bought for my daughter. She loves it! It fits her perfectly.
5.0,Good price for a nice shirt
5.0,It was a gift for my mother but she seems to really like it.  It was heavier/warmer than another one I gave her.
5.0,Love them!!! Great deal as well!!
5.0,"I was looking for something better fitting then the disposable masks. This is fits pretty well and ear loops are comfortable. The fit isn't as tight as the Niosh mask for reference, but is worth what you are paying. Likely to purchase again."
5.0,As described perfect fit
5.0,"This little number is beautiful! Form fitting, falls right below the knee and has cute bow to tie at neck! A vintage retro feel so cute, love it!"
5.0,"I had my forward helix pierced, but the first jewelry I had was very snaggy, it wasn’t smooth like these. I had so many issues because it snagged EVERYTHING... my hair, towels, shirts, the q-tips for cleaning, etc. Then I found these on Amazon and switched it out and it has been SO much better. They are sparkly and pretty. I love them. I have a set in my bottom first hole as well so it matches. Comfortable and no issues with the metal. I’ve had this in for about two months with no issues, and my piercing has healed so much better.  I plan to use these if I ever pierce any more!"
5.0,grand daughter loves it...
5.0,Great plugs for the price. No issues whatsoever. Get them if you're in the market.
5.0,"I  absolutely love this dress. It’s very simple and comfortable yet really great looking. I like simple comfortable clothes that look classy. I am 5’9” tall  and 150 pounds  wasn’t sure if I should order a medium or large… I ended up going for the large ... It’s very long but  not too long, not dragging on the floor ... and it’s perfect!  I’m thinking about ordering several more."
5.0,Perfection if your a D or DD this might be wayyyyy to small
5.0,Easy to put on and take off.
5.0,"The material is great, soft like satin. It fits great and covered my stomach which is what I always try to do. It was just hard trying to find a shirt to go with it as a t-shirt would only showcase my bulging belly. So, I'm still in search but if you can do a tuck in, go for it. You will love it! You can wear it in the day or night."
5.0,Much nicer than I expected.  For the price it's an awesome ring.  Very sparkly.
5.0,Great bag for traveling and perfect space for a tablet
5.0,Beautiful and light
5.0,"I ordered a large on this dress, it fits perfect my measurements are 32 double D bus and my waist is 31 inches it is a nice fit for me the skirt is like 2ft long it is super comfy the four buttons are sewed on very well all the stitching/mending is very well very sturdy no fading no chemical smells it was very well packaged and it was shipped superfast I would definitely recommend the stress if you're doing like the 50s nights  sometimes a group of us get dressed and go to dinner and often in a town next to us we have plays and we all dress up I would recommend this dress to anyone looking for a 50s dress it's so comfy and nice fitting I did get this for discounted price as a sample for my honest review"
5.0,My Granddaughter loved this shirt.
5.0,Delivery info. Quality of service.  Great!!!!
5.0,"exactly what i wanted, i wear them every day and ive had them fir two years now"
5.0,"Great gloves. Only pricy because they look good but that wasn't why I wanted them. Make an uglier pair with the same quality for less money, please."
5.0,exlent
5.0,My 5 & 7 yr olds love these. Good quality and fit
5.0,"This ring is so beautiful, I ordered it for my wife and she she love it so much.<br />And the seller is so supportive.<br />Happy with the product ans services/"
5.0,Love aviators for work but am always breaking or losing them.  Bought these for the price.  Pretty awesome for about 2 bucks a pair!
5.0,"Love these earings, they match the necklace I got at the SanDiago zoo perfectly."
5.0,They are very pretty and can be seen despite long curly dark hair. They look beautiful when paired with a rose gold necklace.
5.0,Purchased to go with my bracelet.  It matches the color perfectly. I love it
5.0,Perfect shirt for universal studios
5.0,Such a pretty mask!!! Good quality
5.0,The length my husband likes compares to boarding shorts
5.0,I love the color on my Apple Watch
5.0,Perfect and shipped fast
5.0,"Warm and cozy, which is why I bought it!  Glad to have a comfortable, soft hoodie at such a reasonable price for a big guy!"
5.0,Very pleased with the beautiful handcrafted earrings!! The personal note was very nice too...I will definitely order more from this seller!! I would recommend!!!
5.0,Love this dress. It easy to care for and freely flo with the wind.
5.0,"Love it, very sturdy!  Lots of pockets!!"
5.0,Their cute and the large fit me perfect. So yeah you do have to go a size up bc they do run small but i love it! I think even the mediumwould look cute for booty shorts at home.
5.0,Fast and professional. Great product
5.0,Bought for a gift product quality met my expectations.
5.0,"My son loves pandas. No, I mean he REALLY REALLY REALLY obsesses over pandas. Does he love this shirt? Does a panda poop in the forest? I don't know if he's ever (!) going to take it off.<br /><br />He loves pandas 😳"
5.0,"I love this light, it's great for walking my dogs.  I walk my dogs early in the morning and it helps me see and be seen and I don't have to worry about bugs in my face light the ""head"" lights.  I walk 1 & 1/2 hours every morning and charge it every other day and no issues.  I paid a lot more for other lights that didn't stay charged as long and didn't last, this comes with a one year warranty which is nice (just in case)  Highly recommend!"
5.0,Super cute on my daughter. A little big for her head (she’s 15 months) but she’ll grow into them
5.0,The quality of these sweats are great.  The elastic waist band makes for a very comfortable fit. They are made of 8% spandex so the fabric has some stretch to it. The two side pockets are very convent.  These sweats are suitable for any athletic event and then still look good enough to wear out on the town. We really like the tapered legs on these pants as it makes for a nicer look. The run true to size and laundry well.  I would highly recommend these sweats.
5.0,I liked that the scarf was exactly as described and didn't look cheaply made.
5.0,I like wearing these shoes. I have them on right now.
5.0,"These sleep n' plays have been great for my newborn.  They're comfortable, durable, and cute.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers that they run small.  Based on those reviews, I ordered size 3-6 months for my 3 week old, 7 lb 11 oz baby and they fit well, especially since we use cloth diapers, which are bulkier."
5.0,i got these shoes for my best friend for her birthday! when they came in i took them out and looked at them! they were baby pink and extremely gorgeous! im jealous i didnt get a pair for myself! she came to pick them up the day after i got them and couldnt believe how beautiful they were in person (they look way better in person then online) i would definitely recommend these!
5.0,It’s super beautiful!! My daughter love it.
5.0,Fits nicely and keeps accurate time.  Not bad for thirty bucks.  A little bigger diameter than I expected but it's thin.
5.0,"I love these masks. The adult fits me like a glove (for my face) and just fits my 6'5 son. The ear straps with adjustable slides are comfortable for all day wear and the filter pocket holds a PM 2.5 carbon filter perfectly. These are definitely thick at three layers plus filter, but I feel more secure in them. There are no cheek gaps and the metal fitted nose piece is sturdy and holds it's shape.  I'm ordering more and there will be at least one in everyone's stocking this year. Finally a fantastic mask at a great price in cute patterns or plain. These are perfect."
5.0,"This hat fits me perfectly.  Most are too skimpy, but this one is wonderful.  So warm, as well!"
5.0,So awesome came with extra stones!! Great quality fast shipping! Would definitely purchase again
5.0,I love this purse. Great for the price and just the right size. It was exactly as describe and works for me. Love the color. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0,Great fit and I love the material! Bought it in a second color!
5.0,"They are colorful and bright.  The quality that has impressed me the most, besides the great price, is that the white paint in the debossed characters still looks brand new!  I rarely take them off, and the paint has survived two years of showers and handwashing. They're also good conversation starters.<br /><br />Thanks to the business owners for providing such a nice product."
5.0,"This bag is amazing, I'm so in luv with it.<br />I get so many compliments"
5.0,"Well made, comfortable and attractive product.  Good purchase!"
5.0,Very relaxing dress I love it.
5.0,"Perfect, exactly the same!!!!"
5.0,Got these for my son to wear under his soccer uniform & he says they are very comfortable!
5.0,"On time, as advertised"
5.0,Bought for a craft project and these were perfect.
5.0,We used them for a nerf party and it was exactly what I needed...fast shipping no issues.
5.0,Like the skull design lets others know I'm dangerous lmao!
5.0,Awesome piece
5.0,"Ooomaaa! The stitching isn’t great, but you have to choose the right pattern and color, so it conceals the stitching. Other than that the dress fits like a glove. You can definitely size down. It has a nice stretch and feel. Super sexy! Can’t wait to wear this out! At the price point, can’t go wrong…Definitely recommend!"
5.0,These are wonderful. Using them as part of gift bag prizes for my daughter’s birthday.
5.0,"Do not hesitate on these! They are gorgeous! I wear a US8 so I got the 39. I would have gone up a size but I didn't want for them to become too big. The fabric of the shoe is woven so I can feel the stretch the more I wear them. The front of the shoe is stiff but I think it's so that the shoe will maintain its look, so it doesn't become too saggy with wear. I think it's a plus, but it is a little rough on the toes! Theses shoes, as with most need some breaking in! The picture does not do them justice at all and I'm glad I listened to the reviews and just ordered them. They would be way more expensive at a shoe store. They really look like boutique quality shoes, I was giddy when they arrived! Speaking of arriving, I ordered them Friday evening, got them the following Sunday!<br />Not only am I ecstatic over these shoes but they provide a level of customer service to match. I got a different style for my 10 year old daughter. I'm not ready to share shoes with her just yet! She is going from the kid shoe sizes to the adults. So we are not sure what exactly her size would be (I should have done more homework on that) so I got her the 36. She could not even get her feet into them. Crestfallen, I emailed the company, ready to ship it back at my own expense, whatever to get her the right shoes. I got an immediate response<br />from them. I responded, telling them what size is would like and expecting them to give me the shipping cost and the exchange process. In response to that, I got an email stating that they would just send me the correct size! Right?! This was a total error on my part ! My daughter's order was shipped just as quickly as mine, they did absolutely nothing wrong. I am still amazed! I know my daughter will be the only one at her school with these shoes so I was was more than willing to ship it back to them for a replacement. I love a company that takes care of their customers! I would absolutely recommend these and any other shoes they make. I know I'm buying myself more! They are affordable but they don't look cheap, stellar customer service. So,yeah get them!"
5.0,"Feels great to wear the ""All American"" patch on my chest!!"
5.0,Nice stretch. Buy 1 size smaller
5.0,"Adore this, its my firstt actual pajama set I've bought in my adult life and I am stoked. Soft, pretty good material. The top is a crop top, if you're not into that tho! However, I am tall so it could be just shorter on me. I'm 5'9, 125lbs and got a small, just so you know. But would recommend!"
5.0,"These sunglasses are a steal for the price!  They are stylish and lightweight.  I recently purchased several pair of sunglasses ( same vendor) and the  side pieces were so tight, I could only wear them for an hour before hada headache.  These have just right amount of tension, not too tight, not too loose."
5.0,"These are by far my favorite leggings (I got the Cheetah).  The feel great and look fabulous.  I do wish that the material wasn't nylon, because I have to be careful of snagging them.  My first pair got a a hole in them my first day wearing them. Fingers crossed these don't tear!!"
5.0,"This dress is so cute. I am wear size 8 and 5 3 , 150 lbs, I purchased size L and it fits perfectly. Very comfortable. I usually wear medium USA Size. Since this is China dress, I recommend you to buy a size larger."
5.0,Love these! Exactly what I ordered.
5.0,"These are surprisingly heavy. The description says 17grams but it seems more. I'm not really sure if I would consider these for daily wear, unless you are actively stretching to go bigger."
5.0,"I Love this style of dress. It is very flattering on me. I have seen many from various catalogs and I can tell you they were more than double the price. I had ordered a small first and it was too tight in the chest 36B/34C cup size, dress size 4. The medium looked much better. I love the color I picked, Apricot, I think. My sister said I looked washed out but I think it<br />is a nice color. Buy this dress!  After I returned the first I had the second it what seemed like only a couple days. Amazon is so fast."
5.0,"I absolutely love this dress!! I had to shorten it because I'm only 5 feet tall so everything I own needs altering. Otherwise, the fit was perfect, is very flattering, really comfortable, and you can dress it up or down. Officially my favorite item in my wardrobe. I highly recommend this dress!"
5.0,I was really excited to find the official lightstick online before we go to the concert this year! I selected the set that also included the mini-album. Very happy with this.
5.0,Got here quick!  Pretty!  Giving as gift.  May order more!
5.0,Great shoe. Use it for all occasions
5.0,Amazing tshirt
5.0,"I bought these to use in the car at fast food restaurants. Wife is wheel chair bound so we eat in the car a lot.  Work great, generous size,  ordered a second batch for when we launder them."
5.0,I like the color of the cap
5.0,comfortable.  light-weight.  Looks like they are well made.  The case for them is nice.
5.0,looks just just like it does in the picture and shipped pretty quickly.
5.0,Super Cute! Some I could fit as rings on my pinkie which was nice but great knuckle rings!! Just like the picture
5.0,"Good quality cream, not pumpable like I thought but a little goes a long way."
5.0,This is the most comfortable lanyard I've used in the 10+ years I've had to wear one.
5.0,Better than expected.  Soft and comfortable
5.0,Excellent quality. Glasses are really cool. For those who love big-sized sunglasses - this is for you
5.0,"Warm and fluffy and fit well. They are so cute, I love them!"
5.0,Love this suit! I ordered a size up and wore it all day scuba diving under my wetsuit and then on the beach. I suggest wearing a bikini top under it because the support is not great.
5.0,"These are so cute! They look great, they are small and SO pretty!"
5.0,Item looked in real life exactly as advertised. Bought for my MIL’s birthday and she LOVED it. So cute! Would buy again.
5.0,"Big fan of the show , this now of my favorite pieces"
5.0,"We did have tuxedo tailored for the slim fitted look of today however this could have been worn right out of package. Pants come unfinished giving you option to wear at any length, width, or style. The pattern on jacket is exceptional & the material of tuxedo is A1 quality. The craftsmanship left no detailed overlooked. For the price this is a definite steal. Will be buying from retail continuously for all formal wear. My son definitely was the Prince of the Ball thanks to you."
5.0,Amazing!! My wife love it! Now she want to buy another pair :)
5.0,Professional look.length is just over my knee. Good material and great cut. Cute should cuffs.true to frill or creases in skirt too:not straight and I'm built &#34;below&#34;<br />I'm a size 10-12<br />Comfortable to wear at work and quick to give professional look with just the dress.
5.0,Cute and very soft.
5.0,"fit well,"
5.0,"I love this Shvigel Leather Bracelet Phone Holder. This is one of my favorite phone accessories that I have ever gotten. First, the bracelet is definitely my style. I love the leather bracelet, it is adjustable and fits my wrist perfectly on the smallest setting. The awesome part where it morphs from a bracelet to a phone stand, is great. It is very sturdy on a flat surface. The cutouts are great, it fits my Samsung 5s with a case on it.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion. I only review products my family or I personally use."
5.0,I wear them everyday and quite comfortable.  At times I coordinate the color of the ring with a shirt or tie I'm wearing.  Fit is consistent with my ring size.
5.0,"These earrings well with everything which is always nice when you just want a little bling. Love how they catch the light and just like all other products with this company, very good quality. I will definitely continue to buy more pieces to add to my collection!"
5.0,Very cute simple dress. You can easily dress it up with a necklace. It is very see through though.
5.0,Bought it  for my daughter and she like it so much.
5.0,I recently purchased 2 pairs. I'm very happy to say they feel and fit great with some compression. I would compare them to old navy's elevate or powersoft. I am a size large in other brands so that is what I ordered fit great! squat proof high rise doesn't roll even when doing bur-pees. I ordered two prints in darker colors no show even when sweating if you know what I mean.<br />Barbara
5.0,It's a very pretty dress.  Fits well.  Received a lot of compliments.  Would order from this company again.
5.0,I haven't had my event yet so I haven't pressed the dress yet and am a little nervous about getting it to iron out well.  I did also get the petticoat with it. The dress does need the extra volume so I do recommend getting one with the dress.  It does make it super fun.
5.0,"Nice quality fabric, soft, stretchy, comfy! Great price, test shipping!  would definitely buy again"
5.0,"Soft, great fit, and cute looking"
5.0,Solid tag
5.0,A perfect fit! And just as dark as my eye doctor recommended!
5.0,Really nice GSD pendant
5.0,"Nice, cute earrings, shaped like a treble clef. Each of the two parts dangles from the post such that every once in a while they produce pleasant chiming sounds."
5.0,This product is well finished and appears to be made from quality materials. I fully expect to have this item for a very long time.
5.0,really liked them
5.0,Wear these all the time for yoga/work outs. Great for what they are
5.0,Good luck socks look great.  Purchased as a gift for someone studying to be a deep sea diver.  Thank you.
5.0,I bought these for a friend for her birthday. She loved them and what a steal for two pairs of earrings! They came nicely boxed and just as described. They do not look inexpensive. Perfect for someone that likes funky and fun earrings. They are large.
5.0,Perfect little skirt! Great skirt to walk the dogs in.
5.0,This jersey is way better than I was expecting. It feels very well stitched and rivals premium jerseys.
5.0,Got ten years out of the last pair!
5.0,We love spiral shirts
5.0,"Daughter loved it. Soft, comfy and cute!!"
5.0,Awesome. Beautiful watch. Big Star Wars fan.
5.0,"Very nice , comfortable t-shirt. love it"
5.0,"I love this shirt! I came across this gem, and had to have it. It's comfy and I got it much quicker than I expected."
5.0,"This wallet is so much better than my tri-fold leather wallet. That old wallet used to get all my cards very dirty and out of shape. I'm hoping that this new one won't do the same. The new wallet looks very nice, it makes my pockets less bulky, and it makes it much easier to retrieve my cards when I need to pay for things. The interior pockets can be very tight and hard to open, but at least I know that what I put in there won't fall out."
5.0,Comfortable mask. love the filters
5.0,"I wanted a thin, form-fitting athletic top to use in lieu of a tankini top. I don't like ruffled opened back tankini tops with patterns, etc. This was perfect snug & form fitting, but not too tight. Sheer but not completely see through, which didn't matter much to me because I just wanted some added modesty over my everyday bra. Very soft and smooth on my very sensitive skin. I find even smooth materials itchy when others don't. I was afraid i had snagged it a couple of times when I had accidentally touched rough or prickly items but when I looked it was fine so it's not too easily snagged either which makes it perfect for family beach trips when its hard to be careful. I'm very happy with this product and the price and would order 6 more if I could, to wear every day!"
5.0,a little light weight . one came in perfect condition the other had the battery paper tab removed before arriving. however i know my sons will love it and it was worth every cent .
5.0,Awesome bag! Perfect size!
5.0,I love this product very legit ppl think its real great quality this the best chain i bought on here
5.0,Love this scarf. Exactly as it was described!
5.0,Absolutely love these!! I wanted something that I can strap around my ankles & these worked perfect! Looks just like the picture & a wonderful price! Trying to now find it in another color❤
5.0,The girl that I gave this use it every day.
5.0,Like them lots
5.0,"They are true to size, comfortable, warm and have a firm sole for a indoor slipper. Also, they are quite rustic looking. It's tempting to not want to go out in them!"
5.0,This watch is unique. My daughter loves it
5.0,"I love this dress! It is very cute. It is nice because the small sleeves are not tight, which I often have troubles with in dresses that fit everywhere else. There is only one issue I have with this; the bust area is a bit tight (I included a picture). I almost need to wear an undershirt if I am to wear this to work because you will be able to see my skin and bra if I don't keep an eye on it. Otherwise, it fits perfectly everywhere else! Also, the material seems a bit different than I thought it was going to be, but I still like it. My measurements are 37.5, 28.5, 37. I am 5'5&#34; and 128lbs."
5.0,Wife was really pleased with this necklace
5.0,Bought these for under my scrubs as a dental assistant. Very comfortable
5.0,Liked it very much .. love sparkley masks
5.0,My husband loved his Father’s Day gift!
5.0,Excellent band. Doesn’t feel cheap.
5.0,"Bought a black and pink strap, 38mm love them both, comfortable to wear, look really nice, I have a very thin wrist, like the look of this thinner strap than Apple’s Original with my watch"
5.0,"Supportive, good quality, and cute!"
5.0,"These are my favorite glasses, they feel solid but aren't heavy.  They are much better than others I've spent a lot more money on."
5.0,"Love the fit & cut. Actually wear these for underwear.<br />Make sure you buy a size larger than what you normally wear.<br />I have a 29 inch waist, and normally wear small. I purchased the Medium,<br />and they fit perfect."
5.0,These bands are great! Very comfortable and super easy to install or change! We love the color choices and have 3 different colors right now. We probably add more.<br />Will suggest them to friends and family!<br />Thanks Barton!
5.0,"This lenses were a perfect fit for my rinconitios, I have had these for a couple weeks at this point and have used them at work, while weed eating, and also just stained a deck the lenses were covered it speckles of stain and they cleaned right up and have yet to scratched! Money well spent!!"
5.0,Really love this bra. One of my favorites. Super comfy and the straps don’t slip off ever nor dig into your shoulders.
5.0,"More of a red than burgundy color. All stitching is great. Super fast shipping, received within a week! Very impressed with this dress. I am 5'5 (ish) and it is just long enough to wear a short heel with a bit of a train effect. Purchased size 16 and it fits true to size and measurements."
5.0,"great deal,fast delivery,good quality product"
5.0,"I love these boots. I love Fit Flop. These are great with leggings or flare leg jeans/pants. I normally wear a wide-width shoe, but Fit Flops are roomy enough (run a tad big, which is good!) for me. In a perfect world all shoes would be a 10 1/2 wide or extra wide, however these boots in a 10 fit perfect! I love the squishy soles, with a little tread so they are safe in the winter, not slippery. The top opening is a little wider so you could wear warm socks and still squeeze my big feet into them. I cannot say enough good things about these booties. Highly recommended."
5.0,Work with oil as a machinist. So far so good
5.0,"Of course at the price I was worried it was gonna be crappy, but it’s nice so far. I love quick-release bands, and the leather feels nice; no peeling, no wrinkles so far, took a couple days to break in, but it feels nice now. And I love that it comes with a spring bar tool to get your old band off."
5.0,Beautiful piece. Great job with shipping and packaging.
5.0,gorgeous piece doesn't get lost between my breast like some smaller chains would.
5.0,Big wallet lots of room wife will love it on Christmas
5.0,Good quality & loved the graphics!  Very funny!!
5.0,Easy to install and is holding up well. I’ve used these for many months now with no issues. I have even worked out with the leather band these are on when I forgot to switch out to my rubber band.
5.0,"I must say, I am impressed! From the quality materials, to the functionality, and even the great product presentation; this is probably the best minimalist wallet I have put my hands on. I have been playing around with all the customization options, and different aesthetics, but no matter what configuration they have all seem to fit my needs. Also, I managed to fit 12 cards, plus some cash without a problem, I could easily fit more if I wanted. I want to add that their customer service stands by their satisfaction guarantee. They responded to all my questions expeditiously and took great care of me!"
5.0,Great stretch in the fabric! Loving the color and it's very comfortable
5.0,"This is my fifth pair of Hi-Tec Ravus hiking boots. They fit great. A little wider and more comfortable than Merrel, and they hold up really well. I went ahead and bought two pairs this time, because I knew I would want another , when these wear out."
5.0,Good quality and great price!
5.0,I have 5 of the short sleeve versions.  The long sleeve is just as good.
5.0,"Fits well length wise,  but I'm not a large chested lady and i don't fill it out as well as the model,  but it's still a lovely color and fairly dressy"
5.0,Used these on a trans-Atlantic flight and I loved them! They kept the swelling in my legs down.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:b212e6ac3dcf8953560e9e3b5ef07f8a]] Just what I wanted after getting covid 19 i needed something comfortable to wear
5.0,Was easy to cut and put back together at the exact right size.  Good price for a semi-good looking reversible belt.
5.0,Very pretty display item.  I put my grandmother's grandmother's pocket watch on display in this dome and it is lovely.  It came packaged really well;  am very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"Excellent, well made and arrived quickly. Normally I ware a large but runs a bit small, needed an XL."
5.0,I wanted to decorate my switch. It’s so cute .
5.0,"I wear this with a thick belt, great for work or going out in cool weather"
5.0,"Love these! Makes my boobs look great! Also, you have to place them very strategically, it took me like 5 times to get the position right. Stick with it, and you'll be buxom in no time."
5.0,I ordered this before the pandemic and just got it yesterday. This is for my 14 year birthday  picture she already loves it now it’s picture time
5.0,Es muy chico y la talla estaba bien
5.0,My 4 year old granddaughter loved these nightgowns. They are so soft and comfy.
5.0,Added stiffness to my hats
5.0,Awesome corset! Fits beautifully! Very good quality. Has real steal boning. I was very impressed with it.
5.0,This shirt is very flattering! It’s modest and sexy! My fiancé loved how it looked. It’s also well made and comfortable
5.0,Very diva-ish earrings! I like that they can be for your edgy or cute style of fashion! Lightweight and well made.

5.0,"GOOD DEAL, NICE GLASSES, GOOD SIZE FOR LARGER MEN . STURDY FRAMES, NICE STYLE..HAPPY..THANKS !"
5.0,"This is a great bag.  I hate carrying big, bulky heavy bags but when we take our granddaughter on an outing, I need to carry wipes, diapers, juice box.  This box is soft and has several pockets to keep things organized.  The inside is two separate zipped compartments so I can keep the kid's stuff in one, and mine in the other.  It's large enough for my iPad, along with the usual wallet, hairbrush, tissues, etc.  The outside pockets are perfect for house and car keys, earbuds, and my iPhone6 in its case.  The bag is light, and the shoulder strap is adjustable to use across the body, or can be removed easily to use the two attached straps.  There was NO bad smell at all...I was a little worried based on other reviews.  I cannot recommend this bag highly enough.  And the price is exceptional for something so nice.  I didn't get any discount for this review; paid full price."
5.0,"I needed a bag that was rugged and small, but big enough for my cell phone, and that could be used cross body or round my waist for security when hiking or for general use. I found this on Amazon at least a couple of years ago and used it every day. It was perfect and durable. Eventually the light inside material started to give way due to its age and the amount of use. The rest of the bag was still perfect after much use and abuse! I seached Amazon and found the original product so bought another two so I will never be without this bag!"
5.0,I loved the sandals! I was trying to find a sandal that was comfortable and I could wear socks with. I wear these sandals everywhere. The soles of the sandal is so soft.
5.0,Very nice quality nightie with sweet little purple lace accents. It is very soft and comfortable and still looks great after many launderings. Our little girl loves it!
5.0,"Not lined, but this is my new favorite dress. I wish it was a little longer in the arms and hem, but not a mini skirt like so many other dresses are.<br />Fits like a dream."
5.0,"Bought these as part of the bridesmaids jewelry and they are outstanding. Simple, elegant and cheap. Perfect with a rose gold necklace and bracelets."
5.0,Xmas gift for my son  he was happy with it thanks..
5.0,"I just love it, because i can fit all my hair in there and is super confortable."
5.0,I have a big head (no other way to say it)--these are lightweight and fit really well without pressing into my head. Polarized but not too dark. Came with a zippered case that I wasn't expecting but am really pleased with as well because it's large enough to be versatile with other glasses as well.
5.0,"Although I have not used the bag yet, I received it the other day.  The studs and floral detail are blackish-pewter, exactly as shown in the photo.  What you can't see in the photo are three things that make this bag absolutely stellar.  First, the flower accent..  In the photo, it appears flat and flush with the fabric.  It's not!  It's slightly raised, VERY 3-dimensional, and substantial feeling!  It looks as if it could be used as a hair clip or even a jewelry-type pin/broach.  Second, the fabric itself.  It's a nice satin, and more importantly, it's finished properly.  I can't count how many times I've bought an inexpensive bag or shawl, only to find exposed seams or fraying bits sticking out.  The internal lining on this bag is tucked away properly.  And finally, the shoulder chain.  I have a few evening bags with shoulder chains, and when you want to just use the bag as a clutch, you stuff the chain into an inadequate little pocket inside the bag.  It always slips out of the little pocket and is rattling around inside the bag.  Other bags have crappy hook and eyes for linking the shoulder chain in place -- eventually the hook stretches out of shape and the bag is falling off the chain.  Not this one!  It actually uses a lobster claw clasp to secure the shoulder chain to a sewn in metal circle (can't remember the word for this), just as you would fasten a necklace.  The chain itself is thin, but decently made... I don't foresee it breaking while being used.  I bought this bag for a formal function, and it can easily hold my phone, lipstick, tin of mints and a tissue or two, with room to spare - yet it's sleek and streamlined.<br /><br />To summarize, excellent value, extremely attractive, well made.  I'm VERY glad that I purchased this bag."
5.0,gave this as a gift and the quality was amazing. looked just like a name brand necklace
5.0,"This belt is fantastic for running in the mornings when it is still dark.  It adjusts easily, and is bright enough to light up the ground in front of me."
5.0,So adorable
5.0,Good deal and well made productGood deal and well made product
5.0,This is a great product. I like the thinness of the band. It looks more feminine. The quality looks good. I hope it lasts a long time.
5.0,I got this to make into a poodle skirt for Halloween. It's well made and pretty. I may order more in other colors since it will go well with a blouse and sweater for work.
5.0,"Super, soft and looked great! Made my Halloween outfit complete!"
5.0,"I had a different dress on today with these earrings, but the dress that I had picked was a little shorter. Currently I am having some issues with my legs so I have been using a walker and a wheelchair. So the other dress would ride up as a sat. So I switched dresses, and I hadn’t taken my earrings off yet but when I looked at the dress and my earrings, they are a perfect match. I love the fit of the dress, nice soft material, I love the print and the colors in and it is very comfortable,  I was very excited when I saw the picture and how well the earrings go with the dress. I can’t wait to wear this dress again once I’m feeling better and can walk more freely, I was gonna wear some flip-flops with it but was not being able to walk I had to switch shoes."
5.0,These were very popular I handed them out at work people got a kick out of it just a little something to make all this a little bit better
5.0,"Pretty flimsy hat, but was perfect for a gag gift, for a buddy who bought his first boat...don't plan on starting a charter service with this one 😁"
5.0,My self just like color an designs
5.0,These are my favorite shorts now<br />I played volleyball and did cheerleading all throughout highschool and five years later I finally lost my spanx from those<br />These were a great cheap replacement that do not feel cheap at all<br />I like that I can wear them high waisted or fold them over<br />Will be buying more
5.0,Beautiful! Excellent quality.
5.0,My sister is going to love these climbers! Presentation of little.box with bow is perfect!
5.0,"It's fantastic.  Bright,yellow gold stand out. The backing is secure although you have to be skilled to screw it on."
5.0,cery cute and could dress down dress up
5.0,"I've used it for two days so far, so am still getting used to a small front pocket wallet.  Holds DL, Ins card, AAA card, and 3 credit cards with no problem, and a little room left for some folded cash, without being a bulky bi-fold.  Not sure that the materials will hold up real long, but at the price, so what?"
5.0,My 3rd pair! Better quality from these folks!
5.0,What a great pair of socks!!
5.0,Beautiful Dress lots of compliments and hugs in all the right places
5.0,I am a big Keen fan and I love this sandal.  I did order a half size up (from 8 to 8.5) and it fits perfectly.  I wanted a comfortable walking/hiking shoe for vacation and around town.  Highly recommend!
5.0,"It was way too big for me, but the quality seems very good. I just ordered too big."
5.0,"I bought this watch for my fiance for our 3 year anniversary of dating and he loved it !!!  It was the perfect gift!!!  I picked it out for the uniqueness and the infinity symbol with it's classy simplicity.  Not only do we have the infinity symbol on our love rings but he collects watches and he did not have a wooden/bamboo watch.  He wore it to work the next day and got many compliments.  It looks and feels like a higher end watch and such a great price and to see his eyes sparkle and how happy he was to receive it!!! I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  The watch was received nicely and well packaged and fast shipping too.  As far as durability, I can't comment because he rotates wearing his watches.  Also, the bracelets that are included match with the watch are such an added bonus!  My fiance wore the bracelets on his other wrist (he collects bracelets too)and they look so great worn together with the watch.  Very very happy with my purchase!  Thank you!"
5.0,Great pants and unbeatable for patrol wear at this price.
5.0,"I have never written a review, however,  had to do for this purchase.  If your body shape is curvaceous; buy this dress and all similar. Its amazing for the price and looks damn good. I was sceptical when I ordered but now Im ordering 2 more!"
5.0,Fit perfect and so cozy!!
5.0,"looks just like any wedding band. Very nice looking. The tungsten carbide is pretty strong, so you don't want to work with machinery with this ring on, as you will most likely lose a finger. For a wear anytime ring to signify your commitment, it is great and looks fantastic. The blue is really noticeable and quite nice looking."
5.0,"Hands down best leggings I’ve got. They’re thick, don’t show my butt or sweat and they don’t slide down. Buy them. You’ll be happy you did.<br />I bought a small, perfect for me. 5’2 110lbs."
5.0,"I got so many compliments on this dress! Love it! The fabric isn’t see thru (maybe if you’re wearing black undergarments though) But he from this annoyingly wide open. So you either have to wear a skirt under it, like I did, or- sew it up. It did come smelling kinda gross but I sprayed it with fabric refresher and tossed it in the dryer and it was fine. For the price I think it’s great! No idea how long it will hold up... I think I’ll be hand washing it just in case"
5.0,As described and matched perfectly.
5.0,Great price for great quality
5.0,gave it to my sister who loves elephants and she just loves it wears to all the time now!
5.0,Very nice skirt. Runs large. Sending back & re-ordering two sizes down.
5.0,This is an awesome watch band for the Apple at a small price. A few minor issues. The attachment to the watch is chrome and does not match any watch case. An irritant is the end of the band is too wide for holders.
5.0,Good for what I asked for
5.0,"The belt color was exactly as pictured, and nicely packaged. The belt material was thick and nice, and the metal accents felt like real metal, with pretty scrolling, that wasn't blurry, or cheap.  I could not keep the belt, because the size was exact, meaning the largest inch on the size chart,  is the last hole on the belt. I thought it just looked bad on me, personally. The metal detail on the end of the belt, touched the metal loop, that I put the belt through, right after the buckle. So it was buckle, loop, belt end, all touching. It just didn't work for me. If you size up so you can use one of the first holes, it would be cuter, with space between the metal elements."
5.0,thinking they were a lot more fluffier but comfortable
5.0,The belt fit great and solid craftsmanship.
5.0,Fits great! The quality is very good.
5.0,"Fits my 4yr old and doesn't feel close to mouth that when they breath it doesnt move within. Also, we just air it out before use from that plasticky smell. Even though my kid has a big head, it requires a smaller mask due to his facial factions so this feets great, normal kids masks fit too big for him, only this and the target brand fit him well. We definitely needed that plastic on the string (not included, we bought it aside) to adjust the mask."
5.0,I love them thanks.
5.0,My wife loves this night shirt! It is cooling and comfy for her.
5.0,Delightful piece. It is small piece approx 2 inches width. Picture indicates large one. Great item for contemporary delicate item for smaller lady . Stone is charming. Recommended.
5.0,I love.... love.... LOVE this dress. The sparkle and quality of the dress is gorgeous. Ordered it for a Vegas trip later this month and can't wait to wear it. Sizing does run small. I usually wear a XL in shirts and a 14/15 in pants glad I read the previous reviews and ordered a 2X it fit perfect.<br />I am 5'4 and the length of the dress is right above my knee.
5.0,"It fits great, looks good, feels good,  Installation was slightly &#34;tricky&#34;, mainly because I hadn't ever seen a link remover like the one that comes with the band, and didn't think how it should be used until I tried a couple of other things first.  Then it was easy as could be."
5.0,Liked the robe totally
5.0,It was just like expected as the picture
5.0,Excellent gift for a preceptor.
5.0,They are cute and comfy and perfect for teaching!! They slide off a litttttle bit at first but I don’t notice it throughout the day.
5.0,What a gorgeous dress wore it for a New Years Event and got so many compliments.  Was really well made and true to fit. I am 5 '9 and it was long enough to wear with 2.5 inch heals.
5.0,"This top is great! It’s a slick material. Hits right above my hips. It gets wrinkles in the dryer, so I’d air dry it or at least make sure it doesn’t sit too long. The back is very cute. I’m 5’6 145 pounds. 36D and a medium fits perfect."
5.0,"Was for Halloween, so made fun for my costume"
5.0,Good fit for the little ones
5.0,The fit was very accurate. I ordered a small for my 14 year old petite daughter and it fit like a small. Very comfortable and considerably warm
5.0,i love my case.....
5.0,Arrived quickly.  Looks just as pictured and very comfortable.  I love it!!!
5.0,"So cheap I expected them to fall apart in a wash & dry cycle, but no. Over a year and these shirts still look, fit and feel great."
5.0,"It looks GREAT! I was hoping to use it as a purse - but it was way too big for me.  If it were half the size I would use it everyday.  I am keeping it for my husband,  It is perfect for him to carry his laptop and his iPad.  Pockets on the outside are perfect for his phone, wallet and keys (he is always misplacing them).  He will be using it for work and as his carry on for the plane."
5.0,Got this dress for my bridal shower and it exceeded my expectations! Very flattering and not see through at all. Only in the back area where it’s supposed to be see through. Definitely worth the price
5.0,if you have thick arms it is a bit small than usual
5.0,Really pleased!
5.0,I love it! Looks very nice!
5.0,Perfect! Very comfy & worked as a true no show with my new Sperry’s.
5.0,"Took it for er to get here, my niece liked it."
5.0,Very thick and warm. Good quality. Beautiful color!
5.0,Carry water but keep your hands free
5.0,"Received a lot of compliments when I wear them at the hospital, love them. Definitely recommend ,easy to wash,color won't fade ."
5.0,Long lasting
5.0,"This scarf is lovely and comfortable,<br />I needed a black scarf to wear to work, this one covers my entire head and is warm. This is my alternative to a winter hat that takes my hair out,<br />also I can wear it under the hat..<br /><br />my hair thanks you very much,<br />Elaine Green"
5.0,Love Love Love them.
5.0,Loved it. It was perfect .
5.0,"Warmest boots I've ever owned, and I live in Buffalo, where we get SNOW!  Couldn't be happier with these boots."
5.0,"Got this as a gift (pant) for son-in-law and he loved, loved, loved them! Said they were breathable, comfortable (loose fitting) and color went well with various T Shirts (black, white, other). Great buy, fits as expected."
5.0,This top is perfect as a top or a dress and the color is so rich.
5.0,Super cute. Just the right size.
5.0,Beautiful scarf. The design is very classy not too cheesy nautical. The material is very luxurious. Much better quality than you would expect for the price.
5.0,Just what I was shopping for. A medium weight sleep gown. The fabric is soft but sturdy. I’ve washed it a handful times and it still looks brand new.  I’m 5’2” and the 1X hits me just below the knee cap. The pink is a medium cotton candy shade.
5.0,"My son is a big Ninjago fan and these are perfect! The color is vibrant and hasn't faded in the wash. It also is made well and the pocket inserts and filters made it perfect! It looked a bit bigger than expected but once the filter was it, it was perfect to show off the entire design and was a good size for my 6 year old who is closer to the size of an 8/9 year old."
5.0,"Got this for my son for a costume. It’s not high fashion and it definitely looks like a cheap fur jacket, but it does exactly what we need it to do."
5.0,I loved this. I get compliments all the time.
5.0,I love this dress. I am 5'11 180 lbs. I ordered a large. It fits me snug. I wear it as a long tunic with leggings and boots. I have not washed it. I believe an extra large would fit too. If you are large frame I would suggest XL. The waist line is adjustable using the front ties. Hope this review helps.
5.0,Excellent condition and well made. Very satisfied with this product .
5.0,Great for a semi formal event
5.0,These are great to wear at work!
5.0,"it was a gift, he liked the shoes, they fit."
5.0,I normally wear medium or large but I decided to order the dress XL in case the run small. I guessed right!!! The XL fit perfect. I love the way it looks and feels. It's perfect for my vacation the the Islands. My husband Loves the way it looks on me. I really hesitating on buying this dress but I'm so glad I did. Just remember to buy it a size bigger.
5.0,Very well made especially for the price!
5.0,Great for in the bust and not too snug in the stomach!
5.0,Helps a lot for all day on computer.
5.0,Looks and feels real!! I really really love it!
5.0,I like how flowy these are. I did get a size too large but that makes them comfier. Great for outdoor summer activities.
5.0,"Wondering fit, I took them out of package thing are these for kids but at my surprise they really hold you in and round out those glutes! You will have some time getting them on until you wiggle them up, once you pass that phase they fit like a glove!"
5.0,Bought this for a 12 year old girl's birthday. The items felt like great quality. The 12 year old LOVED them!
5.0,My favorite new robe! It's super comfy that I don't want to get dressed in the morning! I love that it's long because I can bend down or move freely while remaining covered! I highly recommend it!
5.0,solid construction. good quality.
5.0,"Great product,great service,fast shipping...love these tops and will buy more for sure!!!"
5.0,"Love this product, but one day I accidentally took it off quickly and the the hook broke off the chain. I was able to fix it though!<br /><br />UPDATE: Broke the hook again and was not able to fix. Chain also became discolored after time."
5.0,Love it :-D
5.0,"Nice color of shorts, washes well no wrinkles. Fits well thanks"
5.0,really delicate and nicely made
5.0,I am very pleased with this pretty bead especially since it fits on my bracelet that I bought at Kohls Department Store and I got it for a good price!
5.0,"Beautiful ring, fits as expected."
5.0,"Ring is very shiny and beautiful.  The ring was delivered before the scheduled arrival.  The only thing it was missing was a receipt of the purchase.  Very happy, I am sure my daughter will love it."
5.0,This dress is adorable. Made very well. Size as usual.
5.0,"Beautiful, well made dress! Wore it to a wedding last night and it was perfect. I can't believe the price! I hand washed it in cold water today and hung it to dry (I live in FL and it was a outside wedding @ 93 degrees! Sweaty Mama! Lol) and I think it's going to be just fine.<br /><br />I don't understand the complaints of it not being true to size. I took my measurements, went by the size guide, and it was a PERFECT fit. So maybe don't go by your regular size? Get out the tape measure ladies! I'm also 5'6&#34; and wore 3&#34; heels. For this price I would have taken it to a seamstress to be hemmed if it was too long. Easy enough to do.<br /><br />This dress is also VERY comfortable and very forgiving if you're a full figured gal like moi! Highly recommend this dress. 😀"
5.0,Thick material and comfortable.
5.0,"The best pants ever, Belize edition too (hometown)"
5.0,"I purchased it for the holidays, love the design on the apron and quality."
5.0,"Such a cute little hat! It’s well made, fits well and looks just like the picture! I haven’t tried the scarf yet."
5.0,"These are a little narrow for my 5 year old, but the quality of the sunglasses is pretty astounding given the price.<br /><br />Each also comes in a small microfiber cloth sleeve.<br /><br />We're using them as party favors for my kid's birthday party."
5.0,"They're Underoos, giving this product anything less than 5 stars would be a sacrilege."
5.0,"This dress is amazing. Material, color, stitching all on point. Looks way more expensive than it was. This is my 4th dress from this company, Very impressed by this brand"
5.0,This was worth the price.
5.0,This hat is absolutely perfect for the cold winter days. It’s very soft and can serve as a scarf as well because of the long neck
5.0,very comfy - I like wearing around my house
5.0,"I cannot wait to wear this out! I love that all the shirts I buy from PattyBoutik are long. Super long sleeves and long enough in the torso to scrunch up a little in the tummy area. Being on the thick side, I like that it does that."
5.0,"Updated review:<br /><br />I received a new pair of these sunglasses, now in 58mm and they fit my face like a glove! 5 stars! Exactly what I have been looking for! Seller is simply the best!<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />I really liked the fact that these glasses are basically a carbon copy of the original Ray-Bans from decades ago.<br /><br />The glass lens are very well made and should hold up without serious scratches unlike other, non-glass counterparts.<br /><br />The nose pads are a bit too stiff. I wish they were more malleable as you can find in other brands.<br /><br />My only problem is that my face is a bit narrow and the 62mm looks a bit too large and wide on my face.<br /><br />Regardless, I definitely recommend these non-polarized pair of aviator sunglasses."
5.0,Love them got for my dad for fathers day.
5.0,Just what my daughter-in-law wanted!
5.0,My four-year-old granddaughter saw these on Amazon and asked her grandma to buy them for her. She is so happy with her three T-shirts. Thank you. Nice quality.Would purchase again.
5.0,One of the mask came with a big hole in it
5.0,I love the color and that it's feminine in style not like some bands and comes in beautiful colors. I have them and three different colors.
5.0,Love this skirt! I wore it to a garden wedding and whoever asked where I got it from was surprised that I bought it amazon lol. I wore it with 4 inch heels and it was perfect!
5.0,These are perfect for my special needs teenage granddaughter. I bought this pair and the rose/purple pair so she could match colors to her outfit. She gets lots of compliments and they are bendable with no screws so not likely to break. Very pleased with these glasses.
5.0,Got this for my Hufflepuff niece. She loves it.
5.0,My 8 years old daughter loves this socks.<br />I put them in my daughter's birthday goodie bags and her friends loved it.
5.0,"Raphaella loves this, too cute"
5.0,My little one loves them..soft and cozy!!
5.0,"Comfy, cute shirt."
5.0,My daughter loved the bracelet. We were very pleased!
5.0,Perfect bag. Love it!!
5.0,These were exactly what I was looking for! I knew they would be small because I saw a pair just like them at target for way more money. They look great and don't turn anything green! Perfect.
5.0,Nice shirt!!!!
5.0,"product exactly as described, quick shipping, very happy with transaction"
5.0,"Well made, sturdy, comfortable boots."
5.0,"This is my second most favorite clothing item I have ever purchased on Amazon. It so well constructed. The lining is so soft and it makes it heavy enough to use as a light jacket. It's stylish enough to wear around my office when I am cold. It is easy to care for. It has pockets. Great fit. I am barely 5'3"" and 180 lbs so finding a good fit in a jacket is rare. I ordered the XL. Yet this little jacket is amazing. And way more then what I expect from a of price of clothing at this great price."
5.0,Bought this as a birthday gift for a coworker.  She absolutely LOVED it.  I peeked at it upon arrival.  Loved the packaging (box) it arrived in.  The color of the stone is beautiful.  The color of the chain is very lovely as well.
5.0,"Bought these for my 20 year-old son. Although we live in So California, he always seems to be cold. It's crazy, the other day I saw him walk out the door in his wetsuit, surfboard under his arm, wearing these gloves. He's really happy with them. I don't know if they'd be warm enough in a place where they get real winter but they definitely work well for him here. He's going snowboarding tomorrow but I told him to leave these home and wear his ski gloves on the drive so I won't be able to tell you how they held up in he meager snow we get on our local mountains.<br />The lether feels like it's good quality, the gloves are lined in a short but plush faux fur, very soft and warm. Usually it's really obvious when gloves are made so they can work with touch screens, the fingertips are a different fabric, sometimes there are uncomfortable seams you can feel with your fingertips. Not these. With these Dwellbee gloves you can't see any difference, they look and feel just like ordinary gloves. I asked my son if he's had any problems using his iPhone touch screen while wear them and he said no problems at all. It took some time getting used to, he kept tilting his finger to use the very top where the glove seam was, then he realized there was no need  to hold his fingers any differently than when he's not wearing the gloves. His touchscreen responds fine with the gloves. My son is just over 6'3, we followed the measurement guidelines and bought a Large which fit him perfectly. While not the highest quality glove leather I've ever seen the leather quality is nice and soft, not too thin...and is probably the best quality he's yet seen. I was able to use a discount coupon code on this pair, fortunately they are very realistically priced because now 2 of my other sons and my ex-husband have all said they would each like a pair.<br />Happy to answer any questions you may have..."
5.0,"It is a little bit shorter than I hoped, but other than that, fits wonderfully.<br /><br />My wife is 5'7&quot;, 145 lbs. It's quite difficult to find knee length dresses, this one comes to just a few inches above her knee while standing, but with the lay of the skirt, is to her knees or more while seated."
5.0,I love these pants. Super comfy and squat proof!
5.0,Love love love them. Dident even have to break them in. Comfy right out of the box.
5.0,LOVE IT! Such a fun and striking piece of jewelry.
5.0,This product was exactly as described by the seller. There is ample space for carrying documents in addition to the laptop. The versatility of shoulder strap or handles make carrying the bag easy.
5.0,"A great product at a deep discount price. I'm re-ordering a bunch more. Highly recommended for light, non-critical use."
5.0,So comfy. Love them
5.0,Same. They love the dress and the matching hat.
5.0,I ordered these at 3/4 and they fit perfect. Lots of colors and they're comfortable.
5.0,"Was alittle hard to on,  but finally got it put on the watch."
5.0,Super soft and stretchy. I am happy with my purchase.
5.0,"Bought for husband who was getting knee replacement so normal pants definitely would not work. I liked that these were solid black and didn't look like pj pants for going out to run errands. He really likes them for comfort and also the weight of fabric, not too heavy or thin. Very happy and would purchase again."
5.0,"Aviators are a classic design for sunglasses due to their practicality and style. This is a good execution of that design that costs roughly 1/10th of what you'd pay for the original Ray-Ban ones.<br /><br />Complaining about how thin the arms are (as a few reviewers seem to be doing) seems to miss the point; that's part of the aviator style. The arms seem sufficiently strong to me, given their size. If you are rough on sunglasses, you might want to consider a different design.<br /><br />Shoppers should note that the lenses on these are *not* polarized. This is irrelevant for UV protection, but they could allow more glare than a polarized design would.<br /><br />Also note that these come with a soft bag. If you want a hard case to protect them, you'll need to buy that separately."
5.0,I love this dress! I can't wear it enough.
5.0,Picked up 5 Pins in Average using this. Thumb comes out clean and no rough edges.
5.0,Love its design. Although I did not keep the product because its size I will buy it again if larger sizes were available.
5.0,I love this tote bag so much. It’s so pretty. It’s large and I can fit the small purse inside it and use it like a clutch. The straps seem strong and well made. I get lots of compliments on it. Would make a great gift and it’s at a great price. Win win. 💜
5.0,Length wasn't there for me to use as a dress out but it is so comfy i use it as a blouse and occasionally as pj's
5.0,"Soft material, perfect loose fit without being baggy (I'm 5'4 at 170 lbs), good quality - love this shirt!!!"
5.0,Beautiful and surprisingly detailed for such a small piece
5.0,Bought it for my 12yr old Niece and she LOVES IT!!! It was bigger than I thought it would be and pretty durable. I recomend it!! Will be purchasing others like it.
5.0,My daughter loves these!! Nice fit.
5.0,This is the very well made. Truly love it. It runs a bit large.
5.0,"Awesome sandal!<br />I gave to a US Iraq war veteran, that liked my old pair. I have 3 pairs wish they still made them."
5.0,"Good quality, shiny and perfect for festivals/halloween/cosplay."
5.0,To keep my hands warm put them on right away
5.0,Great watch and great value
5.0,It's actually medium should have gotten small but other than that i love them
5.0,Dress is adorable.  It does wrinkle on the bottom  when you sit but it still looks great.  I wished it was a little bit shorter. Otherwise it's perfect.
5.0,I've had the bands a couple months now and they're holding up real well.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Velcro is good. Love being able to adjust the band at will.
5.0,this was my second pair  purchased.  :) loced1 the first.
5.0,I love this outfit!!<br />It was my birthday outfit and omg i got a lot of compliments!!
5.0,"This hat is VERY pretty and a nice stylish look.  Very well made, very soft and fit as expected.  If you are into hats - grab this one - you won't be sorry!"
5.0,"The fabric is sturdy and soft, and the waist is more elastic than most dresses for young babies/toddlers, which I like! I don't like having my baby in super baggy dresses. The colors are so pretty and I can't wait for fall so she can wear it!"
5.0,Was easy to put on and off
5.0,Perfect for the price and quantity
5.0,Amazing design. Stitches coming off a bit but an overall amazing product
5.0,"Seriously so cute, looks exactly like pictured and the quality is awesome. Would totally recommend!"
5.0,"Beautiful,"
5.0,"I LOVE these!! Not see through as far as I can tell. They wash and dry well. They are high waisted and tight enough to hold my ""donut ring"" in. :)"
5.0,I really loved this dress<br />Unfortunately I had to send it back just because I didn't like the way I looked in it. Great fit great color and would definitely recommend to anyone.
5.0,These are beautiful!! My teen daughter has very selective taste and she LOVES them. Wears them with anything from comfy to dresses!  Extremely happy with them. Only thing I would have liked was a box with them.
5.0,"This watch is worth it's price. I like this watch since it is simple (not too many sub dials, date, etc..)  and looks good on my wrist and so far keeping the time."
5.0,Love this!! Super cute and comfy. Definitely oversized.
5.0,"This is the second of the two shirts that  I have ordered and it fits PERFECT!! I used the rule of ordering one size down when going with British surplus items and found out it was better to go two on this item. This order was for a large due to the fact that the XL that I ordered was a bit long in the sleeves and swallowed the rest of me hole. I am not a small guy by any means I am 5'11&#34; 250 lbs with a 19 inch neck, 52 inch chest  and 22 inches across the shoulders and a 40 inch waist the large is by far an excellent fit still loose in all the right places and the sleeves are the proper length for a normal human being. The Multi-cam is a perfect match to my Propper and  Tru-Spec pants and gear.  And now the quality Wow  is all I can say after shopping all the other will known and trusted brands and being very turned off by the price or the fit and finish of the seams, this Shirt Hits all the marks in the highest order great materials excellent stitching and a price I can truly live with. You cannot go wrong by choosing this Multi- cam battle shirt  the padding is a very nice touch as well in all the right places where your armor and contact points are."
5.0,Hat fit great & is well made. Great price also & quick shipping!
5.0,Looks great in my ring. So excited when it came and it was early.
5.0,I love these pants so much that I bought multiple pairs in all the different styles in this brand. I have trouble finding pants with a long enough inseam & if I do find them then it is usually just slightly too long or they shrink. But these offer the option to be cut to the perfect length or left long. I also really like having the pockets.
5.0,fun bracelet to wear
5.0,Love the quality and color choices
5.0,My daughter loves the Minions so when I saw that this was the last one in her size I jump on it.  Great Christmas present for her. Has warn it several times
5.0,Brilliant shine and very sparkly. Necklace looks way better than I expected. Very happy with it
5.0,"This was purchased for my daughter's Prom Date...It is very well made, sturdy and looked amazing...very happy prom couple and happy Mom!!!"
5.0,great - just like I bought on a already assembled one:)!
5.0,Very cute & extremely soft! Love it
5.0,My Dad loved his new hat!
5.0,Great product to prevent untied shoelaces for kids.
5.0,"The pants are perfect!! Unfortunately, I needed size larger than a large. The large looks like a size 9-10 slim. But my daughter was WAAAYYY to happy take them off my hands. They appear and feel really durable, unless you're one of those person who is rough on clothing. The pant came earlier than expected.  My feelings are hurt. Oh well, I will search around for another pair."
5.0,Nice product. Just as advertised.
5.0,Well made! Love it!
5.0,Awesome wrist band for my Apple Watch 6. Comfortable and easy to use!
5.0,Lots of different colors and styles
5.0,Buff came in rapid time.  It will be perfect for my son-in-law's birthday.  Thanks for asking!😃
5.0,Los colecciono ! Son  preciosos
5.0,Wife said it was the best purse umbrella she has ever had and priced right.
5.0,"Smooth soft silk feels great tied around neck. 21""x21"" smaller size is best for my small face and frame. Looks perky and stylish. Lots of color choices. I've bought 4. Love them."
5.0,Looks great on my mom
5.0,THESE ARE GREAT! LOVE LOVE LOVED THEM AND THEY CAME QUICK
5.0,I did have to order another item that I thought was the same and return it because it was too big.  But these are perfect and comfortable and not too thick.
5.0,I love the fit of these shirts I use them as maternity tops.. I'm 12weeks pregnant and these shirts are perfect for pregnancy .. I have them in diffrent sizes and colors.. Will continue to buy them :) love the way they fit ..
5.0,"This was a breeze to install on watch especially since it came with it's own tool which made switching out a snap.  Band is soft so doesn't really need a ""break-in"" period."
5.0,Very nice packages. It look better than picture.
5.0,I liked it!
5.0,Well made just run a bit small
5.0,I love everything about these mittens.
5.0,"This is so stinking cute.  Colors are very vivid, especially the lime green.  Cartoon-y dinosaurs so it's not scary.  Keeps the rain out but it is not a warm coat.  I like the fact that the green glows as it is noticeable to drivers and others during a rain storm.  Due to the various colors of the dinosaurs, it's easy to coordinate for boots, hats, etc."
5.0,"I'm a big fan of goorin bros. Have been for years. This beanie is my go to, casual , goes with everything hat."
5.0,"This hoodie is so beautifully made, falls right at the waist and is versatile with both workout clothes and a pair of jeans."
5.0,"Great style, fit as expexted exactly."
5.0,It's very good leggings. The material is thick enough to wear in the cold weather and do squats without worrying about see through lol<br />I would buy a different color for sure.
5.0,Good shipping good product thanks.
5.0,Surprised how comfortable and lightweight this is-well-made- a true artisan piece. You'll love it!
5.0,Very comfortable and received a lot of compliments on how good it looks.
5.0,"I purchased this bag to use as a purse, and it's the best purse ever. I was wary about buying a purse online; for me, that's the kind of thing I feel I need to see in person. But this bag ended up being perfect! Lots of room for larger items and a long strap for carrying as a cross-body. It holds its shape well - it is not some big shapeless mess that makes it difficult to find loose items, yet it is not too rigid. The material is comfortable against the body and is holding up well. The charcoal color, in my opinion, is true to picture.<br /><br />Some information you may not be able to tell from the picture:<br /><br />1. The outer left pocket (facing the photo) is not really a pocket; YES, it is a zipper pocket (you can see how the zipper moves along the top of the pocket), and the flap on it velcros closed, but the flap is for decoration only. The flap does not hide a pocket.<br />2. The outer right facing pocket next to it, with the metal ring and black canvas detail, is an actual pocket that closes via velcro. This velcro is not great on this pocket, but I have been able to keep my phone there with no problems.<br /><br />This purse would be excellent for moms who don't carry a diaper bag but still need to carry some items every day; for students who carry tablets around campus; for anyone looking for a smaller messenger bag; for anyone looking for a purse that has the messenger bag feel and can haul a good number of items."
5.0,"A lovely bracelet, looks like lace. Lightweight. Supposed to bring energy and health -- I sure hope it works. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy wearing it. Attractive, hand-made, fits anyone."
5.0,This is a toasty warm robe at a great price. I was looking for a nice robe for my daughter and this one fit the bill. Vendor delivery was very prompt. Thanks!
5.0,"Love that they are flattering, they cover you well, not see through, and they complament my body."
5.0,"I thought the chain would be thicker. However, the presentation of the product is very nice. The pendant itself is very detailed."
5.0,Super cute and light weight
5.0,I am so thrilled with the quality of this jewelry. There will be one happy happy little girl Christmas morning
5.0,Beautiful pieces and arrived much faster than expected! I love them
5.0,"Nice quality, fit is great."
5.0,Beautiful set.  The “horseshoe” theme was great for my Granddaughter who loves and rides horses!
5.0,"I got this shirt for my 12-year-old daughter to have as a ""cool"" option for school and time out with her friends. She has worn it numerous times, and is very happy with it. The fit was right on target, as cited in the product description. The ""criss-cross"" styling is unique and fun. The color is nice, and the fabric is good quality. After several wash/dry cycles, the fabric, stitching, and color are all like new. I recommend it."
5.0,Definitely keeps this sun away and isn’t hot to wear
5.0,Very true to size!! Fits excellent and very soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. I absolutely LOVE this dress!!
5.0,I absolutely love and get to wear close to my heart!
5.0,"I've been looking for a warm and comfortable winter coat.  Even though I am happy with this purchase, it wasn't quite what I was looking for.  I consider this more of a jacket than a coat.  The fleece is very warm but not quite below freezing material. It is so soft though!  I ordered the Cool Blue, and absolutely love the color especially with the orange detailing.<br />As far as fit goes:  I prefer my coats to be slightly roomy especially to accommodate the layers and bulky clothing of winter time.  I wear a medium, and got a medium in this jacket and it fits quite snug.  There's not a lot of extra room for typical winter clothing.  The sleeves come just to my wrists  and the length hits at my hips.  So as far as jackets go, it fits as I would expect a medium to fit.<br />Because it is so soft and comfortable and I love the color so much, I am going to keep it but will just be on the search for a more ideal winter coat."
5.0,"It is a good watch, very light, not expensive and pretty precise (compare with price you are paying).<br />Also good for sports, like running and swimming ( the ones I like)"
5.0,I used for a shower bridal.
5.0,Great tote. I receive lots of compliments every time I carry it.
5.0,both of my grandsons love these key chain figures
5.0,Love this shoe
5.0,Bought as a gift for my little red head. She loves it. Wears it every morning to feed the horses. She likes all the pockets and the very good zipper which is easy to engage. Very warm. Durable.
5.0,As a kid I always loved Sailor Moon and I'm so glad I ran into this socks! They are perfect! They show my appreciation for the anime and they are a perfect fit for me. I wear a size 8.5 on guys. I'm getting me a second set
5.0,Best purse ive ever had enough card slots and even a place for your phone
5.0,This watch is so pretty.
5.0,"This is such a helpful product, great for both shirts that aren't long enough and tops that are too low. These are especially great if it is too hot for another layer or if your camis pull down/roll up. I think this has occasionally rolled up on me, but not all the time like camis do."
5.0,Used this sling pack as a portable oxygen cylinder case.  Works great for over the shoulder of over the head to center the cylinder in the center of the back. The interior could be maybe an inch or two taller or wrap the zipper over the top of the opening to make refilling more convenient. Other than that it has worked great.
5.0,"Perfect size! Daughter loves it, very comfortable!"
5.0,"Adorable skirt!! 5'3"" 130 ordered size small. Fits perfectly. Material is nice and flowy. Length is perfect also, won't drag on floor ."
5.0,I love these so much! Only thing is the outside box gives away the theme of the interior item but I love that about these too!
5.0,Love these shoes. Very pretty. Received many compliments.
5.0,"Love the pants! I would order them 1"" or 2"" longer as they did shrink some. I will be ordering more."
5.0,Great fit. Very soft and comfy. Did not shrink after washing.
5.0,people think I paid a lot more than I really did. I own a 2015 Harley Trike and am the Envy of all the riders at My Harley Dealer.<br />I absolutely recommend this product.
5.0,"I love the style of this dress, it is simple and cute. The material is a little sheer, but nothing an undershirt can't handle. Since it is so light weight, it is perfect for summer weather, and the prints are beautiful. I normally wear a M/L, but I ordered the XL because I needed the length (I'm 6'1&#34;).The XL fit perfectly and there isn't any extra bagginess. The fabric itself isn't stretchy, so keep that in mind for the bust area. I know some other reviews complained about tears in seams, but everything was fine with my purchase. Just make sure to use a measuring tape to verify that the item will fit."
5.0,"I'm not sure where to start here- Best bang for the buck ever. Purchased this for my seven year old as a first watch. I needed one that could get wet and beat up and wouldn't be sad if it broke. It's been several months and the watch never leaves his arm. It gets smacked around at recess, dunked in the bathtub and our pool and keeps going. The little guy loves he can set an alarm with this and the digital display makes it easy for him to see the time at a glance. Awesome watch!"
5.0,"Love this dress,  bought 3 of them in different colors."
5.0,These earrings very pretty.  Decent quality.  I used the pieces to make clip on earrings for my sister and they turned out perfect.
5.0,A bit big but overall pretty comfy. Can be itchy.
5.0,"Perfect everyday earring. Helpful Hint #1, Take your earrings off before you undress because these will slip out easier than ones with backs. Helpful Hint #2, Buy a second pair, just in case you forget Hint #1."
5.0,Love it! Very pleased with the quality.  Fit perfectly. Got here a day earlier too!
5.0,Band was easy to connect to fit bit. Stylish. Perfect fit! Very pleased with purchase.
5.0,It's a black hat. Just what I always dreamed it would be.
5.0,Good quality material. Not thin or see through. Soft and warm!
5.0,"The bra came in a very pretty and elegant packaging. It fit very well and i love the feeling of it or lack there of because it doesnt feel like im wearing anything at all, which is great."
5.0,Happy to have this for work
5.0,I got this as a gift and my friend loved it. It came in perfect condition and looks just like it does in the picture.
5.0,Great price. Found these at glasses store for double that price. Thrilled to find my favorite authentic style here. Thanks
5.0,"These are super cute slippers that I really hoped my son could wear for Christmas. They look very Christmas-y with the snowflakes on them. They are metallic snowflakes so they have a nice shine.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my son is 2 and I bout the size 2-3 years and these are massive on him. He really likes them because he can use the ""ears"" to pull the shoes on his feet himself, but they won't stay on because they are just that far too big.<br /><br />Other than the size, I can't say there is anything wrong with the shoe. They probably had dimensions listed and I didn't look at them, just thought 2-3 years would fit a 2 year old. I ordered the smallest size, so all I can do is wait for him to grow into them! Hopefully next Christmas!<br /><br />I really think the ""ears"" are kind of weird. I probably would have taken a star off for them had my son not been so ecstatic about them helping him get these on his feet. It really made his day to be able to put a shoe on by himself."
5.0,I like the elastic and draw string. The material feels nice.
5.0,"Very pretty with just enough sparkle.  The only thing I dislike is the last 2 inches of the necklace is made of extender material, which doesn't look as nice when my hair is up.  If I don't use the extender piece, it becomes a choker necklace and it was not advertised as such."
5.0,"they fit really well, accurate to sizing listed<br />lightweight so they don’t hurt or weigh your ears down<br />super easy to get in compared to other double flares!"
5.0,This t shirt really impresses me.  You never know with a t shirt if you will get the standard lightweight rather flimsy norm style or one of better quality.  Thankfully this one is indeed of better quality.  It is 100% cotton and has a nice thickness to it without being too heavy.  It fits true to size and forms to the body perfectly.  I got the blue and the color really pops.  I was hoping to get a nice casual t to wear with shorts and jeans during the summer and this totally fits the bill.  I am very happy with it and highly recommend.
5.0,"I bought two pairs of Dr. School's microfiber compression socks.  I bought them with different compression values for comparison.  I already had a brown  pair that I bought at Walmart so this black pair was my second set.  The main thing is to make sure you get the RIGHT size, the RIGHT fit for your feet and legs.  I have bought compression socks based on shoe size and found they were impossible to get on.  So I use a tape measure to measure the circumference of my feet, ankles and calfs and use those, along with shoe size to buy the socks. These fit fine.  While the tighter compression socks are harder to get on - more pull - they do fit and feel supportive.  I can highly recommend this product."
5.0,These are great boxers for my non-fussy 7 year old. He was quickly outgrowing all those typical store-bought pajama sets for boys (they would always shrink) so this was the perfect transition. We bought some plain t-shirts to go with them. You get so many in this pack - good price and you will never run out.
5.0,"He usually wears straight boxers, but had no problem switching to these. They fit nicely, and were comfortable. They look to be well made."
5.0,Very sturdy chain looked great with my charms clasps were small enough to change out charms easily
5.0,Wonderful addition to jacket
5.0,Great colors  and easy to use
5.0,Very nice. Love it.
5.0,"Fits beautifully on a-line body types. I'm a little conservative and have large thighs, so I wear mine with leggings. It's still super cute and it's easy to wash."
5.0,Beautiful product- love it!
5.0,Love these gloves especially for driving.<br />When will they be back in stock Amazon?
5.0,"Love the outfit. I order the XL and it's a little big, but not sure if the large would work.  Comfortable, the material is not too heavy or too thin.  However, in 89-degree heat it is was a little warm (outdoor pep rally for high school).  Make sure you wear something underneath and the shoulder straps need to be pinned or they will slide down (even tucking under the belt strap).<br /><br />Overall, very satisfied.  Looks great and wears great."
5.0,"I didn't like the idea of spending lots of money on socks, but they fit, have no seam to pinch my toes and don't slid down my ankle. I have no trouble with them getting a hole where my toes are.I purchased 4 more in beige color. Very happy"
5.0,Well made and fits perfectly
5.0,"So for me the product is great. Good quality,  fits tight, & looks great. I tend to like my clothes form fitting and this tight but not constricting. I love the feel of the material, it's very comfortable, and the colors are bright & vibrant. I ordered a medium, I'm 6'0 & 198."
5.0,"Well fitting, comfortable, beautiful dress.  Unfortunately, the pattern looks too busy on the top, near the face.<br />XXl fits like a size 14/16."
5.0,Great clip.  Plastic
5.0,I bought these for my daughter.  They are adorable and she loves them.  The insert provides extra warmth and comfort.
5.0,Look better than the picture
5.0,"They are very beautiful earrings, can't wait to wear them to the wedding party i'm going to."
5.0,My son thought I was an avenger!
5.0,"I have been using lanyards for several years. Not a lot available at reasonable prices that are appropriate for men...but yours fill the bill. Sturdy, useful, and strong would be a good description of SiGonna products."
5.0,"I'm almost 41 years old & had my belly button pierced since I was 26. After having kids I took it out, so 8 years later I thought let's see if my hole is still open! And it was! So I thought why not get a couple cute rings & wear them again. But I didn't want ""teenage"" looking ones or too flashy or dangly. These are very pretty & low key. Just enough little sparkle. I don't wear mid-drifts to show off my belly, only in a swimsuit. But still nice to wear something small & understated. Classy, cute, nice quality.  Happy with my purchase!"
5.0,"Built in light is great and it is easy to read, but haven’t had any reasons to know about water resistance yet."
5.0,Minnie Mouse is my granddaughters favorite Minnie Mouse nighty
5.0,"I'm 7 months pregnant and these are nice and long to cover my bump. Nice and stretchy and fit just right. Definitely plan on buying more in the future, these are great."
5.0,Great buy for the bucks
5.0,Love it. Cute. Good quality. Nice size. Exactly what I wanted.
5.0,This jacket is amazing. I thought it was going to be a cheap looking jacket no it's actually like the picture shows. Soft on the inside and the material on the outside is a soft silk texture. I'm not one to like camo that much but because it looked so good on this jacket and I love My Hero Academia I decided to try it out and I'm so glad I did. I have no regrets getting this jacket. Hopefully it holds up as good as it looks and feels.
5.0,I really love these sandals! So cute and they go with everything.
5.0,"The shirt is beautiful and it fits my son perfectly. We love the color and how it comes with the matching neck tie, hankerchief,and cufflings."
5.0,"Works as mask, but also attractive and comfortable for everyday wear."
5.0,Exactly as described and easy to use
5.0,"Beautiful item, exactly what I needed"
5.0,So pretty and unique.
5.0,I love these soft comfortable socks! They are well made
5.0,Size 10/12 and any bigger this belt wouldn't fit
5.0,"Nice dress, I usually wear size 12US ordered a large fits nice. Could have gotten a medium."
5.0,This fine quality tie was true in color and matches the burgundy shirt  I bought to go with it.  Gift for son-in-law who is a Pastor.
5.0,I am a new RN on a very busy MED/Surg floor and I am on my feet all day. When I first started my feet ached so bad by the end of the day. I started wearing these after my 3rd shift and they have made such a difference.
5.0,"Great fit and looks great, I would definitely buy this item again!"
5.0,These are some sweet shades!!  I love the blue tint.  I'm starting to collect enough sunglasses to start my own shop.  Thanks Amazon for the selection!
5.0,They are a gift. Everything arrived as expected.
5.0,Pretty and good price
5.0,We lost my mom tragically and I wanted her photos on a keychain for my daughter. She loved this and the box the seller sends with it is so beautiful. Such an amazing gift. Please search my mom Carol Smith and Sturdy Hospital and pray for justice
5.0,"Comfortable,  easy breading, light weight. Thank you"
5.0,This is a really cute dress and of great quality.  It's going to be worn as a casual or dressed up for fancier events.  Would certainly recommend it.
5.0,Amazing purchase
5.0,I love it. Thank you so much!!<br /><br />April
5.0,Cute and just as expected! Should include a gray color!!
5.0,Very warm in cold climate
5.0,"Very soft leather, seems to be great quality! I was expecting a more plastic-y feel for the price."
5.0,Absolutely gorgeous! My new go-to earrings. And at this price? They can't be beat. :-)
5.0,"The perfect winter outfit to wear with leggings and boots. Fit is true, and flattering, and it has pockets. Very nice grade of cotton, and doesn't shrink."
5.0,As described. Bought as stocking stuffer for my youngest to give to our oldest.
5.0,Love the shirt runs a little small
5.0,This is actually really cute. I’m very skeptical about clothes from Amazon because the quality is usually crap but got this on a deal and so glad I did!
5.0,Super cute!!! Bought big so she could wear awhile!
5.0,Use at work a d there stylish for what they are
5.0,"At first, I was looking and searching for a purse strap to replace the old one that my purse previously had and was hesitant to purchase this specific purse strap and not because of how the product looks but because of the reviews saying that it wouldn’t be the same color, came damaged, or it wasn’t even the right one. I decided to purchase it either way and when it arrived, it came exactly as shown in the preview. Now my purse has a new strap and makes me happy that I can use it again after so many years. Thank you for your time."
5.0,The polarized glasses are great. Great buy.
5.0,I love it.  Fits great and is very comfortable.
5.0,I'm in love with this brooch. It's stunning and a wonderful conversation starter.
5.0,As in photo
5.0,Super cute! They fit well.
5.0,Amazing. Will definitely re buy at some point.
5.0,"I am pleasantly surprised at the power of these magnets. They stay on the ear lobes. They will fall off if you accidentally brush them with your hand or elbow, which I have done a couple of times. I have not tried doing anything athletic in them, but they would probably fall off.<br />  I don't think you can really expect more than that from magnetic earnings.... or fridge magnets as my younger brother says when making fun of me. All in all - they look like real gauges."
5.0,"Received this shirt today and it’s great, yowie wowie. I will let this in to my closet!"
5.0,"Because it attaches to your keys, it is always handy.  Liked so much I bought them for my family members."
5.0,Long. Just as advertised. Sheer! Double sided. We will get a ton of use out of this!!!
5.0,I like the new fanny pack with its extra pockets. Perfect for cell & other
5.0,Fit perfect. Looked semi dressy. Great for our vacation.
5.0,Best vegan belt I’ve owned. Holds up well and I have 3 now. 2 black and 1 brown. Had very nice experience with Corker customer service as well.
5.0,beautiful colors and great shirt.  Exactly as it shows in the photo!
5.0,This is a beautiful bracelet.  Perfect size and the beads are beautiful.  I would highly recommend this seller.
5.0,You can’t be the value for this price this is warm if you’re a regular 5052 double XL this will 55 with a nice undergarment mock turtleneck etc. button down with a T-shirt very comfortable very warm a great mid layer between a light or heavy winter coat
5.0,I love mismatched socks. I have several pairs in various colors.  They are heavy weight and I wear them year-round with regular shoes and sandals.
5.0,"These are great!  They are super soft, fit just above belly button, nice and long and very comfortable (not tight at band).  LOVE them!!"
5.0,"If you can't afford a nice leather bag at $200, go for a really nice looking, sturdy canvas bag..This bag is stylish , made of sturdy canvas, stands on its own, casual, light weight but not sloppy..  It's well stitched.  The leather/canvas straps and leather logo patch give it a bit of class. :)  It has a large interior zip pocket in the center and a phone pocket, which I could do without but more important, the entire bag zips shut, tho' the zipper is not one quick pull...just needs a bit of guidance.  It holds all i carry and space for more.....netbook, phone, pocket book, coin purse, glasses, etc.  The depth is just right, not too narrow or too wide.  I'm 5'2&#34; and it 'fits'  perfectly on my shoulder or hand carrying without dragging the floor or street.  The bag has the function AND the look I was after.  I'll definitely look for more Hiigoo bags."
5.0,Perfect for an impromptu Halloween party. I sprayed them with a little bath and body works shimmery body spray to add some sparkle.
5.0,I have received several compliments from wearing this watch. I love it's unique design! I have yet to scratch it's face or damage it's band.
5.0,"These are excellent water shoes.  I wear them kayaking, rolling the kayak from my campsite to the lake, kayaking, and back to my campsite.  I have worn them on three long camping trips and they are holding up well, unlike my NRS booties that were twice the  price.  They dry fairly quick.  The only negative is that the removable insole sometimes moves when they are wet and I am walking long distances.  I will buy these again."
5.0,Just the right size for what I needed and its very pretty. Would recommend it to any one else love it!
5.0,I love the dark colors and the fabric is comfortable. I definitely don’t regret this purchase. Thank you.
5.0,Pusheen slippers too big for granddaughter
5.0,Extremely soft and vibrant colors- my five year old loves this

5.0,Fit exactly as expected.
5.0,No more carrying around readers and bifocal sunglasses.  These are perfect.
5.0,I've used this person a few times for large events. Getting through security was a breeze! I also used it while on vacation. Nice to not worry about ruining a purse when something spills on it. Just wipe and go!
5.0,"Bought these for my daughter who had her ears pierced about 15 months ago.  The only earrings her skin seemed to tolerate were the surgical steel earrings that were used for the initial piercing. However, the backings were very large and wasn't allowing enough &#34;air&#34; to the back of her earlobes, thus causing ongoing crusty drainage.<br /><br />So I figured we'd give these a try- some gold and very small backings. The backings are very dainty- so much so I found it difficult to hold, but they were surprisingly easy to secure. And so far so good- her ears do not seem to have any drainage and are finally healing!  These also look &#34;rich&#34;, according to her- and loves to tell her school friends she's wearing gold earrings."
5.0,"This dress was exactly what I hoped it would be when I ordered it. I wear size 38H bra, am 5'2 and weigh 285 lbs. The stretch and length were perfect."
5.0,"It works well for bicycle riding, keeps wind out of the eyes. Have only really used the darkly tinted one so far.  Good price point for the number of lenses included."
5.0,This was a gift for a young lady that just graduated from Air Force basic training. She loves it.
5.0,Very cute colorful coat! I wear it everywhere and it is a great outer layer piece.
5.0,Fit great and I'm a big dude.  6ft 315.
5.0,"I ordered two packs of these and gave one to my sister in law and she loves them! The colors are lovely. I could tell they are of good quality as soon as I received them and even the outside package lookes premium and secure. In fact, I just tried them out these days when it becomes colder and they are very comfortable and does not glide and the “little “tongue” (you will know it when you have them) on the ankle helps it better stay inside the running shoes! Overall, a good purchase experience!!"
5.0,Bought as a Christmas gift. Absolutely loved it.
5.0,These are as comfortable as the tivas I usually purchase for a fraction of the price. I love the colors too.
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for! Love them! Just wish size 8 was available for my military boyfriend. I can't find them anywhere!!
5.0,"this apron is just too cute! I love the  material it is made out of, it can be wipes off really easily. all the seams look really nice. really well made. I would definitely purchase more products from this company! You can't go wrong for under 10 bucks."
5.0,I was looking for a smaller fish hook style earring that I could wear every day.  These are perfect with just a little sparkle.  Love them!
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:ae24180015629f699164bb100f6d385]] I'm 5'3 180lbs, it wraps around me great."
5.0,Fits perfect looks really pretty my girlfriend loved it!!!
5.0,Really comfortable and quite warm due to layers.  Perfect pants.
5.0,"Even after insurance we were still paying $200 - $300 out of pocket for my kid's glasses.... Two different high dollar designer frames was constantly having to be repaired and never lasted my kid more than a couple weeks to a month between repairs. His last pair looked like they were fished out of a dumpster by the time they were a month old...<br />These EnzoDate frames were cheap and we them for no other reason then just to have a cheap spare for my kid to use while his frames were repaired... To our surprise these cheap frames have already outlasted both of his previous designer frames! as a matter of fact he's wore these four months and they still look and wear like brand new.<br /><br />As long as these will be for sale, I will never buy another high dollar designer frame again for my kid. I already ordered a second pair of these just to have on hand in case the first pair get misplaced.. hands down I recommend these all the way!!!"
5.0,A great price for 100% cotton
5.0,"Love these little delicate snowflake earrings!!  Beautiful finish – they almost sparkle like snow!  Very light-weight and superior quality for the money paid.  My four-year-old son loves it when I wear them, which is almost every day because they are small enough and neutral enough to go with just about anything.  Wouldn't be surprised if I found myself wearing them even in the summertime while dreaming about snow!"
5.0,"I could not love this more. My cat Tallelah and I had an amazing bond because she had been horribly abused by her owner next door. Truth told, I couldn't take it anymore so I stole her. I know it sounds bad, but her owner was a bad, bad man who abused his children as well. They were taken away shortly afterwards. I kept her in the house 24/7 so he would never see her. At night I lied in bed softly repeating, every night, &#34;I will never hurt you. I promise. I will never hurt you&#34; over and over. After a week she came and slept on the floor at the end of my bed. The next week she slept on the bed at the end and the next week she finally came and curled up in my arm. It's been eleven years but my heart still aches for her. Thought she was healthy and she coughed one time and I too her to the vet and he said she had liver cancer and about 24 hours to live. No symptoms. I literally fell to my knees and sobbed. She passed the next day. It's been 11 years and I still miss her and my lap still feels so empty when I'm reading. I got this the other day and will never take it off. Feels like a part of her is with me again. Favorite thing I've ever bought from Amazon. I've finally started to heal."
5.0,"if you order please order one size smaller, I wish I did but its okay I will use it around the house"
5.0,I love this purse. It's material is so soft and flexible. Plus it's the perfect size... not too small or too large! Great space or everything I carry! And you can adjust the strap to make it look like a satchel too!
5.0,Just what I needed for wallet ID  + +
5.0,At first I didn't think they were going to fit. But with a little time I got them on even with my size 11 big toes.
5.0,"The product was just as I had envisioned it. Great Job. Excellent workmanship. Just that the sleeves are about 1 and 1/2 inches too long. Or, is that normal?"
5.0,Love this dress .. I read previous reviews and some said the dress runs small . Normally I’m a 2 so I ordered a 4 .. I’m 4ft 11 and 102lbs. Ordering one size up it fit perfect ! I have been to a lot of balls and this was the most comfortable dress I have ever had !
5.0,"I've wanted an Anello for months. Finally caved in and decided to buy one. The bag is small (this is the xsmall after all) but don't let it fool you: it can pack quite a lot. I am able to carry my Hobonichi A6 planner - with cover and cover on cover, my Kindle Keyboard 6&quot;  -with amazon's original &quot;leather&quot; case which is THICK -, my umbrella, my wallet, my keys, bubblegum, my tablet - samsung tab 3 8 inch - with case, my power bank, cellphone - Sony Xperia Z5, headphones, pencil case, and scarf.<br /><br />One of the things I love about it is that it doesn't lose its shape: the bottom of the bag and the top make it possible for it to always hold the shape so it doesn't look bad or saggy.<br /><br />I have gotten lots of compliments over it as it is a beautiful bag. The strap is comfortable enough to carry over the shoulder even when it's heavy, and also the handles are not flimsy, so your hands don't really hurt if you are grabbing it."
5.0,This tank is so amazing! Perfect fit! I wore this to Vegas and got so many compliments!
5.0,Well made.. A little long for granddaughter but hemmed very easy.
5.0,"I bought one of every brand, and as far as I can tell, all of these different cloths are exactly the same -- some just have a name printed on them. They all work beautifully, so just by the cheapest."
5.0,Looks Great on me
5.0,Love these headbands!
5.0,"This belt is made of what feels like a very high quality of leather. It's thick, but still supple, and feels like it will last a long time. It's embossed with a very attractive design that makes this belt quite unique. The brushed nickel finish of the buckle is a good match for the belt. It, too, feels well-made and  of substance. It's heavy, and not easily bent. I like that even the prong that fits through the hole is sturdy, straight, and well aligned.<br /><br />I like the width of this belt. I feel it allows the detail of the embossing to shine. It still fits comfortably through belt loops without tugging or loosening the stitching on your pants. Because the leather is so thick, it doesn't fold or crease as I bend over or sit. The overall quality of this belt is a standout, and the embossed design is different from any other belts I own.<br /><br />I received this belt free in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely my own and based on my personal experience wearing this belt."
5.0,as advertized.
5.0,I work at a cold storage for meat and produce temps are from 0 to 35..I they keep me pretty warm
5.0,These are sturdy and well made. These come with a nice cover bag. Gave as a gift and they loved them!
5.0,"I love this vest! When the heat is powered on it truly makes being outside in the cold so much more bearable and enjoyable.  The high heat gets very warm and unless very cold I only keep it here to start.  Then I settle into medium and if i'm exercising I end up going to low. The vest itself is very lightweight.  Very little filling.  Im small sized but even for me I needed to order size up to medium. 5ft 4"" 115lbs."
5.0,Looks and fits great. Arrived earlier than expected.
5.0,I especially like the design of this elegant masterpiece! It looks stunning!
5.0,Lovely glasses and being Polarized is awesome. Great delivery and packaging!!!
5.0,Best workout leggings ever!! So soft and fit well!
5.0,Quality hat. Fits as expected and looks great. Get lots of compliments on the hat and of course my beard. Highly recommended if you like quality hats.
5.0,A very nice belt and good value for the $.  It is precisely as described and should last for years.  This belt was purchased to replace a very similar one I've worn off and on for over 20 years.  It completely meets my expectations.
5.0,nice case for the price
5.0,Kids loved them as prizes at our VBS

5.0,Excelente servicio súper feliz recomendado es hermoso
5.0,Love love love this comfy dress. Comfortable but not too casual.
5.0,Get a size bigger than you normally get. I wear a medium in blouses and I am on the bigger side upstairs. And this was very tight to get on there is no stretch. Once on its very comfortable and soft. I really like this blouse. I suggest not wearing a bra with it as I found is easier to put on without a bra. Also the inside has almost like an insert where it will hold you up.
5.0,"Super soft, love them!"
5.0,Great classes
5.0,"Different colors, different styles. Good for cycling on the mountains in the morning. Love Them."

5.0,"I've been growing my Fitness Fox Headband collection for almost 3 years now! [[These are just a few!]]  Their Jersey Tri-Folds are PERFECT for working out or for a cute, casual look.  They absolutely DO NOT SLIP!!! Stop wasting your money on headbands that don't stay put- these are the only ones that ever stay on my head!<br /><br />They are super absorbent- no more stinging sweat in your eyes! And if you check out their website, you'll find even more cute prints and styles that are constantly being changed out ♡<br /><br />I recommend them to anyone looking for that perfect, fun headband:)"
5.0,I love the jeans so much but the size 3 was too big for me. I gave them to my daughter
5.0,Love this piece. So cute for festivals! Size is adjustable
5.0,"Just got this tunic delivered, in the red color, and I am in love! I'm a size 12 and curvy, and this top is really flattering. It is long enough for good coverage with leggings (I'm 5'8). I just ordered another color I love it so much. Will be wearing these a lot this fall."
5.0,"I'm a photographer. I purchased this dress for a styled shoot I did. It fit exactly as expected. Sheds a bit of glitter, but that's not an issue.  It was stunning and worth the price."
5.0,Fit like a glove! It hugs your curves. I got soooo many compliments that night for my friend's formal event. I will definitely order again!
5.0,"Cute and stylish,  The little handcuffs are great and I get compliments on them all the time."

5.0,I love the color.  Fits true to size.  I will order another one in a different color
5.0,Love these shoes. Like the height and comfort. Nice style can be dressy or casual
5.0,Product seems to be as advertised. Nice fleece lining with a water resistant shell. Too hot right now to test outdoors however I do feel ready for winter and snow.
5.0,Each if my kids selected mommy and me necklaces as presents to my beautiful wife.  All were happy.  Excellent packaging and thoughtful detail.  Definitely recommend.

5.0,[[VIDEOID:58d45c24fe4110bdce715c5c4b118208]] [[VIDEOID:d3b37642a90138503310e291258c4bdf]] Super cute ring that i wear almost all the time. One can wear it on special occasions or all the time. I ordered a size 8 and it is true to size. I really like that the band is not thick in size but it does have a good size wide band. I do love to wear rings most of the time especially when i am going out. Not sure if i would consider it as a wedding band but you can wear it on whichever finger you chose to wear it on . Great little piece to add to any gals finger or give it as a gift or get one for yourself . I did receive this complimentary for my honest thoughts and unbiased review.
5.0,The material is very nice it fits exactly how it was supposed to and he’s so cute!!
5.0,This has a nice fit and pockets-  it is a longer style shirt and comfy
5.0,Nice feeling fabric and a nice fit!
5.0,"We recently had 9 days of sub freezing weather here in Texas and my husband works in a non- heated warehouse. He wore this as A base layer under his clothes and said it fit well, didn’t irritate him or become itchy and it kept him warm. We would buy again, and $30 for both pieces seems to be a good price. We would purchase it again. He usually wears a large, we ordered a large, fits great even though it looked small."
5.0,This is a LOT LOT LOT more quality than I expected honestly.  I ordered it thinking I could wear it here and there and that it would turn the neck green if worn too long and probably be fragile (cheap)... Man was I wrong.  The actual charm piece is solid and has a nice heavy-duty weight to it.  The chain doesn't feel as sturdy but it doesn't turn your neck green (I have been wearing mine for almost 2 weeks straight) AND it has survived a 2 year old pulling on it.  I really like that it is adjustable and it is super cute.
5.0,Very cute suit. Wore my normal size. Love the colors.
5.0,This is so comfortable. The pockets are extra helpful to make it look like you are not just wearing a potato sack. I’m going On a trip where my shoulders and knees have to constantly be covered so this is perfect.
5.0,My dad is obsessed.  If you have a chess fan who has all the normal books get this one!
5.0,"There really isn’t anything I didn’t like about this ‘half shirt’ trio!!  Very high quality. Quality material, quick efficient shipping. I would have expected to pay a LOT more than I did for the three of these."
5.0,"Great dress, fit beautifully and had many compliments!!"
5.0,"The necklace is lightweight, pretty, and different."
5.0,Nice product. Bought it for my brother who is a Vietnam vet in a nursing home.
5.0,"Cute sunglasses. Will be good for the beach - they're really dark. Cheap enough that if they get scratched or you lose them, it's not the end of the world."
5.0,Me queda estupendo
5.0,"It is beautiful, just like I thought it would be and my boyfriend loves it.  Would definietly recommend it to my friends."
5.0,"Yes, cotton, soft but size the medium a little snug!! Expect a little more room. But otherwise great choice for my 13 year old son."
5.0,Perfect for a quick costume
5.0,My son LOVES to play Roblox and lost his mind when he got this.
5.0,"I love the rich look and the packaging that it came in, is really nice.  I will pass these on to my girls as some of my nicer jewelry pieces."
5.0,"She loves it, only wears it a Christmas."
5.0,My 8 year old has very small wrists so it barely fits.  But that isn't the watch's fault.  :)  It looks and works great.
5.0,great quality. great look
5.0,I Love this hat!
5.0,Very excited to find a small skirt that still has length. 16 yr old approves and that's always a happy day!
5.0,my husband was well pleased
5.0,Super cute!!!! I'm 5'9&#34; and normally about 140 lbs BUT I'm 5 months pregnant and this still fit .. super cute everyone loved it including me and my hubby who was the milkman!!! Nicely made
5.0,Beautiful scarf.  Took three weeks to deliver so consider that when ordering.
5.0,"A pesar de no ser originales, son una gran pieza, es un buen producto."
5.0,"I ended up going with the XL because of the other reviews. But, I believe a large would have been perfect for my size. All in all I love this skirt!"
5.0,"Great glasses, bifocals. I could have used a 1.75 thought. Ah , probably growers into them. Nice look. Happy. :)"
5.0,Really nice!  Its not too small-1.6 inches across.  Looks great!  Everyone is surprised how low the price was.
5.0,The value for the money is good you can’t ask for more for a simple chain. It’s cute and it does the job if you need to take your ear phones off. It’s a cute chain I don’t recommend wearing it if your sweating or in water but just as an accessory it’s cute.
5.0,"Cute, soft and just as described."
5.0,I think this cloth is good at maintaining and polishing my jewelery pieces.
5.0,"Vale lo que se paga, realmente muy bueno"
5.0,Better-looking than I expected.  Sometimes it looks more brown and sometimes it looks more green but it's a nice looking hat and it fits well.  The stitching it clean and the patch on the front is really nice.
5.0,Ok so when I ordered this I thought it was not going to work. WAS I WRONG !! It worked so good it sticked so well to my skin. Lifted me up just right and was very easy to apply. The directions where so simple and easy to read and comprehend. They where also easy to remove. There was no odor or smell. Don't hesitate ladies !!!
5.0,Great look for a watch . I enjoy wearing it.
5.0,"Love this brand, only complaint was ordered a medium and received a large....which I can still wear and didn't realize until I cut off the tags, but would have preferred a medium.  Excellent value for the price.....this is my 4th pair that I own, along with a couple of the 3/4 length of the same brand."
5.0,I was a little worried because I saw a lot of reviews saying it was too small and too short but my outfit fit just right and it wasn't short at all... I can't wait to wear it for Christmas......
5.0,"I was very excited to receive the bands because the bands that come with the Fitbit got sweaty and made my wrist very uncomfortable. I wore it indoors for a few days and it held up well. I went out and after a few hours, I realized my Fitbit wasn't on my hand! I retraced my steps and found my watch (thankfully) as the handle had broken. Hoping the company will send a replacement.<br /><br />Update: I reached out to the company and got a replacement! I’m so happy I didn’t have to make a return as I loved the band so much and didn’t want to take it off just to have it replaced. It looks great and is very comfortable to wear all day. It’s made of fabric so I try not to get it wet as it takes a while to dry but that’s minor for me. Love this band! Definitely recommend."
5.0,Fits great for smaller women who are tired of shopping in the Juniors section. It's a nice fabric and looks good on. I'm very happy with this.
5.0,Love these earring studs. Real stones instead of pieces ground up and glued together. Sterling silver settings.
5.0,"Love the fit.  It's comfortable, the fabric is soft.  Perfect for restful sleep.  And the color is great.  Just as I expected."
5.0,"I love these safety glasses. I have bought quite a few pairs. They are very comfortable, and I find the polarized lenses to provide very clear vision. They seem to be quite scratch resistant too, as I am always cleaning the lenses with my t-shirt while on the job. And not to mention, they have style also! I do recommend!"
5.0,Durable and looks great. My 16 year old got this fir his birthday with keys to his new to him car.
5.0,"Love these Fitbit bands.  The slim band is comfortable and easy to install, as is the wider band.  The slim band has a non-woven backing though, so while it''s very comfortable day-to-day, I would hesitate to wear it swimming.  The wider band on the other hand, is woven all the way through without a backing and I would feel good about wearing it while swimming."
5.0,"I got this dress last week and already wore it twice! My husband loves it and I've several compliments. I am 5'4&#34; 120lbs and I ordered a medium because I don't like these dresses to be too tight, medium was perfect for me. The material is soft and I love that the dress is modest enough for work but also sexy enough for date night. I will be getting other colors."
5.0,"Very cute, my nephew loved it."
5.0,Love this brand! I have three of their skirts. All their denims have some stretch to them so they are very comfortable. I am 5'10&#34; and they are long enough for me.
5.0,Love these! They fit great and are the perfect amount of stretch.
5.0,[[VIDEOID:25966fb0d5b151070cf5d3c98abdc49b]] Omg this dress is life
5.0,these pieces are beautiful!! the ring fit perfectly!!
5.0,Small but works quickly. The attachments that come with it for everything we need it for.
5.0,These were perfect forpainting; not too big and flat enough to paint a nice design easily.
5.0,"I needed something to keep my hair out of my eyes while working outside but did not want to wear a baseball cap.  These fit the bill nicely.  They are comfortable and, as an extra benefit, they keep your neck cool if you wear it a certain way by keeping your hair off the back of your neck.  The only downside is that you get some pretty silly ""headband hair.""  Of course, my other option is ""hat hair"" so why not be fashionable and cool with these."
5.0,Nice and soft!
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised that this is a good looking, feminine blouse.  It is thin, but not I would not call it &#34;see through.&#34;  A good versatile style for work or weekend.  Very happy and will likely purchase in other colors."
5.0,"Love this dress! Many, many compliments every time I wear it. Great for desk to date. Comfortable, washed great with no shirking. The pockets are amazing!"
5.0,"Very cute and soft, fits perfectly"
5.0,best
5.0,The picture of this top does the shirt no justice! It looks fabulous on anyone of any size! You would love this top and the price is perfect too!!
5.0,"Great mask, perfect color and just what I wanted for Halloween."
5.0,This product is of much higher quality than I expected. Fits my fiance wonderfully. She absolutely loves this dress. Something s little different she said. Looks good and feels great.
5.0,"For the money I took a chance, I figured I would not be out much if they proved to be worthless, for the money these are fantastic, excellent quality, I am hard on glasses, if I get a year out of them then these are my new go to for every day use.....buy them, you will not regret it....I feel like I have made a good decision......Real Good....."
5.0,I love these earrings!!! They are small but speak so much!
5.0,It’s so easy to wear and comfortable and warm. Bought a few different colors as they were much less expensive than one I bought few months ago from another brand and retailer.
5.0,PERFECT FIT
5.0,Love this top...it fits well and doesn’t wrinkle.
5.0,husband really likes this. Bought this for my husband for a Valentines gift and he just loves wearing it. He loves the quality of the elastic and has found that if it starts to get stretched all he has to do is take it off for a day or two and the elastic seems to correct itself.
5.0,"Good quality, not too thick.  Love all the sockguy designs!"
5.0,"Cute, personal piece for me and my husband."
5.0,The grandkids love these keychains. They have hung them all over their backpacks. Cute for girls and young boys.
5.0,Love it. I just ordered one for my friend.
5.0,Found a pair of these at TJ Maxx and liked them so well that I looked for a back up pair. They are very comfortable and have held up well.
5.0,So the rings arrived on time. They fit well. However the symbol is so small and hard to see on all three colors. Not at all what I expected. I wish it was larger with a contrasting color so it can be seen. Otherwise nice rings.
5.0,I am pleased with my purchase
5.0,Loves it thank you
5.0,Loved them some much that I wore out my first pair and bought two more.  One for now and one to wear after I wear those out.  Sleek and sexy but stills okay to wear for work.
5.0,"Gorgeous dress , I'm 5'5 and it was below the knee a bit .  It's very stretchy and I for sure should have sized down two sizes"
5.0,Pretty. Works well. Comfortable to wear in spin class.
5.0,This hat is just as gorgeous in person and everyone that I crossed paths with absolutely loved it!
5.0,Purchased as a gift. Recipient very pleased but has not yet packed and travelled.
5.0,"I LOVE this dress! It’s comfortable, flattering and has pockets! I’m normally a size 16/XL (38DD chest) and I ordered this in an XL and it fits perfectly. The bodice is snug enough that I don’t even need a bra. I think adding a belt adds to the look. It does feel a tad short (I’m 5’6”) so I won’t be bending over in it! It hits just above my knee, but because of the bell shape on the skirt it flares out making it feel shorter."
5.0,My daughter loves this dress and says she feels pretty wearing it.  Comfy. Decent quality. Can’t go wrong with a unicorn dress.
5.0,For the price it's great!
5.0,"This shirrt has become one of my new favorites. It is so soft and comfortable. I'm usually not a fan of turtlenecks, but since this one is loose it doesn't bother me. It looks so cute on."
5.0,"I like it very much, i use it for live music performance"
5.0,"I love this!  The fabric is a thick cotton with a mesh cotton lining on the upper torso, really nice for mild weather. I like the frog clasps down the front. Very feminine. bric is nice and the fit is good. I'm usually a size 8. I ordered a large and it fit just right."
5.0,"It's cute, it's furry, and it keeps my head and hands warm. The quality is right up there with the expensive name brands. I'd say that my hood is slightly more grey, and slightly less red than the one in the picture, but it doesn't really change how cute it is."
5.0,I love the backs they keep it secure and comfortable. The feathers are delicate and beautiful these are my favorite pair of earrings!
5.0,Very nice product exceptional quality only down side is tape on case. The tape peals off some of the cases effects
5.0,Great packaging & 12 month free maintenance!  Beautiful and light weight
5.0,A hit with my teenage granddaughter. Lovely little silver earrings.
5.0,"Love it so cute, fits true to soze"
5.0,"This is a ""beautiful"" band to dress up the Fitbit 2!  As a person who likes a ""little"" bling, this is just right.  To be honest, there was a little difficulty in removing a couple of links to get the right fit but it was well worth it.  Thanks for making my Fitbit 2 look like a great piece of jewelry!"
5.0,"This coat is perfect it fits very well, I ordered the XL that size was to small, Returned and purchased a XXL. I’m 5” 9” tall 170 lbs. I just love  the light weight Faux  fur lining, super warm. And comfortable. Can’t go wrong with this one."
5.0,"We are repeat clog buyers, thanks to a gift one year.  These clogs are a good buy (similar to what you can find at Meijer - so if you have to check sizes)  They are easy to get on little feet, they stay put, and are easy to clean if necessary.  For the most part these clogs are durable, though the design insert may peel away from the shoe frame, but nothing a little glue can't fix."
5.0,"These are comfy, look nice, and are true to size. I bought a pair of the pull ons (no zipper) and was worried they might look weird. They look just fine (: A few reviews said they bunch up a little at the knees. This is accurate but it’s not bad. I’ll be buying more!"
5.0,Impressed by the quality and fit. Love it! Great value for the price
5.0,Super cute! Great quality and doesn't feel cheap. Can't wait to wear them with my costume.

5.0,Love it. Very Sparkly.
5.0,"Great quality for the price, the gaskets are great and they seem to hold up really well so far."
5.0,"Fast shipping, good quality."
5.0,My husband needed great support and these slippers fit the bill.  Quality slippers!
5.0,Loved these pajamas.
5.0,I needed a wallet for my  5 yr old son but all I could find were billfold wallets. I wanted something easy access for him to open. He only needed it to carry money for bake sales at school.  I’ve found so many zip wallets are mostly made for girls. Since Amazon has everything I figured I would check here and I was right. My son loves it. It’s not a fabric material which I think is a plus. Cleanup and durability will be easy. Overall happy with this purchase. It was exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,These fit our 3 year old perfectly! I would say she is average for her age. She loves to wear them! So far very durable.
5.0,I love this beanie! Perfect size! It slouches just as desired. I originally bought it for my boyfriend but I had to order another one for myself. The dip dye is gorgeous
5.0,Love love my shades!
5.0,"Easy to use, good value! I bought it for a bride as a gift. She added it to her bouquet ! ♥️"
5.0,Great sunglasses. I purchased these for a gentleman I support with disabilities and he loves them.
5.0,"I really liked this dress. I bought a medium which I normally wear in a dress but it was a little large for me. I did not look at the size chart though before I bought it, so that was on me. I can still wear this though without it looking too big. I can't wait to wear this in the fall! I am 5 foot 1 inch- 115 pounds; it went a little below my knees. It will go great with some boots!"
5.0,"I'm 6'3"" 200lbs size 11.5 shoe and I bought the large size. I didn't buy these specifically for the compression benefits but they definitely made me less sure after running. The socks came up right below my knee I ran in shorts in 39 degree weather and they helped keep me warm while still breathable. They are a little thicker than your average sock but not to hard to put on. I already ordered another pair."
5.0,Easy stretch fit.
5.0,"Great Price, really nice product"
5.0,"Very cute! Always nervous buying clothes online but actually fit, looked as advertised, and good quality."
5.0,"So cute! My daughter is 3, yet tall for her age and the 2-4 fits perfect!"
5.0,"So I didn't read the description for these well enough, and I was surprised when they arrived and I realized that hidden inside these sneakers are significant wedge heels. But my daughter loves them and thinks they are the absolute best shoes ever. They're heavy because of the heels and I thought maybe with the height plus weight of them it would be a little hard for her to walk in them (she's a kid and not used to heels) but she was walking all around, even running a bit, with no trouble at all. She says they're super comfortable. They fit as expected and the little zippers make them easy to put on and take off. So for what they are, they're great shoes."
5.0,"Bought this as a surprise gift for my cousin who is a big fan of AJ Styles. She really loved it and it fit just fine. As long as she's happy, that's all that matters! Very nice shirt. Thanks! :)"
5.0,"This bag is well made, light weight and has the compartments I need/like. Wish they had more patterns and colors"
5.0,"Exactly as described, good quality product."
5.0,"I've had my septum pierced since I was a teenager and absolutely love it. Now that I'm in my late 20s I need to be able to tone it down when need be, and Cocorina's seamless 16g rings are the perfect way to do it!<br /><br />Septum piercings can quickly overpower a face, especially on women. These small rings fit well into my nose and didn't hang out or take over my entire face! The seam where the ring joins together is completely seamless and totally invisible, and I couldn't even feel it going through my nose. The rings themselves are small enough for septum, eyebrow and lip piercings.<br /><br />I do like to change my jewelry to work with my other facial piercings. This pack of rings came with three seamless rings in three different finishes, so I can find a ring to work with anything! I've found that the black ring is best when I'm trying to downplay my piercings, while the gold ring has been very fun for special occasions.<br /><br />Cocorina's body jewelry has quickly become my go-to for my septum! I did receive these rings at a a discount but price doesn't change how great they look, nor does it effect my review."
5.0,"Original posting of the Jock is spot on. Fit is excellent, I have a 32"" waist and ordered a  Medium.  Inside the front portion is a opening for mr. johnson and it is extremely comfortable. Very Sexy."
5.0,Hat fit great. Earrings super cute.
5.0,I really like these
5.0,Looked good. It is a Christmas gift if I get any feedback I will let you know.

5.0,Used this dress for family photos and loved it!!
5.0,Omg these are warm and so comfortable!! Super cute!! Great quality.
5.0,Grandson really likes them
5.0,"I like loose fitting night shirts to wear casually in the evening, as well as nightwear.  These one-size-fits-most shirts fit nicely and loosely, even after washing and drying them twice.  So, I'm really happy with them.  My usual nightshirt size is 1x, and so you can judge from there about the fit.  The material is good quality and they are well made.  I'm very pleased."
5.0,"I love this sweater! It is very comfortable and looks good with so many things! I’m 5’4, 120 and the small fits perfectly. I recommend wearing a cami under."
5.0,I wish it was longer but I love it
5.0,"My son loves his robe!  Material is very soft but absorbent, fit is true to size.  Will order more for sure.  If looking for a robe to dry after shower or bath this is it!"
5.0,I love how it feels an looks so pretty. It does look so beautiful my daughter loves it.
5.0,She loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,I love everything about them
5.0,Beautiful glasses. Item arrived on time.
5.0,"It’s so comfortable! It fits just as expected. I got a medium and it’s very cute.its not too thick where I sweat but it’s very cozy and doesn’t strangle my neck, a problem I have had with previous turtlenecks"
5.0,"This is so cute, I can't wait to wear... I would like to see more colors."
5.0,"Perfect, comfortable"
5.0,Perfect fit and cute
5.0,"Fits as expected, looks amazing on our lil elephant"
5.0,"These earrings are very pretty, sparkle, and are larger than expected.  They are a light aquamarine blue color.  Love them!"
5.0,"I liked at first sight, easy to read, really handsome watch, the band with white stiches pairs very well with the watch. In the dark the superluminova works great, easy to read at night all the time. Totally recommend it"
5.0,Love the color and large print.
5.0,"Nice quality, real good fit, color was great, length was plenty long enough and matched shirt perfectly. Price was reasonable."
5.0,"Really pretty, just perfect for a pool or beach cover up. Perfect fit for me, but I'm super tall and its pretty long."
5.0,Absolutely beautiful. So much nicer than I expected.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my unbiased review and am happy I can sincerely recommend it. Enjoy!
5.0,They look and fit great!
5.0,"This is so nice, I bought it in black, too. Sturdy, good quality, and  nice leather that is soooo much nicer than the Ray-Ban case I previously bought. You won't be disappointed!"
5.0,I love the material of this dress and how stretchy it is. It's long and fits perfectly!
5.0,Perfect sockets going to get them in other colors easy to put on and so comfy cant eel them great ones
5.0,Great fit my daughter loves it
5.0,My son loves it!  Good quality. Looks great.
5.0,Great jacket the water glides right off. the size fits perfect. it's a well made jacket. I already recommended it to a couple of friends.
5.0,"Comfortable, stretchy fabric and great quality for the price! The slit was pretty high so I decided to pin the top of it since I wore to a wedding, but the ruffles help it stay classy. Such a great dress for Christmas too!"
5.0,Gifted to my adopted daughter and she LOVED it!
5.0,It's so cute and worth it. I completely loved it
5.0,"Usually I’m pretty lazy about reviewing items, even when they are great. This one is too great to be lazy about! I am absolutely in LOVE! The color is vibrant, it is just the right size, and fits everything I need perfectly, and in an organized fashion. The quality is excellent, it looks way more expensive than it was!"
5.0,"Cute, perfect for a little girls dance class."
5.0,Bought it for myself. Love it! Would work for a child too but probably too large for a toddler. Super soft and warm.
5.0,My wife loves it. Time will tell if the RFID protection works as advertised. I have no way to test its effectiveness. At least we have went the extra step.
5.0,"Very cute, earrings are little but very cute and good quality too"
5.0,Quality is great. Beautiful top. Wonderful fit.
5.0,"I am 135, 34 ddd and ordered M size, fits beautiful!!! Color is dusty pink looks very elegant!!! I love it, honestly after reading reviews I was little worry but very happy with my purchase!!! It’s kinda simple, but looks very expensive ,"
5.0,"Feel like I got the deal of the century. Brand new, with tags stating the price of $499! The softest lamb leather ever. I’ve received so many dang compliments. The hood zips off so you can dress this jacket up or down!"
5.0,"Dual layer, with pocket option where you can add in an additional filter sold separately. Supper soft cotton and mentioned to be organic as well, which is important since your young child will be breathing through this all day into their delicate lungs. No metal in mask at all around nose which at times gets messed up over time from bending and washing mask. The ear loops are elastic, comes with double barrel on each ear loop and even a generous knot tied on the end to prevent the barrels from coming off. There is also elastic on the top and bottom of the mask to help with comfort on the child face. I was happy with other masks that I have had in the past but these make me rethink, as these are a true 5 star item ... actually 6 star. I wish they came with the filters or even a neck strap to secure and not loose but those items can be bought separately to make this full proof.<br />Happy to recommend and appreciative that I found these."
5.0,"However, at $120 I feel like it should have come with one of their travel cases.<br /><br />It's a really expensive denim hat. That's about it. Not much more to explain.<br /><br />I bought it cuz I collect Melin hats but nobody should spend this much on a denim hat that doesn't come with all the goodies the other premium hats by the same brand come with.<br /><br />I don't know, I might wear it. It doesn't even look that good honestly. It is what it is. I have much cheaper hats by them that look 1000x better.<br /><br />Whatever...I bought it for a collection. Who really cares?"
5.0,I bought these for my daughter as a summer shoe and really happy with my purchase. They are the same color as pictured and a bright blue color.  They are full mesh allowing air and water to enter the shoe but protection for the toes. We have not experienced any odor when wet and hold up well. We plan to buy another pair.
5.0,My daughter loves these. Fits well and looks great!
5.0,"Not to small not too big, even though it is marked for several sizes the ones that correspond to small, medium, etc.<br />Fit quite comfortably."
5.0,Works well on my silver jewelry. Good price too.
5.0,"perfect for what i was looking for! insert does come out easily and sand is tough to get out, but will likely keep an extra pair or two around!"
5.0,It stands for a Cinderella shoe hanging from my rear view mirror (my car is orange like a pumpkin).<br />This really is made Cool!
5.0,These are so cute!! My daughter absolutely loves them. I got one size up just to be safe and they fit with room to grow. Super soft and flexible but sturdy at the same time.
5.0,"Love this hoodie, so comfortable. Button sizes run small so go up one size. Overall I love North Face"
5.0,"No las he utilizado, y en mi ciudad hace mucho calor, pero para viajar en lugares frescos, es muy bien para evitar pérdidas de pasaportes y dineros."
5.0,"It is a little bigger than I was expecting, but it is an absolutely stunning piece of jewelry. I absolutely adore the colors."
5.0,Love love love!!!!
5.0,Like the comfort & waterproof feature.
5.0,"The fit was perfect and very cozy and better for T's instead of the actual button down. Where to your content, but I'm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,"I have been searching for a watch that is attractive and water resistant, but that I can adjust or remove easily for working as a nurse.  This is the one!  I love it so much, I might buy another so I can have one for work and one just to wear--and this is from someone who has never worn a watch outside of work where I have to. this one has totally changed me. It's the same as the Main St Mini, but this one is water resistant.  Also the company that sells it, was great in responding to my question about how to adjust the clasp. Don't let it fool you. It's so easy."
5.0,Amazing! What a great experience watching our son see color for the first time.<br />Worth every penny
5.0,I got Clear Lens Glasses + Bifocal Reading Lens this is great for reading.  I have RX for glasses that matched was perfect.  I love it.  Thank you much.
5.0,"So comfortable, fits great, more than I expected, I'll be buying more. It's an everyday cozy dress or dress it up with heals and accessories!"
5.0,[[VIDEOID:44e7871c98e221c9aba9928c6115bf01]] Me encantaron haci las quería grande excelente
5.0,"Shipping was not as fast as I would have liked, but I am happy with the shorts themselves. I wore the black pair today, all day, and they have been great! They haven’t gotten too loose or needed to be pulled up all the time. I’m very pleasantly surprised and will be ordering more in different colors!"
5.0,"Easy to instal,  fits nicely on my wrist. Good quality"
5.0,Always get compliments. Keeps me dry. Always gets the job done!
5.0,"Purchased as a gift for my son's friend that is a girl (age 9) and is obsessed with cats.  It is really adorable for the price.  Very delicate, but not too delicate. Has a &#34;girly&#34; feel to it."
5.0,i LOVE these earrings. I haven't worn them yet but they are really pretty. I can't understand why they are no longer avail for purchase.
5.0,"Beautiful shoes, fast shipping thanks! I recommend ordering half size larger."
5.0,I have metatarsal problems and I wear these a little higher towards the toes when I am home to open up and stretch the metatarsals and it helps immensely to cure the problem and give me relief. Great product stays put.
5.0,I bought them as a gift for a friend who served with me in the Air Force.
5.0,Nice dreas
5.0,They are very soft and cute.
5.0,Perfect fit and easy to care for.  Brick and morter have quit selling them so had to turn to on-line to find the perfect item.  Thanks!
5.0,Nice belt. Wear a size 8/10 and fits well. Seems like it would work for a couple more sizes either way. The buckle is attractive. The color is deep tan.
5.0,Very cute! I like it!
5.0,"Got this for my wife to help shield her chip enabled cards. She really likes the wallet, and as far as we can tell our chips are now safe."
5.0,"Nice material, good size to carry your documents, tablets, may be 13&#34; laptop."
5.0,Very comfy and the best part it has pockets
5.0,"Love them, perfect size for 2nd hole"
5.0,It's awesome
5.0,Warm good material hat! Super happy to of purchased !
5.0,My daughter's amber pendant was stolen and I replaced it with this one.  She loves it.  The pendant is exactly as pictured and it was shipped right away.  Thanks.
5.0,Nice deal
5.0,"My dad freaking loved it! He’s more of a minimalist so he doesn’t like flashy gifts, but he absolutely loved this little gift. It meant so much to him and it’s really just a keychain, but the power behind the love is unreal. 10/10 recommend if you love your dad beyond the flashy gifts."
5.0,"So flattering on me AND my sister! She’s getting one size larger, but it has so much stretch that the XS fit her well anyway! Thick material and very classy, it should be in every woman’s closet! Super buttery soft fabric, it feels great against the skin. Win all around!"
5.0,These make packing and finding things when you get to your destination 100 times easier than just throwing things in a suitcase!  No longer will your clothes shift and wrinkle as your bag is man-handled along the way - the cube help keep things need and again - organized!  Will be buying more.
5.0,It tells time.
5.0,This dress was beautiful on. I wore it for a formal night on a cruise and so many people complemented me on how it looked. The corset back is impossible to do on your own but works well with a helper. I felt beautiful. I am 5’6” and the dress just skimmed the ground when I wore two inch heels.
5.0,Like it a lot actually. This is my first compression style shirt/tank and it's cool. The one problem I'd say I have is that it slides up a little but that's it. I also wish it would run a bit smaller on the size but I am experimenting with sizes ATM so maybe I just got one that too big.
5.0,Nice everyday weight. Nice print and comfortable. Perfect for travel.
5.0,"I ordered 2, the green with the zipper in front and the turquoise with zipper in back. The green runs small, so I got a medium and it's perfect (usually a S) but the zipper in back style runs true to size so the medium was too baggy!! So zipper in front, size up. Zipper in back, order usual size. That said, these are wonderful!!! So excited to wear them and not worry about getting burnt. Good quality for low price!"
5.0,"The cardigan fits good, true to size, maybe one size up could also be good choice, would definitely buy from this buyer again."
5.0,These things are fantastic. They keep clothing folded and are excellent for keeping things organized. They’re light weight so they don’t add Much at all to luggage weight. I wish I’d found these long ago when I traveled a lot more than I do now.
5.0,I bought this for my gen 1 moto 360 the band came quick woudnt fit of course the pins that came with it were to short i have extra pins so i took the quick release pins out and put in some 24mm pins i had fits perfect and is very comfortable will buy again preferably the right one lol. i have a very large wrist at 7.5in and it fits at the last hole
5.0,Fits nicely and comfortable to wear. Really love the colors
5.0,"Bought these as a gift and my sister loved them! She did not want to take them off. This size is perfect for those who like to wear small, delicate earrings. I purchased a larger size for my other sister who likes to wear more of statement earrings that show. Very pleased with the quality and packaging. With Prime received them in 2 days!"
5.0,Great spring!!!!
5.0,Love this! Fits great and feels good. Couldnt be happier with it!
5.0,"I bought this in conjunction with the Infant Paste (Ctrl V) shirt by the same seller, both in navy. Fit as expected for both. The navy colors look slightly different from one to the other in Amazon and I was concerned they wouldn't match, but they do. Quality seems good, though they've yet to go through the wash. Love the concept and the price was good. Arrived quickly, well ahead of Amazon's expected delivery date."
5.0,Soft perfect fit tee ..... love it and I would highly recommend it
5.0,"Absolutely my favorite Lulu dupe! I have tried several Brands from Amazon. Some brands come close, but most missed the mark in quality of fabric and sizing.  The sizing on these is perfect everywhere, except a little loose in the waist.  Not so much that I wanted to return! These are keepers and gained me a lot of compliments!  I’ve already purchased more in other colors."
5.0,Nice feel and looks
5.0,I bought a necklace to match. Really nice jewelry for fashion jewelry! I was impressed. Will defiantly buy from again!
5.0,The dress is very pretty. Fits a bit small in the top.
5.0,"WHEN I WEAR THIS BRACELET TO SEE ALL THE flip, dresser, MODERN LOOKS GOOD. mY ARM IS SLIM FIT WELL BUT SHE IS pefect."
5.0,I got this for my favorite guy and he wears it all the time.  Looks great on him.  Great quality.
5.0,I’m 5’9” 155lbs 34D and I bought a medium. It’s fits almost perfectly. It is slightly to small on the top but I knew that would be the case buying it so that’s not anything against the suit. It’s also a little loose right at the waist band but I prefer this to it digging into me. I haven’t worn this in the water because I don’t really ever go in the water but when dry it’s not at all sheer. I will be keeping an eye out for more colors I like!
5.0,"Wish I found these sooner! Best beach volleyball glasses I've ever had and iv had a lot! They stay on!! I play competitively and am falling in the sand a lot, but my gladses don't fall!!!! I never lose them either. I just slap them into my beach bag and they oh so conveniently stay wherever I tell them to. I pretty much can't live without them."
5.0,Son adecuados para un Nino de 10 años son muy cómodos y no pesan nada
5.0,"Beautiful dress, but there is wire coming out of the tulle on the bottom!"
5.0,"This is so cute, warm, and soft.  Fits my figure.  Only complaint is that it stretches out and washing will be a pain.  It’s worth the effort!"
5.0,Love this jacket! Fits my son well & has everything he loves in one design.
5.0,My partner loves these. They were perfectly airy while still protecting his skin from burning
5.0,"My daughter just turned 3 yo, is almost 40&#34; tall and 35 lbs, and this leotard fit perfectly but if your child is much taller than that, buy the next size up."
5.0,Backpack was as described!! Great purchase!  Shipped and received as promised!!!
5.0,"Affordable and attractive, love the color choices!"
5.0,I purchased these back in 2016 the purple and green pair and they were a hit. Everyone had asked me where I got them from. Unfortunately someone has stolen both pairs from when we were on vacation and I ordered the yellow and blue pairs and these sunglasses do not disappointment. I highly recommend them!!!!!
5.0,Got it for a friend and she adored it.
5.0,"I'm 5"" 3' and normally wear a Large but bout a size up which fits nice. Just the waist keeps falling down. Otherwise fits nice."
5.0,"What can I say about a jeweler's loupe. It magnifies as expected.<br /><br />Then, again, it is very solidly made.  Actually, for the price, I expected something cheap.  That's what I was paying for.  Cheap ...<br /><br />Yet, it is very well made, and well worth considerably more than the price paid.  A rare gem (no pun intended) in this age."
5.0,Great fit and so cute
5.0,Goos.
5.0,Loved these &lt;3
5.0,I love the color & shape of these sunglasses!  They are my new favorite!
5.0,I bought a similar outfit on vacation a couple of years ago and have been looking for another one and finally found it on Amazon. Love it.
5.0,So comfortable!  Almost passed on buying because of the fabric. Happy I did. Really like these.
5.0,Beautiful shirt. Lighter than other Laurel Burch t shirts but much more dressy.
5.0,They work fine. they are bulky so I store them in the car and only use them there.
5.0,Well made and nice materials. Warm and snug fit. My new favorite beanie.
5.0,"I absolutely love these for early dawn or night driving, and I actually found them to be help driving during fog as well."
5.0,Omg I absolutely love theses!!! They look exactly like the real Celine ones! Love love love!
5.0,Perfecto para ir al gym
5.0,Great product for the price. One belt is slightly thicker and wider than the other in the combo I chose. The metal clasp came on the thicker and wider belt. Both are easy to fit and stay in place with well constructed buckles.
5.0,"This is an absolutely beautiful bag, appropriate for an evening event. It's roomy enough for a thinner wallet, phone and small make-up bag."
5.0,The real rose inside lasted a year even with toddlers opening it inconsistently. It is dead now but the necklace itself is sturdy and reusable. Beautiful product.
5.0,Very comfortable and fits nicely.
5.0,Perfect for kinder grad! Great buy!
5.0,Oh my goodness. My boyfriend and I got so many compliments when we wore these. They're perfect. Thank you.
5.0,"I received the mask very quickly and am happy with the product. It's made of nylon or polyester, but it allows you to breathe and isn't heavy. Lightweight for easy breathing while wearing it. Lovely design and you can pick one to your liking. Excellent."
5.0,My grandson loved these jammies so much that when they had pajama day at school just recently he wore them! My daughter says he looks so cute in them! The pajamas were a bit big on him but he is a small boy. So I would say that this size 8 ran a bit big. But he loves them and I loved the detailing on them so we are all happy....so far they wash well!<br />So if you have a child who loves spider man........he will love these jammies!
5.0,"The outfit is gorgeous, love the lime green, the material feels like a swim suit almost, it’s really smooth, kind of had to becareful getting it over my shoulders because it was really tight but once I got it on it felt perfect. I prefer to have it unzipped but if your more conservative you can zip it up all he way & still look nice. I’m 5’2, 152 lbs . I got a Medium. I will have to return this because it came stained on the butt two black dots .<br /><br />Update : I returned it and got a new one no stains or anything fits perfect !"
5.0,Great price and sturdy material
5.0,This is a very soft and comfortable hoodie.  The color makes it even better.
5.0,Very popular with my granddaughter
5.0,"Took a risk as this was one of the cheapest straps. Feels really good quality, smells as it should of leather and looks great on my Tissot watch. Even comes with the tool to change the strap. Couldn't be happier."
5.0,Excellent dress
5.0,Loves it!
5.0,Beautiful and comfy! My daughter loved it! It was long and we had to hem it. But I think she's just on the shorter side of the size
5.0,"If the belt is truly all leather and lasts an appropriate amount of time, I will be happy with the product.  If the outside and inside leather separates as happens so often in such belts or if the outside leather cracks, I will not like the product."
5.0,"The slippers I received were stamped on the sole and printed on the tag as Large, but they were actually medium, which is what I wanted. They are good quality slippers."
5.0,These have a little rubber non-slip feature built in to them so they won't slip down as most no-show socks do. These are more like shoe liners. They are no-show and work well.
5.0,"Bought these for the husband and he really likes them.  They're cute, fun and cool."
5.0,This is top quality and has a great nautical vibe.  Adorable.
5.0,This wAs a bummer<br />I’ve ironed<br />And fluffed It in dryer<br />The wrinkles make it look gross
5.0,product is awesome!
5.0,Beautiful dress. It fits and is well made
5.0,Absolutley beautiful piece that will go well with my Vampire outfit for Halloween
5.0,Good color variety in the pack for these comfortable dress socks.  Fit is excellent.
5.0,I like that this is adjustable and stretches. I am on a weight loss journey and I can adjust this as I lose weight. The buckle lays flat and is easy to click on.
5.0,Great value. Very sparkly and had weight to it.... didn't feel cheep.
5.0,Love this dress!!! I was a little worried about the fit but it fits great!!
5.0,These are real great socks.  I have long legs and they went well past my knee.  Finally an over the knee sock for those of us with not so skinny legs...yay!
5.0,This dress right here is so sexy on !! Girl I was on my Beyoncé I’m feeling myself 😂
5.0,Love the style and fit
5.0,I’m amazed.  Beautiful especially for the price!  Weighty and looks much more expensive.  Got it for my birthday and the whole family loved it.
5.0,I like  this dress. It is true to size and hug those curves. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this dress. It washes good
5.0,Son look so good in this shirt
5.0,"I LOVE this dress...it fits me perfect 5""4' and very curvy😄, it's the perfect summer dress, can be worn with or with out the straps. It brushes my feet which is perfect for me. It's a gorgeous dress and the color is great. I get a lot of compliments!!!!"
5.0,"Very long scarf, not really very warm because of the material, but it is very cool!"
5.0,"LOVE this dress. Love it. Fits perfect, very stretchy, and easy to clean."
5.0,These are great snorkel bags - Each with plenty of room for one pair of fins and accessories.
5.0,Stunning quality. Fits my daughter perfectly.
5.0,It’s a very nice sweater. It’s thick and very warm. It’s well made and very soft. I like the fitting as well. Looks expensive but very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend buying it.
5.0,"The crystals are SO perfectly clear and shiny.  I was worried about the crystals being placed crooked/excess glue/etc but the bracelet was just perfect.  I do warn you, I have a 6"" wrist and it was a perfect fit, any bigger of a wrist size may have some snugness.  I had MANY compliments the night I wore it."
5.0,"I use this as a thumb ring and I am very happy with it. It hasn’t turned my finger green, so that’s a plus! I wasn’t sure because of how inexpensive it is. Love it"
5.0,"To be honest, I was hesitate to buy these earring. Concerned about the size and the quality!! To my surprise- these earrings are amazing. I’ve wanted the David Yurman earrings that are the same shape (slightly larger in size) but I didn’t want to spend the money.<br /><br />I’ve worn these everyday/night. LOVE THEM!!"
5.0,Very cute. Granddaughter will love them.
5.0,Stylish and great fit!
5.0,Very cute and the picture didn’t do it justice. Came in cute little bag. It was exactly what I was looking for.
5.0,"The necklace is heavier than expected, quality way exceed the price!"
5.0,Very nice material and light and comfortable.  The design is nice quality and has lasted so far.  Very cute and different and great price!  Updating because the shirt has lasted through the wash and is very comfortable.  I just ordered another one for a friend of mine!
5.0,"Get so many compliments and everyone wants to know where I bought it! Looks great on, it's definitetly a diva's belt."
5.0,"I bought this set of sunglasses, because I needed variety, in as much as I not only do outdoors target practice, in regards to being LTC, I also ride my bicycle often.  This set has exceeded my expectations......it,'s great to be able to change out the lenses asap, if I deem the sun's glare too strong, as my eyes grow sensitve to sunlight, due to my Chiari Malformation.  The fact that I am able to keep everything assembled in a convenient hard case, makes this set very convenient---because not only does the case really protect the lenses, it helps me keep everything together and protected."
5.0,"So adorable, and comfortable to wear, they came quickly in the mail..."
5.0,"Love the fit, perfect for hiding the newly acquired tummy, feels free and not clingy"
5.0,"I love this bracelet. It’s comfortable, light, and I rarely take it off. I could have gone with the smallest size but I don’t mind my bracelets moving too much. Since it is a men’s bracelet I suggest women measuring their wrists if they’re worried about sizing."
5.0,So soft and fits well.
5.0,"This is an Awsome Skull bracelet, it definitely gave me pause when I opened the package, I thought it would be small and cheap looking,, quite the contrary,, it's heavy duty stainless steel. and it looks absolutely Badassss...... I came back an bought the all silvertone and the goldtone/silvertone..Luv-em all....."
5.0,Great necklace and quick shipping!
5.0,Watch is very nice & well made though I could resize the bracelet of the watch & it says I would have to go to a specialist to change the size. Bt I’m not tryna do all of that just for it to fit my exact wrist size
5.0,Very pleased with this one. It seems to have a loose connection but you just need to slide the battery around a bit and it works fine. Does the job and the cars and see me when I am funning int he dark. A suggestion -  that the illuminated belt should go all the way round as it only in the front and the cars coming behind can not see it.
5.0,Made a great mother’s day gift
5.0,So I have bought glasses from Sojos before about a year ago and i loved them but now a year later im buying again. I love thw fact that their glassrs are so reasonable and not so expensive like a lot of glasses out there plus its such good quality.  They never disappoint I will always buy glasses from them because they keep up with trends and have great quality for a great price. THANKS again sojos. Follow me on instagram: @jazaenicole
5.0,"This is a super comfortable tee shirt – the cotton is soft & satiny, and it has lots of stretch (I don't know how they do it without some spandex or something in the fabric – it's labeled 100% cotton). It's a lightweight tee shirt, good for summer.<br /><br />The shirt is tagless (nothing to irritate the neck) and labeled ""Made in India."" Time will tell how well the fabric (and the bison graphic) wears. I'll update this review by leaving a comment in the comment section if I have any problems with it."
5.0,This is a cool hat and it’s lined with faux fur for extra warmth I wasn’t expecting that.  On snowy days in Chicago this is a must so super convenient… while I may look foolish who gives af when it’s 12 degrees with snow blowing all over the damn place and you can’t keep your eyes open.  This is a for sure staple!!!
5.0,I got my glasses today and I absolutely adore them they’re so so beautiful and very comfy to wear!! Thank you!!!
5.0,"I wear this band at least six days a week. It’s comfortable, nice price, quality seems nice, a good by. I would recommend."
5.0,A good looking watch!
5.0,"I’m 6’0, 185 lbs., 42” chest, 32” waist. Ordered L and returned it due to being skintight like a wetsuit. Sized up to XL and it’s still very slim but roomy enough to move around and work out. The fabric is lightweight and thin, perfect for summer and warmer climates. The hood strings are the perfect length and feel high quality and substantial. Material is all synthetics with no natural fibers. Very satisfied with it.<br /><br />But again if it wasn’t clear, order at least one size up."
5.0,"Great seal, easy breathability, inhalation and exhalation are more comfortable than any other I tried.<br /><br />I wear glasses, and fogging is much less of a problem than with other masks."
5.0,Bought at beginning of school year and two months from end of school year and the book bag and lunch box look almost new. Definitely a good buy.
5.0,"Shipping was fast.  I ordered 2 of these - for my 8 year old daughter and her friend and teammate.  It fits and doesn't fall off, and has room for the girls to grow.  It's a lovely gift!"
5.0,Simple and sweet.  Gift for my grandson which he loves and wears all the time.
5.0,"Fitted tank! I wear a medium normally, I bought 2  as gifts when I received, I kept one sent the other back because it fit me just not tight fitted, there was no way they were gonna fit who I bought them for. It is a quality tank with a quality print though. Has washed well even. If you want loose but bigger! But worth buying!"
5.0,"Fits as I had hoped.  I read reviews and decided to go for it.  I love this hat.  I am not crazy about the bling and with the sequins, if that stitching starts to fall apart could look hideous underneath, but for how comfortable and warm it is and how much use I've gotten out of it so far, it's totally worth it.  And if it is hideous underneath, I could have someone crochet something that I could sew in its place.  Would buy again!"
5.0,"Light weight, and perfect to keep the Florida sun off of my face."
5.0,Got soooooo many compliments on this suit!!  True to size!
5.0,"It did great, just a little large at first. I put it in the dryer ( washing instructions say not to use dryer) for a few minutes and it fits perfectly now. Received many compliments and so fiqure enhancing!"
5.0,Love my new chiffon beach cover up!
5.0,"Seems to be good quality, looks great, sentiments"
5.0,Good fit and the material was good.
5.0,they are so delicate and beautiful - I love them!!<br />-
5.0,"I have purchased several masks on Amazon.  Was looking for a made in USA mask.  1 of the 3 was not made in USA despite being labeled as such, but both of those masks had a strong odor when opening the package, that was NOT the case with the 8th of LA Mask.  This mask was also significantly better made than those other masks.  This mask I would have given a 4.5/5 if I could.  The only negative on this mask was the ear straps, wish they were made slightly better and possibly a nose ridge clamp.  All in all I would highly recommend these and have already done so to friends and family."
5.0,LOVE this item! These socks keep my feet warm almost immediately upon wearing. I will definitely buy this again.
5.0,My daughter loved them but they were too small
5.0,Bought for trip to Mexico
5.0,Bought this for Autism Awareness day at work to light it up blue.. love it
5.0,These run big. Size down when you order
5.0,OMG!! These are my go to tights. Comfortable for lounging in or even wearing out.  The fabric is pretty soft and light. Absolutely love these and I love them even more because Wonder Woman is all over them.  Get these right now!
5.0,I bought these in a size 11.5 and they fit great. They look very nice and look like there made to last. There very comfortable and do great on the field. There is no need to go buy other soccer shoes for double even triple the money these are. Just remember to buy them a size bigger then Nike cleats. Overall there great.
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:789397ce805c79a22ad91e5d8d5ca546]] The price was amazing. This is the cheapest that I found it and it's prime, so it got to me within 2 days. The rest of the mask wouldn't have gotten to me till after November the 14th. Also, it's well made. Everything is intact. It's beautiful, sexy, and it's exactly what I wanted. The cord is long enough so you can put the battery pack anywhere you like and it also has a clip on it so you can attach it anywhere you need to. perfect! perfect!"
5.0,Bought these for my niece. They were so adorable and comfy I wanted some in my size! I loved the patterns and colors.
5.0,Love this jacket. It's very comfy and light weight.
5.0,"Not too tight, and keeps sweat off."
5.0,Totally in love with these!!! I need to buy more
5.0,"I go through one of these about every 5 years. However, this one still ticked but the strap broke. Replacement strap was about as much as a new watch."
5.0,"I don't know what every one is talking about when they say the tool is cheap. I used the tool to replace the band on my moto 360 and in the gusto of my excitement I put the band in upside down! While trying to undo this, the metal surrounding the pin on the watch band bent but the pin tool is unscathed. The watch band material seems more fragile quality than that of the tool.The band still works fine after I had to slightly mangle to get the pin out and is well worth the $15! Plus I dint even know a screen protector came with everything! I highly recommend this band as long as you install it right the first time. Even if you don't it works perfectly fine slightly bent metal and all!"
5.0,"Muy cómodas, secado rápido."
5.0,This is my first Newsboy type hat and I really like the way it looks and feels.
5.0,Love!!!!!! Highly recommend. Great for any Potter fan :)
5.0,My bf loved it amd wears his as a necklace
5.0,"Masks fit well, are large enough, and straps adjust to be long enough not to pull on my ears. Some more expensive masks are too tight, and these are great. They also send a piece to hold the mask in place for extended mask wearing times."
5.0,These socks are perfect for those Office fans.
5.0,like their products
5.0,I like my chain very much. Nice sterling silver.
5.0,"For the price, this wig was great!  It did not look just like the picture...I had to trim the bangs a bit and spray sine hair spray on it but then it looked great!  I was worried about wearing it all day at work as I knew it would probably be itchy and move around a lot but it did neither!  I was pleasantly surprised!  I wore it all day and into the night and it never bothered me at all.  Every once in awhile, I would find a hair here or there but it didn't fall out much at all."
5.0,Beautiful I think it is an older style...
5.0,"I love these. I wear them everyday to work as a server in the muggy heat of New Orleans, and they help keep my work shirt from sticking to me in very gross looking and uncomfortable ways."
5.0,"❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️The black, size medium fits snug.  5'2&#34;, 120lbs. Nice thick jersey lining & unlined beautiful delicate lace sleeves.  This shirt is a little stretchy so it fits nice."
5.0,Perfect ! Good compression in the tummy area and the flare crop is so cute for spring and summer
5.0,"I bought this for my elderly dad who is  always cold - well, not at night, anymore!  This soft, luxuriously thick,  and well-made nigbtshirt keeps him toasty all night!  It does run slightly large, but that makes it easy to move around in the bed.  I’m ordering another for Christmas."
5.0,Comfy & cute! Soooo cute i bought a pair also for my 7yr old daughter. Twinning! She loves them too.
5.0,Purchased for teaching demonstrations. Fits well; not overly large like some styles. Soft fabric that is wrinkle-free if taken from the dryer promptly.
5.0,"I wear short dresses, so the sweater is great for use in the warmer climates.  It's a great light feel."
5.0,Very soft and comfortable. The length is above knee so you decide what works for you. Im 5ft so the length does not bother me. The burgungy is beautiful
5.0,"Fit as expected, great material, my kid wears them everyday to school."
5.0,Thick and comfy pjs
5.0,"These are well made, comfortable men's jeans. The material is soft, stretchy, and durable. The seams look great. They fit well and the style is very similar to skinny jeans (but a little looser). The light color with the fake &#34;wear&#34; patterns looks great, and overall the style of these jeans is very modern. I would say these jeans run true to size. I don't know what the actual price will be (as there is no price posted on the product page at this time), but I assume these will be mid-priced, which would be appropriate for jeans of this style, quality, and brand."
5.0,"Love this! Put together well, not flimsy and can go on wrist or ankle with the adjusting strings!"
5.0,"The belt looks and feels great. The leather quality is good and it doesn't look or feel cheap. The reinforced holes will help the belt keep its shape for long time. I've read some of the other reviews but after several months I'm not having any problems with the belt. I wear it about once every week. Still a little stiff after 2 months.  I wear a size 14/16 pants and I buckle on the 5th hole. I purchased a XL, could have purchased a LG instead."
5.0,Perfect accent piece.  Just what I was looking for.  Love it.
5.0,"Very Comfortable and they are machine washable! They are not tight around your knees, I'm very happy with them.  The colors in the picture are the colors I received, 2 black and 1 navy"
5.0,Very small but so pretty! I never have to worry about washing my face and my hoop coming out now.
5.0,Got this for my son for his birthday absolutely loved it
5.0,This is perfect for my bestie! She loves Starbucks and into the Wiccan things in life. This was perfect for her!
5.0,It's a sturdy case.
5.0,Tan lindo que decidí quedármelo
5.0,beautiful! the material is very nice not real thin. lots of compliments and love the pockets. Wish they had in different patterns rather than flower and colors are too light for my preference or I'd buy more!
5.0,They are the best ones that I have ever bought
5.0,"My son loves Inside Out. And he loves Anger most of all, so when I spotted these, I knew we had to have them. They fit well, wear well, and go easily from day to night fashion... oh yeah, he wears them everywhere. These are a great value and great quality. The fabric is breathable and soft, but also survives frequent washings."
5.0,"Cute little necklace for any Swifty. Chain is a bit long for my tiny neck, but having previously worked in the jewelry making/beading industry, it was an easy fix for me."
5.0,I bought this for my wife and she loves it
5.0,Received many complements.
5.0,I traveled through Germany and Poland for a week on business. Used this as my wallet. Very happy overall. Will use again.

5.0,Great shoes! My favorites
5.0,I love this. It looks pretty great.
5.0,"I love these nightgowns. 100% cotton is important to me and I’m glad these are available. The lace isn’t scratchy in the least. I can’t even figure it out. It’s just as soft as the nightgown. No irritating tags, either. Highly recommend this nightgown."
5.0,Wearing. I like  them just to big.
5.0,This is an amazing costume and I received a lot of compliments on it!!! Unfortunately the jacket piece is very small. I had to wear a shirt underneath it and then use gold string to loop between the buttons and holes to keep it closed. The pants fit true to size and were comfortable.
5.0,Adorable! true to size.
5.0,Great stylish product.
5.0,Perfect small necklace for my 5 year okd granddaughter.
5.0,"These leggings are extremely comfortable, flattering, and perfect for the gym!"

5.0,"Love this bracelet, beautifully made, wear it all the time."
5.0,Well made and very cute
5.0,"Love Patty Boutik products and this dress is just what I wanted.  Very comfortable, good quality, and great style.<br />I’m 5’10” around 140-150 lbs and large fits me comfortably (I don’t like things too tight and this is loose, but not baggy)."
5.0,To funny
5.0,Fits great feel great smooth
5.0,"I love the low back strap closure. Unique. I've been using Champion for sports bras, but the material of this one feels more....breathable... haven't tested yet, will update in case 5 stars is not accurate"
5.0,"Just what I was looking for. I love that these aren't too long, they are the perfect length. Finally no material bunching up.  They are lightweight, but definitely have a good hold.  My calves are 14"" and the lrg/xl fit nicely.  I wore these on a hot muggy day and I did not feel suffocated or sweaty.  The bands on the top and bottom are not tight at all.  Will definitely be purchasing more."
5.0,Really vibrant color..size perfect.<br />Delivery took a few weeks
5.0,"I’m OBSESSED!! I bought this in white for my college graduation and it fit perfectly. It’s the perfect summer-y dress for any occasion. You can dress it up or down. I think it’s a great dress and will be keeping it in mind, maybe buying it again in another color, for other occasions I have coming up!! Get this dress 😊"
5.0,This coin was exactly what I expected. I love it so much and bring it with me on all my travels.
5.0,I love this hat. It’s comfortable and stylish.
5.0,Fits perfect and made me look slimmer than I actually am! My boyfriend loved it!
5.0,Product work as described
5.0,"It's pretty.  It's light.  You can hardly feel it on your wrist.  I like the blue strap.  So far has been right on time with my IPhone.  Oh ya, one thing.  It is Not luminous!  It does not shine in the dark; even though it looks like a shine in the dark model.  So the ad is wrong.<br />rr"
5.0,I like the fit of these sweats.  Great for hanging around at home.  They did not shrink when I washed them.
5.0,As advertised.  Works well
5.0,I really like this sweater. It is a nice and soft material ( sometimes these sweaters can be thin and a little cheap feeling- this one is not) it is a little boxy at the bottom but all in all I like it. I ordered a large
5.0,"My wife absolutely loves these.  She shows them off to all the other nurses, they all want them too."
5.0,"i know this says its a womens watch but I bought it as a gift for my nine year old grandson and it is perfect. he loves it!! The built in light is just bright enough, and the hands are easy for him to read. The size of the watch is also perfect for a kid. The band is sturdy too, and I am very happy with this purchase."
5.0,My lil niece loved them. Thank you !
5.0,Very pleased. Arrived much sooner than anticipated. There was no logo on it and quality was very good.
5.0,good length
5.0,Truly recommend and they fit true to size for me! :)
5.0,"Hello all, this fits me perfectly because I have a narrow foot, but it may not be comfortable for you if you have wide feet. I purchased the kelly green shoes to pair with a classic black dress. I added a cute kelly green tassle necklace to tie everything together for an easy vacation outfit. I walked all over New Orleans and they were so comfortable that I ordered a pair in the tan and black. For some reason, the tan pair felt a bit tighter and were not as comfortable. I felt that I could go up a half size in the tan color. This may be why there is some discrepancy in the reviews in regard to the fit of the shoe. Please be aware that there is no arch support. If you are like me and wear flip flops all day, you will be very happy with these as they feel like you are not wearing anything. Also, the straps are very breathable. I took a trip to Memphis and walked all over the city with no shoes except these in 3 different colors."

5.0,Really adorable! Worked great! Thank you!
5.0,"I absolutely love this ring. It is lightweight and comfortable. It took me little while to get use to the feeling of wearing it. The block pattern rubbed in between my fingers oddly at first. After a few days, I would not even tell I had it on.<br /><br />I wear a size 5.5 ring. I purchases a size 5. It was easy to slide on and off. I plan to purchase two more in my wedding colors!"
5.0,"This is a wonderful dress! It fits great, looks gorgeous, feels quality, and is just the right length. I’m 5’10”, a muscular 195 lbs, and the medium fit perfectly."
5.0,I’m 5’2” 140lbs and normally a size 6 in women’s clothing.  I read the reviews that said to size down and ordered a Small and they fit perfect.  I plan on purchasing other colors!
5.0,The perfect little bag that can hold your necessities! The quality of the bag feels good and looks nice. I would recommend to a minimalist.
5.0,"I get hot easy so I wish I would have got something cotton, but this was fine. Nicely made. I wore it home from the hospital after having my son."
5.0,Super cute and well made
5.0,"Love this dress!  Very classy, can't wait to wear this dress to a wedding. I bought a small, and I usually wear a small in us sizes. Fit is loose but I think that's the style.  Amazing!"

5.0,Very soft & comfortable and keeps you very warm
5.0,"We loved them... my husband and I had to SHARE, but otherwise great fit. I’m a Nurse, he had puffy ankles. They worked for us"
5.0,"Very comfortable, its like wearing pajamas. Love it"
5.0,I wore this dress to a work dinner in Las Vegas. It was classy yet fun for Vegas. The off shoulders and lace detail made the dress my favorite!

5.0,"They fit great, look awesome, and the price was very fair. I am happy with my purchase."
5.0,This dress is gorgeous. I didn’t wear it for my big day because I had another dress that fit just right but this one was in my top 3.
5.0,My Sweetie and I wore our shirts to a Valentine's Party and everyone loved them!
5.0,Very cute dress!
5.0,Great products! Bought them in green and watermelon. These are much cheaper than other products but overall a good product.
5.0,"Love this dress!  However, it tends to ride up due to the length.  It will show any imperfections your may have, however, be confident and rock that shiz ladies!"
5.0,I have been looking everywhere for yellow shoes to match what I wear. Never could find yellow shoes.<br />I have usted the brand in several different colors so I knew I wojuld like it.
5.0,"Love the leather smell. My boyfriend wanted a thin wallet, like a THIN one. So I shopped around for something that was thin enough but also had enough pockets. This one fit the bill and works great for him. And did I mention the smell? The leather is great."
5.0,"Beautiful.  I get compliments daily. It is definitely a conversation starter.  The band is pretty large, but if you have the proper equipment it is easily resized.  I would recommend for any watch lover, not just women."
5.0,"Extremely happy with the quality and appearance of this band. I picked the light brown Italian leather strap. It doesn't have the quick release pins but that wasn't important to me. The color looks great with my watch. I really like the fact that the band is 22mm wide but it's notched off at the ends to fit between the 18mm lugs of the Huawei. This was a must for me because, as a guy, an 18mm band is just too narrow. I've washed my hands several times while wearing it and even though it's gotten wet, it doesn't show any spots or any problems from getting wet. Very pleased, I'm considering the black Italian band next."
5.0,"I really like this band, it makes the Apple Watch look dressier and not so sporty anymore. Easy to follow instructions and came in right on time :)"
5.0,"The sweater is super lightweight and comfortable. The sweater can be used for business casual attire, casual day wear, or business attire. Long enough to cover your “back area”, two pockets in the front, and loose. I purchased a large and it fit perfect."
5.0,Beautiful although too small for me.....will use as a scarf accessory
5.0,"Love this suit, its classy perfect for my curves and great coverage. One of my favorite suites thus far. 5'2, 136lb ordered a medium."

5.0,My wife looks really hot with this
5.0,"Love this in so many ways!! You can wear it as a shaw or a scarf. Its long, shear,  yet thick enough to keep your neck warm,well made, looks just like the picture!"
5.0,Great pair of white pants.  Super comfy and i love the draw string at the ankles.  Downfall is they material is super thin. Beware you see everything that is underneath so be conscious of what panties you wear.
5.0,I like the design and color combination. I am not disappointed.
5.0,"My husband loves anything ""Viking"" and this ring did not disappoint. The pattern is very attractive and color is vibrant. I ordered a size 9 and it fit him perfectly. He is very happy with his new ring!!"
5.0,Perfect fit and as expected.
5.0,I had bought the dido smart watch but didn't like the band with a buckle. Speidel Twist O Flex has been a tried and true for many years.
5.0,"My 6 year old granddaughter wanted a robe just like mom mom's and it wasn't easy to find.  I checked out JCP, Kohl's, Macy's and a few other online sites but no luck.  She wears this robe around the house all the time to keep her warm and comfy.  She wears a size 6 and ordered the same size and fit her with a little growing room."
5.0,They fit perfectly and actually stay put!
5.0,"Thicker then expected, good quality. Very happy with this!"
5.0,It’s beautiful than I thought. I put it on and it’s not irritate my ear. I buy the blue color and thinking to buy another pink.
5.0,Had to add a link a couple links to make it fit but I love it.
5.0,"I have been looking for a black sweatshirt that was good quality. I had read reviews in other places that these sweatshirts run a little small. I typically wear a small, so I ordered a medium in this sweatshirt. It fits exactly how I want! It has a little room to wear layers under it, but it isn't too baggy. I love this sweatshirt. Just order a size larger than you would usually wear."
5.0,"My wife loves this apron, she wears it everyday while cooking and even for doing housework, she tells me it's very good quality and she likes the two front pockets"
5.0,Nice quality looks just like pic
5.0,"It fit great and the quality was very nice.  It arrived promptly and I look forward to wearing it.  Overall, a little pricey but it definitely is better than the regular &#34;costume quality&#34; ones out there.  I wish it were like... $20 cheaper because I think that would make it &#34;priced right&#34; but overall, I'm definitely not complaining."
5.0,"I have been extremely satisfied with these shirt stays. I have never used shirt stays before so I have nothing to compare them too, but these perform excellently and are very comfortable. I have to wear dress shirts at work, and my job requires a lot of walking, sitting, and standing, so I often find that my shirt is no longer properly tucked in. I try to maintain a professional image and a sloppily tucked in shirt doesn't fit into that profile. These do the job perfectly, and my shirt stays in place all day.<br /><br />As for comfort, I have been very happy with how little I notice these while I am wearing them. I don't notice them rubbing against my skin, and I have no problems with them causing any kind of chafing or abrasions. The metal clips that attach to the shirt are smooth and don't catch on my pants, and the loop that goes around my heal is thin enough that I don't notice it at all in my shoe.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with these and would certainly purchase them again.<br /><br />I did receive these shirt stays for a reduced price. I enjoy reviewing and critiquing products, and do my best to provide a objective and unbiased opinion​ for all of the items that I review."
5.0,Vestido hermoso! Quedó perfecto!
5.0,I am VERY busty so picking out dresses are sometimes a hit or miss for me. I ordered a 2x and the dress fit perfectly. I am about a size 12 body wise (not considering my breasts) so I had plenty of room in the other areas of the dress. It was just short enough. I couldn't bend over too far (lol) but otherwise it is a nice length. Zipper stayed zipped too!!! The dress can be dressy or casual. I will be order the other colors! :)
5.0,Silky but had a 2xl and normally wear a large
5.0,"Love! So cute, bright and fun colors and seem like pretty good quality! I got them for gifts/favors and suspect guests will love them! Definitely recommend for the great value"
5.0,This is the perfect fit and so comfortable.
5.0,"I swore that I wouldn't be able to find this type of bracelet for my fitbit blaze since I haven't seen it being sold around anymore. But I found this brand and it is of excellent quality. The bracelet was too big for me though. Granted, I do have really skinny wrists. On the brightside (and really well thought of), they have a kit to adjust the size of it! This came as a surprise to me as I just expected the bracelet. So now I adjusted it and it fits perfectly. Looks amazing as well!"
5.0,These earrings are attractive and well made but they're much larger than I expected.  They'd be appropriate for evening or exotic wear or for someone more flamboyant than I.
5.0,I've been using them for a few days now and have noticed that my eyes don't get as tired.  Love the tint to cut the 'blue'!  Thank you!
5.0,My son has had these for a while now. They have been great. Several machine washes later. He loves them and I am happy they have lived up to my expectations.
5.0,This was a gift for my husband.  Fits well and good quality
5.0,Great deal. I bought a pack for my teenage daughter. They fit great. She has a variety of colors and they are full coverage.
5.0,First vsco girl product I purchased and she loves it!
5.0,"Too bulky and big for me, but otherwise cute and durable."
5.0,Super soft! Love the pattern!
5.0,Lovely necklace
5.0,"I like the feel of this material, it's soft, but also wicks sweat away from the body, making for a comfy feel while walking/hiking! I also like the sleeve length, long enough to keep out the chill when I start my hikes/walks, but short enough to let out the heat as I warm up! These will be fantastic come fall! They fit beautifully, too, without any binding of movement. VERY happy with these tops! Two thumbs up from me!"
5.0,"Buenísimo ya he comprado varios, me llegaron a tiempo y seguiré comprando para regalos, mantiene el beeper del vehículo seguro y fuera de golpes y peligro."
5.0,"I've searched for a purse that is durable, lightweight, but could hold a lot for your average day that offered a decent number of pockets for organizational purposes - this is it!"
5.0,Great shades!!
5.0,"It is made of old bike tubes but actually it looks beautiful. I've received compliments on it. It has been very durable (daily use for over a year). I carry a lot of cards, and now it is beginning to lose its shape a little. I'll probably replace it with the same thing as I've really liked it. It's an easy way to be green and vegan ..."
5.0,Love these. Add a little cuteness when wearing flats it’s they peek out.
5.0,"I got constant compliments in this cute skirt. Mind the wrinkles, I took these pics after a night out dancing.  I'm 5'7, 188lbs and wear a size 12 so I ordered the large as to make sure it wasn't too tight and ride up. Although there's distressing in the front and back, your goodies won't show."
5.0,I love it!!!!! It's very comfortable and looks exactly like the picture. I brought a size up so that the shorts were not too tight and they fit perfectly!!!! By the way Im a curvy women and I wear a DD cup! I hope this helps. I'm going to get another one just a different color.
5.0,My daughter really liked them. They are so pretty
5.0,I LOVVEDDD THESE. Perfect buy!!!!
5.0,Much better looking in person than in picture.
5.0,"Excellent Socks for Cycling in Warm / Hot Weather !<br />The Size / Sizing Chart calls for the Size Medium Socks to Fit up to Men's Size 9.  My Feet measure Exactly Size 9 on the Brannock Foot Scale and these Medium Socks do fit, but are just a Little smaller than Defeet AirEator 1 inch Socks that I got through Road ID which were just ever so slightly larger.<br />Otherwise Excellent Socks which do wick away sweat and have no bothersome seams to annoy in Tight fitting Cycling Shoes.  Recommend these for Cycling !<br />Just watch it, if your feet are the slightest bit larger than Size 9, you might just want to go a large ?<br />Fast Shipping.  Thank You !"
5.0,My neighbor want some leggings so I order her a couple pairs of these as well as one set for me. I found then to be a little large for me (although I am loosing weight) So I ordered a medium (waiting for those to arrive) I do like the weight of the material and the feel. I would recommend the to my friends for sure they feel really good on and silky.
5.0,Product as described and easy to see at the airport
5.0,Great glasses for working on the computer
5.0,"Stylish, I get so many compliments at work!"
5.0,Small fit as expected. Great product for the price. Cute and fuzzy.with lining. No tears in seams. Warm enough for mid to low 30's. No problems with metal zipper. Nice style.
5.0,"True to size, not too short and comfortable high-rise waist. Great for lounging, sleeping or under dresses/skirts. Will probably buy more."
5.0,"Just got it. looks awesome, looks durable but we shall see. for 10 bucks I might just order a spare."
5.0,They fit perfectly as earrings! I love the backs of them. Would recommend.

5.0,Girlfriend loved it!
5.0,These sterling silver bar stud earrings are exactly what is pictured on the product page.  They seem to be well made and look very nice.  The tiny cubic zirconia diamonds give off nice hints of sparkles.
5.0,Very beautiful necklace
5.0,My daughter bought this for me for grandma day. My first grandchild was born in August. I’ve got our 3 birthstones and the grande/mother/daughter.
5.0,"Love this--The little charms are so petite and cute. It's very flattering. My favorite part is that the actual length is somewhat adjustable, so you can wear it tight and as a choker sometimes or you can also wear it a little bit looser near the collar. It's fantastic for layering."
5.0,It is a great beloved holder. Lost 2 gloves with the last holder I got.  Very happy.
5.0,"This piece is almost 42mm diameter and just over 1mm width, not thin or flimsy, it is very nicely engraved front and back. The black &#34;string&#34; is strong and simple but fully adjustable and compliments the bronze. I would purchase again."
5.0,I love this sweater. I love everything about it but it is made small. I normally wear a 2X and ordered a 3X based on the reviews. It fits but is not long enough and way more snug than what I like. Definitely size up when ordering it.
5.0,"I thought it was a unique gift , pretty cool how fingertips lit up.  I gave it as a Christmas gift to one of my nieces whom the other wanted one."
5.0,"It’s nice and soft! I also love the little rabbits foot? that came on here, it wasn’t advertised!"
5.0,"Was really impressed with the whole thing, material fit and price...highly recommend"

5.0,"I am normally a size 810 US sizing, so for this dress I ordered it in an extra large and it fits great, I really like this dress it was very affordable and I have worn it to two rather fancy functions and if you put on some great jewelry or a fun hat or scarf etc. it actually looks very designer and I love it"
5.0,"DID NOT RECEIVE SHOES. RYKA ARE GREAT WATER SHOES BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED THIS COLOR.  DID NOT RECEIVE THEM,!!!!!"
5.0,My daughter liked it. It's one of her favorite outfit going out now.
5.0,Hi quality great looking
5.0,We love this brand. I was so excited to find these socks on Amazon as I was in a pinch before picture day.
5.0,"I first saw it in a store and immediately fell in love, but didn't want to (couldn't) spend the money on such a thing... I finally decided to go for it since it was half price... totally worth it! It's beautiful & well made. If you're like me and love to squeeze a lot of tiny things into a tiny bag, this one is right for you!<br /><br />PS: arrived super fast! I'm a very happy customer 😊"
5.0,Got these for my granddaughter. She is a huge Ryan fan. She loves them even though they look like they are for boys. It would be nice to have some girls versions/colors.

5.0,Just like the picture. I'm 5'11/ 150 lbs and a medium fits perfectly. Haven't washed it yet so I don't know if it shrinks. Perfect for lounging around the house in.
5.0,These masks are as beautiful as masks can be.  They are easy to breathe through and are super comfortable!  I have tried several different mask types and brands and these are definitely my favorite.

5.0,"This dress was very nice for the price! can be dressed up with a nice necklace and nice shoes. I am short(5'1"") and the small fit above my knee. If you are tall, I'm not sure it would be long enough. The material has a bit of stretch and flows nicely. Not form fitting at all, which is what I wanted."
5.0,su comodidad y eficacia en mejorar la circulación sanguínea en los pie y piernas
5.0,LOVE!!!! I WILL BE ORDERING MORE COLORS.

5.0,Love this dress it fits perfectly. I wear a size 8 / 10. I'm smaller on top. I bought a size 10 for it runs smaller than the actual size. I'm happy with the fit.
5.0,"Makes my chest look so good! Does what it's supposed to. Not so much a everyday bra, but definitely good for a night out or if you need a boost of sexiness in your life."
5.0,"Perfect size, great stocking stuffer"
5.0,I absolutely loved this package with all of the vintage earrings.
5.0,I love this bag. Nice fit and lots of Pockets to organize your things. Big enough to take your iPad and still have room for more. Definitely my favorite business travel bag!
5.0,"Although my son was born at a little over 7lbs., he is very small.  He has trouble fitting everything from clothes to accessories.  We tried a number of different items for the car seat in order to keep his head stable.  This has been by far the best one.  Now, I can look at him in the mirror while I am driving and be confident that he is having a peaceful ride without hurting his neck.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do."

I didn't exactly know what I wanted, but as soon as I spotted this [[ASIN:B000UTL8NO Sterling Silver Bar and Bead Stations Necklace - 17""]] I knew it was THE ONE.  It was claimed to be a one-hundred dollar necklace and it was on sale for under twenty dollars!  I couldn't pass that up!

5.0,Love these pants. I got the  small size and it was just a little too small so I got the medium size. I love the way they fit and flow. If I were being nit picky I would combine the way the medium size fits in the waist and the length from the small. That being said I love them both.

5.0,"This dress is so cute & flattering. The material is kinda stretchy but not itchy, very comfortable. I thought the light purple color was very pretty."
5.0,"These socks live up to their description.  I love them, they are not so thick that they make your shoes too tight, and they do help with sweaty feet!  Love them."
5.0,Quality is fine no issues. Nice drapey shawl. Makes a little tank top a bit demure without weighting down the look. Like a scarf
5.0,"They are slightly smaller than I anticipated but my girls loved them and they got their Pandora bracelets, both the silver and leather, wonderfully."
5.0,"A great watch. I wanted something simple to keep track of time, and this does it. I didn't want anything fancy. I was sick of pulling out my huge phone for what used to be a simple task. Bought one for my boyfriend as well, and he would agree. Will replace as necessary."
5.0,"I typically wear a size Medium US women’s clothes. I ordered a size large after I read the sizing chart, it fits perfect not too tight and not loose at all. The adjustable wrap around straps are very comfortable. I easily wore it for a whole day without any problems. I found it gave me a great deal of lower back support which is very important for me."
5.0,"Maybe the storms back east slowed down the shipping a bit but when they finally arrived they met my expectations. I wanted large, sexy librarian with vintage style and these glasses are all that!"
5.0,"My own fault that I had thought these were actually a Wiley X product they are not. That’s on me, it’s plainly shown to be another manufacturer.<br /><br />I’m not sure if you can still get actual Wiley X replacement lens for this model so this might be one of the only options. I do not know if these are OSHA approved safe like the Wileys or ballistic rates. They might be I don’t know.<br /><br />They fit into the frames just fine and unlike my old lens they aren’t all scratched up. As long as they stay that way I’m satisfied."
5.0,Awesome watch.  Work watch
5.0,Item was well made
5.0,The material is a very soft sleek fabric. I can tell if it's taken care of properly it will last a long time. I washed it in cold water and then let it air dry. The colors are great and there's so many to choose from. This shirt could be worn with jeans or even with a skirt for a night out. The sleeves drape nicely down the sides and create a pretty fit. This shirt would work great for all ages. It's versatile for all types of fashion preferences.<br /><br />I  expected it to be really small but it was just slightly smaller than expected. It fits nicely. I recommend buying one size larger than you normally would.  I may even get  a few more colors since it's so soft and comfortable.  I received this item at a discount or free in exchange for my honest review.
5.0,"Super cute, super comfy casual dress. I was actually really happy about the fact that not only did this fit me, it was like a perfect length. It would probably not wear it as a dress alone, but more with a set of capri leggins under it just for my comfort, but it could be worn many different ways I believe. It could be dressed or or dressed down for almost any occasion. The top part is tight enough to not fall down, but not loose enough to be saggy. The dress material itself is super soft and comfortable and breathes very well. I don't want to say it feels like silk, but it is super soft on the skin. I am a shorter person so the length goes to about my knees, but that is okay with me because I am not alright with having it short because I would probably not wear it if it was. I would definitely recommend this to just about anyone, but take heed that if you are super heavy in the bust, finding a bra to hold everything could be difficult.<br />I received this item at a discounted price for an honest product review."
5.0,"Cute band, perfect fit and so glad it's adjustable. I have such a tiny wrist and my Samsung smartwatch is actually to big for my wrist so thanks to the band I wear it much higher. I have 2 more in different colors I will change out come winter. Only thing I don't like is when it gets wet it makes me itch under the band so I have to take it off and let it dry."
5.0,"Bought this for wife and she likes it. She wears them in the house a lot other than the gym, so I guess they're some pretty comfy house pants lol"
5.0,"Just beautiful, received many compliments."
5.0,Most comfortable work shoes I own!
5.0,"I bought these as a random, happy gift for a friend/coworker that introduced me to reversible sequins. Once I checked them out and tried them on, I didn't want to give them away. She LOVED them. And I'm ordering more. A bit of a sequin was lost here and there, as I expected from having worked with sequined fabrics before. Youth Large = Adult S/M."
5.0,These earrings are adorable. What a deal! Nice quality!
5.0,Looks very nice.
5.0,This isn't a cheap mat. Got it for my hubby for Christmas and he LOVES it.
5.0,"Lovely dress! My daughter is delighted with the twirly quality, the luxuriously silky yet not-too-thin fabric, and the rich color.  She wore it immediately, then again as soon as it was clean. Really cute with a jean jacket and boots!"
5.0,The fit well and are nice and thick for winter use.
5.0,Nice perfect timing just for Halloween
5.0,My 4yr old lil girl loves it.
5.0,The dress fit perfectly.
5.0,Absouloutley perfect
5.0,Great shirt!! Washes up nicely. Light weight! Didn’t shrink.
5.0,"Super cute!! I bought one for me and one for my Mom, we love them!"
5.0,"Have been looking for this style in a big size, perfect! Great quality too."
5.0,just beautifully fit
5.0,I wore these for an outdoor wedding in June where i sweated a lot! These stuck all day and into the night. I would definitely recommend this!
5.0,Looks and fits great. I love it so much that I plan on buying more of this tank in different colors.
5.0,Lookds great
5.0,Awesome gloves! Fit perfect
5.0,My favorite top!
5.0,This is gorgeous.  Just love it.
5.0,Love it! So pretty and love the material!
5.0,Super cute and it worked for my Christmas party! Actually size
5.0,Love how the technology of vionic shoes and sandals help my feet feel completed comfortable.
5.0,It is one of my favorite new shirts.  I use it as an under shirt and a work out shirt.  It is just comfortable
5.0,"So cute, fits great. Just the right amount of detail"
5.0,This fit me perfectly. I’m 5’8 179lbs. I got a size large and these fit me like a glove. They were the perfect length on the arms which is a big factor for me as I’m a nurse and will wear these everyday at work in the freezing cold hospitals. They were not too long or short on the torso and hug the body really well.
5.0,"Order at least 1 size up. But otherwise it's great. If I was any bigger,  I wouldn't order this at all. If you're bigger than a large as you would normal see in the store,  even a 2x is probably going to be too tight.  I wear a LG usually,  but based on reviews I ordered a 2x, and it fits just right. I got it in blue and red and they both look great."
5.0,Very nice. Looks nice! Looks just like the picture
5.0,"They fit great the elastic has little ""clips"" to adjust how tight it fits. Wash great."
5.0,"Good quality, strong, heavy, shiny...for an excellent price!"
5.0,"very nice, comfy shoes!"
5.0,These have been My favorite glasses fo far.. They are dark and formed to fit my face i can wear them on the motorcycle and not worry that they are going to fly off.
5.0,This is such a beautiful and good quality bangle!! Well worth the money!!
5.0,My favorite cotton pajamas! So comfortable and cute!
5.0,"very nice and super comfortable, but they are a little bit small. Super cute"
5.0,I got this as an anniversary gift for my spouse who loves watches. He was thrilled with it. It looked just like the pictures.
5.0,Love my Carolina Panthers McCaffrey shirt. Roomy & comfy. Very nicely made.
5.0,The quality is excellent. Firm and sturdy feel as you walk.
5.0,"This is the best t- shirt I’ve ever had!!  It is so comfortable.  The fabric is super soft, and not stiff at all.  It’s not tight fitting, but is not super loose, which makes it very flattering.  The fabric is not clingy so it’s great for some one who’s fluffy, like me :-). I’m between a 34 and 36C and a medium fit perfectly.  The sleeves come about halfway down your arm, which I like, but if you like shorter sleeves, they also look good rolled up.  I am definitely buying more of these!"
5.0,Amen
5.0,Good quality and sturdy. Beautifully made.
5.0,Sturdy little pins that held up great.
5.0,Comfortable slippers for around the house.  Way better than barefoot on my knees and flat feet.
5.0,"I'm a size 6 and ordered Med, and am happy to say this sweater fit perfectly.  The weave is not too thin nor cheap.  It is thick enough to be a Spring sweater.  The fit is nice and loose all through the tummy.  The sleeves have a slight puff, but not too much to be early 2000's fashion.  The lavender color is a lovely purple and it is not a ""cheap"" shade like so many imported sweaters are.  This sweater looks like something you would find in a TJMaxx: nice enough and pretty and a good price."
5.0,These are the best pants!
5.0,"I bought my daughter a similar hat that I paid over double the price than I paid for this one and I like this one better. It’s a really warm hat and is very well-made. I like that tassel on the top is removable, too."
5.0,Perfect for my Safari Man cosplay. Must get for every Filthy Frank fanatic. Nyesss.
5.0,"This shirt is exactly as described. It’s lightweight, sleeves are plenty long and it’s long enough to wear with leggings. For reference I am 5’0, 150 and I ordered a large."
5.0,she loved it because it is nice and warm.  and she likes the length.. .. ....... ............ ...... .. . . . . . . . . . . .
5.0,"This is the look! So excited. Unique, stealthy, modern, polarized. Adds the &#34;Wow!&#34;"
5.0,Besides it being a funny messed up shirt it does fit well and the material is quality.
5.0,Love this gorgeous bracelet!!! So hope it comes back in stock!!!
5.0,"Love, love, love this shirt.  RIP Mr. Wilder."
5.0,fit great all around flowers are well done  are great cap sleeve is great fabric great  nice weight to fabric so so perfect mo
5.0,"I cannot believe how many compliments I rec'vd from strangers the first time I wore it!  It is lovely, well made and gives just the right amount of &#34;sparkle&#34;.  I will buy this again in other colors."
5.0,Light weight but very warm. Exactly what I was looking for. Love this coat. Zipper sticks a little in one place but has not been an issue.
5.0,Very pretty & well made!
5.0,This dress is lovely.  It fits as the size chart and the fabric is thick and the color is actually chicken yellow not mustard as it seems in the picture.
5.0,"Much cheaper than retail department stores, received as described, no pinching and magnet  holds band in place, easy to install. Well worth the price & good quality."
5.0,"Simple instructions, easy to use and VERY effective. Used on two new pair of quality shoes. No fuss, No muss. Highly recommended."
5.0,"I was looking for a white top to wear in my family picture. This top is a little thin, but fit great and comfortable. It looked beautiful in the pictures and I can wear it with jeans."
5.0,true to size. perfect for dresses or tanktops
5.0,"Nice built, reversable which work great, leather holds up well"
5.0,"Cloak better than expected.  With its substantial weight and lovely ""hang"", it is a classy alternative to the traditional coat.  The arm holes and pockets are proportionately placed, and the button placket is easy to button/unbutton.<br />It arrives, however, packaged in a ""blanket bag"", and, unfortunately, is very wrinkled."
5.0,I get nothing but compliments on this dress. It fits perfectly and the fabric feels great. I will definitely be buying more dresses from them.
5.0,If did not fit the 3x size we purchased was really a large.
5.0,Bought this dress and couldn't be happier. So comfortable and cute with the cut out sleeves!
5.0,exactly the way it should be!! LOVE IT!
5.0,Great shirts.  Very soft and fit well
5.0,Feel like high quality sunglasses for a low price!
5.0,"Great wallet for me. It is not too big or too small. It is also very durable. I am buying this design second time,my first was in black color. It lasted for me for about three years with moderate use. I am not a big fan of long fancy wallets that look like a mini- purse. It fits perfecly my small purse which is essantial when I am going outside with little kids. Fife stars. I am a second time byer. I love the color and quality."
5.0,"This little guy can fit enough cards, cash, and passports for a vacation. I can also fit my cell phone (maybe 2) in nearly every pocket. Description says that it is RFID blocking but I do not have a means to actually test that.<br />This item has an all-around zipper to protect against losing any items and is quite frankly a great product for traveling, especially internationally. It has a long neck band so you can wear it. Zippers are smooth and I love the little pen holder in the middle. Holds everything I need for my travels.<br /><br />The tag says “made in china”<br /><br />I received this item at a free/reduced price in exchange for an honest unbiased review."
5.0,I wear a 36c and have lats from lifting. Fit well!
5.0,I am in love with this gown. I am definitely buying more colors. The fit was perfect and the form flattering.
5.0,I was looking for Capri jeans with a fitted cuff  and these are them for half the price!  Great fit and flattering.
5.0,I could have went a size down but a very cute dress.  I received many compliments on it.
5.0,I usually wear a Large and got a 2x because of other reviews. Im glad I did. Its just a smidge big and very comfortable. I love it.
5.0,I like how thick the material is on these leggings! They stay in place and I have no worries about feeling &#34;see-through&#34;. The material and color feels slimming.
5.0,Great fit! I love these tops!
5.0,"I love this dress!  It is so comfortable and it looks great too!  I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs.  I ordered a small and it fits well."
5.0,"Best little wallet I have ever bought. I currently have about 6 credit cards in it, an access key card, drivers license, health insurance card and a could business cards and some cash and I am still able to slot it in my front pocket and feel like there is nothing. It is very durable so it won't bend awkwardly at some weird angle over time. I also like the neat draw string for pulling out the credit cards so you don't have to fidget looking for which one you can't to pull out."
5.0,PERFECT SIZE.  AMAZING HOW MUCH IT  WILL HOLD AND IS ORGANIZED VERY WELL.
5.0,Excellent fit.  Superior support.
5.0,Fits perfectly with my Pebble Steel. Got these to replace the original leather straps that came with the watch. Now wear the watch in the shower and while swimming in the pool. No problems so far.
5.0,"well made, over year use with groceries, nothing broken, handles solid not eve a tear with normal use. Only improvement would be  an easier zipper use but works well enough, for my purposes... ordered another set for backup or gift since have had lots of compliments on the bags and people in stores asking about it..."
5.0,LOVE THIS
5.0,Gave to my 10 year old granddaughter for Christmas (at her request). She wears it all the time snd loves it.
5.0,I bought this as stocking stuffer for daughter who plays softball.  The yellow with red thread looks exactly like the stitching on a softball in color/size/stitch spacing.  The reverse side is white so she can flip it to wear to her big brother's baseball games.  Super cute!
5.0,"Lovely color and feels great, very soft/silky and comfortable."
5.0,All what I expected. Thanks
5.0,I love the fit of this dress. I’m curvy and short- 5’2. The length of this dress is perfect. It does not cling to the body at all but isn’t too loose or see through. It isn’t too long at all and the side slits make the dress great for both the office or a wedding!
5.0,"Bought this for our patio in navy blue. Looks nice, fabric is water repellent, and seems pretty sturdy in moderate winds so far. We added weights, of course, but left it closed for about a week and it didn't even wobble. The mechanism is easy to use, if a little stiff. The open umbrella is not really high, which works fine for us since we don't plan to use it while standing, but something to keep in mind. The multiple tilt positions and the swivel is nice."
5.0,I love Boston Terriers!!! This is so Curt’s and well made. I highly recommend!
5.0,"I ordered the color gold, the packaging was poor but the necklace couldn't be anymore beautiful. It sits just like the picture and the necklace hasn't tarnished yet unlike some other necklaces I ordered from different vendors."
5.0,So cute and authentic.
5.0,"Very cute but classic dress! Perfect for work functions where I need to be a bit dressier than usual but not cocktail. You could absolutely dress it up though, if you did have a cocktail function to attend. Fits true to size, very nice quality, especially for this incredible price."
5.0,Nice hats for the money.
5.0,I love the support of the Vionic flip flops. They are great for helping with knee pain and are extremely comfortable.
5.0,Comfortable and easy to use.
5.0,Very comfortable lightweight cute dress
5.0,Awesome product!!! I used it to clean my pandora bracelet and it did an amazing job. The cloth is quite large so I am sure it will last a long time.
5.0,"For everyday use ,light weight and very comfortable."
5.0,"Excellent fit true to size. Order your normal size. No stretch in fabric, beautiful dusty pink. Very happy with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!!"
5.0,My girls and I absolutely love these scarves. I have even worn them to work myself and got compliments. Very satisfied!
5.0,Looks and fits great!
5.0,used these to expand my piercings and they worked perfectly like the way they should. the only thing about it is it comes in a bag that mixes up all of the sizes and some of the sizes are hard to differentiate from each other.
5.0,I love the locket. I am sure my daughter will like it.<br />It is one of her Christmas gifts.
5.0,"I’m 5”2 with a 36DD so basically nothing ever fits.  I ordered the XL with my fingers crossed because I needed it the day I got it.  While it was too long, otherwise it fit great and I was able to wear it without altering it.  It was not cheap costume material, the design was as it appears with the ability to tie the outer sleeves up or keep them down.  I would order it again for sure."
5.0,"I gave this as a gift to my friend whose daughter had just turned one.  She said she had already used two of the pairs and really liked it, especially during the winter months.  They were individually packaged and made a great gift."
5.0,"5’6”,  115 lbs,  32C,  bought smallest size<br /><br />I just got this, and absolutely love the way it looks on me, especially in the shorts because I typically don’t like the way normal bikini bottoms fit me. The top is super cute, but it slides around a little too much, and is see through, as there’s no lining. Overall I really really like it, but I’m worried once it’s worn in the water it’ll stretch out, so we’ll see."
5.0,This scarf is huge and very good quality. I've worn it numerous times around my head and have thrown it in the washer. The colors are also vibrant.
5.0,We used this for our daughter’s smash cake topper. Super cute !
5.0,Used one as a gift and kept two for myself
5.0,I ordered several sets and they were all as pictured. Bright colors and very cute!
5.0,Love these shorts and how they fit! Might get more pairs! I bought them for an upcoming trip! I can’t wait!!
5.0,"My 2 year old daughter LOVES these! Easy on and easy off, but they stay on all day!!"
5.0,Very warm in a 28 degree hunt
5.0,I lived the color.  I am giving it to my granddaughter for Christmas.  I'm sure she will like it.
5.0,"After actually receiving the correct product, I was sent the wrong thing at first, I was very satisfied with this purchase! The earrings are GORGEOUS! They are classically beautiful, not gaudy at all, they are the perfect size, and honestly, you can't even tell they aren't real. Best $6 I've ever spent! I'm wearing them now, and have been for weeks! You WILL be happy with these stunning, sparkling earrings!"
5.0,"Pleasantly surprised with the roomy fit!! Bought 4 pair total because they fit so well! I'm 5' 6.5&#34;, 128# (a little bottom heavy for my size though). Bought a size small. Long enough to not flood but not so long they'll drag in the bodily fluids that frequently land on the ground in the busy ER I work in. Enough pockets to carry all of my IV start supplies, flushes, tape & whatever else I pick up!"
5.0,"Great fit, durable, easy for my daughter to take off and on"
5.0,"So very flattering. I love that the buttons stay buttoned unless you want them undone, for date nyt. I normally wear a large ( I am 170ish lbs, 5,9in, ddd bust). I bought 1 in a med one in an XL. The med is perfect XL is baggy"
5.0,"The snaps sometimes come undone or are hard to put together, but worked as expected and fit good. I got an XL because I am almost 6 feet tall and curvy (215lbs)"
5.0,price vs quality was great.  Wig stayed on all day and fit well.  was very pleased.
5.0,We bought these for our daughters Spa birthday party! They worked great! I even monogrammed them and they turned out perfect!
5.0,i like the filters
5.0,"This is a beautiful shirt! Fits true to size, and is good quality."
5.0,Nice quality. Thin enough. Comfy. Used during hospital stay
5.0,"They match my granddaughter's boots. She loves the jacke, as do her parents. Need I say more?"
5.0,They are great sunglasses and seem to be holding up well. I love the shape and color as well as the case that was provided.
5.0,M encanta
5.0,"Great quality, durable, good materials and the size is just right if you want to make an accessory statement!"
5.0,"Really like it - I have a pair of bike shorts that are black that I wear under it, 5'8&#34;, just in case.  really like the pockets!"
5.0,It works as described
5.0,"PERFECT, IM 6T 2 ,260LBS  TALL IN THE TOP LOL"
5.0,I love these boots because they have that expensive look without paying the high price! They are comfortable and have cute detailing throughout. If you have wider calves these will fit over pants easily. They fit true to size and I love the gray color best!
5.0,"Gorgeous, better than the picture.  Love to wear these all the time and get lots of compliments on the earrings."
5.0,just to long
5.0,Love these bags!  They are big and very durable.  I was able to pack $200 worth groceries in them.  I love the metal clip it came with to hang them on the cart.  The patterns are so pretty.  I will buy more of these if I need them.
5.0,This is the perfect hoodie for being out on the water.<br />A perfect day of fishing with the perfect hoodie.<br />Absolutely comfortable and soft. Breathes easy and definitely worth it.<br />A must have for the casual or seasoned Fisherman.
5.0,these sweatpants are very cozy and comfortable to wear. I really love everything about them! They are very good quality and fit true to size. They didn’t shrink when I washed them and the Sherpa inside didn’t ball up.
5.0,Fits great. I love it.
5.0,Gives great support... especially when flying; not too tight
5.0,"The cups are sewn in, so there's no worry about them shifting or the hassle of having to put them back in through a tiny hole. The straps in the back have rubber sewn in inside them to keep their shape and provide support. The colors are exactly as pictured, and the stitching was on point."
5.0,Loved the way they fit on my feet ..have gotten q lot of compliments..and these are very comfortable as well
5.0,"These are my first Thomas & Vine, Just received them last night and tried them. No complaints so far. Will definitely order from this company again."
5.0,Beautiful!  Thanks.
5.0,It's beautiful!!
5.0,perfect for my dog's collar.
5.0,"Have to wait til after Christmas, because it’s a present"
5.0,This hat is great and fits perfectly if you have a large head like I do. The shipping is fast considering it's coming from China. Highly Reccomend
5.0,fit wash inside out
5.0,"Got for a gift and they loved it!! Color in the grey shirt is awesome, fit was perfect."
5.0,Perfect sunglasses for an active 4 year old. Wish there was a mobile tracking app available as we are on our 3rd pair.
5.0,Matches my mother of the bride dress for a Sept wedding.  I will have a loose updo and this is a perfect size for understated elegance.  Not too much blink.
5.0,well done 👏
5.0,"I love these lightweight pants, I wear them every where! I will be ordering more in other colors."
5.0,It’s so hard to find rose gold plated earrings that don’t turn! These stay! Thank you!
5.0,Love these shirts. I knew they ran small from prior reviews so ordered large and they fit just right. Normally I get small or medium. These are great buy for the price.
5.0,"Very nice jersey. I was very happy with the quality of it, way better than I expected. Not a game jersey but very nice, even has the fight strap. I'm a big guy 5'10"" 260, a 2xl is a little snug but not uncomfortably so. That was not a surprise though, I looked at the sizing chart and knew what I was getting. I would say it sizes about what you'd expect for a 2x. 5/5 would buy again in a heartbeat."
5.0,I love it cuz it covers great and it's Cher of course!! Perfect for any true Cher fan!
5.0,Unlike other silicone bands this is comfortable and does not make you sweat or leave a mark.
5.0,Awesome and comfortable
5.0,"Love it! It’s currently in witness protection. Hiding it from my daughter! Small bag, holds just the essentials"
5.0,Love loved it
5.0,😆The Glasses are better than what I expected
5.0,"This tee is very cute breathable, and stylish. It fits my frame well, and isn't too tight in any areas. Def recommend."
5.0,"I can't believe how many earings I recieved<br />and good back closures. Also the stainless steel doesn't hurt my ears like the coated ones.<br />It's sterling silver or stainless for my ears!!<br />Also have a tendency to loose one earing because I have long hair, these all match so you always have a mate for the lost one.<br />FANTASTIC VALUE!!!!"
5.0,"I’ve had several pairs of lender sunglasses now, and they are top notch. The polarization on these glasses is amazing. For the price, you can’t beat the quality!"
5.0,"100% will buy more! Exactly what I was looking for it makes a ting noise (been looking for), also spins, has skulls. And wont tarnish!!! I couldn't ask for anything more perfect."
5.0,"I have tried a lot of brands of readers.  While these were slightly higher priced it was money well spent,  I got them in 2.50 for working at my computer.  They are every bit as clear maybe even more so than glasses that I spent $100 from the name brand places.  Time will tell how long they last before scratching but for now I am pleased with these glasses.  Spend the extra money it is worth the clarity."
5.0,Work perfect for what I was wanting
5.0,Fit perfectly and super comfortable
5.0,Husband loved it.
5.0,It held the medallion I got for him just perfectly! Highly recommend.
5.0,Its a little odd at first hanging your beloved camera on your hip but it is comfortable and a lot of weight off your neck. The latching mechanism works fine and is a two handed release. Wear a good wide belt and I found that straddling the clamp over your side belt loop helps support the camera weight better.
5.0,"Well made, great feel to the material, flowy, fits real nice. Totally love it!!!"
5.0,Nice looking and fun to wear. And I should have bought more to gift.
5.0,"Lots of pocket, etc. Colour matches jeans. Love it."
5.0,"I love this soft, cute top. It is comfortable and stylish."
5.0,"I went back and forth on these shoes, mainly because of the price!!  But, they are LEATHER, for starters, and they are just as cool as HECK!!!  I wanted some more casual shoes, but I don't like the look of tennis shoes, and I'm short!!!  These give me a little lift and are much edgier than sneakers!!! I think if you have a wider foot bed, these might be a little snug on you, but I feel like they've already relaxed a little with my first wear. I have a true size 7 foot, and the size 7 fits perfect. They are worth every penny, trust me!!!"
5.0,"These socks worked great hiking in the Tetons and Yellowstone.  Highly recommend, especially for the price."
5.0,This is a great gift.
5.0,For the price a great hat and it folds for your bag' yet retains its shape.
5.0,"This purse is the perfect size! I absolutely love it. I have a great leather handbag, however for running into the grocery store or grabbing lunch, it is overkill. I am able to keep this crossbody inside of my larger handbag along with things like Advil and other items I like to have with, but won't likely need on a quick trip. This bag is also perfect for traveling. It is secure when carrying crossbody and has room for my wallet, passport, cellphone and keys, plus more. Overall, this is a great bag and I would definitely recommend it."
5.0,Came on time and in one piece. I am so happy with this product.
5.0,Beautiful my wife love it
5.0,"I have been looking for a pinky signet ring for a long time. Finally found the right one for me. Well made, nice quality, good size and reasonably priced. This is a keeper."
5.0,"I get so many compliments on this skirt, it's a little tight around the waist, but that's just my body type. But, I love it, and worth the price! Nice material too, and ends right above my knees, so it's comfortable enough that I don't need stockings/leggings."
5.0,Shirt is a great weight of flannel for Autumn and Spring. Much higher quality than I even expected for the price. If you work outdoors these are great work shirts.  The Fit is perfect. The person I purchased this for is 6' tall and 230 pounds. He wears it with a layer or two underneath.  Added bonas it washes like a dream.
5.0,Loved this item
5.0,Color and design
5.0,Awesome looking keychain. Works great
5.0,The tags are cute and the the kids loved them.
5.0,"I abolove these pants. There is way more color detail then the pics shows. The fit is great.. I am 5'3, 175 post C-section amyd they fit perfectly, even if I loose some more weight"
5.0,I have small wrist so they were a little big but I love them and used one as an anklet
5.0,"So darn cute! Granddaughter loves them, huge hit!"
5.0,"For the $14 I spent, these shoes were great, didn't look as cheap as most blots like this, add arch support to make them feel better."
5.0,Loved the unicorn patterns- my nieces really enjoyed getting these as a birthday gift!
5.0,My daughter lives this dress. It fit perfect and was a perfect length. She wore it for a pageant and made it to finals. I have nothing negative to say about it. Great product for a great price.
5.0,Soo pretty and dainty! Love it!
5.0,Soft and large!
5.0,Fit my Son Perfect! He wears a 5.5 im Jordan and we ordered 5.5 in these and perfect fit. My Son Loves these and they look nice. Wish the shoe laces were a bit longer though.
5.0,nicd
5.0,My sister used it for her smoothies and she loved it. I have not used it yet.
5.0,"The earrings are really very pretty, but much bigger than I thought they would be.  Of course that's my own fault, the size was listed but I didn't pay enough attention to it.  So if you don't mind big hoops go ahead and buy them!!!"
5.0,I like this hat I wear it every where I go many people ask me where did I get it and I said have you ever heard of amazon if you really like it go get it amazon have it for you
5.0,"It's a nice small little purse just as describing the photos it's about the size of a larger cell phone. I have the LG Stylo 5 and it's the same height as my phone when I have the case on. Exactly as described in the description and looks exactly like the photos. It's very cute and plenty big enough for your wallet your phone and maybe even a small makeup bag. Right now I have my wallet, a small bottle of hand lotion and a pack of gum, as you can see in the photo. There's plenty of room for me to put my phone in there and my keys. It doesn't hold much but like I said there's plenty of room for the basic things. The adjustable strap isn't very long, I have it pulled completely out and the purse hangs right above my hip. I personally would like it to be a little longer but it's fine just how it is. If you're looking for something small and cute that will hold your wallet and your phone and maybe just a couple other small things, then I would definitely recommend this purse but if you are one to keep a lot of stuff in your purse you're definitely going to want something a little larger."
5.0,Shipping was fast but dress was way too big
5.0,I love my pearls bracelet
5.0,Love the size and color. I keep it in my car and pull it out when needed. Great product.
5.0,I love this bracelet i would definitely purchase it again i got 2 other ones blue and black. so cute
5.0,"I love this dress.<br /><br />my sizing: 5'1, 200 pounds, 38C (ish) chest. I got an XL and probably could have done a large, as it is a bit big on me, but not obviously or disturbingly so. It just brushes the floor when I am barefoot, but that's how i like them. I have not washed it yet, so it may shrink up a tad, which is fine.<br /><br />as others mentioned, the seam in the front does not match up. I simply wore it 'backwards' and no one, not even myself, can tell. Simple solution."
5.0,"Love the color, they fit to size and so comfortable, feel nice and smooth."
5.0,Love it! Good quality. My daughter loves it
5.0,"The sit-up expander is great for days when I have a hRd time with my bAck and don’t want to actually sit up. It works my legs, arms, back and abs."
5.0,The sweater is an amazing fit it's comfortable and the lettering on the sweater is on point. I highly recommend this.
5.0,completely satisfied
5.0,Good fit and good looking.
5.0,Grandson hit
5.0,Love this ring!
5.0,"I ordered this tie [[ASIN:B001FRGNLM 100% Silk Woven Fuschia Pink and Navy Striped Tie]] to see if it would match my wedding colors of Navy Blue,Fuschia, and Silver. Anyone who has had to do a tux rental knows the only options they offer for ties are one color with either a white mix or a lighter or darker hue of the same color.  I really wanted something to tie the party together so I ordered this tie.  It was a perfect match to ALL the wedding colors and awesome quality and it was shipped very quickly.  It makes a great wedding gift (reuseable) and I will be ordering ties for the entire party. I just went back on to check availability and noticed they have even added a child size!  :) Wonderful service and quality."
5.0,"Great present,  it was a hit!"
5.0,Great bag.  I love the bottom zip compartment and the slick easy to clean material.  Holds all my toiletries.
5.0,These Apple Watch bands are very comfortable and durable.
5.0,"Love these Sandler’s, have them on now. Want to get the nude when there back in stock. I really enjoy wearing them. I normally wear a 7.5 got an 8 fits perfect"
5.0,Excelente seguro y muy cómodo
5.0,It is super cute! Just as it appears in the picture. Super fast shipping.  I had a similar one before but this one is much  better the length of the chain is perfect.
5.0,"I am 5 ft at 110lbs. I bought a Small size and it fits perfectly, length is perfect to hide 'stuff' I don't want seen."
5.0,"I will be picking this up in different colours. I am a 16/18 US (42C/40D bust) and the XL fits fine. There is a little bit of stretch to the fabric, so you may be able to go down a size, if you want. The only place the fabric is unforgiving is in the bust, so if you're a bit chest-y, order the size that'll fit your bust. For example, if I had a smaller bust, I probably could have gotten away with a large. This does look best with crinoline underneath, but it's not necessary (I wear the crinoline for date night, but go without the crinoline when I wear it to work). You can't beat the price. This is a nice little deal.<br />The only possible downside is that it definitely should be washed on a gentle cycle and then hang dry. There is some type of padding in the bust (or maybe it's the material they used for it) and it will lose its shape in the tougher cycle. I was able to re-shape it, but it's not quite the same."
5.0,My grandson who loves science thought it was funny.  He enjoyed wearing it to school
5.0,"my husband loved it , very soft and comfortable , easy to wash i hang dry them , i will order them again."
5.0,Perfect more than I expected.  Love it ❤
5.0,"This dress is perfect for a “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” costume or cosplay. I was so impressed with this dress. The color was spot on dark burgundy, and thick, well made, comfortable and stretchy. It fit like a glove, and it’ll be warm enough to wear in the fall when I plan on dressing up as Sabrina for Halloween. I can even wear it to work!"
5.0,It is so soft and warm
5.0,"Nice product, good quality"
5.0,"I bought 2 pairs of these Christmas PJs, one for my daughter and one for my niece. These are perfect and washed very well. My daughter and niece haven't worn them yet as it isn't Christmas, but I suspect they will fit as expected. These are adorable and fun, material is soft and stretchy."
5.0,"Love it!  Bought it for vacation, finally pulled it out and wore it.  Love the fit, feel and flow of this dress."
5.0,"These are adorable! The perfect size, weight and style!"
5.0,This fits better than expected. I wear it often!
5.0,"For $14 you get a hard case, soft case, large cleaning cloth, and really cute sunglasses. It’s a sweet deal! They are lightweight and comfortable while wearing. They also arrived fast and in perfect condition! If you like a good deal and need some super cute extra sunglasses I recommend these! If good sun blockage and true polarization is what you’re looking for these aren’t for you. They fall short in that area but everything else that comes with the purchase as well as how cute they are makes them well worth $14!"
5.0,Looks just like the picture and the cap is a perfect fit!
5.0,"This product is Awesome I wear when I workout, to work and when I'm playing sports. Was a little uncomfortable at first but after a couple times wearing it became comfortable. I really recommend this product."
5.0,"[[VIDEOID:b5bbea39f442a6a7359b44da4454f1ff]] Excellent, watch for men and women. Easy to set up and great for dress and casual wear."

5.0,Very soft and comfortable.  Fits true to size
5.0,"Great shirts, super comfortable"
5.0,I love so much I ordered two so when she outgrows one the other is waiting. Great quality. I washed in a front loader washer and it's perfect. Size 70 fits perfect she's a bug baby. Born 9 pounds she's two months and probably weighing 12 pounds now. Order it's super nice :)
5.0,This is so amazing! is big enough for you to use.
5.0,"Great bag, I really love it"
5.0,"Beautiful dress! I'm 5'9&#34; and weigh 130lbs. I ordered the dress in a size 8 and it fit beautifully, not too snug. The fabric is a little stiff but it definitely feels sturdy and the embroidery on the dress is just lovely."
5.0,"My DIVA daughter, a Football Mom, will LOVE this cap as a Christmas gift.  No matter the Season, I know she'd wear it."
5.0,It is great I loved the ear rings they were very light and so beautiful
5.0,It does run small on the ears but for its durability its pretty good. The black is also just right color so thumbs up for that.
5.0,"I cannot comment on size as they are a Christmas gift but they are cute, well made and arrived in safely in a timely manner! The bottom tread is nice and deep."
5.0,They fit well and look great!
5.0,"Great product, highly recommended this line to all my larger busted friends. Great support and comfort. Cute look and doesn't flatten the girls."
5.0,"I love this dress, the fabric is beautiful and very soft. It was a little snug in the bust. I will order more."
5.0,These bows are really cute and well made.  We will be using them in our competition cheer squad.  Perfect and cheap!!
5.0,Beautiful 😀
5.0,"The quality of this snapback is really good. As a blink-182 fan, this hat is perfect for me. This hat quickly became one of my favorites."
5.0,"Awesome. Went in easily, but it was a bit difficult to screw the ball back on given how tiny it is. However it took a few tries and once it was on its not going anywhere. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. Very pleased"
5.0,"It's so perfect! The color is great, the fabric is strong, the buttons are adorable. I definitely do recommend going up a size. I always do it just to be safe, and the dress fitted me perfectly despite being a size bigger than what I usually am. It was a great length as well. It fit fine over my bust (I am a 36-G) and went to about my knees (I am 5'8&#34;). If I had to, would definitely buy this dress again."
5.0,These were perfect for our honeymoon. Great quality and super soft! Runs true to size.
5.0,Me encantan Ami baby le quedan muy cómodas 😃
5.0,Have a tall 7 year old weights 53 lbs great for her unless you are supper skinny this is great for kids
5.0,Best as described
5.0,They’re perfect length for a Medusa (Philtrum)! I was a little worried they were gonna be either too long or too short but the are just right!
5.0,Just what I expected 🍀🐝
5.0,Works Very Well !  Highly Recommended !  These are the Belts to get !!!!
5.0,Feels and fits nice
5.0,Very nice product for the price! I’m glad I found this
5.0,"Amazing skirt, it fit great and I received several comments. I wish they made more in different patterns. Classic skirt!!"
5.0,I really liked how petite this was and very detailed.  Love it!
5.0,Very nice quality and they looked cute on :)
5.0,"I ordered a Medium which is what I normally order, but fit too tight.  Order a size up."
5.0,So cute! Everything I hoped they would be
5.0,"I  am a 34 DD. My left breast is slightly larger than my right, Had a little side boob but other than that, The bras fit pretty well and comfortably. Next time I will just order an XL instead of a L."
5.0,My mom love it
5.0,These bibs are not only adorable but they are very comfy for your little who needs to wear these all day long with the crazy amount of drooling mine does lol! They allow for the perfect fit and dont bunch up around the neck allowing for the best comfort all day! They soak up so much and keep the shirt underneath from getting soaked! Great pack for a great price!
5.0,easy seller to work with AAAAA!!!!!
5.0,"Love the fit.  Very comfortable and cute. I will order more in other colors. I am 5,4 and this dress comes to my ankles. Perfect for flats. The royal blue is very vibrant and pretty."
5.0,Great quality coat!
5.0,Bought as a gift for my mom. She really loved it. It really held all 7 names and birthstone. I wanted something that could represent everyone as this was milestone birthday for her
5.0,"So excited to get these! I went hiking up Mt. Baldy this last weekend and it was super windy. My friend let me borrow her pair of Cambivo compression socks and at first I was afraid my feet would be cold during the hike. Not at all! My feet were warm which kept me happy the whole trip. A couple times I stepped in snow and I felt it melting in my shoe and then... nothing, like I hadn't stepped in snow at all. I'm a believer! Here's to more hikes!"
5.0,This is a lovely fascinator & couldn’t be more pleased.  I was worried it might not arrive in time for the English Tea memorial for my Mom but it came exactly when they said it would.  Color is more light yellow toward cream but am thankful it is as that is a more serviceable color.  Great job!!!
5.0,Very pleased with this shirt! Fits true to size and looks so cute!
5.0,"Best belts ever!! Everyone in my family has one! They lay flat under your cloths, and are not bulky. Also they adjust to every size!!!!"
5.0,Needed a bra that wouldn't show through the open back of my blouse.  Found this while searching on Amazon. Never knew it existed.  There were 3 in the pack so I can use with other dresses and blouses.
5.0,"A little to big for me even though I’m small,<br />More like medium."
5.0,This scarf is so pretty. It is very warm.
5.0,High quality! The logo hasn’t rubbed off or cracked. I have this same lanyard in a different color that is going strong after 4 years as well!
5.0,Very well made. Bought to wear under shear dress blouses well work out well. I like that the straps are adjustable. I really like that it is not form fitting. Can't stand for tops to cling to my midriff even when layering. Ordered according to my hip size so I get a nice loose drape since my bottom is larger than my top. Color is true. It is black & didn't fade with washing in cold water with delicate drying. The price put me off a little until I saw the camisole & tried it on. Well worth it because it is exactly what I was looking for. Oh didn't shrink either.
5.0,"Love this dress. Soft, fits well and hides the extra curves. It is a little long given I am just under 5 feet. I usually wear a 6 to 8 and got a medium"
5.0,awesome product and good price
5.0,Looked great with my husband's tux.<br />Gave it a great pop of color for a formal event.
5.0,"Costume was a hit! Fit just right and hugged all the right places. 😊<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'6, 140 lbs and bought a size small."
5.0,"I love this, it was great for my overseas trip"
5.0,This is a beautiful purse and good value for the price. I but two.... I love it!!
5.0,i love wearing this chain. its really cute and not heavy at all. both women and men could wear it
5.0,Love the sturdiness.
5.0,My son loves these !! Fast shipping! Great price!
5.0,the only thing is a few strings came lose. but i had gotten sweaty in it and it didnt leave any markes which i love.
5.0,It's perfect!!  :)
5.0,"This is a beautiful sweater with a classic feel. It's soft on the skin and looks great with a pair of jeans and some booties. It's got a ""v"" in the back which gives it that classic feel. Fit as described. I recommend."
5.0,Nice quality and fast shipping!
5.0,Prompt on time delivery.  Product exactly as described.
5.0,"Just got my new water backpack and Its way better than I expected. Its  perfect for what I needed which is its not too small nor to big and heavy and it has a separte insulated pocket which helps me keep my liquids cool and the rest of my stuff separate. I even fitted my Ipad for the late night fun. Overall I think its a smart purchase,  plus the people at Atlapa Sports have been very supportive explaning to me how to join the extended warranty program that they have. Enjoy and thanks again Atlapa."
5.0,Nice with jeans.
5.0,Awesome wallet. I barely notice it most of the time
5.0,"My grandmother comes from a time where women dressed for dinner, always wore pearls,<br />and never left the house without a handkerchief. She loved these beautiful and dainty handkerchiefs."
5.0,"Fit was perfect, best compression socks for the money."
5.0,"Love these, wear them every day for months and I've had no issues. So comfortable and durable"
5.0,Beautiful dress! My daughter rocked the butterfly ball in this floor length dress. It was packaged beautifully and wrinkles came out by hanging. It held up nicely during the night of dancing and wear and tear by a 6 year old. I would recommend this dress to anyone!
5.0,"Strong shoe horns , good quality and quality workmanship , both the long and short shoe horns are comfortable to use , the taller unit has special spring to facilitate easy reach and ease of use<br />Delighted !"
5.0,Soo cute ❤😍.
5.0,"Super cute, pretty cranberry color."
5.0,"Note...  If you buy the please know that the cobbler will sand the bottom of the Louboutin to apply these soils. But they make it so much easier to walk on marble, wooden and laminated floors. Its a one size fit all sole so don't worry they cobbler knows what to do when you get them repaired."
5.0,Outfit is true to size. Material is thin but not a bad thing. It isn't a sweat suit material.  I love it and am considering getting another in a different color.
5.0,Great quality wallet. Has a lot of storage and the leather smells amazing.
5.0,Love these so much! Wearing them all summer with different outfits!
5.0,"It's really cute, I bought it for a birthday present to my sister and she love it.."
5.0,Such cute sets of charms! I’m excited to use them for Halloween jewelry making. 👍🏻
5.0,Perfect just make sure you get the right size
5.0,"These looked baggy when I first opened the package but when I tried them on they actually fit really well. I'm used to longer shorts but it's really not in fashion any more., kinda like how cargo pants died a long time ago. You know who you are, get rid of the cargo pants bro. :)"
5.0,"I ordered white and unlike most materials that I easily stain, they washed out easily on this hoody.  Nice feeling, stain resistant, fit was more to the smaller size rather than too big, but within expectations.  Would order again."
5.0,These keep your mask around your neck so it is always handy and you won’t forget it. It also is cleaner than if you are taking it off and laying it on a table or surface.  Without the clips you can use them for eyeglasses.
5.0,"I purchased this for a Swedish friend who wears it almost every day.  The dog tag style is a perfect medium for the beach scene, is big enough for people to comment on, but sleek so that it doesn't look garish.  It also looks great paired with a smaller necklace."
5.0,Super cute but the beads will break off
5.0,"I was looking for a reliable lightweight hydration pack and this one is great. The straps are thick and padded, so they don't dig into me and I feel like they help distribute the weight of the water better. The bladder worked great and held water."
5.0,"O.M.G. my friends, let me tell you about the gloriousness that is this key ring. As someone who deals with piles and piles of keys on a daily basis (I work for an apartment community.) This thing has made my life exactly one billion and six point two percent easier. Not only can I get up to twenty key tags on this loop at a time, now I can just hand them off my wrist instead of digging through a box to find them all. My favorite part aside from the fact that it is SO HECKING PRETTY is that the loop is made of bendable grippy rubber so it doesn't slip around my arm a bunch. The metals clasps are pretty durable so far but with how heavily I use this thing I wouldn't be surprised if I need to change them out for something a little more durable in another few months. For everyday use you'd be set. I 100% recommend this to anyone in the apartment industry, leasing consultant tested and approved!"
5.0,"This shirt is adorable! We just did a cross country road trip to several National parks and I decided to get a cute themed shirt for the trip! I’m glad i went with this one. I have washed/worn it several times and so far it’s holding up nicely. I would say it fits true to size. I normally wear medium and ordered a large for a slightly bigger fit. I’m 150lb, 5’7”, 34B for reference."
5.0,My daughter absolutely loves it!!! Its exactly what she wanted for her birthday AAA+ Would recommend this seller...Thank You its great
5.0,Love it...first time ordering apparel from amazon and I was not disappointed.
5.0,Great small crossbody. It is lightweight and easy access for all my things
5.0,"EXCELLENT finely made rings, delicate yet sturdy. It's simply perfect!"
5.0,I bought this for a recent cruise and it came quickly and fit as expected. I enjoyed wearing it and love the feel of the material. It is very soft and thin enough to not be hot but thick enough to not be see through or feel cheap! I want to buy another but can't decide on what color! I am very pleased with it and have recommended it to my daughter and friends.
5.0,"I take this backpacking to keep my balding head warm at night while sleeping. It is perfect for what I needed: it's light in the pack and keeps my head warm. I haven't tried it in the cold (&lt;40 degrees F) temperatures, but it worked great in the mountains in the lower 40's at night."
5.0,"I love these sandals! I get many compliments every time I wear them! They are also comfortable, which I didn't expect"
5.0,These are amazing. Almost identical to the gym shark ones! Only thing that could be better is if they had size x small in more then just the green! I would definitely purchase more if they did!
5.0,"My favorite undershirt due to the thinner, less-chunky fabric."
5.0,Love will use over and over again
5.0,pretty good quality!
5.0,"Beautiful, high quality silk. My toddler was enchanted. Will be purchasing more for her 2nd birthday."
5.0,"Very comfortable, fashionable and versatile.  Wash and dry well."
5.0,this necklace is very nice looks just the same as it's picture very happy with this order
5.0,Extra warm!!!
5.0,"Pretty solid workout shirts. The fit was a touch on the loose ends, but not enough to be baggy or anything. All in all, I would say they are pretty good workout tanks.<br />I'm 5' 8"" and got the small"
5.0,Sooo cute!!!!!
5.0,Nobody else has cotton sleepwear with the beautiful cotton used by P-jamas.  Their gowns are the most comfortable I've ever had.  They wash well and retain shape beautifully.  I wouldn't be without them!
5.0,"Bought this pants for mom. Fits  her perfectly  including the length. She loves it.  Sadly,  they only had one available in her size. Hope to find some more ."
5.0,"Arrived before stimated time, its beautiful"
5.0,My husband really like the look and function of this watch  what a great band.
5.0,Look like they are in good condition
5.0,Hugs in all the right places!
5.0,uauuuuu.....nice
5.0,Big small and stunning! They are very shiny. I love them. I do wear them 24/7 with no issues. Its hard to find earings im not ALLERGIC to. So im very happy. Plus hasnt tarnished!
5.0,"Ajustada, pero me encanta aunque esperaba que diera más de ancho y menos de escote"
5.0,"Absolutely beautiful dress! I received compliments all day and comments on my photos. I had to take in the bust part underneath the arms because it was a lil loose, other than that.... perfection.  Material is nice, length is perfect for us tall ladies and I was able to flats without them showing"
5.0,Perfect for concert events
5.0,I got these to keep myself from losing my sunglasses while boating and they ended up being better than expected. I had another similar product that I used previously but the cord was so long that it flopped around on my neck and would hit the headrest of my car when driving. The adjustability of these completely resolves that issue.<br /><br />The length adjustment is incredibly easy to use but also holds firm enough that I can use it to keep my sunglasses from slipping down my face - an unexpected bonus!<br /><br />These work perfectly and had no issue fitting over any of my glasses. The grip on the temple tips is secure enough that I have no worries about losing any of my prescription glasses.
5.0,Love this belt.  It's so unique.  Very boho. I gets lots of compliments on it. Versatile
5.0,Wife loves them!
5.0,Love this dress! If I could give 10 stars i would.
5.0,"Purchased these for my boyfriend's Samsung Galaxy 46mm. He loves them, the links are very easy to remove with the tools provided in the purchase. The quality is great, haven't had issues with scuffing or fading."
5.0,"Soft fabric, nice fit"
5.0,"I like this umbrella. It's big enough to keep me and one person dry. It's not TOO big, so I have no trouble carrying it. It's sturdy.  It doesn't leak. It's affordable, and the price I bought it at was good."
5.0,I love this wallet so much.  It is nice and thin just the way I like my wallets to be.  The leather used on the wallet is very nice it doesn't feel cheap at all. There are plenty of compartments for my cards and things. My last wallet was twice the size with the same amount of items in it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a great low cost replace wallet it will not let you down.
5.0,"These came as advertised.  They are so cute and well detailed.  My daughter is getting them for Christmas, so I don't have a picture of them.  They are wrapped and under our tree.  You won't be disappointed in the quality and workmanship."
5.0,"My son loves the feel of these pants. He is 5' tall and 90#, and the size 14 fits great (with ~1/2"" in length for him to grow into). I was worried that there's no drawstring on these because he has a narrow waist, but the elastic waistband does the job just fine."
5.0,"wonderful, she loved it. soft"
5.0,Since this is a Christmas gift it hasn’t been used yet. It looked nice though.
5.0,Look like the picture got it as a gift for a friend she loved it
5.0,Fun shirt
5.0,"This arrived today and I could not be happier. It look better when you put it on in person than the pictures. Was able to open up cuff without fear of breaking it, and it is comfortable I barely realize its on. I recommend this ear cuff for anyone."
5.0,These were as comfy as normal flip flops and my foot wasn’t sliding around in them which was really nice. The clear strap was such a life saver at keeping the sandals on and sturdy. I’ve sent this link to multiple friends so I defiantly recommend these.
5.0,"Muy suave, el gorro un poco pequeño"
5.0,I love the pattern!
5.0,These sunglasses are the bomb.
5.0,"These are really handy gloves, great being able to dig in the flower bed without a trowel or shovel when putting in bedding plants."

5.0,Spouse loves this mask after trying several she picked this one.
5.0,I love these shoes they are beautiful fit perfect
5.0,The design on these is really cute. There is a rainbow on each side which helps my child determine which shoe goes on which foot. Love these as a converse alternative right now when my child needs a new shoe size every year.
5.0,I really like them.  They are light weight and just what I wanted.
5.0,Definitely go for one or two size bigger than your normal size. It is very light and looks like pretty good quality.

5.0,"Es aprueba de agua, excelente para hacer snowboard y mantiene el cuerpo a buena temperatura."
5.0,These work great on my Chamilia bracelot. I am not afraid to wear it now. It was easy to put on and keeps the beads from falling off. I opened the bracelet to test it and worked perfectly.
5.0,I have gifted bag after bag to various friends.  Each have been delighted to receive it!
5.0,"Really cute, and they will fit for a large age span."
5.0,"These were really inexpensive so I wasn't sure what to expect, but for the price, really not bad! The colors are cute and they're a decent size. Also, I have sensitive ears and these didn't bother me AT ALL. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!"
5.0,"Adorable! Exactly what I was looking for. Ordered XL for oversized, flowy fit."
5.0,Everyone who sees me in this wants one too!
5.0,I love this polishing cloth. Easy to use and easy on the hands.
5.0,Great price and great earrings!  Fast shipping too.
5.0,"I love the Mordenmiss style, and was very pleased with this unique &#34;pantskirt&#34; garment. I am 5'4.5&#34;, 180 lbs, with 37.5&#34; waist and 45&#34; hips. These fall directly to my ankles, the one-size fit was perfect, and it will only look more flattering as I lose weight. The material is slightly rough, but a nice weight, necessary for the folds of the garment to create definition and play with the look. It softens enough with a cold water machine wash and line dry.The elastic in the waistband isn't sewn down, but stays pretty much in place. Mordenmiss needs to stock a variety of colors of this winner! Found one in black from another seller, but they are just about out of stock, too. A little romantic Boho vibe that brightens each day I wear it with compliments on the street. Take the plunge--you won't regret it!"
5.0,"Love this, worked perfect for my ski trip. Wasn't cold at all! Will definitely order again on my next trip! Love the little key chain that came inside the pocket."
5.0,Super genial
5.0,"These work perfectly with booties to transition into fall.  They are a thin enough weight to look dress, and are both stretchy and comfortable."
5.0,"What a cool buckle! Not at all cheap in appearance or in feel. It has a surprisingly good weight and appears sturdy. Been wearing it daily for the past couple weeks and so far, it functions as expected. They did a good job of capturing that vintage/rustic look without it coming off as cheesy or cheap. Very happy with the purchase of this very unique buckle."
5.0,The small size is perfect!! It is a beautiful bag!! It is very light and the leather is soft! I got ot for my mom and she absolutley loved it! Even I liked the bag for my self for the everyday work life.
5.0,Great price and good quality
5.0,Looks good and fits really well. My girl loves it
5.0,Perfect glasses
5.0,It took a little longer than I expected it to but the crystal itself was rely nice. It was a beautiful piece I just suggest having a different chain to out it on. The chain that it came on broke the first day. I didn't expect a nice chain for the price but I would of like more then one day out of it
5.0,I bought this sweatshirt for my husband for Christmas and he loved it. It is heavy but not too bulky and is longer in length for a person with a longer torso.
5.0,she loves it
5.0,I love it. It's very cute. Fits my phone perfect. Everyone that sees it says that it is cute and they like it.  I want to buy another one.

5.0,A very nice gift. Super cute.
5.0,Como lo esperaba
5.0,"I like the price of these sport bras. The quality seems to be good. Held up well for the first wash. Color is plain, but that is fine with me, since I wear a shirt over it."
5.0,"I love the Lily Bloom purse fabric from recycled bottles.  It doesn't feel like plastic!  This one is a nice size for every day use.  The pockets give you places for stuff.  Wish it had a key clip inside though, like some other styles have had."
5.0,It's beautiful!  Warm!  Love it!  Thank you!
5.0,Beautiful ring for a cat lover! Bought it as a gift and the recipient loved it!

5.0,"Comfy, great fit"
5.0,So cute💕💞💞

5.0,Fast shipping and beautiful charm for my bracelet
5.0,"This is the first mask I've found that actually lets me breath.  I also do not get any irritation from the mask.  I can't tell you how many I have tried to date, definitely more than I'd like to admit to.  Upon research, I found this mask may fit my needs perfectly without causing harm to my skin.  Perfect!  They do exactly what I was hoping for.  I will definitely be purchasing more."
5.0,"Tapered in the middle, makes for a snug fit, but not overly tight, due to adjustable ear straps.  Very nice deep colors, heavyweight material.  I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,Looks like real diamonds
5.0,I read the reviews before hand so when I got it I reinforced all of the seams. I get so many compliments. Can't beat if for the price.
5.0,Runs very small.  Good customer service!
5.0,Nice geometric climbers! They are cute and they cover up my second set of ear piercings when I want to look a little more conservative.
5.0,Very nice looking and very comfy. So glad I got this.
5.0,"I had the carry-on for years - was undecided for a long time about this size - bought it.  Very glad.  It's the perfect check-in bag if you are going on a 3 to 4 nighter - very tough, very handsome, very cool.  Go Filson!"
5.0,"A little bit shiney, but still very soft, NOT slippery, good thick material, well made! I'm usually an M and that's what I ordered. I'm 5'8&#34; and I weigh 153. The only thing that's a little disappointing is that I wish the length was a bit longer.. It hits me in the middle of my shins. No sign of them sliding down either."
5.0,absolutely gorgeous. The picture doesn't do them justice.
5.0,really cute blouse under a suit or with a skirt
5.0,"This fit me perfect and went great with my Jeggings and Cropped Sweater for my husband’s work party. It will also be cute in summer with capris and a thin shrug. I am a 40D, 5’4” and 164 pounds and the medium fit me perfectly. It is a thin and flowy material that is very flattering and forgiving. I love it."
5.0,"I love this! It fit perfectly although I am usually a 6-8, sometimes am I small, and I ordered a medium. It had a funny chemical smell to it right out of the package, but after letting it hang up a while, it is much better. I can't wait to wear it to the pool!"
5.0,Very good quality. Nice and soft. Very elegant.
5.0,Good quality as aspected

5.0,"Great umbrella! Light, small easy to travel with. Good price"
5.0,Pretty summer dress.<br />Fit as expected.<br />Love it.
5.0,"I love this shirt. But it runs really small for the look that is shown. If you want it to fit like the picture, you need to get it larger. Otherwise it won’t go shoulder and shorter. I normally wear M to L, So I had to send back and order XL and it fits. Material is very nice and is like the picture."
5.0,"This feminine yet rugged outdoors design is sure to please both the female hunter and nature lover. This is a new product, yet to be worn; but looks to be well made and appears exactly as the image presented. The packaging is a sturdy open front brown cardboard gift box with a twine rope tie to hang and magnetic clasp closure."
5.0,"Was hesitant but glad I ordered them.  The fit was perfect and the material is very nice.  Someone complained about the shirts not being dryer machine friendly but honestly it took about 20 minutes to line dry.  I'm 6'1&#34; 190lbs, very fit and the large was perfect!"
5.0,Very flattering and comfy!
5.0,Loved these little gift  boxes!
5.0,These earrings are so cute. Wear them when you want to have fun! Fast shipping from the seller. I would recommend these to a friend.
5.0,"I gave this to my mother for her birthday. She absolutely loved it, she tells me that she gets many compliments on her purse. Very time I see her, she tells me how much she loves her purse. It a perfect size, she can carry very thing she needs and how much she is in love with it. Made me very happy to make her so happy."
5.0,I bought these for my best friend for her birthday and she loved them and thought they were very cute
5.0,"It's better quality than what I was expecting. I think some of the one  and two star reviews are from competators. They buy the product in order to be a ""varified purchaser"" and then try to scare people way from buying it. This is exactly what I was wanting and needing. You can always send it back if it's not for you, but I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5.0,"Perfect fit! Bought the non-fleece ones. I’m about narrow 8.5 - 9 (USA). I selected size 9 (which likely will stretch over time w/ thick socks).  I’m wearing work-out ankle socks in shoes - just right. Not too snugged or loose.<br /><br />The red shoes are so adorable that I just ordered ** another red pair (as back-up in case manufacturer stops making them over time and to replace future wear-n-tear)** and a black pair from same seller.<br /><br />Very soft - yet I love the extra layer around toes as normally soft leather tears at the toes of most leather shoes.<br /><br />As for water resistance, I have gave it 3 stars as I really don’t know how water will do. There’s always sprays, etc. one can coat shoes with."
5.0,"This was my first Amazon purchase, and I was very skeptical because I saw this bikini with another retailer for double the price - so I assumed this less costly version would be a lower quality , but I was wrong! The material is durable, well made, the bottom looked very large until I tried it on (size small) but fit perfectly. I live in Southern California where all the girls where &#34;hard to find&#34; original bikinis and this is one of the best I've seen ! I will be purchasing quite a few more from this brand"
5.0,"So cute, fits great. Love the style."
5.0,"Great quality, especially for the price! Sizing is accurate and it fits great. The clicker bar is a bit loose which makes putting it in slightly difficult, but once you do it a few times and find the right grip it's no problem."
5.0,"I ordered 3 for my grand-daughters. I must say, they are very nice, I got them on black Friday so paid half the price and wish I would had order more. The only drawback is the chain is pretty thin for a child but the pendant look so high quality. Very pleased.I will replace one chain for for a more suitable child friendly one, the others will work for the older ones just fine."
5.0,Simple - Nice
5.0,Falls well and is the statement necklace I was looking for.
5.0,This robe is just as it is pictured. It has a vibrant color. The material is extremely soft and warm. It keeps your body at a comfortable temperature. It washes nicely in cold water and a low dryer setting. It is a great find.
5.0,"Bought this to replace the band on my new Walmart watch. I liked the band on my previous watch, but the size was wrong.  This band is very similar to my old band and at a really good price.  It came in today and so far I'm pretty happy. Some initial comments:<br />* Some reviewers indicated this band is one-size-fits-all. Not true: I ordered a 20 mm band and that's what I got - it fits exactly.<br />* Some reviewers indicated that the pins are not included. Not true: there were 2 pins in the package<br />* Some reviewers indicated that the band material is poor.  It looks ok to me, just like my previous band which I enjoyed for a long time. Time will tell if the black paint holds up or not.<br />* The clasp seems more cheaply made than my previous band. However, I should note that this band costs about half of what my first band cost.  But it looks like it will hold up fine. I'll report back if it doesn't<br />* The length on these bands is infinitely adjustable. It operates by inserting a small screwdriver into a hole on the clasp and popping the little widget upward. Then adjust the band length. Then close the widget.  I found that opening the widget was easy, but closing it was harder than it should have been. I pushed as hard as I could then got out the pliers. It still wouldn't shut. I worried that I'd break something so added a drop of 3-in-1 oil, and that helped it snap shut."
5.0,"Love Leveret products, have purchased many. Just remember, they're sized small. The 12-18 mos. size fit my 10 and 12 mo. old grandsons(who are both on the small side) perfectly. They are now 14 and 16 mos. and ready for the 18-24 month size."
5.0,Very pretty. Bought this for my flower girl and she loved it!
5.0,Real Coach quality!!!!!!<br />Perfect in every way......
5.0,The Sweat Shirt is cut a bit large but I expected that after reading the reviews.  It is a nice quality sweatshirt and the price you can not beat.  Always get good quality wear and a fair price from Amazon.
5.0,These socks are great and worked well for my needs
5.0,Love these pants!  They are super comfortable!!
5.0,This dress is nice and very comfortable. Very good dress for the price.
5.0,My boyfriend loved it !<br />Perfect for those who are active and out in any weather conditions
5.0,I love this necklace! It is exactly as pictured. I wish I could order every color!!!
5.0,My son loves this jersey
5.0,"Super cute glasses, better than I expected. This is my second pair for my son."
5.0,Great scarf I don't know how to make it look like the soldiers do in the photo but it's warm and not heavy.
5.0,Great underwear with a hilarious name. It feels good to wear and supports the Male anatomy.<br /><br />It is a little expensive but you're worth it.
5.0,"I love that this dress is wrinkle free!  I will have to shorten it about eight inches, though, but then I'm short!  I bought it to replace one similar that was stolen years ago."
5.0,"I got these hats as a gift for my parents, who play pickleball. They’re great quality, and the green stitching really stands out. I know they will love them!"
5.0,Bought these for some friends of mine and they really liked it so i guess this was a good buy.
5.0,"Great buy!  Excellent quality. Fit perfectly. Only problem and reason for return was granddaughter needed navy, not royal and she needed a darker gray."
5.0,"I really love this band. I just put it on yesterday but it's great quality and I am sure it will last. That awesome smell of real leather is nice and it looks great with my Seiko SNZG15J1. The width was a bit tight/snug but not a problem at all once you realize, it's just a snug fit and that's exactly what you want. Pulling it through was easy. Perfect thickness that does not bulk up underneath the watch on my arm but thick enough that you know it can take a beating. Perfect length on my 7&#34; wrist."
5.0,"Bought these for my father-in-law. He was having a problem with swelling in his legs. He loves them, says they are comfey!"
5.0,For granddaughter. Loved!!
5.0,Very good style and great fit
5.0,Very reasonable price and easy to put on and take off.
5.0,I bought these earrings for my wife who is an astronomer.  She absolutely loves them and thinks they are fun to wear.  They are much more beautiful in real life than the pictures show.
5.0,"Very nice bracelet, fast delivery"
5.0,"I bought this to reseal my birkenstocks - a much cheaper alternative to the birkenstock brand sealer! It was easy to apply with the brush in the cap, and dried completely clear. The dry time was quick, and the seal seems to have held up very well after my vacation to Hawaii."
5.0,"My husband is a fanatic about the Red Wings... not even from Detroit, but LOOOOOVES tham and hockey!"
5.0,The best workout capris in my closet. Fits perfectly. Flattering.  No tugging or adjusting needed during exercise.  Absorbs perspiration very well.<br />I have 6 pairs!
5.0,"First off, there is NO DIFFERENCE between the CQ-TLP-105 and the TLP-105, they are the EXACT same pants. No problem there. Next, my last pair is the TLP-105-CHC, these are a Dark Grey, “Charcoal”. Next, I am a VERY LEAN 147lb, and 6ft tall and EASILY wear a 32” waist in jeans. Soooo I ordered a 32 X 36 for my first pair, I wanted these in 36” length because I ONLY WANTED THESE WHEN RIDING MY MOTORCYLE IN THE SUMMER. Needed something more cooler and comfortable when riding other than regular jeans.  Ok, now, my first pair was a 32” waist, they ARE A BIT SMALL, if I gained very much weight at all, they won’t fit. So I purchased another pair in 34 x 36, and those fit pretty good but I can still wear the 32” waist pair no problem. So I ordered my 3rd pair and just got my 4th. As some have said, these are kinda baggy in the legs but not bad. Just more comfortable for me when riding. Bottom line, obviously I LOVE THEM or would not have purchased 4 total pair and will purchase more as I have had NO PROBLEMS with them, even after they’ve been washed and made it through 2,  300 round trip mile rides, with it about 84 outside. Oh yeah, if I were you, I’d order a waist size bigger."
5.0,was a gag gift but she loves it
5.0,"Hermosos los dije,  y no me gustó el grosor de la cadena."
5.0,"No dislikes, fits great and does the job as described."
5.0,Awesome Photo Of Bruce Lee!!!!!
5.0,Cute little dress. Love the green color. Washes well did not dry. Thin but I  wear a camisole under it so no problem  Would purchase again
5.0,Christmas gift for my aunt. Super pretty and just like the pictures. She cried when she opened it so I’d say it was a great purchase
5.0,I was expecting it to be a thicker material but……it’s OK I like it. It does fit me loose and comfortable
5.0,"I ordered three different dresses, so to choose the best one. This dress won hands down. I worried about the length, but being only 5'1 end of dress was perfect hitting right above the knee. It looks amazing on and I'm very happy with this purchase."
